Run the events, too. The specimen event drops 5.

The only cases I've seen would seem like huge lore-breaks (Basically over 250 years old without Livia-esque means), so I won't be listing them here.

---
I would like to see someone playing their GW1 character possibly as an Awakened human in GW2. That's quite interesting to me.
---
For RP on my side, I started with GW2 and play an Asura, only intending to do GW1 for gameplay stuff.
---
What's your theory?

Mind explaining this particular one to me?

It's only taking 8 minutes because there aren't any hearts in Dragon Fall. If there were you wouldn't be getting it done so quickly.
---
[Here](http://puu.sh/DwSq5/525b2327b4.jpg) Just for you &lt;3
---
Does it help?
---
I contacted support due to a bug related to one of the Skyscale collections (I completed the collection, but the related buffs remained), last week, and they just got back to me. Normally they're rather quick with tickets, but I was given an apology, and was told that there was a large influx of tickets lately.
---
As a Skyscale owner, it felt really unwhelming for the effort put. I would like this:
---
1) Slower reduction of the flight bar when traveling horizontally or a minimum canopy.
---
2) A larger flight bar with a cost of more masteries.
---
3) I would not like to be penalized if I use a ley-line and mount on top as it automically redbars the skyscale.
---
Honestly, I've been having a hard time with Mistonium and Diflourite, so I get it. Kralkatite gives 25 per heart, so run all hearts on 3 characters and you got it, and Kourna's meta is more repeatable than most in terms of rewards. Motes, which I haven't started on yet, just run Dragonfall's meta and you'll be swimming in them.
---
I'll have to go on every single one of my char and reselect their stats? Ugh. Re ugh. And ugh some more
---
Well, don't take this the wrong way, but your guarantee doesn't mean much. I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just skeptical either way. It DOES make more business sense for them to have more than gw2 cooking (which they certainly were doing). But this new move from NCSoft seems outside of the hands of arena net. I don't really know what they are doing, because I don't really know what NC Soft's impact has on the company.

Man, I hate to ask and look even more dumb, but.... prefix?
---
What do you consider "terrible"?
---
I haven't touched the newest maps but even on the core ones, the design is beautiful, which is a shame because the engine is not optimized at all so people lower graphics to improve performance.

Sausage for the win!

I tried some of them for the fun of it but in the end I was tired/impatient. :) it was fun reading the clues and facepalming for being dumb.

Mordremoth had 0 control over the domain of mind or whatever you want to call it
---
He was capable of influencing The Dream (whatever that actually is since the writers in this game love to leave the lore incomplete) and created false Wild Hunts for specific sylvari to follow
---
But being able to create fake wild hunts is not mind control. Notice Mordremoth had 0  “mind control” power over anything not connected to The Dream
---
The writers were very poetic when saying Mordremoth was the jungle dragon with mind control because he wasn’t actually the jungle (despite many people thinking it was because they can’t understand a metaphor) and he didn’t actually control minds per se. And “Hearts and Minds” is another metaphor for Mordremoth being able to use fake/false Wild Hunts to turn sylvari against their allies, a change of heart so to say
---
And a skin akin to the original concepts where the mouth is closed and doesn't have those weird protruding teeth (personal dislike).
---
Considering how they were secretly taking people away from GW2's development team, and how we can presume that GW2's future plans took that into account, the fact that those plans have barely changed after the lay-offs is an indication - I think - that even though GW2 didn't suffer from the lay-offs, it's not getting a massive investment back either, so Anet is probably still busy working on something else.

What armor pieces are those?
---
Oh wow, didn't expect you to respond ! Ty ! 
---
Personally, since Aurene wanted to show us the skyscales, and since they are born from the mists, and related to dragons - I think they're one of the ways the mists reflect what is going on in Tyria. 
---
As in, they're a sort of fragment of Aurene or Kralk's essence and as such are dragons, but don't have their full abilities ( being able to become an Elder Dragon for example ). 
---
If they're a fragment of both, skyscales could be male or female, if they're just a fragment of Aurene, they might just be female. 
---
Hope this was more or less understandable, English isn't my native language. 
---
And thanks again for replying !
---
Yes. She is someone you believe WOULD actually enjoy causing explosions.
---
I think it's generally rather bland story-wise, but when I played the game in 2012, it felt like a rather different approach and I enjoyed it back then. I am not judging something made pre 2012 by 2019 standards and expecting it to hold up well. The game has come a long way.
---
Besides, its strength was never meant to be that it is an exciting, well-thought out story. The strength of the system is in the many branching options and choices you have for your own character. They stopped doing that, and in exchange, the quality has gone up. They stated themselves that one came at the price of the other.
---
What we have today is very enjoyable. I like both the improvement in quality and other design decisions, such as the abolishment of the dialogue cutscenes.
---
That said, I have a great fondness for the personal story from a Sylvari POV. The shadow of the dragon. Riannoc, Caladbolg. The magic mirror. The friendship that you establish with Trahearne. The bond with the Pale Tree, her faith in you. It might be purely because my first character was Sylvari, but this variant of the story is one that I will always play with a smile on my face. It feels right and somewhat beautiful to me, in a way that other branches (and races) simply did not. 
---
Personal opinion, I guess.
---
I've been running the mod for a while now. It used to crash when closing the game, but ever since I bumped up to 32GB RAM and am i9, I get 60fps (locked) in all situations at max settings. I even run character models at maximum and model quality at medium.
---
But like, nothing ever mattered until 80.  That’s not a new thing.
---
This is a really informative video to show the Skyscale's potential and great research, so thanks for that. 
---
Some feedback from a "casual" mounteer (is that a word?):
---
In general, I agree, the Skyscale is a great mount and I am using it quite alot since I acquired it on Tuesday. One thing to mention is that my personal skills in using mounts isnt as effective as yours, who seems quite good at it. Even though I quite liked the addition of mounts with PoF (while being strictly against mounts before PoF), its not gameplay I aim to excel at, so the various mount race achievements are still left undone for me, while I finished all map meta achievements from season 4. Mounts are mostly a tool of traversing maps for me, getting from point A to B.
---
Personally, I barely use the jackal and the skimmer, until this episode, I mostly used the griffin in general and situationally the raptor (or beetle) if I wanted to cover great distances on ground or the bunny for heights. But since I absolutely hate switching mounts (I dont use 3rd party apps to quick switch between mounts and still click my skills because I am left-handed and there arent too much keys around the keypad to bind skills), the skyscale is a great mount for me.
---
Another difference between your mount utilization in your video and mine in general is that you seemed to have a great deal of map and terrain awareness during your runs from point A to B, which I dont have (to that extend) during my general gameplay. Its not that I am unfamiliar with any map, as I play quite alot, but I am not always completely sure, what terrain is between A and B or dont know the best route and exact gap lenghts (horizontal and vertikal) that I have to traverse. So often I am caught off guard, trying to scale a cliff with a griffin and failing because its too high and being forced to switch to my bunny after I fail. And landing with the bunny is also quite a bit hit and miss, if you dont know the terrain and route well and you need to land on a small ledge, chances are I miss it first try and maybe even 2nd.
---
The skyscale is way more forgiving in those situations as it gives you a better view of the terrain around you and you arent really losing any height either, if you make a mistake.
---
But one thing you didnt mention or took into consideration is the engage skill, which is completely lacking for skyscales in my opinion.  While farming the new map for achis and the mount for the last 10 days, I was in plenty of situations where other mounts were the better option. When doing most escorts, I used the raptor because they happened on the ground and the engage skill could pull the mobs together when they spawned in bulk, when farming multimap bridge events, i prefered the beetle for its superior speed and when i had to cover short distances between mobs with break bars, i preferred the bunny. 
---
But for general traversing of the map (and some other season 4 maps), for example for map currency farming through nodes and caches, the skyscale is my current choice. Especially for Dragonfall, Jahai Bluffs and Thunderhead Peaks, since those are more "vertical" maps than Kourna, Sandswept Isles and Istan, where the griffin is fine.
---
Another thing I noticed: When Jahai Bluffs released, it seemed it had quite a bit more Volatile Magic Node routes than prior maps, especially in the air. Now, as I already mentioned, I am not the most savvy mount user, and I also dont have too much demand for VM, so I didnt really put much effort in mastering these VM node routes in the past, especially the ones high up in the air. While it was quite easy to get there via the Tornado, my griffin flight skills werent really good enough to catch maybe a third to a half of the VM nodes before eventually losing too much flight juice for my griffin. 
---
But now, after revisiting the map with my skyscale, I had absolutely no problem to follow all the flight paths in the air across the whole map, barely missing a node. So I wonder, if those flight paths were actually designed for griffins or skyscales in mind.
---
Anyways, for research purposes, what were the reasons why you chose the routes in the video? You already mentioned some differences and reasons but maybe you got some more insight in that.
---
I am considering to do the same runs over the weekend, under the same conditions to see how an average mount user like me fares compared to you.
---
I was underwhelmed by the skyscale at first but I'm beginning to enjoy it the more I use it, but I have to say as someone who think ArenaNet absolutely nailed the joy of movement on the mounts (with the exception of the warclaw), but the skyscale is a massive miss.
---
The wall grab is by far the worst part of the skyscale, it often feels like a clunky burden more than a genuinely fun movement ability. I hate trying to land on flat terrain but constantly grabbing a wall. I also think the endurance bar not filling while on a wall is completely unnecessary - if someone wants to wait a while to get their endurance back I'm fine with that, limiting it like this makes it feel like a bad mechanic that I would usually try to find another way to scale an objective other than wall jumping.
---
Personally I'd also be fine with the flight canopy never losing height (griffon is still faster and most mounts skip over things anyway) or losing it much slower, but I doubt they will ever change that.
---
The skyscale is the first PvE mount that I think didn't meet the quality of the other in terms of it's joy of movement.
---
Not really.  If you can complete it in one day, but the devs want it to take longer, putting a time-requirement on the reward is a fake challenge.  Putting actually challenging content that would take an average or even above average player at least a few days to complete naturally is the reality that the time-gate illusion is going for.  Arenanet seems to want to make the skyscale "grow" with you, and that takes time.  But instead of adding quest-like objectives which would take time playing the game to complete, they've taken an easy road and make literal time gates, wait 22 days to get the materials for your sky scale to grow.  They could have easily done something like "after completing 50 world bosses your skyscale grows to the next level".  That is still somewhat of a time-gate but it allows people to continuously play the game and work on that objective every time they have a moment to play.  For people who can only log in once a week for a few hours they would love to be able to knock off a few world bosses worth of progress during that time I'm sure, but instead are stuck with "I logged in today and got a charged quartz, I can do that again in 1 week because I won't be able to log in again until next weekend...".
---
Springer is still much faster at climbing straight up a stairstep cliff, and seems to have better evade frames and is quicker at escaping foes.
---
Springer definitely still has a place in my stable.  I've actually found Skyscale taking over more tasks from the Griffon than other mounts, as it used to double as my ATV as well as a long-range flyer.
---
LMAO
---
Oh shit that's great.
---
Regarding your keybind situation i highly suggest trying modifer keybinds (ALT, CTRL or SHIFT + your button). That should free up quite some space.
---
I didn't mention the engage skills whatsoever because i'm not into those at all. Raptor is for great grouping, Springer vor CC, but other than that i don't care all that much about them, mounts for me are more about combat avoidance and travel than initiation.
---
As for the reason why i chose these routes - i travelled around the maps for half a day trying to find good examples. They had to be rather long routes (around one minute) to get somewhat useable results that are not all that prone to margin of error, and to ideally force use of as many different mounts as possible excluding the Skyscale. Lastly i wanted to have a healthy mix of vertical climbs and horizontal obstacles like chasms that are not too far away from what you would normally climb in similar situations, that are not outright illogical as in 20 meters further south being a much easier and more effective climbing route.
---
Movement in GW2 is dependent on your amount of spatial sense in a virtual 3D environment, you have to be your character. Without any actual sense of depth thats an ability that has to be trained even harder than in the real world. Its imaginative and the reason so many people despise the platforming (JPs) in this game. Which i love for a passion, so... lets say i have a natural affinity to one of the most unproductive activities in this game: climbing stuff.
---
sorry but how do you go backwards without backpedaling? assuming you want to keep attacking at the same time
---
do you do some weird mouse turn+strafe?
---
I got mine shortly after launch, I love him to death.
---
Because Anet came up with this wacky new idea that you should play the game I know its crazy right.
---
For Day 8, the rift in Dragonfall, you say it's north and east of the wp.. it's actually north and west.. I was flying around northeast looking for it, then looked at your screenshot, and saw you north and west on your minimap.
---
You're a lifesaver, though!  Very much appreciate your work.
---
Sold nearly 40m luck to drooburt back at the beginning of the year &gt;.&gt;
---
ohh okay i will stay away from it then. Thanks
---
Max settings though, since when don't you lag with max shadows and character models in all situations including world boss and WvW I guess...
---
Don't think about it too much.  Not everyone can play the same game day after day after day and still find joy in it.  Logging in takes 5 minutes to do.  877 days of logging in is still 73 hours of your life that you spent doing other things.  Way more time if you did the dailies.
---
They execute it much better than other games of it's time tbh.
---
I am the opposite. 
---
I love Skyscale and its mechanics. I use it as my main mount because of all those branches and tiny little incline that would stop my raptor from leaping and cause me tiny amount of rage, Skyscale can hover above them and dodge those obstacles. 
---
With Skyscale being a superior climber than Springer, I don't have to get off my raptor and get on my springer. Its clunky and annoying having to switch. 
---
I rarely ever get on my raptor and springer nowadays. Its just too clunky to use over Skyscale.
---
Bruh. Have you even seen elsweyr?
---
Meh, I'm literally just leaving it at this point, don't play enough to want it that bad yet will get it eventually, probably. Usually I rush it but this time it's like eh.
---
Crystal desert zone btw!
---
The Skyscale has an upper "height" that is based on the last position you were sitting flat. Either your starting position, which is wonky if you started in the air from my messing around on the temp versions, or landing on some ledge or tree branch or whatever. Above that the flight bar goes red and you start having issues.
---
d'oh! I'll fix that in a bit
---
Been playing power soulbeast recently. It's pretty fun bursting down mobs by yourselves and feels great doing a 20k crit dmg by yourself.
---
Study color theory. Not like, the nitty gritty. Just have a basic understanding. Complementary colors are easy to find, look at a color wheel and make a straight line across to the other side to find out what the complementary color is, such as blue and orange. Come up with two colors that look nice together and then find an accent color that pops a little more but still plays nice with the other two. Learn what colors look good on what materials. Some colors look better on cloth than they do metal. Choose pieces that have similar shapes and feelings.
---
&gt; I hate trying to land on flat terrain but constantly grabbing a wall
---
Grabbing walls should be a button prompt and the mount should  remain grabbed until we press that button again, NOT require us to hold down forward imo.
---
Wvw should be resetting in a couple minutes around 7pm pst. It is probably the easiest time to capture keeps since they're not upgraded yet.  Join a borderlands and follow a commander.
---
Lol I love the cut off cross on the beetle at the lower left corner, due to layer transparency.
---
Why use the word steal when he had no profit at all (his youtube channel had no ad at all currently) ?....and y he need to steal it when he did many farm route by himself?
---
Sorry, I just feel that it is really inappropriate to someone who did had a lot contribution to the GW community...
---
Honestly i feel like speedrun and meta gaming culture leaves me behind as someone who just wants to enjoy the game. I've been booted from raids multiple times because we wiped twice  when I made it clear im still learning. I feel unwelcome in high level endgame content and unchallenged by what remains, and it pushes me away from the game
---
Honestly this is the biggest problem with the HOT maps. They are so insane and every inch has been so flushed out that it takes a near genius to navigate them without gliding or mounts.
---
I get anywhere from 70-144 fps (I cap at my monitor's refresh rate). I rarely drop below 70, even in Lion's Arch. I'm on an 8700k @ 4.8ghz, 32gb 3200mhz ram, gtx 1080 windforce @ 2150mhz. It's good, but far from the best.
---
wait is this even possible?
---
"In the current optimal route" - I just want to say, there are several places where the route that blew up on here could be improved. I had this incorporated in my route from day 1, but mine was buried under complaints about the timegating and never gained the same traction :^)
---
This is exactly why I buy home instance nodes. I have more than enough with zero farm required. I can even consume the excess to gain VM.  I also have enough Mistborn thingys from running around doing Skyscale collection grrrrr!
---
Are there anymore hard time gates after the feeding stage? I'm hoping to unlock the mount over the weekend (finished feeding stage yesterday).
---
I'm on Skyscale Flight but when I hover the skyscale in the rift nothing happens. I get a Tip that I should "Upgrade my Skyscale to use this rift" but I don't see the Mastery so I can unlock it. But as the OP says " You cannot investigate the rifts without Skyscale mastery 2 and you don't unlock masteries until after this achievement."
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
So how can I proceed?
---
&gt;It's the technical term the developers gave to its flight mechanic.
---
Okay, I understand now.
---
&gt;To reset this box, you need to manually land and take off again, and this is what creates the issue. Since the height of this box keeps getting lowered the further you travel, you need to constantly land to reset it, making the skyscale tedious for horizontal movement.
---
Wall launch gives back flight juice. So you don't have to keep landing and taking off again. It also doesn't reset canopy.
---
&gt;What I propose is for this box to be continuously updated while flying, where if the bottom of your current box is lower than the ground below you, it will raise the box back up to the level of the ground below you.
---
I don't understand this what you are proposing in this post, but I do understand what you say in the original post. So I assume you are talking about that instead of proposing a new suggestion.
---
I feel that something like this will be infested with bugs. If ANet went with that suggestion, it wouldn't be implemented for a year or more with being mostly free of bugs. If it is easy, I don't really mind it.
---
Back when the game launched in 2012, after pretty much only playing WoW and a tiny bit of Rift, GW2 absolutely floored me. Fantastic environments while also having very fluid animations (Rift's characters looked like robots) and it's still amazing to this day
---
True my bad, Sick’em soul beast
---
Yeah, motes come fast af. So they're gonna be after Mistonium and Diflorite.
---
For real, I can barely browse the web on my second monitor and if I try to play a video, there's a small chance the game will crash. No other game has even an inkling of the same issues but idk what to do to fix it in GW2's case...
---
Thematic consistency. If you can look at a set and see it conveys a certain idea, then it normally looks good.
---
Usually I keep the colour scheme quite basic, I stick to 4 colours or less for the whole outfit.
---
I avoid colours that are too washed out or bright, and go for dyes that increase contrast. Brighter colours used as highlights against a deeper backdrop add to the contrast. Contrast makes shapes look more defined, so the outfit looks more detailed.
---
[I like my pirate look a lot as an example here](https://imgur.com/Z7QFUhm) 
---
Too many infusions can look pretty bad, I think people should limit to one aura so that it doesn’t look too messy.
---
I don’t like unnatural hair colours very much, mostly because it is not easy for me to change and natural hair colours tend to be easier to fit many colour schemes.
---
Yup, Tangled Depths is very creative :)
---
Love that map and all its creativity :)
---
:)
---
Making his way through the anime powers, bugs in skin, mini dragons, next maybe he'll grow a few inches taller who knows!
---
I love your comment so much mate! 11/10 attitude
---
Is the ram really that important? I had higher spec than you except the RAM.....
---
the mount programming should detect possible landing in horizontal line and just reset the fuel and max canopy as if you were just landing there. idk what problems would arise from that though, maybe some cooldown would be needed
---
This is exactly how it feels like to do Gen2 legendary and The Ascension (if pvp is not your main game mode). Unlike Skyscale, there's enough variety with legendaries to feel a sense of prestige. Eg. I love whipping out my beautiful and niche The Minstrel because the cool looking Binding of Ipos is more popular. 
---
Skyscale though, meh. It has some utility but since everyone would get it eventually there's no special feeling there.
---
possible he doesn't have it himself yet; so can't do the bug-testing for it.
---
No need for a tinfoil hat now. If we were able to buy too much currency from the Dragonfall vendor, everyone would just permanently migrate to that map for those currencies as well as the general loot which already is better than any other ls4 map, apparently even Istan. Which would mean RIP those maps...
---
&gt;because of all those branches and tiny little incline that would stop my raptor from leaping
---
That's what the jackal is for, btw.
---
&gt; My plan was to showcase the strengths of the Skyscale, so i didn't switch to the other mounts in the Skyscale run.
---
Well, the Skyscale were better in all races and as good as the other mounts in the first race, even though you didn't mixed for the Skyscale run. So you successed with what you wanted to show. :D
---
Dear ArenaNet,
---
Please slightly alter baby Aurene model as a high DPS ranger pet in the next expansion/season. Dragon whelp or something, make it cool, make us all happy. Fire breath, frost breath, electric breath. Give us a cool looking DPS pet using baby aurene model please!
---
Signed,
---
Every Ranger
---
While the wall climb would allow the Skyscale to reach higher places, it would severely slow you down in a situation where an alterantive route exists that consists of one more hop. This ability shines where you cannot reach suitable platforms for standing on within a single flight and it is what enables the Skyscale to climb where no other mount can follow.
---
Some parts of the showcased routes could likely have been optimized by making use of the wall climb, but then i would have had to break my rule of following the same route for both runs.
---
Huh weird, r34 says otherwise.
---
Have you gotten into high end PvE? Raids and Fractals are great content if you only have HoT (lot if not most PvE meta builds still play with HoT specs, so you wont be losing any ground there)
---
Since you dont have PoF, I feel like you are rather limited, because Mounts are literally the best you will find in any RPG, the story gets much better and the season 4 maps are more alive than ever thanks to people farming materials for the Skyscale, so experience each map meta would be better now, since later on with less people some events/archivements might be harder to complete
---
For PvP, there are builds that play HoT specs but I do feel you are losing much more there for not having PoF compares to PvE, for sure, still playable tho
---
Hum... It helps somewhat. Tho we still have the problem of the wall grabbing.
---
What do you do with your exotic armor set after crafting your ascended?
---
Shouldn't be, not for gaming. 16GB is already somewhat overkill for games.
---
lookin' _sharp_.
---
Lack of access to ascended armor, legendary grind being super brutal(which is the point but I have 700 hours played and not much to show for it in that sense), cool skins being locked behind black lion store without good ways to farm gold, etc. 
---
The biggest frustration for me was the feeling that it was almost never efficient to work directly towards an item with crafting or questing, but that the better use of my time was always just to farm gold up and then buy whatever the end goal was from the TP.
---
Oh yeah, forgot about that. Black lion kits for pricey runes, mystic/master otherwise.
---
Just play the game for more than just a week or two after each release and then 2 months not play waiting for next release....occasionally go on those maps , old or new, and you will build up supply of all the currencies and this won't happen to you again next time.
---
every day you can play different stuff and be entertained, yet many people rather log off and then are pikachuface that they don't have enough stuff.
---
I love doing all types contents in the game, I’ll definitely let you know when I have the chance to get on :)
---
Well a good use of my time is to have fun. So I do what I want. If you only want to play the most efficient way, you're married to that style and you'll farm gold...probably burn yourself out and hate the game. I have 23 legendary weapons, well on my way to my 24. Eight characters decked out in full ascended, but I took my time and didn't grind. I did stuff I enjoyed.
---
Half the problem here is approaching everything as goal oriented, instead of experiential. This game is  best played as an experience. The scenary (story, lore, ambient stuff) are some of the best parts of the game.
---
It just takes some practice....or someone to lead your steps. As in real world. :)
---
I still will use springer + griffon.
---
Something I noticed, the waypoint code listed for Bloodtide Coast takes you to Stormbluff Isle waypoint, but that's not where the collection is. If you go to Jelako waypoint instead, the description does correctly describe where to go.
---
My gw1 main was a canthan elementalist so I made my gw2 main to be an as close as possible reincarnation of her. Maybe headcannon is she's a descendant? Idk I haven't thought about this stuff since 2012 lol.

Er... I'm running a beastly machine...
---
i9 9900K, 32GB RAM, 2080TI
---
**MAKE THE IMAGERY STOP** ***MAKE IT STOP***
---
Honestly, they should let you use mounts in dungeon paths just for the fuck of it.
---
Stretching content with timegates is the new meta :&gt;
---
I mean should we do a second version?
---
Good to know. Thank you
---
I like that a lot!
---
DX9 too
---
Unfortunately sylvari were cursed with no bulge
---
good post, i can get behind everything but the double tapping, which i personally perceive as a clunky, awkward and unreliable maneuver in the grand majority of cases.
---
i am especially pro-passive wall clinging. the skyscale so far shines particularly with it's ability to pause and readjust. changing it so you have to actively steer away from a wall would further support that.
---
a suggestion of my own to add to the skyscales usefulness is to embrace its "jack of all trades - master of none" application and further emphasize it. one of my thoughts to do so would be to allow it to hover directly over water for indefinite distances. the skimmer in that case should still be the faster option for aquatic traversal *and* will remain the only mount that can be directly summoned from the water. i understand however that this could end up to be quite the challenge to implement in a satisfying manner.
---
I'm at the point where i just login to do the skyscale quest to its next gate then logout. For a genre that requires players to participate to do different events. this quest makes me want to stay out and pass the time in other ways.
---
If it's taking you 5 minutes to kill personal story mobs then there are some serious issues going on.
---
"Hey fellow skyscales. Look at the glowy thing I got. I feel like a police car now. Bee-boo bee-boo. Hahaha!"
---
Honestly they could easily encourage players to return to any map by having a weekly bonus reward to meta events on a particular map. this would be in addition to any festivals or current events. 
---
Bonus loots, magic find, increased node drops, increased volatile magic rewards .. It would rotate every week - and older players would go back for increased rewards and thus end up helping newer players on the map by helping themselves. 
---
A burst of activity for a mount is just going to leave newer players in a few months in the wind. Everyone gets what they need and don't come back, sticking to more rewarding activities. 
---
So why don't they just make the maps more rewarding on a rotating basis?
---
Ohaidere
---
The collection frustrates me and I keep having to go back to it.
---
The art makes it look good on any setting, its so well done that it will look good for a long time
---
I actually find it easier to dismount and do JPs properly instead of trying too hard to skip them.
---
I only use the glider to save me from some falls.
---
I read that as "**Skritt**lescales" and was hoping for an amusing bug or clever use of tonics.
---
Detective Skyscale!
---
But where is his trombone?
---
Yep.  I held on to it until I was done, and posted it on TP.  Never crafted any.
---
Make it so, Anet.
---
So first he found seven orbs, then got a dragon, became a few inches taller (just a few, to make it look like natural growth). Next up, ruling the galaxy right? Or does he have to beat up a few monkeys (and lose repeatedly) first?
---
No worries, your guild balances out the edginess rather nicely
---
Another (possibly easier to implement) solution for accidental wall jumping would be to have the Mount Skill 1 key activate it instead of the Ascend/jump key.
---
Mount Skill 1 already uses Endurance for dashing, so logically it could be tied to spending Endurance for wall-jumping.  And you would be much less likely to trigger it when accidentally clinging to a wall.
---
Jackal is pretty bad at rough terrain, it can go up smooth inclines but it can't get over rocks or trees or small houses or ruins. Farming S3 zones has been hugely more convenient with the Skyscale other than Bitterfrost (which is largely flat).
---
   So i am returning to the game after about 6 years. I played heavily during the beta burning myself out and upon release i just didn't have much time to invest in the game. Because i want to avoid deleting any older character's due to birthday gifts, and i want what i consider a clean restart (no logging into my higher level characters to avoid accessing their wallet funds). I wanted to ask what are my end game prospects looking for either a Core Necro or Ele in regards to fractals, raids, and PVP? Are either of those classes desirable in end game as skimming searches for them has come up with mixed opinions on how viable they are. 
---
Though, i'll be honest, i am just mostly tired from working and reading about nerfs, and viability with terms and acronyms i am currently not familiar with is just tiring me out more. I have played both for 2 hours or so and enjoyed both. So TL:DR: Between Necro or Ele which one is more desired in social end game content. Also is it hard to farm gold at end game to buy new character slots? Thanks for any replies. Going to crash into bed now, probably.
---
For day 8 there are multiple spots you can go to for each map
---
https://biobreak.wordpress.com/2013/10/30/guild-wars-2-should-get-out-of-the-storytelling-business/
---
6 years old, still relevant. aside from that, taimi the deus ex machina, abandoning most racial content (except asura and human) with the small exception of sylvari with HoT, even then that wasn't that deep. just making the big bads bigger and badder. in general the story is just boring, nothing about it makes me care and sadly i am not alone in that. i could replay the story again and take notes on every single shitty piece of writing but that would take days and it's not really available online in one cohesive mass (i wonder why).
---
Wish my computer could handle this beauty
---
Just so you know there is another collection after the saddle is obtained.
---
 - Complete Jackass 
---
 - Called me "Two-Legs"
---
 - Always had my fucking back.
---
Yeah, I miss Zhed.
---
Yeah, you get downvoted for saying the graphics themselves aren’t good, but the art redeems it, but everyone else saying the same thing is upvoted.
---
Interesting note: I won't go so far as to say it is particularly meaningful just yet. The two dragons who we know the exact domains of, bear a resounding similarity to pairs of [facets](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Facet) from GW1.
---
Zhaitan - Death, Darkness
---
Mordremoth - Nature, Illusions
---
Additionally, Jormag seems to line up quite well with two of these facets as well:
---
Jormag - Strength, Spirit
---
His followers are "recruited" for their strength, and seek power, while also apparently quite interested in the Mists. I'll note that neither of these domains are "Ice". In Glint's Lair, there is a Facet of the Elements.
---
Balthazar's magic was not his godly domain necessarily: rather, he obtained it via a Bloodstone and Primordus. Within Kralkatorrik, his facet was that of Fire and War -- which I would argue correspond quite closely to aspects within The Elements and Destruction. Thus, I'm going to tentatively line up Primordus:
---
Primordus - Elements, Destruction
---
I mean, his minions ARE called Destroyers. 
---
Onto Kralkatorrik. "Crystal" has always been a really odd "magic flavor". However, the very concept of "facets" evokes the idea of a crystal refracting LIGHT. Facets are tied to aspects of magic, aspects of the Gods, and specifically are seen in relation to Glint and Kralkatorrik. I'm going to make the bold move of putting Kralk's primary domain as "light" - the Dragonbrand was created by the shadow of Kralkatorrik's flight path, almost as if light refracting through him becomes tainted with his corruption. For his secondary domain: all three generations of Crystal Dragon could see the future. All three had the gift of prophecy -- of knowing what would come to exist. I'm quite comfortable with the decision to line up Kralkatorrik:
---
Kralkatorrik - Light, Existence
---
This just leaves S_____. 
---
S_____ - Chaos, Creation
---
As I said. Doesn't mean much, if anything. Just another example of twelve flavors of magic in the canon.
---
Mordremoth was capable of mass telepathy across all his corruption, and could even transplant his mind into those touched by his corruption, as he does to Trahearne.
---
It was more than just exploiting his connection to the Dream of Dreams, which his domain of mind did assist since the Dream is a *mind*scape and only people's minds can enter it and influence it.
---
Lionguard, yes, this post right here.
---
Cool thx for explaining
---
Info of this has been out for a couple days. If you only starting the farming now its kinda your fault
---
Still better than being forced to wait, at least the material time gate is basicly set by you and how effecient you get with your farming, not them deciding that I need to wait a full day because fuck my hability to have a choice
---
It seems worse than it is. If you have lots of alts you can actually grind it out in a day or so.
---
this was his plan all along
---
(#s "he didn't get eaten by aurene, he went inside voluntarily in order to better align himself with dragon magic, then after aurene died he took control of the corpse from the inside and convinced everyone she came back to life with some clever voice acting, then he used his new dragon body to kill and absorb kralkatorrik and become and elder dragon himself")
---
I didn’t see the thing till yesterday, and by then it was like 10:00PM and and didn’t have the will to grind. I didn’t discover the reddit thread ti yesterday. Rip. Worst part is, no one is selling the materials.
---
I spent almost no gold whatsoever. I didn't need to buy any materials, and only used the freebie food on the Vabbi one. 
---
I've spent maybe 50g max? More than fair if you'd ask me
---
Yes but I do t have the S4 portal stone. What does it cost?
---
So is this a blog post or a question?
---
Buy all the portal scrolls, taxi all your characters in and do the hearts/meta events/gathering/map completion and whatnot. Or you can choose to go off on your past self for not stockpiling the currencies.
---
I didn’t know I needed the currency’s until it was too late. I marathoned S4 cuz I didn’t get the expacs until December last year. I had other things to be doing than endlessly grinding for something I didn’t know at the time.
---
Awesome!
---
Thank you for your reply! Sorry it took awhile to get back to you. My biggest concern was the staff and rifle being used. If I just stick to my dagger and pistol, would I still be able to utilize the full kit of Deadeye or Daredevil?   
---
Anyways, you really helped me decide to stay with thief :) and thanks again for your reply.
---
Yeah I'm not being serious I just wanted to be able to make that joke for a while
---
You cant sell the materials you have to farm them legit
---
But its not so bad as the original time gate. With alts you get 250 pretty fast. The most annoying are for sute Kourna and the charr islands, since map completion for those 2 only giving 5 mats
---
You can also get 50 of the mats from their PvP/WvW rewards tracks if you have potions saved
---
Thank you for replying :)   
---
I love the extra dodge of daredevil by the looks of it, but I'm underwhelmed by the rest of the kit. That being said, I think I'm just going to stick with it and try it out.   
---
I was also interested in a a Necromancer as a second character. Do you happen to know if that is in the meta right now? Also how can I check what is "in" and "out"?
---
You CAN sell them via 1 person mailing the money and the other guy putting the mats in a guild treasury to be taken out. How much do the portal stones even cost?
---
&gt; Scarlet was basically trying to kill Mordremoth, and the Pale Tree
---
When did they state that?
---
Before she was 'Scarlett' she just loved learning, and learned tonnes with Hylek, Charr, Norn, and finally the Asura. The second she went in Omadds machine, she succumbed to the unfiltered Will of the Dragon. She was always about pumping the ley energy into Mordremoth, specifically to wake him up. When you kill her, shes psyched because she thinks you're still going to die to Mordy.
---
The Pale Tree made The Dream and says Sylvari have choice, and that choice is precious. If I recall right, it's implied that the Pale Tree is actually fine with the Nightmare, because while its great if Sylvari want to make the choice to do good and help others, if they decide to choose being greedy dickbag Nightmare Courtiers over that, it's still a choice they made on their own volition, because The Pale Tree knew. The Pale Tree knew that the Sylvari were dragon minions. The Pale Tree made two choices for the Sylvari; be good, or be bad, because either is better than being a slave to sheer evil.
---
It's a pity you only see mainly "good" Sylvari fighting back against Mordremoth's influence, but you do fight alongside a number of Nightmare courtiers who say something along the lines of "I ain't gonna let anyone tell me what to do, not even a Dragon, that's not what the Nightmare is about", which is ironically what the Dream is about too, partially.
---
Scarlett used Omadd's machine to open her mind up to the influence of the world, past the learnings and prejudices of everything she had learned up until that point, and a slumbering Mordremoth took her for his thrall.
---
But yeah, her descent into madness was definitely a more interesting representation than final-act Scarlett.
---
that's not how it works
---
Thanks for replying! You said that not just thief can make it through end game without specing into another class. Just out of curiosity what other classes are like that?  
---
I'm still new to the game like I said, but necromancer and elementalist are next on my list to try out and was wondering how they fare end game.  
---
Anyways, thanks again for your help!
---
with wallows it's so easy to get anywhere on it... wouldn't bother with it if they didn't have them.
---
Why would it’s properties (in a manner of speaking) be different compared to something that is also account bound. 90% of the people I’ve talked to about it had no idea it existed.
---
Beetle Gang rise up
---
Not a problem.
---
Ele
---
Because one was implemented im 2013/14 and the other way later when they learned how to fix some issues, because if it works on account bound shovels in the 1st place, its a bug and not actually intended, otherwise they wouldn't be described as account bound
---
I just find it very hard to believe that you are the 1st to think how you could possible sell those mats when mats from LS map have been farmed for ages (like people didnt try to sell berries before PoF came out? I find it very hard to believe no one tried it)
---
Shovels are a special case because they have a use in guild hall upgrades, which require them to be deposited first. LS4 currencies have no such use and don't get this exception
---
1000 magic and 50 silver each
---
Ah. Gotcha. Nvm then. I’ll go kill my self now. Thanks Anet!
---
Insane this is a 7 years old game. At the time GW2 came out, Guild Wars Prophecies was 7 years old and felt to have aged much worse. Almost feels like we reached some sweet spot around 2012 where 3D games keep looking amazing even 7-8 years later (Skyrim for example). Can't imagine saying the same about 2005' games.
---
He does, they are on the bottom right of the art.
---
We can safely assume the Crystal Dragon was a teaser. When they talked about it, they specifically said that they wanted the BASE skyscale to be neutral so it caters to most people's ''style''. And that they would allow them to experiment more with skins.
---
Oof
---
What the fuck dude
---
Just take your time gathering the currencies it's not that hard
---
I complained about I different part of the collection. GW2 is one of my favorite games of all time and I hate when this shit happens especially when Anet is in a tough spot rn. I feel like they should be trying everything they can to get their shit together. This pisses off me and many people.
---
Based on just the comments you've made in this thread alone, you assume you know how things are/should be way to much. Best of luck to you.
---
Thunderhead Peaks has 2 super easy hearts - the Dig Site and the Med Kit/Rally the troops one. if you make 3 medkits and throw it between 2 of the doctors you get 99.9% of the heart, grab 1 medicine/suture/banadges and "use" the skill and it completes.
---
the dig site just excavate and kill and worms that pop up. those 2 x 9 characters made that map pretty easy.
---
Domain of Kourna had a couple easy hearts, burning corrupted Crops is really fast if you just sprint through them all and the corrupted ones have bugs fly out and are loud, burn them down and kill any rats (1 hit) you see along the way for rat meat for the cook. Kourna's meta is also amazing for the currency.
---
jahai bluffs has an easy heart north of Sun's Refuge (you can TP to if you have a certain achievement done with portal scroll) where you test branded stuff on test dummies, you can hit 2 dummies at once and the throw item instant respawns. there's also a heart at the very start where you get various groups to cooperate with each other, talking to the marked NPCs gives you a "buff" on your bar that says the kind of person they're looking to talk to. if you match them it's a fair bit of heart progress.
---
i'd check the others right now but there's a server crash and i can't get past my character selection lol. those are just the ones i remember atm
---
Damn. Wait but how many dam alts do u have? Doing all that crap and having r be effective would require a stupid amount of lvl 80 characters. I only have four. Damn.
---
You think those are good? Hah! You should check out the Super Adventure Box!
---
well, neither core class is going to be super favorable to be fair. With the elite specs, 
---
PvE: ele is higher dps, but necro has better support and carry potential. If you want the class that seems more favorable, probably ele
---
sPvP: necro
---
WvW: either. ele is backline damage, necro is more about area denial and control
---
Also, 
---
&gt;no logging into my higher level characters to avoid accessing their wallet funds
---
yeah, that's not gonna happen, all wallet funds have become account wide
---
huh, that's so funny that they do that
---
DH has no modifier for amount of boons, thus it's faster to just add all of them than adding quickness, fury, alacrity, might and retal separately.
---
lol didn't the dev say he was not going to provide support for d912pxy
---
Yeah, that's also true for basically every single MMO too, I can't think of one off the top of my head that put importance on non-endgame content...
---
I whitish say your Aurene skin. I spoke to a Dev in my squad the other day and he eluded to that it's likely since it's an obvious idea and people want it.
---
I don't know if you bought it already, but here is your priority list. Highest priority at the top:
---
- Living world S3 &amp; S4
---
- Copper Salvage o matic
---
- infinite Gathering tools
---
- Shared inventory slots
---
- Bank Tab expansion
---
- Material storage expansion
---
I would HIGHLY suggest waiting on spending anything right now. Wait for the anniversary to come because there will be a huge buttload of sales, and you can get sooooo much more.
---
&gt; I'm not entirely sure what I should be doing.
---
Level 80 Stuff:
---
* Fractals (dungeons with extra challenges)
---
* Raids (harder, 10-person bossfight dungeons) 
---
* Living World and expansion content meta events, bounties etc.
---
* Ascended crafting 
---
* Mounts, collections etc.
---
Honestly, play the story of you want to. I enjoyed it. I enjoyed it and it's a ready source of mastery points and acts somewhat as a content guide. 
---
The first chapter of any given story arc makes no sense if you haven't played the previous one, but power through and the new story will pick up.
---
You mentioned a banjo, now you have to do an epic banjo cover.
---
Can you screenshot those boots and gloves on in Reaper's Shroud for me? I really want to know what they look like in shroud before buying.
---
I'm surprised more people aren't buying nodes when the content is new and farming their home instance daily. I mean it's worth it to me. Even if you don't want to buy nodes, people offer their home instance to farm every day anyway. I  know at least ten people in my guild farm my home instance daily. 
---
This way the farming by now would have been minimal. The nodes exist as a zone reward for a reason. This sort of thing is the reason.
---
&gt;Because i want to avoid deleting any older character's due to birthday gifts, and i want what i consider a clean restart (no logging into my higher level characters to avoid accessing their wallet funds).
---
Great Idea, it's what I would suggest. Funds, materials, and bank are shared across all characters though that's not really an issue.
---
&gt;I wanted to ask what are my end game prospects looking for either a Core Necro or Ele in regards to fractals, raids, and PVP?
---
The core professions will get out classed compared to the expansion's elite specializations. There are still builds and guides out there but most of the time you'll find it hard to get end game groups without at least one of the expansions for PvE. This doesn't matter for raids since you can't play them without an expansion but for fractals the tier 3 and 4 groups will expect you to have a proper build. 
---
&gt;Are either of those classes desirable in end game as skimming searches for them has come up with mixed opinions on how viable they are.
---
The balance is actually pretty good in my opinion, every singe profession has a viable power DPS, condi DPS, and healer (besides warrior, no good heal option there) as well as a few others that fill specialized roles. There will be specific fights and modes where some builds are better than others (fractals heavily prefer power damage over conditions) but in general they all have a place somewhere. If you're looking for a general overall build power weaver is harder to play but better overall than power reaper once you get the expansions. If I had to pick one I'd say elementalist but it's much harder to play and has less survivability than necromancer so you might still want to start on necro.
---
&gt;Also is it hard to farm gold at end game to buy new character slots?
---
Character slots when not on sale are 800 gems. Current gold to gem conversions mean that's [~266g](https://gw2efficiency.com/currencies/gems?filter.conversion_type=goldToGems_gems&amp;filter.conversion_input=800). The better gold farming options are about 20g /hr so it would be over 13 hrs of farming gold. Not impossible by any means but not something you should be rushing towards. The expansions do have deluxe versions that include an extra character slot and some other bonuses.
---
&gt;also i do plan on buying the expansions the next time they are on sale, unfortunately it looks like that may be a few months since i just missed one last month
---
They have been having sales pretty often so hopefully it won't be too long. You can see some [sale history here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/Expansion_Sales). If you don't think you can wait [DLGamer](https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-heart-of-thorns-path-of-fire-us-43911) always has a decent deal on the packs
---
&gt;i tend to play support (healer) or a caster (PVP)
---
Elementalist (more so with the expansions) can be played as a healer or dps class both in range and melee (though melee is generally stronger). I'd suggest [looking at builds](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Builds) for the game modes you are interested in and seeing if they look interesting. Specifically some meta builds would be [power sword weaver](https://discretize.eu/builds/elementalist/power-sword-weaver) or [power greatsword reaper](https://discretize.eu/builds/necromancer/power-reaper) in fractals. In raids the builds are very similar for power [weaver](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/elementalist/weaver/sword/) and [reaper](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/necromancer/reaper/power/) but you have other options like [condition scourge](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/necromancer/scourge/condition/) or [heal tempest](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/elementalist/tempest/heal/) available. Even though they aren't up to date you can also get an idea of [DPS and team compositions here](https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/).
---
If you're getting cold feet from looking at a 3g purchase, maybe you should hold off on this.
---
What happens in 11 hours? The Skyscale is pretty slow, it might not get you where you need in time.
---
I'm looking forward to your followup post in a few weeks about how shitty anet is for making the skyscale fairly slow and forcing you to unlock masteries for it
---
It depends on your computer. If your CPU isn't what it needs, yout FPS can drop. 
---
Most people have found it helpful, from what I've read but as some point in the development if went from boosting my FPS to lowering it. 
---
The latest versions are very stable, so it's worth a try.
---
I'm just trying ftp as a necromancer and I'd like to know which weapon would be best. I'm currently using a staff and it has a lot of aoe, but the damage just seems so small. This is my first mmo aside from tera(played about 4.5 hours), maple story 2(played about 12 hours) and like an hour of trove. I dropped all of them fairly quickly, but I'm trying to get into this one to try it as my 2nd game aside from lol.
---
Being scared of spiders is a logical, rational thing. Being scared of an image of a spider in a video-game to the extent that you'd rather other people don't get a sick webby mount is absurd. I say this as a former arachnophobe who used to have anxiety attacks at orb spiders, before I realised I lived in Australia and wanted to leave the house at some point.
---
Too bad you need a NASA PC to run the game with max settings
---
correct me if im wrong, but enabling simple condition floaters makes it so you dont see the dmg ticks synced to the player actually losing health
---
why.. just open champion bags on it. not unid bags.
---
&gt; Seem to make sense to me You are fighting the dragon itself while he is burried, what other ending is there to have? You will not kill it because that is for the story, amd since its not a champion you not gonna fight it till it dies, because of what I already said, so seems pretty logical to me the way it ends
---
whilst i dont agree that there needs to be more (aside from the map closing due to players leaving after camps are established; im fine with what we got)... but for the sake of debate; theres plenty of other things that could happen; like multiple shatterers appearing; hell have each camp have its own shatterer with warfire/death/vineyshit that it has to deal with
---
i mean if can't play a ton in 1 day then the hearts reset anyway so you don't need as many characters as i did lol
---
Nodes cost 50g plus an insane amount of volatile magic though
---
Yeah. It is nice to see the maps busy even if is for a limited time.
---
I can squash those beetles in my sleep now lol
---
Did you just complain you'll have it in a matter of days?
---
And farming someone's home instance, which I see people offering and asking for every day is practically free. If you get between 1-2 gold worth of stuff and throw a guy 20 silver, you're still well ahead of the game and you have the currencies. 
---
50 gold may seem like a lot to you, but it's a no brainer for some of us and again, for those who don't want to invest, there are people offering and asking all the time.
---
What happened to his voice actor? Did he go on a four month long bender or something?
---
Does this autoharvest or do you still have to press F on something? Do you have to be next to a harvest node to start it?
---
I disagree.  This has been my most satisfying Dragon kill -especially if you include the All or Nothing auditorium battle and Dragonflight sections.
---
The meta *finale* might not be as climactic, but I've found almost everything else to be more enjoyable.  The Dragonfall map does an incredible job of blending free-roaming with meta events, and the 3 "lanes" offer more variety than Dragon Stand's.
---
thats what you get for ignoring the maps, achievements, rewards and complaining that there is only "content for 2h each 3 months"...
---
(not only speaking to you OP, I am saying that to everyone)
---
This dragon kill is copy pasted from ds. You kill drahins essence in a phased instanced battle while metw event above deals with its body. How is that different from mordremoth besides being discount version of jungle dragon fight?
---
there are plenty of current event events in the lower starter zones though.
---
its good for older season 4 maps. it helped season 3 maps with the release of episode 6 (LS3) and it helps now.
---
Youre probably going to he using a power build, so getting a set on the tp should be a good start. Look at them from the stats, power, precision, ferocity, with power being the highest stat, and pick the cheapest of each armor slot, including trinkets and weapons. Should be around 30 gold total with everhthing and cheap runes.
---
Hi! Congrats on hitting 80. It's 2am so apologies in advance if any of this doesn't make sense. 
---
TL;DR Check out different things and see what you think is fun. 
---
Here are some things to do:
---
1. Gear up. If you're playing a power class, you're probably going to want zerker gear. Go for exotics (orange text) that you can buy off the TP for not too much money. Eventually, you can go for ascended, which is a lot more complicated. There are good gear guides out there, I don't have a link on hand right now though. There might be one linked in the pinned post (question thread). 
---
2. Play through any story you haven't played through yet. It's really interesting backstory. Plus I believe you can buy S2 with gems and play through that on a free account too.
---
3. Check out open world events, world bosses, etc you haven't done yet and see if there's any you really like. For world bosses, I recommend giving Tequatl a try. Some maps have cool metas, like the Silverwastes (which is also one of the best gold farms in game). 
---
4. Give dungeons/fractals a shot. Fractals are more recent than dungeons, all level 80, and more populated; dungeons are older content but some people do still run them. I'd definitely recommend fractals personally, they're my favorite end game content. There's 100 levels of them, so there's plenty to keep you occupied.
---
5. Explore the world! You can work on 100% map completion, which you'll need to craft any gen 1 legendaries, and every map has a \~20% chance to drop a BL key. Plus you can learn about the world we're playing in or just try and find new places and/or events you like to do.
---
6. Check out PvP or WvW if you think you're into that. I can't speak much for either of those game modes but I really enjoyed PvP the first time I gave it a shot.
---
7. Make/level an alt! New characters are always a good time.
---
8. Fashion wars - play around in the wardrobe, find some skins you want, figure out how to get them and get working.
---
9. If you don't have the expansions yet (I'm just assuming you don't in this guide), get them. Elite specs are a lot of fun to work with and most "meta" builds for end-game content will use them. HoT has four really fun intense map-wide meta events, masteries are really cool (and give you more concrete goals to work for as you try to unlock/master them), PoF has maps, both have additional interesting story options. Plus then you'll be able to buy and play living world episodes from LS3 and LS4, which adds even more story, achievements, and events to do.
---
This was really long, but I hope it helps give you some inspiration for things to check out now that you've hit level 80!
---
Staff on Necro is probably one of the worst weapons in the game if you want damage.
---
As F2P you don't have that many options, as condition damage builds (damage through bleed, poison etc) lack the skills/gear expansions give you.
---
So you want to focus on Power. Good weapons are Dagger for melee mainhand and Axe for ranged. Focus and Warhorn are both good offhands. Staff can still be somewhat usefull, but you eventually unlock wells in your utility slots, and those deal far more AoE damage then staff. Dont bother with Scepter, as its a condition damage weapon only.
---
Do also note that a lot of damage comes from your shroud (F1), so use that if you want damage too. It's not just a secondary HP bar.
---
Not everyone is worthy of Skyscale and thats okay.
---
uniqueness, applicability to different situations, interesting shape design and silhouette, appealing colors...
---
same principles as fashion design i guess
---
Aight thanks. Btw how do I get weapons? I had a trident and a warhorn, but they disappeared from my inventory. The only way I've been able to get weapons is by leveling up. I couldn't use the trade poll either.
---
Seriously, ANet's laziness reached a point I can't even believe. 
---
War Eternal looks like a season finale of a tv show that is going bad but they need to finish it, so they try to connect some loose ends and give you half the content of the previous seasons and that's it.
---
This new map lacks achievements and actual challenging content. The whole plot was built in a rush and the map lost it's purpose as soon as the collections started. People realized they wouldn't be able to progress unless they RUSHED the whole step in a single day. 
---
Sounds like ANet wanted to spread players around old maps with a poorly designed system/collection, but they just caused hate among players. 
---
But the real problem isn't the timegated content, after all. The real problem comes when they make us collect ***250*** of each currency from LS4. Seriously? Some of them are incredible time consuming to farm. You need to repeat the same events/hearts over and over like a robot. It just makes you want to finish the collection and leave GW2 for a few months.
---
Fortunately I have 8 characters to do map completion at Jahai Bluffs, but what about the people there farming rifts like crazy? This event is just A PAIN. There are lots of enemies, the riftstalkers are strong as hell, you need a bunch of people to complete, you need to kill THREE riftstalkers per event and you will probably die A LOT for what? 5 currency. 
---
On the other hand, I'm sitting on piles and more piles of kralkatite ore, and all currencies need the same amount: 250.
---
Sometimes I ask myself why I still play this game since it's more and more like a freelance job.
---
Aight thanks. I'll try dagger and seeow it works. I was losing a lot of health with the axe tho. Btw which weapon lets you summon minions? That's kinda like the main thing I wanted to do xd.
---
I like the "Tyria is a sleeping dragon" theory but I dunno if they'll avoid that because it's rather close to WoW's "Azeroth is a sleeping titan" thing?
---
That being said, the centre light being the original dragon/being that spawned/birthed/created the others would be really cool.
---
GW2 has never been about leveling (same as GW1). Leveling to max is only the tutorial for the game (which anet decided to make longer for GW2 to meet conventional MMO experience a little better), but the franchise has never been about collecting experience points..
---
for the love of God, BANK TABS. and I don't mean 1 you gonna need atleast 2
---
You are over thinking it. You've said it yourself that you're new so your dps being lower than, for example, an experienced veteran who knows the content inside out is to be expected. Just play the game and loosely keep track of your dps in the background.
---
As you play the game more, it will naturally increase as you'll be able to do your rotation more and more efficiently even in the heat of the moment. You'll learn the fights and get the hang of break bar timings and you'll begin to think "oh, this boss is more vulnerable during this phase and I can unload my burst damage here".
---
Try not to obsess about it and fall into the trap of tunnel visioning into your dps and you mess up a mechanic. Heck even if this does happen don't beat yourself up over it because I can guarantee it's happened to everyone at least once.
---
The dream would be to play this game on all max settings plus reshade and always hover between 70-90fps
---
(I was taking that into account when writing my comment, just for telling OP that his complaint is not shared)
---
Every time you complete a heart quest, the heart person turns into a vendor and you can buy gear. They mostly have 3-5 items.
---
You can also buy gear from vendors with a little sword icon above them in many towns and camps.
---
there a so long gaps between the episodes, 50g and VM shouldnt be a problem to get before each new release.
---
how is that shitty game design, when the reward is an overarching reward for ppl who played the whole season?
---
aw na yo name is guildwars everything you ever say is biased!
---
Too complicated for me to install but then again I don't want to as they say to expect bugs etc.
---
Tbf he usually is given some booty too but couldn't with the pose I had to use. 🤷‍♀️
---
Hey, is there a build for this you could link to me please? Or would you mind giving me a quick rundown on the build?
---
Maybe they got Zojjaed.
---
jump on raptor&gt;go to lower side of inclinwe/decline (you can catch the ball mid jump, but if you're too night -like from starting on the high side of the incline- it wont count) after you send the ball back&gt; zoom to zone if too far to walk... dont even bother looking at the skyscale; just look at the floor
---
Yeah they feel like a chore for me as well haha
---
Dunno about animations but the world design of Gw2 is the best I've ever seen. It makes me feel like I'm in a wonderland. The designers have so much imagination and every corner has a detail.
---
&gt; sorry but how do you go backwards without backpedaling?
---
You don't - always go forward or sideways. If you want to attack something behind you, turn the camera around to face it instead of slowly walking backwards.
---
the skyscale made me no longer care about gw2. weird thing is, i felt liberated about it. i still play it but not as regularly as before. but whenver i logged in, i remember that stuff i have to do for skycale, and i just exit the game.
---
i dunno man, i like gw2 a lot..  but the hassle of the skyscale makes me alt+f4 after logging in :(
---
I will say I do love that they have made this a thing for events or quests that might be a pain in the butt.
---
Bugs aside I hope they make more do A, B or C options to complete collections in the future
---
If a 3rd party person can implement that as a mod, I think anet can make it better themselves. I have a PC with 9900k/1080ti and still having fps drops/low fps when the area gets crowded. The game doesn't use a good portion of hardware capacity.
---
Notice how you have to use A and D instead of W to avoid the fucking auto-grab
---
He was secretly a Danzig fan and was just trying to belt out a tune before passing on.
---
You have little to no reason to believe as you believe. I'm not even sure I believe you at this point.
---
Write a ticket to arenanet and they will unlock functionality. That is what I did.
---
I'm just laughing now when I see people saying they won't get the skyscale cuz it's useless, in two weeks they'll see how cool it is and just do the collection haha
---
True
---
The last gw2 comic puts a whole new spin on this one...
---
It looks even better without that much bloom. Seriously, you should try it.
---
I thoroughly enjoy dagger+dagger for up close melee and axe+focus for ranged.
---
Praise Joko
---
i kinda like timegating.  keeps those of us with less time to play in the loop.
---
Twilight is looking better than Exordium.
---
Hold my beer. Opinions are coming.
---
With 15fps yeah.
---
How good is Greatsword? Turns out it's pretty good.
---
The event is on a hidden timer so that folks don't repeatedly trigger the event and farm it.
---
Probably shouldn't have been made part of a collection.
---
Dunno why, but it seems pretty common. I had to do it and so did several others in my guild.
---
Sounds like you've not been around long or you'd remember how we used to wait for a year for new content, or used to have content patches with a fraction of the content mass we get nowadays.
---
[deleted]
---
Or you can just read the novel Edge of Destiny which does a much better job of telling that story than the game anyway. lol
---
Yeah, personal story is pretty crap. Know that it gets a bit better with Living World Season 2, and it gets MUCH better from Heart of Thorns and up.
---
If used properly is quite vague. Even using it properly it's quite more useful imo to do griffon hops, swap to bunny when that's not enough, use the skill to dismount at maximum altitude + glide + griffon back again and maybe sometimes use the skyscale for a dash at that maximum heigh. However, just using the skyscale is a NO for me, while using griffon most of the time is fine.
---
they are non profit and randomly blockpeoplefrom buying gems so they don't earn money
---
The rift events take a huge amount of time if they're scaled up with lots of characters. If there's no one around, conversely, you can actually solo them (basically just kill a few vets) and be done in about a minute, because they don't spawn additional events with no scale-up. Really quite unfortunate.
---
Also if you have home portal stone, use it to skip tutorial, then exit home instance and run back to starter zone to receive reward xp which makes you instantly level 2.
---
Caution, only works with races which have interactive doors out of home instance, eg doesn't work with sylvari. Charr have shortest from home exit to starter zone
---
I don't know that I can say I hate the level 80 personal story, but it's definitely not fun. Intellectually I'm doing something. That is I know what I'm doing and why. The game does provide reasons for most of what you're doing. But the missions themselves aren't fun missions.
---
The last mission was a bit more fun when it was a story dungeon as opposed to a solo mission like it is now, but it's still very long, and very drawn out.
---
Thank you for the reply. :)
---
Nah Kralk is probably calling Aurene a mommy because she is the first dragon of her type and all Dragons stemming from her will be different than the Elder Dragons.
---
He can't aee it anyway so why bother?
---
I'm looking to roll a light armor alt thats good at open world and fractals. Any suggestions on professions and builds?
---
They should just revamp the story dungeons for the sake of making it soloable anyway.
---
Achivements need them.
---
Orr in general is featureless, though the lack of hearts is a boon when doing world completion. Reminds me a lot of the deserts and plaguelands in vanilla WoW - top level zones without content. Guess all those suffered from time constraints.
---
I've heard (not sure if it's true) that the Zhaitan fight was supposed to be much more epic - bringing him down with airships and then finishing the fight on foot, which the technology/code back then couldn't quite handle. If so, they've paid a nice homage to that from S4E5 onwards...
---
Oh my god Karen, you can’t just go around and ask Charr to cut half of their arms off!
---
Yes it is quite unfortunate that there is no separate hotkey for it.
---
Another way you can avoid it is by banking on your momentum, then foricbly floating down until you land somewhere. But that is not optimal either.
---
Those wouks be my builds too after crafting Sharur because the only good hammer build is WvW Herald.
---
My main problem with exordium is elder wood. lol
---
Listen here Stephanie, I can do what I want to. \*Turns back to Anet\* I'd like to speak to your manager.
---
Elementalist are first on the queue!
---
Pretty good job right there.
---
If the performance wouldn't suck so hard....
---
Not really... I reinstalled windows entirely (worked fine on the earlier OS)
---
Now it says allways bin64 wrong directory.
---
Moved folders around. Installed gw2 and the hook new. Still the same issue... Sadly.
---
Call me a masochist but I don’t like using my mounts to complete puzzles because the puzzles are the most fun thing about GW2 to me.  No puzzle too small to complete without a mount.
---
In fairness to most other people, they’re likely just doing map completion on alts because they’ve been playing for so long that they’ve already 100%ed more than one character. I know a few of those players and they have little tolerance for foot travel.
---
They have stated multiple times that they do not hold content for large amounts of times just to be multi-releases. I wouldn't mind more raid and fractal releases at all, but there is a larg(er) casual audience so I understand that they have to balance the work they put into different types of content in a way that provides different types of content in a sensible fashion that caters to the demographics as they exist.

Trying out something different retelling Guild Wars lore through song.

Ideally, I want it to be as if Aurene is singing about overcoming her traumatic death when she was dead before AND after her re-awakening.
---
This music story is also a tribute to Aurene, her allies, and the late Monty Oum.
---
After I upgraded my computer and monitor I came back to this game to find that it works surprisingly well in ultrawide. 3440x1440 and good fps on "best look"setting. Until big events or wvw of course. Love this game!  
---
This is on a 7700k, 1080Ti
---
I'd say that is exactly the strength of HoT maps. To me it was so fun to have a big map that you couldn't navigate blindly after one day. It made it feel big and like an actual jungle. And why would *not* have a glider?
---
Now, I did play HoT at launch, so back then you spend a lot of time in them and learned them bit by bit. It was fun you knew some areas, but kept finding new places and got familiar with them until you finally knew the whole zone.
---
If I joined in PoF I might have seen it differently. It was exciting at launch and everyone played there, it was full of life. If I joined GW2 in PoF I might just go there for achievements, Skill Points, etc. and it would probably become annoying quite fast.
---
I guess in a way the HoT maps aged quite badly in terms of gameplay, but for playing in HoT it was really fun.
---
You’re the kinda person I do JPs on Mesmer for :)
---
To be fair, plan or no plan, people are right to be dissatisfied with the rate of raid releases. Of course we can't expect Blizzard's cadency given the company size and revenues, but the current rate is ridiculously low.
---
Conjure weapons are dumb. I hope they remove them some day, and replace them with weapon swap.
---
Amazing graphics, not really... it's the art style that is amazing, testament to that being that six or seven years later it still looks "amazing".
---
I think timeless is kind of a better word for it :)
---
I think compating to these days Gw1 had great e-sport potential.
---
Why is story mode better experienced solo? I don't understand that. I don't really find much content better solo at all, and certainly not story dungeons.
---
Just ugly
---
I would like to notice fact that we already have two light professions who can use GS and two heavy who can use GS. Time for medium. Since Engi got sword I would prefer Thief to get one but whichever is fine by me :P
---
Personal Story.... campaigns.....?
---
Anet has shot and missed their cadence on releasing content. My guess is that they were running the game in maintenance mode for the beginning of LS4, were going to go to LS5 and then give us something new. 
---
They had an intern, a literal intern, make Lair of the Snowman, a boss who has more mechanics than many other bosses in raids. Hell, give us another 1 boss raid from an intern, polish it up and then we have something, instead of them not producing content.
---
To say that we give them shit because they can’t hit the goal that they, themselves gave is asinine. If they are silent, then we expect nothing, if they say something, we can and should hold them to it.
---
Love the graphics
---
Wow. Nice!
---
Thank you man!
---
Hoe do I get the viper set? Can I buy it off TP?
---
Got a dirt cheap 80 set with prec/pow/condi to start with.
---
And the Eibhear Finn. How would you rate the Torch vs Warhorn?
---
Torch better?
---
It is important to note that the size of the demographic that regularly play raids and/or fractals is probably affected by the attention devs give to these content. We see more and more guilds disbanding even here on reddit due to how infrequent the raid releases are. 
---
It can be argued that the focus on open world content compensates this loss of players as it is what new players want, but there is a significant amount of people coming from WoW because their current expansion is bleeding out. These players are used to having their main content as raids. 
---
The WoW refugees can also be expected to spend actual money on the gem store and whatnot, since they are used paying due to the subs from WoW and we have stuff in gem store that require regular purchasing resembling subs (see new mount skin pack releases, War Eternal prep package etc.). I am not saying gw2 should be a WoW clone, but if devs want these players to stay and not just abandon the game in a new WoW expansion, they should place a bit more emphasis on organized PvE content.
---
I guess it depends on the percentage of the playerbase that actually raids. For 3.5 years there wasn't a single raid in the game. Somehow the game seemed popular back then. Raids wasn't some magic bullet that made this game more popular even though certain people undoubtedly like them.  I'm pretty sure if most people raided, we'd get raids faster.
---
Some account were secretly being stolen, hackers use fake/stolen payments to charges these accounts without the owner’s notice, then use the get buy gold, then send gold to RMT buyers.
---
I believe there was a post about it once before.
---
looks like devil trigger Virgil from DMC5
---
&gt; If they are silent, then we expect nothing
---
And if they are silent people rage like little kids not getting any information at all.
---
I totally agree that they should communicate. BUT people need to understand what a plan is and understand that plans doesn't always work out. Or do people really have such easy lives that every single thing they ever plan always works out perfectly?
---
Awesome to know. I just got approved to have my account back after it was hacked and permabanned years ago when I stopped playing. But I had to write out a paragraph telling support what I have done to prevent compromise in the future before its unlocked 😂😂 so was curious if I would have to wait until Tuesday to hear back from them because of the holiday
---
That's too much edge
---
How do I skip all the jumping puzzles? Just use the treat when I'm in the map or near the icon?
---
Exactly! There were some JPs for sunrise precursor collection. Some were easy enough to me, two of them were not: Southsun cove JP and that Not So Secret.
---
The first one I got help from a guildie and the second from some anonymous player who kept doing it and helping players around, just for the pleasure :)
---
So I thank you you and all others JP lovers who help us!
---
Dragonfall and BFF should be optimal for trinkets
---
A bit too much bloom for my taste but yes it looks nice.
---
Easily the cheapest writing moment in most of GW2's history.
---
I did discover one spot in Bloodtide Coast I was missing for 7 years: Risewild Hills, on the eastern map border rocks there's small entrance to most likely some sylvari lounge
---
Tbh though, dragonfall is stupid good rewards, it’s a bit absurd.
---
I'd argue differently. I have a pretty solid Eternity setup. It does look better at night, but still is good during the day.
---
I am really scared of the jumping puzzle part. :&lt;
---
&gt;We are planning to release raids with more regularity this season.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7g7wds/living_world_season_4_daybreak_devs_here_ask_us/dqh6bac/
---
Is the exact quote. They are quite clearly saying that they are PLANNING on doing it. They do in no way or form promise anything.
---
If they had said: We will release x raids every year then it would have been false marketing, but they never actually said that. Nor was the comment made for an expansion, but rather for a living world season, which we don't have to pay real life currency for in the first place. 
---
Please check up on facts before making comments like that. Especially when comments talk about something that is a criminal offense.
---
Main thing I'd want them to do with conjures is make it so that once you use a conjure, that conjure becomes your weapon swap for the next 60s (if you use another conjure before that time is up, the new one overwrites the existing one), and can freely swap to and from it, but with the usual 9s CD on weapon swapping.  Obviously this'd only apply to the Ele using the Conjure, anyone that picks up the spawned version it just acts like a regular bundle item.
---
I was planning on buying next big xpac for gw2.
---
You don't understand, if they would say they would release 1 raid wing per year I would not buy anything from anet since wing4 came out. But they didn't and in fact they said the opposite.
---
&gt; Especially when comments talk about something that is a criminal offense.
---
XDDD
---
Can anyone tell me what is the best way to make money in new map? Sell rares or just Savage for ectos?
---
No, they didn't say the opposite. They said they PLANNED. The fact that you don't understand what a plan is, is a you problem not an ArenaNet problem.
---
And yes, false marketing is a criminal offense. So you shouldn't throw it around when you clearly don't understand what it means.
---
Not all sylvari and mordrem are connected to the Dream. He was able to influence the Soundless too, and by what we've seen the Shadow of the Dragon is the only mordrem connected to the Dream.
---
He was able to get into the minds of non-sylvari when they got close to him, too, though. We see and hear him during the fight with Faolain and through Trahearne regardless of the PC's race.
---
PTSD from crafting Nevermore. I don't know how many elder wood trees got destroyed to create that spirit of nature weapon lol
---
So, some cross between ninja and samurai?
---
Yeah I agree that putting reverb on everything would have cluttered it up too much. I would've personally made the vocals drier so they sound more like they're in the same room as the instruments :).
---
The line that stuck out to me was "Hope's just a sunrise away". The "s" after hope doesn't sound audible to me and it sounds like there was some kind of cut. Might have just been how the vocalist sang it though.
---
Really nice work overall, looking forward to any other GW2 arrangements you guys do!
---
I think it'd be much more interesting if the new spec was a "shadow mage" similar to some of the folklore around ninjas.
---
Give it the focus offhand and perhaps a spec specific condition for a blind that actually works (i.e. you can blind more than just trash mobs) but doesn't stack (just refreshes a short duration). Replace steal with spraying smoke in front of you in a small cone that applies this "super blind". Add the super blind to some traits and maybe one of the focus skills. The goal would be to make it sparse so it can't be spammed.
---
That could enable the thief to play in a tank or support role. The rest of the traits would decide which. But being able to actually blind powerful enemies would either help them tank, or help others tank, and still focuses on an active playstyle (you need to time the blind carefully so it actually works).
---
All dungeons offer exotic rewards. You can also buy full armor sets with karma in gods' temples in Orr.
---
Is karma generally useful? Is blowing it all on this a waste?
---
I know what you mean but I’m having a good time. :)
---
raid character in the aerodrome. just where ya belong
---
Dungeon token
---
The only other major thing I can think of spending karma on would be obsidian shards for legendary crafting. There are plenty of places to spend karma and you'll always want to carry some around in case you find something you like, but pretty much anything other than exo gear and obby is generally pretty cheap as far as karma cost.
---
It's not unusual for endgame players to be walking around with hundreds of thousands or even millions of unspent karma. You will earn a lot of it.
---
Dont use it for armor. Just run citadel of flames for a few days
---
This exactly.
---
While I do agree that Tyria is actually a supermassive cluster of fractals, I only think that of the Tyria players experience, not the actual canon Tyria.
---
So while maps and events loop in time, that's just because we are actually playing in an echo of the actual Tyria, as echos of the the commande in different alternate versions of Tyria, and different versions of the commander that are not the commander in other alternate versions of Tyria.
---
That neatly explains why events reset and why the playable characters can be the commander one moment, a member of the pact helping defeat The Mouth of Mordremoth in another moment, the friend of the Commander joining in his adventures another moment, or a member of a band of mercenaries in a raid the next.
---
Of course one can just say "It's just game mechanics", but if the setting allows for a better explanation, it's always better to use it.
---
And although I do think the Tyria we get to play is an aggregation of Fractals, I do not think the original Tyria those fractals mirror was one. I think there's a series of original alternate Tyrias with a canon story each, and that it only moves forward in time.
---
I don't disagree with you that it'll probably never happen. All I was disputing was the idea that the files are gone.
---
Also that answer they gave you is total bullcrap, because right now you can't ever experience a huge chunk of the game's story but the story relies on you knowing who was introduced and what happens. I've had a few people start the game with me and when we get to Season 2, they immediately ask who the fuck all these people are and what happened. That little recap thing does not really do its job well.
---
When gw2 launched I wanted to make a Charr Shaman so bad, if they ever add an optional posture that is upright (at least part of the time) I would be so happy
---
If you aren't playing on hard mode then what's the point?
---
Stealth mechanic could be changed with a new spec. Like instead of stealth, gain shadow armor which gives damage reduction, boons and stuff. Shadow arts would be usefull with this. New stealth/shadow armor attacks on weapon skill 1 could be impelemented to give support abilities.
---
Kind of want Ele to get Longbow next to be honest.
---
If you use your karma on skins you won't be able to salvage runes off of it in the future
---
I think mace (main hand, offhand or both) would be a good weapon choice for third expansion. It is not 2h weapon so you can mix it with other 1h allowing you for combo skill. This elite could be called ** Enforcer** and it would sacrifice it's stealth and dps in exchange for being more tanky (with a bit off cc) and being more supportive to his allies. His skillset could be similar (if not same) to shouts, which could enchance his allies and debuff and cc his enemies at the same time. It would be the best to use when both enemy and ally, are in close range to you so you will use these skills to it's fullest potential.
---
Ah my reply about the files was to Caleb, it didn't put your name in the reply for some reason.  Odd, but I agree.  I don't believe Anet would just purge their Living Story Season 1 content.
---
No they're not, this isn't a WoW hunter.  
---
  
---
They're naturalist spiritual types, channeling nature and primal/wild powers. I think GS doesn't exactly fit that, as their most realistic 'class-fantasy' weapons are the bows and axes.   
---
Melee is 100% fit for Rangers.
---
What would people recommend for solo play?
---
 Reaper or Berserker/spellbreaker?
---
 Various Skyscale Models that were not used for the final Skyscale design.
---
Gorrik is the one taking care of all the baby skyscales like 95% of the time, so he's doing more work than we are, really. The commander just drops in once a day to get a new quest, and our skyscale loves us more than it loves Gorrik. &lt;/3
---
The term/archetype ranger was meant for someone who wanders/explores over a wide area, or specifically "ranges over", not because they use a bow; though ranged weaponry are typically in their arsenal as hunting is a common profession amongst people who range.
---
A greatsword makes perfect sense to a ranger.
---
A keepsake for yourself. And eventually, for them as well.

This is amazing!
---
To be honest they more or less released these raids (not timewise but episode wise)  regularly. Since LS3E4 they released new wing every third episode (so any made by Team 1). Newest one is supposed to be released before LS5E1 but I still have my doubts about it, especially since I remember them saying that they were done with W6 but just needed VO. This for some reason took them so much time that it was released with LS4E4.
---
Absolutely, it saddens me to think about BDO. The combat feels absolutely fantastic, its mesmerizing. However everything outside of it is just... no. The insane RNG in everything, how you felt punished by turning your computer off, I could go on and on. 
---
Your note on how the game does nothing to promote social behavior is so true. Grinding together in BDO feels like you're handicapping yourself. Even if both of the players are really efficient grinders you still ended up feeling limited when going as 2.
---
Just do it whenever you'd log onto those characters naturally. No need to make a big chore out of it.
---
I thought it was disappointing that thief has only gotten 2H weapons for their elite specs when they have a unique mechanic regarding 1H weapons that hasn’t been expanded upon since GW2 launched.
---
Solo play as in open world? Reaper is a lot easier to play solo, so there's definitely that
---
Do you know how to reproduce this because I would be glad to not see infusions.
---
My bad. Linux was released in 91 and is open source. I bet github is the only place to share code.
---
I like the frequent landing. It makes me feel like this is a creature I have to pay attention to the needs of. He can fly around a bit, but often he needs to stop for a second to rest his wings so we can fly higher again.
---
Sure, man. Can’t remember the numbers for my acc yet, but I’ll chuck you an add when I get home. I’m from Norway :)
---
Its a joke, I thought the sheer absurdity of the statement would speak for itself.
---
It's random. Happens in busy areas. But again, this only happens to subtle infusions and not the actual big annoying ones which is what is shocking to me.
---
Yes!!!
---
As far as I can tell it depends on Animations and Effect LoD.
---
It also affects similar particle effects like the particles that appear around the character when picking a personality choice in a dialog. 
---
I had to raise animations to max to make it visible while zoomed out while effect LoD was enabled.
---
But it doesn't work on all infusions. Just in some of them.
---
So what do I do at this point? Do the dailies available to me and sell stuff on the AH to then convert to gems so that I can buy the living seasons 3 and 4? And then if I really enjoy the game drop actual $ on the expansions? I tried the LFG for a couple level 75-80 dungeons but didn't see any groups available ... am I missing something?
---
Golden Kamuy level of facial expressions.
---
I love this game, but some of the animations in it are so damn awkward looking. Who thought that looked cool?
---
thief needs a 1 hand elite weapon. Thief is all about skill 3 changing with dual wielding.
---
I'd say this is a good thing and I hope it'll someday turn up as a slider in the options menu so we can finally see the champs we're fighting again :D
---
Same here, either that or a new weapon type (polearm/scythe).
---
I want greatsword as a core weapon, not as an elite specialization weapon.
---
ele do have fiery greatsword already, there is no point for another one
---
That would be incredible. Consider me sold, this is my dream thief elite specialization now.
---
There are a lot of channels dedicated to stealing twitch content and they make big money.
---
No, just don't, it's not a thing, it's not funny, just turn yourself in, this lazy attempt at meming is criminal and should not be endorsed :c
---
With the current model and the reused skeleton, I have trouble differentiating skyscales from the griffons at a glance. I think they should've gone with something substantially different, like that bat-spider hybrid concept art, or at least the crystalline variant.
---
Not what I asked, but thanks anyway.
---
Damn son this looks so fckn good.... pejnt is a beast o9
---
How about DPS wise?
---
Pejntboks art is best art &lt;3 finally some good shit!
---
Post are getting so lazy nowadays, no one puts in any effort any more :'(
---
You really think someone would do that, just rip out others' content and repost to own channel?
---
You mean „not yet used“ models. I‘m sure they will reuse some of the designs in one way or another as gemstore skins.
---
Reaper has a lot of self-buffing, so its solo dps is actually really strong.
---
Wait, exordiums a great sword? I thought it was a regular sword...
---
So now we have 4 legendary greats words and only 1 sword?
---
Coolio, ta.
---
So... Confidence?
---
Didn't even know of this bug because I knew this guy was getting my sausage ahead of time.
---
Do an achievement in one sitting without giving up.
---
You are so good with the springer, lol. Those same routes would've definitely taken me longer.
---
I hated the currency grind for skyscale but now that I've finally gotten it and done some test flying with all masteries I have to say I really like it. It's much easier to drive than a springer and not having to constantly switch mounts is great. I'm sure it'll get better as my ability to control it improves, too. It was the same with griffon and beetle.
---
I do think its wall grab can be finessed though. And skill 1 seems only usable when you have all four feet on the ground, which feels clunky to me (compare engaging combat from the air on springer/griffon). Plus you can't really aim it very well. I'd love to see it changed to an aoe target with maybe a 450 range cast, dropping you to the ground when it fires.
---
Other than that though, it's a fun mount and definitely has its uses. Also the little fire belch idle animation is cute.
---
Yeaa I kinda wish the desert king was more like this instead
---
No worries! Thanks for the info!
---
just out of curiosity, is there any brand crystal lump or spike near the circle?
---
Yes I realized later or was more time gated..
---
People complaining about time gating then bashing on a speed run...lol 
---
Logic...
---
You made this?
---
Thanks much
---
infusions got weird. i'd very much vote for an effects setting similar to the one we have for unique sounds... but my ember infusion showing up on other's screen with no glowing eyes... or even weirder, just one glowing eye seems a little unfair considering their market price.
---
I haven't even started... I'm two days off finishing my first legendary, so that takes priority. At least the LS4 maps are all super busy so I have people to squad up with!
---
Relax, its a stupid joke that I made last at night while drinking. and thought a few people might get a kick out of it
---
Oh, well I'm blind apparently lmao
---
Is there another sale coming up for the expansions again(my friends told me i missed the 50% off sale)? And whats the current consensus on necro/ Reaper for noobie? Thanks
---
Lmao yeah I spent about 3 hours on the damn thing, kept getting stuck on the last tiny bit of it and eventually a very kind mesmer ported me from the last checkpoint.
---
&gt; no other MMO comes close
---
Lmao? Is this a joke?
---
This is the first character I have seen on this subreddit that actually looks good
---
I still want a Jora elite spec with a greatsword. Shouts and stances for the skills and a mist-infused transformation for the elite. I'd imagine if we go to Cantha or even the battle isles in the next expansion it would be a Canthan legend-- which is where things get weird. 
---
The obvious choices here would have been Togo and Vizu, but Vizu is an assassin like Shiro and Togo is a Ritualist which would overlap with the Kalla skills too much.  The next choices are equally weird. Archemorus is a spear user, so while that could in theory happen, it's unlikely we'll get a spear on land even with Rev. We don't actually know what weapon Saint Viktor used iirc, so it's possible they say he used a greatsword and call it a day.  
---
I think the most likely option would be a newly created character, Canthan origin, that used a greatsword (possibly even Belinda's greatsword in particular) with some GW1 themed skills like a Ritualist weapon skill and one or two of the Kurzick/Luxon skills. The other option would be to use Saint Viktor and retcon him to use a greatsword, but I feel it's much less likely.
---
Whew, the entitlement here is deafening.
---
A large chunk of the material cost is trophies, mithril and elder wood. 
---
You can get them all in fairly high quantities by farming the LS4 maps - use volatile magic to buy trophy shipments (depending on the weapon, you might be able to sell your T5s which will refund some of the cost or potentially make a profit), open and salvage any unidentified gear. 
---
Now is actually a pretty good time to start, as the maps are all fairly active due to their importance in getting the skyscale. 
---
GW2efficiency is a really useful website for checking what you need - I found that it was astronomically more cost effective to go out and get the mats through playing metas and dailies than buying it all and there's something reassuring about watching it get cheaper every day as it shows that you're progressing.
---
Do you even know where the berries are? I will personally hold your hand in-game and direct you to the berries and I promise you they'll be there.
---
I've never had a male warrior or guardian for this exact reason. Such a shame
---
Did the mother die in battle like a true Blood Legionnaire?
---
Thanks xD
---
I dunno, they all look high to me
---
I want to pitch in and comment on the Skimmer part. According to the research done, average speed of the airborne Skyscale is 690 u/ s using one dash whenever the second endurance bar is full. Meanwhile the Skimmer maintains 826 u/ s while above water without using its ability. So unless you can cross a body of water with two to three dashes of the Skyscale, the Skimmer is the mount to go as long as you care for the speed.
---
Otherwise good writeup!
---
Well, it’s all one server now really... a mega sever. Definitely pick up the expansions when you are able, as they are a huge improvement on the vanilla game.
---
&gt;DLGamer
---
I just edited me post asking about engineer and deadeye...are they pretty decent for ranged dps options? Engineer just seemed a little weird when i used a boost on him from one of my birthday gifts for not playing for a while
---
You think about gw2 skill icons when drinking?
---
that argument is simply wrong. people choose to ignore all the scenery, you can easily choose to fly a metre or less above the ground and view it all. the fact is it still happens in GW2 with the raptor and jackal. if you are just looking to get from one place to the other then you are not gonna pay much attention to anything other than obstacles and direction whether you are flying or running, especially considering how big some of the new maps are to make up for having mounts. with the waypoints you don't even have to worry about obstacles or anything, most of them are close to anything you would need to go to and you don't need to take much more than a few steps if you have map completion, which a lot of people do. taking the flight out of flying mounts just makes them feel you've clipped their wings, it's not that fun and the argument in support of it is flawed.
---
What would those skills be? They have racial skills like every other race.
---
It's mount ability 1, just like on other mounts.
---
Part of me hopes that the next time we see Gorrik in some impromptu lab, Blish's golem body is stationed in the lab in some sort of memorial case.
---
Part of me is also disappointed they didn't bring him back, but I guess they ruined the value of death enough by bringing Aurene back within 5 minutes.
---
I'm kinda in the same boat as OP, I have a lvl 80 Charr but it's been so long since I played I forgot where I left off and where I was in the story. I'm debating on just rerolling. I bought the expansions too.
---
I marathoned S4 cuz I got the expacs last December. I had better things to do than grind for shit I didn’t know I needed.
---
Just to give you a boost of confidence, I was really scared to try Xera before my group ran it because I hadn't gotten the flying skill and they had built it up. It's really not that bad at all. It's like two mini games, dps, jumping puzzle, dps, maybe you get ported for one last mini game, dps and win (plus press a button at a specific time if you get chosen). You can do it!
---
[DOLPHINES!!](http://i.imgur.com/IJgJqhf.jpg)
---
I was talking about the dev having unlocked the Skyscale.
---
I myself am about a 3 days off on finishing the collection(s) because I was on a holiday xD
---
It’s a problem for those of us who marathoned the season tho.
---
Right now yes. Hopefully in a few weeks time people are still there. :D
---
But... why?
---
also; 5 days ago. that's either fortunate timing; or not a very long break.
---
I didnt say anything about grind. were you not interested at all in the maps and the events/rewards/achievements?
---
It's not only the timegate. Players also complain that they need to spend season 4 map currencies, that the skyscale has too many collections, that they have to spend gold, that they have to craft something, ...
---
Gw2 Players are only complaining.
---
I'm not going to be able to get it for a few weeks, and not everyone plays every day. I think we'll be fine for a bit.
---
Nope. I planned on doing that shit after the season.
---
Never understood gw2’s social system. Why isn’t there a “allow follower”option ? Why is the most basic “friend request” feature not even a thing? At very least give us a notification whenever someone added you as friend? Not to mention the useless invisible status, the block list that’s almost meaningless. These issues have been floating around since launch, yet Anet does nothing for how long? 7 years?
---
They do tell you the pact is assaulting kralks body as we are cutting it off from the leylines in the story mission. It is also said in that same mission the pact kills kralks body but he still alive deep inside or something like that.
---
Those and all those ledges with just a slight overhang that the springer bumps his head on.
---
just for reference: a full set of light berserker armor currently costs less than 12g straight from the trading post, that's less than a week worth of simply doing your dailies.
---
gearing characters in adequate gear is cheaper than ever, and acquiring gold has become a lot easier over the years as well.
---
and there are other ways to acquire gear as well. e.g. just unlocking reaper will throw an exotic stat selectable greatsword at you.
---
25k = 100 stacks. You can put that into the bags of literally any character, since you start with 5 bag slots.
---
Lol was not expecting such a kind and helpful reply but this community never ceases to amaze me, guess that's the reason I am back.
---
My account name is NGoHT.8195 and I really appreciate it! 
---
I have a total of like 4g on my account yet (just got back and starting from scratch) so obviously farming wasn't my main goal/activity yet :P
---
But still the one with higher level will be slightly stronger.
---
Hey ANET, Rev GS time yet?
---
What’s cool about Exordium is that those are all meta builds too.
---
Nice name &gt;_&gt;
---
Outfit isnt too bad either tbh
---
Oh wait shit I had it in one of my invisible bags... Rip 10g
---
Try disabling/enabling the conditional mount movement option. It's last one in general options.
---
There's a rumour floating around that a long list of friends, blocked players, or followers can add to FPS drops.
---
Goodluck! Sadly there are no dagger or warhorn leggies to match my necro so I have other priorities
---
Make that the ULT. I mean, there's already some similar stuff going on with the shortbow.
---
They fixed that a while ago, and it was only for when you opened the specific window (not very noticeable anyway).
---
May i ask you what dyes and armor you use ?
---
Female asura rangers have the best animations all around, from memory.
---
I bet that Caithe being branded will have some story significance in the future beyond allowing Aurene to speak for one episode. She said that she can still "feel" Aurene at the end so maybe we will use Caithe to find Aurene in the future.
---
Awesome !
---
Let's ask Malyck what he thinks about such beliefs
---
A weapon swap would be unfair in pvp as far as I understand it. But I completely agree with the range point. I think that the best way to fix it would be to rework the element kits, so that a single weapon would have a melee and a ranged element, or rework the conjured weapons to be a bit more useful. Maybe they could make it so that you always have one of the conjured weapons (made more useful) on swap, but you can have only one.
---
Tangled Depth cough\* cough\*   
---
.
---
\*COUGH INTENSIFIES\*
---
Oh, OHHHH
---
I think the guy assumes that "ranger" means "guy who does ranged combat"
---
I'd love to dig Balth's sword out and power it up as part of a collection but they already put it ingame as a skin. Missed opportunity imo.
---
So difficult content can't exist because it's mean and climate change exists. All content needs to be trivial so failure is impossible and everyone is fluffy and nice. Because safespace is important.
---
They're used to complete a portion of that collection based on what map you're on. If there is nothing left to complete on that map for that collection, nothing happens.
---
Can't tell if this is /s or not but yeah outfits are just lazy.
---
You mean transformations? Tbh most of the racial skills are useless anyway. Sylvari has invuln on the other hand.
---
The [Guild Chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE1C9t8dHIA&amp;t=32m42s) on May 17th explained it. 
---
The short version is that a) Aurene already spoke in All or Nothing (overlaid with Caithe's voice) (this is at the 30 minute mark of the Guild Chat youtube video)
---
b) They wanted Aurene to speak at some point, likely waiting until after her ascension, but gameplay made it so that it had to happen earlier since Caithe wouldn't be with the PC during long stretches of the story instances.
---
Don't forget about the stone age mail system where you can only keep up to 15 mails from players.
---
And trying to send more than 2 mails gets you blocked for spam, even if one of those two attempts didn't even include a recipient.
---
Yeah I'd love for thief to get something that actually uses the class's dual wield mechanic.
---
since by the events of episode 6 we already have an "order of the crystal bloom" as new faction, i think it's pretty safe to assume that it will indeed bear some more significance.
---
Tp flipping is still a thing
---
Girl, they abandonded Caithe being the vessel for Aurene to talk through within 1 episode. This is simply retarded.
---
That’s what I’m doing.
---
By Default it should be the V key, same as dodging.
---
To the player, not his enemies.
---
inc 2000 gem skins
---
I think the point of branding Caithe was to show that no matter how else you slice it, Aurene is still a descendant of and likely future elder dragon. Canach served as a foil to that point; to remind everyone that this is a power greater than they could control and a potential danger to the world.
---
Though a good bit happened off camera, we also got some follow up with the Dragonfall map and the new Crystal Bloom Knights. A new faction loyal and dedicated to Aurene (a potential elder dragon). The emphasis on Caithe's branding was that it was a "bond" not "corruption" and this is reflected in the CBKs voluntarily joining up. We also see Caithe retaining her free will and expressing doubts and concerns.
---
There's also, as you mentioned, the visual elements of selling Aurene's death at the end of LS4E5. Caithe's branding was highly symbolic within that immediate span of the story.
---
*Current story spoilers below if you care:*
---
[Dragonfall Spoilers](#s "I think that the branding is a seed being planted for the future of the story. It serves as a point of reference. From here, we can mark the start of Aurene's ascension. If she becomes a corrupted elder dragon, we can point back to Caithe (who would likely be one of her champions) as being the first of her corrupted. If she proves to be a benevolent force, we can point back to Caithe as being a sign that Aurene's 'branding' was different. Alternatively, the world can turn on the commander and Caithe claiming they're minions of the elder dragons and seeking to destroy the world to give their dragon more power.")
---
Just a few examples.
---
I agree with the overall notion that within the scope of the past two episodes Caithe's branding has felt like a very understated / underrepresented story aspect. It happened suddenly and then was left to sit. Maybe Anet originally had more plans for it which had to get cut or maybe it was meant to be this way. It feels like a lot of wasted potential.
---
To be fair, they never said we won't ever get an expansion
---
Torch. It's the only offhand with condi damage. You don't necessarily need 2 though, if you don't want to be efficient. You can just slot scepter into your main hand and torch into your swap offhand set, if you hand to proc the geomancy sigil.
---
I think a variation of a "Samurai" class for Thief is a bit of an obvious direction! Especially if we explore Cantha or have a story that involves people from there, somehow. 
---
*(Before posting, as I always do, I researched into this and saw the debate between people for and against Cantha in order to understand the Community's view on this possibility. Personally, I would love to see some future areas with a "less-human" focus like places further North but I still think Cantha is a wise decision at some point. I think Guild Wars 2 presents an opportunity for the devs to* ***re-approach*** *Cantha; taking the time gap between the series into consideration and presenting us a realized world that feels distinct from the rest of Tyria, and feels less like a "stereotype-island".*  
---
&gt; *Not to mention, having us travel by sea and possibly get in battles with Canthans puts us in a good position for Bubbles/S....? Elder Dragon being introduced and if I may dream, better underwater battles/underwater mounts!)*  
---
&gt;Also - **"The Sunken Cities of Cantha"** \- What if the elder dragon completely changed that whole environment? Throwing their country into turmoil and sinking major cities. Insert "Canthan faction that supports the Dragon" here to fight the main characters. 
---
Anyway, back to Thief/Samurai -- I would prefer it if Thief got something that felt different than a stealth/burst spec. I'm not sure if the Daredevil is considered the "tanky" thief spec but I hope if Greatswords do find their way to Thief, that it would be some sort of precise/tankier paced spec. Maybe something like Elementalist where they can go into different "postures/positions" to access different skills. Or just a class with more cleave and synergy with underused Thief utility skills? Personally, I'd love something with more team support!
---
Rigging Caithe to hug the Commander for dear life on Aurene required too much effort.
---
Fam, you say that like they will never bring it back through some other way like long distance communication w/o technology created by Deus ex Taimi.
---
Aurene already spoke in episode 5. 
---
*I am not him*
---
Why does everyone like the greatsword so much? Im a warrior and hate using it
---
Babe, I am still impressed by how they managed Malyck. Properly executed deadend :)))))))
---
Yeah, carrying those bulky max size norns and charrs is hard work.
---
Child, only players who were any bit invested in 1 race ever learned who Malyck was. Who cares? :))))))))))))))))

Newer maps? Yes. Old maps? No, the textures are very low resolution and "washed".

Can we get Gwen instead? Her conversations with Rytlock would be great fun.

Glorious.  No worries, I'll keep checking.  Thank you!

You did a very poor job of hiding the fact that you posted this just to stir up drama

A charr being an actual parent? Hah!

You wound me sir/madam.im very curious what kind of unlock requirements ppl would genuinely enjoy.

I think the next complaint will be if Anet doesn’t make a a griffin skin for the skyscale.

Guild need a guild-wide mail system badly. Hell, anyone trying to organize an event needs it.

I wanna see some offhand weapons in the mainhand. I wanna see Focus/Focus Thief and have them bring back Touch skills from GW1.
---
Not too sure about Exordium or Twilight, but been attempting to make my first legendary Astralaria for months now, so close to finishing it. Mostly working on masteries to finally finish this damn axe.
---
What is dead may never die. I wanna know what kinda content the playerbase would like for the next big thing we gotta unlock
---
I’m actually more confused now than I started :(
---
Maybe elder dragons develop how to speak as they age. How did the other elder dragons learn how to communicate after all.
---
ooh.. oh wrong fox
---
Thank you so much for your interest! Hopefully it's just a matter of a few days :)
---
To be fair, so does Dragon Stand if you open all the noxious pods after the meta
---
Yes this is the solution run your browser through a proxy but not your games
---
Especially as one would think that coming back to life taking its toll on the power she can bring up. But she went right back in stronger than before. It is just a poorly written story in my opinion.
---
"Defeating a sandwich only makes it tastier."

You can, it's just complex and not what op needs

&gt; What is dead may never die.

Ok, Theon.

&gt; I wanna know what kinda content the playerbase would like for the next big thing we gotta unlock

I’d recommend you make a post directly about that rather than the passive aggressive style you went with here.
---
Beautiful, but depressing af. Nice work!
---
Those dolphins will occasionally give you a special version of Swiftness that works on your mount, too.
---
It's very noticeable when it happens, cause you end up losing the slippery physics of the Skimmer during the effect.
---
He drank last night and now thinks the icon is making the dab pose when in reality the thing pointing up is a greatsword.
---
There's a lot of guilds. If you want a chill one, your best bet will likely be one of the PvX guilds, they advertise in map chat every once in a while. Alternatively, if you send me a dm I could ask an officer invite you into one I know is pretty good.
---
Confusion is mostly useless in pve so your main focus should be on burning, bleeding and torment (so take torch and scepter related traits). Null field is worthless in majority of situations while feedback is better when used for actual reflection.
---
Condi mesmer gets a lot of stats from signets of domination and midnight. The rest of the skills are generally better from mirage than core mesmer, especially elite and heal.
---
I'd suggest starting fights with your ranged skills (which have pretty good burst) - pistol 4, scepter 3+ambush, torch 5 and if target survives, go in with torch 4 and axe 3+2+ambush. In case you need more aoe, swap your scepter+pistol for staff.
---
kinda, as long as you're able to respond to GMs messages
---
What would the point of free accounts be?
---
Technically 4 categories.
---
1) Bags of gear/bags of masterwork gear - open on low level bag alt.
---
2) unidentified gear (not actually a bag but digressing) - always treated as opening on level 80 since that gear is rolled when you acquire the unid gear
---
3) caches which are the bags that state "affected by magic find"; these act as if you were to kill a mob of the same type (ie: mushroom cache will give you loot as if you rolled loot by killing a mushroom)
---
4) champion bags- these're things that have orange outlines like gilded strongbox, heirloom seedpouch; as per their name, dropped by champions. these you CAN open on a low level bag alt but because they're of the champion level you're still better off opening these on your 80's for greater chances of exotics and because their fine crafting materials will always be tier 5 no matter what
---
Channel balthazar?
---
I fully agree except your last point. I absolutely loved that flying into a creature that feeds off of magic you see this beautiful, unquantifiable twisting nether. Tbh my favourite part of the story
---
It's okay in the sense that you're not using any scripts or anything that makes you do more than one action with a key.
---
And you also have to be only "semi afk", meaning that if a dev happens to notice you and PM's you, you'd need to be able to reply.
---
And it's not like it's that wild, either. Glint talked. If anything it was more strange that Aurene *hadn't*, until now.
---
I've been playing games with a goal-oriented mindset since Modern Warfare 2/Halo 3. Had to get above a 2.0 K/D ratio, had to get a 50 in a ranked playlist. Every death, every loss was step backwards and it would really get to me, really cause me to tilt.
---
As I've grown older, I have realized the importance of focusing on you and only you as a player. Each engagement, that is where your focus should be. Not on the win, not on the loss, not on your team, but on how you handle your engagments death-by-death. 
---
It takes time to train your mind to appreciate each moment in a match and to not have your mind wander to the end screen. Practice though, hone your focus on each engagement. And once a game is behind you, it is behind you. Know that after a loss, you at the very least have more practice under your belt than you did before.
---
Remember, the master has failed more times than the beginner has even tried.

Unless she's a Saiyan and gets more powerful every time she is defeated...
---
Ahhh this brings me back to GW1.
---
&gt;I'll go create several free accounts and join in
---
Go for it. Have fun levelling multiple F2P accounts to level 80 and actually making a profit. Sounds pretty bad to me but if that's what you wanna do.
---
You can have many, many games open at the same time.
---
Same thing happened when i was crafting twilight 4 months ago. Got lucky cause a group did the event and i just went with them
---
In regards to those paths, it seems he willed it to be that way so his granddaughter could finish what needed to be done.
---
Rerolling is definitely a great way to relearn the game and its mechanics, because depending how long ago you played some of the mechanics may have changed. 
---
I've always enjoyed the leveling process, so I definitely think it's a great way to reintroduce yourself to the game. But dont delete your old character, they still have valuable birthday gifts.
---
Grab 'em by the ears!

There is also always /r/guildrecruitment
---
I-It’s not like I wanted to eat you or anything.
---
Wow! Thanks for this Guide Dude! The work is appreciated!
---
Also the Tekkit-Taco overlay is nice.
---
Just a quick question about that. I can see the markers ingame  but they are not on the map (pressing M) or on the minimap (like this [Tekkit Map](http://tekkitsworkshop.net/images/map_skyscale_scales_fever_eggs.jpg)) - is that normal or am I just unable to use it correctly? :P
---
Cheers!
---
apparently next up is another season, not an expac
---
First, don't be afraid to contact support - they can also help you troubleshoot.
---
Second, reset your router and use the -repair [Command Line Argument](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Command_line_arguments) on GW2.  After that, try using the -clientport 443 Command Line Argument to bypass any port throttling.
---
Also, try switching to a different connection if possible:  from wireless to wired (or vice versa), a different port on your computer, or even another network if possible.
---
Has this happened as long as you've been playing GW2, or is it a new issue?  Does it only happen during certain content, or anywhere in-game?
---
This is a collector mail, you should definitely keep it forever.
---
Is this based off of some famous painting or something? I'm getting some serious stylistic deja vu here.
---
I would like to see the banter of Gwen and Rytlock and just Gwen being a doting great great granny towards Logan
---
I had no intention of implying I didn’t enjoy it. It was a great spectacle to be sure.  I just don’t understand how his insides were bigger than his outsides and that’s where my confusion with the instance design is.
---
There are encounters (mostly in Raids) where a dagger can be used. But only bc it is a option to send condis from you to the enemy. Usefull on sabetha when you can stay in fire feelds and gather some burning stacks on yourselfe. 
---
But this are exceptions and mostly useless in open world or fractals. 
---
The only real option for a condi build is a torch offhand. Depending on what build you run (main epi or back epi) you play with two torches and a weapon swap sigil or just with one torch and ignore the second weapon set completely. 
---
Also this is just the Meta build. If you just wanna have fun in open world you can play whatever floats your boat.
---
If only classes can have different skills like a guardian can have warrior skills.
---
That would be a really awesome way to combine your builds. :)
---
True. Looking at my guard is like staring straight into the sun with how fucking bright he is haha.
---
I thought it's 10 mails you can get?
---
PvE enemies don't use enough skills-per-second to get the confusion damage you want.
---
Guild Wars 2 is more CPU dependent than GPU,  That laptop looks like it'd be able to handle the game pretty easily though. There are some situations where even higher end computers will have issues and that's just because of the optimization of the game. But you shouldn't have much of a problem
---
since this wasn't linked yet https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/categories/arenanet-guild-wars-2-policies
---
why would you need an "allow follower option" ? It doesnt hurt you in any way, also blocking does what it is for, blocking people from contacting you, only the "cheat" to get the name of an enemy player in wvw with it is kinda dumb
---
Other poster is saying confusion is useless because confusion got nerfed badly in PvE as it now does more damage based on the enemy using skills where as before it did more damage as a passive. A ton of PvE enemies use skills so little or infrequently that the confusion just does not do a ton of damage. 
---
So for your build though you're fine. Axe/Pistol is great for PvE. Torch is recommended but I prefer pistol as my primary for the CC. This is the build I run https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Mirage_-_Condi_DPS_Chaos_(Fractal) In open world I run Axe/Pistol + Greatsword for mob tagging. Switch greatsword for staff when doing bosses but can also run scepter/torch which I keep on me and swap around.
---
So in your opinion it's not worth looking at a more expensive one ? E.T. one with a 2070 or 2080 and 32gb ram ? Or high Ghz CPU ?
---
The first half of the collection is just getting the same item over and over again. It’s not content, it’s padding. Of course you can’t do that shit in a day but you shouldn’t have to get 21 of everything.
---
&gt; Why isn’t there an “allow follower”option ?
---
As someone with a long list of followers, please no. It would be very frustrating to have to accept/decline so many of them. There is literally no consequence whatsoever to have someone on your followers list unless you for some reason do not want them to see if you're online. The invisible status is useless though, I will give you that.
---
The most important factor for running GW2 well is [CPU Single Thread Performance](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/singleThread.html) (the higher on that list, the better).  The laptop you're considering appears to have an i7-8750H CPU, which is pretty good (2356 vs 2901 top benchmark).
---
The GPU (RTX 2060) is overkill for GW2, especially since this laptop only has a 1920x1080 screen.  If you plan on plugging it into a higher resolution monitor, then this GPU would be more appropriate.
---
Finally, 16GB of RAM is enough and 2667MHz is pretty good, but 3000Mhz would probably be a better match for the other components.
---
Once you do have a new laptop, try playing with the [DirectX12 Wrapper](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bkk2lf/d912pxy_dx12_for_gw2_new_beta_v099/).  YMMV, but other players found this helps smooth out/increase FPS.
---
Just like Caladbolg.
---
Thank you!

---
I wasn't sure what to make of this until WoodenPotatoes talked about it in his War Eternal video. Think of how the excess magic has caused reality to go haywire in Tyria, now imagine that effect turned up to eleven inside an Elder Dragon.
---
When something consumes *that much* magic, it's not unreasonable to believe that magic will cause unexpected qualities to emerge.
---
A big selling point for what, exactly? PoF is probably the last paid-for expansion. From now on we're just getting slightly bigger LW seasons.
---
I almost gave up at this point too. But when I looked at all the other stuff I did to get there, I figured I might as well finish it. If you have any alts it will go by faster and  because of this collection some maps that were sparsely populated before have more players now so it is possible to do the metas, do the hearts faster and collect the map currency.
---
 I am now around 200 Difluorite Crystals short of finishing. Hang in there it's all down hill from here, once you visit 28 maps for the "Skyscale Flight" achievement .
---
Find your World's voice chat (Discord, TS, etc.).  From there you can find commanders and guilds to play with.

i really dont want an aurene skin. if the lore reasons behind the skins dont actually have to do with mesmer magic, then it just would make even less sense to have an aurene skin. i might actually stop playing if i have to see a million aurenes everywhere i go
---
* LS4 Hearts give bundles of map currencies 
---
* Meta events give 5 daily *per character*
---
* tekkot tacO can grant an extra 30-40 daily *per account*
---
* Home instance nodes give additionals 3
---
* DragonFall Volatile Magic grant extra 5
---
&gt; or in the next episode
---
I would agree, though I was made aware (through WP's video on the episode) that one dev talked about how ANet wasn't sure they'd get another season after this one, so they kinda needed things to have a soft conclusion to the game here.
---
These are pretty much also my feelings on the whole thing. The flight part one annoyed me because it really felt like the saddle was the last thing. This and the lack of proper hints on the sick skyscales and egg collections were my biggest gripes, aside from the time-gate tied to daily reset.
---
2 Minstrel Firebrands are able to solo tank and heal after the split, but you can bring any other support(s) for comfort. You can even skip alacrity, it's not _that_ important.

Jk, but really PvP isn't my best gametype and I usually get demoralized after around 2 or 3 losses.
---
Like Shin Devil Dante?

It is, if you bring a mesmer to portal between the two bosses.
---
I like how you counted four whilist the thread we're posting in lists five skill sets. Medium has one; forgotten Ranger.
---
so aurene is a super sayin?
---
One day before I did!
---
The Reaper hood is so nice I often go years without seeing my Necro’s face.
---
I actually really like this idea. Wouldn't require a ton of resources, either. Just have the opening to the episode, when Caithe calls, have the Commander say *"I see no other way forward. They deserve to know before the end."*
---
You go to whichever leader the game decides is appropriate, break the news, see how they handle it, and then return to embrace the end alongside your friends.
---
It wouldn't be much, but it would both remind us that there are people back home to worry about and give that brief sense of consequences and doom before the inevitable "PSYCH, Aurene's fine" moment. As it currently stands, the world feels awfully small. If they send us home for just a moment, it reminds us just how far we've come and just how big the world we're fighting for is.
---
It's something stupid, don't bother about it.
---
I've had nonstop errors with digital river's payment system, which is what Anet uses. Sometimes, Anet support can help, other times, it's out of their hands. I've had better luck paying with paypal.
---
Ok, that made me laugh.
---
Fact you may not know: if you have an empty mainhand/offhand weapon in one weapon set, it will still use the weapon from the other set if applicable when you swap to that set.
---
The best option for condi scourge is actually scepter/empty and empty/torch. That lets you weapon swap (triggering Sigil of Geomancy) while remaining on the scepter/torch set using only two weapons. You can also run scepter/dagger and empty/torch, which is about the same damage but also allows condi transfer in certain fights. Regardless of offhands, you *always* want one of your mainhand weapons empty, because switching off of scepter is a huge dps loss.
---
Speaking from personal experience: stalkers.
---
Depends on what stats you're using. Ranger is typically good/decent for mob clearing. If you played thief you'd be having a nightmare right now
---
Lmaoooo

Welcome to Order of Whispers. Our goal is to gather information for new adventurers to read and help you on your journey. For starters you should take a look at this, [Orders "list of important things recruits should know"](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/newplayers). We also have weekly questioning session every [Saturday at 1pm UTC](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1pm+UTC+Saturday) where you can get answers to questions you might have.

* [Guides](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/guides)
---
* [Related links](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/links)
---
* [History of changes and Living Story](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/returningplayers)

---
You copied a build that is coupled with food and utilities to max out crit and power. If you are not using them then the damage will be low, also are you using any specific rotations? I can't imagine long bow as dps are you copying a pvp build?
---
I barely touched this map on release so it’s been really nice to go back to them all this week farming.
---
Somewhere, the Wicked Witch of the East is having a really good chuckle.
---
I can live with that.
---
Charr are so ugly 😂

r/outofcontext

GW1 had a serious legibility problem.  So many characters involved in the same fight at the same time all firing abilities nonstop - if you don't have a lot of intimate game knowledge it is not at all clear what is going on.  That seriously hurt its appeal to viewers and would make it difficult to compete as a serious e-sport.
---
It did have good pacing and map movement in high skill matches though.  There isn't anything else like that out there and that gives it an important differentiator.  The legibility issues would demand a substantial visual overhaul, and probably some big differences in balancing philosophy to support it - more differentiation between minor and major abilities.
---
It would honestly need a spiritual sequel (LoL::DotA) to really make it though.  It had some really inspired pieces that I loved (and miss) that nothing else has come close to matching, but there were flaws in the design that you'd want to fix if you were to make it today.
---
I'm making a legendary and was wondering the most efficient ways of getting T6 mats, aside from buying. Thanks!
---
I don't know how I'd feel about an explicitly Aurene skin, either. While it's a no brainier, especially since she's probably got the same skeleton/rigging, it would also be kinda weird to see a bunch of a single main character flying around everywhere, especially since said character is now &gt;!an Elder Dragon.!&lt; What would also be cool and wouldn't be so jarring would be an Aurene-inspired skin or an Aurene-branded skin (especially once LS5 starts up and we start seeing the "minions" she has, if any).
---
Saladbowl at least had some steps to acquire it. Balthazar's sword was just one in an entire set of BL skins...
---
Smokescale?
---
I'm thinking the same thing xD
---
It needed a beat. Aurene should have been a surprise, not something that happened in the first ten minutes. 
---
If they carried on, weary and terrified, using some magic science Asura/Exalted/Mursaat/Whatever nonsense to chase down Kralk, failed horribly and almost died and then Aurene flew in in some quiet, sad moment, it would have been a surprise. There was no twist in the tale. There was no buildup.
---
It depends on whether you're power or condi but as you get a damage buff when you cc an enemy, you DO want stuns.
---
XD
---
Incorrect, no one ripped out a Guild Chat video to get views.
---
If you follow our Youtube Channel we have Guild Wars 2 Game Development playlist, for those that are interested in what went into making  Guild Wars 2.  Not everyone have 2 hours to listen to an entire stream.  The video that was uploaded was 8 mins.  8 minutes is absolutely nothing compared to the 2 hour video.

I was surprised we didn't get anything about him in the last episode

The mushroom casually walking away with his ass on fire
---
gotta say, I was not expecting that.
---
What do you mean?
---
The post was meant to show the different models that Skyscale fans may have missed because not everyone has 2 hours to watch a livestream video.
---
Agreed what you linked reminds me of the Nian monsters in Guild Wars 1.
---
https://wiki.guildwars.com/images/thumb/8/8e/Nian.jpg/800px-Nian.jpg
---
I agree. I doubt they scrapped it solely because of arachnophobia. They probably found in testing that it wasn't super exciting in its current iteration, or had trouble implementing all the features they wanted, or just thought the other mounts were cooler.
---
Still better ending than GoT season 8.

Anywhere in LS4 that throws a lot of enemies at you is good for VM. 
---
Dragonfall and Istan are both easy sources of VM, with *much* more if you use map currency, which drops in higher volumes than the other maps. 
---
The Specimen Chamber in Sandswept Isles is really good because it literally has wave after wave of enemies for 5 minutes and you can just bomb them all with AoE damage and then move onto the next group.
---
Thunderhead Peaks' two meta events both chuck a lot of enemies at you and there is a really easy skimmer VM trail that starts by the dredge village that you can follow that gives you a good amount for the time. It has another VM trail that involves flight, but it's harder to hit them all and a bit hard to get to the start. Branded drop radiant dust, which sells reasonably well so this is also a good gold-generation zone.
---
I am not as familiar with the other two maps yet... volatile magic is quite easy to farm if you put your mind to it.
---
Thanks! Take a look!
---
It would run it really well.  I have a laptop with a CPU scoring 1900 and a tower with a CPU scoring 2700 on that benchmark.  My laptop struggles to maintain 60fps, while my tower consistently stays above that.
---
In 1080p, anything above a GTX 1660/1660Ti would be overkill, especially for GW2.
---
This laptop seems like a pretty good fit, but if you could find something with a better CPU+RAM speed but a lesser GPU for the same price, then that would be a better fit for GW2.
---
Everything is still very active: Raids, Fractals, and open world content. Even dungeons can usually get an lfg going. They also do events now that look back at old content. HoT Metas and new metas are still regularly run, but even core stuff is getting a look in now and then.
---
There are also several new fractals, and they are good.
---
Your build looks more versatile as it's more survivable and disable proof. And the added condition damage and duration makes up for whatever benefit one might get from illusion. BTW can you use shatters reactively when you are disabled or does it have to be proactive to have any effect?
---
I initially tried chaos inspiration but didn't find the healing all that great and the damage wasn't great either, then I remembered how I was really into combo fields before I stopped playing and remembered using feedback and null field and tried to make a confusion heavy build.
---
Asking in WvW is probably the fastest way, but often Googling it also works.
---
Oh. Because colors. I was confused for a bit.
---
Or models added to the next adption liscence.

Hopefully though we'll get some "exotic mount packs" themed to the same sets we have for raptor, griffon, etc.

Edit your post and add it, it will be much easier ^^
---
Thats weird thought because I think lets say someone has gw2 base game then buys path of fire thats 2 new maps but season 4 comes with 6 new maps? do you think there'll b another expanison soon
---
I just did, thanks :)
---
How is a feathered catbird at all similar to a scaled winged lizard?
---
Honestly, I could easily picture you or others complaining the skyscale was too similar to branded griffon if they used the crystalline version if feathers are too similar to scales.
---
Can you skip seasons like lets say buy season 4 but not buy season 1 and 2
---
You can skip story releases in any order. Core game, HoT, PoF, and each Living World episode are separate story chunks that can be started independently with no need to have played past story bits.
---
God I'd love that. I chose an Asura at launch for that reason, was disappointed when I found out racial elites were just for flavor
---
Here is my recommendation. 
---
Power and Condi classes are both super viable and super fun to play. Power classes tend to be burstier, while condi classes tend to spread their damage out over a longer period of time and bring sustained damage. The one you prefer is totally up to you and what you enjoy. For example, I love playing power on my berserker (warrior), but condi on my weaver (elementalist). Depending on the class and spec you play, you may enjoy one damage type over the other. Also, some specializations might not be super effective with a damage type. For example, condition deadeye is just directly worse than condi core thief and condi daredevil.
---
If you are planning to play ranger, guardian or necro for the open world, here are my suggestions for builds.
---
Ranger:
---
Core ranger - power ranger and condi ranger are both viable for this. Power ranger brings good burst and long range damage, while condi ranger brings good sustained damage and lots of aoe damage. Choose the one you want based purely off the skills you like.
---
Druid: don't play this in the open world especially solo
---
Soulbeast - soulbeast is just a core ranger upgraded with some bonus features so the same rules apply. However, you might want to choose your damage type based on the pet you like too as some pets are better for power and some are better for condi.
---
Guardian:
---
Base guardian - don't play this since both specs are pretty much a direct upgrade for the open world. You can play this however, if you really want as its not bad, but its not that good either.
---
Dragonhunter - Dragonhunter shines purely with power, as its burst is massive with greatsword and traps. The longbow you gain from the specialization is fantastic and brings a super potent ranged option that condi dragonhunter just cant match.
---
Firebrand - Firebrand is ok with power but really excels with condi. With renewed justice ( a trait in the radiance line), your tome of justice resets everytime you kill a mob without it equipped giving you massive amounts of burning damage and a lot of aoe as well.
---
Necro:
---
Core necro: sucks
---
Reaper: condi reaper exists, but power reaper is much more fun. Greatsword, and axe are your go to weapons on power reaper and let you hit massive crits while having the bonus life from your reaper's shroud. You also bring lots of aoe with wells, fantastic sustain from built in healing and aggro spreading from any minions you choose to equip.
---
Scourge - scourge has both power and condi variants, but the spec was designed for condis. You can apply massive amounts of aoe condis incredibly easily as a scourge making condi the go to choice for scourge. 
---
If there are other classes you enjoy or want my opinion on, let me know and I'll give you my thoughts on best damage/weapons for the class
---
TLDR: Choose your damage type based on your class/specialization as both are super effective at killing things. Condi is better at killing tankier targets, and power is better with weaker ones. However, power can kill things tanky things very easily and condi can melt trash mobs very easily so don't worry too much on efficient killing and make sure you have fun.
---
Why would they save it if they're never gonna do another expansion?
---
There doesn't even need to have a hard 'failure' to any plan to pull him out of the mists. Even if the story got to the same point as entering dragon's fall, but without Aurene, the commander would then be presented with two conflicting objectives. Prevent Kralk from recovering, but also don't let him die without a replacement. Considering how wounded he appears to be from the first battle, and the ever mounting casualties from the war, that second objective could have been especially tricky and a main tension point of the episode.
---
However I don't know if "using some magic science Asura/Exalted/Mursaat/Whatever nonsense to chase down Kralk" would make good writing :(
---
Does 8 and 9 mean that things like expansions would be banned as well since theyre an add on transaction to a interactive digital entertainment product?
---
Season 5 is starting in the next couple of months. Expansions never interrupt seasons. If Season 5 runs 6 episodes at ~3 months per episode as is the norm for these releases, the earliest I can see Expansion 3 coming is Late 2020/Early 2021.
---
Who said we never get one?
---
that was my thinking, i have however, never bought an experience booster and i have dozens over the years that were freely rewarded by playing normally.
---
You can.

My buddy, after just 2 weeks of playing, got a Dusk drop. Says he spent 35g on unid's, dropped them in the forge. Meanwhile, its been 5 years since my last precursor drop QQ

There are ways to monetize without relying on loot boxes, GW2 and most other games did it for many years. They could offer season passes, optional subscriptions, all kinds of ways to monetize without gambling.

Still, until the republicans are on board with this I'd say it's dead legislation. The republicans have a majority in the Senate and I don't see them working with the dems any time soon.

Yeah, they talk about social design for things like removing kill-stealing and node-stealing from the game, yet their UI is beyond archaic and does nothing to encourage social interaction when it could be doing a world of difference.
---
* Better mail, friend request/rejection, and no creepy-stalkery-non-optional-followers list should be a standard
---
* Status message to convey current mood/situation. e.g. "FINISHED MY FIRST LEGENDARY"
---
* Friends Chat - Fills a space between Whisper and Guild chat and lets people easily tap their whole list for dungeons, raids, story, or casual conversation instead of whispering one-by-one. 
---
* Friend Notes, beyond nickname, that's only visible to you. That's such a normal thing in so many other platforms for helping people keep track of their dozens to hundreds of friends online.

My biggest problem with the writing is the pulling punches. They keep trying to trick the player into thinking people are dead only to bring them back the next episode. The only people that have died are Bram's mother and Scarlet. And I'm not even sure if Scarlet is even dead. It really puts me in a bad mood when they devote so much of the beginning to have, what amounts to a fake funeral for a dragon that has only really been a caricature for half a season.

*I was planning on mainly using a greatsword and possibly something for range as a secondary but not necessary, I've heard Warrior has a lot of condition utility, can I just not use it?*
---
Warrior and guardian both have condition damage options, as well as power options. At the moment, Warrior uses axe + axe, and guardian uses greatsword + scepter and focus for their power options.
---
*And I know this might be a stupid question, but what class is more fun? I don't mind spamming abilities, but I also don't mind at all if I have to pay attention to rotations.*
---
All classes in the endgame will have an optimal rotation. It's good to learn it if you plan on doing organized group content like fractals (5 man) or raids (10 man). As for fun, it's a matter of opinion. Guardian will offload many hard-hitting skills at once, but then do a lot less during their cooldown. Warrior, while it also has a harder-hitting bursty phase, isn't nearly as polarized. The current warrior build requires you to be behind the opponent. The current guardian build requires the opponent to be able to trigger your traps (some stationary object-like opponents do not). 
---
*I'm looking for something that can be viable solo, but also can do dungeons and such stuff without having some meta builds, or too much special/expensive gear to have a viable build*
---
Bad news: Organized group content should not be attempted without meta builds before you are very intimate with the workings of your character, because you will find yourself kicked from parties for poor performance. Customizing your builds to your liking is fine and many people experiment with alternative runes and stat changes, but it's best to learn using what's meta first before you try and do that. 
---
Good news: as far as builds go, the power variants of both builds are very cheap and affordable by buying exotic berserker's gear from the trading post. They use basically the same equipment.
---
I see SAB is leaking again...
---
There are definitely other options to monetize, but I feel like GW2 doesn't really have the userbase to sustainably do that anymore. 
---
Surprisingly, a republican actually created the bill.
---
I kind of think the first mission of this episode should have been the last mission of the last episode.
---
The episode ends with us bringing down the dragon in the middle of the ocean, and the 3 or so months are what it takes to get established on the island--which until then is too toxic (or something) to visit.

Come on now, u/jesselavender's comment was not solely directed at you.  Your post is light hearted and funny, but it does not erase but the huge population that is earnestly whining about having to play the game to get in game rewards.

Tbh what I really want for rev is master Togo spec that let's you have rit spirits not summoned as separate entities but floating above your head flinging shit. Weapon is a scepter or focus.
---
how much do living story costs like $20?
---
&gt; did aurene actually absorbed all the dragon energy when it fall? or is the amount of energy released so vast that she can't absorb it all for herself?
---
We witnessed a massive Bloodstone explosion being absorbed by "Lazarus"/Balthazar. If a god can absorb nuclear levels of magic faster than it can expand, I think a dragon at the core of a dying dragon would be just fine.

does spellbreaker spec of warrior suck at pve?

Gw2 is still one of the top most 5 played MMOs out there. They could easily monetize the living world (800 gems to buy it until the next episode then raise to 1200). They could also do revert back to doing armors and higher quality outfits. I think they have plenty of ways to monetize theyre game at this point they just dont use them. 
---
I'm not saying they wont take a hit if this bill passes, they most likely will but I highly doubt it would cause the financial death of the game.
---
I'm on Troublesome step and I've been pretty fine with the whole thing since they fixed not being able to earn experience. I had 14 quartz crystals, so I had plenty of time to wait for guides and see what could/needed to be done ahead of time. 
---
Saving Skyscales seems like the overall most fun and creative part, so maybe it would've been better if the later parts were for other rewards; I saw someone suggesting that. Anyway, I certainly don't need anyone's head for how things were handled. I remember being more frustrated with the beetle unlocking.
---
And yet you got drops worth way more than the average amount of precoursers people get. :)
---
Thank you for such a detailed answer and explantion! I'll definitely take all that into consideration! Like I answered someone above, this game offers so many options when it comes to customization that I got nervous about stacking stats or building in a way that things just don't synergize very well. Per example: As I progress through the story and do content, I am noticing that more and more enemies have either that bluish green bar underneath their health or a metal one that I assume it's armor. So I had no idea if a power or condition build would be better to deal with those. On top of that, condition seems to stack all the way to two digits, and I don't know if it's worth to build a class with condition damage if I can't make the most out of those stacks at all times.
---
I like to drop model quality to the lowest and up the model limit, helpful in blobs in part to not having to see the glaringly bright dyes some people stack on their armor (dye+infusion combos can be annoying).
---
&gt; It would greatly affect gw2, it would outlaw black lion chests, the random mount liscense and such.
---
I don't see any downsides.
---
&gt; Also gems to gold is an easy p2w argument (getting a legendary can easily be considered an achievement) paying for gems and converting to gold ease getting a legendary.
---
Good, it can go to hell too. Getting rid of the exchange (in both directions) is a small price to pay to rid the industry of mtx bullshit.
---
&gt; Video games have not risen in price
---
And neither they should: microtransactions exist not to prevent devs from going bankrupt or to recoup the development costs, they exist to milk astronomical amount of money out of gullible consumers to give their investors the illusion of infinite growth. If your company cannot exist without public investments (which basically equates to lying to people with money that they'll get even more rich, fast), then you shouldn't be in this business to begin with. If you can't make a game and break AT LEAST even on sales alone, then you either made a bad game or spent way more on development and marketing than it was worth. Not every game has to be a gigantic(ly empty) open world with photorealistic graphics, character customization, tonnes of dull but needlessly voiceacted content, and an advertisement campaign on the scale of second coming of jesus. Get rid of all this, start developing more limited in scope games, and suddenly production costs will go way down.
---
&gt; and this would kill alternative revenue streams in general and not just predatory ones.
---
The only revenue stream that should exist beyond selling the game is selling more content for the game. Content that was developed after the game was released, mind you, no "on-disk DLC" nonsense - you already paid for it, they have no moral right to charge you again for something they'd already sold to you once. In the best case: content that includes gameplay, not just cosmetics. But we're already way past that threshold, at this point even buying non-randomized cosmetics seems like a heck of a good deal. How far down the [fuckhole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_game) has this industry fallen...
---
From a general standpoint, yes, but mainly in end game content like Fractals or Raids (where its an extremely niche pick). In open world anything goes (though it does boost high natural sustain and a fair decent amount of CC, especially since it doesn't need to trade off its heal skill for a DPS increase).
---
Oh using portal stone inside home instance always throws back to tutorial. Need to use door to explicitly exit to city. That's why I mentioned sylvari whose home instance doesn't have interactive (yellow use) door
---
That was Jessica price, who has posted and given a lot of interviews saying some pretty shitty things about Anet in what seems to be a fit of pique.
---
We had the current devs on stream saying they knew there was going to be further development when writing this season, but they didn't know if it would be an expansion or another living story season. I'm more inclined to trust them than I am the dev we've seen explicitly lie about the reason she was forced to leave in interviews.
---
you're in core tyria. you can only select and level it in PoF/LS4 zones
---
you have to be in PoF regions
---
Am I the only one who thought this was a satire headline? That is "Pay-to-win legislation? Wow, they really don't give a fuck about how corrupt they look now."
---
I don't see that as a problem. Addictive games have been there since the beginning. It's when they start trying to get you addicted to spending money that it's a problem.
---
Even with model limit on low it should always display WoD because if the warrior comes too close to you it will get priority and the game will show him. From my knowledge, slow CPUs/HDDs may cause things to not apear at all so, is worth taking a look at these too.
---
Wouldn't be the first time they changed their plans along the way.
---
True, but I've almost never found that to be a problem in my experience. At the most, you might want to be sure the other players get a hit in on an enemy before you kill it, but I think that's only a problem if you're not in a party with them. Even as a level 80 right outside a racial city, you're not necessarily one-shotting everything (you can, but not with auto attacks).
---
Meh no one should’ve expected Aurene to stay dead. No one.
---
&gt; If you can't make a game and break AT LEAST even on sales alone, then you either made a bad game or spent way more on development and marketing than it was worth.

---
This is the key here.
---
Companies keep pretending that developing games in more expensive than ever but anyone with half a clue knows that's pure bullshit.
---
Games have not risen in price, but volume has gone up massively and development costs, ceteris paribus, are the lowest they've ever been thanks to the constant tooling improvement.
---
The ever increasing budget for "AAA" videogames come from ridiculous scopes and/or pants-on-head retarded marketing, and while the games are *flashier* today, I'd argue that they're not better in any way.

A Republican is the one who introduced the outline and helped introduce this bill. " Weeks ago, **Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.)** released [an outline](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/05/senator-hawley-announces-bill-banning-loot-boxes-pay-to-win-mechanics/)  for the The Protecting Children from Abusive Games Act, aimed at  stopping randomized loot boxes and pay-to-win mechanics in the game  industry. Today, **Hawley** was joined by Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Richard  Blumenthal (D-Conn.) in [formally introducing that bill](https://www.hawley.senate.gov/senators-hawley-markey-and-blumenthal-file-legislation-stop-manipulative-video-game-practices-aimed) in the Senate, complete with [an 18-page draft of its legislative text](https://www.hawley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/2019-05/Loot-Box-Bill-Text.pdf).

There's an exclusion to the p2w provision for purely cosmetic items:
---
7 (ii) COSMETIC ALTERATIONS.—Such
---
8 term shall not include an add-on transaction
---
9 to an interactive digital entertainment
---
10 product whose only effect is to alter
---
11 a user’s visual representation within the
---
12 game provided that it does not, from the
---
13 perspective of a reasonable user, provide
---
14 the user with a competitive advantage over
---
15 other users who do not make such transaction
---
This would mean that they could sell cosmetic alterations outright, but as the exclusion only applies to the p2w provision, they wouldn't be able to sell them via lootboxes.
---
In that case it might be an issue with your Internet Service Provider. We had disruptions earlier this year, and it turned out to be from line maintenance being performed up the street.  They completed work in about 48 hours and we were back to normal.
---
It is available a few other times, like maybe in August for the Anniversary sale, buy no one knows exactly when it will be back.
---
&gt; So maybe they can turn the magic they consume and refine it into these domains. 
---
That's the implication shown until Aurene. Not just that they can, but it happens automatically. Balthazar, despite taking in magic from Jormag and the Bloodstone, only ever used fire magic for example. Just as until they began taking in domains from dead Elder Dragons, the Elder Dragons had always converted the magic they consumed into their specific domains. Just as how Dhuum consumes souls, but turns it into his flavor of death magic (and mind magic? He's never associated with ice, but he does have the apparent power to implant thoughts and control minds like Mordremoth does, curiously).
---
While I agree completely I still think people were over reacting about it
---
&gt; That was Jessica price, who has posted and given a lot of interviews saying some pretty shitty things about Anet in what seems to be a fit of pique.

Gee I wonder why she might be angry at Anet..............

[Sanctum of Nabkha](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sanctum_of_Nabkha) is the only place that really comes to mind. [Tomb of the Primeval Kings](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tomb_of_the_Primeval_Kings) requires moving from chest to chest and is only really good for trade contracts. The Istan chests require metas or are once per day. Sandswept has a bunch of chests that only appear after metas as well, maybe the [puzzle chests](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Forgotten_Cache) aren't so bad. Thunderhead peak dwarf area boots you from it and you can't reveal chests anyways so that's out. You could just get the normal[ small dwarven chests](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dwarven_Chest) but they aren't that great.

if he doesnt fear death why was he afraid of a world without him
---
It depends on what you want to do together, but you definitely don't need to worry about playing more than your friends and outleveling them. GW2 does the best job I've ever seen in an MMO for scaling. Your level/base stats are scaled down to just above the level of the area (and as such, the level of most enemies), but your gear, skills, and traits are mostly unaffected, so your build works just as well (unless you're minmaxing and your build is focused on getting 100% critical chance, since that's dependant on level and base stats), but you're not underpowered or too overpowered, just a little stronger than players naturally at that level. So if you just want to have one character, don't worry about playing it when your friends aren't, you won't be massively overpowered, you'll just have access to more areas and an easier time in lower level areas, plus you get relatively consistent rewards and xp wherever you are (although higher level zones will give you more xp and better loot, lower level zones still give you plenty of xp and drop a mix of gear of your level and of the zone's level).
---
Story-wise, it's up to you. The story branches at certain points before converging towards the end. Every 10 levels you get access to another set of missions, and the missions from level 1-30 are dependant on your character's race and the background choices you chose during character creation. Level 40 missions depend on the group you chose to join at the end of the level 30 missions. Other missions, as well as certain aspects of missions, are dependant on this choice. Level 50 missions depend on a separate choice at the beginning of that tier, then all characters have mostly the same missions from levels 60-80, with a few dependant on choices made later and on your chosen order from level 40. However, you can play in other characters' missions without affecting your own (although maybe if you have the same mission, it counts for both of you, but I'm not sure). 
---
TL;DR: You're fine playing as much or as little as you want by yourself, you won't be leaving your friends behind or accidentally lock yourself out of any content.
---
Who's Blish? Oh, that one barely developed character that was killed off and never mentioned again, and none of the relevant characters even grieved for him for more than five minutes?
---
They can't pull that punch if it wasn't even a punch to begin with

They’re usually only a pain in the ass when you need to do long glides and you don’t have stealth gliding. Otherwise just stealth and its ezpz
---
i think they pointed out in the requiem its been 1 whole month that caithe hasnt heard from the commander, and she said its time to contact the commander now.
---
so episode 6 happens 1 month after aurenes death. why hasnt kralk healed yet.
---
this is not what corruption looks like. corruption would be if they got bribed by big daddy EA or some other rich as fuck company to amend the bill to make it more favourable to them or if they introduced a new bill to change an existing law to do the same thing.
---
Man I had the collectors edition of nightfall.  I need to get back into Guild Wars 2
---
I find that debatable. Particularly depending on how one defines "convenience purchases". If not purchasing such doesn't actually hinder the gameplay, then imo, it's fine.
---
A game company that runs an MMO doesn't necessarily need to be constantly creating new content, it's just good practice to since it's far more likely to draw and maintain a playerbase than either mere maintenance or just creating cosmetic and convenience goods.
---
How much is "too much" is fully subjective as well, and non-morality subjective matters shouldn't be so hardlined in laws.
---
The thought that, in some other realm, Gods are what EDs are to Tyria, is really interesting :)
---
The reasoning behind why Zhaitan could not use fire magic and whatever, by the way, I believe it is an entire different subject. Elementalists learnt the ways to use magic. Remember that, when energy was low, the first spell casters to appear required sacrifices to use their spells (necromancers for instance) in order to boost the low energy available. 
---
The magic we use in our spells is like an advanced form of magic. The magic presented in EDs is raw, unprocessed magic lets say. Now the Gods should be able to cast spells to, so why didn't we see Balth using ice skills or whatever? Maybe he converted the energies into fire magic only? Who knows ...
---
Yes, I understood that. I was also speaking on the aspect of "no control" you mention, but also on that notion of right and wrong (both from a mortal's and from *their* perspective).
---
Yeah, they have no control because their tormented self overthrows them, because it is stronger than them.
---
What "deliberately terrible and unfun mechanics" does gw2 implement that can be skipped by a convenience purchase?
---
Thank you! so there's a chance then, I'll keep watching then
---
It has a lot of boon strip and ways to interact with enemy boons. It also sacrifices better burst skills for full counter which requires you to block attacks. In general lots of PvE fights and bosses don't have a lot of boons and other professions can just remove them instead (Mesmers, Revenants, Necromancer). The only real place I'd take it in PvE would be harder fractals with no [pain no gain](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mistlock_Instability:_No_Pain,_No_Gain) or [vengeance](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mistlock_Instability:_Vengeance).

The first mount skins were released via the mount adoption license 6 weeks after the launch of PoF.
---
&gt; The reasoning behind why Zhaitan could not use fire magic and whatever, by the way, I believe it is an entire different subject.
---
I'd consider the notion of Zhaitan consuming magic imbued by the Six into their temples and statues to be the very same subject as Aurene consuming magic that bound Joko's soul to his body and made him immortal.
---
Unless the reasoning was that Aurene's "pool of consumed magic" was smaller thus more easily diluted by new magics, there should be no reason (that I can fathom or have heard from others) why Zhaitan couldn't use that imbued magic in the same way as Aurene using Joko's.
---
It is clearly stated during the story of this season. He was not afraid of a world without him. That was glints assumption from the reaction of kralkatorrik after his vision. It was told trough the words of a biased narrator. We don't know why he took actions after his own vision but it was not out of fear.

Her tweets afterwards that she was on a private twitter account that wasn't associated with her job- which was linked in AMAs and was the same account she had just used to write a 25-tweet article for the community about the design process and the choices required?

She was on her public twitter listed on her public arenanet profile and on public AMAs as the way to contact her, writing a mini article for the public. And then claims it's not fair to be policed on her private life.
---
Really dude? Vertical filming of your screen with a phone? It's 2019 come on...
---
Awesome thanks. Maybe I'll relevel another Charr. I have a couple lvl 80 boosts but I'll save them for after I relevel and realize where I'm at in the story line.
---
Hahaha
---
I disagree.
---
I believe Kralkatorrik very much had control, but he was in so much pain that he had listened to everything his Torment told him about how to end that pain, and had felt the need to follow it because of that ceaseless pain.
---
A man driven to the extreme, even extreme pain, will do things he would normally not do. Why wouldn't a dragon, too? Especially since the only thing he did that he ever shows remorse for is killing Glint. Everything else, we have no real indication how much - or even *if* - he regretted the actions of.
---
ok i missed the part where you find out glint misinterpreted kralk. what i did catch is that he knew that that world would be unbalanced and in danger, and while he was around with the other 6 dragons the world was stable. that would explain everything hes done. "all the little ants that keep getting stepped on when u so much as move a muscle are trying to destroy me? stupid ants dont even know what this world is im doing this so there stupid little world will stay in one piece"
---
Yeah saving the boosts is typically what I recommend. I've used mine on secondary professions, the leveling process is one of the ways I feel I really am able to learn and experiment with a class because it gives you everything in small doses rather than all your skills and all available weapons all at once.
---
I dont think theyre terribly unfun
---
flew to close to the sun
---
Antici...pation
---
i disagree an episode of her still dead would have helped. what would have helped in my opinion was needing to actually take a few minutes to let the lich magic heal her, and we could be on an airship or something in the mean time heading toward wherever the tracker is pointing toward, and then she comes thru feeling ready again and we get on and go. it just felt like she recovered from even more serious wounds faster than joko did from being thrown around a bit

Would be surprising to get an RNG pack with skyscale skins soon.  The last pack came out only a few weeks ago and they have averaged around 4 months between packs so far.
---
I don't think they will be rushing to release skyscale skins.  As of this moment &lt;9% of accounts on gw2efficiency that have started S4E6 have acquired a skyscale, and that number is probably high for the general population.  They'll want to wait for a bigger chunk of their active players to have the skyscale unlocked before releasing skins.
---
The response from the ESA at the end is the big news in the article.  This bill will quite obviously not become law, but it has ruffled enough feathers to get a real conversation started.
---
Charr dont raise their young though.
---
I hopped o to dragonfall. There are so many events you can do and for me at least it is also the only lws 4 map that i wasnt sick of farming by that point in time. If you are lucky, you get to tag 3-4 events at the same time because they happen to bump into each other and spawn mobs on the same spot.
---
Thats not a lie.
---
Regarding Joko, his ability isn't unique among dragons. You can't kill an elder dragon by bombarding it. This was evident in most recent patch, where pact bombardment did nothing to Kralkatorrik. It was also evident in  HoT where Mordremoth kept regrowing. Zhaitan was an exception, but not entirely so. Hear me out: You don't kill a dragon. You move its magic around.
---
...back when GW had an awesome story and fresh gameplay mechanics...
---
Well... there is a good chunk of skill involved with every class in gw2. The difference between a beginner and an experienced player can add up quite significantly in dmg and survivability despite both wearing the same gear. With so less information it is impossible to say what you are doing wrong. So the most important part regarding your problem is: A longbow autoattack will deal more dmg the further you are away from an enemy (that is the reason why many group oriented builds - where you have to stack closely - are not in favor of a longbow). But if you are wearing full berserker - like stated by your post - than a single rapid fire opener + pet attack (F2) should annihilate normal, non veteran enemies. Especially if you are combining this with utilities like "sic' em", "quickening zephyr" or "strengh of the pack"
---
How is the value of death ruined? Plenty of characters have died for realsies, Aurene is an exception and had a very obvious setup for her resurrection
