Casondra here, hehe. This looks fantastic! I've never seen something printed on acrylic glass before, but I see why now. It seems to be glowing! I am so happy your wife loved it! It was a pleasure working with you, it really was. :)

---
Happy Holidays! Eat lots of sweets!

---
The Pale Tree is still not back to normal, right? A bit of poison or fire, we could make a whole *race* of orphans!
---
As much as the prospect of new mounts excites me from new niches to explore and new skins to match, I hope we don't get new mounts for a while. I don't want the future of masteries is just "mounts, mounts, and more mounts." Each of the mounts with PoF were really cool and I loved them but there was a certain degree of fun with HoT masteries because each thing was so distinct and disparate. Diversity in what the masteries are like with HoT but with creativity like with PoF and the living world seasons would be a killer combo and I worry that mounts will starve that potential out.
---
&gt;hat single hit with FGS4 is the highest single damage ability you can use. That's what you use it for, then you immediately drop it. 
---
So fgs5 isn't needed then? Do you know that it actually deals more damage than fgs4? Like, a lot more? Ten times more or so?
---
I've asked not about the rotation itself (which is now when I read it you wrote up kinda wrong), but about what makes you think that fgs isn't the "legit" part of the rotation. So far the best answer you gave, is that it somehow "interrupts" the rotation, which is decisively untrue, since the part that is taken by fgs would otherwise be taken by (incomplete) fire aa chain. Oh well. 
---
It is your right, to adjust the rotation to your preferences (and capabilities), but you should really keep it as your deeply personal preference.
---
I've been lookin for ppl to do the Serpents Ire meta event but no one really does it anymore it seems like 🙄
---
Beautiful artwork, and that white outfit is so pretty.
---
Anet answered my prayers.
---
OMG thank you for sharing, this is priceless haha
---

---
Not the first time this happens tho, also in the same pack you have the branded bettle. But at least you can get the single skin for 1200gems, the branded skyscale is locked behind a 2k gem pack...
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
ok, thank you for the help anyways
---
(returning player here) The game worked perfectly for me a few months ago before I had to AFK for a while. Upon returning I am having the same problem on Mac. Every "fix" I try is not helping and it is super frustrating. If someone has a solution to this for Mac I would greatly appreciate it.
---
I'm annoyed that it's called an aqua stalker in the wild but ours is a cheetah, and therefore it can't swim??
---
That skill is only useful for the small chance to shoot a cow with the dust tornado
---
I like this idea it keeps the conjure sharing while allowing Weaver to maintain a consistent rotation. Might also put Weaver back in the meta bracket with all the free conjures going around.
---
The issue with ingame lag is a well-known driver bug with the RX 5700. Downgrade your driver to the last "2019 edition" driver and enable oversampling in the GW2 settings to greatly increase GPU load. This should keep the GPU from idling and improve performance, amusingly.
---
Yes, must feel bad on your hands spamming that 1 button
---
Just got a fix for it from the creator of that post,thanks.
---
Well you probably shouldn't carry out your rotation if you think it's gonna kill you...
---
&gt; Power/Pre (but often very little ferocity)
---
Ferocity is your minor stat because you'd need to increase your **crit chance** first before your **crit damage**. It'd make very little sense to increase your ferocity if your precision is low. 
---
&gt; so many viper pieces (very easy to cap burn duration without full vipers and bleeds are a DPS loss if you're a Tempest)?
---
You can get the next best gear, grieving.
---
Personally I was more of a LoD or ZB monk :P
---
Hah, even the name is an analogy for 'toothless' - 'Short' 'fang'. :D
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
I'd like to have them reworked into something more like kits that you can put away and bring back at any moment.  
---
Instead a duration, they could have 60 ammo shared by all skills, and some skills would use more ammo than others, and the ammo counter would show how many times the skill can be used with the current ammo, like with the Vlast Avenger.  The current total ammo would always be shown in the autoattack, since it would use just 1 ammo, but also in the conjure skill slot when the conjure is stowed away. 
---
The ammo would recharge over time while the conjure is stowed. 
---
Skill 5 for each conjure could be changed to use all remaining ammo and have its effect scale with the amount of ammo used, then the conjure trait could be given the added ability to produce the old version of the weapon as a bundle allies can use when using skill 5 of the conjured weapon , for players who miss the ability to give others a weapon. That bundle would be usable by allies, but not the elementalist, to remove the problem of feeling like others take your stuff.
---
Every time you go off and kill bandits, did you never stop to think of those bandits had a family?  That they might have been driven to a life of banditry to try and ensure their kid(s) get a chance at a better life?
---
Wow. There's a name I haven't heard in a long time...
---
Well, did you backtrack past that third arch?  Because as I said, it would have been the second that you'd actually missed, and you can't go through the third arch until you properly go through the second.
---
You did get the achievement on your next try, I'm just suggesting what might have been the issue that caused it to mess up.  And if you were actually teleporting, that just lends more credence to my theory...
---
Yea I did backtrack. There wasn’t any arch before that. But got it anyway so that’s good. My issue wasn’t about teleporting but how despite backtracking and physically going through without teleporting, it wouldn’t count.  Unless I changed maps (or probably restarting the race). So strange.
---
Nope, it was in the Skyscale Ascension Mount Pack at 2k gem

Pretty cool but that's not 100% accurate since it doesn't contain trash
---
Hopefully this helps someone! Thanks for posting in here about it :)
---
Don't mind asshats. They exist everywhere and they're usually the loudest and most abnoxious as well.
---
I agree. Very refreshing.
---
yeah thats a warrior effect but i cant remember what causes it. you could change your skills and traits one by one to figure out what it is. i think it has to do with adrenaline regeneratior but maybe im wrong.
---
If you plan to pug, don't ask for kp if you lead. Ask for something that makes someone read the lfg (ping boots, etc).
---
Kp is archaic and worthless. No matter the amount of kp you ask for, people will still be the same skill level, even if you don't ask for any.
---

Look at the edit I made🙃
---
tbh I love both
---
Condi is nice, if more complex, because you get to dip a toe into water and earth.
---
Power is nice because of that sweet, sweet off-rotation Fresh Air (mostly for breakbars).
---
Australia is YEARS ahead of the rest of the world!
---
These are on backorder there! Lol
---
Really? Most of my dog's chew toys are 20+
---
I've always found it odd that an Engineer can put away a giant watermelon-sized bomb and pull out a flamethrower+backpack much faster than a master of elements can conjure an immaterial hammer made of lightning.
---
Fall for it? Some folks actually like this stuff.
---
This isn't a trick someone falls for. It's just different tastes than yours ( or mine.)
---
Open a training group. It's actually not extremely hard to get a kill with noobs assuming everyone knows mechanics.  
---
Bringing an experienced friend is usefull, as they can point out mistakes or missed mechanics.
---
The comment says that conjures can be precasted and shared, which is enjoyable.
---
I would urge you to reevaluate how you see power weaver functionality as a whole. This "perfect rotation" you've mentioned in a few replies only confuses me. Why glorify a "loop" like that? Its just a loop, most classes have one. Perhaps look at the attunements as the defining feature of weaver (since they obviously are) and you'll see its rotation in a different light.
---
Weavers are effectively locked out of a lot of their skills, thats why they dont use most of their 26 weapon abilities in their loop. The attunement cooldowns create a lot of gaps in the weaver rotation which you'd want to fill with good utility skills. Sadly there arent many of those that are better than a simple aa chain so we are limited to using glyph storm and conjures. Now because these skills have long cooldowns (excluding fire glyph storm) they are excluded from the loop. However they are an integral part of the classes gameplay and identity.
---
I admit that conjures are a bit clunky and could use some cleaner animations but they are unique and offer great variety in their uses.
---
Must have been confused by the name of the sub. My curiosity has been satiated.
---
Casondra, fantastic work. This is beautiful.
---
Okay, this makes me want someone in my future to propose to me with a black lion chest containing a ring.
---
That would be so awesome Haha
---
Other games : Here is some free shit for Christmas
---
GW2 : Come spend $$$$$ on gemstore.
---
And mine! I think we all had the same looking Monks lol.
---
Looks like OP already figured it out, but for anyone else curious, it's: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Soldier%27s_Focus
---
The bar is red Owl. As you can see, the bar is red.
---
Ohh Thanks, I ordered mine just now from Popculta. 
---
Finally something I can get in Aus without a huge shipping cost
---
No thanks. It’s a trap for new players to get confused. I wish we could get rid of cultural utility skills and implement them as special action keys during the core tyrian leveling experience (unlocked via mastery points).
---
I agree with this, at least as far as the classes in WoW and how much they have been oversimplified, stupified, even, and just overall no longer feel that great to play.  The last time I played, right when they changed everything down to two or three buttons per class, and nuked any real need to think about a rotation, I gave up on it.  They made WoW so gear driven to the point nothing else seems to matter.  It became a great disappointment.  
---
However, going so far as PoE in complexity is also not what I want.  Though I miss the idea of skill trees in ff14, it at least gives me complex rotations I can play around with, the nice macro system that my programmer side enjoys, and plenty of skills and classes to keep myself entertained, which is the whole point of these kinds of games.
---
I'd rather the keybinds be on a per-character basis.
---
That'd be a lovely addition, as long as it was optional
---
That sounds really nice, I like this idea. It also takes care of the awkward "use 1-2 skills and drop it for optimal dps" situation.
---
Hard wood and soft wood isn't a measure of hardness, and the item names are likely referencing features other than whether the tree is angiosperm or gymnosperm.
---
For example, balsa wood is a hardwood and also the softest known wood, and longleaf pine is a softwood and is harder than several hardwoods.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softwood
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardwood
---
**Softwood**
---
Softwood is wood from gymnosperm trees such as conifers, as well as Amborella. The term is opposed to hardwood, which is the wood from angiosperm trees.
---
***
---
**Hardwood**
---
Hardwood is wood from dicot trees. These are usually found in broad-leaved temperate and tropical forests.  In temperate and boreal latitudes they are mostly deciduous, but in tropics and subtropics mostly evergreen. Hardwood contrasts with softwood (which is from gymnosperm trees).

Indeed. It should probably be flying or sitting in a tree.
---
Though the trees are probably full of dog sized spiders, so maybe three ground is a good place to be.
---
The loot box version are gambling, and the non-loot box versions are too expensive, well more than they were in bundles. One thing they need to do in 2020 is sort this out, offer these skins at a more reasonable direct price. They should not cost so much more than the loot box.
---
Good bot.
---
I miss the class dependent armor so much. It was soo good, well detailed and well thought. And they were something really special if you got your hands on one of the rare ones. What we have in GW2 isn't just the real thing anymore.
---
And those classes. Lovely!
---
There are no bosses that favour condition damage....
---
I read this in Tommy Wiseau's voice.
---
They would add keybind loadouts to the gem store if this became a thing 😔
---
It flaps louder.
---
There are curently too many players and snow effects, lowering your setting to best performance is the best thing to do but not sure if it has somthing to do with your problem if its not crashing.
---
I barely use it because of one time use per cooldown.
---
We need more karma, we can't stop.
---
Also monks aren't in GW2 (sadness). Haha
---
&gt; Ehhh prior to mounts fgs was a movement skill for me
---
And it was glorious
---
Hope people know this is no longer the case. I've seen my Boost go up to 12 hours and over.
---
I really like the idea, I was so confuse to see this particle on this new char when my others didn't...
---
Was so perfect for her "lore". xD
---
Oh, sorry about that. And thanks for posting it :)
---
How the hell does that skip work
---
I disagree a little bit, if you don't ask for any proof it is possible the person has never killed the boss and got all their Li from Escort, also the more a person has killed a boss the more experience they have with it and are more likely not to snowball when things take a bad turn.
---
However skill has no correlation with KP, you can have amazing players that just don't have or keep KP. The problem is, you are more *likely* to get a smoother experience by asking for it.
---
Nostalgia is real, man do I miss the buzz of playing the first GW when I was a kid

Did... did my gems just disappear? I usually have a little left over which I was saving up, but now I log in and I see my gem balance is exactly 0? I'm so confused...
---
Putting the graphics option "Animations" to low removes ghostly infusions from everyone, but also some of your own animations like the aura from Xiuquatl.

I headcanon this with the Commander's reputation preceding them and the red mobs are just panicky idiots jumping the gun and attacking out of the fear that comes with having *The Slayer of Gods and Dragons* passing through your scratch/krawl/collective/etc...

I play with a significant amount of pugs and have seen that. It also makes sense from a logical standpoint.

Just like the frogs, I just thought there's Skritts that's friendly to other people and those that are not.

Oh no, it's shining blue, when it gets new items now. Until you click on it once. Get over it, other game's ingame stores are way more annoying. 
---
I personally missed some free items over the years, because I didn't checked the shop, so I'm okay with that decent shining.
---
The old Lion still had his backbone so they had to get rid of him. 
---
Derpy, the new Lion, got picked for two reasons. He is the most followed Lion on Instagram and has zero dignity when it comes to product endorsement.
---
I think it has more to do with it being a daily for today
---
That's not a mistake, it's intentional. The Skritt, Ogres, Hylek and Grawl all have allied and enemy factions in-game because they're tribal races, and not every tribe is friendly.
---
Game Is dead. Absolutely unplayable.
---
Exactly my thought
---
Was there ever any doubt?

[Yes, it is bugged](https://youtu.be/IwOd-KvDFR4?t=1181)

Me: you know what, I might not like where the game is heading at the moment, but I still had a pretty alright year with Gw2. Haven't bought anything from the store all year, I'll just throw 10€ at the store and be happy with whatever two skins I get, they all look pretty neat. Happy holidays, Anet.

---
Wow, thats gorgeous! Great work!
---
its the elite signet
---
moving on
---
Good explanation, nicely put.
---
What's worse is that this guy has supported the game by buying lots of gems. To then get a fuck you like this from Anet is heartwrenching.
---
you mean a revive orb and some boosters? it's like getting socks for christmas except they are not even as good as socks
---
he's not wrong though, most EA games still manage to keep an invested playerbase because the game is inherently fun, despite the scummy tactics with their microtransactions. anet should take some pointers on how to keep players if they want to start using their microtransaction tactics.
---
I hate traps.
---
 I've always hated the mechanic, even prior to HoT release. At least then, ranger was trash and went on the garbage heap where he belonged. So far I've been able to get by playing warrior dps instead of dragonhunter, but dragonhunter traps get me killed when I get a dh or a slb in my party. Traps precast feel so clunky and counter intuitive. I've resorted to playing reaper because at least it is easy and I can focus on my actual rotation and surviving. How do you other necro players deal with these meta dps classes?
---
lesson learned?
---
Yes the new Maximum is now 24 h
---
So far literally everything they touch turns into dust (RIP Dead Space) or shit (Dragon Age) or its just something I have no interest with to begin. 
---
Oh and lets not talk about Anthem.
---
Soo yeah, fuckea. Twice.
---
I am anxious sharing this. I find xmas Aurene, simply adorable and had to do my own take. ^^.
---
Fuck Anet.
---
You're assuming the person doesn't notice it within a day, adding a limitation like you can't instantly spend mystic coins received within 24 hours unless bought directly from the system would probably stop anything like that.  
---
In regards to required compute power, 200 transactions following a tree is not that high in computation, I deal with this type of stuff daily.   
---
The argument that matters the most that you have is the annoyance that happens to all the other customers, which is what I stated, need to check how far the coins have spread.
---
I NEED
---
Are you going to make the horns from pretzels?
---
Y'all some crybabies.
---
Don't want something? Close it. The shops in other games are much worse.
---
They want us to pay for gems so they can work on challenging group content
---
There is a special place in hell for those people. I did that with old banners.
---
By the way, the air elemental does more damage than the fire elemental.
---
In any case, how are you dying? The first use is pretty straightforward. The second use is admittedly awkward as it takes a moment to pick the greatsword up, but you should never pick it up when you're expecting to take a fatal hit.
---
omg, that's amazing!
---
yes, this is so annoying! I really don't like it
---
Maybe its focus assist messing with the game again.
---
For spotter, I would definitely put power zerker before power chrono. Power zerker without crit-capping is cancer. And power weaver after power chrono. Maybe if they're running Bolt to the Heart. But if you're talking about Fresh Air power weaver, then I strongly disagree.
---
if your goal is feeling welcomed only, then by all means don't ask anything of people..but if you want even a chance to get the kill or at least get past first phase some triage is necessary
---
and 70% bench is trivial, if you can't do that your knowledge of the build is severely lacking! trainings with billy the cleric reaper that pulls 500 dps won't go well and people will only learn the first 10% of a fight(spoiler: the fight gets progressively harder)
---
a proper training has voice which means discord or something similar that has text functionality as well..like cmon
---
They have gotten more aggressive with their gemstore over the last few years, but to no surprise I should add. They constantly take out items to put them in a week later, I've seen it countless times 'New/returning!' then it goes for 1 week, and returns literally the very next week as 'new/returning' again. 
---
Capes, mount skins, dyable backpieces that you have to gamble to get, and the unique rewards in black lion chests in the 'RNG special' slot have been better than anything you can get in the game by playing. 
---
This is the route anet have taken, they want ppl who log in once a month to open the gemstore and for it to feel new and exciting, and these players drop money on it then go away for a few months again. This is why their story strategy is so effective combined with this marketing. Just sucks if you're invested in the game because anet are only really producing content for the money these days, the lack of any meaningful content for Q1 roadmap pretty much sums up game is just on further milk mode.
---
Just because others are worse we need to get worse than what we already had? 
---
You are calling people crybabies because they give their opinions about an obvious downgrade.
---
That, and it was right after reset.
---
Just buy the standard tier. If you want the other stuff in the bundles, then you'll realize it later and you wouldn't be missing out on too much savings.
---
its a god damn tiny blue light. how upset can this reddit get anymore? jeez.
---
It doesn't 'look' printed, it is printed.
---
you call an icon shining a little bit blue a "obvious downgrade" ? some people in here are really mental.
---
A few days ago it was all pink comms
---
&gt; spammed by increasingly aggressive crap.
---
WTF, it's a tiny blue shine that disappear as soon as you open your TP. 
---
Stop overreacting. xD
---
&gt; They want us to pay for gems so they can ~~work on challenging group~~ put gemstore content
---
For anyone who doesn't play FFXIV, this isn't true in the slightest. There is no in-game shop in FFXIV; you must purposely navigate to an out-of-game website. And no, advertisements for the shop don't pop up when you login, either.
---
The collection is now listed in the Festival Collections achievement tab, which should mean that it can be completed year-round, even though it can only be started during Wintersday.  As such, even if you don't level up enough to get to Orr zones before Wintersday ends, the items should still be available to find whenever you do finally get there.
---
So no, you don't have to rush it.
---
Didn't know it took 8 hours to print that lol.
---
Know nothing about 3D printing :p
---
“It’s worse elsewhere so it’s okay that it’s shit here too.”
---
As much as I want to share it, I made this for someone special and don't want to give it out. :3
---
Though if you are interested I can create something from the game (or anything else) as commission. Time will be depending on complexity. This model took around a week worth of work to create.
---
argument is they already don't so you may as well make them *better*
---
Does it make your screen go black too? I had some issues with my pretty new DVI cable after booting the game not since before I changed cables.
---
I thought the DVI was broken, switched back to HDMI (which does not allow for freesync monitors to activate gsync support, my monitor is freesync) and the problem went away. But now I am thinking it might be because I am using GW2 hook.
---
In that path boss' ads would not reset on a party wipe.
---
It vanishes as soon as you open up the trading post. Dang, if I got annoying at small things like this, my hair would be gray already.
---
So I haven't played in many many months, what's going on here exactly?
---
So. the Hinterlands Liberator. I have been hanging out hours in Hinterlands but for some reason both of the events that give me this item won't trigger at all. I play in EU server and I was even considering guest jumping to other place cause for some reason this just doesn't activate and I can't seem to find a timer or whatnot for this.
---
Thank you!
---
The issue is not that it is blue. The issue that it was not there before.
---
Really? That seems like super scam prone, I wonder why they went with this approach.
---
I totally understand! 
---
And I would absolutely love Aurene to death if you could model her. (Adolescent and baby) 
---
If I do commission, I'd want to make it available to the community. Because Aurene is just that awesome. 
---
I also know she has far more details than this little boy, so it'll take longer I'm sure. Though I don't know if I'd be able to pay you what you deserve for it, at least not for a month or so. 
---
If you want to sent me a quote or price guess (I understand it wouldn't be final, but a range to know what to save for would be great), I'll see what I can get accomplished!
---
That’s not an issue
---
They don’t want the shop to be obtrusive.  The shop itself is secure (same site you use to access your account) and the launcher links to it.
---
ESO is the most Eastern F2P game I've ever seen. /s
---
&gt; missed some free items
---
And you will keep missing them because they decide what's a "special" item and what's not. It's not tied to new either.
---
ESO does it; but thats more indirectly due to the daily system being integrated with it
---
All it requires for people to praise you is to be marginally less shit than the competition.
---
&gt;during the core tyrian **leveling experience** (unlocked via **mastery points**)
---
So only available for leveling alts after you have a level 80 on the account?
---
Yes, or for map completion on lvl 80 alts. We shouldn’t bloat expac or living world content with even more special action skills.
---
To be fair 2019 was a better year than 2018.
---
[I want peace on Earth and good will towards men.](https://youtu.be/JHU0HinVhYc)
---
That's different in complexity that such a minute UI change.
---
Because what this sub needs is more fuel for the ded-game-circlejerk
---
gw2 is a b2p game with mobile cashgrab f2p mechanics, because why be f2p when you don't have to.
---
hence why the expectations were higher and the disappointments were bigger
---
Now you're just arguing semantics.
---
This is a question better directed toward Support.
---
Thats like saying "Whats the big deal with pop-up ads, just click them". The point is that they are pushing stuff in my face that I don't want to see and that was not there before.
---
The only thing I am unsure here are legal questions. But for commissions I think that's all fine.
---
Can you send me screenshots / pictures of which pose exactly you are thinking about? Or artwork examples you like. Adolescent should be quite a bit more complex than the baby model.
---
Send me a private message here, via artstation or you can use mail. :3
---
&gt;Colin Henry: Diablo 4, Blitzchung, Peria canceled, GW2’s decline.
---
Did someone actually put Blizzard crime against freedome in same line with GW2 problems? Fuck that.
---
Ah so that's why they nuked LA
---
They spent minimal resources I'm sure to bring attention to something that generates revenue.  That's a good business decision.  You seem to forget ArenaNet is a business looking to make money.
---
There's always room for genuine criticism but the issue is that here the criticism has long since been abandoned for nitpicking and almost a pathological need to find disappointment in literally everything Anet does, or else you're a "white knight"
---
Hell, look at the front page, these days all it takes is a gemstore update for people to act like the devs broke into their house and shot their dog
---
I love how there is supposedly no in-between. Things can be so simple, right?
---
*John Wick intensifies*
---
Let's take wintersday as an example!
---
Compare the quality of this year's newly introduced stuff, with the quality of cash shop stuff coming up in a week. ;)
---
It makes sense. All the current big MMO's have either new expansions released or have some hype surrounding them, GW2 has literally no hype outside of story. 
---
In terms of MMO, yes this is hugely disappointing, in terms of single player game with multiplayer aspects you can argue it's doing great.
---
That is the irony in my comment. Going the opposite of one stance too much and you are circlejerking the opposite way, which is still a circlejerk and just as silly.
---
Sure, but when you start calling it a singleplayer game with multiplayer aspects it comes into direct contact with FF14. Which it doesn't have a single high point against aside from its price.  
---
That also puts it against games like Dark Souls, which is another pretty bad place to be.
---
Looks lovely :3
---
They can make money by releasing meaningful content that makes people want to actually play the game instead of selling cookie cutter skins that promote afking in mistlock with 20 auras on.
---
Less raids, less fractals, no progress for pvp or wvw development, lay offs, iceboob "saga"... 2019 was great indeed
---
It was a simple rule: no political topics during the tournament.
---
If for you making a game mobile garbage is in the category of " crime against innocent people", it may be time to put down the internet and go for a walk.
---
&gt;Blitzchung
---
Hon, we talking about Blitzchung not mobile garbage.
---
&gt; Did someone actually put Blizzard's crime against innocent people
---
Like it or not Blitzchung broke the rules. He's not innocent. 
---
You might be confusing Blizzard with China.
---
Maybe people find disappointment in everything Anet does because everything Anet has done lately has been overall pretty disappointing.
---
That was not disappointment, that was outrage.

I'm not trying to make gw2 look good, I don't enjoy the game after this year. I think it's just ignorant to say gw2 is a terrible game when a ridiculous amount of people log in every patch for festivals or the new story/map.
---
Author is alluding to the JP incident.
---
Not enough tags in this picture lol .
---
Gw2 is objectively bad mmo. Story is nothing special either if you want to compare it to single player games. Thousands of flies sit on shit every day. Does it make shit good?
---
BUt don't forget..
---
**FUNKO POPS!!!!**
---
\&gt;You might be confusing Blizzard with China
---
We talking about company where employee can write -"We will protect pride of our country" on perfect mandarin. Mhm.
---
And yet what else have gaming publications popularly referred to as "caving to reddit"?
---
When they say that ANET is "craving to the subreddit", they don't mean the demands for more raids.
---
Anet should because that's becoming the common feeling around GW2. Doomed game just plodding along until someone steps up and admits it's over.
---
I played pretty much every MMO with player housing
---
"Tupperware"?
---
It certainly has nutritional value for them :p
---
No mention of the garbage fire that was Bless Online's wetsern launch? It released in 2018 and shutdown this year so maybe that made it ineligible...
---
Gonna grab some popcorn for the cringe-inducing defensive comments.
---
Depends on whom you ask. To the thousands of flies?
---
See, you're [not even wrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_even_wrong).
---
The mechanism for it to have a blue glow requires implementing method of communication between the game UI and the store, which is a separate application. If it's a new system, it has to be designed from the grounds up. If it's an existing system, it has to be tested to make sure adding a new globally broadcast state with a separate "seen" flag for each account doesn't negatively impact its current uses.
---
The icon has been moved to the end of the bar because of some issue that came up during testing. Someone noticed it interferes with gw2taco, making the latter draw over it. We can assume gw2taco checks the length of the icon array to know where to draw, but this change made the array one shorter. This lets us suspect that the new icon isn't really drawn by the game itself, but by the TP app. If that's true, they had to spend resources implementing this.
---
See? We don't even know how much work went to making this.
---
This.
---
I had fun playing through Factions again as a Dervish.
---
Do I have any fun replaying LS2 as a Renegade? No, because there's no stimulating challenge which makes your build matter.
---
And ANET doesn't have excuse for this tutorial bullshit. We're not only TWO expansions down the game's lifespan (PoF), but most players have experienced the POST-Expansion story (LS4), and now we're in the POST-POST-Expansion story (LS5). How fucking long does this game need to be before it stops being a tutorial?
---
Green isnt removed after enrage timer and reaching 99 on cm paralyzes you
---
Obviously it's an opinion, but I 100% disagree.
---
The story in FF14 right now is the best its ever been, and easily my 2nd favorite FF story ever. There's a reason Shadowbringers has a 91 on metacritic.
---
The patch cadence and additions are amazing. We get patches at the same cadence as the old living world updates, but they always contain an extreme amount of things to do. The last big patch contained multiple raids, several dungeons, new armor, 2 new story updates, a crafter rework, a new crafter endgame, a new beast tribe, new game+ (replay any old main story quest), new housing districts and items, a new minigame in the Gold Saucer, an updated trust system, player made music updates, new custom deliveries, new mounts, minions, and barding.  
---
That's all free with the patch. There have been a couple update patches since then with more changes, such as a new PvP map and balancing patch.  
---
The only thing right now that GW2 has better than FF14 is PvP-- but at least FF14 still has regional tournaments for its PvP.
---
Dude, this moron called WoW a dead game 2 days ago... I have a hunch he might literally be braindead.
---
Are you that dissapointed when you open your fridge?
---
You're missing the point. Real journalists don't turn the news into their own political agenda and they sure as hell don't twist the truth into their views.
---
Gay people existing and being acknowledged isn't political
---
If you are new to raiding, or even just picking up a new class, you should spend time whacking the golem before you start learning a boss. This is likely the most common failing I see in new raiders. It is doing nobody any good if you're trying to learn to play your class and learn boss mechanics at the same time; save the other nine people you're playing with some headache and do your homework beforehand.
---
Understand why your build takes the gear and traits that it does. For some classes, say power DPS, this is as straightforward as "crit cap and take as many damage modifiers as possible." But even then, you should be aware of changes you may need to make depending on the boss. If you're tanking, you'll need to up your toughness depending on the squad comp. 1151 for power soulbeast, 1251 for firebrand, 1381 for soulbeast HK at Deimos, etc.
---
 
---
Be aware of what your responsibilities are and that they may change depending on your comp. E.g. if you're playing DPS on sloth, you should be aware that you'll likely be asked to eat a mushroom. The number of times I've joined an "experienced" sloth pug and had nobody willing/able to eat a mushroom is astounding. Also on Sloth, if you're chrono, know that you're responsible for either grouping slublings or for pulling them onto the boss as soon as they spawn, and coordinate with the other chrono. If you've only got one chrono in the squad, and you're the druid, know that you're now responsible for pulling the grouped slublings onto the boss with axe 4, so you should have an offhand axe available.
---
Be aware of things that you may be doing to hurt your group. It is one thing to be inexperienced or unprepared, but it is quite another if you're being actively detrimental. Projectile destruction/reflection comes to mind as a prime example here. You'll find many daredevils pugging Cairn who have no idea that the third attack in their auto chain reflects projectiles. Ditto chronos taking Medic's Feedback. Ditto druids using Sublime Conversion during Matthias' dome.
---
Understand group compositions. Know where your boons are coming from, especially if you're responsible for providing them. E.g. if you're chrono, but your squad has an alacrity renegade, you should drop Well of Recall for Mimic. You're responsible for keeping up quickness in your subgroup and for extending it in the other subgroup if it's coming from multiple DH with FMW but do not need to worry about alacrity. If you're playing druid in a comp with a boon thief, you do not need stone spirit, etc. Likewise for class-specific buffs. As DPS, know which your gearing assumes you have and how to adjust if you don't have them. E.g. many power DPS classes assume spotter in order to crit cap; if you don't have spotter, you'll need to adjust your gear and/or food to compensate for the 100 lost precision. As a commander, you should know how to organize subgroups efficiently. Suppose you're doing MO with boon thief, alacrity ren, druid, banners, and six DH. You should put all the DH in a subgroup with the renegade to make the most of Assassin's Presence. I see many commanders rigidly adhering to a 5/5 subgroup split for no reason.
---
While I think all of the above are quite important for good raiders, it's a lot to be expected to pick up all at once. Practice, and learn from your mistakes. Yes, you'll make mistakes. At any experience level. It's not a personal failing, and you should not let it discourage you from continuing.
---
Why do you think it's the worst? I've had fun decorating my houses, but I've not played a lot of MMOs with housing.
---
at least if it is a disappointment it means people still expect things from it.    
---
In terms of mmo, I think I agree with it being the biggest disappointment, this year the august presentation happened.    
---
That was a rollercoaster, they created the sensation even among sceptics that somethings big was coming. Even the most cynical of fans were like "they can't be so stupid to hype this shit so much and not have something to deliver". And then, what was revealed was on a much different scope to what was expected.    
---
They even were dishonest with the expectations they created, because they said that after season 4, season 5 would follow but it would contain "expansion like features", suggesting a bigger scope for seasons, and yet non were revealed, and non have been released.    
---
In truth, what the whole thing meant was that they are a smaller studio now, with a smaller scope, so they won't make any big productions for the game, maps released will be smaller, divided in more episodes because they need to stretch what they release even more than before, and that they wanted to disassociate with the previous concept so they could safely release smaller updates.    
---
No company makes a big presentation to say that they will do less because they can't keep up, but Anet did.    
---
Of course I'm not saying that everything is bad, a smaller scope means that they get to put more attention to details (and it has shown, from the quality of the last update, to how they're revisiting old content, something players have asked for years).    
---
Yet, even then, it's dissapointing, players want new elite specs, players want to feel excited for wvw and pvp again, and players want challenging content like raids and high level fractals. Which players? well, the ones that expected more from Anet.
---
That's the point.  You can only decorate. 
---
Watch some wildstar housing videos.  That is great housing!
---
Even f2p games like Rift have better housing than TESO.
---
Ok I take it back, PvE basicly equal content with 3 episodes vs 3 episodes, 1 pve mount, 1 raid and 1 fractal in each year. 
---
The difference is a new pvp map in 2018 vs warclaw, prologue, legendary runes and sigils, build templates, cooking 500 in 2019.
---
Imagine thinking all journalists are either SJWs (like that's necessarily a bad thing?) Or "Reddit parrots" lmao
---
i don't think a new class past revenants - which gave us the missing third heavy class - was ever really on the table. elite specs on the other hand are actually plausible... chances of actually getting new ones however are pathetically low. then you have expansions which i would argue are even less likely.
---
but as always we don't have any confirmation beyond "they are definitely on the table™"
---
&gt; 1 new class out over the course of 7 years
---
Their solution was the elite specs, not WoW model, which they have released 18 over 4 years. The only class added was to make all weight classes equal amount, I don't see a reason for them to add more.
---
I may not be the smartest or the sharpest mind but y'all leave much to be desired.
---
D4 disappointment? Huh I though it looked really cool compared to D3. Similar to D2. But this is wrong subreddit to debate on that.
---
Have you done [this](https://i.gyazo.com/cc7204c1acc83c6591fea679f14f4051.png)? Also how are you checking your current Hz? In monitor menus? Are you experiencing screen tearing while in-game?
---
&gt; IT was intentionally designed like that or we would have separate icons for TP and gemstore
---
yes well done
---
&gt;how is that not equally bad
---
its not a competition
---
seems like they didnt heard we got build templates in 2019.  literally the best year of gw2 for me
---
Arcdps had an addon where you could turn off elements of the HUD like the story tracker. Maybe Anet will add a shitty version of that to the gemstore someday.
---
They will continue to release elite specializations.
---
That’s how they expand on classes
---
No new classes. Maybe new race though? Unlikely, but there has been minuscule hints towards that during these 7 years.
---
Yes, there will be new elite specs and potentially an expansion in the future. No one knows how distant future.
---
No information about yes/no to either of those questions. As of right now, we assume not currently in development based off recent anet answers. 
---
Just install 14 and uninstall gw2. Ff14 is a real game- Gw2 is f2p and easy to pick back up. Just come back in a year for maybe more to do.
---
Never did
---
No new raids of fractals will be released until the end of next year or 2021. Wvw is only getting warclaw balance in the first quarter. As far as alliance it will not be happening soon. 
---
Story is truly short. And as lengthy as a main story chapter. None of the maps make we want to come back. The maps give no amalgamated gemstones which will make people not care. The new map doesn’t even have an ending chest. Just ingots in hoping to make 32 slot bags. Idk why people are excited for that.
---
That wasn't the rule. If you read the actual rule, it's clear that it should be applied to *many* more players than Blitzchung. It says "offends a portion or group of the public". Do you really think Blitzchung is the only player who has done that?
---
ᴄʀɪᴇs ɪɴ sɪᴍʟɪsʜ
---
Lol what's it like to be that wrong?
---
i kinda like that now it announces there is new stuff i usually keep missing many items added , thats why i was following the forums updating of items thread
---
That looks like it's made of marzipan .... mmmmmm
---
And now we're all sad that GW2 is only a GW1 sequel in name and lore.
---
My monk was the first time I actually enjoyed healing.
---
i have tried all this and everything else and still can not get it to drop files remaining
---
328 people have voted for that. Well not a massive number and i guess those are the people that play gw and have been doing so for some time now. I guess they want something more for it and thats why the negative vote.
---
Let's all just go back to GW1.
---
They are not dead or sick. They got laid off with compensation. Why would you care about people who dont even know you exist?
---
He stated his disappointments; it doesn't mean he's equating the two. Don't get your undies in a bunch. 
---
This year has convinced me that GW2 doesn't have any solid reason for me to keep playing. Haven't played in months.
---
Fair point but if the issue is "distracting from the game" then unfortunately homophobes will cause a big distraction in this kind of situation. Although perhaps giving them reason to come out of the woodwork so you can ban them might not be the worst plan. Heh.
---
I never said I was in any way against showing support for LGBT+, just that purely from the perspective of "distracting from the game", both things will to some degree, whether we want that or not.
---
why dont you just go and fuck yourself?
---
You are hyped because you are misinformed.
---
Breitbart source as your news oh boy
---
Respect
---
Lmao Imagine being hyped about unconfirmed drips of content over the course of who knows how many months.
---
&gt; what’s path of exile
---
Lol, I didnt know that. If its true and not joke.. well.. it was just one dev, right? Right? Oh boy.
---
Story instances are a goddamn joke anyway. Their gameplay sucks, plain and simple. The rewards are absolute trash too. I've said it for years, they're the cancer killing this game, zero exxagerations.
---
Why they didn't keep GW1's cooperative mission system is beyond me. GW2 loves to defy logic, for all the wrong reasons.
---
The least invasive way would be to have a way of opting in to see this. Adds nothing of value to the play session imo
---
Shills, white knights, and fanboys are this subreddit's bread and butter, my friend.
---
Wish they invested money and time making the game be good, instead of making it look good.
---
The category is "biggest MMO disappoontment"
---
Blizzard isn't an MMO, and the Blitzchung controversy was for Hearthstone, not WoW.
---
JP was 2018.
---
having opinions on the apropriateness of politics in supposedly apolitical media is a political stance
---
that's a cool subjective opinion that has nothing to do with whether or not the game is art. It was marketed and sold as art, it was recieved as art, and it has been praised as art.
---
The word you're looking for is preachers.
---
Journalism no longer exposes the truth, now they manufacture it instead.
---
There 3 tiers of WvW armor.
---
Triumphant: Exotic with selectable stats, only once, cannot be changed afterwards.
---
Triumphant Hero: Exotic with selectable stats, only once. aquisition requires the matching triumphant armor piece, can be upgraded into ascended/legendary precursor and eventually can be upgraded into legendary, once a legendary you can freely change stats.
---
Mistforged Triumphant Hero: Ascended,
---
 requires matching triumphant hero piece, also requires a specific WvW rank.
---
same!
---
It's propably hard for them to justify new elite specs when the content they produce has no use for them.
---
Dont bring logic, objective looks, and understanding to this subreddit. You'll just be downvoted.
---
And here is my opinion. FFXIV story is the most bland, cliche garbage i have ever seen, presented in the most boring and lazy way possible, even now, after 7 years has passed since GW2 launch, they're still using this static garbage Personal Story dialogues and 80% of them aren't even voiced.  
---
This big patch that launched in the end of October and contained multiple raids was the first since july and i can talk for hours how much i hate FFXIV raids, in 2009 we were riding on literal tanks fighting flaming leviathan and in 2019 we're running from the same fucking circles for 20th fucking time properly positioning ourselves, because Square Enix has no imagination or desire to do anything other than rehashing old content. Even their latest alliance raids, the Nier one, they added a cool ass sequences with flying on a drone and surfing in pipe, but those are just fucking cutscenes which throws you into the same fucking circle/square arenas where you just dodge shit! 
---
Beast tribes are literally just daily quests, being happy about new beast tribe is like being happy about hearts in GW2. 
---
New Game+ in the way it's implemented has no reason to exist. There's no achievements, no rewards, no experience, no nothing tied to it, it's not "New Game+" it's "Previous Game-" Your previous walkthrough minus all the rewards and unlocks you got while doing the story. 
---
New housing district is nice. 
---
Custom deliveries are pointless weeklies but with additional steps. 
---
Trust system only reinforces my gripes with FFXIV, i bought FFXIV because everyone were saying that it's the best MMO, but it's not an MMO, it's a single player game with hubs and matchmaking, and trust system only confirms this.
---
The savings were unacceptable. They had to be removed.
---
&gt; the JP incident.
---
What's this, now?
---
&gt;The only reason you'd equate these two is to argue in bad faith.
---
Arguing in bad faith is making bad straw-men arguments because you lack the ability to back up your own argument, kind of like exactly what your doing right now. I never equated those two things. I said you can care about both of them, because of course you can, I wont be able to help you if you cant see the blatancy of this.
---
Delete this comment too, you're embarrassing yourself.
---
I pre-ordered mine from the online Shumi Store.
---
Yeah, we don't know. Which is why jumping to conclusions is stupid. This is just a bandwagon to try and downplay the guy's statement. 
---
*It's not as bad as what Blizzard did!*
---
Yeah, no shit. Doesn't mean that GW2 and Anet weren't massive disappointments this year.
---
That's not how UI works... in fact, that's not how programming works at all.
---
The bobblehead laboratory works on them, producing hilarious results.
---
Problem is, Blizzard isn't an mmo. It's a company. And the outrage had nothing to do with WoW, it was Hearthstone.
---
Jinkies!
---
You continue to ignore whats going on in the world, and I continue to see that position as rot in the roots of democracy. 
---
All you did in this discussion was make a statement, then dodging responsibility by saying "well i dont care".
---
you can also skip the 6th snowflake with dodge jump at 0:04
---
It is the same in destiny 2. I spend my money elsewhere.
---
I have g-sync on, on everything, fullscreen and windowed apps. Works just fine with GW2. You have v-sync off from in-game settings? And have you checked both the nVidia control panel and GeForce Experience that there ain't some conflicting settings on?
---
&gt; Why they didn't keep GW1's cooperative mission system is beyond me
---
"bEcAuSe nOt eVerYoNe cAn fInD a GroUp!!!!!"
---
It keeps the game afloat for the people who don’t pay for anything by the people who utilize it, so therefore by the law of the land the gemstore is evil.
---
This is going to sound weird, but I stopped playing because of how good the art team is. 
---
Wait what?! How?! Why?! Let me explain...
---
When the game was in a content prime there was amazing art and great game mechanics and features. You could much more easily justify the cost of the skins and aesthetic (art asserts) items during that time because you could use them to play through the refreshed and still relevant content. Now, there is such a massive content drought combined with the fact that 99% of every single new mount, armor, weapon, etc, is all in the gem store. There is no more justifying looking cool if all it is for is to be badass or stylish for 20 minutes, realize there is nothing to do anymore and then log off. Now here is the point; it’s not ‘fun’ to see all these amazing new assets by the art team, have no way to play the game to get them (no saving gold to buy gems does not count), and then just pass on all or most of it. Now of course there are some little outliers to this view, but more or less in general, I think this is pretty spot on. The gem store has more content attention in it than the main game does for how positively it influences the overall world atm. I hope this can change.
---
&gt; You realize this game is built around manipulating you into spending money, right? 
---
While I am in complete agreement with the manipulation part, the spending is still up to you.
---
i agree with you except i was an LDS missionary myself and loved it lol
---
It's kinda true
---
You are right in that what we have with WvW is already quite balanced. Sure, there are small issues that could be fixed but aren't for a long time. But they are small compared to the size of all those maps and how balanced things are overall. I sometimes wonder how much time it must have taken to get it to that point.
---
You mean...like...[this](https://content.halocdn.com/media/Default/encyclopedia/vehicles/brute-chopper/brute-chopper-thumbnail-708x398-ad4c8578e8e447c9a8b1549508f19cf7.jpg)?

People were out of the office. It was a quiet 4th of July.  Until...
---
- Former Living World writer Jessica Price was talking about GW2 story structure on her Twitter.
---
- GW2 Partner streamer Deroir responded to her public tweets by critiquing the Living Story structure.  https://miro.medium.com/max/1266/1*BfLm9us8bk6lEpBAfc-REg.png
---
- She retweets him "Today in being a female game dev: allow me, a person who doesn't work with you, to tell you how to do your job."  https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QwPqM2C0d-fwchj7ZIdmBxaO9r4=/1400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11653341/sshot.png   
---
- Jessica Price was someone with over 10k+ followers, and by calling out Deroir with sexist accusations, her followers brigaded him.
---
- Deroir immediately retracts his comment and apologizes. https://twitter.com/DeroirGaming/status/1014561660340703232
---
- Jessica Price responds: "Thanks for trying to tell me what we do internally, my dude 9_9"  and "Untag me."
---
- Deroir once again apologizes, states that "You getting mad... instead of just replying I am wrong... is very disheartening to me... I'm sorry I offended you." https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dh1QdbRVAAAmvGk?format=jpg&amp;name=small
---
- Jessica Price doubles-down her comments directed at Deroir by alluding to him as a "rando asshat" https://twitter.com/delafina777/status/1014555719352213504?lang=en
---
- It devolves into a huge twitter shitstorm
---
- Fellow Dev Peter Fries steps in to defend Jessica Price stating "She never asked for your feedback." and mentions something about mansplaining.
---
- Jessica Price is called to speak with ArenaNet CEO Mike O'Brien. The details of their correspondence is unknown.
---
- Jessica Price and Peter Fries are fired
---
- Jessica Price visits gaming media and claims ArenaNet "Folded like a chair" by listening to subreddit criticism of her.
---
- \+ Bonus: Jessica Price leaks internal details about game's story. States development facts about LS4. Claims that LS4 was originally the end of GW2 until LS5 was announced.
---
I hope this was an accurate, brief timeline.
---
Hey so I'm somewhat new here, and after some brief research apparently the thief class has a bad rap? Is this in specific contexts? I'm more or less under the impression that if I'm a casual solo PvE player the game is designed to be playable regardless of class/build as long as it's at least average; I'd say I'm running an average Power D/D Build.
---
Also, after making sure I have Guild Banner boosts and some kind of food booster, after completing Queensdale I was around level 16 which is a little above its indicated level range (1-15), but having just finished Kessex Hills, I'm only level 23 and not 25? I did my best to upkeep the Guild Banner and food boosts and as far as I can remember, I did around the same amount of events on Kessex Hills as I did in Queensdale. Is this normal?
---
I'm currently just starting Brisban Wildlands to make sure I don't get stomped in Genderran Fields.
---
Also, is there much to do expansion wise if I'm only level 23? I have both expansions and as far as I can tell their gameplay doesn't seem to start until after level 80.
---
Thanks guys!
---
Really nice. Although I kind of expected the whole run, with all the snowballs being dodged through.
---
Love her!
---
I don't believe there is such a thing as a minute change for Anet.  Everything seems hard for them.
---
All classes are perfectly fine in open world, going power d/d like you said is a good choice for core thief open world. I know that there was a long period of time where thief wasn’t in the meta for raids or fractals, so that might be where you got that from, but thief is in a pretty good state now. It has a few different meta builds in raids. I’d recommend power daredevil as a solid class to play in raids and fractals.
---
It’s pretty normal for map completion to not perfectly align with your level range. You get a lot of exp from dynamic events, so you can do those as you go through the map if you want to pick up additional exp.
---
All expansion zones and content are lv80, so wait until lv80 to start looking into expansion content.
---
GW2 already redid the NPE and it was terrible. (In particular, it coincided with the Chinese release. Which makes me wonder if that influenced their decisions...)
---
This is going to sound tin-foil hat-y, but I think the NPE is done bad *on purpose* because they purposely want their playerbase to be bad at the game. To explain why would take essays long post, but it all comes down psychologically manipulative techniques discussed in "Let's Go Whaling" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNjI03CGkb4
---
&gt; It needs to stop with its casual pandering and story

Well, they are doubling down on it now. On top of the LS episodes now we are gonna get even more story with a different perspective on what they've called "Visions of the Past". The thing is if only they were good at story telling, I wouldn't mind, but they aren't and there are single player games out there with a far, far better story.
---
&gt; + Bonus: Over time, Jessica Price leaks internal details about game's story and development. States development facts about LS4. Claims that LS4 was originally the end of GW2 until LS5 was announced. Claims at one point that Mike O' said: "Maybe we should listen listen to the GamerGaters"
---
What? First time I hear that one. The rest is accurate though. I remember her taking most credits for LS4, calling it ‘her baby’ or something and that resources were limited for LS4 because the manpower was put on side projects but... I don’t remember her clearly ever saying it was the ‘end of GW2’.
---
I would love to, but I'm playing on 300+ ping, which makes it almost impossible to dodge the snowballs as I can't judge the hitbox of the snowballs. You can see how bad it is near the end of the run where I'm able to jump on the snowflakes even before they've technically spawned in
---
Oh neat, that's really cool and the colour design is a beauty.
---
&gt; What? First time I hear that one
---
She posted details here on her Twitter looooooong after she was fired.
---
I don't have time to dig out each claim. But you can find some on google.
---
My interpretation of this change is that they want me to go check the store constantly instead of simply informing me when the thing I am interested is available. I assume the purpose is to get more impulse buys.
---
I see. Guess I was confused for two reasons.  
---
1) That was in July 2018, as your nice timeline below shows.  
---
2) Mike O's interpretation of the situation and his reaction to her behavior may have aligned with opinions expressed here, that doesn't mean reddit drove the outcome. There's just no evidence to back up the language "ceded control of the studio" if this is the incident being referenced. And if it isn't, this take is even more bewildering to me.
---
If anything they refuse to listen to the reddit  community
---
i stoped doing all cool shit dodge jump years ago,bcs you can save  3 sec or lose 30.
---
GW2 sucks. Every other MMO sucks more though.
---
&gt; There's just no evidence to back up the language "ceded control of the studio" if this is the incident being referenced.
---
Well, with exception of the time Reddit told ANET to STOP putting mounts in RNG loot boxes,  the JP incident is the only time media has ever accused GW2 of "ceding control of the studio to Reddit".
---
This action is called "dog whistling". It's when they allude t an event or meaning without explicitly stating what it is.
---
Case in point (and not to get political) it's like when a nazi says "'they' won't replace us.",  the 'they' means Jews.
---
By the same logic, when game journos refer to ANET as "ceding control of the company to Reddit" they mean the JP incident.
---
It's called Dog Whistling.
---
For some reason this immediately made me think of a hamster ball or wheel... Except your character is in the ball running it around
---
Breaking news: For-profit companies exist to make money, more at 11.
---
:-(
---
And Quiznos!
---
Those are the people who aren't even playing the game anymore and actually visits this sorry excuse for a website.... only 328 even voted, that's just patheticly low for it to then "win". Then again, nothing I didn't expect, now let's see the reddit whiners upvote this post past those 328 voters to really show how sad this number is.
---
FFXIV has a dead world, cringy story(GW2's has the blessings of being skippable and at least having interesting situations, like being turned into a rabbit) bland races, inflexible class design, meaningless itemization, awful art and graphics (it look like a remastered PS2 game), and awful combat, though FFXIV combat works better for chewing through stupid amounts of HP in Damage Sponge DPS-race raid content.
---
She got fired from piazo when she did the same thing with pathfinder she was calling every sexist and the company and community right wing. The pathfinder community is pretty left btw.
---
Someone nominated it, but ceded that it didn’t really match the category.
---
Because reddit.
---
And all teh dev time they spent on this instead of a new expansion!
---
One thing you can do to save some time is get the effigy stuck on the bridge when he does his charge attack so he doesn't move around. You still have to deal with the first round of adds but can stealth through the second round. Another thing you can do to deal with the left over adds is blow your big skills, gg, then repeat because you have invuln for a couple of seconds afterwards.
---
I love how they all just say that, “Something feels...off,” with GW2.
---
This so perfectly encapsulates my feelings with it...  With every new content release it feels less and less magical, less and less fun, and less and less worth even bothering with.  But there’s no way to really articulate why...
---
Yeah...no... It's just that little blue shining that's the topic here...
---
Jessica Price is a garbage person who got everything she got coming to her. The fact Game Journos are actually defending her is disgusting. And the Gamergate boogieman. Again.
---
These people are a broken record. They are always the victim. They never make mistakes. They never bring any of this on themselves. Jessica Price made an ass of herself on twitter, showed herself to be unrepentantly bigoted and inflammatory for absolutely no reason and she got dropped for it.
---
Absolutely Zero sympathy and the fact this 'Journalist' has any tells me they have an agenda.
---
&gt;that doesn't mean reddit drove the outcome.
---
I mean, when an employee was hired with the knowledge she was very outspoken about social issues on twitter, and continues to do so while in your employment without much trouble, only to then be fired overnight because one particular tweet caused a Reddit uproar (while other tweets were much more unacceptable for someone to tweet out while being a public employee imo), there's is no denying that the Reddit stink had some hand in the descision to let her go. 
---
I hope the incident has been long enough ago that I will no longer be downvoted into the ground  for suggesting that although Price was absolutely in the wrong for her tweet, her and her colleague shouldn't have lost their livelihoods overnight just because this subreddit was astroturfed to hell and back.
---
Depends if you go for (personal) speedrun record or maximal gifts gain
---
If we're getting a wheel beetle skin I hope it's charr themed and not asura themed to be honest. Those charr vehicles are badass.
---
Apparently only 328 people voted on that shitty website, how sad is that. Think they topped their own "Biggest MMO website disappointment of 2019" with this one.
---
or WVWVW
---
I'm pretty sure an argument with you is a complete waste of time given these responses but for the sake of having fun with morons I'll go ahead and give this a shot
---
you said "art is dead", as if the games industry had no respect for art anymore and was focused on monetization, commercialism, basically prioritizing making a buck over a product with soul, quality, whatever.
---
You're wrong, obviously. I cited death stranding as an example of an arthouse game that isn't overmonetized or focused on sucking people's time away like games like gw2, fortnite, LoL, overwatch, etc. You, completely missing the point, said that the game was awful and was carried by kojima's name.
---
unfortunately for your argument, that has literally nothing to do with whether or not the game is art or not, and if nothing else proves my point. Kojima has garnered a reputation for artistic, aesthetically cohesive experiences dotted with wacky shit and options-rich experiences. He's also earned a reputation for extremely plot-heavy games with a shitload of cutscenes that are sometimes closer to films than video games. They operate in an entirely different space than a game like league or whatever. If people are buying a game based on kojima's name alone, there's an expectation that it's more of an arthouse game than not. He's an auteur. 
---
I only mentioned subjectivity to suggest that your opinion, regardless of its basis, isn't relevant to whether or not death stranding is art, or artistic. It undeniably is. People purchased it knowing that it would be. Many people were satisfied by it. Perhaps you weren't, but the fact of the matter is that there is a market for arthouse games. There are dozens of other examples in 2019 alone of successful arthouse games, but that one got the most press.
---
GW2's style isn't releasing more professions, but more elite specs.
---
Revenant was released because there was only 2 heavy armor professions, so they saw a gap there that could be filled. Now that they are a neat 3x3, there's no more gaps.
---
As for more elite specs, I see it possible, but unlikely at this time. Things would have to change for it to become more likely.
---
Claw?
---
Claiming talking to menis waste of time. Proceeds with posting 5 paragraphs. Nice.
---
I would absolutely love more WvW content.
---
However, in particular, I'd like a game mode that wasn't just "follow the tag and zerg"
---
I find it funny how the choice of pants aren't even iconic to GW2. They're just a generic pair of gemstore pants, and not even one of the iconic ones at that.
---
It looks like something you'd generic see in Walmart. Maybe that was their intention.
---
It doesn't. Saying "I refuse to have an opinion" is 1) either intellectually lazy or intellectually dishonest, and 2) a political position in and of itself, prioritizing smaller, more personal concerns over larger, more conventionally "political" national ones. Politics is a non-discipline, and is largely about organizing society. If you're a part of society, or have every been a part of society, you have political opinions. You may not have done the legwork to suss them out, but they exist.
---
Wow you really think winnie the pooh of beijin cares about what people write about him here :)
---
Are you new to the game? Chak egg sac doesnt exist in TP because of how rare it is, there are 10+ buy orders of 10k gold that will likely never be fulfilled.
---
It actually put gw2 on the front page. Thousands of non players were stumbling into the threads and employees of other studios chimed in on the situation too. It went viral fast. MO had to do something.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTTcGIzeJwA
---
People like Gaile Gray, who'd given years of service and making money, were tossed aside to streamline profits. It's an incredibly shitty way to treat staff. 
---
The game had made sales figures similar to 2017 (which obviously saw the release of PoF) and there was no need for it.
---
Thanks for this. I've been doing some research into Daredevil and it does seem to fit my playstyle more than Deadeye. Though, when it does come to Daredevil, do I have to use the staff? Of course I haven't tried it out yet so I can't know whether I'll like it but I feel like if I play D/D until level 80 and I get Daredevil, I'll suddenly need to relearn an entire kit again. Sure, it's not a big deal, but what if I want to stick to D/D? Would I be 'wasting' Daredevil's Staff potential?
---
Some missing bullet points:
---
1. Deroir wasn't just a "rando asshat". He is a GW2 streamer with an in-game npc named after him as a sign of respect from Arenanet.
---
2. Jessica Price also lashed out at many other players who came to his defence.
---
[removed]
---
Gaile left on her own. Thankfully. She hurt this game's pr more than anything else in 7 years.
---
You're only red again the following week if you lose the matchup in T5, in all other tiers if you lose the matchup and drop, you will be green the following matchup, so your post only applies to one server.
---
Nah mate, you're overcomplicating things.
---
&gt;The icon has been moved to the end of the bar because of some issue that came up during R&amp;D.
---
&gt;why gw2taco draws over the new TP icon. Which lets us suspect that the new icon isn't really drawn by the game itself, but by the TP app. If that's true, they had to spend resources implementing this.
---
Given these circumstances, it's pretty easy to explain. The newer TP, along with a few other UI bits in GW2 are web-based, rendered by "CoherentUI" in a similar vein to Panorama in Valve's Source2 engine.
---
As such, it'd be pretty easy to handle the various states the icon can be in, and the glow is as trivial as testing against the lastplayed timestamp. No fucking around with websockets or some other guff needed.
---
I mean to be totally honest I'm not totally in the loop as to all of the ins and outs of specific individuals; I recognise the names from GW1 when I was more actively playing.
---
I love both games and still do play them, but it doesn't stop the fact that they were made to do a bad thing to (at least some) loyal and dedicated staff. This industry is really poorly unionised and I don't think it is a bad thing to express a bit of solidarity with those made needlessly redundant. I've been there myself and it is brutal.
---
This is still going LMAO !
---
They got compensation. Its usa, not outskirts of eastern europe. They will find jobs (or already did). It happened almost a year ago, enough of overly dramatized compassion. Those people dont even know you exist.
---
Lol cheer up man
---
D/D daredevil will do less damage than staff but you can stick with it if you end up not liking staff. In general if you want to stick with D/D, deadeye is actually a really good option for that, as your dagger1 stealth attack gets a nice upgrade.
---
Staff daredevil took a while for me to learn (for me, it was changing my mindset from stealthing through enemy attacks to instead dodge all enemy attacks) and it personally didn’t “click” for me until I finished the traitline and got the upgraded dodge. Three dodges + evade frames in your staff3 and staff5 make you virtually untouchable once you get comfortable and learn how to evade everything. Would definitely recommend giving it a try for a while, its a very fluid and unique style of gameplay.
---
I think you are making an assumption that because red trucks with blue flashing lights can be seen near fires, those trucks must cause them. 
---
It wasn't about Reddit per se. It was the first (and the last) time JP explicitly shat on Anet's customer base. Could not have possibly gone well for her.
---
I'm still disappointed over that presentation they hyped to hell and back for over a month. With that much hype building it should have been at the very least an acknowledgement of a future expansion on the way (even if it were 1-2 years away).
---
Instead we got a half hour talk about living world that didn't even attempt to justify the claims that it could deliver expansion level content and then 15m on merchandising.
---
Watching the presentation live meant getting up at 4am for me so I was all onboard for the hype train to take me away but instead it just derailed.
---
More like [Fire Salamander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_salamander). It even fits the default colors.
---
**Fire salamander**
---
The fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) is possibly the best-known salamander species in Europe.
---
It is black with yellow spots or stripes to a varying degree; some specimens can be nearly completely black while on others the yellow is dominant. Shades of red and orange may sometimes appear, either replacing or mixing with the yellow according to subspecies. Fire salamanders can have a very long lifespan; one specimen lived for more than 50 years in Museum Koenig, a German natural history museum.
---
As a WvW player, fuck alliances.
---
Just SOME balance and SOME rewards would make me happy at this point.
---
yea...no.  Most other big MMOs like ESO, WoW, FFXIV and others can run at 60+ FPS on high settings, have way more content releases, better balance, better in game rewards and a whole lot more.  GW2 might have the better open world but that's about it and it's not saying much.  Better combat?  That's even questionable.  If you are playing for what GW2 does better than other MMOs, open world, then it doesn't matter one bit about combat since all you need to do is press 1 to succeed.  Story content?  GW2's story and characters are shallow, forgetful and poorly written compared to most other MMOs.  The 3 other MMOs I mentioned release more story content with better written stories than GW2.
---
I guess if you play GW2 purely for open world or buying cash shop items then it's better?  Maybe?
---
Things added into a game for you to purchase/unlock in it are still content by definition, it's not just the things you specifically want the world "content" to mean alone
---
on of them is even a leggings design that is based on a gemstore armor design, which in turn is a fancy glowy version of a core in-game desing. better yet, they had to remake that set because the original iteration was based on human t3, which meant you could buy a (at the time) far cheaper version of not-racial locked cultural armor on the gemstore.
---
it isn't all that relevant, but a fun little story nonetheless.
---
Based on what we call MMOs nowadays F76 is definitely an mmo as sad as it is.
---
Blizzard is a company and not a game ffs
---
The gemstore is highlighted and shiny so you have to click on it and see all the new overpriced stuff.  
---
It has the same effects as ads do or a discord notification on your favourite server.
---
&gt;decline of community support for this project
---
Aww shame to hear that.  I still love LB, even helped get it Whitelisted on Addaware when that program started to claim it was a threat last month!
---
Now if only I could solve the problem of 1.9.3 always setting my Volume to MAX and killing my ears whenever I launch a client.
---
Because staying in tune with the largest community in your game is caving, time for anet to go back making random shit no one asked for.
---
We don't know , maybe ?
---
The amount of people getting personally hurt by this is insane.
---
tl;dr: Choosing Flamekissed was a horrible idea.
---
Man, someone in ANET marketing has really lost their marbles. I don't want to belittle someone's education, but I pity the fact someone spent years in college studying business, only to produce cringe like Flamekissed Pants and Tyria Taxi.  
---
I'm sure that the people who worked hard and persevered in school can do better than this, and I'd like to see them do better.
---
I mean, it can't be worse than poe currently is. So at the very least it won't be the worst ARPG on the market.
---
DO A BARREL ROLL!
---
Fine. "Do you guys have foooones" is a lot more iconic
---
Everything is politics, regardless of your narrow opinion.
---
Uhhh.. I didn't see the OP but I'm gonna say that he was being sarcastic...
---
FFXIV is deep cave, kek. OMEGALUL
---
As long as WvW, and level capped dungeons are moribund, GW2 is dead to me.
---
You should look at the roadmap for 2020 and the interview with nike on mighty teapot's channel, raids aren't being developed, strike missions are replacing raids.
---
well deserved
---
I wish that gate to the Dominion of Winds became playable so that it would open.
---
So then why do so many companies use it for brownie points? Why is it ok for them to put pride flags in their logos and spout about how progressive they are during pride month, and then not a freaking day after pride month is over, they're back to acting like nothing has changed?
---
It shouldn't be political, but it is.
---
You don't need to use the weapon for an elite specialization, though Staff is a very good weapon and you should at least try it out.
---
If you want to stick with your daggers no matter what, then you might actually be better off trying Deadeye, as dual daggers remains the preferred weapon for that specialization.
---
And just to note so you don't necessarily need to wait a long time to find out, since you own the expansions, you can try out both Daredevil and Deadeye right now by entering the PvP lobby (click the crossed swords at the top of the screen) and equipping them there.  There'll be training dummies and NPCs within the lobby that you can practice against.  You'll need to bring a staff if you want to try out those new moves, but you can get a cheap one as a drop somewhere!
---
Have you tried hitting it with your point stick for a really long time?
---
&gt;That seems like super scam/phishing prone.
---
Only for idiots. I assume this means you're one OMEGALUL
---
2020 better? lol most of us are leaving for New World.
---
Just wait until you see the new glider, outfit and weapon set coming next week.
---
Boy I can't wait to see how people are gonna react.
---
Who here remembers Sanderinoa? I was wondering what a current gen Mesmer solo build would look like.
---
Triumphant hero is also ascended not exotic is can be upgraded to legy armor.
---
I’m new to PC gaming as of this holiday season and was thinking about getting into GW2. Is this the type of content one would expect for quarterly releases/updates?
---
Oh right, you can get it as ascended or just the skin for a cheaper price, I'll edit. Thabjs
---
Exactly. it's unreasonable to expect MMO content from a MMO developer. Gimme my dressup game instead so I can afk for 2 hours a day showing off my 20 auras.
---
There's one: don't do that and get sneak-killed before you get your bearings.
---
7 steps of grief:
---
Step 3: Anger and Bargaining
---
GW2's design does promote other players almost everywhere other than in story instances. I think the real loss is that after HoT's negative reception the difficulty of dynamic events and other open world content went mostly back to "111111", in which case the other players don't truly matter.
---
"Ackchyually"
---
&gt; I see players with 100 mastery points at freezie auto attacking from range with their core classes.
---
What if I'm not a fan of either of the elite specs for a class? Neither of Warrior's appeals to me. By your logic I should be forced to run one, even though I don't like either, on that character just because they exist. If I'm not running any content that needs one why should I force myself to use something that I dislike?
---
It's a 3D printer. Creality Ender-3 pro and material is PLA. Colors are acrylic paint.
---
Bree Royce has a hate boner for Reddit... while reading Reddit basically every day to find something new to hate on.
---
I think 2019 was not friendly to Gw2 .. I hope 2020 brings the good stuff
---
Thank god.
---
So, let me see if I follow your argument. This guy says Anet let reddit run their company earlier on. The only real example of this was from JP. So, I take exception to him defending JP. You claim I can't know it's about JP, so I shouldn't say anything about it. I admit the possibility, however slim, that he isn't talking about JP and am quite willing to walkback what I said if he wasn't. That makes me the new SJW.
---
That doesn't make a lot of sense. By that logic, I can't call him out for defending JP because, hey, maybe he wasn't. But then can't I call you out for defending him while also being a Chapo? Or is that still not acceptable? Because I know you're defending him. So...yea, now I'm just confused.
---
&gt; The Blizzard incident should be the top of the list. Even their employees staged a walk out in protest of the decision. Members of the US Senate and Congress wrote a letter to Blizzard. But hey, the GW2 Living Story isn't living up to your hype so let's all focus on that.
---
That incident was a PR suicide, not a game related one. I'm all for the backlash they got for it, but it doesn't belong in the same category as individual games. Kind of makes it a non-argument, as it drowns out every point of criticism for everything in the broad genre - "Well yes we fucked you guys over, but look at Blizzard they were even worse!".
---
WoW did take a hit from it, but that wasn't WoW's fault as a game. GW2 is going downhill because there's nothing coming to the game, not because of outside factors.
---
As for the other titles, GW2 was ahead with 29% before I posted the article here, so it's not just Reddits doing.
---
I prefer to do the hunting.
---
&gt;That makes me the new SJW.
---
Yes. Getting outraged over something you're not even sure is true is behavior that SJWs got shit for.
---
I've never posted on Chapo. More paranoia. More getting angry about something you think is true before even verifying if it's true.
---
Dreamwalker Dagger Skin, which is new, wasn't highlighted. Neither was the Snowflake Gobbler Package, unless new hightlighted items "overwrite" old ones (I just checked on an alt that hasn't been logged in after the new items were added)
---
No returning items are highlighted as "featured" items.
---
Iirc we had no free stuff since this feature was added, so we'll have to wwait for that, but why would they do that if they don't even highlight all the new stuff
---
So... Yeah, yes, they decide which items are "featured" items, which are not, and it's not tied to items being new. Can't confirm the free part yet, so gotta wait for that.
---
Like, the creators? Oh wait.
---
I bet they are just running away from home every Christmas... I mean which child doesn't want to get thousands over thousands of gifts?
---
good
---
lol
---
I can't think of any free items they've given out I even cared about...
---
Will not happen, when NCsoft makes it next thing gw will end like city of heros belive me. NCSoft did the Layoffs not anet by themself.
---
I knew which gif it is before I clicked it.
---
anet should just merge half of the servers ... easier and faster to do
---
MOP writes the biggest junk of an article and GW2 sub reddit takes the bait , amazing :D
---
Gw2 is indeed a dying game but we chose to play a game without any subs (which is really nice). You guys have to realise that they only make money from micro transactions which is less consistent money than subs and without money there will not be any content added to the game because developpers costs a lot. So for me, GW2 is dying and it’s because there’s less people playing and therefore less players buy mtx! I love this game but it was meant to be like this.
---
Don't see why you'd care about running something solo (dungeons, fractals) that is farm content for about 6 years now. 
---
Sure as a waste of time and test of strengh maybe... would be nice if you actually get something for it.
---
Its just that I'm allready running the usual fractal dailys and am sick of them, I really don't want to spend more time inside them - just get it over with.
---
They should release new ones tho, dungeons and raids...
---
Totally remember that now.  It's been a while.
---
The incident with Deroir wasn't even her first incident with an Annet partner, she went off on Jebro who said he liked Infinity War in reply to a tweet of hers saying she disliked the movie (he didn't know what he was getting into I guess lol) and another time with MMOInks though granted in that case I think Inks was replying to something he shouldn't of in the first place.
---
A survival game is gonna take alot of players from an mmo?
---
Mike O' said: "Maybe we should listen to the GamerGaters"
---
Sounds like the most non Mike O' thing ive ever heard though I could be wrong.
---
I never really farmed the jumping puzzle here as I hate them like the pest but the most monotonous farm I can endure is the labyrinth at  Halloween. The longest I farmed there without a break was 2 hours and by then my brain was absolutely mushy.
---
Earliest would be White wolf with WoD iirc but Paizo is high on the list.
---
.......that's concept art, not his model.
---
You aren't the first to do this and I'm sure you won't be the last one, but do try to THINK a bit before doing these comparisons.
---
I don't think it says that the players should be bad at the game. Just that the game probably shouldn't be too skill based.
---
&gt; falt earth wiki 
---
Bonus point if it is spelled like that exactly.
---
I've crafted all my ascended items, so I'm all geared out. Is there even a reason for me to raid?
---
The trailer's shadow is very similar to the concept art.
---
Ok bye.
---
And yet you cheered about this change because you missed free items over the years as if they made a public announcement on how they're going to use this feature for that. Don't ignore that part.
---
328 Is not publicity. It is nothing. And I am sure most of those 328 came for here after the article was linked. Such a stupid bait
---
that depends on your definition of playing.
---
 my 4 years old acer peace of shit can run it but not above 20 fps, 1.5 min load time to any populated area and about 10 seconds to actually mount up on a beetle in DR right now...
---
Ok, whatever you say.
---
Her narrative is a false one built around people being guilted into not calling her on her shit. Of course it feeds it. 
---
She takes legit concerns like diversity and turns them toxic by twisting everything, creating boogie men in whatever place doesn't agree with her. 
---
Right out of a cannon I say. Out of the industry. Sadly, in today's world that seems less and less likely.
---
Would the male gates have a drawbridge as a...useful tool for reproduction?
---
Nah they reproduce similar to sylvari: the Pale Gate
