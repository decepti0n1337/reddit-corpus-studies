I am unable to find a group for dungeon since I play off hours on weekdays. I was wondering if doing level appropriate hearts will yield the same result and is it viable? I’ll definitely hop on in any dungeon group if I see one but can hearts carry me till level 80? 
---
---
---
&gt;Tornado has a big ass indicator and you can move out of its range very easily while staying in melee range still 
---

---
Yup, thats the theory. Ask Slippery Slope, Social awkwardness and hamstrung how much that theory holds up in non-T1 fracs.
---
&gt;or others can break its bar for you to get released
---
Try getting others to do that in Pugs. Also, depending on your position and who's left, that isn't all that easy in the timeframe given if you're not a CC heavy build.
---
But then how's he going to manipulate that chode-mouse to the right?! He needs 2 hands on keyboard, 3rd on chode-mouse! It's the winners choice!
---
But Mesmer is Gw2 prized child. Surely they'll get better treatment than the others 
---
They usually have patch day on tuesdays. Also if there is a bigger patch out there is often extra bug fixes. But Tuesdays should be the biggest change. Mind though it do happen sometimes that there is no patch at all one week.
---
Sure, but mirage can be fixed. I just find numbers wrong with mirage.
---
Meanwhile I think chrono is inherently broken in its core.
---
It's just opinion. But I do enjoy the idea that people downvoted me for saying what I dislike, in a thread about classes that people dislike. :^)
---
No fixed time for PVE map resets. Map instances are created/closed based on population so if Snowden Drifts is quiet but not completely empty then one instance may last a very long time and you'll just keep getting the same instance each time. If there is a "Daily Snowden Drifts Event Completer" then that'll make it a lot busier though.
---
If you know there is a patch coming then logging in straight after a patch will guarantee a fresh map instance. 
---
If you mean the announcement that was announced last week on twitch? Yeah that just got announced on twitch today that it's been put back 'til next week due to the bad weather the anet office has been having this week. Another week we wait... choo choo :(

This is why you dont "announce" announcements.
---
You build hype. Which sounds good at face value. But if you build too much hype you can never live up to expectations, and when you fall flat. Oh boy do you fall hard.
---
Even more saddening when you see the ambient armadillo kobs in-game that are much more accurate to an actual armadillo. Don't get me wrong, I love the skin, but I don't love the fact that it's clearly not an armadillo. Pangolin Petey is best Petey though!
---
The fact that he was playing a Scourge was funny to me. 
---
God bless you, you dumbass bot. Very fitting. 
---
this isn't true wtf are you talking about
---
Yeah, yeah we know. It's not these devs fault. Hell they're all great people.
---
Still people can be frustrated, especially because it's wvw announcement. You know we get like 1 per year and even that is delayed...
---
Than we get to the announcement size. Is it going to be event week, which in my mind doesn't require some special announcement to make.
---
Also actual content is important. Is it mounts? That pretty much every WvW player hates to even think about.
---
With track record that ANet has for good WvW changes, all kinds of shit can happen, which fuels everything even more.
---
I like huge maps with lots of verticality because I love flying on my griffon, plus I really like fantasy depictions of deserts, so a lot of the PoF and LW4 zones are my favorite places to just be in.
---
I never liked tangled depths because of how frustratingly convoluted the map is, plus all the annoying chak just make navigating around tedious.
---
Also speaking of not bad, just boring zones. I have played around 600 hours and did not know that fields of ruin existed until recently I decided might as well complete the other 2 orders' quest lines (Order of Whispers 4 life). 
---
change my mind: engineer is just a boring elementalist 
---
Elementalist. How can a class feel so weak yet be so good at the same time?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It's like constantly starving for cooldowns and spamming shit together asap just to fart some numbers that not only are not necessary at all but are also half as helpful as consistent dps/support provided by other classes.
---
Probably because they need 10 random people to sign off on the announcement, didn't get approval, and 2 of the signors stayed home due to bad weather and ignored all communication.
---
They make so few announcements about this game they forgot how to do them. Get ur shit together Anet.

And thanks! I &lt;3 Celestial gear so much. it's potential is severely underrated in today's meta. Might is much more plentiful than the days of d/d cele ele years ago. just battle &amp; strength sigil are capable of pulling 15+ might.
---
Another thing I love about celestial gear &amp; ele, is the might boon fits in almost what's a perfect storm. I'll elaborate with an example:
---
A hammer warrior has 25 might, He benefits from 750 power &amp; condition damage, however - his weapons have no condition damage, so this 750 condi damage is essentially void.
---
A cele D/D weaver has 25 might, he suddenly has the offensive stats of a guy in full marauders (2900-3000 power), with 1400-1500 condition damage to boot. Might has an amplified effect on cele builds by enhancing your offensive stats by an \*effective\* 1500 stat points, vs a power build really only benefiting from 750 power.
---
DirectX 12.
---
They said on the stream, it's not going to be announced during regular weekly WvW streams. Ergo, it's going to be announced on Tuesday. Ergo, it was supposed to be announced 2 days ago and for some reason they didn't bother to let us know they fucked up somehow and need to delay. There's something fishy about this whole thing.
---
What's there to defend? Their office was closed for snow. 
---
What I mean is this: the devs casually said there would be an announcement. That's communication which is what we want. Then the office gets snowed over and work is closed. That delays things. 
---
When they explain it's behind because of weather everyone loses their mind and tears them a new one. If you really want more communication you have to accept that you will be seeing more of the internal process, which changes a lot. This happens at every studio. If all you will accept is absolute certainty and nothing else will do, I don't know what to tell you. Welcome to the real world where things don't always go as planned.
---
 
---
Sounds like we will have to wait a whole 4 days to hear something. God forbid, right?
---
I've been having lots of dc issues and lagging recently.
---
We don't speak about Golem Week.
---
Did nobody clip this announcement or what?
---
My friend just told me that she's been lagging and DC-ing left and right today too.  I haven't DC'ed but I've been lagging/freezing like crazy.
---
&gt;Slippery makes it easier actually, since if you evade even at the last milisecond you slide away from it and get out of its range.
---
Slippery does however, not make it easier if you slide into it against your camera angle.
---
&gt;way you talk bullshit (talking as if what, i do T1s?)
---
You didn't get the point of this thread.
---
This is a thread about dispaclement abilities that offer no or very limited counterability in the form of stunbreaks, stability and condition cleanses. Tornado in non T1 fractals can have its intial design counters counteracted more or less strongly, and once you actually get trapped inside it, it very much falls into the same category, as neither stunbreak nor condicleanse stops you from going down the cliff. 
---
This is not a thread about how much these things make encounters a problem. This is purely about the design of the ability. And of all the mentioned abilities, this is the only one that actually fully kills you, which makes it one of the worst offenders designwise.
---
&gt;I do T4+CMs everyday with my group [...]and/or the group you were in was simply bad if those tornadoes were ever a problem for you since deepstone was introduced because i did every deepstone so far and they never were
---
congrats. Not only did you miss the fact that your group probably has more communication than the average PUG, you also missed that all of the instabilities I mentioned exist for barely more than a month so that snippet is pointless.
---
&gt;The only problem with tornadoes is that they require ranged CC since going in melee sucks you in too.
---
Ok. Now if I play in a PUG and don't have a static with fix roles, and get a team of Reaper, Staff Mirage, Druid, PDaredevil and Sup Chrono. If the Chrono gets caught the best bet for "Ranged CC" is hoping the Druid has Avatar up and Reaper Warhorn4. But sure, because you and your static never had a problem with it, anybody that might have a problem with this design is just bad. Because I play in a professional Orchestra and we've never had a problem with fully staffing our roles and playing hard pieces on sightread, anybody who can't is just bad. 
---
Yea it is option. But another option is to try something to change what you dislike. And complaining is one way :D
---
Mesmer.  and Ele.
---
Ele because its too complicated for me.  Mesmer because i have never had any interest in it from a design or fluff standpoint.

Only 15?  [This pic](https://i.imgur.com/Z94XOAI.jpg) was taken last week.. It's snowed at least 3 times since then.  And no I don't live near them, but It's been a pretty snow heavy year for me.
---
Don´t those guys have phones?
---
Grow up.  It's been *fucking* cold in the mid-west.  We're not talking normal cold.  [Seattle has gotten more snow this month than it has in **50** years.](https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/snowiest-february-in-more-than-100-years-continues-for-seattle-as-northwest-slammed-with-snow-again/70007422) 
---
I mean, I get people being upset that news they are looking forward to is getting delayed.
---
Now, I dont live in Seattle, and I'm USED to driving in "a bit of snow", but I'm going to come to the defence of anet here, and im preparing for the downvotes.
---
The company I work for has a site about an hour north of Seattle.  That site, has been closed due to weather.  Mind you, it takes this company a LOT to shut down a site.  When they do, people lose pay, it adds workload to everyone else, it's a huge mess.  That's why they dont do it unless it's really necessary.  I'm going to imagine it's the same for anet.
---
Given the INCREEIBLY hilly terrain in Seattle, adding the fact that most people in the area dont know how to drive in snow, and adding even further that the snow they are getting in the area is abnormally high... it makes sense.
---
Again.  I know it sucks.  But a company potentially putting their workers lives on the line so you can get news is not only bad business practice, it looks bad from a PR standpoint.
---
It's just a week, be patient until then.  Its lot like the news was straight up cancelled.
---
It's an announcement. An. ANNOUNCEMENT. If an announcement is being delayed the thing that is being announced is not going to be delayed.
---
....announcement.
---
I didn't realize until now that the images of [Zhaitan, Mordremoth and Balthazar](https://youtu.be/emSYUKA0-NQ) appear when Kralkatorrik charges that massive attack. 
---
Those were legends! That's freaking Revenant magic! 
---
This guy just didn't use the magic it got from them, it used that power to channel their legends from the mists and merge them into one attack!
---
Where the hell did he learn to do that?
---
Deadeye is the most thematically accurate.
---
Warrior can be played like a sniper too but more accurately, a soldier like profession which can swap between ranged and melee. 
---
Longbow Ranger is also a sniper style profession.
---
The final one which can be played as a sniper but feels more like an RPG is the Power Mesmer using GS, whivh has the potential to utterly destroy a couple of enemies if they managed to get lucky on them with all their skills.
---
its content on a webpage, not a livestream from a studio.  
---
having content ready to be released on button press, even manageable through homeoffice is standard today.

if its done right the content of said post is already finished since days and just needs to be shipped. thats something you can do from far.
---
And you show your ability to read is just as bad as your the logic you apply to this conversation.
---
&gt;Now if I play in a PUG and don't have a static with fix roles,
---
If only i mentioned this in the same comment you replied to:
---
&gt;And sure, pugs don't cc blabla but if we thought of groups that dont play as a group to design anything in MMOs you'd have living story level shit everywhere where you could go afk and NPCs clear everything for you.
---
I didn't miss the point of this thread. Here is something you seem to have missed:
---
&gt;You have a lot of answers to these things - **dodging** or blocking or packing some Stability to avoid them
---
and 
---
&gt;Now, does this system have a place? Yes, but not in combat until ANet can find a way to implement it with sound game design and counterplay options
---
Which tornado does pretty nicely.
---
Just because it is a thread that raises valid arguments about something doesn't mean you can throw everything you personally dislike into the mix. Deepstone tornado is fine, especially since the big ass indicator. If they make it so you can melee cc it (maybe only pulls you in for first 2-3 seconds then only pulls players that were already pulled) it'd be perfect. There are many other things in the game where it is not perfect but it is in a good spot, not necessarily same as some of things they mention.
---
Have a nice day.

Good! With that kind of attitude and mentality, you deserve "a big Fuck You".

I mean, all? No. If i expect ppl to read a very basic conversation of 4 comments in total. Lol.

Well thats your opinion my dude, I find it quite enjoyable myself :)
---
Oh no, not at all. They're just not as aware of them. Some of the best charr art is made by furry artists.
---
I'm surprised that came off as infatuation, but ok. I mean, it's *bonkers* that they had to delay an announcement because of weather, but people commenting about the development being delayed seemed to be missing the thread.
---
I wish I could say I was surprised, or give them the benefit of the doubt that this would mean a better announcement worth waiting for, but no, you're right - there are some big problems, and communication's always been one of them.
---
The stupid thing about this is that, *if* someone just got held up by the weather, that's a clear sign they have no internal Plan B system for communications of any kind, so far as I'm concerned - no briefing across multiple people, and no "Hit by a bus" strategy either.

Type " change device installation settings " in your search turn that off. Uninstall your graphic driver (and physx if needed), go to your gpu manufacturer, and re download your GPU driver. I know on nvidia you can click custom and clean install with just the gpu driver and physx.

Every single time windows has a major update they switch back on device installation settings and download another driver *for you* that breaks your computer. Windows 10 in a nutshell.

To put it bluntly: I don't know you, you're  not my friend. I don't care enough to comb through all your possible comments before replying. 
---
Now if you follow the chain of threads, you'll see other posters replying to you about chain CC as well. This proves my point. 
---
You need to read downthread, they must have some form of online and remote access, some snow should not stop that.
---
You're just a horrible person. In the last 2 weeks, they've already had more snow than any complete February in the last 70 years. Schools are closed and many residential streets still haven't been plowed. Because of this, they delayed *an announcement*. Not a patch. Not new features. Just **AN ANNOUNCEMENT**.
---
Today's T4 fire birds on Mai Trin were quite interesting, they crushed my party's soul.
---
Exactly. They've been asked today on the stream if the announcement is going to be on the stream next week, they said no, it is not. Ergo, it'll be on Tuesday. Ergo, it was supposed to be up 2 days ago, so they had plenty of time to tell us "Sorry, the announcement is delayed due to bad weather." You don't need full company in the office to release an article (unless whatever feature it'll be, it'll be implemented on the same time?).
---
You could just play GW1 if it's so awful for you ;)
---
Your point is..that ppl on reddit don't really care for the whole thing just like to read a few sentences and make up their mind? Like people not reading more than the titles?

I think stealthing also shouldn't untarget them, you shouldn't be able to see any info like HP or condis/boons when they are stealthed but unless you change targets yourself then they should still be your target when they become visible again.

In the case of the swirly bosses, yes.  Their swirly attacks occur are pre-set intervals, the first one at 75% health remaining, the second one at 25% health remaining.  Experienced players should know when the attacks are coming and be ready with their CC counters.
---
Of course, I bet most players are unobservant enough that they didn't even know that the tornado comes at set intervals of health...
---
Yeah, I mean, how hard is that?
---
There must be something more than just a blog post though, so I guess they want to show it to the press and the content creators first, so they can do their own previews.
---
Anet: we wanted to announce that WvW will get Birds and Slick Terrain instabilities but some users, _ungreatful pigs_, seem to be upset about this wonderful way to make content less stale and more engaging.
---
We're now sulking in the corner...er... considering alternatives. 
---
I made every class profession, can you guess what the last one was? Yep engi.

Coming from elementalist, i thought id like engi as much as i do ele, boy was i wrong.

Somehow making it a Holosmith made it more fun with lazer beams and light energy power. The base engi just suuck
---
Sadly, I think this is going to be an ongoing trend *in the industry* which doesn't say good things in general.
---
I haven't seen the stream, but a comment like that is *right* on the heels of Blizz with the "Don't you guys have phones?" comment. There's a pattern of increasing (pick one: indignity, entitlement, tonedeafness) that's just not healthy.
---
As much as people claim to hate controlled PR, there's still some wisdom in making sure your public information releases come from a deft hand. I've never been convinced about ANet's, and people are right when they say it's getting worse.
---
MFW they planned to introduce the new fractal instabilities to WvW too.
---
*Screaming intensifies*
---
Is that supposed to be a lot of snow?
---
Nothing at all to do with the massive amounts of snow that the Seattle area hasn't seen in like 30 years, and people not being able to get to work for the last week. Take a look at some Seattle News.

Alright since apparently I have to explain this to you:
---
Bursty != Have high burst. If someone does a constant 100k dps they have a higher burst than every other class, despite their dps being constant.
---
Literally none of the things you're talking about have I claimed.
---
Don't bother replying, because again you're ignoring the point (sword holo being worse than rifle due to less burst) just to be a pedantic asshole.
---
&gt;If only i mentioned this in the same comment you replied to:
---
Apples and oranges. You don't need to deal in extremes. Make stability not get you tornadoed, still not "living story level shit". Don't make Tornado fully kill you, still not "living story level shit".
---
&gt;I didn't miss the point of this thread. Here is something you seem to have missed:
---
&gt;You have a lot of answers to these things - dodging or blocking or packing some Stability to avoid them
---
Wrong point. Dodging as in dodge ***out*** of the mechanic, not dodge the mechanic alltogether. Otherwise the same would be true for the cited sandswept isles tornadoes, because you could technically just stay out of range entirely and kill the elementals with ranged weapons. 
---
&gt;Which tornado does pretty nicely.
---
Again, IN MECHANIC counterplay options. Of which tornado has none for you and barely one for your teammates. And also again, I didn't say tornado was crippling the encounter, I say it's a bad mechanic whose only saving grace is that "big ass indicator". Istan Champ whirl is also plently telegraphed, doesn't mean the mechanic isn't still bad. 
---
&gt;Just because it is a thread that raises valid arguments about something doesn't mean you can throw everything you personally dislike into the mix. 
---
Just because you're making an ad personam argument doesn't mean your point is any more objectively valid. The fact that failing Tornado is more punishing than failing the platforms on the final boss eventhough both are plenty telegraphed says a lot. The fact that Reactor final boss is even more telegraphed AND gives you a safe zone special ability because failing the mechanic fully kills you, says even more.
---
Dude, this "bad weather" in Seattle is literally one of the biggest snowstorms they've experienced in nearly a *century*. Seattle isn't used to this kind of shit.
---
Your shitty WvW announcement got delayed because of a record-breaking snowstorm. People like you are the reason Anet wants to wait until the last fucking second to announce anything.
---
so you have no idea what burst dps vs sustained dps is, got it
---
Huh?
---
Ranger is my main, primarily condi Soulbeast. I play on high latency (350ms) and this is the most forgiving class. No problem supporting with a boon druid either (done it in CMs). 
---
Power Soulbeast on the other hand, I can't get into it. I find my high latency makes it hard to land bursts. It makes GS usage clunky and frustrating. 
---
I love playing as a bunker Druid in PvP. My bunker druid uses LB and Sword/Warhorn so no GS there. No problem. I main Core Guard in PvP with Druid as my secondary class. I was high Gold3, a win or two away from Platinum before completing The Ascension and taking a break from the game mode.

GW2 is only "grindy as hell" for certain aspects of fashion wars 2 and extremely rare achievements. In terms of gearing, it is EXTREMELY relaxed.
---
I feel personally attacked. But I also don't post character mashup screenshots, so...
---
&gt;It's t4 guys let us have some difficulty!
---
Except the new instabilites aren't difficult. They're *annoying*. The advertised "counters" to the instabilities are garbage through and through.
---
You don't seem to understand that the high-end Fractal players *want* difficulty. They don't want *tedium*, which is what instabilities have always been and continue to be. The reason so many people want them removed is because if you remove them you can make Fractals inherently more challenging by introducing meaningful mechanics instead of creating an abomination of an instability like Slippery Slope and calling that a mechanic that "alters your playstyle." For example: Slippery Slope doesn't change your playstyle at all. The "counter" also does nothing. You will want Stability in the exact same places where you would want it before and extending it's duration does not counter the instability's mechanic, which is, in my opinion, poor design and why I dislike the instability. If Stability prevented you from sliding, then you suddenly have a huge incentive to want to have more Stability.
---
I am a firm believer that instabilities should be unique to each Fractal. This way, Anet can modify *specific mechanics* of each Fractal and give us a meaningful and logical way to adapt to each individual Fractal and it's associated instabilities. Instead of giving us a universal set of instabilities, give us 2-3 unique instabilities for each Fractal that can be toggled on or off and give you additional rewards if you complete the Fractal with them on. This will inherently make content like Challenge Motes more difficult as you could introduce unique rewards for clearing the CMs with all instabilities active.
---
The current instabilites are a mixed bag. Some of them are decent, some of them never should've left the testing phase. Specific combinations on specific Fractals are absolutely horrific. The fact of the matter is that we're never going to have inherently difficult content in this game, and this can be easily demonstrated by the lack of flavor that Challenge Motes introduce to raids. Anet does this *intentionally*, and it will never change. This is why people would just prefer instabilities to be removed entirely at this point.

The old CC thing was more of a "hit this with all you got so the number will go down."
---
The blue bar doesnt have anything like that; it also appears and disappears quickly.
---
A QoL for it is simple, mix both together: apply an icon, like the old CC bar, when the blue bar comes up, and instead of expressing a number, it says it requires crowd control affects.
---
In addition to this, skills should express what skills do crowd control. For instance, instead of just saying "Launch" it can say "Crowd Control: Launch." 
---
Or hell, only do the icon in the begining boss, so that newbies notice the significance of the blue bar.
---
No.
---
"these days"? ... come on now....
---
I hate it because you're almost forced to take the trait that increases max initiative. I don't hate the mechanic itself.
---
Elaborate on that
---
Yeah, it would have to be higher than that. But at the same time it could just give bonuses not attainable from Gold.
---
I've been advocating for a subscription that gives you your money's worth in Gems and access to all of the Living Story for literally years now. The reality is that most of the people that would be willing to pay this subscription would quit the game if it were announced now because there is no real reason to be subscribed to a game with a content flow as slow as GW2. 
---
As a raider, why would I sub to this game if I'm lucky to get one raid wing a year? Even if the money would help speed up production, Anet would have to prove that it is worth the consumer's money and currently they're far from that.
---
*Woah!* It's your **3rd Cakeday** LadyParadox86! ^(hug)
---
But that is limiting current features already available to users.
---
Im just talking about adding QoL attached to the premium that is not already available to users. 
---
No. That would be horrible. Thankfully, there's no chance of it happening.
---
Yes, My main thought process that pushed this is it would hopefully speed up production of content
---
Why can't players just learn their class?
---
no, fuck off
---
Unfortunately, there's no guarantee that it would do this and that is why a subscription in the game's current state would drive more players away than it would be worth.
---
If players were optimistic about the game, they'd feel more incentive to do it, but the reality is that outside of the casual PvE playerbase very few people are genuinely happy with how the game is right now.
---
People would definitely pay for it, but I don't see ArenaNet doing it ever or any time soon.
---
&gt;No fees on WPs
---
This bonus is virtually meaningless. Sure, it adds up, but waypoints are extremely inexpensive to use already, compared to say, salvaging.
---
Didn't Balthazar betrayed the Commander by pretending to be a Mursaat? 
---
Yeah I've been complaining about this for a while now, and to add on to what you said there are mistlocks to reset cds and give extra life and also infinite potions to give you bonus stats and healing. To be honest I didn't think fotm was hard years ago either, but it is far easier and more farmable nowadays than back then.
---
One could say that's a good thing in a sense but in my opinion it isn't, it just makes it a drag.
---
I mean at what point is that just different ways of wording the same thing. Confusion is broken, Mirage produces 25-40 confusion stacks average, Mirage is broken.
---
But it will make money. 
---
Adding those things, as well as a lot of QoL like you have suggested will absolutely entice players, with bought expansions or not, to buy it.

Yea, Im nto exactly happy with how the game is now but there isnt really any other MMO to play which is the problem. 
---
&gt;\-direct material storage while crafting
---
I like this one &lt;3 
---
I mean, the bird instability wasn't even so bad on Mai Trin since every character has 10 dodg... oh wait.
---
If you angle against the current of the swirly attack at a certain angle you can just walk out of it.
---
ah, thanks too!
---
Slippery Slope literally breaks every single ranger movement skill.  Combined with their new mechanic theory, 'Just make everything AoE all the time, everywhere,' the game literally becomes 'stand still and hope I don't die before the boss does.'
---
Completely ruins fractals.
---
Depends what you're trying to do.
---
If you intend on playing in WvW, they have a different meta compared to PvE. ( I think you'd use Cele or Trailblazer, not sure though) 
---
In PvE, asc Viper is way to go for condi dps. There's a healer scourge build (more barrier focused + ressing rather than actual healing) which can be anywhere from full magis to condi healing mix (something like marshals)
---
You can check builds out at like metabattle(for pvp,wvw) and snowcrows(raids)
---
Ready to deploy and announced a week before... So you want what we already get?
---
I am ashamed to say this, but golem week was what got me to try WvW initially.  All I play is WvW now.  It was a silly experience, but at least it introduced me into WvW.  I’m not sure if I would have gotten into the game mode otherwise.
---
"Thief montage WvW but I'm only bronze stomping or ganking"
---
To be fair, those are valuable community posts in that they show data behind game mechanics that Anet keeps purposefully obscure. 
---
It’s too cold to type the announcement.
---
Trying to solo a bounty for my Elemtalist special sword collection ascended, good build/class I need to solo or to survive a Bounty?
---
Need the Aszar bounty
---
XD That was my first thought, but it does seem a bit odd to describe a non-human as a woman...
---
He's legit dead.
---
Dragons don't have the normal means to get to the mists.
---
Glint shared with Aurene something about Ascension. Aurene could travel in and out of the mists; she did so to lure kralk into the Auditorium.
---
There was that time 3 people asked about opinions of the same 3 classes on the same day.
---
Iirc it's Rev, Ele and Guardian.
---
Isn't that the heal scourge? Or does SC have Harrier's?
---
Now you gotta buy the new plushies that came out.
---
TIL announcements are weather dependent. 
---
... except the announcement about the delay of the announcement seems to work ok ...
---
*thinking*
---
&gt; did they not know what they were going to say
---
"We're going to make an announcement on [date]" means "We're still working on stuff, but we expect to have enough ready to present it on [date]." ArenaNet just said "We do not have enough ready to present due to weather-related delays."
---
So yes, in a way, they do not know what they were going to say, because it wasn't finished by the deadline.
---
I used to main Reaper, but then one day I just got so bored of it I stopped playing it entirely. It's so sluggish and just plain boring. Basically no stunbreaks, no condi cleanse, axe as your only ranged weapon as power is not fun to use (AA is so damn slow and the other 2 skills are just boring). 
---
Greatsword is cool in theory but the skills are just so slow that it's not fun to use. 
---
It was fun for a time when I was new and needed the support from shroud, but now that I've gotten a decent chunk of hours in the game (recently clocked 2k) I don't need that anymore, so I've moved on to more fun classes.
---
You know, I would actually find a fractal instability punishing the sides that aren't outnumbered when one is pretty funny ...... I'd voice it with somebody who can do an excellent snooty tone when like John Cleese ...
---
"Oh this is boring ... Everyone on Blackgate gets agony when they dodge for the next five minutes ... " 
---
I'm going to go out on a limb here and suggest that the employees streaming are not the ones whose responsibilities include drafting and posting announcements on the forums
---
Necro main here - Play every class, prefer spell casters but there are some roles i cant get the hang of, but the class i least enjoy is Ranger, the only way i can effectively play is SB - axe/torch condi ranger, i dislike having a pet to weigh me down or to rely on, and the weapon skills are just not fun for me to play. The range skills are great but the melee weapons dont quite feel right, ive never geared up properly for a healing druid so i cant give opinion on that and due to the lack of enjoyment i honestly never bothered to try soulbeast.
---
i actually enjoy mesmer, but the only way i enjoy playing is the way that most mesmer's are not used, i hate chronomancers but love mirage. 
---
but afterall my heart belongs with Necro. 
---
That's idiotic, it's an announcement, all they have to have ready is words. They are completely incompetent to announce they are going to announce something and not making their own deadline.
---
No, that's idiotic. There's a lot more to an announcement than words - they have to be in the process of backing those words up with actual stuff.
---
Maybe we'll see him again sometime at the future, maybe helping against Krakaltorik for a truly final battle in the Mist?
---
And overwhelming amounts of Permafrost and Shadow Abyss.
---
Sorry I'm blind. xD
---
Play FFXIV instead since it has a superior glamour system ;)
---
Same thing is happening to me, but on other games like R6 too. 
---
I just assume it tastes like cough syrup.
---
Man, this is quality post
---
I don't want them to mess with skill icons or the skill bar UI. They should just add some incentivized CC tutorial, add a hint popup that points out the defiance bar a few times, or continue allowing players to learn it through the storyline.
---
Technically, the defiance bar still has an icon on the far left when it's up. It's the Unshakable icon.
---
How would you rank each profession from the easiest to the hardest to play across all content (PvP, WvW, Fractal, Raids)?
---
Deluxe edition Living World could be interesting; could get a random miniture from each new story when it's released. Could also gain access to that season's stories no matter when you log in instead of having to go back and buy a previous episode. Maybe x amount of the new map's currency if there is one. Small things that would just  enhance the experience for more casual players.
---
Personally, and I mean personally, I'd say:
---
9. Warrior
---
8. Necromancer
---
7. Ranger
---
6. Guardian
---
5. Thief
---
4. Revenant
---
3. Mesmer
---
2. Elementalist
---
1. Engineer
---
You'll have to switch in 1 year anyway since extended support is ending.
---
He got eaten
---
158 is my favourite.
---
[Mirage](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/mirage/condition/). It's the best cDPS on the fights that want heavy cDPS.
---
Teleport to friend is also worthless in some cases. I still have 217 of those items around. I have practically everything unlocked on all characters so it's all just a WP and a few raptor jumps away. It is a thing that loses value the more someone plays.
---
I roughly agree with /u/Shard477, but it's hard to rank some classes when considering all 3 game modes in a single list. A class can be very easy in one game mode, and very hard in another.  For example, PvE Revenant is fairly technical, but nowhere near as hard as Ele/Engineer.   WvW Revenant might be the most brainless zerg class there is. But the class is brutally difficult in PvP; it is extremely punishing to misuse a skill.
---
In general, I'd consider Necromancer, Ranger, Warrior, Guardian, and Thief to be the easier classes.  And Revenant, Mesmer, Elementalist, and Engineer to be technical in some or all game modes.
---
Like I said, rebalances have improved things, but I still see vastly more Chrono than I do Reve + Firebrand in raids.
---
That could even thematically work in Divinity's Reach. It could be a mini-event that happens in the Eastern Commons (where the circus is).
---
They have that giant pit where Marjory and Kasmeer's house is, and it's been under construction for years. They can make it a big pinata stand or something.
---
Mesmer!?
---
I hate Warrior. 
---
The weapons feel extremely sluggish compared to other classes, and not in a good way.
---
... are they Quaggan plushies?
---
I really am! I absolutely love them!
---
SC recommends shaman/marshal mix and doesn't use mercy runes. Basically focusing on the cleanse and CC of the class while still doing pretty big barriers and being able to have a little more *oomph* in Epidemic.
---
That damn bird instab in fracs
---
So it changes flavor at the end of PoF?
---
&gt; Probably works alright in PvE 
---
Power scourge is practically unheard of (for good reason) in pve content. Anything works in open world, but for instanced content you want condition Scourge, healer Scourge, or power Reaper.
---
Got every class just looking for a class that can solo a or survive a bounty in pof, do need the bounty for a elementalist special collection weapon but I dont need to complete or solo the bounty with a elementalist, so any advice would be welcome :P
---
Inaccurate. Better if talked in comparison of scalability of skill comboes as base stats and consider burst dmg/heal against sustained durations. Also how realistic it is to pull in actual scenarios
---
And if this were to be the case, how exactly do you think this is explained to the audience?
---
It seems that your theory is heavily bound to the origins of the whole GW story, pre-dating some of the stuff from the first game even. And then there are players who started playing a year ago.
---
So are they gonna tl:dr this with a "if you didn't get it, go read lore from wiki" or are they gonna present us a cut scene of Taimi explaining nearly the entire gw lore and it's meaning while withering away on her deatbed?
---
It's nice theorycrafting and all, it's just way too deep lorewise for a wild estimate of ~99,8% of players. 
---
I was talking about the grieving scourge
---
Yeah, neither grieving or celestial is used at all in instanced PvE on necromancer. Defensive stats have no place in the meta except on healers or "tanks".
---
No offense taken. Having more people see the same issues as me can't hurt.
---
Druid, Revenant (mostly in WvW), and Daredevil 
---
Wvw guardian, thief 
---
While mesmer and elementalist are tied for my most disliked class on paper, I've come to loathe mesmer because of associations with specific people and raiders in general.
---
Mesmer has never been my style even with its elite specs and I find it has way too many buttons to push and CD's to keep track of for it to be enjoyable to me. You wouldn't think this is controversial, especially since I never have told people their choice in class sucks—I'm all for people playing what they want and recognize that just because mesmer doesn't suit me doesn't mean others won't love it. But nope. Been told by so many people to "just play mesmer for more dps lol" or "if you played mirage you wouldn't have to think about dodging :D" or "everyone should gear up a mesmer!!"
---
Completely unprompted, too, and some people in one of my guilds would say similar things multiple times per hour or whenever anyone else mentioned a class they were on. This was also paired with crapping on people who didn't play or like mesmer and saying all other classes were terribad.
---
Throw in raids and raiders and how mesmer's have been allowed to do so much for so long that encounters had to be designed with 2 chronos in mind, well, with the nerfs that are slowly being rolled out you would think mesmers are in a worse place than minion master base necro in raids. Chronos (and mesmers in general) are still meta/top tier on most fights, but because they can't do everything better alone than the other 8 people it is deemed as proof Arenanet hates mesmers.
---
TL;DR: Mesmer and elementalist bore me but mesmers are associated with assholes on top of that, making it my most disliked class.
---
At least chronomancer can’t apply 10+ boons by itself anymore - that was a step in the right direction.

He was a rebellious child, so he bleached his crystals and ran away from Kesho.
---
~~its not just a phase mom, this is who I *really am*~~
---
Roughly 100g vs 400g, ehh.
---
I used to adore warrior. But as of right now, I gotta say it's my least favorite profession at the moment. It's original design was fine but has made the profession as a whole suffer as elite specs have joined in. At the end of the day, anything it can do, someone else can do better plus something else.
---
Change my mind if you can. Maybe I'm following meta trends too much and I'm missing out on more "fun" ways to play. But I definitely think warrior needs some love to get it out of this rut.
---
Yay Jenzi :) nex here.  
---
Quaggan likes your husband
---
What's the nuance/difference between either Renegade or Nightmare for condi Mirage?
---
Take some power reaper open world build from metabattle then.
---
The wiki, as well as gw2timer.com
---
That's pretty sick. I actually forgot you overlaid music for a second and was freaking out over how intimidating that roaring sound was when paired with Kralk. Nice work.
---
I don't really like any of the classes: when I think of my favourite classes of all time, none of the GW2 ones pop up. Which is a shame, since GW1 mesmer, necro, rit, ranger and even assassin are classes that I highly enjoyed.
---
Between being locked into weapons, the small selection of utilities (and, once again, being locked into them), between the design of skills (massive cooldowns, uninspired design, shitty visuals while still causing tons of visual noise), the difference between power and conditions (thus further limiting your build), trait systems (where you end up choosing traits you do not care for to get the things you enjoy, all while giving up on traits that do excite you), ...
---
Having said that, I also don't know if there is a class I dislike. I think the classes are just very shallow and pedestrian, but outside of stealth and clones, I think I am mostly just disappointed by them, rather than disliking them.
---
Can we also talk about how slippery slope makes a bunch of people really physically ill.
---
When I first played it I like violently threw up from nausea and I’ve heard that this has happened to others.
---
Run rabid:

---
Super cheap and good enough.
---
Confusion punishes poor play. Don't mash and you won't die. Confusion isn't broken, its binary. It either does nothing, or someone panics, hits too many buttons and kills themselves.
---
Ele gets shiny skills from attunements for free (and eventually conjureds), engi needs kits.
---
Majority of ele skills have unique animations, while lots of engi skills share animation but have different effect (bomb and grenades for example). 
---
Ele is complex by default, engi only with kits, but no-kit engi is kinda terrible unless it's holo (only because holo is overloaded with big numbers for no reason) so people always tie them together because of similarity in skill level.
---
Elite specs on ele at least have some ties to core class mechanic, engi ones have barely any.
---
Literally all the professions are listed as 3-star power and condi damage except for necromancer in power. That's a horrible representation.  It also is clearly intended to include the abilities given through elite specs but doesn't mark them, giving the illusion that some professions are just good at nearly everything.
---
I will come to OP's defense on the health pools though.  That's been a known thing since early in the game.  Left to their health pools alone, each armor class has a tanky one, a medium one, and a glassy one. So despite guardian's blocks, it has a naturally lower health pool.
---
All-in-all, though, this chart is pretty lacking in worthwhile information. It's just too simplified, even if it had gotten everything arguably correct.
---
Can someone tell/explain me why metabattle suggest Assasins gear over berserker for woe/temp/weaver for PvE?
---
But does it need to be clear and explained to players?
---
If it were up to me, I wouldn't even bother trying to explain the flameseeker prophecies directly. I'd shove it into the background. Drop little lore pieces mentioning them throughout maps, sort of like what they did with Zinn. Ways of *showing* rather than *telling*. I think that's optimal for a variety of reasons. For one, that allows the ones who know the lore to nod slyly at you, the writer - they see what you're doing, and that sort of subtlety is fun. Two, it gives the curious the tools to start digging deeper into a section of lore they didn't know about. Three, it doesn't choke the main narrative and bore people who just want to play the game or get to the action.
---
Offloading detail into the background isn't possible in literature. Everything has to be described on the page, and in text. A narrative is a constant linear flow, and for that reason detail bogs it down. You can't shove details off to the side where the observant or interested will take notice of them. However, that sort of thing is totally possible in any visual medium. Paragraphs to pages of description or exposition that would choke a written or oral story poof away, all captured in a few images more precisely than words could ever convey.
---
With this sort of thing, I think its all about the execution. And while I have plenty of gripes with the GW2 story, I think Joko was executed on fine. He's the dictator of some far off land which doesn't have much impact on our part of Tyria. It's not surprising me to that when I visit a far off land, there exist problems and people I've never heard of. I dislike narratives with too much direct exposition because things bore me when I can see them coming. I like it when there's just enough to keep me guessing and mentally involved.
---
Male or female sylvari though? 
---
I'll take safety first any day.
---
&gt; They seem pretty incompetent these years.
---
ftfy
---
Trickery isn't really betrayal since they never were allied tbh. Balthazar *did* try to be the Commander's ally, the Commander just wasn't having any of it.
---
its 2018, slack and teleconferencing is a thing. Lots of a teams and companies work fully remotely now.
---
&gt; How many times have they announced something and had to deal with unexpected consequences of their announcements.
---
by deal with you mean ignore and remove forum posts?
---
CC in events like Istan isn't gonna work that well.
---
1) It's catch 22. Lot of People would CC but since they think "no one else will CC in this game!1", so they won't "waste cooldowns" for nothing.  
---
2) Istan is ran because it is "brain off"-farming. No one needs to know anything really. Follow comm, tag stuff, read what game says in huge texts ("Caravan up! Great Hall soon! Pala is coming!")
---
3) Potato-machine players. Huge events are still full of people. Even with Lowest settings some people's computers play it on 10 fps - probably.
---
4) Istan is full of staff necros, turret engis and generally "specs that do little DMG or CC  but tag a lot of stuff". 
---
5) some CC need to be aimed and swirling can affect that little.
---
Maybe Vlast is not biologically tied to Glint, maybe she found his egg somewhere and just give it some of her power. Maybe that's why Glint favor Aurene more?
---
you were talking about dealing with backlash / responses to announcements. not doing enhancement / bug fixes. None of your points applies to this scenario.
---
[Marking Team CONFIRMED](https://www.twitch.tv/guildwars2/clip/HeadstrongShyClintmullins4Head?filter=clips&amp;range=24hr&amp;sort=time)
---
&gt; Aurene was terrified of her death, but came to the Auditorium. Kralkatorrik fears a world without him, but went there too; they accept their audience with each other. Tarir is in the west, Kralk doesn't need to accept that, it's just a fact.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Zain was compassionate, I guess, but it seems odd that such a peripheral character would be described as the "Heart of Kryta".
---
The "Heart of Kryta" wasn't Zain specifically, but what he represented: the White Mantle. They ruled Kryta at the time, and rulership of a nation is often referred to as that nation's heart or head.
---
Kralkatorrik doesn't accept anything though, that's kind of the point of his story. He **denies** the only thing given to him, and seeks everything else.
---
&gt; Aurene ate Joko, Kralk ate (most of) Balthazar.
---
Which is irrelevant to the description in the line. The betrayer have justice brought to them by the betrayed. Aurene and Kralkatorrik weren't betrayed.
---
&gt; Maybe not; Vlast was forsaken by his Champion and Kralkatorrik lost an eye, however. A son and a father; not a son and HIS father.
---
Which is, again, irrelevant to the lines. They're not severed by words, but action; Vlast could arguably be forsaken, but missing one eye does not make a man blind. And this completely ignores the "lost relic".
---
&gt; EDIT: Alternatively, and this actually might fit better (from Requiem):
---
Pretty random and out of the way thing to be referencing the charr society when everything else is, supposedly, about Kralkatorrik.
---
&gt; Not so.
---
&gt; Not that I think this throw away demon is some grand mastermind; I'm more inclined to think "Unseen" more refers to, well, something not being seen. Possible because, like the Unseen, it can slip into the Mists.
---
I believe the Unseen is called such because it's just never seen (because it has to be summoned and never does get summoned).
---
Besides, it's very clearly referencing the mursaat when you take in the other lines referencing the Unseen. Such as:
---
*The Unseen war will not cease&lt;br&gt;The robed ones falter, blinded by the strength of their faith*
---
And: 
---
*Because of the dwarves' discord and negligence&lt;br&gt;An opening will be given to the disciples of the Unseen*
---
And:
---
*Is cast up from behind the Door&lt;br&gt;The hand of the worthy will burn the Unseen from Tyria*
---
Combine all these, and the Unseen here refer to a group that is worshiped in Kryta, who's follows invade the Shiverpeaks due to the dwarves' civil war, and will be wiped out by what's behind the Door (or Komalie).
---
AKA, the mursaat.
---
&gt; The tyrant whose own hand drowned their lungs in seawater could be Zhaitan, or if one was to interpret the Vizier as his hand, King Reza.
---
Neither of those drowned their nation. Only Khilbron did.
---
&gt; I'm not saying I'm totally right. I'm saying the current school of thought on the Flameseeker Prophecies could be wrong. It has happened before.
---
The thing about prophecies is that, yes, they're vague, but the prophet knows what's being referenced and Glint confirms that Khilbron is the Flameseeker and his death will fulfill the prophecy. Glint is not only credited with compiling the Flameseeker Prophecies, but foreseeing them.
---
The Flameseeker Prophecies was made for the campaign which is literally dubbed *Prophecies*. The Elder Dragons weren't even a pair of two braincells rubbing together in any developer's mind at the time when those verses were written (they *were* written for the initial GW1 game, confirmed by devs, iirc during a post-PoF Guild Chat).
---
Like Turai believing himself the Chosen of the Prophecy, linking the verses to other things only work if you selectively take specific parts of various lines, as you had done. When you look at the whole together, they only fit the events of Prophecies - so much so that it's very, very silly for Turai to have thought himself the Chosen of the Prophecy really.
---
&gt; Also, it didn't exactly render the Charr helpless; inconvenienced and soggy, yes, but hardly saved the kingdom.
---
Unseen in the game, there was a debuff given to all charr after that cinematic that made them weak and easier to kill. The point of the line is that it was believed to be able to save the kingdom, but it doesn't. Hence "The beasts fall under the sword, but it will not be enough". The charr there are killed easily due to Stormcaller, and viewed as a sign from the gods that Ascalon will be saved, but it will not be enough: Ascalon was doomed still.
---
&gt; EDIT 2: On your first point on the Tombs, I'm more referring to the point of fact that the diabolic gathering was not closed off; Glint did mention the Tombs in the transcript, but not to us:
---
The diabolic gathering refers solely to the titans. And the Door of Komalie was closed, thus it was indeed closed off.
---
The rest is actually referring to the PvP that originally took place in Tombs. There were no plans during the making of Prophecies to have the place wiped out or for Abaddon's return to be called Nightfall. It's not even clear that Abaddon was thought up - if you look at Prophecies and Factions alone, then while you do get the sense of a hidden puppetmaster, initial indication shows Dhuum. And looking through development actually suggests that Arachnia might have been planned to be the end villain before Abaddon was fully conceived. This is largely theoretical on my part, but I think that while they always planned for some "fallen god" to be behind the scenes of things, that it went from "Dhuum is the fallen god behind the scenes" (Prophecies, early Factions development) to "Arachnia is the fallen god behind the scenes" (late Factions development, very early Nightfall development) to "Abaddon is the fallen god behind the scenes" (early Nightfall development).
---
We're going to wait until next week to tell you all that our extensive redesign focused on Guild v Guild v Guild is still on the table.
---
Out of interest, is that objectively better in terms of napkin math using benchmark numbers or actually with a decent number of comparative logs on a range of encounters?
---
FB/Ren feels like it's been objectively better based on the former for quite sometime but I've yet to see the latter and that'd be nice evidence to have. 
---
Female sylvari is winning!!
---
The reason is most likely that it was looking good on him on concept arts (and at the end, it does). I don't think there is always a strong lore meaning to every artistic choice, but sometimes, just design ideas that work. 
---
But I could totally be wrong on that case, of course.
---
I mean I don't have a million logs on hand at the moment, but in double healer comps you basically trading one DPS class for a healer. Having that healer produce either quickness or alacrity basically allows you to directly upgrade the Chrono in that subgroup to either an FB or a Ren. I don't really think it needs much proving that an FB or a Ren will out damage (and arguably out utility) a 2nd Chrono.
---
Now if we are discussing single healer groups, that is much more up to debate and I agree would need a wide range of logs to accurately compare. But it goes without saying in double healer groups FB/Ren (you can keep one chrono) very easily better.
---
He has become one with Dragon's Stand.
---
Neither of those things were a bug. There was backlash to decisions made by the company. 
---
I fully understand the logic behind it but that is really only what I ever see posted in support of the composition and normally those numbers are based on golem benchmarks which are unrealistic descriptions of boss encounters.
---
It would be nice to finally see some definitive proof but if the comparisons aren't there yet it's probably just a matter of waiting for more people to test it. 
---
Bright side of that interaction, it lead to the creation of the arena area in Obsidian Sanctum.
---
so im assuming that you mean the response to the mastery backlash instead of the actual fix for the mastery which wasn't done until weeks later. the response iirc took at least 2 weeks and lets assume there was a snow storm then, you're saying they can't have discussed this on a teleconference and then had someone make an announcement from their laptop at home on the forum / front page?
---
Basically people get upset when they cant blow through t3 - 4 dailies content in 45 minutes with straight dps and a little support. Anything that causes them to change stuff up or think about the content is now "tedious". They can't be bothered the now spend a bit more time trying to beat harder content.
---
You can move just fine with SS just account for the effect, I.e. that you won't stop when u let go of the keys and will slide for a bit, it's not that hard 
---
The same reason why they can't print key screenshots
---
My vote is for Sylvari.  With that said I ran with a Charr (Ash legion) and I absolutely love the animations and the way a hulking thief blinks/moves around,  Have fun!
---
definitely agree. i love the theme of berserker but i hate that it's a condi spec, they named it after power stats, they themed it after what would be a power burst but they made it condi for some stupid reason. i hate the theme of spellbreaker but i pretty much have to play it if i want to do enough dps.
---
I'm not bitching, moaning or flaming. I am genuinely curious - how does bad weather delay an announcement that probably would have already been prepared? 
---
Turning quaggans into meals and pillows truly is the only fate deserving those blubbery bastards.
---
I like core warrior banner slave, Spellbreaker boon ripping is fun to play too but I hate that both sets of weapons for Warriors are melee. It's not much of a problem before, but now I prefer to go on my Soulbeast or Core Guard in dealing with the new cancer instabilities in fractals. 
---
Nah, it isn't really the Diviner Ren/ Quickbrand vs Chronomancer dps that I'm interested in. When I've tried groups with my Ren, the issue has always felt that the healing output generally isn't as smooth as with Chronomancer/Druid and that encounter mechanics mess things up more.
---
What I'd ideally like to see are comparative logs (from any time reasonable group) so that things like total group dps, scholar up time and time to kill can be compared since those metrics don't come from the usual benchmark-based comparisons that people do.

I'm a thief main though and since my support options are either limited by boss or not great I'm mainly just interested in definitive proof that FB/Ren is reasonably comparable so that we actually start seeing more support diversity. Maybe if Anet sees that people want to play different things we might get better support balance and resolution of issues like Spirits and Banners. That is probably wishful thinking though. 
---
I didn't know the announcements would suffer that much under the weather. They must been written on silk paper.
---
I think it's an adaptation thing. 
---
We met Vlast as a baby in GW1 and back then he was blue, just like Glint and Aurene. 
---
Since he was brought to Kesho and rised there, he adjusted to his environment. I mean the excalted are golden/yellow and Kesho is in mid of a desert (with yellow sand obviously). So it makes sense to change the color, also to camouflage. A blue dragon would be very easy to see in the desert. 
---
And who knows, maybe the excalted helped him getting yellow. Maybe it was all their doing and Vlast couldn't do anything against it (or was okay with it), maybe he didn't even remember, because it happend right after they brought him to Kesho and he was a baby.

Read.Your.Fucking.Skills.
---
Thanks for going out of your way to counter this theory, because I also do not deem it accurate. 
---
I do believe Glint is lying when she deems it necessary, that Aurene's death HAD to happen, and that there might be another prophecy that is yet to be revealed, these are all points I already firmly believed based on the events of last episode and what we know of Glint
---
But I regard the Flameseeker Prophecies as a GW1 matter, and the interpretation of each verse makes more sense in relation to GW1 events.
---
That being said, I would love the idea of a prophecy that is inherently misunderstood for centuries, despite it being as extensive and (kind of) specific as the Flameseeker Prophecies. The depth of GW2's storytelling does not, however, imply that they would ever dare to tell such a complex story that pays off mostly to those who even read the prophecy. (I'm sure the vast majority of players haven't read the entire Flameseeker Prophecies).

&gt;None of this was the real issue with golem week.
---
I don't remember that particular bug, but I will say that the stuff I mentioned was a big issue with golem week. 
---
* No supply required golems with double damage made it so it was extremely annoying to try and hold anything. It was constant golem rushes (and this was pre-nerfed golems and before stuff like shield gens and invuln walls). But even besides just rushes, you had havoc groups (that would normally have to hold a camp for a bit and build up a golem) being able to just insta build omegas right at their target. No back and fourth and buildup that a scout could potentially spot beforehand. Meaning it gave just 1 or a few people free time to just desiege or do some decent damage to a structure before a scout could actually see it and respond.
---
* Along with that, there was also the golem abilities themselves that could make fights just a pain in the ass. Constant golems just using their spinning knockback. If you try and soften them up with siege, you'll just have omegas using their projectile punches to take your stuff out. And this isn't even mentioning how tanky golems can be and the fact (if I remember right) that during that point in time their total hp was based to your character's vitality (so you could get golems that were even more tanky).
---
Like if you go back into the old threads with feedback on golem week, the most common complaints you'll see other WvWer's make was it "turning WvW into a constant EotM ktrain" or the golems "preventing good fights". Not to say that what you're saying didn't happen or wasn't a big problem too, just that from my memory of things that went on with my server at the time (and a little back checking some forums/reddit feedback posts) the things I mentioned were big issues as well.
---
Their loss. XD
---
For the sake of discussion, I'm going to pull back on the "Glint plagiarized Kralkatorrik to kill the Mursaat with a prophecy that wasn't even about them" hardline stance for a bit, and posit something a little more nuanced (yep, that's what this conspiracy is missing, more nuance):
---
There are certain keystone "patterns" which echo throughout history in different iterations. The Ascension ritual. The vengeful God breaking their shackles and invading the mortal realm. The Pact of five races standing against the Draconic cycle. And, the Flameseeker Prophecies, in which the powerful attempt to run from fate, but instead hasten its arrival. Not quite a Fractal loop, but more than coincidence.
---
Other crafting professions are capable of doing basic refinement, so you don't always have to change crafting professions to refine your supplies.
---
That was actaully the thing that made me angry. I can understand that a closed studio due to weather can deley things since it is not only one man involved when something is moving to the final were it will be presented. I got disapointed but i can certainly understand it. 
---
But what i do expect in such situation is the explanation, ok guys this is what happen and we need another week, so on ___day next week we will make the anouncement so stay tuned.
---
That would make me feel disapointed at first and then i would think oh well i will make time on ___day to listen in what will happen. 
---
Instead we get the explanation and then next week which means anything from Monday to Sunday and i am suppose to wait every day every hour and i am also in EU which means i have to adjust the time to US time to check in if something happen. That sucks, like it litterally SUCKS and my time is more valuble then that and yet i am left with that and that made me upset, not the deley.
---

why do you have to wait every day for the announcement? the announcement will still be there after a couple of hours or a day for you to read/see. I can understand that you want to be online once the big thing is going live on the servers but why do you have to be one of the first ones to read the announcement?
---
Because it is the game mode i spend anything from 3-8 hours in every day and there for are very interested in what is going on and especially if there is such thing as a bigger update comming which is not even a yearly event. I mean i got excited about the bug fix of Garrisons water gate which took 5 years.
---
If you want to kill this game, it would work gloriously.
---
I'd pay it.
---
This is too good :D
---
Hello Gw2 wvwers! we are happy to announce, WVW FOR MOBILE 
---
Yeah, condi.
---
I prefer torch to sword because of its AoE abilities. I'll look into scepter, thanks.
---
why?
---
Bosses that require everyone to do a job, instead of requiring only a few to do anymore than pressing their rotation.
---
Jumping parts in between like we see in the newest wing are also a nice addition, as is the 10% "everyone needs to gather orbs now" phase from Dhuum.
---
I agree that I somehow always seem to want to "save" shatters. Good tip, thanks.
---
cause hes bad
---
Fuck mirage
---
Nice. I am making GW houserules for the Savage Worlds system. Good to see more people brining Tyria to the tabletop!
---
Maybe dragons get there colour as they grow up? like we do with hair.
---
I don't agree with this tip. Horses do exist in the gw world, even if as players we haven't seen them yet. There are thinggs in Tyria that we may haven't experienced as players, but it doesn't mean they are not there.
---
You can't kill what is already dead.
---
Man, I should dust off my ele. Really enjoyed s/d roaming a while back and might give this a shot. Looks fun, nice video!
---
I don't think the devs will announce announcements again. They got so much hate and threads complaining simply because they are going to change something. But every patch where WvW doesn't get mentioned people get salty because they never get any updates. 
---
Asura deadeye looks amazing. Wootini!
---
Bubble invaded the mists turning all battlegrounds underwater, enjoy!
---
Because mirage has a great duelling potential and average team support. 
---
Or, maybe, because losing direct duels to something is insulting and "mirageisbad" is basically a thoughtless circlejerk meme at this point. 
---
Agreed. PoF encounters really check my boxes
---
Warrior and guardian. I dont like classes with hard dps lot of sustain and tanky stuff. Just my opnion of course.
---
&gt; Kralkatorrik doesn't accept anything though, that's kind of the point of his story. He denies the only thing given to him, and seeks everything else.
---
I'm assuming you're talking about the vision he foresaw of his death? This is one of the reasons I found this topic worthy of more discussion; he has some odd similarities to the Mursaat, who raged against their own destiny and brought it on themselves.
---
&gt; The betrayer have justice brought to them by the betrayed. Aurene and Kralkatorrik weren't betrayed.
---
My linking of Aurene with Joko, and Kralkatorrik with Balthazar is maybe a little esoteric, and relies on a sort of...'soul transferrence' when one's magic is consumed. I don't know the exact distinction between 'soul' and 'magic', but I personally suspect there is not one at all.
---
&gt; They're not severed by words, but action; Vlast could arguably be forsaken, but missing one eye does not make a man blind. And this completely ignores the "lost relic".
---
My original idea on the 'lost relic' was the Dragonsblood Spear, but it was not celebrated as a gift of the gods, rather it was destroyed so it wouldn't be a gift for a god. I'll concede this portion. Though I do wonder if Kralkatorrik losing an eye might impact on his ability to forsee the future; we will have to wait and see.
---
&gt; Pretty random and out of the way thing to be referencing the charr society when everything else is, supposedly, about Kralkatorrik.
---
Like the original interpretation, there are multiple players in the Prophecies. I did attempt to do a post where I re-interpreted as much of the Verses as I could (it was an absolute mess of wiki links, as you might expect), in which I linked Rytlock to 'the exile who holds the key', and Logan to 'the new son who holds the key'; the key being Rurik's sword. The prophecy isn't about Kralkatorrik, it is about his death, and the necessary preconditions for it.
---
&gt; I believe the Unseen is called such because it's just never seen (because it has to be summoned and never does get summoned).
---
I agree, and this illustrates the point; there is more than one way to be Unseen. You can slip outside of reality (like the Mursaat and, provisionally, Kralkatorrik), simply not provably exist (like the Unseen), or, more literally, just go unnoticed. 
---
&gt; The Unseen war will not cease/The robed ones falter, blinded by the strength of their faith
---
"The Unseen War" could reference Glint's army combatting the Branded incursion in the Mists. "The robed ones", in my opinion, can refer to the Zaishen and the Forged.
---
&gt; Is cast up from behind the Door/The hand of the worthy will burn the Unseen from Tyria
---
This is another thing: there are multiple references to doors. Sometimes, with modifiers; "Conflict at the flame Door; he holds the key", or "Fate will be sealed behind the iron door/In the heart of the flame, where this world meets another"
---
The latter modifier I find particularly interesting; the Door of Komalie would certainly constitute a flame Door, but it seems to more be an onyx/jade door rather than an iron Door. 
---
&gt; Neither of those drowned their nation. Only Khilbron did.
---
Yes, but Reza was the tyrant 'whose own hand' (ie. his trusted advisor) drowned their lungs in saltwater.
---
&gt; The Elder Dragons weren't even a pair of two braincells rubbing together in any developer's mind at the time when those verses were written (they were written for the initial GW1 game, confirmed by devs, iirc during a post-PoF Guild Chat).
---
In that same Guild Chat (iirc), it was also stated that the Verses were modified slightly before being put in GW2. Why would you need to modify a prophecy that had already come to pass?
---
&gt; Like Turai believing himself the Chosen of the Prophecy, linking the verses to other things only work if you selectively take specific parts of various lines, as you had done. When you look at the whole together, they only fit the events of Prophecies - so much so that it's very, very silly for Turai to have thought himself the Chosen of the Prophecy really.
---
(you caught me, I'm riddled with confirmation bias XD)
---
But, Turai believing himself to be the Chosen is a really interesting point; what COULD have convinced him that he was the Hero, rather than the guide? Well, there was a part of All or Nothing that raised some alarm bells for me.
---
*Caithe: Oh, good—more trials. Why didn't you mention any of this before?*
---
*Ogden Stonehealer: We were waiting for the signs: Glint's egg hatching, the lich's death...*
---
*Ogden Stonehealer: And the sands of Glint's hourglass have begun to glow. Her scion's already in the refuge.*
---
The only thing that we're aware of that seemed to convince Turai Ossa that he ought to make the Pilgrimage to Augury Rock, was that he defeated Palawa Joko. I cannot provide a direct reference for the other two points in the Verses that would meet your meticulous standards, so I'm not going to embarass myself; but it's another odd parallel.
---
&gt; Unseen in the game, there was a debuff given to all charr after that cinematic that made them weak and easier to kill. 
---
That is actually fascinating, thanks! I'm going to concede on Stormcaller, I know when I'm outmatched. XD
---
I want a wing where you can choose the order in which you fight encounters and that order determines part of the final encounters conditions. 
---
Tbh the Superior Buried Treasures aren't too bad. I mainly do those for music box chance. You can also get other good loot.
---
But as for regular Buried Treasures I agree with you. They're kinda weak atm.
---
Really nice video. Made me feel nostalgic about the good old D/D ele. This is way better than the meme shit Cellofag tries to pull off lmao. 
---
Smallest male asura you could create. At least most daredevils are like that.
---
On an average meta run, I obtain about 22 Superior Buried Treasures. This is easily worth a lot more than the waypoint fees. Just get a Mesmer (what I use) or a Thief, train movement with all mounts and find when and where they are best applicable, and finally search for the treasures. If you mess up somewhere it's fine.
---
Seems daunting but it's not too hard to pull off.
---
250li pls
---
Edge of the mists map. Its such a beautiful area.
---
Hey guys! I commisioned my Charr, what do you think?
---
*Male charr that is missing some key and ugly features of his race is showing very defined muscles despete the fur.*
---
yep, love that theme!
---
Yeah but still funny as hell 😀 .
---
But i want MORE dhuum 
---
A lot more
---
underwater raids
---
"Big spender" too! 25 Badges of Honor is nothing, you probably have a load from achievement reward chests if you've been playing more than a few months.
---
This meme is so old it's not even funny anymore !
---
Implying Anet would nerf Mirage before they release the enxt set of elite specs to sell the new expansion
---
Madbe add the game mode? Because at least in PvE this makes no sense. Oh wait it also doesnt in WvW. Or PvP. Man i dont know what game you are playing, but it sure is not Guild Wars 2. 
---
To be fair, we’ve had really bad weather over here. And because WA is so hilly and mountainous, snow and ice can be hell for us. 
---
I really get what you mean but the whole point of raiding is that its suppose to be something else (not a world boss) if someone wants to see the story behind the raid he should work for it because its a different content which is not open world, its harder and not everything in this game should be served in a golden plate.
---
If im not wrong WoW was a good example of how raids were part of the story and also hard before the lfr launched. 
---
I started playing GW2 about 8 months ago finished HOT and got well into POF before I knew what CC was. Some nice person took the time to type out before a bounty that when they call for CC use attacks that Stun, Knockdown, Pull, Trip, etc...    
---
Now before every event, bounty, or boss that needs CC to be defeated I try to explain what CC is. I have this in a notepad file ready to copy and paste:
---
"When someone calls for CC or you see a green bar under the bosses Lifebar use knockdowns, stuns, pulls, knockbacks, trips and any attack that hampers movement to break the green bar so we can kill the boss."   
---
I find too many veteran players wait and yell out CC at the moment CC is needed and new players have no idea whats going on. If an event depends on CC to succeed treat everyone as being new and explain what CC is before the CC is needed.
---
Level 1-80 in Core do nothing to explain what the green break bar is and that CC is needed to break it. Most players entering HOT, POF, Fractals, etc have no idea what CC is or how break bars work.
---
The game needs a tutorial for it. Something as simple as a Training dummy in the starting quest to HOT or POF with someone telling you to deplete the dummies green bar with your (insert their profession/weapon attack here) before you can defeat it, would do wonders for explaining CC to people. 
---
Eeeeh. Complaining about reflect while running a pew pew sb and not using unblockable despite 100% knowing about EM, not going in to pressure when he's low and just sort of running after the chrono, throwing a 2 and missing every time despite him barely dodging... This video tries to prove that you need half a brain to kill a mesmer? I mean, yeah, Mirage needs a slap to it's wrist, but \*come on\*. The montage doesn't do any justice to the argument, sorry.
---
If fashion is important to you then sylvari. Planning pvp or wvw? You might want to go with something smaller, plus the animations of asura are really cool.
---
This is someone doing silver play and losing to kiting and being +1ed.
---
HoT maps are usually my way yo go for farming those mats and you get shit ton of em. Silverwastes meta etc. You will need exalted keys crowbar and bandit keys etc to open the map chests though as most will drop from there. Farming gold is for most daily fractals / silverwastes / istan though istan is daily while silverwastes is more ideal. You keep all the bags you loot and open them on level 49-55 character and salvage then sell all the mats. Good day and you can get 30g an hour.
---
As a Portuguese native who can sort of understand and communicate basic Spanish, I honestly can't even tell half the words he's trying to say ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I tought about that too, like super hilarous.
---
Imagine a bush at 2 meters high with two giant robust legs coming from it. 10/10 will stealth again.
---
Warriors are usually the best way. Revenant is complicated as class in general and PVP has no room for errors much. If you have expansion then spellbreaker warriors are quite strong and easier to learn. 
---
Also keep your classes strength in mind. Revs are good at certain 1v1 matchups and are more for roaming and helping the sides rather than running in to the middle of the enemy. Warriors are very strong duel class so you mostly play on the side zones rather than the cluster in the middle.
---
Yup, i plan on roaming when i Max him\her
---
Just speculation but i think it has something to do with their alignment (good/neutral/evil).
---
Purple crystal dragons are just baddies, blue crystal dragons are good. And Vlast (considering his champion never showed up and just doesn't care in general) is somewhere between the two.
---
\*regretfully pins map of the Realm of Torment back up on the conspiracy corkboard\*
---
How can I get hit with 9000 damage with auto-attack while wearing marauder armor, commander trinkets and protection spam is beyond me.
---
If you have full tyria mastery then it will auto loot and the chests will be un-interactable. Thats all i can think of.
---
we haven't died yet so we're still in the fight
---
That's a very depressing life.
---
I cannot even to begin imagining what horrors await us with the next Mesmer elite spec...
---
That first mesmer probably was laughing pretty hard, would have died with 1 hit left and thief proceeds to not hit him for 15 seconds without him even dodging. But sure, nerf mesmer.
---
I wouldn't say they usually announce announcements. It's a joke that blizzard does it all the time. But gw2 usually just announce things that a tally happen roughly a week later. They don't announce announcements that often imo.
---
This is the rangers' revenge, for all the times they've been kicked out of the squads for not playing a META class.
---
&gt; Sadly, I think this is going to be an ongoing trend *in the industry* which doesn't say good things in general.
---
Maybe in the MMORPG industry which is failing miserably either way.
---
Riot and valve are constantly working on their community interaction and do a reasonably good job at this. From what I hear the PoE devs are communicating with their playerbase quite a lot too.
---
HS's most succesful era had ben brode actually communicating with the players on what they wanted to do, and how they'd try and do it. WoW also had plenty of vocal CMs and GMs that interacted with the playerbase in various areas. Which admittedly just got fired. 
---
All these companies have fuckups and made mistakes. And imo, in the long run the better PR was always when the company owned up to it and had open dialogue. You still won't keep everyone happy, but the games overall are more succesful.
---
I do agree that these communications are done by professionals. The people doing the balancing aren't the ones writing about the balancing, most of the time. But this also shows there's a clear, company-wide vision and communication for the direction of the game. Something which with anet honestly just feels lacking. 
---
In fact, a lot of players are upset with acti/blizzards direction of not informing them with their trajectory. Aka "oh hey here's a mobile shitty diablo and fuck your expectations because we didn't tell you shit" and "Oh we know we told you we're supporting esports, but oops we're scrapping our esports". This also harmed their credibity.
---
Bethesda got backlash for not communicating. Blizzard got backlash for not communicating. Anet gets backlash for not communicating. EA gets backlash for ~~not communicating~~ milking their players.
---
In many upcoming, succesful online games there is a trend of good communication with the playerbase. In many declining games, communication is avoided because openly stating the company is lowering the investment of resources into a game is often not a good sign. But in anet's case, they were just always bad at it. 
---
Not saying. As weather doesn't happen. I'm saying people wouldn't be dissapoy if the Devs didn't announce the announcement.
---
😱😱 maybe go feed some hungry cats to bring balance back :p
---
How does an ass taste like?
---
what about the hour between fractals and sleep
---
Vlast was being controlled by Samantha, while Aurene and Glint were controlled by Richtofen.
---
because raids are too hard for the majority of the community, the raid player base is just too small for newcomers to have a fast introduction to raids and the learning curve is too long until personal success.
---
Exactly, I didn't think about it at the time, but Joko is actually a great example of what I was talking about.
---
Without consulting any external lore sources, I was able to figure out who he was and what he was all about just by being a little curious, exploring, and listening to dialogue in both the foreground and background.
---
It's so subtle that I almost forgot how I learned everything. Which is great, in my opinion. Integrating all that information into the experience so seamlessly is impressive. I'd remember long rants and diatribes because they'd annoy me. But the little lore pieces I uncovered were forgettable in themselves, but the bigger picture they created stuck with me.
---
50 minutes for Fractals? sounds like a static to me. Pugs will not be able to do that (or only in the rarest of cases)
---
People will argue that it's not immersive enough and that's fair. It's different when you actually experience it ingame and listen to dialogue as opposed to reading the wiki whilst being in a cleared instance.
---
Healer support.
---
1) Abilities magically make all of the raid take 66% less damage. Only class with 20 target cap because have to be in meta somehow.
---
2) heals reverse all damage taken every 3 seconds unless dying in that time
---
3) elite ability makes whole raid take 0 damage for 4 seconds, heals still heal damage despite taking 0 of it. 3 charges 40 second cooldown.
---
4) Mesmer now has permanent pet that shoot confusions. Healing power turns into Condi DMG with 25% rate because why stick with usual 13%
---
5) Longbow with 1600 range and damage of melee nuker. And attacks splash heal around targets ("just stop being close to enemies lool 4head") 
---
6) Mesmer now merges with other people, disallowing them to play at all, giving Mesmer second bar with other classes abilities.
---
The first guy played like shit and flames the other build lol. 
---
"We've found dodging to be too hard and unfun of a mechanic. Instead, the new Mesmer elite spec is permanently in a state of evasion! BUT since we didn't want to make it too much like Mirage, you can't cast skills while evading - don't worry, we've made every skill instant!"
---
They're claimed to exist in Tyria, but I ain't never seen one.
---
Also might be Attack of Opportunity and Sic'em.
---
Being an adult means not giving a crap about what anybody thinks about you, or your adorable plushies.
---
You're right about the clip at the start, thief couldn't even aim the skills and then blames the Chrono. 
---
Just think about how much more you could accomplish in life if you just quit your job and stopped sleeping.
---
Keep some stuff in mind
---
* Don't engage more than 5+ enemies till you get the weaver fever
---
* When using sword/dagger Fire and Earth more aoe while Fire and air more single target. Water 2 is oh shit button and theres a dodge skill in utility that is a stun break dont do openworld without it.
---
* Arcane traits in build sections will be life saving. Evasive arcana in water heals and cures condis when you dodge while your main attunement is water. Earth and fire dodges deal decent damage and air blinds. Also the bottom trait in the middle is great for survivability as it will shield you for 3 attacks when you go below 50%.
---
I started again after a 6 month break and returned to the game. Decided to try maining a new class and went for ele. I have not stopped playing weaver since and have almost done 100 map completion after finding the class really fun and versatile. 
---
The only boss where I ever seen consistent and fast cc was in DS meta, where you also do NOT want fast and consistent cc. But otherwhise it is just not something people look out for.
---
That does make me happy. I'm all for **options**.
---
Because Vlast is a boy dragon.
---
where do you work that makes you work 12 hour days every single day? do you make iphones in China or something?
---
I know right? i would have so much more money in GW2!!!!!
---
Looks like One Wolf Pack too with the Long Range shots. 
---
If there's one thing I really love about this game it is that the majority of the maps are absolutely beautiful and fun to explore. I have very few exceptions, and there's really only one map I hate.
---
Exceptions: Lornar's Pass, Dreadgehaunt Cliffs. These two maps are visually okay, but they suffer from something that's not the fault of the map themselves: Dredge. I've never liked fighting the mole people, they're always annoying to tackle, even though they're not overly challenging. They also make really irritating noises when you hit them. These creatures alone make me dread going to either of these two maps where the dredge are very prominent. 
---
So, out of this whole game there is only one map I hate. I absolutely hate it with a fiery passion, and I cannot understand on a human level how some people like it. Tangled Depths. I only go into this map with HP trains, or in the rare mood I feel like doing the meta (which I don't find fun either). Outside of these two things, I do not go to this map. The navigation isn't even the worse part. Mob spam and easily the most challenging HP's in the game just make me hate going here. The mob spam wouldn't even be so bad if the enemies were at least fun to fight. Chak, Mordrem, Mushroom people and Frogs are everywhere. It's a nightmare! I'd rather vacation in Dreadgehaunt Cliffs.
---
A raid with more bosses, good trash segments with unique low chance drops that also explain the lore of the raid. Actual proper difficulty progression with the bosses.
---
Doubt it.
---
It's 2 different players hitting the OP, the Veteran having much higher damage than the other ranger. 
---
I suspect that OP got brought low by the Veteran, while the Invader came in at the last moment and got a couple of shots in. 
---
I have totally missed that.
---
My brother and i have a motorcycle shop&amp;Fix, so i pretty much fix bikes the entire day.
---
Oh my god Akatosh_, you can't just ask someone why they're yellow.
---
One Wolf shows up in combat log. Don't even get me started on that elite.
---
Sadly tutorials won't work. They are not magical answer to all issues in gaming. Lot of gaming communities try to make argument that "if only we had tutorial!"
---
It won't work. People who want to learn, will get the info. People who don't, won't do the tutorials or anything like that.
---
PoF has lot of dodge "tutorials" tho. Awakened perma-slow you if you don't dodge. The rifts in jahal is dodge heaven (or hell).
---
People should learn CC in HoT.
---
It would take major buffing in core tyria enemies if you'd want people to use CC there.
---
Oh your right. Totally missed it was an Invader and Veteran. 
---
Mesmer is Balanced guys. We all know this.
---
There were 0 Mirages in the ToL Final!
---
......
---
Okay, now this is epic
---
Embrace the /s
---
While mesmers were always Anet special child ever since gw1, they are cutting off their corners as evident by the many nerfs and gut of signet of inspiration.
---
Nerfing mirage is dangerous without making the class useless, because their gimmick is dodging, and that's what most people want to do it, and what should be done, because fucking adding mechanics to dodges is always a goddamn bad idea on this game, as we seen with daredevil, though with daredevil they were more glassy and didn't have a shitton of AI to help you, so putting them in a good place was easier. I member immortal perma dodge daredevils, and no one wants a 2.0 version of that with extra damage.
---
TIL
---
Slow internet would like to be sure it's worth trying before I d/l
---
Are professions classes?
---
Absolutely! I really like the uh, "world building via osmosis" in the open world through heart quests, events, ambient dialogue, and strategic lore books/collections. PoF did it excellently, but even the Olmakhan in Episode 2, and Sun's Refuge in Episode 4, had this kinda...atmosphere about them. XD 
---
I personally enjoy going over dialogue transcripts with a magnifying lense, but at the end of the day, it's a fantasy world, not a soliloquy. You can tell players a story without telling them to gather around the campfire and shut up, and Anet does a really good job of weaving the story into the world.
---
&gt;Golems have been buff-able for the last ~3 years. If you buff golems (quickness and stuff) then their damage to objectives is about equal as it was during this event. The only thing they're missing is the supply cost and the superspeed.
---
Another person working together to boost the dmg output of a golem vs a golem just by default being that strong with no need for support (so the other person can just be in another golem just doubling the damage).
---
&gt;And regarding the supply cost - guild golems cost 50 supply. Less than a ram. 2 players can build a guild golem with supply cap.
---
50 sup used to manually build a golem vs throwing a golem down and it materialized fully built for no supply at all.
---
&gt; The second half is **you stating** golems spinning is **worse than double damage**... But then again you didn't even know about the double damage. What can I say? And golem damage to players itself was pretty low.
---
Except is this me actually saying that it was worse or is it you misreading/applying a different meaning to me saying that something was an issue on it's own (ie; not comparing the two)? I was just listing off issues. At no point did I mention one was worse than the other.
---
&gt;So these "big issues" are and have been in the game for years. They're not much weaker in power now than they were during golem week, but not really an issue. Because most players don't actually have the insight or knowledge to understand what is and isn't strong.
---
And how is that relevant? Even if you want to say that they're not much weaker now, how does that hold any relevance to what was a big issue **for it's time**? That would be like me trying to say that Elder Scrolls Oblivion didn't have controversy with the Horse Armor debacle back in the day, because lootboxes are a bigger concern in the modern day. This isn't like a Doctor Who plot, time isn't just mashed together and all taking place at the same time. xD
---
Probably had sic'em and a lot of might on top of probably using skirmishing and/or beastmastery which gives a pretty good bit of ferocity.
---
Embrace the "duuude I wasn't serious lol it's a joke.  (saved)"
---
Wow! That's quality shitposting!
---
Fuck no. Everytime i find an interesting looking asian mmo it tries to stick its p2w cash BS up my a$$. Leave that shit over there please.
---
Please don't give Arenanet ideas. Given how shocking their PvE balance with Chronomancer and Mirage has been I wouldn't be surprised if they took this as a serious and constructive suggestion. 
---
&gt; and gut of signet of inspiration
---
This "gutting" was a kind of a buff in PvP.
---
&gt; Nerfing mirage is dangerous without making the class useless
---
Exactly. Anet is not interested in reworking the spec and to be fair it probably couldn't be done without basically making a new spec. So we're stuck with meaningless nerfs until the next expansion, where it'll go the way of the Berserker - a spec utterly gutted and never to be played again in PvP.
---
Yup
---
Do you have a geared class, know the basic rotation/priority skills of that class and know the mechanics of Vale Guardian?
---
I understood the Sylvari dream like a remnant of Mordremoths influence and not their specific afterlife. Even Sylvari PC's head to the mists after being killed in PoF. And I think they also established the idea that every living being will go there after they die. 
---
This said, maybe ED's are not considered as living beings like every other form of life on Tyria. Maybe they are literately a part of the planet. Otherwise we would have 2 dead elders already in the mists, what seems to be not the case.
---
Yup, doesn't matter though. That shit was silver play. Getting +1'ed on far. Running off to the middle of nowhere to try to secure a kill against a class that has twice your mobility. Getting kited like a silver. Making choices like a silver. Losing because they were playing like silvers.
---
Immunity to CC/ Root for X duration after being affected by one. Duration according to the skill  that was used on you.
---
Mechanic is from Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning.
---
In WAR immunity duration were skill duration x6 for roots - x10 for stuns
---
So if you were stunned for 6s, immunity would last for 60 seconds
---
In GW2 a minute immunity might be too long, so it can be immunity of x2 - x6 duration.
---
ANet would never implement this tho, cause the amount of QQ would be insane.
---
Let the flame begin lul.
---
The only reason we knew PoF was coming was because of the leaks. They've said they'll go straight into next season, but that could be a cover. Anet is a fan of short promotions right before dropping something. Official promo for PoF started like 2 months in advance I believe
---
if everything else fails know that everytime there's a new build (even a with a tiny change) all the map instances are created again, so that's your chance to go and try the event before it stalls again.
---
Generally speaking, I think their worldbuilding is much better than their storytelling, but they actually manage to put out good dialogue more often than not. I think the faults I find with the story are mostly due to the nature of how they've structured the game. Which is a roundabout way of saying I skip over more dialogue than I should. But the worldbuilding via osmos (I'm totally saving that term btw, you coined a good one), that stuff is top tier. I can only aspire to that level of quality.
---
Oh right completely forget we saw sylvari afterlife, good point! And yes, maybe the EDs are considered forces of nature and 'ascension' could be about becoming a living thing
---
i haven't done fractals in a few months. But doing just the t4 daillies with pugs is entirely doable in an hour. 
---
and this is why you are very critic about the performance in a fractal...cant be wasting the little precious time you have for gaming D:
---
In WvW maybe, but in PvP [bunker chrono](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Chronomancer_-_Chronobunker) is more of a 1v1 spec, so the boon sharing was somewhat irrelevant. Before the rework it prolonged boon duration by 3 seconds, now it's 5 which is very important for alacrity/stability uptime as PvP chronos barely have any boon duration stat.
---
There is no real visials for damage spells, considering how much condi SPAM mirages have, it’s ridiculous. There are sounds, but by the time you hear pewpew you alredy have  torment, confusion, bleeding, vulnerability. you cleanse, BAM you get those for again in 2 secs.
---
Don’t give us this bullshit abou “active defense”. Active defense for gw2 is retaliation. Chronos shield 4 maybe. But for mirage it does not apply. You DO BURST DAMAGE using dodge, using jaunt, using blurry. 
---
No other class does that. Some have damaging evades like ranger sword3 or dagger4, but they are never used to burst, they do little damage. The only spec thar comes close is dodge spamming thieves, they just poop condis by dodging. They are not DEFENDING, they are fucking attacking.
---
Even if you can outplay mirage, the level of offert you and your opponent(mirage) have to make is insanely different. Say you r playing LB/GS ranger, mirage just has to watch your animations, they are all there, all perfectly visible. Meanwhile you have to watch for the damn clones’ NAMES, switcharoo/click between illusions and pray for mirage to shit all their condis on you because you cant see shit, so you can finally pop up this single cleansing spell you have. 
---
Even considering all this coming from me, a stupid gold piece of you-know-what, the entry level for visuals only for gw2 pvp is skyhigh (for new players) especially. I guess all these people saying pvp cmirage is fine just dont want their fotm “mains” to get nerfed. Pussies.
---
The first boss is a block of cheese. And the cheese is good.
---
yup, there is always at least 3 or 4 that terrorize my backline or even pick off a light class when we are stacked its so stupid, i dont care if "iTs aPaRt oF ThE gAmE" its still dumb af, it can be both...there is a law in my state that says you cant walk your pet alligator on city streets, its "the law" but its still outdated and dumb
---
Ah, sort of like Ascensions in black desert. I will make sure to see what's available in that case. That sounds pretty cool!
---
lol this guy
---
slight tangent here but i sometimes think "man would it be great to play gw2 right now" during work but when i acually get home my enthusiasm drops because im too tired to enjoy the game
---
Tbh, I have no idea, I don't think we did, although stuff like the ascension wings make me doubt myself. Glint mentioned ascension could only truly be communicated about between dragons, which would be a bit strange if we (in that case ascended) would not be able to understand our own status
---
Well the whole point of the recommendation is using  cheap exotic gear, which you can't use in tier 4 fractals. If you're using ascended anyway, better to build meta so groups have a higher chance of taking you (power dragonhunter is pretty easy to gear and only needs a bit of practice on the rotation)
---
&gt; them
---
I think wooden potatoes, deroir, mmo inks, covered the PoF elites. Not sure on HoT, I think those were ANet livestream. Look on YouTube see what you find!
---
What happens between 7am~8am? 
---
There’s the missing hour for your dailies...
---
Even if only 10% of experienced groups upload logs there (and I play in at least 2 xp groups that do) the 95th percentile stat wise would still reflect xp groups. 
---
In reality, the 95 - 99 percentile it's a very good target for most people. If you're getting that, no pugs will have issues with you.
---
half the video is about chrono though lmao
---
Light armor hammer user on the left. Forgemaster necro pls, smash the ground to create minions or summon skeletons, kthx
---
Path of Exile is similar, but it's a top-down dungeon crawler in the vein of Diablo.  Perhaps something else to try.  It can be really fun and addictive when you get into it.  
---
My sister once got bitten by a moose.
---
Lmao I'm about to make a thief and pick female sylvari. So add that vote to the pile.
---
something something 30min video inc
---
if my static took 50mins for fotm Id just quit lmao
---
Yep.  I don’t work 12 hour days, but yep. 
---
Unblockable projectiles can't be reflected nor destroyed in any way.
---
Somewhat. Lamp team has a rather boring job down in there, not seeing much of a boss fight until the wyvern are basically done. But Quadim is certainly one of the more interesting Bosses.
---
the 1-hour fap session tho.
---
I would offer u my protection but i feel ull say no :(.
---
Cringe Wars 2
---
That's a good description, thanks! I feel a little more fulfilled. Have a sip of karma!
---
this
---
WvW new system is being developped. Can't remember when Anet first talked about it. It's all about guild alliance system and no more server with another against other servers.
---
The Charr in the picture is a WvW dedicated tonic. It was in the toy panel when they released it. But was erased then. So, you can not preview it anymore.
---
to tell us how gw2 sucks. what else?
---
That's me about everything basically
---
Thank you so much for all of this! And yeah, any mote advice he has would be super appreciated!
---
this hits too close to home
---
Man, your weekend is weird
---
I heard guildwars has this amazing piece of content called the "Fissure of Woe". Sounds perfect!
---
Mt Hyjal style wave defense with upgradable turrets, walls, etc. bring in mechanics from the Verdant Brink nighttime meta for creating barricades and other defenses.
---
Maybe pair with a lane push along side NPC allies to a boss 
---
&gt; just the thrill of murdering the slow, the stupid, and the upleveled.
---
so.. roamers who hide in a zerg
---
:D
---
What's your point with this though?
---
Chrono is a hard bunker class, thief cannot kill a proper chronobunker. Also Jaw really messed up there (he plays holo anyways). Don't think you can draw any conclusion from that.
---
ROM was playing LB/GS SB which is LITERALLY hardcountered by condi mirage. So if you wanted to make a point how amazing ROM plays are, you are right. Moreover it was 1v2 at the end. Evasive Mirror is just retarded with mirage mechanics, if there is anything to nerf, that's it.
---
I see you're a man of culture as well.
---
YATANGAKI.. AAAAAAAYA !
---
Too tired to enjoy anything after work... 
---
Feel free to ask me things as well. Online several hours daily usually. On EU.
---
Friend details are in my flair. :)
---
Nothing serious. Just a video
---
I see no Raid weekday.
---
Nice idea, but your indication is a bit misleading and tells us exactly nothing about the classes performance. For example... Power and Condi damage. Do you only consider the accessibility for each class regarding trait lines and weapons or did you try to picture the actual use ingame?
---
I would also split core classes from elite specs because some of them add features to a class that was not there before. While core Ele maybe has 1 star in healing, Tempest should have 3. The same with Guardian. Core and Firebrand may be around 2 to 3 stars of healing, while Dragonhunter has nothing to add.
---
And the 3 star system is not a really good pick either. Stars in general... If you want to go with stars, take 5 to better show the variances between classes.
---
cos discord, skype, facebook, linkedin or any number of corporate online chatrooms dont exist. . . .
---
I mean the first guy legit had no point. He is playing thief (a class infamous for being absolutely terrible at 1v1ing), and still almost got the mesmer until he started missing every single skill he has.
---
That is looking at them in Pala, they exist in plenty of other places and the skill is not a bad design (which is what op is claiming) could you say pala is? But if people are "brain off" farming events and die to an attack they could stop if they were "brain on" playing you can't call the attack bad
---
Personally I think of the attack the most at the deadhouse since that is one of the first places I remember encountering it and that event doesn't get scaled up to hell. And again people do know how to cc since the last boss of the meta is often CC'd.
---
I get a little ranty since CC has been an issue plaguing events for nearly half of the games life and people will always claim it is new players that don't know how to CC and that is why CC doesn't happen.
---
You have some good points about the game not providing a good explanation of what CC is but you can go to any event and someone is shouting CC and you will find that just saying that has more of an effect than not saying, so knowledge of what CC exists and for those that don't know what it is should ask or look it up if there is players shouting it at each event. And it really isn't that complex, unless there is some meta or strat involving breakbars which is rarely seen, it is pretty much see a blue bar use knockbacks, stuns, launches, floats, dazes, fears and taunts. Immobilize, chill, cripple, vuln, weakness, blind and slow in a lot of cases aren't as worth thinking about unless you have multiple of them and/or are doing something solo since they tend to get be present in a lot of group content and are only really useful for the enemies with constant blue bars.
---
The game doesn't teach you how to deal with enemies but you learn by playing, looking up info and asking other player. Learning how and what attacks enemies have and dealing with them is just a part of the game, I have played enough of this game that I have just learnt what most enemies movesets are and how to deal with them, through just playing. Learning to CC is just a part of that too, you don't have to be an expert at the game but if an enemy swirls you around and instakills you maybe you should look into ways to stop or avoid that, learn from what happened but instead people go to reddit or the forums and make threads about how hard it is or it is a mechanic with no counterplay and it bad game design.
---
And we can't keep making excuses for people not CC, "it is open world people just press 1", "New players don't know how to CC", "But my build doesn't have CC", "4 seconds isn't long enough to CC", "the game never taught me to CC". The game isn't a clicker game if is too hard for you to actively play then play something simpler, Not all people in the game are new players, Adapt your build to what you are doing, 4 seconds to stop a large attack is plenty of time, Go learn to CC then.
---
There does need to be a tutorial for CC, the devs know that and have said they have been exploring ideas, I think there was even a thing in the last episode where you had to CC something to progress. The idea I had for that was to add an actual wall you have to CC through to get to that content and stop players from progressing any further until they have CC'd it.
---
High five to my fellow adult man with a teddy bear!
---
Yeah, use all of your cooldowns to negate auto attacks. That's top tier gameplay, doods. 
---
Posting a picture about prefering GW2 in the GW2 sub. What do expect?
---
Oh okay. It's always fun to watch ROM :)

if i play necro i want to choose reaper with GS \^\^ thank you for ur reply

OP did not state they complete them, just that loading screen takes 50 minutes 
---
&gt; We haven't died __again__ yet
---
That's the correct build, and I'm almost certain someone was being a dick and exaggerating that you're doing "eight hundred DPS" with that. Dragonhunter rotation is an order-based rotation, but just mashing all the buttons should still get you above 10k with boons. 
---
The opener for Dragonhunter is: Lay a trap, f1 your target, put down a symbol, use the elite trap, Greatsword 2, weapon swap, use scepter 2 and spirit sword on cooldown until you can go back into Greatsword.
---
Your general priorities are using your big damage skills (Whirling Wrath, Procession of Blades, etc) while the enemy is both standing in your Symbol and tethered to you via Spear of Justice.
---
oof
---
that was balt, not kralk. doesn't count
---
&gt; At the end of the day, anything it can do, someone else can do better plus something else.
---
It was really bad after Revenant first landed. It could do everything warrior could do, except bannerslave (a facet of warrior I really resent out of high level play).  
---
Now, Warrior is just sort of a baseline profession; decent, but not great, enough unique utility to justify bringing, but the Elite specs are just kinda.. eh. 
---
Yeah i go for that healthy 9-5 work, 5:30-1 game and rest sleeping :) 
---
That's what I think I do:) Ty!
---
Any refinery work here is 10hr day 5 day week as standard during regular operation. With optional overtime being rotated around the crew members for weekend shifts. Then there's shutdowns which usually only last 4-8 weeks and your shift switches to something like 12 days on 2 off, out of town, so you everyone always opts for the 12 hour days at that point and make bank.
---
I was clearing $2,200 a week after tax and I was just a peasant labourer. Boilermakers and pipe fitters especially and other skilled trades could easily clear between 3-4k a week, again, after tax. Oh and have I mentioned full benefits from day 1? Medical, dental, hell I even had half my laser eye surgery covered by those benefits. 
---
While that money sounds fucking amazing, and it is, I found almost everyone I worked with to be insufferable to the point that I couldn't be paid enough to deal with it. Working with primarily 45+ year old mostly white "macho" men the amount of racism, sexism, backstabbing, dick swinging, work political bullshit was one of the biggest stress factors in trying to kill myself. Once you're making that money it's hard to leave and I struggled for a long time, and still do, about where my life is. Do I stay for the money and hate everyone around me and think about jumping off the top of a Coker? Or do I leave the industry altogether, take significantly less pay (or no pay at all while I'm in school other than maybe part time at min wage somewhere) to pursue something I might actually be interested in? Now I'm mid 20's living with my parents and nearly broke hoping I get accepted into my EMT course this September. If I don't get accepted... Idk at this point. I won't try to kill myself again, I love my girlfriend and possible future with her to ever do that. But how do I even get to that future? I honestly have no fucking idea and I'm terrified.
---
Sorry for the rant at the end I guess I just needed to vent. Point is long weeks are fine in moderation if your paid and treated fairly and it's not destroying you mentally, I guess.
---
Necro is terrible for roaming, pretty much everyone will destroy you. 
---
This, pretty much. Not to mention that King county does not have the infrastructure to handle this kind of weather in a timely manner. A lot of our schools and businesses were shut down for days, while employees were stuck at home because if you weren't on a critical/main road, tough luck. 
---
I'd say go ahead and try it out on the golem (don't forget to put vuln on the golem and boons on yourself!) in the Raid Training area. If you're nervous about installing Arc yourself, the raid training area has a less-useful but still-present DPS meter built in.
---
Alternatively, you could do Fractals with me and I could keep an eye on your DPS. Add Gisae (drdevicemd.3158) to your friends list, if you message me in game and I'm not raiding or something I'll be happy to do T4 with you.
---
didn't mean that gw is not an mmorpg
---
Oh man, I appreciate how well you plan out your sleep schedule! I often lose track of time having fun and time flies by suddenly becoming 1am. Then I have to wake up at 6am :|
---
Soft CC from skills also consume it over time. 
---
If the boss has a weak scaling, the bar will evetually break from skill spam.
---
If people brought and used CC properly, the defiance bar would last much longer, and the boss get much more damage from the vulnerability effect.
---
Nice, though the Asura should've been strumming on an instrument. Aaand... isn't the Frostgorge Sound trail still coming back every now and then, when the rewards spike?
---
Have an inflatable pool in front of your desk, fill with 95% water 5% rubbing alcohol, sit in pool while doing fotm. No need to wipe with wet wipes.

&gt;Kralk shows up in the mists

Vlast: Oh my god. Seriously? All I wanted was some god damn peace and quiet! That's it, I'm out of here. I'll go back to Tyria.
---
And so he went back...somewhere he knew he'd rarely be bothered: an old LS map.
---
I pug daily and T4 + recs takes about an hour or so. 50 min seems legit... how long does it take you?
---
lmao
---
&gt; so I guess that's clear evidence that unicorns exist on earth!
---
There are references in Tyrias **history**, not mythology about horses; be serious. Also, there have been numberous NPC references.
---
&gt; he asuran portal could have been to any alternate dimension, or even to earth.
---
I don't know why you find horses more ridiculous that what you just said.
---
&gt; It seems rather silly to insist that the observable world is wrong based on a handful of apocryphal references that don't even truly prove anything.
---
What if I told you that the "observable world" is limited, because of limited dev time? As I said, we don't see the whole of Tyria. It's not possible. Some conclusions have to be made out of NPC and written references.
---
that's not how KD works
---
Is it a Laptop ? Gw2 has a problem where it launches with integrated gpu rather than your main gpu so may have to adjust some settings if so. 
---
oof my ass, that's my own post lol 
---
PvP has had balance like this since before the seasons even started. They promote skill spam with short CDs, overload abilities with too much damage or too many effects. I mean watching these clips you see just how much of a clusterfuck it is.
---
Yeah, biggest mistake for a newer mesmer, but those skills are your b&amp;b. Even a no clone distortion can act as a quick little dodge. A three clone distortion can save your butt big time. Your F3 shatter is a huge stun and the only thing that does great against break bars and if you're using the dueling trait line for the confusion on blind and interrupt and blind on shatter you can stack a bit of extra confusion on the enemy as well. 
---
It would be really cool to use Guardian hammer in PvE content to golf swing an opponent off a cliff, killing it. Or use shield to knock 5 off simultaneously killing all of them.
---
an hour if we are fast but usually over an hour to 1.5 hours. I always was pleasantly surprised when we could do it in barely an hour but it was rare.

Though I might add that I was always looking for whoever wanted to join and not be specific.

It's good to live near workplace
---
I know, but why the ultra low effort repost? It wasn't even a well received post the first time.
---
three and a half cries for help
---
At some point you'll be too tired to even watch people play gw2.
---
While I agree that removing Revealed is troublesome and no more skills other than Shadow Meld should ever remove it again, changing shadow meld alone would not address the other gameplay and design issues that stealth has.
---
It's stealth itself what has to change. 
---
With a proper stealth rework, you could even have permanent stealth effects, like an elite thief signet that pulses 3s stealth every 3 second; longer stealth durations in skills, and way more sources of revealed. 
---
These things I think changes like [these four](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/762415/#Comment_762415) would do the trick. Making those changes would not instantly fix the problems with stealth on their own, but it would add the mechanics and variable factors that would allow balancing it better in the future. Stealth would work better for those using it and those facing enemies that use it, and it would promote less gimmicky and more skill skill-based gameplay. 
---
Why did you chase a class that has superior mobility into the middle of nowhere on the map? Then proceed to be kited like you're silver. I know you aren't silver, so why did you make such bad choices?
---
https://youtu.be/e-omrSwN3Ho 
---
I hope this will ease your mind my friend. Gods be with you. 
---
This is why I go to the gym before work and it could apply to GW2 as well. Just wake up earlier, use your energy on what you enjoy, then go to work tired and go to bed early (shortly after work).
---
did you download the latest version and went through troubleshooting?    
---
for me the first launch of the game with dx12 went like yours, then I went through the troubleshooting and restarted the game twice, now it runs perfect and much better than before  
---
I found Wow give content at a lesser speed and still have monthly sub.
---
Knockback! Knockback! Knockback!
---
Oh, the joy of facing LB4. Not to mention all the times FRIENDLY rangers push enemies out of your AOE...
---
I'm not qualified to say anything to anyone about anything ever, but if we set that aside for a moment, my one major word of advice to you would be that it's not how are "you" (singular) get to that future. It's how "you" (plural) do it. If she's part of a future with you, then the two of you will get there *together* or not at all.
---
The TL;DR is that you're talking a lot like you think you have to do it all yourself but the truth is that you don't, and that no amount of stress and worry is going to make the future change. Just keep doing what you can and trying to make the right decisions. That's all you *can* do, so don't worry about anything else.
---
Yeah, I just run a Reaper for open world/story and my Mesmer for any group content. 
---
I would love to run Mesmer for everything but my IQ isn't high enough. I need something braindead for solo.
---
Come join us in wvw and adjust your sleep schedule to about 5 hours a night!

For all you know, OP is running multiple fractals.

Water meta builds spring up overnight lmao

None of these classes can hit you that quickly for the numbers seen in the screenshot from 1800 range with an unblockable modifier, though. 
---
Scrolled down to see this.
---
You understand why they get kicked out tho right? 
---
Or also from earlier in the week "nobody said anything update was coming on Tuesday, of course it will be Thursdayon the WvW stream shut up and wait"
---
People treat WvW'ers like shit around here
---
One that's out in 3 month with each living world episode which is an actual reasonable time to release raids wings in.
---
oof because it's really sad how desperate you look reposting your own stuff from over half a year ago to get some attention or whatever. oof.
---
&gt; It effects the ranger when you merge with the pet right?
---
Correct indeed, any effect that the pet would gain the soulbeast gets it instead when merged.
---
My job is actually 12 hours a night so I can only game on off days sense I have to sleep between shifts during the day

But where's the sheer fun of farming then? Don't you think it's fun to do something totally basic and absolutely repetitive for hours?
---
Nah, I'm pretty sure it's because despite playing heavy Condi clear builds I'm still taking 30k damage from burning.
---
Revenant says high
---
Reminds me of myself...
---
Last christmas my static fractal group kinda died tho. This year I only did fractals like 5 times and it honestly feels great. 
---
that longbow that I waited for since 2015 and had everything prepared for since dec of 2017 really just killed the game for me. 
---
Stale game since pof
---
!wp2
---
I actually really did enjoy fractal 40 farm, since it almost felt like a mini-raid. I haven’t been able to find anything as entertaining :(
---
Ran into something similar in PvP, full glass soulbeast hitting me for 17k with his GS and crazy bow damage. Except it's a terrible build because you just dodge into him to avoid the damage and then 1 shot him back. 
---
*If* we're strictly talking about opium world trash mobs, maybe with a veteran or two thrown in, I have never had much of a problem up to maybe 6-7 of them, with running axe/torch, axe/pistol. Start in torch. 
---
Raptor engage, 4, 5, 2, Jaunt out of the center of the group, 2 (if you're not traited to generate clones on deception),  dodge/ambush, crystal sands/ambush, swap, dodge/ambush, F1, (Jaunt, 2)...reverse order if you clone on deception, 4, 5, 2, dodge/ambush, swap, dodge/ambush, F1.
---
Lather, rinse, repeat.
---
Something like this gives you a ton of evade frames, absolutely shits axes everywhere, juggles cooldowns pretty well, and lets you get in a few shatters as well, but only when you have skills to get your phantasms and clones right back out there.
---
This rotation is also pretty stingy with Jaunts, letting you save one or more just in case you need a quick dodge but your endurance is low from generating ambushes.
---
The rotation is also just the most efficient result of balancing various goals, so you don't need to adhere to it strictly, like you might for a Weaver.
---
Basically, your skill use rationale is this:
---
If you have no clones out, priority one is changing that. Get your clones out. You have axe 2, both of your phantasm skills on pistol 4 and torch 5, as well as a free clone every time you use jaunt...IF you have one already out. So if you're traited for it, never use Jaunt without having at least one clone out (unless you're just using it to escape).
---
Once you're generating clones, priority 2 is to generate ambush attacks. You do this with dodges and the mirror from crystal sands. Keeping in mind that your ambush damage greatly increases with more clones out (with the trait), you want to try to maximize the amount of ambushes you use when you've got all 3 out. 
---
So if it's not an emergency, you want to go clone, phantasm, jaunt clone. Fill in while your phantasm turns into a clone with an AA chain or axe 3 to evade an incoming attack, then you're in ambush mode.
---
Dodge, ambush, (AA to let the attack finish), crystal sands, ambush, (AA to let the attack finish), dodge, ambush, swap (to get half your endurance back thanks to sigil of energy. You're almost constantly invulnerable in this spike damage phase thanks to all the dodging and crystal touching, but if you need another evade, there's always axe 3.
---
Once you've done your triple ambush, you should have your axe 2 mostly back, plus your new offhand phantasm, so that's 2 out of 3 of your next batch of clones ready to go, so shatter. F3 if you are dealing with a break bar, otherwise, F1.
---
Then you literally just start over. A few simple phases, split up with key skill use.
---
Generate a full 3 clones, shit out axes while evading everything, swap, shatter, and start over.
---
Those seven (7) day work-weeks suck. 
---
I've been playing the hell out of Apex legends. It's awesome.
---
What about the hour between sleep and work?
---
Still meta in fractals, but the previously-incomparable druid/chrono support combo now has competition in the form of quickness firebrand/alacrity renegade (the latter being superior in organized groups).
---
Is it even worth living like this? 
---
I use the same title since my first post. 
---
Somebody made a joke about how people in the Vabbi server  are (not) playing (well) meta builds... And then I kept using this title because of this. :-)
---
Technically GW1 is not a mmo, an online rpg sure but not an mmo. 
---
Free karma? 
---
Not really. Plasma is helpful, yes, but youre ultimately still the squishiest class with the lowest damage and little utility. Especially after the plasma nerf.
---
it's even better when you know spanish and realize that the "joke" he's telling doesn't doesn't really make you laugh. You laugh of the way he laughs.
---
Riot's always been the gold standard, weirdly - even back to their early seasons and popularity explosion, they had a very well crafted tone, and for the most part did a good job explaining themselves without being too stuffy about it.
---
I mean, a lot of the issues like lack of communication or bad customer service are... Sadly sort of par for the course at this point - and I also get that two data points does not make a trend, but I'm still wary of more instances of direct public snark, because it's just that little bit over a personal line for me.
---
Classic
---
Dunno guardian burning damage is usually deserved because of how concentrated their damage is in that single condi and how few cover condi they have. Mirage burning isn't super bursty unless you have somehow forgotten how to press your dodge button. 
---
The thing is, you need to aim this on them, as this is exactly what commanders ask them to do - create their own parties/squads and do havoc around, and keeping main squad free for squad classes. 
---
But they don't listen and join/stay anyways. Then all that is left is kick.
---
No where was I referencing Tuesday....they said it was coming this week. The people who said it still streamed, but no announcement. But this is the norm in the relationship between players and the WvW devs/team.
---
For instance i quit sleeping ;-) 
---
AQ40
---
And Ulduar kind of? I really liked both of those
---
you can play both gw2 and apex perfectly fine there are different enough to stand on their own
---
No, it is because you aren't seem to be able to summarize direct damage done by multiple skills, while condi damage done by the same amount of attacks gets summarized for you. This is quite a common thing tho, along with inability to understand that condi damage doesn't magically occur on it's own, but is inflicted with the same kind of  avoidable  skills as power one. Pretty sad.
---
Current pvp meta is *heavily* power-based. 80+% of the damage you are taking is power. 
---
if you want raiding to die out sure and ignore the example of literally any other mmo with raids, sure
---
literally every other mmo with raids has a form of this, but as always the GW2 community is *very special* and wants their raiding scene to die out. 
---
doesnt take a big brain to see that the raiding scene is shrinking. 
---
I mean, just because you're being a condescending jerk to a stranger for no reason, I'd like to point out that there were no such thing as "mirages" during Golem Week, Mr Knows-Everything-Better-Than-Everyone-Else
---
Dodge? And disengage
---
Probably, i never made it into either :( i am thinking ocarina of time castle where you need to open the staircase and you have to clear 7 temple themed rooms
---
It would still help for you to include NA or EU. Though your sign off make makes me think you are in EU.
---
are you dumb or did you miss the part where he asked 'in your opinion'
---
But what if the squad isn't full? Isn't it better to have them than not have them? The group setting could prioritize zerg classes, for them to receive most support. Also, isn't making a second roaming squad in cooperation with the main squad better than just kick them? I am playing WvW semi-casually, so correct me if I'm wrong.
---
You already have indication if the heart was done before.

If I finished all the PoF stories in 1 character, can I get Griffon on another char?
---
I can use Teleport to open up WP, etc. I already have the Spearmarshal's Plea on my new main.
---
Oh don't get me wrong, I understand the should be some frustration, but at the same time the over the top level of anger displayed by some seems rather silly to me considering the circumstances. 
---
You definitely don't need 80%, and extra boon duration helps only a tiny bit. The vast majority of your the boon duration still comes from the SoI from both chronos. 
---
Practising the rotation will give you a much better return on investment than getting temporary gear with more concentration than you need.
---
When you complete a repeatable heart, it gets a fancy border with the infinity symbol for future completions. It's a bit more subtle than a color change, but what you want already exists.
---
Warrior has to close the gap, thief is laughably squishy and easily locked down, guard does not hit that much in a single shot no matter what and also has to gap close, mesmer has to use a multi skill combo that is easily avoided,  rev can't hit that hard and has to gap close (cor is laughable outside of a zerg where this soulbeast likely was). The big difference between the picture and your comment is that none of the classes you listed can do that absurd damage safely at 2k range using auto attacks. Notice that skill in the middle of his log is an auto attack that does 8k damage. That's normal in wvw for soulbeast. You can delete certain classes without them having a hope of ever even reaching a range their class can participate in. Then if you do get in range soulbeast has stability, great regen, blocks, evades, stealth, and a cqb burst that one skill crit 17k in marauders. Not even comparable. 
---
I doubt it's the actual writing of the post that's delayed, but rather final touches on the development of the thing that's being announced getting pushed back a bit. 
---
This is great and all; I really appreciate it.
---
But my entire point is why do this when I can go Reaper and just Shroud 4 then autoattack to achieve the exact same thing with siginificantly less effort?
---
I guess this is why GW2 lets you use alts so easily!

Absolutely
---
What bad weather? i checked the weather in their state.. it aint even snowing or raining outside... its like 40 degrees. PHONEY. Stop adding PvE content to WvW we all know its going to be crap.
---
Ok... Let me put it in another way. Kits replace the weapon skills of your character. The same happens with conjure weapons on ele. I am pretty sure both work the same technically, but just named differently. So your initial argument that Engi is the only one with that kind of gameplay, and therefore it's one of their main "mechanics", is wrong.
---
You said yourself that kits are only one "mechanic" of Engi. So telling people you can't play your Engi, or can't get an feeling for the class because you choose not to use only one of the main "mechanics", is wrong as well. If it is only one part of the class, it can't be the defining aspect for it at the same time. Also considering what I said above... Conjure weapons are pretty much the same thing already.
---
The term "Kit" is unique to Engi. But the functionality behind it isn't.
---
Leaving build discussion out of all of this and only focusing on what engi kit abilities really are, in context of the games combat system, then they are utility skills. Again, mechanics are class defining things only this class has access to like the toolbelt. And not a type of skill that can be easily put on other classes and, in this particular example, already happened with conjure weapons. There is a difference between class features and class mechanic.
---
And to get back on your "it's directly referenced in game descriptions for the class made by devs themselves" argument... So are mantras for mesmers, wells for necros, conjuring for ele (oh whoops... the "mechanic" that works almost the same as kits) and ambush for thiefs. And still, all of these things are not unique to their classes anymore. I think that should sum up how accurate the devs documentation of classes from 2012 today is.

He grew up in Kesho, and the ambient magic there was likely yellow.

Most of Aurene's magic came directly from a leyline surge, so she got more leyline-like colors.

Yes and no. If you complete a heart and wait for tomorrow, the compass will take you to the heart that you already completed once.

Glint getting cleansed of the brand corruption in Arah might have changed her from purple to blue though.

---
&gt;I just found reaper to be incredibly plodding and one dimensional.
---
Hey, that's why I play it! 
---
&gt;your entire argument is, essentially, "I don't like mesmer because it's not a reaper."
---
I'm not. I like Mesmer, I use it for Fractals and Raiding ^^because ^^nobody ^^else ^^will ^^play ^^it. I use two different classes for two different types of content. I didn't say I didn't like Mesmer as a whole, I only said that I disliked its inability to effortlessly cleave. As you perfectly explained in your rotation comment, there's a lot of buttons to press in order to kill a group.
---
&gt;I mean...the logical conclusion of your posts is that what you really want is for all classes other than reaper to not exist, since you want them all to be the same anyway. 
---
Where did I say this? All I'm arguing is that Reaper is significantly easier to play than Mesmer in open world content. I don't think anybody can deny that fact.
---
The level of entitlement here. 
---
You do realize that they may have wanted developers on hand during the announcement to answer questions and provide insight.  Something they couldn't do if half the workforce is at home due to weather.
---
If you can't wait one week after 5 years, you have bigger issues than this announcement.  Chill guys, it's a game.
---
I agree! All professions can do a massive DPS burst in about a second, but everyone are just complaining about Rangers, Mesmers and one-shot Thieves.
---
"Frailty/sugar rush bad? Just run double heals "

OK. I'm done! I can't anymore, no matter how many people will try to put some common sense into why the current instabilities are annoying ( NOT HARD ) to deal with there is always someone like this guy that just blows my mind with his "unpopular opinion".

The lack of communication is incredibly frustrating.  Anet says absolutely nothing about their plans going forward nor do they ever explain their reasoning for change, even at a high level.  We sit here wondering what their vision for the game is going forward: will there be more raids after wing 7?  Is season 5 next?  What do they have planned for WvW or PvP? etc.  I have not seen a company this silent about literally everything since online gaming was a thing.
---
They even go so far as to ignore anything and everything in their streams/AMA's that even remotely ask about the future of the game.  They respond to only fluff comments like "What's your favorite quaggan?" and praise comments.  It's incredibly disheartening and pretty ridiculous from an MMO company in 2019.
---
Dont make me blush :\*)
---
I've been playing power LB Ranger in WvW blob fights very long time and have found it really good tagging tool (especially good with pet Jacaranda). Just pop out all unblockable traits and skills, and start shooting to the center of an enemy blob. Keep the pressure up until enemy blob comes too close or arrows start reflecting back, then use superspeed and run away. Come back when cooldowns are gone and start shooting again. Pick up lost enemy players if there is any and downed enemies. Jacaranda might die, just merge and unmerge to make it alive again.
---
It is very fun and safe unlike melee builds who die in a nanosecond when an enemy blob runs over. At least in my experience.
---
When do you run this?
---
The game has entered the retirement home. We’ll visit it on holidays. 
---
If kitless holo is a meme than so is condi lol. If you want to be hard meta then there's only 1 holo build for pve. Even still it's not tri kit like vanilla.

Yup correct even the pvp mirage has quite a bit of power damage. But you know people rather complain about condi until it's compleatly useless again.

Look what he has on his utilitie bar says it all.

That's the excuse I also use the when I play poorly. I don't stream though and it is normally just to make me feel better.

*Well maybe someone else found it amusing that I fell off the Deimos platform as the handkiter...*
---
My only issue with repeatable hears is that is has a huge priority over other points of interests for map completion in the UI.
---
When you turn on the UI to show the nearest PoI, Vista, etc ... it shows a heart across the map bu not the vista 3 pixels behind you. 
---
Love it.
---
Phoenix rise up! Agreed the visual noise in gw2 is annoying and then on the flipside condi builds have hardly any indicators. If you take one or two sec too long to clear condis you just die and wonder what happened :P
---
No! Because Lulu is terrible endgame so I didn’t even bother :D
---
&gt;stability has used stacks instead of duration since like...2014.
---
Nope.  I remember when Stab was still duration-based in the beginning of 2017.  It wasn't until around Spring I think that they changed it.
---
Apex is fun.
---
But i still like more wvw. I dont know a game mode similar to wvw in another game.
---
old meme
---
Anet is working on new game and dev power has been moved away. What they said recently is exactly what we get. And nothing else. Living story + some features. I do not believe this game will see another expansion.
---
Gw2 is not dying, it has healthy playerbase and some content to come. But its definitely not going to grow or even aspire to being anything beyond what we have today.

---
it could be because the game is no longer fun
---
Why do you have to work 12 hours a day, jesus fuck
---
1. plot convenience, 2. my poor baby just wanted to sleep
---
Cool. Yeah that's an option. Imo the best scenario would be if a second commander tagged up as focus squad, where all the non meta classes would just focus on enemy backliners.
---
I miss the days when thieves, mesmers and other classes where dedicated backline gankers. 
---
They should add balloons that spawn with Birds. If, at the end of the fractal, you have been hit by more birds than you have collected balloons, you don't get any rewards.
---
The only reocuring ones are the reflect and carrying poisen/fire fields out of the way. The rest is "just" standard gameplay aka dodging what might harm you and pressing your CC skills when the bar appears.
---
There is enough players who still dont know how they avoid falling on their nose during the storm phase and it doesnt matter much, if others have an eye for that. (a group wide stacking where everyone would fall flat would probably be something more fun/annoying)
---
But yes, Sloth and Matthias are both bosses where everyone has to do something other than standing at the boss, while watching netflix on the other screen. They are still both in my top 5 boss list. Especially Sloth. Have a lot of fun memories on the various "Slippery Slubling" titles we did in our guild.
---
&gt;and thats what they are working on: https://dd.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aos4oz/insight_of_what_is_being_worked_on/eg3550j/
---
Yes but i would very much like them to announce that on their twitch channel instead of pictures of random quaggans. And not get thrown at us through random reddit comment.
---
the anger in this thread about not getting an announcement is hilarious. you guys need to go outside.
---
There's no reason to expect it to die after ls5 is over, you are right. It's going to die after ls4 is over, unless they've been waiting for this season to end before announcing something big.
---
I am 100% convinced they are working on another game behind the scenes. 
---
there is no way a company that large can be so incompetent at producing content (see 2 hours of content every 3 months)
---
Let's just hope whatever game they are working on is a proper sequel to Guild Wars this time around
---
They did.  You don't have to finish it all in one day.  You don't even have to finish the heart all in one day, cause it even keeps your completion over reset.
---
Is the intent to have a game in the GW setting or have a game in the computer code limitations of the game?
---
My group sends the second chrono into the lamp, and banner tanks pat. It's a nice change of pace.

Awesome - I'll definitely look here. I have the MTC conversions and Ravnica, but I'll also check out Eberron. Now just to read them!

Come back anytime ;-) we'll provide you a better experience.
---
Given the updates and changes they've talked about, and where we are in the story, I feel like they're just waiting for Episode 6 to arrive so we have an idea where the story is going.  That way, they can discuss their plans in much more detail without having to dodge spoilers at every turn and so the announcements don't take away from the hype of Episode 6.
---
If they don't start opening discussion after LS4 is concluded, then I'll start getting upset. But right now, I can see their reasoning for letting things wait.  A lot seems to be in the works.
---
&gt; the idea of Living Story is great but I personally think it gets pale after a while
---
They're working to improve Living Story updates.  They have a new system in place to make those bigger, better, and more efficient, and have plans to add expansion content to the Living Story.  So if all works out, this won't be a complaint anymore.
---
I disagree but I respect your opinion.
---
I do believe that overall WvW balance in a joke and the gamemode could use some across the board nerf, as I believe skills in general do too much damage in that mode and people die too fast. 
---
But I'm also one of the few people I know who believes WvW would be better if downed state was also removed, so what do I know.
---
Hey, every bit helps! Thanks!
---
&gt; But I guess what he means is that he can't remember which of the 3-4 hearts he didn't do the day before, because there's literally no way to keep track of that at all
---
the icon is clearly different for those that you've completed in the past.
---
I unfortunately don't know how to change the title. Forgot about it. Sorry about that.
---
Technically you are playing a character you made, so it is a role playing game. If you want to differentiate from the RP you should call it mmoarpg. But in either case it changes nothing. 
---
I feel bad for them.  It was 66° last night in Hawaii, and we had to sleep with 3 blankets.  Can't imagine having to work while it's snowing.
---
Source? 
---
There's also the issue that humans only do so well with crunch, where computers can handle it easily. After thinking for a while, I honestly may lean more towards making a thematic book for the setting (giving all sorts of background and lore) and then expand to either a conversion "expansion" for system specifics, or just make system specific version later.
---
Glad to hear that other projects exist! If you want /need to collaborate in the lore specific areas, feel free.
---
Yeah, no worries. I just wasn't sure if I had missed something.
---
It has been interesting to see how each Elder Dragon has been made to communicate.  Like you said, Zhaitan spoke through his minions.  Mordremoth is the only one who, so far, has had his own distinct voice due to his power of mind.
---
So will all Elder Dragons eventually speak in some way? Or will some of them remain silent to reinforce their uncompromising nature?
---
I mean, we have a great example just yesterday as to why to whole lack of communication is actually a thing: They mentioned, off-hand, last week that there would be a WvW announcement this week.
---
This week, they informed us that due to circumstances out of their control (the weather) they would postpone the announcement until next week. 
---
And all hell broke loose and people behaved like little kids and were incredibly abusive. 
---
Errr what? If you use F1 you lose 10% damage modifier and get "one full dps" or "one full support" that would die otherwise!
---
Totally worth it!
---
When i play FB i interrupt my rotation all the time to pop books or weapon swap to cc moar if i'm running axe on swap.
---
I didn't know that till today, so it's possible most people don't.  (looking at it now that I know, I can see how it's different, but I never noticed how it changed before today.)
---
Sorry for the (probably) dumb question, but what troubleshooting? I only find the explanations of the problem but no solution...tried some things that I found about it but still have the same, pixalated, image :/
---
Right - the overall goal, I think, would be to make the game world come alive without making things too complex for the players. I like the example btw!
---
I bet their new game is going to be mobile and i5s purpose will not be replacing gw2.
---
...I forgot about those goddamn gulls. They have already been borrowing ideas from FFX...
---
What's the best timing to do this? Are these events scheduled like world bosses?
---
So often. 
---
What I've found is that the game is fun but I'm not. Coming back from work I'm sometimes too tired to enjoy anything and I'm also not a joy to be around. Times like that I just need to deactivate and recharge.
---
On the other hand, anything can be cheesy in the eyes of your enemy. Just you wait for comments when I say I play Holosmith.
---
Hey! 
---
I got inspired to draw some phone art about warriors in pvp. A common meme in pvp discord I am in is that Rampage is keeping the warrior viable in ranked pvp. So I though it was a fun idea to draw this before we see how Anet will handle the next balance patch.
---
Stealth classes are another can of worms to open up, which ranger also has access to through smokescale blasts and longbow 3. Even the terrible tower rangers are a problem in this meta because they can legitimately hit you hard enough in one burst that you die or are forced into using all your defensives, giving them an opportunity to just press 1 a couple more times for 6k each.
---
Balance patch is near. People hating mesmers and mirage mains in comments have been activated.
---
I played warrior for my first character and it always felt bad to me. Then I made a holosmith and holy shit *that's* how warrior should feel. On holo the hits feel fast and strong, you can block when you need to, and it gives the good feeling of rushing in and fucking shit up
---
ignoring the fact that they could've announced it remotely over the internet from home.
---
the guy streaming on twitch did say that he walked to work cause his car was blocked in while others probably live too far to walk.
---
How depressing
---
In dragon genetics, the gene for color, C, is purple-dominant (CC) and yellow-recessive (cc). The purple gene is also only partially dominant, so Cc results in a blue color.
---
Kralk is CC, mommy kralk (who we haven't seen yet) is cc; Glint Cc, and her dragon boyfriend was also Cc, and so we get Aurene (Cc) and Vlast (cc).
---
You can double-cast them a few different ways. The healing signet resets all the timers for phantasms, so you cast three, hit the signet, cast three more, weapon swap and cast the last one, with continuum shift I think you can probably get about ten out. 
---
Rampage is overtuned imo, but compared to all the other bullshit in pvp it doesn't look to bad...
---
Lol by 1 week. Cant they do it in 2-3 days. Announce the thing and activate it later when you can. This is bs. People can work from home to make announcement post.
---
But we already know what they're working on. Are people really so insecure that they just need Anet to come along every couple of weeks and say "yep, still working on it!"
---
Istan - Paladawan is every two hours at XX:45. GH is triggered by clearing mordant forces from the map so you can force it. Akili and books are regular events. There are lots of events in Istan, but those are the usual ones because they're near waypoints. 
---
Silverwastes: You pretty much rotate round the four bases then take down some bosses, queue up for the three lanes at the end to protect allies as they remove barriers and then go for bosses. There's more to it than that, but join a squad and follow the leader. 
---
Heart of Thorns are all timed quite strictly, but all very achievable. I think the Verdant Brink one is the messiest, so if you do that first then know that the rest are more organised. Auric Basin is very farmable.
---
Not having the expansions would be like only downloading half the game......
---
(Thread necromancy because I've been listening to the HoT soundtrack a lot lately)
---
*Scar* and *Mouth of Mordremoth* are two of my absolute favorite pieces of combat music in that expac, so while you might hate doing it, you're still SUPER good at it.
---
I think the only chance we'll get to heal kralkatorrik's voice is if we do some mumbojumbo in the mists that lets us hear his thoughts (like with snaff's mind control headband he used briefly before his death).
---
For Glint and Vlast we've only ever heard their scattered voice recordings in GW2. Though Glint, Albax and Kunavang talked directly to the player in GW1, Crystal and Saltspray dragons are definitely able to speak.
---
Aurene spoke through Caithe for those 4 words in All or Nothing- which sounded to me like 2 voices talking at once but blended together. 
---
I expect all dragons have the capacity of speech in some form. Whether or not they would even consider conversing with the young races of tyria though, depends on the dragon. 
---
I think i've talked myself into a circle ORZ
---
The current instas are not annoying. I like then (except SS). They make stuff harder for people that don't know how stuff works.
---
This is reflected by fractal stuff rising in price  meaning supply dropped, meaning more people cant complete fractals... All these people stopped running certain instab combos / fractals because they are "annoyed" they can't finish them.
---
Or maybe swapping 2 ultities is "too annoying" and they stopped doing fractals. I sincerely think these people belong in SW / istan.
---
Btw i couldnt finish 100cm with slippery slope last night. It was hard (because we quit) not annoying (that would mean we did it and just took more time)
---
A set of t4s is usually 35-40 mins. Some times you spend 10-20 min more. It's not a big deal. Get over it.
---
I'm going to baby my laptop to keep it going for another 3-5 years.  GW2 works well, so there's no reason to upgrade.  Plus, I have some legacy programs that won't work on Win 10, but are still useful to me.
---
Even when updates stop, gonna keep at it.  I sandbox everytime I'm online, so that'll help keep me sort of safe.
---
If GW3 comes out, and the specs require a new computer, I'll just leave the game and give my character name to someone.
---
I am not talking about the comment itself. I am talking about the fact that the "announcement" for the announcement was just an off-hand comment on a stream. The announcement itself would obviously be more than that. Which is probably also why it got delayed due to the snow. 
---
Outside of fractals chronos hit 40-60% boon duration to hit permanent uptimes on boons, with the assumption that another chrono will be extending their own boons with 10 man SOI.
---
Inside fractals, chronos take 100 boon duration to ensure permanent uptimes. 
---
You are just another guy who mistakes difficulty with annoyance.
---
Maybe if you made a point instead of flaming we could have a dialogue.
---
Are we finally getting merged servers?
---
&gt; Like I said from the start, by using "I think", specifically for chosen speech, that denotes pure subjectivity for everything that comes before it.
---
Using a random "I think" in a random sentence doesn't make your whole conversation subjective. It makes your sentence subjective, especially if that one sentence doesn't affect anything else. And it doesn't. 
---
Read the other comment I wrote, it explains your fault. 
---
&gt;Who's freedom am I disregarding? Everyone is free to write whatever pleases them, even non-sensual drivel.
---
Is that so? I mean **I** know that, but do you? 
---
Since earlier you wrote:
---
&gt;Why are you even here in the subreddit anymore?[...] Go elsewhere [...]
---
Hmm.. interesting "everyone is free to write whatever pleases them", and yet you demand that I leave the GW2 subreddit because you don't like what I wrote. 
---
You have a very special idea of "freedom" don't you? ;)
---
You mean 6th anniversary interview? He was bragging about how living world is second coming of christ but nothing about other projects. I do not think he can even mention anything outside of gw2 as he is game director for this game only.
---
The question still remains if the collection precs can be crafted again or not. I don't think anyone has bothered trying again since you have to do a lot to get up to that point and that message about it already being crafted is still there. The non collection ones had that message and had it removed. I was just wondering if Anet removed the restriction on the collection ones but just didn't remove the text from the crafting window.
---
not the same kind of game
---
Like, yeah charr need more depth to their culture, the blood legion homelands needs to be shown as human, asura and norn had a lore prominence in GW1 and they were the main enemy. We already got a ton of sylvari lore with HoT, and an additional tidbit from the recent living world release.
---
All I want to know regarding places and things from GW1 is what happened to them. It's been a few 100 some years, things change. 
---
While we all think the world map right now is really big, [the world is kinda bigger than that](https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc5dd249e31559506e604105e6aa9f03/tumblr_inline_pmvo8lDcSO1rhhgso_500.jpg)
---
My bet is on either lake doric or sandswept isles. More the latter, I'm only there to buy stuff for avocado smoothies.
---
Perfect, I'll check the timers for the best time to hit up Istan. I'm assuming the very first instance up after daily reset is packed, and then just dead for every time after?
---
Play pvp ranked/unranked and wvw. Farm reward track that gives stat selectable armor/weapons. Select viper on them. You will also get good amount of gold from pvp. It takes a 10-15 days to get all gear and choice of weapons if you play everyday for a new player as usually they are only able to get 1 gear piece in a day or two.
---
You disgust me you filthy casual.
---
The reason is simple, I'd say: 
---
Orr and HoT have a very active, map-dominating meta event structure, whereas many other maps don't - in particular the HoT maps are very different from that approach. The hearts are intended as ports of call, while completing them, the more spread-out and unobtrusive events should slowly pop up in the general area, and can be done. 
---
undead: bone horrors raise from killes foes
---
Oh, but you're shattering in there somewhere then.
---
I read that as you fielding seven phantasms *at once*, and my mind couldn't decide whether it was doubting or blown that I'd somehow missed such a game changing ability.
---
"New to GW2, former WoW player, is teh gaeme gud ?"
---
If anything, it is zerk clownbeast that can be locked down, not thief. Thief is far, far more dangerous than this and works not only against istan campflippers.
---
Tho soulbeast has it's own OP roaming build too. Just not this one.
---
Paladawan and Great Hall are meta events, the other two are regular events and if you have a large group champs will spawn.
---
Horses; the unicorns of Tyria.
---
That happens through the maps I mentioned:). Detailed models are made and then baked onto the uv-mapped simplified model, which is the one you can export. Honestly, it's a bit difficult to explain, but try imagining it like a chocolate santa clause. The wrapper is like the maps I mentioned and wraps around the edible part/the low quality model. This way it looks like there are a lot of details; arms, legs, etc, but they are not really there. This is of course veeery simplified
---
That map resonates with me.
---
Haha awesome 
---
Thief literally gets an option to apply all boons i game with plasma. Wtf you on about. Necro 2 stars on boons?
---
I wish this were true, but you’re fooling yourself if you really believe this, OP. 
---
is there dimishing returns on the dragons stand meta event? 
---
ah i see. thanks!
---
I remember getting a legendary precursor on the train, it was 10 days after I had gotten my first legendary precursor in a random Ascalonian Catacomb chest right after you gather all the scepter parts and had to go through the tunnels of CC death. Good times, bought my Dawn precursor right away thanks to a guildy lending me the gold to post said precursors on the TP cuz at the time I was too broke for even that.
---
Guyz, it's not Open Source.
---
Burn the witch.
---
Allegedly a mount, LS5, Alliances, whatever next week's WvW announcement will be, Swiss-style tournaments in PvP, a new 2v2 map, revisions to Spirit Watch, expansion-scale features to be released alongisde LS5 when they're ready.
---
Of course there is another fractal and there's no reason to assume W7 will be the last raid wing - see "Are people really so insecure that they just need Anet to come along every couple of weeks and say "yep, still working on it!""
---
There have already been some small adjustments to instabilities, so yes they're looking at them. 
---
The next expansion (if there is one) would probably be two years away, so of course they're not going to be talking about it now.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
So, we know WvW work is focussed on the alliance system, and we got a small update on that recently. There is a list of incoming PvP updates that anyone can go and look at. And PvE content consists of Living World and Fractals/raids, all of which are getting regular releases so a roadmap isn't required for those features.
---
I agree that Charr deserve some major exposition, but I wouldn't leave Norn out of the equation, just because they were in GW1. The Norn race in GW2 has been severely neglected and weakly represented to the point where many of them just feel like goofy, ever-happy-because-braindead drunkards that just want to kill everything and take it home. I would both love a Norn- and a Charr-centric expansion, and if they somehow pull of both by giving each race three maps in the next expac, I will be praising them highly. 
---
Haha.. hmmm...
---
Yeah, no... if we talk about pvp in current state I'm not even touching GW2 pvp. 
---
He could have easily autoattacked his way through that.
---
Blood Legion Homelands and the Isles and Janthir.
---
As a Necro, being carried by an Elite Form is a personal nightmare of mine.
---
I just found it funny and said, why not? :)
---
Yes, because we all know how great this community is when it comes to understanding plans, right? 
---
So, the answer is that you ARE so insecure that you need to be constantly reassured?
---
The raid and fractal team were merged because they shared expertise, the size of the teams were not reduced. As this was purely an internal logistic issue there's no reason that this would merit an update.
---
As such we have been *given* no reason to think development would have ceased, especially as the last three releases have brought one or the other.
---
funny you even consider yourself a "player" of the game
---
&gt; Btw i couldnt finish 100cm with slippery slope last night. It was hard (because we quit) not annoying (that would mean we did it and just took more time)
---
Have you tried with 3 healers?
---
Spotted the delusional Anet shill.
---
As a thief, mesmer still wins the 1v1 more often than not. Even with consume plasma, it’s just too overwhelming. It was different when thief had double steal, that was when thief was a true hard counter to mesmer. But that only lasted for about 4 months.
---
The fact all we get is useless art streams and developers trying to "play" wvw makes me belive it's a case of incompetence. Feels like they went bananas on story telling and 10% on gemstore. Days of proper dev comms are over (when profession developers went on stream and spoke about class changes, where they want to go etc.)
---
Now its just a SJW shitshow. 
---
Going back to GW1: Eye of the North, they were portrayed very differently. More stoic, attuned to nature, devastatingly powerful, and transformed whenever they saw a need for it. They still had parties, but it wasn't nearly as all-encompassing in their culture as it is in GW2.
---
So a lot of the desire for more norn content is to give them some semblance of their old identity back.
---
Shit, I have a human female thief :(
---
Amen. 
---
Ok, but the fsct that a 3% health mesmer has so many immune cycles that its one supposed counter has to bait shit out to finish a kill is the problem. I play mesmer and thief, and you can climb through plat just spamming skills. Chronobunker is insane. Mirage is insane. Chronobunker is less cancer due to being power and therefore less obnoxious, but still extremely overtuned.
---
Who did you do them with :^) 
---
This has been brought up a few times already; the problem with this theory is Caithe's comment after Aurene's "death." Anet placed a lot of emphasis on Caithe's "branding" from Aurene. You can see the effects of the branding leave Caithe, and Caithe herself states that she can't feel Aurene's magic anymore. 
---
Not to say that it's impossible (there's a lot of avenues they could take if they want to have Aurene revive), but I do think this is the less likely route that they take unless they're fine with intentional take-backs on dialogue.
---
Real life grind for gear and expensive food modifiers. 
---
Why is that? 
---
I'm new to the game and am currently playing a Reaper, and frankly that spec alone brought me to play this game where I had no interest previously and I'm having a ball.
---
30 minutes LFG and 20 minutes speedclear haha
---
What specific classes? I took a *typical* fractal group that doesn't change their builds.  Oh no, don't even get me start on the most anti-projectile effecient team, that could possibly beat this fractal. 
---
"You as a heal tempest" can take aura share and just rotate through air focus 4 (6/30), sand squall (4/30), aftershock (4/35), earth overload (4/20) resulting in a totally foolproof 70% reflect uptime for a group. You. A-lo-ne. Not counting any procs. Not even touching a firebrand/guardian, which is itself an anti-projectile powerhouse and was used for this purpose way, way before PoF and HoT.  And not even saying that all these skills don't have to be spammed, but often be timed in an obvious telegraph that this instability gives seconds before proccing. 
---
It isn't about classes. It is about people being mediocre. And I'm saying "mediocre" as something a lot of complaining players really should strive to achieve first.
---
The lack of communication is deliberate. The hype train caused too many problems so Anet’s stance is now officially “we’ll talk after it ships.”
---
Some of those open ended answers... not to call anyone out but 
---
&gt;Siren's Landing. Wasn't Orr meant to be cleansed since we killed Zhaitan? Why does it look so ugly there?
---
did you even play the map my dude, there's a subnarrative involving the sylvari there who talk extensively about the massive project that is cleansing orr.
---
&gt;Teleport does not work everywhere and can be countered by using damage on yourself.
---
The whole point of this discussion is surprise burst attacks.  That's what happened to OP.
---
&gt;Ranger damage comes from more than 1500range while their pets keeps you in combat and you waste your stunbreak on pet cc or first cc from lb and eventually you are out of dodges and you eat the rapid shot+sic'em and die instantly.
---
Close the gap and the longbow auto attack damage is pitiful.  Break line of sight and they can't do damage.  If it's a soulbeast, which it will be if it's doing this much damage, the pet is fused with them and won't be going after you.  If they drop the fusion to try to get the pet to push you out of cover, that's a good time to rush them down and punch them to death especially if they wasted their unblockable signet on initial burst.
---
&gt;There is no running from ranger who camp on high spots/distance and free casts while not endangering himself. 
---
And that's true for any class with long ranged options that stand on high ground or walls.  Deadeye can do the same thing kneeling on a wall in WvW for instance.
---
&gt;Btw ranger has very very high disengage potential too so good luck trying to catch him even if you manage to survive the combo. 
---
They have about as much mobility as a warrior if they're using sword.  Up to two backwards dodge skills and a leap.  That's it.  If you can't catch that, don't chase.
---
I assume to make anet a monthly extra profit so they get either more drive to create meaningfull content or to farm people off for some more cash.
---
Repeatable hearts are a major component of gathering map-specific resources like mistonium/berries/logs/pearls, etc...
---
That's a terrible idea.
---
If you can't kill a thief you're bad just kinda hands down. Thief can't 1v1 anything reliably. It may be hard to catch one of they're trying to run but if they stop to fight 1v1 it's laughably easy. 
---
Raids are definitely not terrible in ffxiv. They are much bettey with different difficulty levels. Meta is important in any competitive environment. I agree regarding the combat. It's terrible till lvl 50. I'm playing RDM and it gets alot better at later levels. 
---
The traditional warrior mentality. The moment their class is slightly outside the meta they'll start crying about how their class is unplayable.
---
Whoops. When I said that, I meant Canach's gambling partner. I realize that wasn't very clear though.
---
Thought of the exact same thing when I read that. They better fucking not. 
---
Oh god I laughed way harder at this than I should have at work. Thank you, reddit. 
---
Honestly, I kinda' think that would be fun if they were either (a) are the explodey ones that don't do too much damage, or (b) have a bit more health to them and need to be killed, but you can rally off them. 
---
Pretty sure I did this. 
---
Buy it yourself. According to gw2eff crafting an ascended weapon costs around 50g and fractals give you ~20g every day. My main source of the income in this game are daily fractal runs and I'm not poor somehow.
---
Actually you don't have to, since mai has lower AR requirements than 100. You could have just take a green focus from your lootbag and run with it for the fractal. You just needed to think about your situation for a single moment. Dagger, hovewer, is pretty much a must have.
---
Not a personal attack bub, if you play the game to its fullest extent and see the shortcomings with its zero progress model no matter what content you will see why wow in it's current state is a better game in every aspect. And I mean every aspect. I was a hardcore fan boi at first, I used to be all about that gw2 front page and is why I was subbed here, sorry you dont control my sub button. I am entitled to my opinion and you yours, enjoy wasting your time on this game. It's not a troll if I really feel that way and I am willing to eat the downvotes to say so. Apparently some of the other commenters agree with me and were not downvoted at all compared to be because they were late to the party. They built an mmo that cant handle being an mmo, the engine cannot even perform correctly in massive battles... their solution to this is removing character models to improve performance. Fuck it, Google it yourself, there is no short list to the amount of problems this game has. It's good for a playthrough single player, this is by no means a good mmo.
---
I really hope you're being sarcastic 
---
I have a Google document for the races in 5e sorta based on previous homebrew stuff I found before. I was planning on running a campaign at some point. The races are stronger than your typical 5e though, and I'm not sure I'm satisfied with them yet, but I haven't had more time to spend on them. I'll clean up the document and link it when I get home. 
---
Have a night of 1v1s with ROM, and have coms on stream... GW2 needs more of this between top pvp streamers \o/
---
How much does it cost for 100gold? (irl money) just curious. 
---
tl;dr: You don't play the game, but your life is empty so you go online and whine about the game.
---
Thanks :) I was planning to, but im the rare specimen of having more time on weekdays. :D
---
I dislike Lich form, that's why. 
---
&gt;puglife is a crap shoot.
---
You just have to join/create groups with at least 150-250+ kp requirements. Or make your way up there, if you don't have it yourself. People might not be stellar, but  are decently competent there, t4+cms run really never takes over an hour. Just don't drop your standarts and avoid no/low reauirement groups, because decent people usually avoid them too.
---
This is simply not true, thief can reset pretty much any fight and wear down most of the builds by just repeating the same opener, both on dagger or rifle. It may not win that easily if you play a decent build and are aware of it, but to actually *lose* it has to fuck up royally. 
---
And it will surely kill anything that dies to pewpew soulbeast. 
---
I would love a bard/minstrel spec with music as a theme. Kinda like a siren. A weapon like shortbow would fit and songs/shouts as utilities and f skills like firebrand with different instruments (guitar, flute).
---
&gt;The only way mirage will be less OP is by reworking MC in PvP. 
---
lol
---
So I'm a bit late to the party, but the reason people are saying that season 5 will immediately follow season 4 is because of [this video.](https://youtu.be/WM-pKVHvfUo) Specifically near the 3:35 mark.
---
What happens after season 5? Your guess is as good as ours. Hopefully another expansion, but as far as I know we have no official information on that.
---
Strangely enough, I'm not really bothered by SS on 100CM. Bosses doesnt move, so you are in most case. I mean, you can avoid mecanics on your with special action, rest is just DPS. 
---
Always kinda wanted an attunement system for Dhuum, where you each pick one of the reapers to have to do the greens for. 7 people on greens, kiter, tank, healer. everyone does something at some point.
---
No he wasn't, he was moved from CMs to working on raids. 
---
Again, because apparently you aren't getting this - Fractals and raids and LS are all in continual development (this has been stated a billion times). Therefore until they tell us something has changed (or we stop getting them) we must assume that they are still being made.
---
We are terribly sorry that high end content requires gear, some understanding and ability to adapt to your situation.
---
Hey, this would be greatly appreciated! As I've said elsewhere, I probably won't be getting to the conversions first, focusing on the setting aspects first and foremost. However, any content out there will be useful for a future time for either me, or someone better who decides to take up the mantle. Thanks!
---
I personally think if they just increased the cd on all the skills it would be fine
---
If that is true it's so sad. Anet used to crank out so much content in the GW1 days with such a small team. Now I think anet is what like ~400 employees and they barely get anything done. Like what do they do at work all day? Read forum posts about how quaggans are the best?
---
Lady Wisteria isn't the one who died.
---
Lack of on-demand content: you need shit to do even when no events are taking place. And the heart grind (similar to ascended, aka power grind, being the answer to a lacking progression), is simply the easiest way to do that.
---

Starting your journey to take down the Elder Dragons, huh? But due to our new rules the questions must be left in the [&gt;questioning session&lt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/search?q=title%3Aquestions+thread+author%3AAutoModerator&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week). We have plenty of experienced historians there that can guide you on your first steps.

If you think your thread should be allowed to stay or if this was a mistake do report this comment or send a modmail and Pact commander will come take a look.
---
If we use [Cosmic Power](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Cosmic_Power) as a basis, as well as pre-Taimi's-Season-3-retcon like Thaumanova Fractal and Sorrow's Embrace story, then there'd be three overarching types of magic: ley, draconic, and Mists (though I'm confused why Exalted is labeled as ley in this, as their magic stems from the Forgotten who come from the Mists). Divine/god magic could be a potential fourth, though since the Jade Wind counts as Mists magic per Cosmic Power, I'm doubtful (as the Jade Wind was caused by a blessing of Dwayna twisted by Shiro).
---
Everything that falls under "Mists magic" (and Exalted) and divine magic have shown to be counteractive or immune to dragon corruption (so long as that dragon did not eat Mists magic). Foefire seems to burn dragon corruption more fiercely, while the ghosts show immunity to corruption; divine fire (from the Forgotten) burns and fears mordrem more fiercely; Kormir's protection around Sun's Refuge keeps the branded out, even riftstalkers; Balthazar, a being of pure magic, literally walked through a horde of destroyers and faced Primordus head-first before he could even activate the device (he had to build three barriers, all during the time the Commander chased the druid elders); Forgotten magic (and by extension, Exalted) are immune to corruption; Abaddon's remnant magic in sands is immune to corruption until Kralkatorrik ate Balthazar...
---
We see multiple corrupted djinn in The Crystal Dragon instance, no indication that they were fire djinn. Plus, Kralkatorrik shows no benefit towards fire anywhere after Path of Fire's events, nor does Aurene. Both only show dimension hoping abilities.
---
We also see nothing of Primordus or Jormag, or the Maguuma Bloodstone, in either Balthazar, Aurene, or Kralkatorrik.
---
This suggests that Balthazar "changed" the magic he absorbed into his own personal "flavor" of magic. Much like the Elder Dragons do when they eat your random person or artifact. So while Balthazar was empowered by Jormag, Primordus, and the Maguuma Bloodstone, he never used "their magic" for the same reason you don't see Primordus using crystal magic despite Kralkatorrik having slept for 200 years while Primordus was awake - dragons (and possibly gods) only seem new forms of magic when the dragon / (former) god loses control of their domain.
---
Should be noted that Balthazar was no longer the god of war at the time of his death, having been stripped of his divinity between the games. But like Dhuum, it seems that former gods remain "connected" to their domain/flavor of magic, thus turns any new magic they absorb to that domain's magic like Elder Dragons do, and their death (with sufficient magic behind it?) would give an Elder Dragon those powers too.
---
I'd also note that secondary domains like ice and water are interchanged among gods. Dhuum has no ties to ice while Kormir none to water and Abaddon had no ties to spirit or order like Kormir does. Thus, if Kralkatorrik / Aurene got any magic from Balthazar that was more than "generic Mists-hoping abilities" then it would be *War Magic* not fire.... Good luck defining that.
---
Rampage is really strong, the rest of warrior's kit is kinda weak (depends on specialization).
---
"Everyone can do everything with anything in this game, just have fun!" - The playerbase, when this player asked which build to use.
---
The poll options are way too messy, with lot of holes and redudance. Kind of a mess if you ask me, but there you go.
---
Also, Stone Dwarves have consistently made it to the 3rd place in most playable race polls (tengu 1st and largos 2nd), so it's kinda weird to not see them as an individual option anywhere in the race question. The context of the question isn't clear, but it's obvious people will vote from a playable race perspective.
---
The optimist in me is seeing expansion 3 in the works.
---
The pessimist in me is seeing mobile gaming ruining the gaming industry and anet is hopping aboard to make a mobile game.
---
I'm fairly certain the latter is what winds up happening. 
---
People have been complaining about mesmer since the dawn of time. 
---
Mirage is fine. Just run massive condie clear or get gud, and you will beat it every time.

Add one more level to Divinity Reach

They stated the selection of legendaries that would be included with HoT, which were. They stated that the rest of the set would arrive later, which they now (almost) have.

my experience over the course of ~400 or so runs (which isn't as much as some people, but still enough to comment i think) has not really shown a correlation between high kp pings and improved performance
---
An overwhelming majority of the time I join a 100+ kp ping group, it doesn't go all that well. there are times it goes okay, there are times it goes great, but I end up running into problems (people messing up mechanics, people becoming personified toxic trails to deflect their mistakes) more often than not.
---
surprisingly the 30-50kp groups seem to do a lot better on average. maybe it's because they're either newer/more engaged with the gameplay or they have more to prove or whatever, but they've been a way more reliable average for me.
---
the best groups I've run with didn't even bother to ask for pings. sometimes it's because we all happen to have run with each other (individually) at some point in the past, sometimes it's just because they're experienced and just casually running through.
---
asking for kp can kind of help via intimidation factor of "I can't join because I don't have enough experience", but it sometimes feels like an excuse to just get carried because they've run it so many times before. i'm not for/against high kp demands, and I get the general practice is to get more experienced players, but ultimately:
---
it's a crap shoot. you can't control the people you play with or who are available when you're pugging. you have to work with what you've got. if you can play around daily reset, you have a wider pool to work with than someone who gets off of work 4 hours after reset.
---
Oh phew 😅 
---
Yeah People still do champ and event trains on the map whenever the rewards rotate to powerful blood, charged lodestones, giant eyes, ect since they're all on the same week and its good for getting a ton of the materials quickly without blowing a bunch of gold on them. 
---
They actually specifically said it wasn't about alliances.
---
When you check the heart vendor buy list, you buy a small bundle of the map currency with karma. 
---
If they weren't repeatable, it would be basically nearly-free map currency from every vendor for every character, once a day... You think that's a good idea?
---
I didn't say it was.
---
Well, if you refuse to improve your situation yourself, I don't know how to help you with your 1.5hr clears and people not doing the most basic tasks.
---
My "Arkk" log folder has 718 files (some of them are ~30kb ones from cd reset, but some are missing due to me not updating arc), a lot of them are done with pugs, and all I can say is that kp is quite a reliable and, pretty much, the only possible way to control the quality of people you get. It is nothing about "intimidation", it is about pure experience and stable perfomance. No one is going to be able to leech literal hundreds of kills without getiing into everyone's blocklist, and even if they tried, they would actually learn something from pure repetition. 
---
Things like druids not maintaining might or people doing 2k dps just don't happen there, and even if they did, that would be an instant /votekick with a bonus of not being allowed in for a next time.
---
If you want to improve your time in the game, you should put aside whatever ideological barriers you have. And yes, I've pugged at ~6 am server time too. You can still get a 250+ group there and it will still perform fine.
---
\*looks at the image\*
---
...
---
WHAT?!
---
I feel like a european that just discovered that N/Z america, asia and afrika exist. Oh, and Russia I suppose.
---
Thief can't outrun anything is they choose to fight. If shadowstep is used one time and they don't reset then that's gg. Not to mention thief can't outrun all classes anyway. At least my holosmith lol. Thief can't reset versus other mobile classes unless they have all cooldowns. Factor in reveals and thief is a a non factor. Can't even remember the last time I viewed thief a threat in wvw lol. 
---
"Dream realm" raid where your squad chose one of previous raid bosses to be on your side vs main baddie. Bossfight arena changes under influence of your ally. 
---
Not satisfied with the options. Answers I \*would\* give if I could:
---
*What's your favorite region?* Indifferent
---
*How satisfied are you with our current coverage of Kryta?* It's as fleshed out as it needs, even if the fleshing out was a failure (looking at you Season 3).
---
*How interested are you in exploring the Woodland Cascades and the Isles of Janthir?* Woodland Cascades: GIMME. Janthir: Mursaat are dead, what's the point. Ship has sailed.
---
*Do you feel like human lore is the most worthwhile in GW2?* It got butchered almost from beginning to end...
---
*Which non-playable races (their lore, specifically) are most interesting to you?* Why not something brand new from distant lands?
---
How would you tell the difference between developers shifted to work on another expansion vs shifted to work on another game?
---
I can't say that the time since PoF released feels that different content-wise compared to the time after HoT (when LS3 was releasing and PoF was in development) or the time before HoT (when LS2 was releasing and HoT was in development).
---
What makes you so sure they aren't working on another expansion?
---
Good luck with that, I guess.
---
Yeahhh plant friends!
---
word
---
I could see them waiting for the end of this season for a big announcement to avoid spoilers. Here's hoping!
---
Oh god, yes!
---
I just wish they would do a major pass on all of it. Damage is crazy high overall and I think the defenses are way too much too. The insane amounts of invulns, evades and blocks are necessary, though, to counter the crazy amounts of damage. They really need to reduce the overall power level, offensive and defensive, across the board. I think people would probably rage hard if they did though!
---
Oh my apologies, a combination of another comment and downvotes made me misinterpret. No hard feelings 
---
Anything but rev or thief.
---
There's actually a dungeon with a Sharknado phase in wow haha. I would love to see it in gw2
---
Okay OP I have a question. What percentage of the playerbase do you think raids? Or plays T4 Fractals. Do you think this is some sort of majority.  Hint, we got our first raid after the game had been out for 3.5 years.
---
This game wasn't sold or introduced as a raiding game and at least part of the playerbase is not interested in raids, or even challenging instanced content.
---
When HoT came out (which I loved btw), we saw how much of the playerbase wanted that harder content and how much of the playerbase felt like the game was destroyed by it. HoT was not well received at first for an number of reasons, two of which were complexity of the new zones and difficulty of the new zones. 
---
The people who raid weren't the guys complaining about that. It was the casual playerbase, which unfortunately was also by that point the bulk of the playerbase. 
---
I mean I remember Anet nerfing Orr due to complaints. I remember Anet nerfing HoT due to complaints. There isn't just one playerbase looking for one type of experience. There's many many factions of people who are all looking for different experiences.
---
While you're looking for raid and dungeon info I can assure you the bulk of the playerbase probably isn't (even though a good percentage of reddit probably is and I'm sure I'll probably be downvoted).
---
Do I believe Anet should communicate more? Oh hell yeah. I've said it on numerous occasions. Most importantly we should know if an expansion is at least in the works. 
---
My best guess is that the company is one that changes plans quite a bit and they can't afford to say crap because they don't stick their plans internally. Makes for some interesting game moments, but also adds a lot to uncertainty making the entire playerbase less secure. I don't think it's a good trade off.
---
But even when Anet says that everything is subject to change and we change things all the time (they used iterate in virtually every dev comment for years and even had an article on their website just about iteration), once they say something it's locked in the community's collective memory and that's it. If they don't do it it's a lie. I've seen it before.
---
I think part of this is Anet's fault. Naturally if we're more starved for information, we're going to hang onto every single word Anet says. But yeah, I think the way the company works internally makes announcements over all more risky. I think they try and scrap stuff more than most companies. It makes for a more creative game, but it also makes for more wasted time and effort. Is that a good trade off?  I have no idea.
---
Okay I'm rambling now. I get that it's frustrating, but that doesn't mean that this company works like others, which is why they produced a game significantly different from most out there.
---
it's not fine but it's not beyond broken like scrubs like to think either.
---
I can sympathize with that to an extent. I have cultures that I write which I'm not entirely comfortable with. It aint easy, and there's definitely times that I'll delve into a cultural conflict which leads me to places that aren't very fun or thought provoking. Then I tend to scrap it and rewrite it, either dodging the conflict or finding a reason why it would be permissible in that specific circumstance. 
---
But I do think you're right. It is cheap for Rytlock to regret all of that. It gives the impression of taking a unique cultural identity and diminishing it because it isn't ours - less Rytlock's voice and more the writer speaking through him. What swayed him to that conclusion? Was it the debacle with Rox? How did his values begin to align with our modern cultural values, which are by and large thoroughly anglo-protestant, and are far from the historical norm? We're an absurd outlier in history, with our egalitarian notions, strong individualism, belief in inclusivity, and belief in things like human rights. The fierce collectivism of the Charr seems constrictive and unappealing to us. But there's no doubt they'd find our way of life chaotic and isolated. Listen to anybody from a culture with large families that live together describe the nuclear family. I've heard it called a form of abuse, forcing careers, domestic chores, *and* the raising of children upon two people. But many of us may find a large multigenerational household to be stifling. We want our privacy, or to be in charge of our own time.
---
What I'm trying to get at is that it's far more reasonable to expect cultural differences, some or even many of which we may disagree with or find unpalatable. But those are important because they create narrative tension, conflict, and they're interesting to explore. When every society just becomes a more idyllic clone of our own, or just a regular clone of our own, it feels boring and contrived.
---
thank you!
---
&gt;I live in one of the northernmost ass in the world
---
Umm...
---
You _do_ have to be careful, though. While a perfect spindown in a proper random situation is fair, the arrangement of the numbers makes even a _slight_ imbalance cause a significant trend in the average result.
---
A few discussion threads [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1hr8a9/does_using_a_spindown_dice_matter/), [here](https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/7507/does-it-really-matter-if-dice-are-randomized), and [here](https://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/magic-fundamentals/magic-rulings/magic-rulings-archives/264991-the-official-spindowns-are-they-random-question) are largely in agreement that a spindown is _probably_ fine, but there are legitimate risks to relying on a spindown d20 for generating random numbers, and there's a chance of skilled throwers being able to manipulate spindown dice far more easily than regular d20s.
---
“Must have rank 2000” .. lol ok fuck me then 
---
*Build Templates*
---
Or put global cooldown on ambush skills (or at least on each ambush individually). 
---
&gt; How would you tell the difference between developers shifted to work on another expansion vs shifted to work on another game?
---
Easy, they said no expansion for next few years. Imo they don't want to make any at all just testing if it's gonna work this time, so they didn't give definite answer.

The last time they communicated reddit managed to get 2 devs fired, don't bet on anything other than fluff from them at this point. I do think a third and final expansion is on the way, and it will most likely be also focused on 1 single gem store exploitable thing like the mounts and gliders. Maybe they'll even use the wvw remake as the big selling point :p 
---
There is - in new content. Anet doesn't improve old content because that would make sense.
---
I've heard people say that bunny ears are the epitome of generic "human female meta". My min-size Asuran Daredevil begs to differ, as those bunny ears fit perfectly with her bouncing twice her height into the air to smack you over the head.
---
The problem is they sold us HoT with the promise of legendaries, then suspended production on them months after we bought it. 3 years on the set still hasnt been completed. That gs and the raid ring will be the last legendaries this game will get.
---
Most pugs will still ask for druid/chrono. But the firebrand/renegade combo are starting to see more play since they got buffed.
---
refuse to improve my situation? I've tried joining all ranges of kp reqs to see what's up. not sure what you expect out of "improving my situation" when it comes to pugging beyond just finding a static
---
it's not a matter of "leeching" — sometimes you have people who played dps for 500 runs just now learning how to BS and their DPS isn't great or they whiff on beach balls / breaking anoms. sometimes they have an off day.
---
also to clarify: I don't mean a dps doing like less than 10% of benchmark - I mean in a fight where you would reasonably expect 16k (like 50th percentile) they pull 9-11k. not enough to *ruin* a run, but still too low to bypass or push past phases nicely.
---
yeah, I try to join high KP groups because I expect better results from them. all I'm saying is that even in a high kp group it's a crap shoot if things are going to go smoothly or not.
---
Define healthy. 
---
Pvp community is decreasing and lots of pvp players are unsatisfied with slow balance, afk players, bots, win trading etc.
---
Wvw players are quitting the game since "playing for fun" stops being fun when there's no reason to ever put effort into doing anything, when you're doing the same thing over and over and over again for 6+ years and when you're not even rewarded for doing well. 
---
Content and balance patches are very slow, making expansions the only real content in both pvp and wvw (and 2+ years for something new and meaningful isn't very exciting).
---
Raid community is also decreasing since new wings come too slow and majority of bosses are not quite interesting to veterans because they are dps golems with a few unique animations that can easily be skipped/ignored. Ever since wing 3 only the last boss in each wing can be considered challenging, yet people still want easy mode.
---
New players that join these 3 "modes" are usually there for easy rewards, not the challenging/competitive part of those and if they cant get it easy way they play the "I paid for this game I deserve everything" card.
---
Let's be realistic, the only healthy playerbase is in open world pve and fractals.
---
Try axe/axe instead of GS, you might enjoy the feeling of it better, and axe/axe definitely has a role in end game too
---
JUST DO ITTT
---
You make it sound like it's an impossible task. A system that already exists really wouldn't be very difficult to add to old content, I'm not exactly suggesting they spend months reworking the entire story.
---
And again, seeing as you missed it last time, THERE IS MORE THAN ONE TEAM THAT WORKS ON THE GAME.
---
Warrior is nearly always sought after for his banners and buffs. They are easier to spec and gear than a chrono or Druid, plus easier to play. 
---
I appreciate your thoughts, thank you. 
---
People strongly disagreed with me when the story was first posted. The game had a strong focus on the five races at launch, but it was abandoned almost immediately for the three orders, who were themselves abandoned for a monolithic story focused on the Commander's exploits. Which allows us to have regular story content... it's a trade-off I can accept, but we've still lost something special.
---
So to see our first glimpse into Charr culture in ages focused entirely on how Rytlock basically wishes he were a human. Blech.
---
Axe axe is actually higher dps, and brings quickness/fury via its skills.
---
GS is only really good for the mobility for running to or away from fights.
---
If need be you can also drop off hand axe for a shield (for survival) or mace for control (later doesn't even lose much dps)
---
Cant stop the whiteknights.
---
I agree, Warrior GS2 is not a fun ability which drags the GS down a lot (as it is the major damage ability). Definitely recommend *not* following min/max guides for open world, especially when leveling, and instead use weapons that are fun and feel good.
---
Might slow you down a tiny amount, but will accomplish more by being engaged.
---
&gt; Define healthy.
---
Pays their bills.
---
&gt;  I often find myself either missing the skill or cancelling it to early since you cant move and there is only a specific range where it hits which often leads to me slicing randomly in the air while the mob is attacking.
---
This sounds exactly like the sort of thing that would be categorized as learning a build for which there is no substitute. Although I guess you could just do what I do and toss the GS and use axes instead.
---
Make Mirage only have 50 endurance, as a cool opposite to Daredevil having 150. Mirage cloak is powerful enough to make them be careful about dodging. Just give them a bit more Vigor acess if there's issue.
---
This issue is mostly on the user end. Typically it happens during the cinematic sequence because information isn’t being sent so your connection times out. This can sometimes be combatted by pushing keys to fire off skills. You obviously won’t see the skill activate but the information will be sent regardless. It’s not foolproof but I have noticed that I get significantly less disconnection issues when doing so.
---
Okay, now lets ramp that to the scale of ANet, a team of (according to Wikipedia, citing an official piece of material created by ANet) \~400 people. 4 hours isn't very much compared to 3,200.
---
Oh right, and those other teams must be doing literally nothing!
---
Also you clearly have no idea how game development works if you think you can just copy-paste a system from new content into old.
---
They are already so slow I imagine half of their devs do nothing and have enough spare time to fix mistakes of the past :)
---
If fixing some old instances would indeed harm already pathetically slow release schedule, that would mean 2 things:
---
1) they suck as devs
---
2) they suck as a company
---
When i need a d20 i use a d20, and when i need a spin-down counter to count life in Magic i usually use an android app. Or a spin-down counter from Izzet, but phones make it just so much less messy.
---
I was just replying why some d20 are 'weird' even if not 'wrong'. Whenever i roll a d20 spin-down life counter i feel... dirty? improper? out of place?
---
To be fair far from all of those ~400 people are actually programmers. 
---
You do realise I just used 4 hours as an example, right? There's no way to know without asking a dev how much time it would take to implement such a thing.
---
How do you know? Unless you have metrics of all stuffs open you can't really make a statement like that. Different software can handle connection hiccups differently. A MMO tend to be able to handle them quite badly in general, since it requires constant communication with a server.
---
If it was a bug in the software itself, surely it would affect more or less everyone, which doesn't seem to be the case. 
---
&gt;I appreciate your thoughts, thank you. 
---
No, thank you for giving me something to think about!
---
&gt;People strongly disagreed with me when the story was first posted.
---
Rytlock's story, right? Not when the game first launched. Pretty sure you meant the former, but I was a little confused at first and thought you meant the latter.
---
&gt;who were themselves abandoned for a monolithic story focused on the Commander's exploits. Which allows us to have regular story content... it's a trade-off I can accept, but we've still lost something special.
---
I don't know if that trade-off had to be made though.
---
Consider - a lot of MMO narratives focus on the individual player as the ultimate hero, but that's insanely contrived and flies in the face of all experiences beyond instances, right?
---
I think that we could have kept the narrative of the pact, the orders, or the races alive if we were established as members of those organizations rather than a force of nature unto ourselves. It would be much easier to get a sense of culture if you were taking orders from your superiors or talking with your peers. You're immersed in an organization, part of something, rather than being a wholly independent agent. And yeah, the Commander has the gang, but it's not really the same, is it?
---
Not to say it can't be salvaged as it is now. If they used the maps to explore cultural domains as much as they explored regions - for instance, a Charr frontier where there's cultural clashing between independent frontiersmen and the collectivistic legions back home - then we could see lore growth for charr. Or an Island dominated by a vigil/pact outpost, where we can get to see deeper into the state of affairs for that faction, and maybe get some additional lore tidbits from map exploration, background dialogue, and books - like what they did with Joko.
---
The residents of the areas we have explored are mostly minor races or factions. If we actually explored areas that had a presence from one of the major races, or one of the major factions, then I think we could see lorebuilding for things beyond the commander's narrative or for unrelated factions and/or minor races. These factions can be part of the stage for the Commander's actions, and at that point, all that matters is making sure the stage has sufficient detail for us to make inferences the faction's past and present, or outright state them.
---
the game has been out for a long time. maybe you are just in need of a chance of pace? I went to a different game for almost 2 years and came back to GW2 with renewed interest.
---
What's the best thing to do if you're playing PVP and your teammate stops fighting and just starts fucking around in the corner?
---
Personally I enjoy Sword/Axe quite a bit in open world. Warrior was a tough one for me to find a build that felt fun to play.
---
Nah Mario kart 64 is where it’s at
---
This, I dislike greats word on warrior and enjoyed axe/axe or axe/mace much more.
---
 One good thing about most of the content in gw2 is that you can do it with almost anything. Try different weapons and see what strike your fancy.
---
&gt; Yeah whatever, can't fight this god awful subreddit circlejerk anyways,
---
Lol. Comes in to talk about how toxic the community in, responds to someone who was nice and presented a debate against that viewpoint with saltiness and giving up while being super bitter about it.
---
Literally everybody in this thread is being nice and respectful except for you, so you really shouldn't be making these complaints. As the saying goes, if you meet one asshole today you met an asshole. If you meet assholes all day, maybe you're an asshole.
---
&gt; Downvoted for stating my opinion, further proving my point. 
---
No, downvoted for literally being super toxic while complaining about how toxic everyone else has been (when everyone else was reasonable in this thread, besides you)
---
Report them and move on. Getting in an argument doesn’t help and just makes you look bad.
---
I love for 1v1s and 1v2s to help hone my skills for the rest of the game
---
How do I know? Because I use tools to monitor my incoming and outgoing data connections and see 0 fluctuation when the disconnects happen.
---
And, amazingly enough, it's entirely possible for a bug to not affect every player of a game. You're extremely naive if you think otherwise. 
---
Laws of time xD
---
Bad management (including time) is exactly sucking at your job. GW2 is almost 7 years old and content releases are slower, not faster.
---
Hopefully. I was speculating with my friend as far as what the next expac might contain, and we were both of the opinion that they might push into the interior of Tyria - where the Asura and Skritt are from. They love maps with verticality and it hasn't really been touched on at all, even in the most cursory way.
---
I bring that up because we felt that was way more likely than taking a risk on the Unending Ocean. But maybe, if the community is vocal enough, they'll consider giving us some content in the area. An underwater Inquest or Forgotten facility with some Largos lore and other suff.
---
Any recommended build you find for leveling is crap. The set up you are using was intended for speed leveling alts pre mounts, even if you are using a ftp account this build is not really relevant if you don’t know how the game works. 
---
Just use any weapon you like while you level, test them all, you are sacrificing your own fun just to try and be meta. 
---
This seems really inaccurate. No source, did you make this? If so, are these just your opinions?
---
Because there are a lot of things in here that are objectively not correct lol
---
Try longbow and axe/axe. I agree gs is sort of boring to me . Love longbow’s fire attacks and you can build might with it using it well
---
I mean Rytlock's story, yes, sorry.
---
It would certainly be possible. I would love for maps to have more story and personality. And they've done things like that in the past - exploring the tensions between Crystal Desert's factions in LWS4 zones, meeting the Olmakhan, the new Dredge community.
---
But the monolithic style story is a lot easier to write and manage, especially since there are always multiples pieces of content being worked on at once. I understand why they did it. If they went from something more ambitious I think we'd only get new content two or three times a year.
---
The meta comment is very true. It’s a habit I have when starting new games. Thanks for the insight!
---
Gonna try Axe/Axe when I get home! It seems to be more my style. Thanks for the quick answer!
---
It's entirely possible that they don't have a dedicated bugfixing team, and instead have bugfixes performed by devs that developed the content that needs fixing (as they're most familiar with the relevant code). Certain devs give pretty in-depth reports on bugs in content they created, suggesting this may well be the case.
---
Regardless, old missions not having checkpoints is NOT a bug and even if it was it would still pull development time away from *something*.
---
While the existance of a checkpointing system obviously reduces the time it would take, there's no guarantee it would even function with old story missions in its current form. And even if it did, checkpoints are chosen not automatic, so would require someone going through every mission in order to identify, implement and test checkpoints in order to provide a minor QoL improvement in content that only a minority of the current playerbase are even using.
---
How convenient. Also seem quite weird to not see any fluctuation and yet still be disconnected. 
---
I never claimed that it would have to affect every player in a game. I said that it would affect more or less everyone. As in an majority of players. If it affects only a small subset of players, it is surely more likely than not that the issues are in fact on their computers rather than in the application itself? 
---
You also get fury with GS from the burst
---
Your solution to Necromancers is awesome - it's not only lore friendly, but adds fun game mechanics for either setting! I wonder if there's anything hidden away about the actual reasoning, but if not I'd take that for cannon! I do love trying to answer why things are though, because it gives a sort of creative freedom - as long as it canonically fits in.
---
Unfortunately I haven't been able to get super in depth with all the lore yet, but I can finally start this throughout this weekend and Monday. I am more than happy to share my progress with anyone, as it's not like I can make money off the thing anyways. I'll try and share what I get out of this weekend via Google Drive or something, so that way you can have access whenever. 
---
I do have one thing that comes to mind though: GW focuses on humans as the playable race - obviously to allow a bit more choice, I want to allow a few more races where they make sense. This being said, there is a decent amount of variability within the humans that isn't expanded upon much in the other races. In your opinion, would it make sense to simply have the race be human with different backgrounds, or are they different enough to attempt justifying "sub-races" (those from Cantha has slightly different traits to others, etc.)?
---
Falcons of the Mists
---
Really surprised that in this day and age, a digital communique can be delayed due to weather, lol.
---
I'm guessing they are taking the time to refine the message to slow down the hype train, and potential delays to their timeline.
---
At least someone is offering you a nice cup of coffee
---
Even NA, the chances of those uptimes are INCREDIBLY low. We do have the meme like Jil and Nash, but more often we have 50%+ on the LOW side for bad pugs. 
---
That didn't really answer that question.  Maybe my second one.
---
You're interpreting LS5 as a way to avoid making expansions.  I saw it as a way to avoid a content drought like the one between LS2 and HoT, or between HoT and LS3.
---
Given their previous average pace of 2+ years to develop each expansion, and assuming the last episode of LS4 releases some time in April, without LS5 (or something like it) we would be looking at a half-year+ drought.
---
I just don't see enough evidence that says they have significant manpower diverted to work on a separate project instead of a future expansion.
---
And still, it is what we got about Vlast. Actually the only thing we got.
---
&gt; Deissa plateu, while it has some interesting little nodes (butchers block ftw) large stretches of the map feel barren and empty... or full of cows.. so many cows... THE MOOING IT HAUNTS ME
---
nice :D
---
...it's not hard. Update your build and... well yeah just try to play somewhat decent.
---
GW2 Ranked PVP is a fucking dumpster fire full of dead babies
---
they have to keep warm somehow. sometimes theres no houses around and you need to make do with the nearest tauntaun
---
Hey, brah.. don’t be a jerk.
---
I wouldn't have a huge problem with that, personally. But as I understand it, they have two teams working independently on LWS episodes, and a team dedicated to expacs. I think they could output it faster than you believe - especially because I believe what they're already put out this season is proof they can write a main narrative while also slipping lore into the background.
---
I think that the lore they've managed to get in to the last few LWS episodes has been decent. It gave us some good background on the region we were in and the people that lived there. They just need to replicate that success with existing factions. It might not be super thorough, but it's still much better than the absolute nothing we've gotten so far.
---
No, I still like repeatable hearts. I rather ANet improve it by having the map guide not showing hearts you already complete once than having it removed. 
---
It was basically the same in WvW with winds until they nerfed it, then they beat a dead horse by nerfing full counter in WvW because of PvP when there where things already dealing as much or more damage then warrior from 1200 range in WvW "rev cough cough" 
---
Wow yeah, Rampage, which can be easily mitigated by dodging, blocking, or just good old fashioned blind spam, should definitely be toned down, because for 15s at a go it actually makes Spellbreakers dangerous.
---
Meanwhile, you have reapers with back to back permanent quickness shrouds and Chronos with a rotation that is 50% permanent evade / 30% invulnerability / permanent Blind uptime.
---
Like holy shit my dude.
---
This is why Discipline is the preferred specialization in a lot of content. Warrior becomes so much more enjoyable with 5s weapon swap CD, you get to use only the fun stuff and then you can switch to something else and your CDs will be up by the time you switch back. Avoid skill 5 in combat even skill 2 can be skipped in open world if the time's not right for it.

yes t2 sirens reef last boss is on pair with some t4 fractals
---
Yeah. Poll making 101, you can't flavor the questions with your own bias if you want accurate data.
---
Veteran mobs should be trash with a good build. Check out metabattle and find something that seems interesting to you.
---
&gt;is there a setting to reduce the particle effects and fluff?
---
We've been asking for one since release.
---
That first fight against the Chrono. I've not seen such panic Cluster Bombs in a long time.
---
That Chrono did a good job using the rock to LOS - good way to mess up S/D ports. It looks like the Chrono survived and recovered. Quite deserved really.
---
I was once in a very similar position. In my case, it turned out I had a chronic illness that was being heavily exacerbated by the long, hard hours and the constant pressure and stress (I didn't find this out until I had been in terrible pain for literally *years*). The money was amazing and the work itself was something I enjoyed, but the hours left me with no room for anything else, and the work culture itself was horribly toxic. I wanted to keep working (I grew up poor and was terrified to be without money, and had invested 12 years of my life in this job at this point), but the company did everything it could to resist and stonewall my doctor's orders for very simple accomodations along the way. It wasn't until I realized that I was regularly seriously contemplating driving my car off the road into a tree on my way to and from work every day that I finally decided to quit. 
---
It was terrifying, and the first couple of years were very difficult and full of uncertainty. But the reason I replied, actually, is to let you know that it *does* get better.  I'm partially disabled now (which would have happened eventually probably, but probably would not have happened so early if I hadn't destroyed my body the way I did for so long), but I still work some -- doing the same thing, oddly enough, but in a very quiet and supportive environment where there's no pressure to perform beyond what I can handle, and where they're *happy* to accomodate whatever I need. (Funny, part of my reluctance to leave originally had been that I didn't think it would be better anywhere else. I was wrong.) I was finally able to get my condition under control, and start taking care of my mental health as well. I've learned to cook and eat healthy (before, due to my crazy hours and fatigue and pain, I was eating takeout in my car for nearly every meal). I can exercise, carefully, and am losing weight and getting healthier. I can have friends again, because I have time to speak to them again. I walk with a cane now, but I still somehow feel better than I have in over a decade.
---
Point is, you'll get there. I know the future is really uncertain and scary right now, but things will get better, and someday this scary time will be in the past and won't be able to hurt you anymore. You are absolutely worthy of happiness, and you deserve to feel better. I hope the EMT thing works out for you, but even if it doesn't, you'll find something. When you've already hit rock-bottom, there's nowhere to go but up, and you're going to make it.
---
The Sons of Svanir come across as angry little boys. They’re supposed to be terrifying like something out of Warhammer Chaos. That was back in 2012 though. Our next proper encounter they might be more corrupt, I hope.
---
Are we talking about flat earth or a conspiracy? Jesus Christ, you are hopeless. You are just saying "yeah no, you are wrong" with no relevant reasoning to actually prove that. Everyone else besides you up has expressed no misunderstanding to this degree with my points about Mordremoth and GW2. All sentences were understandable. You just fabricated a scenario for your own benefit about debating what a fact vs. opinion is which you are also in the wrong for in terms of definition. If you just move the goalposts and standards of rational debate, it's no longer rational. It's you just speaking gibberish and feigning ignorance of how a structured conversation works. You have no contextual evidence for any of your arguments and are just pissing in the wind.

Is 53 still the best level for opening silverwastes bags?
---
What's your name on game? Could i ask questions in game or perhaps be shown where to buy the gear?
---
Just make sure that we can also take the virus out of the fractal.
---
no surprise
---
i'd like to see something like w4, i love the setting and creepyness of ruined jail with bosses being sabetha-deimos difficulty (yes i'm a casual shitter don't @ me)
---
What purpose does using tonic in wvw serve? 
---
The queen's dungeon. ( ͡⚆ل͜ ͡⚆)
---
The problem is that you're trying to treat being challenged to use all your options available to the class as a "gate". Old social awkwardness punished gameplay pattern that was incentivised since vanilla dungeons. Current just makes it impossible, which is better because you can't make life harder for yourself just because "you forgot" that the instability exists, or make you feel that you are punished because you have allies around.  
---
It just saddens me that you feel like any incentive to explore other possibilities of classes, compositions and gameplay patterns is just "gate". It's also annoying that you're using old argument of "if they changed something, that means it was bad" in case of game systems - which is honestly most of the time not true, or at least not when taking some parts of the system into consideration. Usually it only means that the design/balance team decided that they need to take new approach to refresh the content. Oh well, as they say - better is the enemy of good.
---
Raids.. Are different beast than fractals. They are powercreeped to the point of being easier than fractal CMs. They are easier to clear in lowman than with under performing squad member. From my experience only people complaining about specific roles like handkite, Dhuum kite, Desmina push are those that don't like particular gameplay pattern or just want to be carried with no effort put into the kill. Raids are also much easier to read due to usually singular opponent. The mechanics require specific roles to use specific utilities or other actions in timed, sometimes randomized manner. That's honestly the same as fractals new instabilities - all of them (other than birbs, fuk birbs) can be timed or player around. No, you don't need 100% uptime of all key boons, projectile hate, evasion or block to do so. Most of them just reduce the windows of opportunities, reward proper adaptations to changed rules, or force you to work on your movement patterns and positioning.
---
&gt;Anyway, it's good to know: PvP is toxic.
---
Find me a game where this isn't true. I'll wait.
---
People aren't saying they agree with the behavior, rather that you will always occasionally run into people like that in any PvP gamemode. 
---
Is it BMing/griefing etc? Sure you could argue that. Is it worth getting this bent out of shape and writing a whole post about it rather than just continuing on? Not at all, lol
---
well there is the issue...
---
My thoughts:
---
1. I feel dwarves are kinda done. There's no reason for there to be new dwarves (besides a complete about-face/retcon of "Hey, look! A secret self-sustaining population of dwarves that *no* one knew about!"). That doesn't mean we can't find out more about the ones that *did* exist, and it particularly might be nice to hear there side of the last dragonrise.
---
2. Kodan I... don't like. Maybe that's just personal, and maybe I'm distinguishing "I don't like them" vs "I don't like their story" well enough (this was one of my issues with people complaining about Braham in LWS3 and onwards), but an entire race based around "You're either kodan, or you're not good enough to be kodan" doesn't leave a huge amount of room in my mind for expansion
---
3. I'd really like to stay away from stories in the mists - by which I assume you mean stories where the "map" is somwhere in the non-Tyria mists - because of the ridiculous open-endedness of it. Unless it's handled really well, the mists can literally represent the sum total of all possibilities (i.e., any conflicts *and* any resolutions). That's sorta a Superman in the '50s problem - your story (or character) has so much power or ability that any potential conflict has got to either be A) way overblown, or B) require an absurd suspension of disbelief. Unless it's relegated to very specific sections of the mists, or very specific reasons - I think LWS4-4 and PoF both handled this *very* well - it could very easily be "Oh no, another issue? Lemme grab a Macguffin from the Mists!".
---
4. I never thought Giganticus Lupicuses (Giganticus Lupici? Gigantici Lupici? GLs) were actually *sapient*. We might get some interesting info on what caused their extinction (the last dragonrise?) but other than that...
---
5. In terms of which major race needs more lore, I'd probably go with either Norn (my first suggestion) or Asura. Norn because we know they're ancient - as ancient as Charr? Older? - and we know they are highly shamanistic, but... we don't really know a huge amount else. Asura because their recorded history basically stops at their exodus from the Depths of Tyria (both because so many records got destroyed, *and* because the Asura never really were much into looking backwards).
---
There are people who voted humans were the most culturally ignored characters... ?!?
