The hard way?  How was it hard?  How is it going to be easier to people after the changes?  Have you read what they are changing--I imagine not.  This sounds like a knee-jerk reaction without even looking into what you're upset about.
---

---
The amount of time you have to wait between Collections to unlock (after you finish them,) is shrinking from 24 hours to 2 hours.
---
The amount of food you can feed your Skyscale hatchling per day is going up from 3 to 4.  You still have to wait 24 hours to feed it 4 the next day.  This concludes in saving 24 hour period of waiting.
---
TLDR; they only reduced the amount of time you had to wait.  They did not remove any of the collections or what you had to do.  It is exactly the same.
---
---
---
PoF added a lot of useful elite specs (renegade, weaver, firebrand, soulbeast, holosmith, or deadeye for [fractals](https://discretize.eu/builds)) so you'll probably want it for that alone at higher tiers. There are 2 (3rd soon) raids for PoF as well on top of the 4 already in HoT. I'd suggest looking at [meta raid builds](https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/) to see what you're interested in playing (note that mirage doesn't have a benchmark due to it stacking confusion) or check the link for fractals above. The other major thing with PoF is of course mounts which are incredibly useful in open world for getting around. You can see some of the changes in the time since you left [here](http://www.nojamtoday.com/upload/guild_wars_2_content_and_feature_update_chart_290.png) (chart is over a year old now and doesn't have changes after PoF including the 2 new mounts and season 4).
---
Silverwastes had vines, some gates and the skritt tunels were closed.
---
Dry Top had a cave-in to access further parts and then a vine bridge grew later.
---
&gt;mordrem snipers are high dps but squishy af,
---
This is completely incorrect.  Normal Mordrem enemies do not have any more or less health than eachother.  They all have the same amount of health and take the same amount of damage to kill.
---
So glad i finished this Mini Dungeon when PoF first came out, and get all the Dwarven Weapons. The other achievements in there though...
---
Why voicing an opinion or concern must always be assimilated to "crying". Is it so much to ask that you consider it as what it is, people giving their thoughts on the topic?
---
Personally I think Steve (the deep sea dragon) is not going to appear anytime soon.  
---
I think if the writers wanted to use Steve, they would have introduced the character a lot sooner.  For example, Zaitan, Primordus and Kralk have been on the player character’s radar since day 1.  Since Steve hasn’t really been mentioned in the story, I think the writers are saving the character for a future storyline or a future plot twist.  
---
In theory, the Elder Dragons storyline is wrapped up for the time being since Kralk is dead and the other two are out of commission.  With Steve being largely untouched, they could return to the Elder Dragons story at any point in time.  They could easily do a “return of the Elder Dragons” storyline by having Steve eat a major city.  
---
That being said, I think Season 5 needs to focus on something not affiliated with the Elder Dragons.  I think if Season 5 immediately focused on Steve eating a major city, it would be repeating the storylines from Season 4.  I think Season 5 needs to serve as an epilogue to Season 4 as well as introduce a new major villain that has nothing to do with the Elder Dragons.  In a previous thread, I proposed the idea of having a 5 year time skip where the Commander has to come out of retirement to battle a new enemy.
---
This is probably the best way right now. Ectos are tanking in price because the new living world map poops them out like crazy. Crystalline dust is probably also falling in price because it can be salvaged from Ectos. Just buy ectos or scrounge up a bunch of rare gear and salvage away.
---
Just use black lion salvage kits on them.  I also like to use the skin until ive crafted the next tier, to add to the sense of my journey.  As others have said, salvaging your old precursors used to be a requirement for all legendaries, but they changed the system a bit for the second wave of them.  Stuff like Meteorlogicus still works like that
---
Definitely having trouble with completing the Path Of Fire storyline so will surely have a look into my gear (Which was obtained from the boost), Thanks for the response and information,
---
Great work. So cool ^_^
---
because people will always belittle those of a different opinion simply because they hold a different opinion. not much use trying to waste time arguing against ignorance, it's usually accompanied by stubbornness too.
---
&gt;don't try to run past mobs, they'll CC you to death.
---
What are you even talking about?  You should be running past the majority of mobs because they only get in your way lmao
---
I've used a heal scrapper with lots of barrier application. Alchemy/Inventions/Scrapper. Minstrel gear and antitoxin runes.
---
I was under the impression that Kralk consumed all of it because he was the only dragon in the vicinity upon his death and was able to soak up most if not all of it but that's just an assumption and definitely not something we know for sure.
---
Nice theory but what i don't buy about the whole "Kralk is a misunderstood grandfather buddy that is fighting his inner demons after absorbing magic from Zaithan, Mordremoth and Balthazar"-Story is the fact that he woke up from it's slumber and went on a killing spree before all that happened. Maybe it's just me but back in the day when Anet stated that Elder Dragons are a force of nature without a personal motive other than wiping out everything and going back to sleep i liked the story better than whatever they are trying to tell us now.
---
Good news is the next step will unlock 2 hours after the final feeding it seems and then the final collection two hours after completing that tier.
---
Not really crafting.  You shove quartz in a channel hp and then throw it in the forge.  You don't need actual crafting skills
---
\&gt;and they have a massive 3 second knockdown.   
---
I have literally never been KD'd by a smokescale.  What...???
---
Yeah I did read it, and I could have done every collection from start to finish in 3 hours, tops. Instead, because of said time gates, like you said, I had to wait at certain spots longer from collection to collection. I would have preferred to get it all done at once but couldnt and because of that, instead of doing my normal fracs for the night, or what I actually would prefer to be having fun doing, I had to do the collections with my time for the evening.
---
i watched that movie at an age where i didn't hate things if they differed from the source material at a noticeably lower quality (looking at you GoT season 5 to 8) but that movie did not compare at all to the books.
---
It's all about CPU.
---
Chronomancer is arguably the best offensive shield-user.
---
&gt;Boon chrono
---
Chrono in general\*
---
&gt; Why does it have to involve forced hours of downtime, 
---
.
---
&gt; For the skyscale in particular, the daily gates were designed for a couple of reasons, including the story—it doesn’t make sense for your skyscale to go from an egg to fully grown in a day
---
You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to run all my 8 characters through all LS maps doing hearts. It is going to be fun? No. I'll just do it because I'm sick of this collection and I just want the mount already.
---
Yeah no. Im done with this game FF14 got me with that obese flying chocobo.
---
The collections that were 24 hr gates are now 2 hrs a piece, so yeah even then they still make you fucking wait. I meant that if there were no gates in place for the Scales, then Sicks, then eggs, you can knock that shit out really fast. It did not take anywhere close to 5 hrs collectively for me to finish the first collection for the Scales.
---
Tell me it's just a very bad joke :/
---
Kinda wired that you have to do pve content in order to get pve shinies.
---
It just gets worse and worse.. /s
---
icky
---
YEP!!
---
is it a must or optioanl?
---
You just need to buy items, but there's at least 1 more achievement
---
Is this a joke? I swear its a joke right?
---
oh, i usually play raids and other pve content where you need a bit off skill and the rewards come from that. i am not used to do brainless openworld farms, sry.
---
Well considering a tyrian day is represented in 2 real world hours, there are 12 tyrian days in an earth day. 12x8=96 days or 3 months in tyrian time.
---
This is a very bad joke.
---
*Ooooocean man
---
can you see through the wonder of amazement at the oberman..*
---
Isn't like half of the hearts missions like this? The centaurs are defenelly being massacrated. Rs
---
I’ve seen it happen during the pre-event.  There isn’t a rhyme or reason afaik
---
What are the map currencies?
---
don't forget u can buy them with magic too now
---
Is it bad that I love the heart in Frostgorge where you literally just take a torch and light the Grawl’s stuff on fire?

[Like that opinion?](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/a9xmxq/the_official_forums_everybody/)
---
&gt;Raid #4, Bastion of the Penitent has us explore a prison frozen in time by a mists distortion. What we find at the end is the Eye of Janthir torturing Saul D'Alessio by immortalizing him... But for what purpose? To make him a puppet? For what? When did the White Mantle or Mursaat ever use Saul as a puppet?  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;hen it occurred to me: it wasn't Saul what they wanted. It was *Deimos*!
---
The White Mantle never used Saul as a puppet. The mursaat did, they used him to create the White Mantle and a religion based on worshiping them. They then used Dorion (Saul's successor), Justiciar Hablion, and Justiciar Thommis as puppets to spread the faith and influence. They wanted to use Saul and had at first offered him gifts but when he refused resorted to torture.
---
Devs (specifically, Bobby Stein, the lead writer for raids at the time) had 100% confirmed that the mursaat wanted Saul as a puppet. But they died out in short order during the events of Prophecies so even if he did give in they wouldn't have been around to collect on their puppetry.
---
They weren't interested in Deimos, they **had** Deimos already, and used Deimos to torture Saul.
---
&gt;I'd argue that the Deimos area is NOT the Realm of Torment as some players speculate, but a mirror world that has to do with the magic.
---
I may be mistaken, but isn't it stated that players are transported to a "shadow realm" or "spirit realm"? I don't raid often but I seem to recall such.
---
&gt;Now, what exactly is ascension? In every case we know of individuals ascending, there always appears to be fighting some sort of evil doppleganger involved. Going way back in GW1, we of course fight a doppleganger. Since then, I think the lore was expanded to be more specific: Ascension is to fight demons of torment from the mirror world!  
---
&gt;\[...\]  
---
&gt;There is a mirror world to Tyria where negative emotions and magic give birth to torment demons, who influence the fears and madness of their hosts. In order to become ascended, one must defeat their own doppleganger, their inner demon. By becoming ascended, you gain the ability to access this mirror world and fight other people's inner demons.
---
You don't fight dopplegangers when ascending in Cantha. Weh no Su (aka Closer to the Stars) is another form of Ascension. Dopplegangers are not a requirement. In fact, Ascension in Prophecies was more focused on the three trials and obtaining the (then) Five Gods' attention. Fighting the Doppleganger was just the final step of a four step process.
---
As for what Ascension is: it's the ability to unlock one's true potential, and gain the Gift of True Sight. What does that mean? Unlocking one's true potential is fairly self explanatory - it let's you use every ounce of magic in you, more than most mortals but not as much as beings like demigods. Gift of True Sight allows one to see souls and other beings who hide in the "Spirit Realm" - the place where the Mists and Tyria overlaps (aka we were go in the norn "Defend the Mists" PS). Thus why it allowed GW1 players to see mursaat or souls who wanted to hide from mortal view.
---
The Eye of Janthir can also grant the Gift of True Sight, temporarily. This is what happens during the Lazarus fight in One Path Ends. I'd imagine the same principle is occurring during the Deimos fight.
---
That mirror world that mursaat phase into, btw, is the spirit realm. Same place havrouns and souls can slip in and out of. And it seems, the same place the Voice of Koda is connected to. This "mirror Tyria" does exist, but it is far from malevolent as you think it is. It's just where the Mists and Tyria overlap.
---
&gt;Putting the facts together, both Deimos and Kralkatorrik's Torment require ascension to enter an alternate dimension, where you fight a figure of their psyche. Kralkatorrik, Deimos, and Shadow Aurene were all torment creatures born from negativity, who could only be fought by creatures capable of ascension.
---
Kralkatorrik's Torment doesn't require ascension (the Commander is not Ascended).
---
And "Shadow Aurene" as you call it was created by Glint, in the Mists, as part of the trials. It's a phantasm, not a true thing, not its own thing.
---
&gt;Kralkatorrik's Torment and Deimos are the same type of creature, and are the same creatures as Dopplegangers and Aurene's fears. There is a mirror world only the Ascended can see, where these demons can be fought. Unbound magic gives birth to these demons. 
---
Doesn't the Guild Chat pretty much debunk this? Kralkatorrik's Torment is part of his own mind. Deimos is a demon born from the Mists, merely shaped by Saul's mind. There's a difference. And dopplegangers are definitely not the same as Deimos, as they're not demonic in nature - they seem closer to the anomalies than demons.
---
On top of that, the doppleganger in Elon Riverlands shows up when we **disperse** magic, so it isn't being born from magic, but rather, being born from the *lack* of magic.
---
I like the timegate mount too. But I don't think most people don't like the update anyway. Everyone in my guild seems too. But that doesn't mean most people like the time gating.
---
The advantage, for me anyway, is that it feels like a process, so when I finally get the mount it'll feel like it's my mount. Not like buying a springer from a heart guy after five minutes. 
---
But I think most people probably don't like the time gating. That's not the same as liking the story or liking the zone, which I think most people do like. 
---
But you know, once this community has a hot button topic, everything else gets put on hold until it's fixed. You should be used to it by now.
---
Never. One of the flaws in OP.
---
Good thing ls4 reward tracks give nice income and a lot of currency.
---
If only players would've known and could've farmed all these currencies while being timegated... fkin pepega.
---
you must craft it
---
No. Spending gold instead of waiting on the timegate to craft things was a choice that was not forced in anyone. Think of it as impatience tax.
---
Or kick 'shiny' stuff over in skritt's cave in queensdale
---
The skyscale is only relevant for open world though, not for fractals nor raids. You are just a crybaby at this point
---
ah damn just spent all my volatile magic for trophies.... woops
---
"Suffer" the time gate wasn't even that bad.
---
Sorry, I missed the k at the end of 100.
---
Everything in gw2 is optional, including the skyscale.
---
Placing my bet now that the first episode of Season 5 will be called Dragonrise or something of the sort if the ocean dragon comes to visit.
---
Well, that I have cause I never use any of that shit. Not that I'll ever get to that part cause _I hate collections so very much._
---
Kralkatorrik, voiced by Samuel L Jackson.
---
i said i do not farm openworld brainlessly, not that i do not play it at all.  
---
but from doing some events once or twice you do not get 250 of anything.
---
The personal experience of the timegate is exactly that, personal.
---
I do sympathize with people that don't feel the same way.  But asking for reasons is pointless.  Why this and why that.
---
The argument has been made a few times that it's immersive, that it engages you in playing more often and it ensures that people are more in the same place. 
---
The counterargument have been made that in some instances it makes it harder to achieve for players that miss the train and are doing it when most are done.
---
For me, and this is just for me, my humble opinion.  For me, it sounds that most people that complain about these kind of things don't really want to play the game, they seem just want the achievements without any real effort, now, I might be wrong about certain individuals, but in general, this is how I perceive those who complain about these kind of things.  If it takes 4 days, a week, a month.  Then that is the devs decision and I can choose to do the achievements or I can not, that is up to me, but to complain about it, in my opinion is not an option for me.
---
How long do legendarilies take, how long did it take to farm for ascended gear, that was timegated too, didn't bother me then, doesn't bother me now.
---
Yeah look at me, I put effort in, fuck me right?
---
Ahh I remember this fight my character was so very naked by the end
---
Absolutely this.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Another thing that grinds my gears is all the new armor they add always has this stupid shine to it, even shadow abyss it'll still be metallic/glowy sheen which ruins mixing it with older skins.
---
They made full guides for previous achievements  again, like beetle.
---
Every time an ogre says "who will take care of...?" as he dies, another piece of my soul falls away.
---
but what's stopping them from saying a future collection takes 2 weeks of Tyrian time... that'd be just over 24 hours D:
---
All in all, the cost of skyscale is very similar to the cost of griffon (taking current prices into account). The only difference is you dont spend any gold, you just lose it by not converting ls4 map currencies into gold.
---
Beyond getting the mastery points, I'm not sure how much people run the "adventures" mini-games in Heart of Thorns.
---
Yup, I'm done with this collection.
---
\#TeamGriffon
---
Ffs
---
Druid backpack/Aurora all over again.
---
Everything doesn't have to be a on/off switch. What is the matter with Anet adding a tiny amount of realism? It would technically make sense if it went off the time scale of GW2 days.
---
It just boils down to people wanting to unlock the mount day one. I simply don't the issue, I would embrace having to raise mounts before using them. It would make me feel more connected to it, a achievement. I see it something that makes me want to log in everyday and **work** on **achieving** something. 
---
Maybe it was just the way Anet went about it, but it could be worked on.
---
Not elitism. You mean you have more time in your life. I always have respect those who done it the hardcore way tho
---
Eh, I meant what Balthazar absorbed from Primordus and Jormag.
---
Thx for the correction
---
The only thing that's gonna be a problem is the kralkatite. I've been making astral weapons. Fuck me, right?
---
Which sword is that?
---
Except it already looks right with male humanoids. I'm also fairly certain this exact animation is not used on any weapon aside from dagger and I'm not even sure it is used outside of this move.
---
its always at the stage before that for me, like always, as soon as all the camps (well not literally immediately, but within a minute or two) are settled in up pops the volunteer prompt
---
A mother of an Elder Dragon is an origin of an Elder Dragon (its mother) though.
---
So is this the last collection? Do you still need to wait for reset to obtain the skyscale or do you already have it once this collection is complete
---
What?  Spirit Shards could be obtained fine until PoF, then they hotfixed it shortly after it was discovered.  This problem did not occur again until this LWS4 episode released 6 days ago, and it was hotfixed 2 days ago.
---
You likely haven't missed out on anything much.
---
I just did the exact same thing and totally want to die. Think we were supposed to talk to him after we fed the last 3 and didn't, so now its just en extra day.
---
yup, I cleared out all my LS4 currencies to get a surplus of volatile magic for this episode.
---
What I need to know is how do we use this knowledge to flood the world with Margonites?
---
I was mainly speaking for new PoF players.
---
I KNEW IT!!!
---
You can get 75 per character from hearts on the map. I realised a few days ago I was short on them for this so I made sure to run it once a day.
---
The gold requires is essentially 50% less than the Griffon.
---
Huzzah to the hero of Shaemoor!!
---
^-^
---
I'm fine with it. I did Aurora, this collection is nothing.
---
Oh ok thought you just meant the scales.
---
Awww what a cutie! Come here little wha- AAAAH! HEEEEEELP!
---
Joko was right.
---
They were very clear that he was never *good*. He just wasn't as devastatingly destructive.
---
I’m loving it so far!
---
That's a charr heart.
---
Everybody needs a friend.
---
Hello guys  
---
I have read gw2 wiki, but I want to make sure, I've been farming for the gloves box for 2 days and still didn't get it, do I get the gloves box from these small airship cargos spread all over the map?
---
*technically* the post is still accurate, there just happens to also be a workaround.
---
I came back a couple of weeks ago after I quit shortly after PoF released hoping they improved the content, this shit is making me quit again, have no time for slave labor farming.
---
I want to  have fun in my limited irl time, plenty of other games to spend my valuable time in.
---
Next elite confirmed. Finally fixing the class. Thats it.
---
We, humans, are political creatures. We choose a side and betray at times
---
Good video OP, I fucking miss no downstate it has been some of the most fun roaming on holo since POF launch. Feels so satisfying to chain cc burst someone into full death while they're heal firebrand/scrapper buddy looks on in helplessness. Downstate truly only helps the team that already has the advantage. As a solo roamer downstate means certain death anyway just as dying in a smaller zerg v larger zerg is likely death to you and anyone foolish enough to try and res you. In the end it only helps the person or team who is larger/stronger...where you shouldn't be going into downstate anyway.
---
were going to cantha boissss
---
TIPs for farming those LS4 map currencys  fast?
---
If anet somehow makes underwater combat so fun we don't even come out of the water, hands down it'll be the best MMO in history.
---
Oops! I misremembered. Well then, no you are being completely normal lol.
---
I'm not so far yet, but honestly, I'm not fussed.
---
More disappointed to the upcoming nerfs to the timegates than this tbh.
---
I'd like it more without the snow/ashes filter (which actually seem like stars).
---
Looool Aurora.
---
Yes, but it's up to chance.
---
You could also just buy them from the itzel vendor if you have the mastery
---
Cant time gate your pay check. Gotta sell those mountskins some how.
---
I like DS meta unless the map is lowmanned and cannot do the last phase properly
---
The update to change some of the timegating isn't out until the 28th. Bit more time to wait.
---
Yeah, I just realized it now. Some nerfs happened before.
---
map completition on different chars
---
Why is there a picture of the griffon?
---
So basically what we all assumed the legendary trinket would want.
---
i feel the same, and was so surprised the first time i saw a friendly ogre heart (charr zone i think? where you put chickens back in their coop) but was also nice to see
---
The main post is about the guy liking the story and the zone and liking the time gate. The problem is so many people are complaining about the time gate, all the good stuff gets lost in the shuffle. Do you really think everyone's hard work needs to be sublimated by 4000 complaints when in fact, most people do like the zone or do like the story? Because new people coming to this channel, all they'll end up seeing is complaint after complaint. Completely brushing over the fact that most people seem to enjoy the zone. Why not let EVERYONE have their say.
---
You're trying to make this post about the time gate, but that's not actually what the post is about. Why are you so threatened by someone liking other stuff in the episode as well as the time gate?
---
is the last collection easy? any money needed?
---
Da fuc
---
What is in her left hand? It looks like a shield but the grip isn't even remotely aligned with the other part.
---
1 gold and 500 airship parts
---
At this point I am being stubborn and just want it over with.
---
Will it be worth it in the end? Maybe. Do I hate doing this? Yes.
---
&gt; It's purely a figure of speech, relax.
---
For most of the expression's existence, this has *not* been the case.
---
Can’t I also buy it from vendors with Volatile Magic?
---
Where do we sit? Because i'm not sitting on those spikes.

Congratulations. I am happy that all the extreme crying will end now

Portable toilet, the teleport back Gizmo from sandswept isles

you can only buy 5 per day
---
Considering you are given a literal recipe for it, it's not exactly discovery.
---
I'm an elitist because I want people to do the same thing as I did?
---
Great.
---
I'm pretty fine. It gives me a reason to revisit all these old maps that I haven't  seen in months.
---
But they wanted this pet to feel different. For some of us, myself included, the way it's set up makes it feel more like mine than any of the other mounts, including the griffon. This is more personal. I'm  curing it, gathering the egg, there for it's hatching, raising it. Playing with it. To me that makes a huge difference in how I feel about the mount. 
---
And doing that all in one day would not be the same for me, even if it would be the same for you. 
---
The fact is, Anet made fixes, they're a decent compromise and people still feel the need to post about a topic that's not only been done to death but that some of us don't have a problem with. 
---
You may not agree with dev decisions but I certainly see the reason for them, even if it was over done.
---
What beings are you referring to?
---
To be honest, there weren't that many sigils to start off with so they could have very well been bought by those that used them.
---
As for the other items you mentioned, there's nothing wrong with those prices going up because they at least had reasonable methods to acquire them compared to the sigil.
---
That's weird.  I thought for sure I was playing raids to get legendary armor.
---
Not me, especially not a subpar niche mount. I'd rather fork over hundreds of gold to bypass the entire thing and just buy it directly.
---
Because the mount is tied to an entire season? Just like Aurora? DUH?
---
Nah. The Two. Grenth and Melandru are the only ones that don't need to be hit with something.
---
Like I said, DEPLOY THE CHAIRS!
---
the fact that they (along with the skritt, grawl, quaggan etc.) are referred to as one of tyria's 'lesser races' really gives uncomfortable ubermensch vibes
---
for shame, playable races, for shame
---
I'm really confused as to what you do in the game that doesn't require any crafting at all. Are you a PvP player because they don't need mounts at all? PvE needs crafting for a lot of the end game stuff and for many collections.
---
Oh Hey....I can see myself!
---
Mastery 3 done.

Trust me, I’m not saying Anet is a perfect company. Especially how much living world map currency I’m gonna need to finish part 5 of the collections.
---
I'm the orange cat tag in the tower. :D
---
You, me and debris.
---
The raid is the content.  The legendary armor is a skin.  You dont use your abilities or play the game differently in any way if you have a legendary vs an ascended.
---
Yeah, it doesn’t make sense that Aurene can choose where her portal goes. /s
---
Our long national nightmare of a week of barely doing things to get something unnecessary is over! Whew!
---
What’s a good strategy for getting the currencies besides Kralkatite?
---
&gt;2063934_0034	Hovering next to rifts will close them and reveal flight paths for your skyscale. Follow them to claim the treasure at the end. But don't miss a node along the way! Your final reward is largest if you touch every node.
---
Can you please show what the reward is?
---
How long would it take with just one character?

Gameplay is also designing the content that you could have stockpiled materials beforehand,  you could have played the content that generated charged quartz,  you could have played content that generated money that fosters an economy between players.  
---
Instead, you just want to piss away 40g to an NPC in the most non interactive way possible.  Which is even less gameplay content by the way.
---
also volatile magic
---
250? Vomit
---
permanent bank is my most used QoL in the game. as for GIzmo the portable position rewind device is amazing and definately earned a spot within my shared inventory

I really want to see Snargle's reaction to the scene at the start of the episode. Like I feel I will live for that moment. : P

Because games should be fun instead of a carebear costume fest. Why have this extensive awesome combat system if all "content" is zerg and press F
---
There are usually people that hoard the really cheap stuff with buy orders in the hope of striking it rich because of stuff like this.  Maybe this is just a symptom of mmos in this regard.  Regarding grow lamp I wouldn't call that reasonable because its only half of the story.  There's also 12 pieces of Skyscale food.  I am fine I have plenty of charged quartz but I can't imagine what its like for a relatively newer player excited to get their first flying mount only to have to wait 22 days, 10 for the grow 12 for the food (80 gold total) to progress in their collection.
---
I think these are getting pretty old, given how current they are. I'd suggest trying to explore other details if possible. I'm sure something related to the Skyscale could cheer some people up.
---
If I only really have one 80  character, is hearts the best bet ?
---
That's actually really amazing. I know you're probably getting more negative than positive, ANet, and I'm sure you know that's how it works with forums like these. I was less irked, but still silently annoyed. Just want to say I really like this. With a full time job, two D&amp;D games, and a fiance, I'd stopped progressing out of the sheer daunting scale of it. Unlike other things, this felt like a pressing thing I needed to work on before I got back to my normal endgame goals.
---
Thanks ANet! :)
---
250 of each LS4 currency is not much! So stop crying ...
---
So this is how death feels like.
---
I'm starting to feel like griffon cost far less than skyscale
---
what masteries are available for it? 
---
Does it have one for climbing walls/cliffs?
---
I spent all my Mistonium after farming like crazy on the map feature armor so I got the middle finger as well.
---
this is exactly how i feel about it. i really wish now it would have been another trinket instead of this.
---
Nah they said they were too lazy to get the mastery points needed. So even with this change, which was hotfixed two days ago, they still won't earn spirit shards because they're too lazy to get the full mastery points. I have over 1k spirit shards with nothing to spend them on, myself...
---
Yes, which is a matter of convenience and gold saving, not gameplay, however.
---
How do you unlock the saddle collection? Just finished troublesome
---
i was expecting more praise for the airship after the party boat in episode 2, being that it was the 1st moving entity with collision
---
rip aurora 2.0 dream
---
AEEEEETHHHEEEEERRRR
---
There's not really much wrong with it to begin with, just that Anet didn't set us up expecting it properly. Had they told us ahead of time, it would have made a lot less people angry.
---
That being said, you can now do large parts of the collection 12x as fast as you were able to before, so yea. It's better.
---
I'm not sure of the point of this post. I can't remember any MMO that hasn't changed over 6.5 years. I mean this was made a couple of years before launch, of course times have changed.
---
And for every bad change, there's also good changes. We didn't have wardrobes at launch, dyes were character bound, there was culling in WvW, the rewards in PvP were complete crap, there were no champ bags, dungeon rewards were inadequate. Hell at launch we didn't even have fractals.
---
Sure the game has changed. In some ways for the better...in other ways, not so much.
---
You have your skyscale I'm assuming?
---
She my friend! It looks like her shield. I believe she uses the [Shield of the Goddess](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shield_of_the_Goddess).
---
TRADE CONTRACTS: Go to the Tomb of the Primeval Kings and open up the chests there. Can do this on multiple characters per day.
---
I do
---
Can I ask how you got the saddle collection to unlock? I just finished troublesome skyscales and I'm not sure what to do next. Also congrats btw
---
Air Rescue - Mount Midflight
---
  
---
Rift Repair - Hovering next to rifts will close them and reveal flight paths for your skyscale. Follow them to claim the treasure at the end. But don't miss a node a long the way! Your final reward is largest if you touch every node. 
---
Wall Launch -  While clining to the wall with your skyscale, Hold the jump key to charge your flight meter, and then release it to launch into the air. This requires at least one bar of endurance.  
---
RIFT REWARD - (1) Mist Mote.
---
yeah, i just calculated the price of 12 skyscale foods, 1 grow lamp, and 21 of the skyscale treats (for skipping the jp's) and that's all about 200g at current market prices.
---
so 235g total. maybe even more if you consider the value of trade contracts, volatile magic, and map materials which can be converted into more volatile magic.
---
I'd honestly say it costs more than the griffin and has more collection steps, as well
---
That was a fun one
---
They're ribbed for your pleasure tho.
---
I’m pretty sure that’s a bug that happens even if the map is full. Every meta I’ve done has had that come up even though we have multiple commanders with squads
---
Dude majority of the missions involve us evicting some poor group of "lesser" race folk from their homes.
---
At least though the reason we do it because there is an assumed "they started it". But still kinda feels very colonialist
---
Just to make sure, the first map currency is Kralkatite Ore, not Kralkatite Ingots, correct? Cuz ore is trivial, ingots would be a problem
---
There’s that heart mission where you literally capture dolyak calfs in front of their mothers, leading you to frequently kill their mothers in front of the calfs.
---
Kralkatite Ore: Domain of Istan on the Isle of Istan, southwestern Elona.            
---
Difluorite Crystal: Sandswept Isles in Dajkah, western Elona.         
---
Inscribed Shard: Domain of Kourna in Kourna, southeastern Elona.          
---
Lump of Mistonium: Jahai Bluffs in Kourna, southeastern Elona.           
---
Branded Mass  Thunderhead Peaks in the Deldrimor Front, southern Shiverpeak Mountains.              
---
Mistborn Mote: Dragonfall in the Unending Ocean, off the coast of the Scavenger's Causeway.
---
I've had a friend join me during the last 6 weak spots, so it might just be closed to additional players after Kralk goes into remission.
---
It’s just the asura’s sword, the sylvari stole it and that’s why it’s so small
---
Gameplay are the things you actually do in the game.  Its how you interact with the world, how you fight, how you move on a basic level.  Legendaries are skins + convenience.  Skins they look cool but do not change anything related to how you fight or move or play.  Convenience with stat swapping.  That's a quality of life feature like the convenience of having more bag slots or teleport to friend.
---
If you finished Troublesome after this recent daily reset...you have to wait till tomorrows reset.
---
Here's a prediction for you: The Deep Sea Dragon is literally the planet itself and is the mother or creator or source of all of the other dragons.
---
I swear I got a step in djinn bottler from him as well
---
That one actually had me like, “wtf am I doing?”
---
I agree. I think Anet was thinking too hard on, "How can I look like a creative designer." In doing so they've made several collections that I would attribute as being tedious, annoying and downright stupid. It's a large pile of bad decisions that have lead to nobody being happy or having fun. 
---
I was both surprised and glad that anet decided to open dialouge with the playerbase about potential changes. Although, I was hoping that they would do more than what they're proposing because I feel that that is not enough.
---
The game has a [very convenient wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Main_Page) with info about literally everything on it. Its search function is even accessible in game with the command "/wiki [whatever you're searching]"
---
For gear, all greens should always be salvaged for materials with a Basic salvaging kit. Oranges should be kept only if they have better stat combos than your current gear. Yellows and Oranges should be salvaged using a Mystic salvage kit.
---
You can open all those containers. Ideally, you can double the material value of some of them if opened on a Lv. 50 character, but that doesn't really matter for a new player.
---
Unidentified Gear, if you're salvaging, should always be identified first. Each one you identify has a chance to actually be higher rarity than its own, and no drawback other than extra clicks and bag space.
---
Trophy items, go to any vendor, go to sell, and click Sell Junk, which sells all the random crap items with no in-game purpose.
---
It's unclear what type of gathering tools those are, but if they're Orichalcum, they should either be equipped or kept as backup for when your current ones run out.
---
Yellow recipe books don't really matter. You can sell or consume whatever you pick from them and half the time you're lucky if somebody buys them.
---
For the purple recipe book, I can't see exactly what it is, but Zojja's (Berserker's) for whatever your character can use is always a good choice. Not too expensive relatively, pretty common in meta, and can be switched to another stat after crafting for cheaper than crafting some of the fancier gear stats from scratch.
---
I took leave on May 13th just want to get Skyscale as soon as possible, then you told me this achievement can't be complete in 1 day. So I can do nothing at those days for my Skyscale.
---
And now you tell me the achievement needs a lot of currency that I was able to use my leave to prepare?
---
Time is more valuable than in game gold. So yes, you're right!
---
I have a harried renegade, works well but quite hard to play. It heals quite consistently and provides perma alacrity and 20stacks of might 
---
Though I do find myself die more often comparing to playing healbrand, but overall team support ability is much in my opinion against bosses don’t run around all the time
---
But when boss is running, it sucks lol...
---
Tyria the Planet?
---
We're getting into some Azeorth/Argus shit.
---
Yeah I’m really liking my Ele. I started a necromancer and within like 3 levels I was like naw, something different please. Started this ele and now I’m totally addicted
---
I'm pissed that I will do it. I've really got nothing else to do right now but chip at it...
---
But yes, I'm very exhausted &amp; I hate this dragon.
---
I'm using the GeForce Experience recommended settings (except I change Fullscreen to Windowed Fullscreen).  I can screencap my settings if you like.
---
I'm also running an i7-6700k o/c by a modest amount (between 10-15%).
---
This really makes me frustrated and angry. :(
---
Protip: NEVER take leave when new content drops in. Bugs and errors could happen. Things like this could happen.
---
It's never worth it imo.
---
\&gt; For the skyscale in particular, the daily gates were designed for a couple of reasons, including the story—it doesn’t make sense for your skyscale to go from an egg to fully grown in a day. However, we recognize that there are stronger ways to create a sense of progression toward a reward. We’ll continue to learn from this as we develop future releases. 
---
I get where they are coming from. But here's the thing. It's the same problem that players have had with the legendary. Where a good deal of it doesn't feel very interactive, or it's just feels like frivelous effort 'just because.'
---
The reception of the skyscale's timegates probably would have been a LOT different if the quest for it had been handled like an episodic adventure. And not an episodic collection or chores. Think of the player's adventures with aurene when you were first introduced to her. You played with her. You taught her. You showed her things. And there was quite a bit of care and detailed placed in.
---
Think of how powerful it would have been... if the first day you're feeding this little bastard you'e playing with it. Make an adventure that the players need to make gold on. Like give the player control over the skyscale baby and run around chasing fireflies or something. Second day, probably something like teaching it how to hunt. Third day teaching it how to fly.
---
It's sounding a lot like nobody on the writing team has ever heard of Chekov's Gun.
---
I think it's almost time to start a new series
---
Trashnet.
---
I think the problem is not that the Skyscale has time-gating but rather the Skyscale has “multi-layered” time-gating.  There’s time-gating associated with feeding, time-gating associated with charged quartz, time-gating associated with the required meta-events etc.  
---
I think the trick to use time-gating is to keep it at a single layer.  For example in the Warlords of Draenor expansion for World of Warcraft, there was time-gating associated with crafting the legendary ring.  You had to collect items that only dropped from defeating Raid bosses.  Raid boss loot is capped at a weekly lockout.  For people (such as myself) that wanted the legendary ring faster, you could do Raider Finder difficulty and Normal difficulty since they have separate weekly lockouts.  There was no cap on how many items you could get per day and the weekly lockouts were the only time gate.  Depending on the type of player you were, you might do 1 raid per day or try to cram all of the raids into a Sunday afternoon.  
---
The problem with GW2 is that the required items for the Skyscale quests have “separate time-gates” associated with them.  When items have separate time-gates, it requires rostering your gameplay around multiple time requirements which is not a fun activity.  It also creates needless complexity for what is meant to be a fun, time consuming quest.  
---
I think one of the things the developers need to do is increase the amount of Charged Quartz you can craft per day.  Personally I think they should the amount to 5 Charged Quartz per day and/or provide some sort of alternate way to obtain Charged Quartz.  Also I think there needs to be multiple pathways to obtain the “important items”.  
---
Lastly I think the Skyscale, in terms of how it controls, feels unfinished.  I particularly didn’t like how the Skycale grappled vertical surfaces.  When you grapple a vertical surface, you’re sort of stuck to it with super glue and it I somewhat fiddly to unstick yourself.  When flying over a small landmass, you have to give it a wide berth otherwise you auto-stick to vertical/diagonal surface.  The Skyscale also needs a more elegant way to reduce altitude.  It seems like the best way to reduce altitude is to dismount and use a glider.
---

---
how does one get lots of volatile magic? they sure seem to have kneecapped it compared to the unbound stuff.
---
end? with it needing 250 of each LS4 map currency the real crying is about to begin.
---
Noting registering for me either.
---
You gotta go to the heart vendor after completion and buy the bundles with karma.
---
I stockpiled a minimum 250 of each episode currency because I was hoping for an LS4 equivalent of Aurora
---
... really hope the Skyscale completion comes with a gift to make a new legendary trinket :(
---
If you don't go for every single achievement in the game and you already have girffon, I'd say it's not worth it. I will break out of maps with it but mostly AFK on it in aerodrome.
---
Time *is* gold
---
I assume you're talking about shattered observatory.  If so, I have to pay more attention to what the npc's are saying.  Going off what you're saying, it sounds like I'm missing out on some interesting lore.
---
Then it would die of starvation because we could only feed it once every 12 days.
---
Not sure why it marked as a "Question", sorry about that
---
I was on the fence about getting the skyscale already since I don't have all of LS4 unlocked. 
---
This is now a definitive nope from me
---
yes.
---
Next living story: The Creatures of Tyria V. the Commander
---
Yeah this makes sense, in the Original Guild Wars, Shiro wielded daggers because they could double strike (or had a higher chance of it, I can't remember), but his daggers used a sword skin, I think they switched it over to sword because there are no daggers in this game that look like swords, plus, they'd be wielded weirdly if they did.
---
Just as soon as the game stops being published in China, sure.
---
Ironically they can't make it 'worth it', because if they do than it puts new players at a serious disadvantage.
---
It drops from level 76-80 enemies that are magical in nature or are often manipulating magic: Dragon minions, ghosts, demons, elementals, inquest...
---
And skritt. Those guys must have the longest drop tables. They drop all sorts of random stuff. 
---
You could say it's basically powdered magic.
---
But it's way faster to do metas that reward lots of rare gear, salvage the rare gear for ecto, then salvage the ecto for dust.
---
You'll also get tons of luck if you don't have 300% already.
---
they're all over the world map. when you touch one you get a message saying you need a skyscale mastery to use it.
---
should be 12 points
---
This isn't suppose to be a gold sink, 35g for saddle
---
The main thing I'm curious about is how does it fare once you've gotten all the masteries?
---
Everybody does. Give us 4-5 maps an Xpac, with 1-2 good metas on them and the rest of it more bustling with smaller events and lots to explore and do in them like PoF/core maps.
---
An Xpac with all PoF maps and no good meta events has no replayability, an all meta set of maps like HoT was boring outside the metas because they were basically built for the metas alone.
---
**balance* in all things.
---
- 41g raw gold
---
- 1500VM + 250 kralkatite ore (1000VM) + 250 other 5 maps (1250*20 = 25000VM) = 27500 VM, ~128g if eaten and bought trophy shipments
---
- 30g grow lamp (even if you craft yourself it's opportunity cost, you could've sold for that much to other players)
---
- 12 skyscale food @ 3g each, 36g
---
Total = 235g
---
Did you complete the sequence?
---
You likely need to gather all the orbs and complete the mini-game for a rift to count towards progress.
---
I did my 50th just today
---
At the same time, no one's ever really gone
---
I doubt I would've made the legendary trinket anytime soon, but I wanted to get the node to add to my instance farm.
---
Don't worry...with Anet writing, noone is ever really gone
---
Ye, did that shit almost 3 years ago and it was a breeze to just run in and grab my item.
---
It still appear everywhere. I haven't finished the side story yet and i see it popping everywhere.
---
So looks like it's a bit better at gaining altitude once you've got all the masteries.
---
None of the maps worked for me. I tried all living story season 4 maps, got the one mistborn mote reward for all of them but nothing registered. 
---
There is only one rift on every map right? They didn't put a separate one just for the achievement?
---
Not working for me either.
---
The wall jumping is a night and day difference. It's a wonderful creature to explore with!
---
I live in Asia actually, while I wake up to play the new episode it's about 8 hr after the release, so the bugs usually won't bother me. :)
---
And "things like this" never happens in GW2 before, isn't it?
---
This is why I decide to leave a comment about why I feel upset about Skyscale collection, I really don't want to see this kind of content in the game I love.
---
It's course and rough
---
almost as expensive as griffon :(
---
Where this vendor?
---
I've also heard it explained that Zhaitan's weakness was his armies. He was able to be everywhere at once through creating his Eyes/Mouths of Zhaitan. However, those things could be isolated and killed, rendering him blind and starving.
---
That’s really good calculation! I’ve never tried to list all requirement out and put them into maths. I guess I feel like it costs more that griffon is because I don’t have enough map currency and that requires time to farm, where you can use that time to engage in other activities to earn more gold
---
Right next to the first wp, second tab.
---
Skybox.exe
---
and they said the griffin would be faster, smh
---
uh, no. that doesn't happen because of one chief reason: *the Human Gods bestowed the Gift of True Sight (Ascension), and they didn't stick around for long after Guild Wars: Nightfall*.
---
you're referring to the when Ogden does a ritual **similar** to that of ascension to summon Turai Ossa so we can use his Divine Fire. we didn't ascend, we used a special magical torch that let us open a cave in which we thought Caithe had been hiding.
---
The collection is easy af and laid back, you can do it while watching netflix, why would you go on "kill me noe i just want it to be over" mode? is not close to aurora ...
---
Share with class how mindless farming and pressing F at spots on a map isn't the apex of casual content.
---
Hopefully not. GW2 has one of the fairest progression systems and monetizations I’ve ever seen. I’m honestly pretty convinced that it’s part of the niche. They’d lose a whole ton of players if they ever did that.
---
what did you see that I intentionally do? Or is it just another meme?
---
Also, take a good look at your end-game GW2 character. If you were in BDO, you’d look like a stub with a dead eagle on your head.
---
Maybe, but I don’t think it’s a stretch of the imagination.
---
Playing core ranger will get you in touch with :
---
- pets / pet management
---
- weapon skills / choices
---
- utility skills / choices
---
- traitlines
---
While druid will just add 1 trait line, 1 weapon, few utility skills and the avatar mode (basically 1 extra weapon kit with resource).
---
So if you already maxed at least one other char and you are confident about learning everything at once, go for it. If not I'd recommend the "classic way"
---
This has no impact on players who are well into the sky scale collection. It might be of some comfort to players who have yet to start. As for me, this doesn't impact me the slightest.
---
At least, my stockpile of charged quartz has some use/value. I was thinking that anet  would remove the timegating on charged quartz since that was the biggest complaint, apparently not.
---
3440x1440 on a GTX 960 with high settings, some things turned to ultra, less important things on medium. 50-70 fps in Crystal Desert and about 45 in WvW, medium model count + quantity. I run a Ryzen 2700X cpu that takes the brunt of it. The 960 has been running 1440p surprisingly well on most of my games, its caught me off guard for a 4 year old entry level card.
---
This is the guy who built palaces made of centaur skeletons, yes?
---
Genuine doubt - does the game explicitly statec/all them as lesser race? Or is it our interpretation like that?
---
M: I mean, why skull though? Why skulls?
---
W: Maybe they are the skulls of our enemies?
---
M: Maybe ... but is that how it comes across? I mean, it doesn't say next to the skull you know: "Yeah we killed him but trust us, this guy was horrid."
---
My biggest problem with the astral and Stellar weapons is how much kralkatite ore you need for a full set of ascended....I farmed hearts on all my characters for a very long time ...
---
&gt; I am super hyped that I won’t have to grind 250 gold this time!
---
The time you spend on doing these tasks is worth more than 250 gold. Time &gt; Gold.
---
I wish I knew this before being time gated for a week. Could have used the spare time to farm the currencies or getting alts to LWS4 maps, instead of waiting for bridge events to happen at Dragonfall. -_-
---
On the core story when you as part of an order have to pick another race to help they are specifically called “lesser races” bu your mentor if I remember correctly.
---
If there is a legendary trinket at the end of this, I’ll likely be more motivated.
---
So you’d just be beating up ogres that were bruised and broken by previous adventurers? A life of torture vs the sweet embrace of death
---
That's like a week farming at worst
---
Unpopular opinion: I'm in a node war guild in BDO and I would've rather grinded mobs for 20 hours for another 1% xp or snipe the market all day, than actually invest the time in the Skyscale collections. Except Saving Skyscales, that one was actually good.
---
It’s manifest destiny
---
This is definately not a problem...you're just want to be spoonfed at this point.
---
They were even kind enough to give you a episodes for free before this episode. This almost saves you 400g to unlock if you don't have them. 
---
They have already mentioned that skyscale is supposed to be on the level of griffon which costs about 250 gold and some collections. Skysclae however doesnt have that heavy of gold grind instead we have map currency. There were already many complaints that season 4 maps had no repeatability. At least this would add some use for those maps.
---
doesnt help by the lamp.
---
10 Charged Quartz Crystal are still 10 full days.
---
An no i dont buy this for 40g from the trading post.
---
Shit, that's a bit easier than what I actually had set up!
---
Anyone else recall the quotes from Chef Robertus in LS2?
---
&gt;"For the millionth time, there are no culinary applications for bloodstone dust. None."  
---
&gt;"No good can come from feeding it to living beings."
---
Lol i play healer firebrand with mace/shield+Staff at high tier fractals.  
---
It's good weapon set for a healer, but garbage for damage dealer, because mace 1 heals, mace 2 apply regen, mace 3 apply protection+aegis, it's supportive weapon, so you must play a support.
---
Its not strange, you see it that way because I dont have mentality of black and with nothing inbetween. No timegate means you control when and what you do. With time gates you lost that choice. You like it and say its fine, therefore I call it selfish. You endorse the solution that gives nothing to you objectively, but removes choice from others.
---
Watch out, gamers don’t like real world politics in their Entertainment
---
I don't understand your point. The skyscale release was the 14th, there wasn't any update on the skyscale since this day and we can even use it on the last map. So ? The timegate doesn't do anything to anet, doesn't change any of the crunch. The mount is there since the update but not available on all maps since today. And it doesn't looks buggy. So let us rush the content if we like it this way.
---
Hush ^^; Orr could have been made by Zaithan's barf when crahslanding (supposedly at that time all dragons were gorged with magic as the races falled to stop them)
---
Yeah he said that but thats not the part you quoted. You said they should ban him just for sharing blacklisted IP.
---
Hi
---
What does PSA means within some title ? Can't find smth relevant on Google
---
This is just a mount, why does it cost so much time and currency except from gold? Would have crafted aurora ten times more happier and get a LEGENDARY item than getting the skyscale, an *ordinary* mount which isn't even special and just fills some niche?
---
I regret wasting my time on the collections now...
---
Thank you for your post, it summarised all of my thougts :)
---
I love Anet and the amazing world they created, that i can proudly call my second home, to bits!
---
Any other company would have shut down GW1 a long time ago, but it's still standing strong as i see lots os players there everyday.
---
They give us an amazing story filled with lore that can be compared to Tolkien.
---
Yet People choose to bash, and really bash them, I've seen some hurtfull comments in regards to this :( over a mount...
---
You make no sense and lack of understanding of this whole timegate debate shows in first two sentences. I suggest you give a little more thought to your ramlings and try again later.
---
Exactly! Like Batman from the arkham games. He doesnt kill thugs he just breaks most of thier bones
---
Praise Hunkleberi!

---
&gt; Hello all,
---
&gt;
---
&gt;I put together a quick change to the API to allow some more fine-tuned control over sharing API keys a few weeks ago, and I had a chance to deploy it today. I have added an endpoint for creating what I'm calling "subtokens". 
---
&gt;# Recent API Updates
---
&gt;---
---
&gt;First, here is the change in list format:
---
&gt;* Added the `/v2/createsubtoken` endpoint
---
&gt;# Subtokens
---
&gt;As a warning: this change's uses are niche.
---
&gt;A subtoken is a special API key that can be used anywhere a normal API key can be used. It is simply a wrapper around a regular API key with reduced permissions. It can be created by accessing `/v2/createsubtoken` with several options:
---
&gt;* Subset of permissions (e.g. account, inventories)
---
&gt;* Expire time
---
&gt;* List of urls that can be accessed (optional: if no urls are provided, then all urls are allowed)
---
&gt;Here is an example that shows the full functionality:
---
&gt;```
---
&gt;GET https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/createsubtoken?permissions=account

---
&gt;The request will be rejected if:
---
&gt;* The reduced permissions do not meet the permission requirements of the endpoint
---
&gt;* The subtoken time is expired
---
&gt;* The request url does not match the restricted url set (unless there are no url restrictions)
---
&gt;# Subtoken uses
---
&gt;As I admitted earlier, there aren't a huge amount of uses for a subtoken. Here are the two use-cases I considered while making this change:
---
&gt;First and foremost, subtokens lets an app (App 1) accept &amp; store an API key from a player and then pass that API key on to another app (App 2) with more control over what App 2 can do with the player's key.
---
&gt;The other case is for savvy users who want more control over what they share with their API key. They can use the endpoint to generate subtokens to hand over to apps with, e.g. expire times or restrictions to certain character endpoints.
---
&gt;I'd love to hear thoughts and feedback for this change, as well as any bug reports.
---
&gt;Thanks!

How to get your Skyscale in just 50 days!
---
Yeah but it *needs* that blending. Right now it just looks terrible and out of place. Something needs to be done regardless though.
---
Disable contextual spacebar in options, mount section
---
Hey there, I took the freedom to change some things in your build...
---
http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vNAQJATRnE8Cl8itCCOsAs8il8AbJAUAWbPhglQGIP+ef7vFsYC-jBCBwABeAAp0FIRJoRlfAuAAJM/hT9Hs7PQKg8UGB-e
---
#1 my go to in any build of mine is pairing a range weapon(which are usually without cleave dmg and have projectiles) with a heavy cleave dmg weapon without projectiles.
---
Axe/axe IMHO is very clunky since skill 5 forces you to stand still, which is a huge disadvantage in open world.
---
#2 your first two choices in the soulbeast line require boons from other players to work, because without your own source of quickness it's sorta pointless. So I invested the first two traits into something which will be always useful to you.
---
#3 skills, I swapped the heal so you now have really got over time condi cleanse, never fails to help in open world.
---
Vulture stance works like a charm with the second trait in soulbeast, some additional healing is always nice and it will also give you more might.
---
#4 when it comes to pets, you are good to go IMO, the birb with Great sword will make you super fast in open world during fights, like when you start against a champion but realise you are not up to the chance there is an easy escape.
---
You could swap the wolf for a bear type for some extra healing and invulnerability
---
#5 food, I swapped it for cheaper/more cost efficient stuff, but TBH I barely ever use food.
---
I hope this helps you to a nice build and fun times in gw2 (:
---
The pull was outrageously unreliable, though. I don't know if I ever saw it pull an enemy back the full distance with me.
---
Silky Sand tho
---
So we go to Cantha and it turns out that _Cantha is DSD_ - the islands make up DSD's sleeping body, and Kanaxai was her champion.
---
Skins should be prestigious, not functionality. (Although if your monetisation system is built on selling the skins in the cash shop ... But then again, to use skins from the cash shop, you first need to unlock the mount ...)
---
But hey, if I need to decide between wasting tons of my time doing shit I don't want to do and not having the mount ... no mount it is. I lived without the WvW mount, and I really shouldn't have bothered with the beetle either.
---
Pretty much a genocide against centaurs, harpies, and ogres. Yeah.
---
Ripe ground for one of those “is this a pigeon?” memes I think, I’m just too lazy to make one.
---
That unfortunately did not work. Thanks for the suggestion though
---
Also all the essences of luck (orange and yellow glory thingys) you can consume to permanently increase magic find for your account :D
---
Insects typically grow Up quite fast and efficient
---
Why would i be? Aurene took years. yet you want all of her now? Is she not worth all the love and care everyone put into her?
---
I dont like aurene. You can have her and all the story, enjoy.
---
How are you going to list the easiest HoT ones and then list rare hardly fought ones like Abominations for PoF?
---
A Djinn is not going to mess up someone like Hylek Archers does new players, a Forged Forerunner does not mess up new players like a Mordrem Sniper does, and the Awakened Ravager is easier than those easy animals you listed from HoT since all you have to do for the Ravager is walk around in random uncoordinated directions to avoid his "difficult skills."
---
PoF enemies hit like wet noodles compared to how hard HoT enemies hit. Having more skills doesn't make an enemy harder, and comparing individual enemies to enemies designed to be a challenge in a group is not fair at all. A pack of Forged is far easier than a pack of Mordrem in nearly every case. A Verdant Brink supply camp is a much harder event for new player than some of the "harder" stuff in PoF.
---
I've been guiding lots new players through the game and its expansions these past two months since I've been back. None of them want to go to HoT, they would all rather go to PoF so they don't have to struggle. Even legendary bounty bosses are easier for them than venturing through Chak infested lands.
---
There was extensive preview on the mount... so you pretty much knew already it was an "ordinary" mount. Why did you then bother with the collection in the first place?
---
I swear, anets friendliness towards its community in terms of keeping grind to a minimum and everything achievable by everyone has created these horrible "GIMMEGIMMEGIMME" monsters that just are never satisfied.
---
This is an MMORPG for pete's sake. Outside of anets world, that means: work, dedication, grind, and git-gud. Well, and p2w or subfee.
---
Be glad anet offers you a really - REALLY - casual friendly version of it and stop complaining just because you dont insta-unlock everything on logging in.
---
Acquiris Quodcumquae Rapis.
---
But dude, don't you wanna feel the sense of pride and accomplishment for unlocking this amazingly useless skyscale?
---
Maybe anet should also have told you to breathe in? And out... and in.... and out.
---
So I could buy superior griffon for 250g *and* spend my currency+ VM for shipments? Sounds like better deal.
---
You get the collection item from the daoly chest thingy that pops over your minimap
---
I have 50-100 of most of them...
---
It’s hard for those with breathing problems
---
At least it helps me, who has yet to get past the scale collection  :)
---
You mean the ones that can also be crafted, the ones that are sellable on the TP or the ones were both works? I can't tell.
---
Random Guy at Anet: Maybe we could make engaging content instead of either of those?
---
The rest of Anet: *Laughter*
---
I really love Lost Precipice, it has so much detail in it and the waterfall/nature area in the corner is so chill. I also like how the giant crystal grows bigger as your guild level increases.
---
Small tip when your decorating but the right side building area can be great for making rooms.
---
I don't get it.
---
Do you need kralkatite ore or Ingots?
---
Yeah it's almost like when it's an MMO people expect new content to play through. Otherwise there isn't much of a point of an MMO, is there?  People aren't RuShInG content. They're going at whatever pace pleases them and for some that is very fast and for others it is very slow. And its almost like you'll never be able to please everybody but when the resounding response of a community is that they don't like something re: timegates, then maybe the creators should listen to the community.   
---
Because a MMO is nothing without a community behind it.
---
Ähm, nearly all other MMOs has more grind as far as i know and all grind in GW2 a optional
---
Yes exactly, makes a lot more sense xD
---
Yea, that feels frustrating
---
\**Forcefully throws the ball straight in the head of my baby skyscale*\*
---
I love this weirdo community.
---
MMO games cant stay on a healthy level if they ONLY cater to a single crowd of players. You need easily accessible content and you need time committed content. Taking away the long term rewards will only leave the players that come back for a week on lws releases. Are you sure thats enough to keep GW2 running? I'm pretty sure its not.
---
It's clearly not too expensive
---
There are hints that help for some, but yea the vast majority are very hidden. Also, it feels like the yellow item name wont show from a short distance. This means you can't just hold alt and see them from far away
---
I understand being pissed about the time gate, but this is absolutely fine, it's actually a good way to gate people, going and playing the content.
---
Meanwhile maps that are empty for weeks on end never close..
---
He means the scale collection items, not the borrowable mounts
---
Now I get why on day 1 on 9 players on GW2 Efficiency had unlocked Gatescale.
---
(sigh)
---
For character or account?
---
An Application programming interface or API for short is a software that exposes Data outside of their usual use-case. An API has different endpoints for different type of operations usually used for just exposing Data to read them but it is also used to write data in other applications.
---
In GW2s case it exposes certain data like your characters, WvW stats, PvP, wardrobe, items, map information and [a lot more](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:Main). With those endpoints 3rd Party developers like gw2efficiency can query those endpoints and gather the data and with the help auf the API Key specifically for your account you can authorize them to make requests to restricted parts of the API to, for example, request your characters or your inventory and display them.
---
An API is usually returning some format that is easily processed and transmitted like XML or JSON.
---
Another example is TheTVDB or TheMovieDB which provides APIs to pull data for TV-Shows or Movies to parse them into some software like media servers or even applications that rename files.
---
As what this update changes has u/Mlakuss/ already explained.
---
&gt; More food for thought: Is this mirror world what it means for the Mursaat to be "out of phase" with Tyria? And being ascended is why we can see and fight them?
---
Except we've never seen or fought a single Mursaat in gw2 :\
---
I keep 1000 spares around for this kind of occasion ...
---
I'm pretty sure the entire point of that part of the story was to show the commander even "lesser races" had their own forms of social structures and architecture, and were every bit capable of joining the playable races in the war against the dragons.
---
inb4 they make wing 7 require Skyscale
---
Lucky ***** xD. Can I have some please ? :3
---
pretty sure it's account, so yeah. not really an option
---
you get 50-100 per reward track, for about 6h of playing (with boosters), right? in most maps there are farming routes that take 10-20 minutes for 30-50 currency daily. so I don't see how reward tracks can be considered faster, unless you already reached your daily gathering cap of the currencies and still have time to play for several hours.
---
Oh so that conversion is gated daily too?  Makes sense but kinda tedious
---
The purchase limits of these materials are per character‽ That's neat. I always just assumed they were per account.
---
Small reminder: For those that want to quickly max out their Skyscale masteries, getting gold rank on POF and Season 4 adventures is great for this.
---
Ah yup. that's fair!
---
What I mean by "things like this" is content like this that leaves people frustrated or disappointed where the expectations did not line up with the actual implementation, something I think was an issue with anet's advertising than anything else.
---
We've had the Druid backpack and Aurora in the past, although I don't believe it was as hyped as this mount so perhaps not as much of a comparison as I would like hah.
---
With the exception of Istan that gives 250 yes. It is by no means faster though, just much more fun than heart farming with alts/node gathering
---
Praise Susan!
---
Gameshow guests are masochists for game.
---
Thanks !
---
wat crystal, the throne? or something in that back right corner?
---
Do not try to complete Sandswept Isles map, it gives only 5 per rather huge map completion. Jahai Buffs and Dragonfall 25, do not remember other maps.
---
... I mean literally as soon as aurene died the community was like "yea, joko magic".. so Id really hope they had more long term plans..
---
I guess they might not have known that originally when she ate joko tho...
---
I'd say that this (something similar to what Shaman posted) would be fine if it'd only appear after you enter the map
---
They're in the order they're introduced in the story, starting at the bottom.
---
First i think the Skyscale collection is the best from all mounts.
---
And no 250 is not too much. It's nothing.
---
I'm a casual player and have more than 1000 in my bank.
---
What for? Making suggestions?
---
Depends on the map. Run the metas, complete heart quests and do the dailies. 
---
Most maps involve farming nodes a bit too.
---
You could exchange it for volatile magic, so people were recommended to use them up iirc
---
Well his name is Brandon Stark, Bran is just shortened so the pun works better when you go off his actual name.
---
I see a distinct lack of Sylvari icons. Great work though, they look great
---
Omg stop crying. Even I as a casual player have more than 1000 of each LS4 currency in my bank.
---
We are talking about gw2 Endcontent here. 250 is not that much
---
My problem was needing 16-17k for the complete set of weapons... That took a very long time. I ended up just farming the heart because I didnt get into the istan farm when it was hot
---
They can't handle the sorrow.
---
I'm fucking done. I can only play videogames a short time each day because of injuries. I can not physically afford to spend 6 hours a day farming these shitty LS4 map currencies.
---
There are many floating NPCs in the PvP lobby now
---
I'm still surprised that you farmed/bought about 16-17k Powedered Rose Quartz too. I'd probably be driven insane if I did that.
---
For reference, Metabattle's is built on Tanetris' but with more recent content included. I think it breaks things down in a simpler way.
---
(Your [story recap guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide) is also really cool, so thanks for writing it.)
---
Are you using the LFG tool? Do you belong to a guild? I never have trouble doing any content in any zone, and I can't remember ever having to wait two hours for any of that stuff, even fairly recently.
---
"Bags of (blah) gear" are worth more on a level 50-ish character as the salvage materials are worth more from level 50-ish gear. The rest, I believe, is always level 80 so you can just open and salvage it. 
---
The only thing I really check are exotics (orange gear), which I sell if they're worth more than about 50/60 silver.
---
By profession, do you mean crafting or class? "Profession" in GW2 refer's to the character class, technically, so it's not clear. For crafting, pick the two your character uses and just do those - the right one for your armour is most important (tailor, leathercrafter, armorsmith) because there are 6 bits of armour, so it just takes longer. 
---
The daily time-gated stuff is under "ectoplasmic refinement" in the crafting menu and it's worth making one of each if you have the mats as they are useful and can also be sold for high profit dues to scarcity if you need the gold.
---
You are plaing the wrong kind of games.
---
have you already forgotten the collections for the griphon?
---
spoiler alert: you wouldnt have done it in one sitting either...
---
Raids are locked only for those with expansions, HoT/PoF. But you can do dungeons even on free accounts. They can enter a dungeon (Ascalon Catacombs) by themselves at level 30, but can enter into it even on earlier levels when invited by a higher level player.
---
nodes, chests and dailies.
---
Well, they had two choices. Let it be 250 gold again, or let it be 250 different resources that you actually can get by plenty jsut by playing. And they went for resources this time, as 250 gold was quite a lot for many players and having such expense second time would be probably quite bad.
---
So...it is trade off. 
---
Also, it is better than needing like 1500 from single map, as it promotes variety of gameplay over farming one spot endlessly.
---
Legendary trinkets are pretty useless, honestly. I can get dozens of ascended trinkets for a fraction of the effort.
---
I actually just did this yesterday. Didn’t LFG (which you should if you really want it), but popped my Catmander tag and started it solo. During the escort mission two other players joined in, and by the time we fought the boss, we had about 5 people running it. I’ve also been working on Aurora, and have found that just calling something out on the map is usually enough to get people to join. It’ll also be much easier once people tire of Dragonfall, and go back to whatever goals they had last week.
---
New land! N e W l A n D!
---
You only took 155 million fall damage.
---
Invocation Renegade rotation is not that bad to learn - its a very clean and simple loop, which you can find on Snowcrows’ website. It is, however, somewhat dependent on having perfect Quickness/Alacrity uptime to actually execute the rotation as written, with Invo Shiro being slightly easier than Invo Kalla. So it’s harder in practice than on golem. Also yes you will need to be in melee range at least half the time (realistically All the time because you need to cast Unyielding Anguish on the enemy while in shortbow).
---
That being said, it is a condi build AND it has one of the slowest ramp-up times among condi classes, so you will find that it mostly shines only in raids. You can get some excellent results in other pve activities too, but pretty much only on enemies with enough health to stay alive for more than 20 seconds. Raid benchmark numbers don’t give a realistic impression what works well in, say, open world, cause it doesn’t take things like boon uptimes, personal survivability, etc into account.
---
Generally speaking, you’ll have a faster and smoother time playing power classes in dungeons/fractals/open world. The exception is condi classes that are primarily burning damage, e.g. berserker, firebrand, condi engi.
---
Slow helicopter wich takes 5 min to go up ? Is that suppose to be legendary mount ? They changed the speed of Springers so the only way you would use Skyscale would be in the air trying to get up.
---
Oh I see now... Them adding all of these unnecessary and quite ridiculous time gates was to buy Anet time to properly code and test this shit. Makes sense and I commend you for taking the time to beat them to the punch.
---
EXPOSED
---
Leaving Seyda Neen in Morrowind be like that
---
I stood there next to a jinn with mentor icon asked if someone would join, in a about 20-30 minutes got the prompt to switch world's, did that and done the same thing but now death branded meta spawned so unlucky and decided to take quick break and found 2 people next to me and then in about 20 minutes we managed to gather 10ish people
---
I'm pretty sure ANet doesn't want Valve to take a cut from their GW2 sales.
---
&gt; Except for the fact that we're told she has biological children.
---
Going in circles here, see [Parthenogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenogenesis). Or the Virgin Mary if you're into that kind of thing, after all we have a *literal* Crystal Dragon Jesus now.
---
&gt; Chak are flesh and blood, they lay eggs and reproduce just like any other insect, despite their diet. Diet is not a qualificiation for or against something being a species.
---
Okay so magic is perfectly acceptable.
---
&gt; It has direct bearing on the fact that dragon minions and dragon corruption is not reproduction. They are not a species.
---
**IF** two dragon minions had sex and a new dragon minion grew inside one of them, already corrupted even before birth, would that count? 
---
&gt; The same as on Earth.
---
You are contradicting yourself. Chak cannot exist IRL because leyline magic does not exist, thus they cannot be "biological life" as we know it. The food *becomes* the offspring so make sure to explain how that's supposed to work in Chak but not in dragon minions without arbitrarily postulating it.
---
&gt; None of the origin of the discussion was about species, and I never cared about it as the only thing of importance has always been the fact that dragon minions do not reproduce and this is canon lore, stated and restated. Hell, I'm no longer sure that was even relevant to the original discussion that got derailed.
---
**You** postulated a crucial difference between "scions" and "dragon minions" and that only the former's offspring can wield magic outside the ED's domains. You apparently continue to claim a "scion" must have been created through biological sexual reproduction despite us having no actual proof of such: who says Glint even "laid" those eggs as opposed to magically crafting them in something similar to the dragonsblood forge?
---
I agree that dragon minions are incapable of sexual reproduction. However I do not see anything explicitly preventing scions *or* dragon minions from reproducing asexually as per real-life variants of that process. And while I do believe dragon corruption will prevent the development of non-aligned magical abilities I'd say the purification ritual is the crucial component to surpassing that limitation. Whether the generational delay is strict or merely a consequence of the time and dedication necessary to learn new types of magic I'm not sure.
---
**Parthenogenesis**
---
Parthenogenesis (; from the Greek παρθένος, parthenos, 'virgin' + γένεσις, genesis, 'creation') is a natural form of asexual reproduction in which growth and development of embryos occur without fertilization. In animals, parthenogenesis means development of an embryo from an unfertilized egg cell. In plants parthenogenesis is a component process of apomixis.
---
Parthenogenesis occurs naturally in some plants, some invertebrate animal species (including nematodes, water fleas, some scorpions, aphids, some mites, some bees, some Phasmida and parasitic wasps) and a few vertebrates (such as some fish, amphibians, reptiles and very rarely birds).

---
If you only have one level 80 you might find it faster to pop boosters and do some WvW or PvP for the reward tracks after you've done the hearts for the day.
---
mmm, yes the playable race's burden!
---
Use the LFG tool, Some people peruse it, even if they're not in the zone. Talking in a single map when there are people constantly in and out of both maps isn't very efficient. I've always found the combination of talking in map chat, and linking a way point, popping a tag, asking in guild chat and the LFG tool has been effective.
---
1 500 ? Hmm another player told me that the first item isnt bought with shards. That would mean there are 6 items but only 5 are bought with shards ? Or maybe that player was wrong I guess
---
I did the griffon collection in one sitting, where's your god now?
---
But will this party of newbies be able to finish a dungeon? xD
---
Don't have commander tag, haven't bothered with getting it yet, lfg when trying achievement hunt was unsuccessful atleast in my tries, on fractals is a must have and always found group quickly
---
Mentor tag works fine too.
---
Agree to what has been said. Spending gold on a commander tag has proved to be really useful because people have a tendency to flock to it. I've tried the mentor tag sometimes too and it simply doesn't have that effect.
---
Wow! The masteries really do make a difference!
---
It's far easier to unlock your first elite spec in PoF as all of those hero points are able to be soloed.  You can then spend them wherever you want, Soulbeast or Druid.  Then find yourself a HoT hero train later on to unlock the other.
---
With a map guiding you and the required mounts or a mesmer helping you PoF is doable in probably less than 2 hours.
---
It's a bug, m8.
---
I'd rather not open this can of worms in a thread concerning a video game. I play video games as an escape from IRL to enjoy myself.
---
Those are interesting thoughts Op, definitely seem plausible.  Thanks for sharing.
---
Looks like the standards for "EVERYTHING" have reached the all-time low.
---
Will be hard to do themselves but maybe doable, but could be easier if carried/helped by high level characters. Aren't you gonna go with them? :D
---
As they should be.
---
Ty for post. I did the previous maps with another character and was thinking of doing all the stories and completion on this one. Do you know if it's worth doing the stories or should I just do hearts and completion (plus dust off some other alts to do the same)?
---
That won't happen. The people whining are the players who spend hours upon hours grinding everything as fast as possible. They never stop whining.
---
Oh no, I have to play the content to unlock some content that I don't want because griffon is best op mount in the world!
---
Well don't get the skyscale, then! Seriously...
---
There's some Mordremoth in there somewhere...
---
Thanks! If they join, I will certainly try :D
---
Are you living 7 days in the future?
---
Yep most of us are in that boat!   
---
On day one most didn't realize there was the daily reset timegate. Tomorrow is the day and meanwhile do like me and get all the stuff necessary for the saddle if you havent
---
oh cool, all the currencies that have been building up in my storage from home instance will have a purpose.
---
I think a lot of people would have had a load expecting a legendary trinket
---
Her head is so oversized normally I had to check the bobble, and it's honestly not that different LOL
---
But I need 1500 out of my 2800 volatile magic for the saddle. That leaves me enough to buy *one* portal scroll
---
 So which item we need to skip the JPs, the other locations and the bosses:
---
"extra-pungent skyscale"
---
or
---
"Smell-Enhancing Culture"
---
the post is a little confusing about it.
---
But I do achievement hunts daily along side popular Metas, should I be bothered then?
---
Two main possibilities: 
---
* Kralk (and most likely the other EDs too) went mad upon first becoming an Elder Dragon from sheer magical overload or a specific property of "domain-pure" corruption. This is somewhat implied by "Bloodstone Madness" but not confirmed for any magic originating from sources other than that specific Bloodstone. Snaff's description of Kralk's mind in Edge of Destiny also somewhat matches the description of the Torment.
---
* Kralk always was uncaring, callous or downright cartoon evil with only a few redeeming points (love for Glint mainly) but absorbing the magic of Zhaitan, Mordremoth and Balthazar made him go into an omnicidal rage. This version does not absolve him from previous actions but explains why he suddenly sought to outright destroy everything including the Mists after sitting idle for so long.
---
Pretty sure Mordremoth was just a douche though.
---
Well, lorewise, any profession can wield any weapon. There is no reason not to and he has seen NPCs using a weapon that gamewise isn't allowed by their profession. ^^did ^^I ^^ruin ^^the ^^joke ^^of ^^the ^^post?
---
Try to keep in mind it's optional and something to do between content updates... and breathe deeply
---
Doing content is not running content. If you're going to be the guy who pops the tag, you're going to want to be willing to communicate and run things and really know the content. Sometimes I do that, sometimes it's just too much and I prefer to follow a tag. Just doing something doesn't make you need a tag, if you're not actually running that content, you know as in commanding it.
---
I was going to say but forgot earlier, if you are doing the achievements the first week or two when a new story comes out, obviously the wait will be longer, because people are still enthralled with the new zone, but the pendulum swings back fast enough.
---
Actually, I kind of like this simile -- calling the Skyscale a legendary(ish) mount. As far as actual gameplay goes, the strongest gear can be achieved from Ascended, analogous to the most directly useful mount being griffon. The step to legendary gear requires \*alot\* of work relative to the gain (swapping stats/sigils), so the main reason we'd do it is for the skin, social status, and enjoyment of collecting. I'm slowly working my way through the Skyscale stuff for exactly those three reasons, not because it's an objectively faster/better mount.
---
I've seen many players, myself included, run around open world using a sub-optimal weapon for their class/build just because they have the cool-looking legendary skin. Is 1H sword an optimal weapon for my power-boon soulbeast? Perhaps not, but that's the legendary I have so that's what I use sometimes. Will Skyscale necessarily get me from point A to point B the fastest? Probably not, but I certainly look forward to hovering my way around Lion's Arch.
---
I do realize the skyscale is still less cost and effort than a piece of legendary anything. But it is the final mount of PoF and this season of LW (consequently, perhaps the last mount ever?). Putting in some grinding on each of the previous maps is almost a kind of closure. That being said, I do wish we could have known the full requirements from the beginning (or even pre-episode), so we could have started saving currencies, converting quartz, and just mentally prepping for a long journey.
---
I must apologize for not being but hurt like the vocal minority, how dare I. Imagine being ok with playing the game for a week to unlock something.
---
Anet shills out in full force today, I see
---
Fair enough, thank you very much for the tips!
---
You can console yourself that at least in GW2 you don't have to kill them... if you want to have a go at genocide, try Black Desert Online...
---
O(G)RLY?
---
'Everyone with a different opinion is a shill!!1!1!'
---
Anet being too good for this community...
---
Farming in PvP is never the right choice.
---
jumping ... and falling.
---
My point is, we tend to be hypocrites, we have a general tendency to nit pick things we wanna be mad about and the Skyscale time gate is a perfect example.
---
Just to be super clear here, I am the kind of player that will not sleep day 1 until I unlocked the mount, yet I still don't get mad about the time gate, its not a big deal.
---
That's the whole idea with many of these GW2 topics, starting from that retarded poison mushroom in VB that everyone cried about, until the Skyscale time gate, everyone wants the shiny without the time commitment and yeah I get it, its a forced time gate to make people stick around the game but at the end of the day you are not locked out of a zone just because you can't unlock the Skyscale.
---
Every single mmo has time gates when it comes to unlocking unique things and no other gaming community is as triggered when it happens and I will end by saying that ideally it would be a better design putting this behind some hard content or find other alternatives to make people stick with the game but we are talking about GW2 here, we know that ain't gonna happen so this is the best alternative for them with the resources they got.
---
It sounds like some issue with the sound settings, maybe try movine or renaming the [local.dat](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Local.dat) file and see if that fixes it? Otherwise many of the other sound issues would cause no sound at all ([like this issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8nwtd4/help_im_getting_no_sound_from_the_game/e41re6n/)). Could also troubleshoot the audio device and make sure that it's set as the default audio output device though based on what you've said it sounds like your audio is working properly for everything else.
---
Do you really think people agree with you, lol? Do you think your opinion is worth more than mine, when I am right?
---
I am not talking about any achievement. I am talking about the fact that you can use the volatile magic to get quite high and quite far, as opposed to not using them.
---
It is quite irrelevant if you want it or not. You made a point that Skyscale is useless since there are other mounts that can do similar things, so I pointed out that Aurora is just as useless with that logic.
---
I'am amaze after reading this, the amount of people who didn't consider the possibility of an aurora 2.0 (not talking about coalescence but a new one) and did not start stockpiling them since the beginning. I would dare to say this was inevitable.
---
Yes, it did! Makes playing way more comfortable and discourages me from getting Skyscale even more!
---
Is 4.5 months months new enough to you? By the time I was done with the story content I pretty much had the gold for the griffon.
---
it is meant as a boost, not as a sole source.
---
plenty of ways to get all the currencies easily.
---
They are making glider SKINS. They are not making new ways of using the gliders. A new mount has a new set of skills and new usage. It is not comparable in the slightest.
---
I use them all too, not roller though, I crash into everything.
---
Ofcourse? It's a mount
---
Now it make sense why the first merchant sells other map currency’s for VMagic
---
35g is barely more than the jackal lol
---
This, I ddidn't care about any of the LWS map rewards but there was always something gnawing in the back of my mind "what if", boy am I glad I didn't listen haha..ha..
---
You're trying too hard, good trolls are more subtle.
---
Yeah probably. If you want to, you can always find something to complain about
---
I agree with him
---
I mean, you're entitled to your opinion, but I'll just say I agree with them too. Like I personally don't really have that much use for a legendary accessory since I can just do the Bitterfrost/other season map farm, spend other forms of currency (like fractals), or just use a converter on my bloodstone pieces and just get most any stat I'm lacking. And that's not even counting all the random ascended accessories I have in my bank and on my mule toon.
---
[this](https://i.imgur.com/0HtTurA.png)
---
i didn’t say that though?? the currency requirement was there from the beginning obviously.
---
Diety...
---
they said there will be a daily chest at the end of these rifts (or when you follow the magic orbs) I am not expecting much, but have gotten one yet?
---
&gt; What is your oppinion ? Should it be 250 or would you lower it ?
---
The only problem I see is what you need and not how much. So far, everything you got from an episode or you needed to acquire was either from the living world, the core game or the connected expansion.
---
Having to gather other living world episode currencies that you are not able to get actively locks you out of being able to get the mount at all.
---
This is getting worse if the main focus of this episode is the mount. In comparison this would be like using HoT currency for the beetle. For Veterans and players who buy the package this isn't a problem but everyone who don't have the those episode you actively say that they need to buy all of those episodes to get the main feature of another.
---
As for the amount, 250 are IMO okay. It is not that much and you get them pretty quickly if you are active on those maps or invest into PvP or WvW reward tracks.
---
Which means, it gives you an incentive to go back to those Maps and be active which profits those players who are playing the map for the first time.
---
&gt; mount wich is suppose to be worst then Griff
---
Nope, Skyscale is not worse than the Griffon, each mount has their own niche in which they operate. The Griffon is a fast mount but needs a high starting point, the skyscale is not that fast but could get you to this high point with the mastery to be able to jump up when they latched on to a surface.
---
Is \[Spiritwood Plank\] a timegate? 🤔
---
Wow, that's quality shitpost
---
Skyscale: ***performs a round house kick on said ball like it's the movie 'Shaolin soccer.'***
---
That's because you've exhausted the content you personally find fun for yourself. Other players having a good time continuing to take in all sorts of other content available without worrying about the end reward and their "worth." The only worthwhile content to do is that you find fun, if you have ran out of fun content for yourself you can take a healthy break from the game and come back when either new content is added or you've recovered from your self-imposed grinding fatigue.
---
&gt; Because magic can shapeshift folks. Because the Shadowstone / Krait Oil fundamentally altered something about the Commander's capability to withstand magic.
---
Or because Zommoros is messing with us.
---
&gt; The first four raids were relevant directly to the current storyline (Season 3)
---
Was BotP really "relevant" though? It tied up a loose end from GW1 and *might* have been foreshadowing for PoF (the Forgotten prisoner) but I'm not sure we gained anything over the ending state of GW1 when it comes to LS3Ep6.
---
In fact they kinda retconned all of it to become meaningless in Head of the Snake anyway and the massive White Mantle presence was just as baffling once first discovered in the Forsaken Thicket as it was in Ep1+4.
---
Hall of Chains teased Gwen, seemingly eliminated the Reapers (which otherwise might have become relevant in dealing with Joko or Mists-Kralk, would Dhuum stand a chance against either of those?) and from a more general perspective brought back another god realm for nostalgia. They retroactively made it slightly more relevant by filling the DF Underworld chunk with Dhuum-themed monsters although I do question the absence of Desmina.
---
Mythwright is not done yet but could be a spinoff/continuation of the Anomaly side lore. Could become relevant to the post-LS4 lore overall because apparently the Mythwright Cauldron can fundamentally mess with life, souls or similar concepts. However I don't expect any direct involvement, most likely they'll draw parallels to it at some point and that'll be it.
---
Thanks, now neither can I
---
tyvm for the info!
---
How did they have "two choices"? They are the making the damn game, they can make it cost whatever they wanted. This is not an either or situation. 
---
I don't even much if issue with currency acquirement but acting they just had to this or it cost 250 gold is ridiculous.
---
So basically a chinese game ? Will they wave before teleporting out ? :D
---
Are these gathering nodes per char or per acc?
---
What Arkham doesn't know, is that those centres were owned by Wayne Corporation. Batman gotta make money somehow!
---
they are... but their cuteness tend to be reduced the more they are.
---
1 pocket raptor : cute
---
150 pocket raptors (aka a normal group of pocket raptor) : ugly
---
have you considered adding a specialized gear template for harvesting tools? like a unique simple window with a new hotkey to toggle between saved sets? that way we could save one with normal tools and one with endless ones and swap them with a single hotkey or by opening and selecting, clicking load. would need to consider shared inventory slots of course, as that is probably where most people keep their endless tools if they plan on swapping them frequently.
---
just a thought I had a while ago when I once again forgot to swap out my tools :)
---
And people were complaining it can't go high enough, pfft
---
Is turning 18 a timegate?
---
I assume we will start with something unrelated to the dragons (like trying to find help for Taimi for example) that will lead into the next big bad towards the end of the season and into the next xpac, similar to season 3. The way this entire arc ended is the perfect opportunity to scale down the stakes for a bit before ramping up again.
---
they ended the LS3 with a
---
I'm just glad that those home instance nodes exist, so I don't have to farm the maps.
---
U need for the last Collection 250 of each map currenice. What is the same to Aurora with out the mats
---
Yes, I imagined the term 'lesser races' was used in the same way as we use 'less developed countries'.
---
Pocket raptors will each say "oof"
---
I hope it's gonna be Baroosh!
---
a smiling baby can be bad news
---
I know, the russian names break the immersion, should have been Chinese \s
---
Same. We could have guessed but i spent 7 days doing other things instead
---
For people like me who can only play in one long burst day once in awhile, it sucks. Let people be unhappy about the timegate.
---
Okay. Well I have a character full of ascended items so as a raider that's off the table.
---
/r/guildrecruitment might be an option.
---
Pocket raptors. Cute but highly carnivorous and deadly. They have killed more pact soldiers and commanders than all of the elder dragons combined
---
Not really, you can get infinite height on the gryphon and Anet doesn't seem concerned about fixing that. So, no, game wouldn't be broken if Skyscale was allowed unlimited verticality.
---
Can I just kick it instead?
---
Don't worry. You need 250 of all LWS4 currencies
---
There is absolutely nothing at the end besides the mount itself.
---
(This also includes a complete lack of story or dialogue. Also, the Skyscale mount unlock screen uses gryphon icons, because why not? :poggers:)
---
Well yes except it's not a pun or even really any sort of joke. It's the potential basis for a (probably not very good) joke that they never bothered to craft.
---
Glad I could deliver on that account ;)
---
I get what your point is. It seems the rifts didn't appear at core maps until the release, as I've never seen anything like that during my map completing... maybe I might miss them.
---
&gt;ogres actually devolved because of the last Elder Dragon awakening cycle since they which was IIRC the most advanced race in the history of Tyria but mostly were wiped out.
---
you're thinking of the jotun, not the ogres
---
Having finished it, I don't feel like it was worth it in any way, shape, or form. Skyscale doesn't give me anything new in terms of mount capabilities and the actual grind to unlock it was absolutely miserable.
---
Thats a great change!
---
&gt; ogres actually devolved because of the last Elder Dragon awakening cycle since they which was IIRC the most advanced race in the history of Tyria but mostly were wiped out.
---
Weren't that the Jotun?
---
Thanks for pointing that out.
---
yes. I corrected that.
---
[Relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/979/)
---
Yeah that's the idea with mounts, they all have their uniqueness... Obviously you'd want the Griffon and Spinger do things the Skyscale cant, just as the Skyscale can do things other mounts can't.
---
Thats the best alternative yet lol
---
If he doesnt join your server, you two wont be able to play the World vs World mode together, for the rest you will be fine.
---
Whatever drugs you are taking, stop it.
---
We kill bandits and elder dragons.
---
This should have been the last collection.
---
I have similar problems with the buildtemplates when I swap from power chrono to support chrono or the other way around. It doesnt swap my legendary weapons properly and sometimes the sigils are also wrong.
---
We only know it starts with an s, so everyone just calls him Steve and Selbbub
---
Not everybody is interested in doing that tho
---
I was mentioning to a friend how I warmed up to the time gating.
---
...
---
Just make it quick. ;\_;
---
Feeling like I'm in kind of a sweet spot - I just hatched the egg and did the initial collections for that and day one of feeding.  I'm already capped on Kourna, Sandswept, Jahai, and Dragonfall currencies, and I can probably get Istan dealt with in a day or two.  I ragequit Thunderhead after burning too much of that map currency on too few weapons, so it's the only one I really have to farm.  It looks like the drop rate is about in line with Jade, so I'll be hitting a friend's home instance, running three characters through the map, and buying from the vendor every day while I work up to that step of the collection.
---
To be fair this one is logical, it's annoying but the primary way to get these currencies should be from playing the appropriate content.
---
Ah fuck there's more after the saddle?
---
Pick one either take my time by making me round around the same map 3 times plus more running around after waiting a day each or drain me of all the currency I have been collecting from playing the LS maps and farming my home instance. Because in this case the results of your investment is a hybrid of Griffon and Springer that can do both but only halfheartedly.
---
there goes my theory that warclaw was your 'active' mount because you couldnt find a suitable keybind for it and resorted to *shiver* clicking the icon (its what i do)
---
You can get the PvP mist bands and stuff and just use a resetter..
---
You don’t need tons of extra rings/amulets and stuff since they are full stat selectable once reset.
---
The pvp reward track also give some map currency at the end. It's not a full stack, but if you're doing pvp anyway..
---
Your saying that as if it's not the case already, GW2 is king of long-term goals.
---
What is a binding ashes?
---
I don’t like using 3rd party tools and if they keep adding mounts they should redesign the UI to accommodate...
---
This is on them (3rd party tool is nice but when the list goes all the way up the screen.. it’s time the devs do something in game)
---
Same gripe with the dodge+jump macros.. IF they allow the keybinds they should update the options to actually reflect it.
---
Don’t make us use 3rd party tools for standard QoL
---
Except you already opened it in your first post. Which leaves little room for interpreting it any other way.
---
"They better live the way we live. Otherwise they'll never be worth as much as we are."
---
I mean it's not like "civilized countries" kill less people. Or that we have superior morals. It's specifically the "advancing and incorporating new technology" that currently kills our whole planet. Not the primitive tribes.
---
A few days ago, I said I'd do whatever it took, I just want that skyscale. But 250 of each of the six map currencies...?
---
...uh...
---
I see now I should not have said that.
---
Thank you very much 😄
---
At any point during those two hours did you ever consider using the tool available to look for other people interested in doing it or did you sit around waiting for someone else to organise it for you?
---
This is what I've constantly been feeling regarding nearly every heart about centaurs.
---
Good for you.  It's made me want to uninstall, but sunk cost fallacy is a powerful thing isn't it?
---
&gt; What do you suppose is fair non-aggressive treatment of a lesser race hellbent on killing anything that isn't their own due to their religion?
---
Except this isn't true for any of the "lesser" races in GW2. And could be said of many factions of the "superior" races just as well. And some of the most advanced are the most evil ones. Like the Inquest.
---
The argument isn't that there are evil factions in the game. Of course there are. But that deeming other intelligent races as worth less, just because they have a different way of life.
---
🙄
---
The only reaction I have to this post.
---
I was the one trying to organise, asked on map chat if people could help with it, put on mentor tag so people could locate me, I wasn't there just sitting and hoping
---
neither of these traits "bleeds" you in any way. if you engage higher level mobs be prepared to either get a beating or use your active defenses.
---
Yes.
---
what are the currencies your need? I blew through lw4 not paying much attention to the maps themselves.
---
istan track gives straight 250 kralkatite ore
---
Which does not have a bleed.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Burning_Precision
---
What does burning precision have to do with bleeding you to death?
---
At this low rank I'd suggest to go far and just stay there, hold it for as long as possible. Enemies won't stop running up to you and if you're skilled enough, you destroy them over and over again. If you can't do this, you might not be as good a player as you think. (I'm a Gold3 / Plat1 player)
---
Map chat isn’t going to do much because it only addresses people in that specific instance of that map who have it turned on. 
---
LFG tool is the place to go. Guilds are also a great source of players to help out.
---
Me right now: Here, have your skyscale food, you impatient person, and thanks for all the easy gold.
---
Do you have a build part under "legendary" tab in templates?
---
I mean, it was pretty easy to guess. Most people were expecting some sort of legendary trinket anyway, or *something* that would require map currencies. And once the episode got here, and it became obvious that the skyscale was a long, timegated grind, that should have set your alarm bells ringing immediately.
---
I've been prepping for this lightly for over a month now, and heavily for the past few days (ever since the skyscale quest's nature became obvious). Anyone who actually paid attention should have everything they need, or close to it.
---
*That's how mafia works.*
---
I don't think I'll have enough karma... what's the best way to farm it?
---
I feel like it's worth it. I'm having a really good time doing all this -- it's something to motivate me, something to focus on, and it's taken me back through some older content that I haven't done in a while.
---
I don't even care if I rarely use the skyscale itself, the journey has been fun!
---
&gt; U need 35 gold, 500 trade contracts, 250 of every LS4 map currency and 1500 volatile magic
---
Seems like I will ride him without a saddle then. ¯\\\_(ヅ)_/¯
---
Does it make sense to look for a partner?
---
Could you find a good partner in lfg-tool for spvp?

Thx for information.

---
Each location of rift in Jahai bluffs gives 5 mistonium for completion, once per day. an easy 25.  
---
The corsair heart in istan is arguably one of the easiest. Barely even requires combat. Beat up corsairs (either drunk or brawling), dump water on the sleeping ones. i farmed all three of the istan hearts for a few days on all 10 of my characters to get the 8.5k kralkite needed for a full set of stellar weapons. Champions dawn is the most annoying, but you can fetch food from the central spire and unlock those cages at the same time to get a good bit of that heart done. Running over food while mounted will auto pick it up. Give a few bits to villagers to finish off heart progress - most of my characters still have dozen of food left over.  
---
Kourna - every chest in the zone, not just the supply caches, give a guaranteed inscribed shard. Most are once per character daily, but the meta chests will reset every cycle you participate, which works out as 10 or so shards. this map has a full 5 hearts, making it one of the best to farm - all of them progress pretty easily and quickly, especially the two frontier ones which will be filled pretty much just from doing a scarab event within their domain (which are basically always up now that this map is relatively abandoned). Most beetle walls have a couple of chests behind them for 2 extra shards.  
---
each character in thunderhead can get the rewards from each meta event daily, so you can get an extra 120 brandballs from that if you're really that devoted. besides that, each lost chest gives one brandball per day (account, not character), and doing the treasure tomb daily gets you at least 5. the hidden chests unfortunately only have a chance to give more :(  
---
Map completion in thunderhead and jahai (and istan, i think) will also give you 25 of the respective currency.
---
For the items / collections you can use the wiki :)
---
For crafting purposes: gw2efficiency.com can help you with listing all needed crafting steps and even collecting base resources
---
Thank you bro
---
Druid backpack is a fair comparison, though I think Skyscale is a lot more fun because the Druid backpack required you to constantly do the same stuff on the same map for days on end. At least Skyscale is varied and takes you to many different places!
---
This doesn't even remotely compare to Aurora, though -- or to any legendary, for that matter. It's more like the precursor collections.
---
And why should they have been upfront about it? Spoiling quests before they're available spoils half the fun! You're not supposed to be able to prep for it ahead of time. I *did*, because I expected another Aurora-like thing, but I certainly never felt pressured or forced to do so -- I was just bored and wanted something to anticipate. If they wanted you to be able to prep for it so you can get it super fast, they wouldn't have made the whole thing a giant long quest in the first place!
---
To add to this complaint, why are there only 2 genders to choose from? That's so harming for the minorities. Why must these games be so opressive? It mus've been programmed by white males only! &gt;:(
---
^((This is not meant seriously))
---
It's not really everything though is it
---
People need a macro to perform an action that requires pressing two buttons at the same time??? (dodgejump)
---
I don't get why finishing Kourna only gives 5.
---
To be fair it is a very end-game-ish mount like the Griffon would be and you can compare part of the collections to what it would take to do a Gen 1/Gen 2 (the ones that still had collections) legendary weapons. And as you wouldn't really expect to be able to completely finish a legendary after only 1 month of playing I would argue that this mount was not designed so that rather new players could get it quickly without breaking a sweat.
---
most are 25 a day. You can do a single location multiple times (even on the same character, if you wait long enough that they respawn, or switch maps) but after mining out 25 nodes, every node on the map despawns until next daily reset.  
---
Istan i think is the exception. You can harvest every meteor that falls.
---
&gt; “Blah blah stand around and hit this toe for 20min”.... (no thanks) So I just go play PvP or log out and do something real life with the kiddo’s.
---
If it makes you feel any better, most of the events in LS4 are quite well designed. Some *are* a little long, but there's nothing similar to Teq is its longliness.
---
You gave yourself the middle finger by choosing to spend your currency right before the last episode of the season rolled around. Don't blame ANet for your poor foresight.
---
I *do* sympathize a bit, though, because getting the Requiem armor was already a Mistonium farm annoyance, so I agree that it's a bit irritating for people who already went through that to have to do it again for something else.
---
flax in VB, wood in malchor's, end of a JP, permanent iron/platinum nodes.

Who has time to breathe. Between feeding my hatchling and complaining on reddit it's all i can do to remember to have my heart pulse every couple of seconds.

a good duo can rise much easier, yes. It's also a lot more fun playing with a friend + teamspeak. I guess you could find duo partners by joining a PvP oriented guild or by just asking in the chat.

GS or Riot.
---
Doing hears is a good way, and events. I actually think I made more karma than I lost while I farmed for the Requiem armour
---
but you think the same. Outherwhise you would have not question the accuracy ;) The percentage does not have to be accurate and in no way, shape or form i could have any knowledge of it. But sometimes you just throw out numbers to make the standpoint clear.
---
Still crying that we didnt get one FeelsBadMan
---
Just for the streamer to bring a few hundred people for two weeks, who then abandon the game as soon as their idol moves along? Unecessary. You can research what that did for Apex Legends.
---
There is not. :(
---
But takes 30 mins to get a stack in istan because hearts give 25.
---
Rather use potions for another currency imo.
---
&gt; IF two dragon minions had sex and a new dragon minion grew inside one of them, already corrupted even before birth, would that count?
---
Wouldn't really matter since that isn't possible.
---
&gt; You are contradicting yourself. Chak cannot exist IRL because leyline magic does not exist, thus they cannot be "biological life" as we know it. The food becomes the offspring so make sure to explain how that's supposed to work in Chak but not in dragon minions without arbitrarily postulating it.
---
Not really contradicting myself to effectively say "one's diet doesn't affect whether they're a species or not; what defines a species is the same as on Earth."
---
Dragon minions do not reproduce. They just corrupt new, pre-existing things (often living beings) into minions.
---
Dragon minions are more akin to the borg from Star Trek, the stroggos from Quake, replicants from Star Gate, the terminators from Terminator, etc. than to any actual species. They're **constructs** ultimately, made from various materials that get forged by magic into a specific form.
---
&gt; You postulated a crucial difference between "scions" and "dragon minions" and that only the former's offspring can wield magic outside the ED's domains. You apparently continue to claim a "scion" must have been created through biological sexual reproduction despite us having no actual proof of such: who says Glint even "laid" those eggs as opposed to magically crafting them in something similar to the dragonsblood forge?
---
We do have proof.
---
Branded are not of Kralkatorrik's bloodline.
---
Glint is. As is Aurene and Vlast. Glint is stated by devs to be Kralkatorrik's "biological daughter" and not just a minion he decided to adopt, to name to be his child.
---
What does a bloodline mean? Biological reproduction created Glint, whether it was asexual or with a mate.
---
We do not know how they reproduce, we merely know that Kralkatorrik's bloodline *can* and *have*.
---
But before all this, the discussion was about Kralkatorrik's second domain, which has no bearing on the difference between scion and minion.
---
The way to look at it is whether or not its worth it. A full set of ascended vs a full set of exotics is a rough 8% dps increase. This increase goes down as you upgrades accessories to ascended which is easy and weapons to ascended which is easy (but not as easy as accessories). For normal/casual play, this dps increase will be unnoticable (I tend to benchmark my open world builds by fighting the veteran fire hydras near the temple of kormir in the Crystal Oasis, and a 8% increase (or like 3% with accessories and weapons) might be like 1 or 2 hits in difference, and against trash mobs might be totally unnoticeable.
---
However, where the difference really shines is in group endgame content, where with full buffs/food/pots, the difference between full exotics vs full ascended is nearly 20% IIRC. If you are gearing a class for just open world, especially if you are running a suboptimal stat combination for raids/fractals (like marauders/dire/valkyries gear), getting ascended equipment isn't necessary and shouldn't be done outside of easy to acquire ones such as some accessories, and weapons you can get easy through HoT story (caladbolg), and specialization collection weapons. If you are gearing a character to maybe do raids/fractals, then work towards a set of ascended gear after making sure the stat combination is optimal. Make sure you focus on weapons and accessories first as weapons will give you the highest dps increase and accessories are the easiest to acquire, and then work on armor last.

---
Ok this is some quick math from glancing at the wiki. 
---
* [Kralkatite Ore](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Kralkatite_Ore) **(Domain of Istan)** \- 3x hearts (25) + map Completion (25) = 100 first pass, *75 daily per char* (gather from meteors and do meta for more) 
---
* [Difluorite Crystal](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Difluorite_Crystal) **(Sandswept Isles)** \- 4x hearts (5) + map (5) + meta (5) = 30 first pass, *25 daily per char* (gather and do boss events on each character a day for more)
---
* [Inscribed Shard](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Inscribed_Shard) **(Domain of Kourna)** \- 5x hearts (5) + map (5) = 30 first pass, *25 daily per char* (gather chests and do events for more)
---
* [Lump of Mistonium](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Lump_of_Mistonium) **(Jahai Bluffs)** \- 3x hearts (5) + map (25) = 40 first pass, *15 daily per char* (gather and defeat Djinn, Shatterer, stop recruitment and repel each invasion per char (5 each daily))
---
* [Branded Mass](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Branded_Mass) **(Thunderhead Peaks)** \- 4x hearts (5) + map (25) = 45 first pass, *20 daily per char* (gather, open chests and defeat Wrathbringer and Sulypix (5 per acc, daily))
---
* [Mistborn Mote](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mistborn_Mote) **(Dragonfall)** \- 0 hearts + map (25) = 25 first pass, *0 daily* (gather them and do meta till you drop)  
---
\- The more characters you have on this, the faster you are  
---
\- You can buy 5 of each currency every day in Dragonfall, total 420 VM from the [Traveling Elonian Trader](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Traveling_Elonian_Trader)  
---
\- Click the links above to see more details on where and how to grind these, since they are dependant on playtime and thus aren't included in my calculation  
---
\- I do not have any information that doing the story missions awards map currency and thus haven't included that possibility. If they do and it's a good number somebody would have mentioned it by now. So if they do it's probably marginal and your better off farming these via gathering or doing events. 
---
\-I'm doing this with 5 alts where 1 at most did map completion and I should be able to go 0-250 in 2 days (unsure about Mistborn Mote).  
---
Hope this helped out someone, happy grinding!
---
I honestly question how many actually remember doing the griffon collection that are praising it. Could be they're praising it because they don't remember any annoyances they might have had, or just don't really remember it let alone fondly.
---
As for skyscale having issues with events: unlike the griffon, Skyscale so far has zero group events (hell, only one event as of the fourth collection).
---
And some medium pants that actually work with the Krytan top!
---
I mean, from the horse's mouth, they apparently didn't.
---
If ancient eldritch beings have mothers, that's an origin for ancient eldritch beings. They're not one of 7 billion + individuals. Not exactly a reliable comparison.
---
I wasn't too bothered with the timegates earlier, but I'm a bit annoyed because I have over 700+ bits of map currency I now need to farm, and I expect to be mindnumbingly bored for however long that takes me, especially since I already did those maps for other collections.
---
I'd rather pay an additional 250-500g or whatever to skip this tbh (and let people who want to farm the currencies to farm it).
---
Oh well I guess. I'll find some podcasts over the weekend and get to it.
---
Most profitaple place to park them is next to a TP. But if you don't know how to play the tp game your next choice will be daily reseting notes and chests
---
Zafirah in the corner be like: "wait a minute..."
---
Ascended gear is only "needed" for fractals and raids. Also these 2 activities reward ascended armor aswell. So once you have a first set you can easely do that content and gear other characters with those drops, so you dont need to spend any gold for it. Gear other chars. So that you can play more roles eventually.
---
If you run fractals, having several ascended sets with infusions can be worth it.
---
Being able to quickly and fluidly swap between characters/rolls makes you more flexible in lfg.
---
I personally fully gear one character for each roll in group content. DPS, Condi, Boon support, healer. 
---
In your case, I probably wouldn't invest in more ascended sets just yet. There are many more enjoyable things to work towards, such as the griffon, weapon and armor skins, and so on.
---
i only did that heart once for the title, and never again T_T
---
Meanwhile I can't even unlock the collection as the game disconnects after the cutscene of the final fight 😢
---
If you see people farming the tier 3 aquatic fractal, join it. One clear takes 3 mins, less with good comps and pop some boosters. Upwards of 5k/ run with that. Plus its nice money aswell.
---
Time gates on already long collections boost the Pride and Accomplishment players get, dontchakno?
---
I think Kralk's other domain is the future (thanks to his vision), so by that logic, DSD's is the past, which would work if they're the original mother dragon.
---
this was already posted, but. did not expect anyone to have a need for such thing, how often does one need a teleport? you can get anywhere anyway in matter of seconds.
---
&gt; one's diet doesn't affect whether they're a species or not;
---
&gt; They're constructs ultimately, made from various materials that get forged by magic into a specific form.
---
This is contradictory to me. A population of robots who "eat" metals and silicon, forge them into new parts within their body and then come together to assemble and program new individuals satisfy all requirements other than the "biological organism" part.
---
&gt; Branded are not of Kralkatorrik's bloodline.
---
Are Mordrem Bombers of the Thornheart's bloodline? Are the chestbursting spiders of the Champion Risen Spider's bloodline? What about elementals summoning lesser versions of themselves, oozes physically splitting into two and similar **naturally occurring** creatures which are **not** dragon minions?
---
If you're getting hung up on semantics propose alternative terms which encompass all the fantasy variations real life biologists don't have to deal with, and make sure the devs distinguish between the two if you want to cite them as proof. Unless they explained it in more detail the term "biological daughter" has little meaning to me when it comes to Kralk because so many things shown in-game disqualify him from actually being a biological organism. For example the entire final instance, biology does not work that way.
---
&gt; But before all this, the discussion was about Kralkatorrik's second domain, which has no bearing on the difference between scion and minion.
---
*You* brought the distinction into play to explain why Glint was supposedly bound to the ED domains while Aurene is not.
---
Incidentally if we put everything together from *your* side I don't see that working out either: Glint had free will once before and she was a "biological" daughter, meaning she must have been created completely separate from ED corruption if not before Kralk became an ED in the first place. So how and why should she be bound to Kralk's ED domains in *any* way if her tenure as an ED champion was "just an intermediate phase" rather than her initial, "natural" state of being? Why should the Zephyrite Aspects fall under *either* ED domain as opposed to being pre-ED "crystal dragon species" magic?

---
things we do for "map completition"
---
If we were ascended during One Path Ends, then we wouldn't have needed the Eye of Janthir to reveal Lazarus. The entire basis of the fight's mechanics is that we're not Ascended, and Livia says as much while telling us how to fight Lazarus because we're not Ascended. They went through a **lot** of effort to tell us we're not Ascended in Season 2 and 3.
---
While they have a basis of writing what's cool without thinking of the ramifications of the "cool" deeds, they don't blatantly retcon left and right. Not intentionally at least.
---
If they decide to suddenly make the Commander Ascended, they'll probably relate it to either us going through Glint's Trials in S4, our bond to Aurene, or the whole resurrection deal (like the silliness of why flesh eating beetles laying eggs in the Commander). They can't really relate it to the doppleganger meta since that's purely optional.
---
Is this a shitpost?
---
&gt; It's very easy to miss things in lands you don't go.
---
They must have had a decent amount of traffic in and out of Maguuma though, and a fair amount of communication too while Esthel was in Queensdale.
---
&gt; Because Joko is living and doesn't belong in the Mists but was imprisoned by a god so they couldn't expel him. That was my understanding. They wanted him gone.
---
Wait a lich like Joko counts as "living"??? Anyway I don't mean the circumstances of his immediate escape but rather the solution to dealing with his immortality, or lack thereof. As per GW1 status just feeding him to Dhuum might have been an option and even if that were deemed too dangerous surely the Reapers could have come up with something else had they still been with us at the time. We still had the other Bloodstones too but as you yourself say the ToPK would have been far more convenient.
---
Bubbles
---
It was. One day I decided that I wanted the mount and when I stopped playing late that night I had it unlocked.
---
I love it how people complaining about the skyscale timegating (which anet nerfed) is now considered complaining about effort, while people are literally asking to grind harder and faster. Oh and ofc as if we didn't do shit completely disregarding the long collection. Guess in those minds only waiting around for a long time doing almost nothing is more work and prestige than obtaining something in 1/3rd of that time with dedicated playing and grinding.   
---
Pressing F 3 times a day and waiting around for server reset NOT doing the content is legit work btw :'D
---
It feels a bit like a double standard. How could, say, norn realistically contribute more to the fight against elder dragons than races with basically identical technological progress, eg. ogres, hylek, centaurs or kodan? I'd say dredge are on a tecnological level equal to even charr, with all their machinery.
---
Plus technologically every race is a "lesser race" compared to asura.
---
Oh yea lol BDO aggro everyone in the camp. Aoe them down for one genocide in a single combo
---
Whoops, thanks for catching that typo.

"Can only be crafted once per day"

---
You say that because you have no idea how Steam works.
---
Copypasta from the last 6 times somebody brought this up:
---
--------------
---
It's not going to happen because Steam would require Arenanet to use the Steam microtransations API through Steamworks for gem store sales to those customers. Steam would then take a percentage of all of those transactions.
---
Not a theory. Not debatable. A fact of the Steam licensing structure. https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/microtransactions
---
It's a cool idea but isn't that a bit close to ["I am... this world"](https://youtu.be/GpeLj-fDK-4?t=18)?
---
How do you have so many? This is the 1 currency i seem to have trouble.
---
I main Thief but I use all classes as it helps in sPvP and WvW. You'll perform better in those environments if you know what your opponents are using, Id say.  
---
I say just get a Zerk and Viper set for each armor class. That way, you can easily gear for if you want to try and use other classes. Some others require specialized stats like Diviner and Zehtuka but personally, I put those in the back burner and try some easy to gear classes first.  
---
I try to craft ascended as I try to partake in end game content per class but some classes are harder to justify than others (Looking at you, PvE Scrapper).
---
That's why I always volunteer to kill the boss when I run DS xd
---
Once we had to run around so many circles (bc some other lane were failing at finishing their boss) that I legit got dizzy.
---
&gt; we are speaking of new ppl most of the time and timegating, no? for the griphon you have to to beat PoF, have 250g and have to do the collections. no, new ppl wouldnt do that in one sitting...
---
&gt;and you know what? I, as a "veteran", gathered my Home Instance on a daily basis, did all the colections/achievements on all the LS4 maps that needed the currencies, and I still have more than 250 of each currency.
---
&gt;so am I now "your god" in case of the skyscale?
---
You said people wouldn't have done the griffon in one sitting. Plenty of people, like myself, did. Sure new people prob couldn't. But that wasn't what you originally said. You said the COLLECTION couldn't be done in one sitting. It absolutely can and was. In the case of the skyscale, even as a "veteran" who had everything (gold/mats) necessary to do it in one sitting, you couldn't.
---
&gt; Put Guild Wars 2 on Steam
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; There's a decent chance this will happen eventually
---
It's never, ever going to happen because Steam would require Arenanet to use the Steam microtransations API through Steamworks for gem store sales to those customers. Valve/Steam would then take a percentage of all of those transactions.
---

I hope they would let us farm human kids again.
---
Salvaging is worth it as pretty good source of materials. Selling items on TP one by one is brutally tedious and you will on average get same coin as from the materials (people on market do know the value of items and salvages pretty well, if there would be difference, they would cash it out already).
---
On top of that, the Luck is pretty important as well....it is main way to get better drops throughout the game. Maybe it is just tiny upgrade, but I would say still prety visible one over time. You definitely need it :)
---
Don't sell materials if possible. Just deposit all. If your material storage is full, then yyou might want to do some crafting, at least refine the materials to save on space, or even level up your crafting professions (good to use guides to not waste more than needed). You might be interested in profession to craft your first armor set in ascended quality (light - tailor, medium - leatherworker, heavy - armorsmith) and some professions for ascended weapons. There is no rush for that, but getting ascended is the final goal of your gearing, making you ready for all lvl80 content (and especially fractals). Even though exotic equipment is nice, ascended has good advantages (account bound and not soulbound, slots for infusions, cheap stat changing, top stats).
---
If you have too many of some resources, you can sell them on trading post, but you will need most of them anyways, so that depends on your situation (mostly if you can afford storing them - space might be expensive for new player). Crafting is fun when you have resources  and don't need to spend a lot of gold for them.
---
Istan ore is super easy, farm meteors. Get even 50 per meteor, no limit, just needs the device and upgrades (at least 1, 2, 3 if you are with group).
---
Is there any interesting lore whatsoever that you can get from the Skyscale or the Rifts?
---
Was thinking the same thing, especially a day after the new ep dropped. Her site's usually my #1 go to for achievement guides, especially collections. They've contributed a lot to the community &amp; while I don't know them, I'm glad to see (from 1 of the comments here) that they're okay.
---
Found the salty chrono.
---
Yes, that's the point. There may be a time in which giving Valve that 30% will be worth it. After all, it's only for those customers.
---
Yeah, i get it. I still see it as a failed trope introduced to explain an otherwise good arc.
---
Glint's teachings, the influence of Tarir, relative safety from Elder Dragons while still in egg / early hatchling, Maguuma Waters, the knowledge and power of the Pale Tree who broke off from an ED already... sure - all of that could have contributed to Aurene not being maddened. But please, please, please - don't bring it down to love and friendship.
---
If you have the volatile magic to spare, get the Karmic Retribution thing in Sandswept Isles and then just do the metas there. The Hold-back-waves-of-inquest event right before the Specimen Chamber is especially good for farming those karma items.
---
Even with the second retribution tier (6k volatile magic), you can easily get about 15k Karma from that event alone.
---
Praise Obama-lookali.... I mean Joko!

In this game you will not gain favours by trying to kill higher level mobs. They wont give you more xp, infact if you try really high mobs you will mostly not even gain participation at all and if you do you will get way less xp then you would if killing a mob in yor level. 
---
I have a hunch that you might be at the story mission under the seweres were you have to kill many Jellyfishes who puke bleeding at you if you don't avoid that. This is just me guessing but to prevent any mob now and in future you need to bring cleanses to some fights or some mobs. It is easy to swap out if you realize that shit this is a mob that throw condis at me. 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ether_Renewal Is a heal skill that remove conditions. Hopefully you have unlocked it already, if not try to unlock it next time you have enough points.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Cleansing_Fire Is a skill that you can cleanse with. Again might have to unlock that when you have point if you don't have it already.
---
Later on in game there are traits, sigils, runes, weapon skills and so on that help you with condis but at lower levels were you are now those two are probably easy to use if you run in to mobs like that.
---
Id main that for the entertainment value alone
---
&gt; From your own link,
---
&gt; Assimilation could also involve the so-called additive acculturation wherein, instead of replacing the ancestral culture, an individual expands their existing cultural repertoire.
---
&gt; Which from your own link describes what I have been saying this whole time.
---
Are you serious? From the whole article you take one quote that talks about a separate term "additive acculturation" and then take that as you being right?
---
Just a hint: "could also involve" does not mean "is"
---
&gt; Have you not played the main story? We have quite literally saved and done good for lesser-races.
---
And we are right back to ignoring all the bad the "good" races have done. Great argument.
---
&gt; We have saved entire friendly or neutral factions from death at the hands of their own people or their own enemies.
---
And we have decimate and killed other races and factions. But of course, we again only look at the good side of the "good" races.
---
Might I ask what you mean on how they are failing to use lore?
---
Hammer on Guardian is very weak unless the mechanics require you to immobilize something but you can still use it as secondary set behind mace/shield if you want to play support.
---
Skyscale scales.

Skyscale=Helicopter / Griffon=Jet/Glider
---
There is no schedual and usually a few months inbetween but all also depending what what is happening in the game. Like just now they had a Welcome back event and went through the season 4 and gave that for free to all that was online at that point and did not have it already and in the end there was this sale.
---
DLGamer do usually have pretty good prices and they are official retailer someone have the link below.
---
But also if you plan to level your character there is no reason to get the exapansion right now. If you play on your account from 2012 you have dailys and trading post working as intended with no restrictions like the f2p accounts have. And we all still level in the core game so there is no stress to get it at this very moment but you can wait for a while until you feel ready or a sale shows up.
---
Having ultra hard permanent fps drop after alt tabing ( it depends of the duration i'm not in fullscreen the longer the lower fps i have ) making the game unplayable ( like 1-5 fps ) or just a freeze forcing a restart.  
---
IDK if this is due to it i'm uninstalling going to update it if there is a correlation
---
For mounts you need to start Path of Fire storyline - but be aware that this is for lvl 80 charas, although someone can carry you through the first mission so you can get the Raptor mount. You can get other mounts later in PoF, but be aware that Griffon requires 250 gold.
---
You need episode 3 of Living World Season 4 to get the Rollerbeetle mount, and you need to finish Living World Season 4 Episode 6 story to start the Skyscale questline. Warclaw can also be obtained in WvW if you have Path of Fire access.
---
Have you seen the angry people? They're never happy and will always have something to complain about
---
At least you didn't convert all of yours to volatile magic to get an easy 10k for the new home instance node. I have 100 of the new and nothing else besides maybe 6-9 of each from home instance farm the last few days.
---
I've only got between 8 and 80 of all but the motes. Feels bad, man. But at least we're all feeling bad together! Misery loves company, after all!
---
Before I begin, please understand that a lot of builds that are viable for high-end content REQUIRE the switching of weapons. In other words, you'll be using a Hammer AND...
---
It's a significant DPS loss, but you can opt for Hammer instead of Greatsword for a [Power Quickbrand](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vVAQNAS8dnsADFChVBBGBDEEhl4BrKA0AqX7v0a6O1aDkviUA-jxRBQB9V3gxuIA/V9nAr8TwKBBwTAgI7PAA-e) build.
---
&gt; They must have had a decent amount of traffic in and out of Maguuma though, and a fair amount of communication too while Esthel was in Queensdale.
---
In the form of bandits hiding out in the wilderness. To the casual eye, that wouldn't suggest a massive stronghold, but it doesn't argue against it. And based off of Stronghold of the Faithful, their main source was a private ship that sailed out of Lake Doric, one of many.
---
&gt; Wait a lich like Joko counts as "living"???
---
Was more or less saying "he's not a soul".
---
&gt; Anyway I don't mean the circumstances of his immediate escape but rather the solution to dealing with his immortality, or lack thereof. As per GW1 status just feeding him to Dhuum might have been an option and even if that were deemed too dangerous surely the Reapers could have come up with something else had they still been with us at the time. We still had the other Bloodstones too but as you yourself say the ToPK would have been far more convenient.
---
Well, the gods have held a "no influence" approach to Tyria since the Exodus, and double downed on that after the events of Nightfall. Unless Joko threatened them directly, they'd have no interest to kill Joko.
---
So just passing the buck wouldn't have really worked, since the buck wouldn't be taken. And for the Sunspears or Turai, they had neither bloodstone nor easy afterlife access (or in the case of Sunspears, a captured Joko) to try to unbind his magic with.
---
Either way, that doesn't relate Joko to the Mists and Hall of Chains at all. It's just your theory crafting of "could be"s that tries to connect the two when there's no actual connection.
---
Hah yeah, should probably start there...  &gt;&lt;
---
Some people complain about the dumbest shit...
---
Thank you for this! I was a bit worried on how I would aquire them, but this helped me to keep focused.
---
It's also just about money though, Asian players tend to be the ones with hardcore investment and BIG whales so creating content that won't sell in China or won't do well in an Asian market is a big no-no. Asian markets HEAVILY favor western fantasy over eastern fantasy, China being the largest market ALSO has a heavy hand when it comes to allowing or denying that kind of content to even make it past their borders.   
---
If you're in ANet's shoes you have 2 choices, you make a big gamble or you go for steady returns...  
---
A big gamble would be doing Cantha for an expansion and praying modern players in those demographics and regions will still buy it and fork over fistfuls of e-bucks AND that it will do well in NA.
---
It is content. It's just content you don't like doing, which is valid. But there are people who do enjoy this sort of thing. Anet can keep their secrets about acquisition if they want, you're not entitled to know everything all at once.
---
Anyone else remember the skritt mission to steal harpy eggs? Then on the way back they mention making omelettes? Was a pretty clear case of baby eating.
---
I wouldn't say that theory is dead in the water. They did say there was an audio clue around the "mother" line, so while they may not have a full plan for the origin of Elder Dragons, they at least know something of what Mother was about or they wouldn't have added a hint about it and publicly noted it.
---
As I said in another post, the origin of Elder Dragons and a mother of an Elder Dragon may not be the same thing. For example, they weren't sure but they knew enough to say that Aurene was the first Elder Dragon to be born from an egg, which means they are fairly certain the other Elder Dragons were not born from an egg implying some other plans there. And while I don't recall exactly what was said, another commentator said they said their plans were barebones, which means there is something there.
---
Also, I do like the idea that Kralk's voice was split from his Torment due to the Forgotten and if we met him before then it would have just been Torment. That would explain why Mordremoth didn't have anything but Madness.
---
Half a day? Are you insane? That's already too long.

Anything over ONE hour is a timegate for most of the people in r/GW2.

&gt; I argued that they did have some plans for Mother since they said there were clues about it in the audio.
---
Maybe, but they also said they have only bare bones for future plot, that such bare bone seeds won't really come to fruition for years (meaning they have plenty of time to think about it), and they don't have a clue about the origins of "the Elder Dragons".
---
Which implies that all they have about the mother line and the clues that are orally (the word use was "orally", thus it's not merely audio but oral, as in spoken) given.
---
&gt; You're not replying to the OP; you're replying to me. So you should comment on what I said and not what someone else said. If you argue about things we already agreed on in my first post, it doesn't help the discussion at all.
---
AKA "I'm derailing, so derail with me." I'm trying *not* to derail conversations.
---
Dont get it twisted m8 we were aware of our size difference however we have a history with RA and enjoy clapping dem cheeks whenever possible. But if you wanna keep running with this we'll gladly throw hands cuz, just give us a time and place.
---
Heh. I really don't know. I'm guessing it is because I always open up any chests I see when I'm running around HoF maps. I've only map completed all of the maps once, so it probably is from that. From what I've read, running around and grabbing them from random chests is the best way. I'm sure there's some chest guide out there for those maps.
---
a living world episode is Free from the moment it releases and until the next episode is released. that us usually a roughly 3-3½ month period.
---
Beyond that range its for sale on the gemstore for 200 gems per episode or a season bundle (that gets price corrected to reflect any episodes already unlocked on that account)
---
Sometimes Anet does special discounts or events like leading up to War Eternal where each ls4 episode was free for one week in sequence.
---
Once unlocked its free forever for that account.
---
Love this thread!
---
You mean the ones that don't exist? But are always dragged up by people who just come here to endlessly bitch and whine?
---
Normal threads exist in both directions. Criticism about certain aspects of the game for example. Including actual criticism about the Skyscale. Which naturally could also be improved in certain aspects. But that has nothing to do with the whining in most of these threads in the past few days.
---
And we get sometimes get celebration threads. Where people celebrate GW2 as a un game. Without anyone claiming that GW2 is actually flawless. That only exists as a strawman in your head.
---
It’s a pretty clear case of eating eggs.
---
Fun fact: the Domain of Istan Reward Track *does* give a full stack.  The others only give 50 per completion though.
---
I've had almost all LS ressources full in my bank, and I have a limit of 1500
---
Come out Tuesday or Thursday night and you can show how shit we are m8, or keep ducking lul
---
It's literally the definition of a timegate
---
But yes, it is blown out of proportion
---
&gt; that's an origin for ancient eldritch beings. 
---
No, that's an origin of AN ancient eldritch beings, not for them as a group or as a concept.
---
Glyph of Reaping can be tried right now from the gathering tool merchant you can buy it with karma for like 7.5k karma. It's pretty op for malc/straits/plant clusters. My home instance has basically no nodes in it but it could also be powerful there. Industry is still BiS for single gathers though in terms of raw speed.
---
They should also use Gaeting crystals. Due to timegates. Gaeting sounds similar to gate. 
---
Thanks^for^coming^to^my^TED^talk
---
Wow, that’s quality armor!
---
Tomayto tomahto?
---
It's a great feeling when you stop seeing these little fuckers as a threat and more like mobile bloodlust stations.
---
Aww I miss that guy in Lions Arch :(
---
I dont even know what server you're on lmao and I roam so unless you're looking to get clapped in a duel fuck off with your nonsense. It's always the shit guilds who immediately respond with "gvg me brah" lmao ive seen all I need to see from this video and your comments.
---
To be frank, minion Necro (especially reaper) is in a league of its own for open world content.  No other class can pack a punch as hard as Reaper and still be disgustingly tanky.  There are other above average classes though.
---
Ranger isn’t particularly tanky, but like minionmacer it has a pet to draw agro.  Plus longbow packs a pretty decent punch from range, so you can let you pet take agro and kite anything that comes near you, or just burst them down with greatsword.
---
Guardian is the opposite.  It doesn’t have anything to draw agro, but has some nice passive damage mitigation.  Plus it packs crazy burst damage, so you can kill most things before they become a threat (especially as a Dragonhunter).
---
Have you ever watched Happy Tree Friends? I highly suggest you to watch the show. It's super cute, fun and entertaining.
---
Eh, they're lowering the timegates to "Tyrian days" (2 hours real world time), why is feeding your dragon-child 3 times per (Tyrian) day stuffing them to bursting? Don't you feed your children 3 meals a day if you can afford to?
---
well, technically from the baby skyscales point of view you are actually feeding it 3 pieces of food every 12 days. :P I bet it wants that 12 food now lol
---
(each ingame day is 2 hours and you have to wait upto 24 hours between feedings)
---
I have all the expansions. Just felt I should do base game stuff before delving into extra. Did the first quest on one character for PoF and was super lost by everything. But I haven’t gotten any of the extra live story seasons yet. Will skyscale always be there do you know? I keep reading stuff about time gates. Does that mean it’s gone after a time or it’ll take this time to do it all?
---
because it's so obvious that they need to pad playertime and numbers right now, they are in a precarious position and if they are planning a future for gw2 then they need to keep everyone busy with minimal effort so they can work on something long term. their statement about making it feel like the dragon has grown up in a couple more real life days holds no water, it's one of the weakest excuses they could have chosen
---
&gt; Well, the gods have held a "no influence" approach to Tyria since the Exodus, and double downed on that after the events of Nightfall. Unless Joko threatened them directly, they'd have no interest to kill Joko.
---
Not the gods, the Reapers and the Judge when Joko starts siphoning souls in earnest to fuel his war efforts against central Tyria. Plus retribution for the stint with Balth because I'm pretty sure most of them would know he was *PNG*'d and wouldn't want anyone helping or profiteering off a rogue ex-god. Balthazar after all was *somewhat* concerned the other gods would come after him if they discovered *him* breaking the no interference policy first.
---
What *actually happened* in the Hall of Chains ultimately does not really matter in this context. What matters is that everyone was busy and in no shape to go after Joko *or Balthazar*. Just like how they needed Kormir to be a cryptic jerk and ghost us.
---
Hello, is Day 7 the last one? i hope :DDDDD, thanks for your job
---
Sorry, I didn't see any other posts on the sub about it. Yes, I am planning to start fresh and I know that I don't need them yet. That is exactly what I said in my post; I am starting fresh and just wondering about when I should expect to see a sale again. I understand that you aren't ArenaNet but certain games have certain sales cycles or seasonal sales in which case you can guess when the next sale will be.
---
had us in the first half, not gonna lie
---
When a new Living world episode releases it will unlock for everyone without additional payment as long as they log into the game. This is the case until the next episode is released. If you miss the Episode then you have to buy it from the gem store with gems that you got either through real money or gold.
---
Which means, if you log into the game today you will unlock Living world Season 4 Episode 6 for your account. 
---
This is the same for all accounts, even free accounts. Which also means that if you have a free account and login today you will unlock the episode without having to pay for it. The only difference is that you will not be able to play it since you need the Path of fire expansion to play season 4. Here are the seasons and which expansion you need)
---
* Season 2 (Core game)
---
* Season 3 (Heart of Thorns)
---
* Season 4 (Path of Fire)
---
Unlocking the episodes retroactively can be done IIRC in two ways, either each episode separately through the journal or with the full package, IIRC the package is cheaper in the end with each episode being at 160 gems each.
---
\*As long as they're of the same weight class
---
Not going to happen. The game evolved away from guilds years ago and wont change direction now. 
---
I'm quite certain many players would be upset about having to be social / interact with players / join a guild for any type of novelty, even if they're playing an mmorpg and joining guilds is trivial.
---
Long term this game turns into a single player where you treat other people as npcs that are only there for your convenience.
---
It's not challenging, it's fucking awful. I just completed it and I was not satisfied at the end and a job well done, I was relieved that this pure, unadulterated stream of sheer awfulness was finally over. I definitely won't be coming back to this subreddit with players like this in it, and I'm seriously considering whether I should continue with the game at all. That was a truly dreadful grind for literally zero payoff.
---
Nearby necros also gain life force from the merchant's death.
---
Mesmers and mounts thankfully made the ordeal take less than half an hour for me :)
---
Even if you tack on the extra VM expense it's +128g, so you're paying 10g more than the Griffon if you want to think about it that way.
---
I think of it as "I didn't have to spend more than 50% out of my pocket on the Trading Post or purchasing items."
---
Potato Potatwa
---
Just like you mean the 10 threads every day that don't exist, but are always dragged up by people who just come here to endlessly praise and "celebrate" without much arguments to them, and disregarding the potential flaws that could be fixed to make it better?
---
See, it can go both ways, and doesn't push the discussion forward. The difference is, I'm not delusional about the few threads from people who complain without arguments. I'm against them just as much. Unfortunately those are few and far between compared to the ones voicing their opinions in a constructive way, with arguments. Don't be delusional either, pal, and accept it for the way it is.
---
From my point of view, it's just a classic case of double standards, if some threads are just near copy/paste of each other to "celebrate" the game, it's okay, because you agree with them. If some threads are voicing concerns about a specific feature of the game but you don't agree with them, then they're just all crying and whining. Kinda dishonest if you ask me, but if that's your thing, not like it's uncommon on the internet.
---
As somebody who picked the game back up recently and doesn't even have all the stories unlocked, this is disheartening. Time to farm the gold for gems!
---
too edgy for me
---
In istan, cache runs are also a decent source of kralkatite.
---
The colours are fine, a lot of the pieces of the map come from Mists so  them looking out of place actually makes sense IMO.
---
Debris however would be good.
---
I don't consider the material requirement a timegate. Timegates are goals that can only be completed by waiting. The feeding and the waiting inbetween the collections are timegates by that definition.
---
You might be able to just buy all of them on the new map. There's a vendor, but I'm not sure if it'll lock you out of buying them if you don't have the other episodes. 5 / day max, so 50 days of buying every day. Tedious as all crap, but doable technically. In that timeframe, you might just be able to save the gold to buy gems to get the one episode you're missing. Your friend though, that might be the best bet if they can't get the episodes right now.
---
I had that same sort of feeling for Zojja, she's there during the PS and in the dungeons and she played a part in the backstory and lore, every single time I was super interested to do more things with her and learn more about her. I even chose to save her over Logan in the jungles, but sadly she's basically been dead since HoT, some mysterious Mordremoth thing that's vaguely alluded to but never mentioned again...  
---
And I know it's because her voice actor has a kid or whatever and they don't want to recast, so whatever.   
---
I fear that this is what will happen to Taimi too, I came into the game just before HoT was released, so I never had the living world stuff to build her up or introduce her, she was just this adorable little tiny Asura. When I first saw her get out of Scruffy I melted, she's so small and hobbling so slowly... I wanted to help her, probably that parental side of me rearing it's ugly head but still, I liked her and I wanted to genuinely enjoy her as a teammate. But she was sick, that's the one thing I knew before hand, she was sick and so I never could get too attached, she could be the next character to get shipped off into technically not-dead status.   
---
I can already tell Rox is getting ready to skip off to greener pastures, she's been basically dead for a while and she shows up in full Olmakahn garb wanting to have a 'talk' with Braham...   
---
How long until Taimi has to be 'hospitalized' for an unspecified length of time?  
---
How long until all my friends leave me?
---
You're not wrong there. My only argument to that is some people (like me) don't have that kinda gold right now but it's more on me because legendary crafting and few friends to Fractal / Raid with.
---
"Treats" were just as big as actual food and you could toss them at your baby as much as you wanted.
---
It's the web app itself - we cache dailies when you're online, and you can load the app when you're not and still have the data. Feel free to add a shortcut to your home screen if you want a more app-like experience. Note that the data may not be accurate if the date has changed - nicer caching is one of the papercuts I'm going to address eventually, but for now "today" and "tomorrow" labels are accurate for the day you were last online.

If that gave me the answer to why I can't login, I obviously wouldn't come here
---
The changes allows someone or something with an existing API key to request sub-keys that have an expiration date and are more restrictive.
---
For example, I generate a key that allows access everything on my account and give to Efficency. Efficiency then needs to give an API key to another service (hypothetically, let's call it Service 2) but only for Skins. Instead of giving the API key with full permissions to Service 2, Efficiency can call that new API endpoint and create a key with only the Skins permissions. That way Service 2 has a key that only allows it to query Skins.

I mean the one that was updated on May 14. are you running any other stuff besides arcdps?
---
but it's smooth and silky
---
I guess OP thinks it is better for parents to starve their babies instead
---
Thank you very much for clarifying. Even better than what I thought.
---
your question wasn't "why can't I login?".. it was "is the server down?"
---
your question was answered.
---
I'm running arcdps, arcdps build templates, arcdps extras, d912pxy, TacO, Yolomouse all without issues.
---
Me too. This is going to take forever. sadface
---
And Birds
---
They're just what the terrain twists into after being near Kralkatorrik for too long.
---
Thanks!
---
&gt; You are right. We should just get rid of all the RP elements in RPGs. They are just so annoying. And there is definitely no balance to be had between those RP elements and necessary suspension of disbelieve for gameplay reasons.
---
If the game didn't have restrictions what is there to stop you from doing it at the rate you think is correct?
---
https://i.imgur.com/R8gNHkG.jpg
---
is there a way i can know the coming skins or its random ?
---
Damn, what game is that?
---
I'd say where you have above average complicated vertical and horizontal terrain to cross. Where the Springer's hard to land, Skyscale will stick and has true flight, so it has much better control of where exacxtly to land. Its movement ability also beats the Griffon in climbing scenarioes, where the Griffon's dives are of no help. Also, again true flight and it sticks to surfaces, while the Griffon is always falling and has to recurringly flap the wings.
---
So, as an example, scaling those tree branches in Melandru's realm to get quickly from a low place to a higher one, thats out of reach for one Springer jump or maybe even blocks it That combines both horizontal and vertical movement, at which the Skyscale excels. The duo of Springer and Griffon does a lot, but in comparison it is clunky, constantly having to switch between Springer and Griffon. And oh boy do i already miss not being able to stick to a wall.
---
Yea, just annoyed the limit is so low
---
It's about sending a message.
---
I used to use her videos for jumping puzzles way before dulfy was even on my radar (been playing since launch, with the exception of season 4, since I wanted to binge it, and few bits in season 1).
---
It is nice to know she is still active.
---
This.
---
The mount better be better than griffon lmao
---
Unfortunately there are prior steps where you must have all season 4 maps. You take the egg to specific points in each season 4 map to progress to the next achievement.
---
&gt; dodge+jump macros.
---
What is the use of this macros? Is it a PvP thing?
---
You can also farm someone's home instance with nodes.
---
Hmm, maybe it's time to get an MMO mouse, where each button on the mouse are just keys for each mount.
---
Oh really? Hmm didn't know that.
---
&gt;Don't know how to implement pictures here
---
You can't embed pics in text posts. Either upload an image (can't have actual text apart from title) or just link to imgur in the body of the post like you did
---
Welp, time to get my two level 80 alts portal scrolls.
---
Im going to be short and concise. 
---
Things I like:
---
\+ Going to other maps , this populates them and makes every map more enjoyable.
---
Things i am neutral:
---
\#Charged quartz: Honestly, I don't see why people that saved charged quartz can't profit of their daily effort that has been useless for years.
---
 \# Timegating materials. I am ok on not getting it inmediately if I dont have the materials. it is the same for any other content. Any legendary asks for this.
---
Things I do NOT like:
---
\- You dont earn exp on mastery tracks until you unlock skyscale. Ridiculous.
---
\- Boring colection, at least day 1 consilt of pixel hunting 3 colections on the new map. Hiding 300 sick skyscales, egss, scales  IS NOT CONTENT. Its a lazy way to replace real content, and an insult to the players. We usually can tolerate 1 of these per map, for the Ap farmers only. But that is it!! The first three colections are pixel hunting!! And I'm unsure if there is more of this torture ahead!!
---
\- Not enabling all collections at the same time: Honestly, why don't let people choose the order on what they do things, so they can go fromm one another annd not burn their brains into it.
---
\- Ridiculous farm that goes  way way beyond than farming a legendary weapon. Is this a japanese MMO that requires me to leave my family and work just to be able to access new content? Because the only reason I play GW2 is because it is time friendly. 1 hour a day will guarantee you access to all content. Or at least that is how it used to be.
---
\- Skyscale is shit. Bad bunny(pun intended), terrible griffon.
---
\- Timegated feeding. Honestly if I wanted a tamagochi, i would buy tamagochi.
---
will be around ~160g
---
&gt; What is it dimmishing? Is it changing gameplay, no. Is it altering the combat, no. Is it affecting the story, no. Is it changing fundamental how you play the game, no.
---
Its making the game shittier by preventing you from playing it when you have time.
---
&gt;You obviously haven't unlocked the mount if you can't use it, you are working to use it/unlock.
---
You want to form an emotional attachment to your mount. Like I said, you are free to do that by not using for an entire week after you officially unlock it by pretending that its growing.
---
 Why should everone else suffer?
---
&gt;Are you incapable of multitasking?
---
I'm not intrested in any other tasks. This is why I was waiting for the episode to drop. To give me something to do.
---
What advantage does daredevil have in jps?
---
Is centaur leather made from the horse part or the human part?
---
I’ll give it a try, thank you so much for your work!
---
I say the game is grindy I get downvoted. Everyone else complains, "it's cool now you can say it".
---
So same as with griffon: all my gold haha
---
I discovered that consuming volatile unbound magic while in flight adds "fuel" so you can go higher.
---
Good points, though immersion is broken by all those core maps, with rectangular mountain lines. It's good that they make the new maps (except this one) fit better into the world and feel more natural.
---
Nodes are per char until you hit an account limit  (20-40ish from gathering, varies per map iirc)
---
Time is money friend.
---
Probably not. Using the bond ability that restores endurance gives some extra green bar fuel, but if you're already at maximum height (i.e. emptied the green bar and now hovering in place) and use that "extra" fuel to go above your flight canopy, the red bar fills up enough to send you back down to where your flight canopy still is.
---
They are immortal they will respawn
---
It's instincts for me.  
---
I'm like "AH SHIT...oh wait"
---
Nope...it only hits extra nodes....im just doing some range tests to see if it was worth it
---
It will make the flax farm go a little quicker.
---
I thought the height limit was purely dependant on your fuel gauge.
---
If you rise up, run out of fuel, cling to wall, sacrifice endurance for fuel, fly higher, wait for endurance to refill, rinse and repeat, what will stop you from endlessly rising?
---
With nodes the best bet is tap them if you're going by it, but don't troll the whole map looking for them. Its faster to just switch chars and knock out more hearts.
---
I thought that one was too messy, imo. I like this one better
---
Well, the overlap is wherever you need precision to scale heights and a little bit of horizontal distance as well. The Springer won't be beaten at cliffs specifically designed for it. But when you really want to go unintended routes, that are not easily taken with the Springer alone, that is where the Skyscale shines.
---
&gt; Do you think that this direction could be changed though? 
---
This direction could most definitely be changed. But I highly doubt anet will do this, and if they did, plenty of players here would throw a tantrum. (Even if it doesn't affect them). 
---
&gt; I think that improving guilds would have a far greater positive effect on retaining new players than driving away old players and that the people who are likely to get upset about optional group content are going to get upset at any changes from the current formula. 
---
I fully, 100% agree with this notion.
---
But anet has already driven away many players looking for a more social MMO. And plenty of those who remain will be upset as you noted. Anet isn't suddenly going to make a great, guild-based MMORPG after actively neglecting guilds in their development for several years.
---
So I fully agree it WOULD be great for the game, it's not going to happen. The game evolved away from focussing on social aspects of mmorpgs, has done so for years, and will continue to do so in the future. 
---
I admire your idealism but I don't share your optimism.
---
Ahhh, cheers
---
I expected SpongeBob SquarePants
---
Tell that to the mobs I'm mowing down. ;) Combined with the lack of downtime from never being downed and not having to worry much about dodging and avoiding damage the damage is plenty for comfortably taking down anything you come across either in open world or personal story. Super fun to play!
---
People act like Season 6 is gonna start before they can finish their Skyscale collection
---
i don't see it tbh
---
Any specific builds for those profs you'd recommend?
---
A hole in a ceiling or a high up alcove springers can't reach, indoors where  a griffon can't get a height advantage on said hole or alcove.
---
Fuel drain while above height limit does. Normally you don't drain any fuel just for hovering, but above the height limit your fuel drains just as fast as your endurance regenerates while doing nothing. And because both endurance regen and BoV cooldown are frozen once you stick to a wall, there is a cap of how high you can get without landing.
---
Every time I do Foulbear I think the same thing.
---
Whenever I kill an ogre and in his dying breath he asks  "What about...the children?" I realize that I am just burning the homes and killing the pets of a bunch of ogres who never actually leave their stronghold at all or bother the people outside.
---
Then I remember I have the chance to get an treasured bunny that sells for 300 or so gold.
---
Why not just temporarily put your portal scroll in a shared slot? It's only temporary.
---
We used to have both. And everything that isn't easy to solo "isn't accessible enough for casual players", "doesnt' appeal to the target audience" and similar complaints on repeat until it's turned into easily soloable. 
---
Hence the current state of gw2. GW2 wasn't always just like this, but one group aimed to kill as much of the diversity as possible because they paid for the game so they deserve access to all content and rewards without any effort or gameplay.
---
Teleport to friend stones are also a good option, if you have them.
---
It wouldn't be faster than having more characters and grinding hearts. It's more that if he only has one level 80 he's going to hit a hard cap with how much progress he can make in the PvE maps per day. So he's going to hit a wall where he can't progress while other players might just swap to another character to advance faster. The point is that can still make some progress forward via reward tracks once he hits the map caps.
---
Hopefully with this collection people will start doing them, I barely saw people doing meteors even when istan farming was in its hey day.
---
yes ya can
---
I think it's meant to be by exclusiveness, not order you can get them in the story. Griffon has always been the most exclusive, and now that's skyscale.
---
Are you making a nod to Cantha?
---
Question from someone who hasn’t started it yet - are there any parts that are un-solo’able?  Eg that you need a full map to hope to do?
---
Were people just as upset with the Provisioner's Tokens?
---
I bet you will. Gonna jump me with all those guys too? We know you aren't fighting real groups soooo
---
Only salvage exotics if it has a rune/sigil that's valuable as BL recovers instead of salvages upgrades. Otherwise sell it unless it's around ecto value then salvage with masters tier.
---
Newer player here, I've been playing on and off for quite some time but haven't really stuck with any of my characters. I think I'm in it for good now though, and I just have 2 noob questions I'd appreciate some insight on:
---
1. I understand Living Worlds are fillers in between larger DLCs and that everything but Season 1 can be unlocked, either by logging in when an episode is active or with gems. Is there any reason I should unlock previous episodes other than for story purposes? What am I missing out on if I don't get them? If I go from the vanilla 1-80 story to HoT to PoF, will the story make enough sense?
---
2. I'm in the stage between level 10 - 20 where I finished the story I unlock at 10 but haven't gotten to the story at level 20 yet. I'm having fun just running around the map, unlocking everything and exploring, but is there anything else I should be doing? Does this trend continue to level 80, where I just do whatever the heck I want in between unlocking stories?
---
Character mastery. For a new class, you're not used to it at all. And it's even worse for the mesmer. New players often commit this mistake.
---
Any chance the hatchling tool itself gathers multiple hits at once for guild hall/glyph of bounty?
---
Damn you got me...
---
BTW, Gathering Merchants are selling

---
Give her a follow/sub. She makes amazing helpful content &amp; is well worth the sub.
---
arrr ve de vaddies?
---
I don't really know much about either of them but at this point I'd say AyinMaiden has a guide up for Skyscale where as Dulfy does not :V
---
To give you control. Where the Griffon slips and inevitably falls, you can stick to, giving you the boon of taking your time for precision decision making. It also helps to prevent falling off of a ledge just because you missed it by one millimeter.
---
Nice strawman
---
Definitely was. Their work is AMAZING! ♡  
---
Makes me inspired to draw again after about 2 years. :3  
---
Good bot!
---
Yes
---
Only place where I can remember dragon remains are Desert Highlands...but it would be interesting to see the bodies of lesser dragons affected by their elder cousins
---
Whatever you prefer!
---
I just keep alts parked for mistonium and do the rest via hearts and events
---
Dunno. Between Springer, Griffon, and the dismount mastery, I can reach pretty much anything. 
---
I guess the Skyscape is a good alternative for people who don't yet have the Griffon, but I'm honestly unsure whether I will use the Skyscale for anything other than looking goddamn awesome.
---
This is like if Istan and Vabbi have a child.
---
Same as aurora, why is this community so entitled?
---
damn nibba, cry some more
---
do you? really?
---
Bad pun.
---
It's the nonsense lol random breached the 4th wall humor. It gets annoying after a while.
---
I get that, but all the maps shape tells me is that the hole in the sky happen to be close to a square.
---
I have all of the mounts and i already use it frequently. But in any case, you're right, everyone will have to make up their own mind, its about flavor as well.
---
the exact same thing
---
Agreed plus with the nods(raw mats) you will get from wvw; you will  need to figure what you can craft from them to generate gold for your income. xD
---
Couple hours, I think. The fastest one to get (and the first one) is the raptor. The other ones will require you to level up some masteries on the mounts
---
You don't even have to use a boost for that. AFAIK you can jump in with another player who opens the instance for you and finishes it with you. That should unlock the raptor for you without wasting a boost.
---
More video, less written.  I had more luck with her methods of jumping for catmander than I did with Dulfy's.  I also think she's wildly underappreciated considering how much she has out there and how little we talk about her.
---
But how is this the players fault?
---
Anet shows a reward (the skyscale) but doesn't tell them right away how many and what kind of collections there are. Then people get annoyed because it seems like there will never be an end, and people rage after every single new reveal. 
---
It's really not hard to understand how players work. Show them a reward and the path to achieving it then let them decide if it's worth their effort and how fast or slow they wanna work towards it. 
---
People simPly hate surprises if they are not improving some aspect of the game
---
There's a JP, [Palace of Aban](https://youtu.be/RdZuWa1QBE8), where this might help. I know it's very reachable with the Griffon, but I didn't have one at the time :)
---
If you mount up mid air, is the point of mounting up your "starting point" at which you can hover indefinetly with full fuel?
---
If so what happens if you dismount with Bond of Dismounting Mid Air and mount up again? Is this a cheesy way to gain height?
---
I mean yes the island are way more detailed and better, but in my opinion it's too light and tiny to break the square feeling of the map
---
I can't tell the sounds apart well enough to say if it sounds like waves or not. But since we know pretty much nothing about Bubbles, I wouldn't rule out something like this... But we don't have a ton to go on at the moment either. It is an interesting theory at least and I wouldn't say there is much disproving it, but they could have meant some other hint... Either way, it may not be S5 but the Deep Sea Dragon is starting to feel inevitable with recent revelations.
---
Engine is perfect for JPs. It was 100% built for platforming. Even in 2012 it was smooth af.
---
As far as we know just too busy with life stuff, couldn't make the time for guides this episode.
---
Didn't think anyone really did the meteors anymore though.
---
about 10 minutes, which should be roughly the length of the first pof story mission.
---
Different races need to have the same movement abilities, which makes non-humans very clunky. Also a lot of cliffs involve pushing myself against them while spamming spacebar until I actually manage to make it up. And a good amount of platforms you can stand on are pretty ambiguous looking.
---
I love platformers, but play a game like Mario Galaxy or Odyssey and then a GW2 jumping puzzle. The latter barely feels functional in comparison
---
Thanks for the answer! I read that seasons are purchasable with in game currency (gold), but the information is pretty outdated and more current websites only mention that they're unlockable with gems. Do you know if it's possible with unlock it with gold?
---
I love her Living World playthroughs. Got all the story I missed in LW2  without buying with gems and without aggravating commentary voice-over.
---
I say so...using it with unbound tool has let me get three instant gathers from the new lwE6 node
---
I had a personal guide on my Google drive, this and some other advice helped tailor-make it a bit more to my charas!
---
My griffon was so much easier to get and flies faster. This shit right here is just beyond fucking annoying.... Hope they lay off more people. I dont give a fuck down vote my shit.
---
Well actually on a lot of maps (even base PoF), there is a lot od edges that are just above Springer's jump range (you can't jump up, but you can get on it if using bond of faith when on top of the jump). Those spots will be easy to get up with this mount.
---
I always felt like that even PoF maps don't really feel natural. I made a quick edit of how it could look:
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/TlQLNbq.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/TlQLNbq.jpg)
---
 &gt; Glyph of Reaping
---
If you want to test out this glyph, you can buy limited tools with it preslotted at gathering vendors. The range is actually pretty big. It will consume charges as if you mined the other nodes normally.
---
Ahahaha, no. These things exist mostly to keep people logging in and thinking about the game, as that will increase profits from micro transactions.
---
Thank goodness I've been saving a stack of each  assuming the new legendary trinket would need them...
---
Why is it when someone runs out of things to say they jump to "u must be angry"? I'm just pointing out how bad this video and the players in it were. I'm on anvil rock, platinum knight holo with warbringer, red tentacles, red Mohawk. Tell your roamers, I'm happy to make some videos of my own :)
---
It's because gems are the direct currency you use to buy the seasons, but gems are purchasable both by real life money and by using gold. It's something like $10/800 gems if you're in NA, and each episode of each season costs 200 gems, with a 20% discount if you buy the entire season. On the other hand, you can convert gold to gems, at a fluctuating rate. For a while it was around 50 gold/200 gems, but I think the price has gotten worse last I checked
---
Different strokes, I can't enjoy them compared to dedicated platformers
---
Nice to see you thought i meant it because "you are not butthurt" and not because of your blatant defense of ANet and pinning the blame on the players.
---
Go play with your free mount skins man.
---
Victor was kind enough to involve [my real life flock!](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bv3xnSdBI-T/).
---
That's beautiful.
---
How many mastery points are required for it?
---
Galaxy was sometimes worst.
---
Word see u soon
---
Yh sorry about that. I was wondering after I posted whether I highlighted the right things or not.   
---
To clarify I amde this post at what I considered "guaranteed" amount each day, since the events and gathering depend on each persons play time. I tried adding in brackets what else can be done for more of them daily but didn't wanna make the post too long, so included links for each currency where it says like all the sources including gathering nodes, chests and events.   
---
Should have formatted it better
---
&gt;It's an MMO. It's not meant to be played in 15 hour blocks. It's meant to be played daily for years. Developers have to find ways to pace progression so that players have a reason to keep logging in. It's why we have dailies. Daily timegates are an easily implemented way of doing this. 
---
In all honesty, do you really think it's a good concept that someone is telling you when and how to play a game? Why would they even care if i log in daily for 1 hour or once every week for 7? They should care about monetizing the game correctly and fairly and let the players play at their own pace.
---
If you think about it, that's what every great game is about. Freedom of choice. If someone just wants the mount, let them rush to it in 15 hours, if someone wants to chill and stretch it over a few weeks fine. But don't tell people how to play a game.
---
 we start guild wars 2 but we can't download. Client not working properly. I have 100-mbit download but download speed is not stable. 100kb/3mb ( my friend is having the same problem, couldn't find a solution...) BEST CLİENT EVER
---
Ayin is the best! Perfect when you’re trying to figure where a jp even starts.
---
Geezus, no kidding! EXTREMELY underappreciated! I feel awful for having never heard of her site until just now.  :(
---
Sure you can get anywhere by chaining mounts and dismounts together, but perhaps the Skyscale will make some of these places easier or less finicky to get to.
---
This seems like an AoE gathering whereas Bounty is extra gathering strikes, not really comparable IMO. One saves time and other gives more mats.
---
It would be interesting to compare this with Glyph of Industry though (faster gathering).
---
If the chunks of ground were made from goo, I'd agree with you but they aren't. I definitely think it's an odd decision and not one I'd make, but honestly it doesn't mean much. Some people could say it's lazy and I'd probably agree with them, I guess.
---
It would be shouts. The heal skill would be "Commander, to me." and the elite would be "This won't end well."
---
Don't feel pressured I made this breakdown for myself since I like grinding a lot in a short period of time rather than little over a longer period. This post is for grinders, impatient people and to provide insight so people can simply calculate how they will space it out in a certain period of time. Thought it helps seeing it all broken down into numbers so we can see exactly how long it can take (it's what I always do for my collections for I have a hard time visualizing and spacing without a breakdown).
---
I ended up just using the numpad. Eveything else in easy reach of my left hand was already taken so it's all that's left.
---
Diflourite Crystal (Sandswept Isles):
---
you can park a twink under the cube in water there, theirs always a node you can gather daily here.
---
If you want to go with the lazy route
---
Yes, mounting up midair sets your height limit. But you also drain a small amount of fuel by doing so. I still try to figure out what determines this.
---
It does not seem possible to gain indefinite height by simple remounting with BoF, but swapping between Griffon and Skyscale  back and forth seems to do the trick and allows for infinite height gain. Am doing it as i write this. I'll update the post accordingly.
---
also if you find a bounty train, but I don't know how common they are anymore (haven't had the urge to do one in a while)
---
You personally? Or your 10-15 man "roam" squad. My video going to end up a Benny hill video with you guys desperately chasing 1 person to avenge your online fee fees :p
---
Anet = WESAYSO Corporation
---
I understand your thinking but the idea of "lesser" races has merit in fantasy and scifi. A concept that is lost on too many of us today.
---
We humans are lucky, there's only one language capable sapient specie on our planet, us. Imagine if there was another specie of hominid who survived. One smart enough to talk with about complex ideas but not smart enough to function in modern society.
---
We couldn't treat them as us, that wouldn't be fair to them. We also couldn't treat them as animals either. There'd need to be a new in between distinction, like lesser sapients.
---
That's what they do with petrol in real life :o)
---
Hey quick question... where do I put the gas?
---
Returning player here, I absolutely love the Mesmer class, and I know it's not the best do wise (or even close)
---
But Jesus I feel like i don't do ANY damage to most mobs in PoF
---
Well depending on your class and what weapons you use.
---
For instance a warriors guardians and revenants should do armor and maybe weaponsmith.
---
Engineers,Rangers, and thieves should do leather 
---
Necro, Mesmer and elementalists should do tailoring and maybe artificing
---
Is that what the bot wants me to think?? o_o
---
Does it do anything different when used on rich nodes?
---
you don't have to do the story missions for any map past the first go, just get the portal scroll from the respective vendor and port your alts like that.
---
The position rewinder is my best friend. Thanks to it, I managed to complete Chalice of Tears without wanting to bash my head into a wall halfway through yesterday.  
---
Having completed that thing legit feels so nice.
---
Seems to be about 900 range gathering circle, not too certain though. Running Taco's range circles seem to hold true.
---
That is pretty cool.
---
But it does have the same clear type of benefits just like any mount has over another. They all play by the same rules, have their up- and downsides. No mount must be outclassed by another in all use cases, its all about providing options. Sure, in real world usage some mounts see much less use than others simply because we do one thing more often than another and there'll always be a BiS mount for this specific type of activity. But the Skyscale really enhances our portfolio and is worth the effort, because even with its restrictions it opens up a lot of possibilities.
---
What kind of gear are you using and what kind of build are you using? Hard to diagnose what's the issue without getting more details.
---
Thank you so much!
---
Wait, why is this being downvooted literally not a minute after posting? You didn't even read the post...
---
the third mastery makes a huge difference
---
Currently at work but I believe it's a full set of berserker? I know it used to be soldier but I'm 90% sure I finally replaced it all
---
Aah I see, thanks!
---
Quick question, the vendor in Dragonfall where you can trade currency for VM, is it once per account or once per character?
---
From Asuran body bits, to the destruction of the 4th wall. It’s been quite the journey
---
why didn't you post this on your main btw
---
Some people only have time to play on certain days, or at certain times. Personally, I don't have much free time during the week but can often join in the nolife grind on weekends if I want. Unfortunately, I happened to finish the first collection right after reset which meant losing an entire day before I could work on the next collection.  I don't care about people like you obtaining rewards earlier than I will be able to, I just want the ability to work toward goals of my choosing when I do have time to play.
---
My guild in NA has dungeon runs twice a week.
---
You're completely allowed to do that. Nobody in the general user base here will censor you for voicing your opinions.
---
You just need to acknowledge that they enjoy the same privileges and can voice theirs too, even if that opinion is that the one you hold is one they find to be nonsense.
---
You're not being victimized, it's just a critical response to thoughts you chose to throw out there. You can't just say, "Here's what I think and don't say anything unless you agree with me."
---
Oh neat! That's very interesting, it's a bit hard to make out but tried to do some googling and found [this picture](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D6-iye5XsAAKeEG.jpg) and [this picture](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D68uyHeWsAAoTD1.jpg:large) on their twitter from a couple days ago and maybe that's just land and sky? Hard to make out exactly what's going on. I could definitely see it being a bit of a teaser though.
---
Yes, which is why I have multiple sets of legendary armor. Having all the different stat variants with different runes across 6 pieces is a combinatorial nightmare.
---
Trinkets though? Not a chance. Maybe if the full set of trinkets equated to a single legendary in cost, but *a single trinket*? That's a joke.
---
I thought Kralkatorrik's Torment was the actual magic from Abaddon, torturing him from the inside.
---
You know, the Elder Dragons started waking up after Abaddon's death, due to his unleashed magic.
---
I haven't watched the newest Teatime yet. I just think it would be more healthy for the game if every new instance had more longevity.
---
How long did the developers spend time making the Aurene flying instance? And we played it only once? What exactly is the benefit for Arenanet as a company? 
---
It's wasted potential. And if the community can't see that, then the living story you play once and never again, where you only log in once every 4 months, is *exactly* what this community deserves.
---
I always assumed the EDs were never really these mindless forces of nature, that it was just up until the commander nobody had ever managed to get close to them as a threat for the EDs to say anything. They are after all apex predators, they see us as ants, and we see them as hurricanes out of control.
---
Obviously Kralkatorrik went a bit off the rail cause he consumed a bit too many different types of magics.
---
Either way excitingly everything we know about the EDs is up in the air, and it'll be interesting to see how the devs proceed with their development!
---
Matriarch in vb
---
Do you and your friend have the same ISP and/or the same router model?  Some ISPs throttle game ports and some routers have software that throttles large file transfers over wi-fi.
---
The command line argument -clientport 443 can often bypass ISP port throttling.
---
So I can't test it because I hit my HI last reset...I can test later today...but as long as the nodes are within like 900 range it works
---
GW introduction of hard mode was one of the best additions to the game. Or revitalized old content and made new content really fun. And it was completely optional. 
---
People who are hating need to realize they leading a cushy life.
---
Any source for that and any other weapons that could have been once around?
---
I only remember elementalist having sword and ranger having rifle.
---
I recently decided to download my Guild Wars 2 client after probably 5 years or more of not playing. I hoped on WoW and remembered all the fun I had in GW2. So my client finishes its download and I put my login info in. I have been banned for 'participating or helping with RMT'. Now I am familiar with how hard Anet goes after these people but I have never associated myself with any of that. Too much risk to have my bank info in the hands of those people. What are the chances of Anet restoring my account? I have changed my password and even placed SMS authentication for extra security.  I submitted a ticket today but I'm expecting a long wait for a reply. VenomOFwAR.8430 is my account that was permabanned. Anyone have some insight or am I just screwed?
---
&gt;  They focus on making it soloable. 
---
How long would it take of developer time tweaking this for a group mode, versus developing a new raid wing with new models and voice acting?
---
You are blowing this extremely out of proportion. I do not think I'm being censored. If you want to go around shouting at people their opinions about arbitrary aspects that affect the way game play fits into the schedule they have, go ahead. I don't think it's mature nor a healthy contribution to a game's community. People are more than welcome to disagree with me, lol.
---
And heavy armor, don't forget about that.
---
Cool, I'm still on the feeding part of the skyscale collection and I haven't really been playing in between feedings, but now I can log on and farm the other living world maps while I wait instead of standing around.
---
&gt; The right pair of shoes can make or break an outfit.
---
Cant wear shoes with an outfit...
---
Really nice!
---
Per acc per day, so 5 max of each sadly
---
Someone got my reference!
---
It's regarding whether doing the story gives currency or not. If doing the story gave like 25-50 currency it would be very worth doing with each char. But since it doesn't it should be disregarded for this grind
---
Mostly just branded structures. Maybe Kralk was secretly an artist/architect?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/2zb4xj/datamining_revenant_weapon_skills/
---
Oh thought it was a rock
---
It's an account-wide unlock, like the beginner mount, yes?
---
Actually I would ignore the fact the Dragons are balanced in a certain way. In the long run it wouldn't work out.
---
Which Dragon can bring death but also bring life? All of them
---
Which Dragon has the ability to shape their land into anyway they see fit? All of them
---
Which Dragon can use the elements to their advantage? Eventually, all of them.
---
I would look more towards the races of the game and why it has always been 5.
---
3) THERE IS NOTHING TO DO DEAD GAEM
---
Hey! Mesmer main here. Essentially every spec can do incredible DPS as far as open world is concerned. Are you playing core mesmer? Most of the core specs have trouble holding up to the elite specs.
---
Because ArenaNet hates money.
---
Sell plushies? Oh no, the logistics are sooo hard.
---
Why not give the license away to some some company and cash in for the royalties?
---
*Crickets*
---
it doesn't, you're thinking map completion and map completion does give you currency always.
---
So that's what happened to the Luxons.
---
I didn't include, but I always had a wild theory, or more like an idea, that the core of Tyria is a dragon, or a elemental-like dragon that is the core :D
---
they are dragon minions, of course they were here before Humans. The ones from the Pale Tree are new though.
---
You're good. I also skimmed, which doesn't help no matter how clear the formatting.
---
It's still good choice, I think metabattle has the full build.
---
Prepurchases are your friend. If any punk can kickstarter his hobby stuff out of thin air, so can a multimillionaire company.
---
Fair. I just mean was "Jade" a reference to Cantha?
---
yep, I just noticed that now too haha
---
why do we need to make a new lvl 1-80 season 5 story?
---
all the new story episodes and content since 2013 are lvl 80, so why do we need to start over at lvl 1 now?
---
the new protagonist doesnt need to do all over the zhaitan story etc, since he/she can be anything anet wishes to be. Can be played as some guy from the pact who worked and fought under the commander, could be a member of tyrian explorers society, could be anything really.
---
What about revenants then? There were no revenants before hot, so how are you playing as one during zhaitan story?
---
there is no need to "take away the title" or take away anything. We,the players, already used our characters as different roles in the world. 
---
As a random adventurer, as a random pact member, as a random raid mercenary , as a random fractal "researcher" 
---
When i said "start fresh" i ment starting a fresh new storyline with a new protagonist we can play as. It doesnt need to be a lvl 1 storyline, it doesnt need to delete and ignore all the things the commander did , or suddenly ignore dragons ,the pact, dragons watch and the crew.
---
I know it does, just wasn't sure about the story cuz I didn't do any more than once tbh
---
It supplements income without being intrusive or taking away from other sources of gold.
---
Same. Left BFA and I’m so happy now. I loved mog/mounts in wow and the dye/skin system in gw2 is my favorite thing ever!!! I love dyes so much. It’s wonderful to have choice.
---
A lot of old accounts get hacked and used for RMT. Wait for support response and you'll have your account back. If you want to provide more info, dont submit another ticket, update old one, otherwise your ticket gets thrown back at the end of the queue.

[I've had it up to here with this not the mama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNR4hKbSH7I)
---
Man, this was great. The Episode in which "not the mama" turns into a tree gave me nightmares.
---
the heavy armor is top tier aesthetic and my daredevil cri evertim.
---
This is a joke, right? You're joking?
---
With most of the legendaries the story is that the first 2 are failed attempts to craft the legendary.
---
Girl, we are talking about fuckin elder dragon origins. Their MAIN plot of the game. They don't have it 7 years after release, not to mention first drafts from gw1. It's not deep lore, it's their MAIN STORY.
---
Just tested on DM, doesn't do it all in one.  Too big it seems.  But can do it in two.
---
Glyph of Reaping is great for flax farm, Malchor/Straits wood farm, and home instances, other than that rarely procs, havent checked that exactly but I think it has 300 range
---
The griffon costs less than 41g?
---
It's only cool if you don't know it would be 100% copy pasted from WoW.
---
I love Ayin’s videos. Whenever I’m unsure about something her videos get straight to the point. She’s also fricken adorable and her voice isn’t annoying or hard to understand.
---
the first people to start it should've finished today. i started after reset on the first day, and i'll be finishing after reset tonight (maybe tomorrow, if it takes too long)
---
Thanks for this. Hope to be able to farm these out relatively quickly
---
Did anyone else think it was a water map when they first arrived? The map hadn’t rendered for me and all I could see on the map screen was the little island with the initial waypoint. Got kinda hyped.
---
People with 1 functioning brain cell should have expected after Aurora we can expect season wide scavenger hunt including tokens from all maps with last episode.
---
Essentially yes people bitch and moan about dead maps, Anet ask you to go back to those maps and people aren't happy about that. Aren't we an amazing bunch.
---
Of course. Would be cool if the Jade Dragon was in Human form and controls Cantha.
---
I don't think that anyone cares what a weird, narcissistic, delusional roamer has to say about wvw either and yet here you are.
---
I was going to say "Shaman already did this" and then saw the pic and busted out.
---
how is that a timegate if you can farm with multiple chars and get it done in a day no problem. is me being a dedicated player P2W? (play on words: play 2 win)
---
Your pun "Broken" him.
---
If you're on NA and want an experienced player to help, send me a message! I love taking others through content.

This is just getting asinine.
---
Ayin is amazing, and not talked about nearly enough.  Glad to see a thread pointing out how great she is.
---
Conveniently forgetting Istan **was** populated 24/7. Guess why? Not because of arbitrary bullshit grind, but because its meta was rewarding. Even today, Auric Basin gets multiple full maps, again because of the rewards.
---
I think they should smooth out the water's color gradient a bit too.  That's half of why it looks so square.
---
MAY 28th?  Thanks anyway.
---
Saved me from many jp
---
Thanks!!!!
---
Daily reset happens at 02:00 UTC+2 every (real) 24 hours.
---
Tbh we need zaishen quests back, I know that daily are kinda that but it needs to be back exactly how they were in GW1.
---
Have them be a lot more rewarding than dailies.
---
Have a ”zaishen-mission“ where everyday you need to replay a different story instance, then you will have all day people teaming up to do those quick. That’s how you easily get people to redo story etc. and team up. Definitely add a hard mode with that too because why not. (I guess adding hard mode for the older stuff would mean too much rework but then implement it for future content)
---
I just want TaCO to work with GW2 Launch Buddy, after 1.6 GWLB requires a UAC confirmation which raises GWLB  and GW2 to run with administrative privileges  and causes TaCO to fail at launch
---
&gt;generally I really enjoy trying to swim in the lore of this game and sometimes try to dive real deep into things
---
Deep sea dragon!
---
Zhaitan was capable of complex war strategy and Mordremoth directly spoke to sylvari. Even Jormag seems intelligent and actively malicious. The races of Tyria really should have stopped seeing them as just forces of nature a long time ago.
---
A UI allows users to interact with an application. An API allows an application to interact with another application. This is how websites or applications can link to other websites or applications, and use information from one place for another.
---
In order for the site gw2efficiency to pull information from your account, you first have to create an API Key. Similar to how you login to your anet account with a username and password, gw2efficiency uses the API Key to "Log In" and pull data from Anet's servers to visualize the data on your account.
---
This update will allow GW2Efficiency to further distribute this access in a secure way. Because the scope of the subkey that GW2Efficiency could distribute would be limited, and the subkey would have an expiration attached, another app could use your GW2Efficiency account and access to your Anet account to pull data from that anet account. It would not allow for the entire API key access level, but distribute access in small portions as requested by the app.
---
So cute!
---
Let's not kid ourselves, it's hovering, not true flight. Not that they should ever allow true flight in the game.  
---
It's functionally just a springer that can hover.
---
\&gt; yet empty, family less  
---
 I think killing them would be a mercy for them after you got the calfs.
---
&gt;Would you do raids if there were no rewards?
---
I do wings 1 - 4 even though I'm done all 3 sets of legendary armor and 168 Legendary Divinations. 
---
Rewards are a necessary component for getting people to play. This is evident in the raiding community how hard it is to raid on Sunday.
---
The fact is that this is an MMO with an economy. The game itself incentivizes you to play content that is rewarding in some way because it is part of the greater game as a whole. 
---
Look at the dungeon scene. Since ANET nerfed dungeons pre-HoT, they killed their own dungeons. A community that once thrived, where people were running entire trains of dungeons in the game, suddenly wasted. They nerfed Arah p4 to no longer drop 5g anymore, nobody does Arah p4. 
---
Again, it's part of the game design, and not a problem inherit to raids. Very few people do Serpent's Ire for example because it's not rewarding. 
---
Would people do raids with no rewards? Most people probably wouldn't. But it's not because raids are unfun. 
---
Rewards are part of the MMO genre. A good MMO balances challenging content with good rewards. 
---
All that said, whether or not something is rewarding isn't a reason to oppose difficulty scales for the Living Story.
---
Ahh I see I misinterpreted this
---
&gt;For now, we’ve made a couple of changes in areas where players were engaging in content with competing goals. In the May 28 update, we’ll reduce the time between collection tiers from 24 hours to 2 hours, to reflect the passage of a full day in Tyrian time rather than in real world time. You’ll also be able to feed your skyscale four times a day instead of three, reducing the total number of days you need to feed your skyscale by one (assuming you feed them the maximum amount each day).
---
Omadd's machine showed the pale tree at the center of the elder dragons. Just saying.
---
People are always looking for clues/reasons that we might enter Cantha. At least for me, someone who has never played GW1 and has little knowledge of the lore it can come across as a meme of sorts.

Yes they can. You have to use Griffon with Bond of Vigor and Bond of Faith, just get out of the Altar of Murdered Dreams and stick to the right side while going up with your griffon jumping on the rocks that sticks out like sore thumbs. You should be able to fly there.
---
Yeah grenth forbid you have to play a game and do it's event XD
---
Thats because it seems like she is more detailed in her explanations of what is happening or needs to happen. Where in Dulfy’s case sometimes her videos are just left for certain parts for you to translate and figure out
---
At first I thought it was Runescape. Then I remember Minecraft has maps like that.
---
i mean thebezpansions are good and all, but nothint to get horny over.
---
You can play the TP from anywhere, pop into Obsidian Sanctum in WvW when needed for TP and bank access, then back to wherever you have your toon parked.  If an alt are next to a TP, you're short changing yourself.
---
doubt there's a way to change that without changing the actual map though, the best (and perhaps easiest, unless there's a lot of code stopping them) change they could make is matching the water color imo.
---
idk why i have to repeat myself: do it with multiple chars.
---
Answer me this. Why is HoT considered the hardest expansion by inexperienced players? PoF is a peaceful relaxing experience in comparison to HoT for players not as experienced as us.
---
I'm actually more excited to the hotfixed and future change to spirit shard acquisition.  This has been mind numbing for me trying to get them for legendary crafting.
---
This is awesome! 
---
Thanks for the hard work to make the experience in this game even better
---
Yeah, I made sure to keep at least 250 of everything because that's what Aurora required. Thought about consuming some of them since I was low on VM, but when it was revealed that the Skyscale was gated and no info on the entire collection, I held off. Would rather be safe than consign myself to farming hearts with alts.
---
I can understand getting 250 of each would be harder for people who are newer or don't play a lot, but I don't get the people who consumed all their stacks (and I do mean full stacks) an hour after this episode came out. Especially when there were still locked achievements and, iirc, people didn't know Aurora would require LW3 currency stacks until after the Henge timegate was finished.
---
Attuning is very cheap compared to infusing. I'd recommend attuning before salvaging ascended trinkets.
---
Do you know what the mists are made of? Because I don't, looking at how the piece of armour we dragged through them recently behaved I'd say say all bets are off.
---
Perhaps the pieces of the mists are drawn to each other because they don't belong on Tyria and only by being clumped up they remain stable.
---
Ive had issues with that as well.
---
gez ,u win a-net keep your damn mount , i prefer my sanity over this nosense.
---
Could we explain why it would be nonsense?
---
Given the timegates were just justified using in-game logic, is it crazy to suggest the griffon and skyscale might get at least a little extra lift in an updraft?
---
My original comment is really in reference to this vocal minority, as well. They're never happy, and they scream the loudest, so Anet sweeps in to placate them against their better interest. I don't mind the Gem store at all.
---
My vote is to add VM nodes to add maps instead. :p
---
Those recharge(at least the red ones) the green bar.
---
Ah. I've never played GW1 either, I just did a few hours worth of wiki diving and put together what I believed was the most plausible outcome.
---
I love this
---
It doesn't change the fact that it is still technically a timegate.
---
Aurora was a legendary so by definition people expected it to be grindy. The skyscale is unprecedented so it toom people by surprise.
---
I had to get my account changed over from an old msn e-mail and the issue was resolved within the week. ANet works pretty quickly
---
ANET merely responds to its playerbase.
---
^I am starting to worry that is the true reason this game has so little group content...^
---
Here comes the angry guildies to chime in wew
---
That_Shaman's version:

https://twitter.com/that_shaman/status/1130550755197366273
---
Any more so than people cared about this trash clip?
---
Kitless Holo is one of my favorite power builds to run for fracs and raids. No fuss no muss, and has some good utility.
---
I think 31k is a bit too high for sword though. You must've been looking at a kits build. Pure kitless with laser disk, photon wall and rifle turret would be around 28-29k. 
---
Either way, it's a good build to try if you want to.
---
That Shaman's version:
---
pocket raptors in a nutshell. We need pocket raptor breeders in other maps... which of course lose control and accidentally release them across the world.
---
Middle ground maybe? 100-150 map currencies would have been the best of both world imo. Just enough to bring people back to maps without driving them insane with too much of it.
---
Knew she was a reapist
---
I cant wait until it is. I played the crap out of GW2. I have a bad feeling I'm going to lose a lot of stuff. I had a decent a lot of good gear and some gold saved up. I'm sure the hacker sold/traded all of it
---
Very much this. All the players who take the time to organize HP/MP trains, WB trains (or specific WB completion/WB achieves like for Triple Trouble and Shatterer), who port people through JPs for dailies, and so much more—those are people who greatly care about the social/community aspect of the game and recognize that group play or group assistance really helps everyone in many circumstances. These players could literally be doing anything else with their time instead of standing around waiting to help random people they have no other connection with.
---
OP is right about how LFG sucks for promoting this kind of thing, and more cohesive/formal guild stuff in general. My guild is small and casual because we all have jobs and families. So, doing stuff in HoT maps (for example) isn't easy for us. We do try to do guild missions sometimes and fractals when we can but... Other than someone maybe posting a decent ad for their guild in Map chat when players happen to be around, how else are people supposed to find reliable, like-minded groups? It was by happenstance that I stumbled into an HoT map completion train that helped me immensely—simply by being in the right area of the right map when they happened to go by. And again by happenstance I found out about the TCI Triple Trouble event. How many other players would get to enjoy so much more content if group play was easier to arrange, organize, and promote, and guilds were easier to find and review?
---
&gt; Those who start now can use the time gates to get the currencies.
---
Which should have been the case for all players. No reason to keep it a surprise.
---
This meme is 6 years old...
---
It'd be nice if the unbreakable tools had more than one glyph. I want to use this for flax farm but flax gives a good amount of volatile/unbound magic per node so I'd be losing too much possible resources on maybe 30 seconds of my time.
---
Mount is quite literally the definition of 'busy work' that teachers give students when they have nothing else to give them. Blocking you from progressing due to having to wait till reset is dumb.
---
oh, so you can actually play up to lvl 80? I read something about "lvl 10" on their website and was a bit confused.
---
&gt; The game is pretty active and very much alive, but in the next couple of weeks there might not be many players in older areas because we got a new map last week.
---
will I be able to solo content if there are no other folks around or do I need a group to get the content done?
---
I don't mind solo grind and actually enjoy it quite a bit sometimes, but eventually I'm looking for group content in the long run.
---
Honestly probably the same maps? The HoT meta chains are more engaging than random 1 off events in PoF.
---
What a nice thing for you to do! May the Six bless you!
---
&gt;Now collection timegate is GW2 map time of two hours
---
ftfy
---
I set up for running multiple hearts. Thanks, btw!
---
Salvage-o-matics. After that, maybe the home instance portal stone (for quick, 'free' transport to your home city, where there's crafting stations and bank access), followed by bank space, and bag space for your main. Shared inventory slots are useful if you have items you want to have accessible to all your characters (like ... salvage-o-matics, or a home instance portal stone).
---
Bank space should probably be prioritized over bag slots (bank slot = +30 bank storage @600 gems vs bag slot _+ bag_ = +4-32 inventory _on one character_ @400 gems). You can also create a personal guild (or 5) and use the guild bank for additional, off-character storage.
---
The unbreakable tools take forever to pay off, unless the time spent replacing your gathering tools or the glyphs they come with is fairly valuable to you (it is to me, but YMMV). Ditto most of the home instance gathering nodes.
---
&gt;  Until we know more about the future I would say it's worth at least a try as a free user.
---
that's the plan currently. Some other guy said I actually can play up to lvl 80 on a free account (I thought it would be lvl 10 only) so without really knowing how fast leveling up is, I guess 0-80 will take a fair amount of time and lots of things to do.
---
Yes, tiny feet aside, I was making a counterpoint to your point and offering an alternative opinion. Using your comment, you say that it was "fun" for you to acquire the mount. Great. I'm truly happy you had fun, and I'm glad you got the feeling of accomplishment ANet was trying to put into the journey.  Just like the raptor mount we receive in the first ten minutes of the expansion, I don't think it hurts the content, or sense of accomplishment to have the mount be a celebration of the story journey we just went through. Enjoy your lunch.
---
It was so damn obvious that this will be the case after seeing what Aurora needed.
---
Give to charity, I know of a good cause that's totally not my compulsion to collect everything.
---
I use her guides all the time. Quality videos and dependable work!
---
To complain is to be human. "I'd rather devs take their time and release something thats been fully developed" ... also... "CONTENT DROUGHT.. this game is dying!"
---
That addresses the first question, I guess.
---
Because they are different and separate methods of travel, no reason to combine them.
---
that sounds cool. I'm not really a cheap gamer but...hell, I did spend so much money on games recently and ended up getting bored of those games rather fast (looking at you Anthem and TD2).
---
I guess the free account will keep me busy till August.
---
That seems like a far-fetched idea honestly. We know that the Mists are made solidly enough to pin down an Elder Dragon and walk on. 
---
Props for creativity but I'm gonna have to say nah, I highly doubt there's any lore reasoning for this and it's just one of those things. Like why Mordor is a perfectly walled off area.
---
Yeah I really have no qualms about the gem store, mount skins are their cash cow. I know this and am fine spending money to have a giant gecko or armadillo monster.
---
From the top of my head: Vigil Helmet, No shoulders, Brawn of Koda, Heritage Gauntlet, Pit Fighter Skirt annnnd no clue what the boots are.
---
whenever I checked in the mmorpg subreddit GW2 was recommended to people for being a nice game and having an active community, why would they stop caring about it?
---
But this is a mount. Not a legendary.
---
as a new player (currently downloading) what are you guys talking about?
---
Big collection after season finale.
---
They just want endless, constant content that’s obtainable instantaneously, so they can it’s too casual and should be for elitists only.
---
These people are cancerous fucks.
---
I bet they’re fucking pissed that I actually just like to play this game and not rushing screaming “reee skyscale”.
---
For the most part the game is needed for extra character/item spaces.  Also you don't get login rewards as F2P.  You'll be able to experience all the base content though.  They add extra story missions every few months to further things along and give you more to do which do require the expansions but you should have plenty to go through and play before making up your mind on it and investing in more. Doing so well net you more weapon types /skill bars to mess around with while you go through the expansions as well.
---
&gt; Maybe I'm just remembering it wrong, I'm pretty busy this month.
---
No, there was indeed plenty of "ITSAH TIMEGATE" comments in each thread on the subject.
---
Thank you because I could not find #4. Didnt check behind that tree in particular
---
Because the skyscale and the griffon are "legendary" mounts, so to speak. If most other mounts you get just as part of the story, they'd be the "exotic" mounts; the beetle requires some heavier work ("ascended") but then the griffon required a LOT of work and a lot of money ("legendary"). The skyscale is supposed to be in the same class as the griffon, they're just doing a different means of acquisition.
---
i felt that too when i saw it today :D
---
AB and TD still lol. Simple, short, map chat banter
---
Slightly unpopular opinion, but since nothing will compare to Reaper itself, daredevil comes as close as others with recent patches.  
---
Extreme mobility, stealth, evades, all help for avoiding damage in general. 
---
Staff has baller damage output. And staff 5 is an evade + big damage.
---
And some traits are very useful:   
---
Invigorating Precision (in critical strikes): Heals 10-20% of your critical damage output.  
---
Marauder's Resilince (in daredevil): 7% of power gets added to vitality, and take 10% less damage from melee range enemies.
---
You either have character model qualtiy on lowest or simply ignore all those people using outfits, mount skins, permanent gathering tools and all that shit.
---
Hmmm I hadn't considered that those currencies are daily limited.  Although your not truly limited though, absolute last case scenario in a given day would rolling a new character, doing the hearts -&gt; buy currency, finish up map completion (more currency) then delete that character.  Personally, I wouldn't do that, but people who really wana go fast might.
---
It's a long story. They added mounts in the latest expansion (Path of Fire), and some mounts have been unlockable through some collections (basically quest stuff that you do at your own pace). The latest mount has had a collection that involved a LOT of timegating stuff (basically impossible to do it in less than a week no matter what).
---
A lot of people are mad about the time gates because, while they make sense in terms of the game's context (you grow a baby dragon to its adult size), they feel like a big slap in the face (especially since the first time gate happens after the collection had you run around the same map 3 times in a row!).
---
It's not the end of the world, far from it, but it's really annoying (and the mount was definitely a big part of this release so even more annoying to be kept from it in such a way, basically).
---
Fucking true, PREACH lol, just yesterday when i was doing one of the easy JPs i saw someone say "Anet really does only want like 5% of the playerbase to get this mount, this is rediculous" I love how pathetic and whiny all the scrubs are being over a really easy meta achievement. Its amazing how something so simple can separate the fairly decent players from the scrubs that earn everything they have in the game through credit card farming and other players hold their hands through everything.
---
Well, the pre-nerf design made Istan a map that was enjoyable to spend time on.  Much like SW.  I get the feeling they want Dragonfall to fill that position for awhile.
---
looks perfect for wvw
---
Griffon can't use updrafts and that makes me 99% certain neither will be available for skyscale.
---
The thing people consistently piss and moan about, to this day, isn't Aurora itself it's the Wayfarer's Henge, which requires you to either stockpile a large amount of stones or to do all of the hearts in DM every day for over a week.
---
shouldnt have bought such a toaster
---
To be fair, they already accomplished that when they last nerfed Istan which caused players to create a season 4 meta train which is really quite profitable. It's a shame more guilds haven't caught on and try to run it throughout each day.
---
&gt; No it's an awful idea and inherently  cancerous design. It brings no benefit to the end consumer and was only  invented in the first place to service skinnerboxes and pad out  engagement numbers.  
---
&gt;The only people that its meant to benefit are shareholders.
---
No its not awful and if makes sense to wait a full **ingame** day to let it hatch/feed. Its a fucking fantasy game if they want to add some realism to a egg hatching and caring for it while it grows and not add realism to other parts they are 100% entitled to.
---
Yes with the current unpatched method it is long.
---
but you can use both gliders and mounts for branded tornados
---
\#consistency
---
Okay my bad. But point stands, a legendary item either way so how is it comparable to a mount?
---
About acquisition method: Exactly, no other mount has this kind of acquisition method so why should "anyone with half a brain cell" have expected it?
---
Last, there's a reason why I used quotes. What I meant was that relatively speaking those mounts are a lot more work to obtain than the raptor, skimmer, springer that you get in the story. I don't have jackal but I believe it just needs a saddle you can buy?
---
I hear ya.  I still don’t have the funerary box that requires this meta.
---
&gt; Okay my bad. But point stands, a legendary item either way so how is it comparable to a mount?
---
I answered it.
---
not really helpful
---
I doubt he was being entirely truthful because they knew roughly where they wanted to the story to go since at least HoT.
---
even from the beginning, Aurene was set up as a benevolent successor to the Elder Dragons. the details of what happens in between can be shifted as necessary, but the main story line - Aurene is born, Balthazar comes back to kill dragons thereby awaking some and powering others up, learn that no gods are left to directly support humans/mortals, Kralkatorrik goes bonkers and starts making power moves, Aurene has a heart-to-heart, etc. - all of these were probably finalized during the game's creation, if not shortly thereafter.
---
see, the thing about characters and organizations that the in-universe populace are still unsure about is that there's a lot of wiggle room. "we haven't decided," *doesn't mean*, "we have no idea." it means, "we have some ideas, but we have decided which one sounds the coolest and also makes the most sense because 10,000 years ago is a long time and no one alive that players have met is that old, so we're waiting until that information (the origins of the Elder Dragons) become so relevant that it must be figured out."
---
...I legit got my Mom her gryph for Christmas. I hunted down everything on her account and got it for her. Did the same for the Beetle! LOL
---
I did see a skyscale rider at the mark II Golem event last night. A charr with a funny name that I can't think of right now.
---
lol credit card farming.
---
Numpad ftw!
---
It's pretty disingenuous to act like wanting a reason to go back is contradictory to feeling that requiring a full stack of every map currency is excessive.
---
There is a way to prevent it.  You must have ppl ready to engage the forged right away.  If the demolitionist take the right path hugging the wall over the little hill he has a chance to get pulled by a the hook thing or pushed by the charging officer off the hill into the air.  You must engage the forged there and agree them and kill them asap to ensure it doesn't bug out. The demolitionist doesn't always take that hill path but if he does that's when it can bug.  The west lane also has a much rarer bug where the demolitionist gets pulled into the ground and is half submerged.  Same thing, ppl should always be ready to kill forged.
---
This type of bug happens everywhere with enemies that can pull, push, launch where you can wind up "off" the map.  It's happened to me many times fighting the Dominator in Ember Bay.  His pull 'pulls' me under the map.  I try to dodge or stay at range for his first attack at 75, 50, 25%.
---
skyscale....
---
&gt;  GW2 is all about CPU clock
---
Then I would suspect one core to be at least at 100%, but highest it goes is to 60-70% most. 
---
The game is not even using the hardware provided, which makes me suspicious. I've seen bad optimization in other games, one core running at 100% the rest idle and stuff like that, but GW2 is not even doing that
---
No you didn't? All you said was that Aurora needed map currencies so somehow people should expect to need them for a mount too. I don't understand the logic here.
---
~2 years of updates have been announced. It's not like the future of the game is up on the air completely.
---
They weren't originally working on an expansion because they were working on other projects that weren't GW2. Publisher stepped in and cancelled them, teams got reshuffled primarily back to GW2, and perhaps a third expansion is now in the cards.
---
Oh god. Oh no. I haven’t even logged in lately for fear of wanting it. LOL
---
You say I didn't and yet you rewrite the answer for your question. amazing. I edited my previous post for one last try of reaching into your hidden mental potential.
---
damn this is perfect. had a post with awkward wording and you hit the nail on the head
---
Yeah exactly. I can get 250 gold faster, doing things I actually want to do, way faster than getting 250 currencies on a bunch of maps. Let alone one map.
---
The only thing they had was Aurene's ark. It doesn't say at any point they have any coherent plan for the ore behind elder dragons which they openly admitted.
---
As someone who screws up regularly in t4 fractals its comforting hearing that people are so terrible at JPs.
---
any repeatable event in an MMO is a grind. the difference is if its fun to play while you do it. there's still a lot of variety in GW2 and you can rotate through all the activities that, at the end of the day, are still grinds.  Heck, even the seasonal event stuff is just as grindy, it just feels special because they only unlock it for a month each year.
---
A little gold would cheer me, there are many things I need now. But that's very kind from you.
---
Yup, I tried flipping a few times but I feel like i'm always loosing on it in the end, for example I crafted wings of dwayna a few days ago and put it on the tp, now there's 11 listed below mine, I feel so temped to remove it and put it back on but then I will just loose gold... That's exacly what happens when I try to flipp :/
---
I'd agree with the sentiment of the gameplay loop of open world wasn't so fucking mind numbingly god damned boring. Haven't decided if I'm gonna bother grinding out the 250 map currency or not. It honestly sounds like hell.
---
because they don't. that doesn't mean they don't know where they want to start and stop lol.
---
like, I'm writing a story (series of concept albums). I know roughly how I want it to end, and I know roughly how it begins. not enough to tell anyone, but enough to know *how* the entire story goes. the major beats.
---
Well, thanks to the people that have screamed about this, I'll have an easier time to earn the same achievement that they will already have completed under more demanding circumstances, and I don't even care about it and think the complaints are ridiculous. Thanks, guys!
---
Vb&gt;td&gt;oil meta&gt;ab leech is around 8g+materials/uni gear. You could even keep an alt parked at VB matri, keep another near iceflow and another just at AB to leech the meta when its done
---
Try a few superior rune of the warrior or renegade, or strength, etc, they flip well and its around 60s+ per flip.
---
gw2 story is the discovery of elder dragons, if they don't have the origin story for them set up, it's clear they make up stuff as they progress and nothing leads to anything because there is no plan
---
They didn't adress the aquisition at all sadly.
---
I have them functioning together currently.  The dev of dx912 made it so that they work together somehow.  I was more asking if they would function together with this manager?
---
And that's really great to hear that plugins can be enabled and disabled on the fly!  Honestly that's more important, because I can turn on and off the plugins that are temporary.
---
Imagine thinking that jumping puzzles are hard. I *have* to laugh
---
Yup I used to do Vb and Ab and even Td a few times but I always end up forgeting when the meta starts... where's iceflow? a new map or something? Also what's oil meta?
---
i have 4 alt accounts parked at vb flax farm, 5 toons each account, plus login rewards selling laurel-t6 mats and mystic coins, takes 10 minutes a day. i havent actually counted how much they make, but i'm sitting on 1600g waiting for something to spend it on.
---
You know they are talking about a recurring, sustained reason to spend time there. Not a one off collection that will leave the maps dead once more.
---
Dear god
---
What is an LS map? Inexperienced player here
---
Rip Gandara
---
No need to resort to petty insults.
---
Anyway
---
&gt;Which is a direct counterargument against your mindset that you expected certain mount aquisition from skyclaw. Mounts are not consistent in terms of that and you should have expected nothing.
---
I would argue they were consistent in a way: none of them required going out of your way to farm a specific currency with (seemingly) no use outside of a few maps. Either you unlocked them via a story or did a few collections that consisted of pretty similar things (go there, fight that and X item drops etc.)
---
&gt;Mount aquisition isn't consistent, you should at least prefer yourself for ANYTHING with last episoded that would consist of using things from previous episodes. I was smart enough to gather stack of each currency during this year and now I can only laugh at people with 0 foresight about obvious things.
---
I kinda see where you're coming from here but first of all, as you probably guesses already I had no idea what Aurora was and what it required cause as a rather new player I'm not really the target audience. While doing the season 4 story I never gave a second thought to the map currencies cause they weren't seemingly needed for anything I wanted. So, I wouldn't say it's "obvious" they would be needed for something big like **a mount that wasn't even announced until recently**
---
So, those things considered I had literally zero reason to go out of my way to prepare for this.
---
I hope this cleared my point of view somewhat.
---
Not really, just efficiency. If you don't do it in one day you'll have to find a new group each day but that doesn't take much time anyway. I'd suggest learning 6 tho, since it still gives double rewards now that it's the most recent wing.
---
3 of those are legendary items with particle effects and selectable stats.
---
The last is a single dye channel mode of transport.
---
Well, just like deer stop and stare into headlights, our hunter's prey will freeze when confronted with this bow. Truly a master of the hunt.
---
Iceflow is the south part of Thunderhead keep, and is known as oil meta - drop the south key worth around 2.5g+ on tp and takes like 4mins to kill 1 boss. Usually a tag for it and it comes after TD meta. Then u can go straight from there and leech AB.
---
Playing Devil's Advocate here, this is at most a temporary ~~grindy~~ fix, if they made a fun/rewarding meta it would be better and that's probably what the "players" meant by a reason to go back.
---
I have 2 accounts but i'm to lazy to login on my other account? how much can I be making each day from the login reward and also is there anything I can do with my other account to make gold each day like crafting or something else? :)
---
Well with your logic I guess refrigerator and wash machine are both consistent machines as they can't fly on their own. Good argument, high five.
---
What, There is another flying mount? havnet played for a while, how long time does it take in total to get it?
---
You have to repeatedly play the game to make the number of hours played go up.
---
Citation needed.
---
Oh ok, yeah I wish i could learn w6 but I can only find groups with 20+ kp.
---
Right? And not only that, but does that mean you can only get the Skyscale if you own all of the S4 episodes? I'm not playing at the moment, and reading that isn't exactly giving me the urge to install the game again lol!
---
[Yeah sure!](https://i.imgur.com/cmUR21t.jpg) [Here you go!](https://i.imgur.com/6E8y4KY.jpg)
---
ok cool I will definitely try that out, how long does it usally take to buy and sell runes?
---
Ok cool, thanks, will definitely try that out :)
---
All the mounts are, yep!
---
Until now I didn't even know what Aurora was or what it needed. I'm simply not the target audience. However I'm very much the target audience for mounts which I love.
---
This would have been a real reason for outrage. I am actually completely fine with what we have now and don't understand all the fuss.
---
Thanks you!
---
&gt; it doesn’t make sense for your skyscale to go from an egg to fully grown in a day.
---
What a cop out
---
tldr; skyscale is afk mount for masoquists
---
Are you fucking serious right now
---
My biggest gripe with the end of this episode is hat there was no explanation given for *why* Aurene is incorruptible. Vast amounts of magic corrupting the consumer is a pretty universal theme of GW2, so her breaking that trend is kind of a big deal, and there's no reasoning given for it. Also they made it sound like Kralkatorrik was only mad due to the conflicting magic he consumed, but he was hell-bent on destruction looong before any of that happened.
---
Its all about how they presented the SkyScale vs Expectations. We all expect a legendary anything to take a while. It is the way it has always been. Our expectations were all over the place, ranging from a collection or three, like the beetle mount, to included with the story. What people got was nothing like that, and it is understandable that people are upset that reality didn't meet their expectations. In the end, we will all forget the outrage. The people who want it, will see the value in it, and the others will not. I do think it will limit future players (new players) from going for it, as you will have to purchase all of the story chapters with the new areas in them to progress the collections. But you are right, the community is very reactionary to surprises.
---
&gt; Thing is the accumulation and use is pretty uneven
---
That’s one of my main problem. I have toons just waiting to do map completion of certain LS4 maps but Kourna/Sandswept only award 5.
---
Istan give chunks of 25 *per heart* whereas all other maps give 5.
---
I just wish there was more alternatives. Buying currencies in DragonFall was a step in the good direction but it should have been 15 daily instead of 5.
---
Another tip; stop buying things. I mean if you keep buying things from the vendor it'll obviously take longer.
---
If you force people to slow down on the thing they want, they'll have plenty of time to talk about it on the internet.
---
Their origins may be crucial to breaking the cycle. You cant save world until you know whats killing it  . And gw2 proves this. We went yolo killing 2 dragons almost causing global cataclysm. Research on elder dragons is crucial point leading to removing their threat.
---
RP can be grindy too. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Me: \*notices bold print\*\*Drops donut\*  
---
Me: **333g TOTAL \*Goes into cardiac arrest, life flashes before eyes\***   
---
Me:\*Looks again\* "Oh if you insta buy"   
---
Don't do that to me op. Bold both values.
---
I'm glad I'm not on this step yet but I will be soon. Thanks for the heads up!
---
Launchbuddy plugins have access to the inject method which is actually a one liner to add a .dll to a gw2 game client. So just adding d9x12 to the game would be veeeery easy. In my eyes a d9x12 plugin for Launchbuddy would make much sense if it would also automatically keep the .dll up to date for you and might also let you configure some of its stuff. (Plugins also have acces to their own UI sections)
---
So in general a plugin can almost be everything, where Launchbuddy takes of a big junk of work by providing allready coded features / management systems and additional informations which would normally be hidden.
---
I'm so dumb, I read them the exact same way without realizing what you meant..!
---
I only just experienced the full AB meta last week for achievements, and can vouch for maps filling up pretty easily. I think it's generally a neat meta, though perhaps not the most creative one. A ton of exalted chests while running pylons and after the Octovine is the icing on the cake. Plus constant banter on the octo squads.
---
No it is not a time gate, it is the butterfly from naath
---
Here's my theories on that:
---
&gt;! Death does not stop you - Aurene is not completely immortal, like other elder dragons, and will eventually die. !&lt;
---
&gt;! The magics do not torment you. They belong within you. - Aurene can tolerate  any type of magic, and further more, she can act to bring back harmony to it. !&lt;
---
&gt;! Mother - Kralkatorrik's mother was a prismatic elder dragon as well, but rather than a fixed cycle, they are only born when there is an excess of volatile, unbalanced magic. Their offspring are not prismatic elder dragons, but take on the characteristics of particular types of magic, and in that way, bring harmony to it by consuming the excess magic while keeping each type of magic separate and controlled. Furthermore, I'd wager prismatic elder dragons likely experience death when the balance of magic is restored. !&lt;
---
&gt;! I only hope, you never have to kill what you love - This may forebode that Aurene may eventually have to face and consider killing one of her own offspring in the far off future." !&lt;
---
..except that Elder Dragons were known to have existed for at least 212 years, if not a earlier in 1078AE when GW: EotN took place.
---
if you mean, like, the discovery of their *origins* then I'd also contest that by saying, in 7 years, no one in-universe has really cared *where* the Elder Dragons have come from. they've only cared how to stop them.
---
GW2 isn't about discovery, it's about events and the relationships that are affected by them.
---
Oh damn I gotta find you in lions arch!
---
&gt;it's the Wayfarer's Henge, which requires you to either stockpile a large amount of stones or to do all of the hearts in DM every day for over a week.
---
Which I did, and can vouch for it being a pain in the ass. I'm okay with some types of grind, but the timegating on that was just obnoxious.
---
What is achievement called that requires those currencies so I can look up what is going to be needed? I'm still feeding damn egg, thought it would be over after that :(
---
jesus that is the darkest timeline
---
I think they meant LW (Living World, the actual name), but wrote it as LS (Living Story, common misnomer).
---
That's a misconception. 
---
It showed the pale tree as a representation of the dream, as a gateway to go and see the "Eternal Alchemy", what Ogden calls "The All".
---
After the vision goes through the tree, it shows to the Antikytheria: 6 bright orbs surrounding another bright white orb inside a larger translucent orb with lots of tiny bright specs all over it.  
---
We know now that was a representation of the 6 elder dragons, all the magic in Tyria, and all the life in Tyria scattered around it.
---
Basically the machine used The Dream as a gateway to see The All. And that's probably why Ceara became Scarlet. She basically left the dream because of the machine, and that exposed her directly to Mordremoth, and she could no longer be protected from his influence.
---
Dont know, didnt start it myself yet, but i read sth about 250 of each mat from each ls4 map
---
Living Story map. The maps that were added as part of the living story. The latest map, Dragon's Fall, is a living story map, as you can only enter it through doing the living story.
---
A good compromise on that one would have been for each heart vendor to offer a stone for other currency (say, amalgamated gemstone) in addition to the one they offer until the collection is complete.  Give that one a quantity limit of, day... 2/d/account.  Players willing to expend the resources could then get through the gate 3x faster, but still get a taste of the intended experience.
---
Awesome work 👏
---
Wow may have been released in 2004, but GW's story has been drafted ages ago.
---
GW2's writers play the logest game ever with their writing. Remember how long it was already decided that the Sylvari were minions of Mordremoth? It was ages before GW2's alpha stages.
---
Go for it... I also originally had Lost Precipe and found it a  haven for decorating, and like you when PoF came out claimed the beautiful Windswept Haven, but it didn't take long to realise that it was a useless guild hall for decorating. So a few months later went and claimed Lost Precipice back again. It's cost 300g to get back to it, but it was well worth it.
---
Wait wait. Are you really asking how it's the players' fault that there are so many threads, and that the outrage on this subreddit was drummed up to absolutely farcical levels?
---
*Really?*
---
I think you know very well how it's the players' fault that those things happened.
---
It's because it's basically a serious RP thing for people. The ones whining most are the ones who want access to it as soon as possible, with little to no effort, so they can RP well.
---
In terms of legendaries, most of these people that are complaining about it won't even bother to make one...partly because they can't even afford to make one.
---
People like me, the ones sitting there with tons of legendaries (54 in my case; even with a full-time job, school, and other responsibilities) are not worried about skyscale requiring a little effort. We actually appreciate the thought put into (in terms of story regarding the mount) it by ANet and are in no rush to get it.
---
&gt; Anet publicly admitted that they were uninvolved with GW2 development for a while
---
Link, please? That's an odd statement.
---
Play a bit on one map, play a bit on the next, play a bit on the next. Play the game.
---
Doing dailies, doing metas, doing dungeons, doing world bosses, selling tier-4 and 6 mats
---
Bravo good sir. I laughed.
---
But it does have a little bit of tap water in it.
---
If they called it Legendary Skyscale mount then i think people would've expected it to be a long lengthy timegated process like it is now lmao. This is their way of making a mount "Legendary" . Although they are changing it on the 28th lol. Waited 2 weeks to change the time gate from 24 hours to 2 hours.
---
Give https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy a try. DirectX12 wrapper for GW2.
---
At least I don't feel the need to be a condescending prick.
---
The DF currency exchange is comical.  Thanks for the reminder on hearts and the indication of quantities for istan - three or four Astralarium runs will fill me up.
---
With sixteen characters I should be able to brute force Thunderhead in a couple days.  I hate that nap, though - the graphics and sound give me a splitting headache. 😕
---
Not true. Go into the Crystal Oasis. Count how long it takes before someone in map chat asks "hey when does the legendary facet spawn? I need it for my griffon"
---
Nobody stopped anyone from being unhappy about it. Let people make fun of how absolutely overblown the outrage became. Being unhappy is one thing. This sub did not "be unhappy". This sub escalated it from "being unhappy" to "the fires of absolute outrage". Farcical af.
---
Lead Shoes mastery
---
5. No wait 0. Maybe the zero bless you.
---
But you are.
---
By Discovery I meant study or research. Not my first language, sorry.
---
If you insist
---
TBH, the talk of "dead maps" is quite hyperbolic as well. As someone who did all LW3 achievements during the last year and in the last few months spend a lot of time in LW4 maps - there are usually enough people on all of these maps to do everything you want to/have to do. 
---
Even Kourna, which I actively dislike, had enough players to comfortably do the meta each time I been there during the last few weeks.
---
You need stuff from all over ls4 and optionally ls2 and ls3
---
I very much doubt that.
---
This is one of the things that could be done with the "cross-expansion" masteries I always wanted to reward players for getting all expansions.
---
They could all go in a single list, and require to have unlocked a certain mastery from each expansion to unlock, and cost 1 single point from each expansion to learn, and they'd be fallible with exp from either expansion. For example:
---
* Soaring Winds (Updraft Use +  Aerial Prowess) : Griffons quickly regain their endurance while in contact with an updraft.
---
* Magic Jolt (Leyline Gliding + Aerial Finesse): Griffons instantly regain all endurance while in contact with a leyline.
---
* Soothing Winds (Updraft Use +  Air Rescue) : Skyscale slowly regain health, endurance and flight juice while in contact with an updraft.
---
* Perpetual energy channel  (Leyline Gliding + Rift Repair): Skyscale no longer lose 'flight juice' while in contact with a leyline.
---
* Life Saver (Exalted Assistance + Rejuvenating Revival) : Skimmers will automatically mount when stepping on dangerous terrain such as Sulfurous Sands, Lava or Branded Spikes. (This effect will have a 60s cooldown)
---
* Tactical Retreat (Exalted Assistance + Any mount-related mastery): Can now mount while in combat. Mounting in combat disables the engage skill for 30s. (This ability will have a 240s cooldown)
---
* Stalking Sands (Nuhoch Stealth Detection + Adroit Evasion): Jackal can use the second mount ability to spend endurance to gain Stealth temporarily. 
---
* Muddy Sands (Nuhoch Wallows  + Shifting Sands): Jackal will now use Nuhoch wallows without dismounting when jumping on them.
---
* Ancient Bond (Any Ancient Magics mastery + Volatile Magic Resonance): Mounts will now regain endurance when touching Unbound Magic like when they touch Volatile Magic.
---
All those surplus points can have some use and make masteries learned in one region useful in others. And the costs would be low, so it won't use all of them and still keep some leeway.
---
&gt;  but it doesn't exactly make me excited to give them money for skins
---
Then don't.
---
Completely unusable on mobile which is a shame since I'm sure I'm not alone in following guides (ideally written) on mobile while remaining in game.
---
Probably because Mawdrey wasn’t released all at once. You worked on it knowing you couldn’t finish until later episodes were released. It didn’t matter if you finished it the day of release cos you couldn’t progress until 2 weeks anyway. That’s a wholly different scenario to Skyscale
---
And none if these can be achieved without expanding our knowledge on elder dragons
---
Dude same
---
&gt; Living World Stuff
---
Season 2 has the least. Along with the story, you're missing out on an armor set (Luminescent) and one piece of another set (Carapace), as well as a Back Piece and an item that lets you exchange Bloodstone dust for loot.
---
Season 3 and 4 each have a full PvE zone per map, so 6 per season. They have full weapon and armor sets (Plural on both), Masteries, and even a couple mounts on Season 4. As well, they're the best way of obtaining Ascended Trinkets for their respective expansions.
---
The story will make *zero* sense skipping them. You'll have no idea why you are in the areas you are, you'll have no idea who you're fighting or why, who any of the characters are, or basically anything going on. All of GW2 forms one continuing narrative.
---
&gt; Leveling
---
It doesn't dramatically change, just more stuff opens up. Dungeons every 5 levels starting at 30 for example.
---
It's just a decoy for the turtle invasion
---
Because I'd like actual content instead of a massive scavenger hunt, replaying maps I've already completed multiple times (and hearts at that), and multiple levels of time gating.
---
Someone in a guild I'm in crafted it before I had even received the patch so my client couldn't display their chat links properly at the time.
---
I’m assuming you always sell the rare ones?
---
Early game I used to get like from level 30 to level 50 just exterminating centaurs in the big event chain in the north of that zone.  Joko could build ten palaces and have bones leftover to spare in the centaurs I killed alone.
---
I mean I probably won't, but I have done in the past, and the only entity that actually hurts from this change in my behavior is Anet
---
I am poor and i disagree.
---
Think about all the good times with Zhed Shadowhoof in GW1.
---
Ohh. I’m guess it’s for the skyscale collections I haven’t gotten to yet. I just finished the newborn skyscale thing so I’m waiting for the saving skyscale part to open after reset.
---
I really feel bad for the Jotun farmers in a lot of the snowy zones.  It's got to be hard as fuck to grow those crops, and I run through slaughtering everyone just for a few extra vegetables.
---
Okay but not enjoying something doesn’t mean it’s hard
---
Keep in mind the influx of players who either quit because they didn't have the patience when GW2 was released or were raised in today's instant gratification era. Also keep in mind how Reddit's circlejerks have been feeding themselves and getting increasingly petulant.
---
To be fair, they do have precedent with Aurora. Not 100% sure if it's a good justification, but ah well.
---
Thats nice of you.  Curious, what was your biggest single item payoff?  Or was it mostly just a steady climb for you?
---
Ah that makes sense!
---
Pick two:
---
- Anet
---
- Hotfix
---
- Fast
---
Outdated?
---
Ok, go and play without it, I dare you.
---
I always mentally categorized them the same way in my head, so it's probably more intuitive than you give it credit for.
---
Dr?
---
Uhh, no. No one that is even semi-serious about roleplay would ever use a Skyscale in character because, from the story, it is completely improbable that someone that *isn't* the commander could obtain one.
---
Maybe you mean so that people can afk on it to show off a shiny?
---
Does anyone measure a range of that glyph?
---
Whoa whoa, hey, in WoW’s defence we also have a cash shop on top of the subscription. And a box price for the base game. And an additional fee for the current expansion.
---
Open then is more worth. Not only gold wise, you also have a chance to get items from a higher rarity. 
---
From a blue unid, you can get a green/gold/exo item as well. From a green one gold/exo items and from a gold unid exo items. 
---
From my experience you get 0-2 golds per stack blue unids and 2-5 golds per stack green unids (golds = golden items, not gold). Also you get an exo every now and then. 
---
So all in all you get an additional chance to get better loot, when you open your unid. Ofcourse additional chances of precoursers too.
---
Tbh saving skyscales is one of the best collections I've ever done!
---
Having an underwater mount would be nice. I don't know if the Skyscale is going to burn people on the idea of another mount but as long as it's similar to the Beetle I can see people being willing to go with it, especially if it makes getting around underwater easier for the times we have to do that. That and a multi seater for ~~dragging people around~~ helping transport people during meta's and the like are the two obvious ones I can see that are left barring any really niche type aspects they want to delve into.
---
But would you say its worth it to open the golden ones aswell? They sell for 40 gold per stack
---
Groovy. Just thought I'd confirm.
---
&gt; I don’t get to play nearly as much as I’d like, so I try to make the most of my time in game. That said, I’m super behind in terms of content. I am just now starting LS3 (yeah, I know), let alone PoF’s story and then LS4.
---
The story itself does not take very long. You should work through the solo content without stopping to do all of the metas and collections and whatever, get current so you can play the most recent content, and then cycle back to the old stuff during a time when everyone isn't concentrated on the newest map, so you'll have a shot at actually finding a group doing those metas (or starting one yourself by putting something in LFG and waiting a bit, there are always going to be more people like you who really need to redo those things or are just looking to play old content).
---
&gt; Side effect of this new forced method is that Launchbuddy creates so called SoftLinks ( something similar to a file link ) to "swap" out loginfiles without actually copying them.
---
Why not rename them instead?
---
I've got two screens at home, but i was reading this post on my phone at work which is why I felt it necessary to let people know it was broken on mobile.
---
You know, I was just gawking at the prices of a few skins I thought looked cool the other day; to see someone willing to give away such valuable items is beautiful.  Good on you OP!
---
OP knows that, it's just very slow.
---
May Aurene Bless you.
---
Thanks for the advice, I really appreciate it! That sounds like a very good idea - I’ll definitely do that!
---
Just work on it slowly, no need to rush on a mount like that as long as you have the griffon already.
---
No, no, look to the bottom right. There's a little tap water right there! Surrounded by the untapped potential.
---
True, it *could* be an important aspect, but it doesn't have to be. Besides, we dealt with half of them without knowing anything about their origin so I doubt it's really all too important.
---
Where are you getting 50 FPS? Everywhere? Only when a lot of other players are around? Can you go in the fractal lobby or the Heart of the Mists alone please and check there? I have the same CPU at the same clockspeed with a 1080Ti and get 141 FPS (have it capped there) on highest settings when I'm alone. If this is not the case for you I suspect something is wrong with your system. Please check and report back. Lower FPS in Lion's Arch or everywhere else with a lot of players around is sadly "normal" in this game.
---
1. Would bload the Guild Wars 2 Appdata folder as they have to bee stored there
---
2. You have a state where the Local.dat file is actually missing
---
3. Gameclient can lock the local.dat file in future gw2 updates and prevent renaming etc. (also happend a few times during debugging)
---
So a worse time gate makes it better? If players had logged in Tuesday and found out the skyscale could only progress so far and they had to wait two weeks to finish, everything would have been ok?
---
We both know that's total BS.
---
An unpopular opinion may not be a bad one, as long as it's well explained.
---
You do realise that what really stoked the fire is that Anet said we could have the Skyscale on 14th? Sure, there would have been some pitchforks if anet had told us beforehand there was a time gate, but not as much as they did receive in the past week
---
I'm glad someone has posted this -- I've had a theory rattling around for months that I figured was too nuts to see the light of day. Gonna whip it out when I have time to format the Wild-Eye Miller
---
Also, it looked like she was going southwards, soo maybe Cantha??
---
They took over 3 years to fix necro minions AI(they used to be very unresponsive and buggy) and i believe something like that would take priority over some skin lol
---
Does it require Chalice of Tears?
---
Something you said about how people expected mounts to be easy to attain sparked a memory from my days in psychology.
---
There have been studies done where peoples are given things for free for, say 3 months. And at the end of those 3 months they made people pay for them, say, $10 per item. They also did one where people were required to pay $20 and after 3 months the price went down to just $15. 
---
Funny thing is, the people who got something for free FLIPPED SHIT when they had to start paying for the items, while the people who had to pay double and then dropped down to 1.5x as much as the others said they were satisfied with the situation on the whole and appreciated the markdown.
---
This is simply a part of human psychology. If you create an expectation, humans will ONLY be happy if their expectations are beaten, and they will NEVER appreciate the value of something if costs increase, even if they know that originally they got it for free and can rationalize that they understand the free deal couldn't last forever.
---
Oh and when they brought the prices for the second group back to $20, they too flipped shit, so it's not just with free items either.
---
My PvP guild died the moment anet thought it should ban groups from pvp, because people complained about them. No one stopped them from joining a PvP guild too. Now there are tournaments, but these weren't there for over a year when anet made the change and these people won't come back now.
---
Knowing and internalizing are two different things.
---
We're all here cause we can enjoy the fantasy adventure trope to some degree but many imagine that as just slaying a big monster, and not making difficult moral choices where you kill some of a species and talk peacefully with others of the same kind. But if there is to be any sort of story, it means doing the latter... 
---
To work for the greater good, you must be willing to decide what qualifies as a lesser good that is okay to neglect.
---
Some dungeon recipes have been bugged since September 3rd 2013. Anet just don’t care about bugs that only peripherally affect gameplay
---
Take a dedicated extra healer class, preferably with easy access to blocks/stab/condi cleanse. Firebrand works very well here. You pretty much just afk and press your utilities if needed, then throw the slubling to another player (usually a chrono because they are support class and not too reliant on weaponskills) who throws it right back to the healer. Repeat this every 20s and you're good to go. Just make sure to communicate on voice, it makes it soooo much easier.
---
And, since the layoffs, Anet saw that NCSoft only really liked them for their cash cow GW2. As such, they've redoubled their focus on it and abandoned a bunch of those side projects.
---
Which mounts?

Can confirm that it is bugged! Did all Kryta rifts and achievement is still 0/5.
---
ouch
---
That is good to know I will make some troubleshooting page
---
Same. I personally am happy that so many people are back in those maps (including me). Just because I didn't have a reason to be in those maps, it never meant I didn't like them (Except for Kourna).
---
I agree with this. They have to make money. Though I do not like the cash shop model it seems most people love it over subscription. It's fine but this comes with the territory I guess. They do have great art though.
---
I suppose that's why Anet is changing the time-gates for skyscale to just 2 hours (1 tyrian day).
---
Really? Last night there wasn't a single group in LFG for istan meta which I read was a good way to get the currency for the portal scrolls
---
Why does that thing sound and look like pepe?
---
Because you’re raising what is basically a Dragon from an egg to a rideable mount
---
:(
---
Astralaria collection is much worse than skyscale
---
And if they're theoretically pulling from Mesopotamian mythology, that could be telling that they wanted to look for something that felt truly ancient.
---
no there are clearly turtles flying sideways in the air
---
everyone missed the giant asterisk next to that
---
yes, you can have the skyscale. in the map. from the designated rental kiosks.
---
though i did see a commander hovering in la with one last night
---
What I said must have been quite complicated to comprehend in order for you to reply with this.
---
i kinda wish the orbs could be disabled. it's one of the only things keeping me from making it.
---
I agree, variety is good in it of itself assuming they all feel and play distinctly
---
Can't argue with that
---
You can use a program like GW2_Launchbuddy to easily launch multiple accounts. In 28 days you get 20 mystic coins (~20g), 55 laurels assuming you choose the chest of laurels from the last day (~33g), a couple crafting bags and an exotic piece of equipment (~2g, more of you get lucky). That's over 600g per year.
---
If mystic forger is a daily, that's worth doing. On my HoT-only alt account, I have one character parked at VB Matriarch and one ready to loot a chest after Octovine for quick and easy amalgamated gemstones (1.5g each). If dailies are extremely easy (vista, gathering, mystic forger, maybe PvP kills or WvW monuments), I might take the 5 minutes to do those for the extra 2g.
---
It's not anywhere close to what it used to be atleast.
---
There are a few thief animations I'd like to point out but idk if it's going to make a difference. So far as I can tell, thief has a unique animation set that hasn't been changed since release.
---
I’ve noticed other oddities with the thief animations as well, but I figure anet has more important things to focus on. I’ll mention a couple that stick out to me just for the sake of this post.
---
Charr thief dagger 1: toon is essentially vigorously punching the target directly in front of them while accidentally slashing everything in a semicircle to their right. Compare this to Charr spellbreaker dagger 1 which has a much cleaner slice animation which visually strikes everything in front of the toon but is only designed to strike once, as per skill description. This means there is no cross-body attack animation as the arm retreats across the toon’s torso. Charr thief dagger 1 would need a complete rework to fix it seems.
---
*And if I’m nitpicking*:
---
Humanoid female (and male?) dagger 5, “cloak and dagger”: dagger spins 360° up into the default reverse grip edge in (RGEI) before striking, essentially meaning (keep in mind this is fantasy) that the thief is stabbing in a backwards, and sideways motion across the upper torso using their off-hand... This is a huge waste of energy for an already costly attack; why a dagger combatant would expose and present their arm ligaments across the upper torso like that is beyond both me and the scope of fantasy, but I digress. 
---
To keep the style points, I’d suggest the humanoid thief would be better off spinning the dagger 540° to something like a forward modified saber grip edge out before striking the retreating arm across the torso, granting them more reach with the weapon and at least the chance to slash at the opponent’s eyes with the tip of the weapon moving in a much quicker slicing motion. I’m equating blinding the opponent to the stealth which is granted in game upon a successful strike.
---
To be fair, the Charr thief does something similar to this with dagger 5. There is no dagger flip, however a 180° turn of the dagger into a forward grip does occur, and a quick 180° dagger flip back to the default RGEI happens after the ‘slash’ portion of the animation ends, which is ok.
---
Also, without scouring Vimeo for animation reels, I’m pretty certain thief skill animations for each rig were all done by different animators, so it’s probably difficult to go back and change them now since it’s been so long since release. 
---
Overall, I think thief dagger animations just need a little love, but like I mentioned before anet probably has other stuff to work on ;c
---
Where do you purchase karma versions?
---
_**Hey it's me, your friend.**_
---
What exactly is bugged about it?
---
Bear in mind that the Elder Dragons are represented as major parts of the balance of the Eternal Alchemy. To have an origin for one of them would definitely clue us into their nature, PLUS it would set the stage for us understanding the world as it was LONG before our current earliest records (the last Elder Dragon rising).
---
They'd be hard pressed to give an origin for one Elder Dragon without wildly affecting our understanding of all of them, and the world itself.
---
Currency better than timegate. xD I ain't mad about this.
---
I did PoF story, then HoT when I came back. HoT is a lot smoother with the mounts.
---
Lost Precipice is the most beautiful guild if you decorate correctly (and even if you don't) and Gilded Hallow is sooo ugly imo. I don't understand why people don't pick this one more often, honestly.
---
Its main purpose where there aren't good substitutes are climbing some walls that weren't expressly designed to go up.
---
Skyscale not only 'jumps' higher, but can combine that verticality with a lot of lateral movement (which you can kludge with springer, dismount mastery, griffon) and a lot of precision movement (which doesn't have a substitute and allows you to jump up onto ledges that a springer would bonk its head on).  I have brute forced up a bunch of cliffs in the game already using springer and griffon on toeholds, and skyscale is going to make that a whole lot easier and open up even more routes.  This isn't really necessary when climbing along the intended paths, but will open up shortcuts. 
---
Its biggest upside will come into play on new maps.  Once you know a map well and how to get around on it you can stick to the main paths and waypoints, and use the speedster mounts to get where you need to go.  When first exploring and figuring out pathing though I bet the flexibility, especially with the ability to hover and get your bearings, is going to make exploring a new map a whole lot easier.
---
It took me a while of wrestling with the idea in my head before I just checked the wiki for the "complete" story of Joko as evidence has come together.  It's not just that Joko was a compulsive liar, he was perhaps the most brilliant tactical usurper in Tyrian history.
---
More importantly, the proposed timeline suggests that Joko was around during the Pretender Wars, in which countless rulers were trying to contend for the throne, each claiming to be a lost heir to the Primeval Dynasty. It makes sense that Joko would become obsessed with such a title at that time, and lying would eventually be natural for him. Given how, being an undying lich and all, he's the last survivor of the Pretender Wars, it just gives his claim all the more weight, since there's no one left to argue against him.

&gt; Downed Teammates available for tab-targeting
---
Depending on your definition of "tab-targeting"...
---
If you're asking for downed allies to be lumped into the same group with enemies and targeted with the same hotkey, then hell no.
---
If you're asking for hotkey targeting of allies to prioritize downed allies, that would be fine.
---
After a careful second analysis our research team has concluded that we concur. Good find, good find. xD
---
I get the feeling that the Kralkatorrik's Mother could be the multiversal transition point for the lore.
---
Kralkatorrik entering and consuming the mists is a little odd considering that the mists were supposed to be the plane that connects to and is source of everything; and while it certainly justifies the Six leaving, where exactly did they go?
---
There must be some sort of multiversal container plane "above" the mists, and I get the feeling that's where we'll eventually encounter "Mother", who will take on a motherly role not to only Kralkatorrik and potentially the other dragons, but also Tyria itself and potentially numerous other realms outside of Tyria and it's six spheres.
---
Wait, what did they do to the old maps?
---
&gt; Maybe they could add a target ally hotkey.
---
Not sure if you're trolling, but I'll go ahead and mention that it already exists. Go into the game options and assign a hotkey to it. On my game, Target Nearest Ally is bound to CTRL-C and Target Next Ally is bound to CTRL-TAB.
---
You complete a rift and it doesn't progress the achievement
---
If the hammer is configured the same as the tactivator levers in WvW, it's already targetable as an ally. You just need to bind something to *Target Next Ally*.
---
same lol ....want to get the gryph , and now working on skycale but now i need to burn the few Golds i had in the damn food ....and that isnt the last thing , toys and toys and lamp later on &gt;&lt; ugh , gw2 is the first mmorpg that i feel poor (well FFXI but thats was the norm)
---
You need multiple runes to open the doors, right? It starts with needing one rune to open a door, and then the next room needs two runes and so on. You can only carry one rune at a time. Is there another way I missed?
---
Gemstore skins.
---
I'm out of the loop, can someone fill me in on the meme?
---
Masteries in each expansion don't rely on or really interact with each other. (exception being the newest map) 
---
Feel free to go ahead.
---
That's what stopped me as well. I'm not in the habit of swapping all my stats around constantly. Plus with Ascended accessories being so cheap I can just grab more in the new statline that I want if a new better statline comes out eventually with next LW or whenever the next expansion happens. It's a cool thing for people to work towards, it's just not something that appeals to me.
---
FFXIV is most definitely worth the subscription even if you don't think so.
---
Yep, I stated this under food, I also gave the option to buy of the trading Post.
---
Yeah. I was kinda hoping this is what was going to happen at the end and not some charged leather saddle or something.
---
Yeah, those centaurs were pretty cool, until they got wiped out by Joko.
---
I know, but why the cards with the waterdrops on them?
---
i think the worst part about this who thing is ls4 maps farming
---
Dude, don't lie. People were angry just as much as they are now. Just because it happened so long ago, doesn't mean that it didn't happen.
---
No, thank the four.
---
Fair enough. My reasoning was a bit off upon looking back. The Skyscale has its evade frames reserved for example, so it'll be much easier to cross terrain with lots of anti air.
---
It will have its niche(s), the rentals are just too limited in and of themselves.
---
Skyscale collections have you going to core, PoF and LS4 maps... Part of the last collection apparently has you collect 250 of each LS4 map currency.  
---
Nothing was actually added to or changed about any of the maps AFAIK.
---
I did that a few times, for character slots and once for a cosmetic.  Since they clamped down hard on the gold supply it hasn't been feasible for me, though.
---
Warframe does something similar though it's structurally entirely different - players create Platinum (plat) by buying it with real money.  They then trade it to other players for rare drops.  It's possible for players to amass plat without paying for it themselves, though it requires a lot of grind.
