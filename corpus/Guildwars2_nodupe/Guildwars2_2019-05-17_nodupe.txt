Tyria could literally explode for all I care now, and I would be more than happy if the 1st to.die were the dam skyscales
---
---
---
People are being forced to wait behind time gates so they can actually play the content.  Really not that difficult to comprehend.
---
It looks rather cheap and ugly, too. And reused animation. You're literally grinding with the expectation in mind to get good skins in the future, because sure as hell the base version isn't worth it
---
Honestly gw2 needs to start competing with these hardcore MMOs and leave it’s current state of only being played for a few weeks every 3 months. It’s such a good game, but I fear they’ve wasted much of the potential it had
---
is this a troll post or something?
---
it wasn't even hard the first time arround.
---
Wanting to play the new content instead of waiting on time gates equals having everything handed over on a silver plate to you?
---
I love his little stompy legs
---
So with the timegates, I have time to spare to type this up.
---

I have been doing it more slowly, since when I found out today about the charged quarts needed, I only had 1. (I donated almost all of mine to a guild since I thought I didn't need them anymore. HAH)
---
I actually enjoy collections.
---
It's fun to go out and niche things in the world you never would be doing otherwise.
---
Probably and unpopular opinion tho.
---
Yea I'm in the same boat. Although I actually like the mount quite a lot. Dragons are my favourite animals, so I'm a little biased haha. 
---
I don't mind putting the effort into unlocking things. I'm usually very patient. I can only play a couple hours every few days, so I usually expect these things to take awhile. If it took a month to unlock and was actually an enjoyable process, I wouldn't have a single complaint. 
---
I don't know how they thought running around the map three times over and over pressing "f" would be a fun time. Then to have wait on top of that. Did they not play test this and get opinions before releasing what is potentially the most boring and tedious collection they could have thought of? Does the person or people who design this collection even play the game?
---
I think a large part of it comes from the inconsistency with prior mounts. They hyped this thing up and didn't tell people this was supposed to be a largef process to get. I bet a lot of people probably based their expectations on mounts we've gotten in the past. I know I did. I honestly went in expecting this to be like the beetle/warclaw. I was shocked to see it was the beetle collection x10.
---
I'm hoping the next parts of this collection are better than the first ones. I'm trying really hard not to judge this collection too hard until I actually finish it. It feels pretty bad so far though.
---
Please, leave this mobile crap out of Guilds Wars 2. Timegates like this are used to hide how little content this LS introduced.
---
Thats not what MMOs are about, congrats you're one of the dumbass that Blizzard markets to.
---
stop whining XD
---
I totally agree with you, I was just saying that there were a few situations in which timegating is somewhat excusable. This whole situation is not one of those.
---
It's complicated: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gathering#Respawn_rate
---
Most quartz nodes operate under standard "a few hours" reset. home node resets at daily reset. I believe the rich vein in the Queen's lair in Dry Top is a 23-hour node, but there's a slim chance I'm misremembering and it's a special node that resets hourly so you can harvest it every sandstorm.
---
I seriously don't understand why everybody is so mad about the timegate. It's not like any of you would stop playing Guild Wars within the next two weeks, so why not get some extra incentive to log in every day?
---
Of course the achievements aren't perfect. Like having to complete multiple collections in the same map was pretty annoying. The second day, going all around Tyria on the other hand was really fun and I also adore the day 3 collection where you have to collect food and toys.
---
The Charged Quartz recipes are, in my opinion, a good way of giving players a choice between "spend some money" or "be dilligent". It's not like you get forced to buy the things off the TP.
---
The only thing that sucks is that we're not earning any exp from PoF maps. I assume that will be fixed at some point...?
---
Good one
---
collection still the most intersting part about the game
---
You can in this case actually ;)
---
Must be nice being in a winning server
---
Time gates are for one thing and one thing only, to force you to log in every day.
---
t4 fractals is pretty easily 20+ gold per day just doing dailies
---
Perhaps it's less about accessing newer areas, but just having alternative ways to get there that may or may not be faster or more convenient.
---
If memory serves me right, an episode costs 200 gems, which would equal to about 70 gold.
---
It's doable.
---
It’s the luminous set from the sixth anniversary gift.
---
I think the way they have it is perfect. It encourages people to play the meta events. And just doing the final meta push gives you almost enough keys to open all the chests that spawn at the landing pad. You also get 1 key per champ you kill, so you can even open chests later if you want.
---
You are the bomb diggity! Lots of people will love you for this.
---
same with me
---
dito
---
Amazing! Thanks so much!
---
I don't disagree that time gates suck, I disagree with the smooth brained overreaction that GW2 Subbreddit ALWAYS does when something they don't like happens.
---
same. cant log into any char. 
---
dced from suns refuge while taking my skyscale collections....
---
Happens every reset now that people are porting into sun's refuge.
---
Same.
---
literally whatever you want

&gt; Hi everyone,
---
&gt;
---
&gt;I wanted to provide a brief update after talking to various developers. We’re aware of the concerns expressed in this thread. The team is currently regrouping and we’re aiming to communicate more about this topic as soon as we possibly can.
---
&gt;In the meantime, we're pushing a hotfix that will include hiding the skyscale Mastery line for players who have not acquired the skyscale so that they will continue to gain Mastery experience toward acquiring Spirit Shards.
---
&gt;We're also working on another hotfix coming later that will alleviate issues with finishing the Skyscale of Ice achievement in Frostgorge Sound by making the Corrupted Ice Elementals near the Claw of Jormag event respawn regularly. These creatures can encase you in ice and progress the Skyscale of Ice achievement. This is a temporary fix until we can get something more permanent.
---
&gt;Thank you for your understanding and patience.
---

---
i saw a post from an ANET employee recently and apparently it's always been the case, it's just not explained very well (or really, at all)
---
i have to imagine it was an oversight.  basically, i can't fathom how or why this was done on purpose, especially since they went back and hid the raid masteries some time ago so people who don't raid could finally start getting exp in HoT areas.  it absolutely should be hidden until the point you actually finish the Skyscale achievement track and actually can start getting exp for it.  i'm not that worried about the timegating actually, but i think the locked exp is actually a bigger issue.  i doubt they'll do anything about the timegating (given how they handle so many collections), but i predict they'll fix the mastery track at some point
---
This is why you don&lt;t timegate content to reset+ make it into personal instances. The servers can't handle this load and it shows.
---
There isn't one.
---
Yep....
---
 Long loading screen in suns refuge and when it loaded I was dc. Now I can't log with any character.
---
My guess in the layoffs. The story feels cut short, like content was removed or unfinished, same with the meta, so I imagine they gated the fuck out of the Skyscale to pad out game time on the new map.
---
Seconding all of this. You'll get the final episode of Season 4 for free just for logging in once you get Path of Fire. The other ones you can buy in bundles for a discount.
---
fractals community on suicide watch
---
VB's verticality is impressive. The rest struggle to work that in enough. Yes, AB has verticality, but there's not too many different levels (a minimal canopy mostly near the start and then basically a ground level). TD has some layers, but they're so confusing that it doesn't work well with the map. And DS is almost entirely flat.
---
Are you butthurt about time gates? Because that's probably what is blocking you from knowing how anyone could make a post like this.
---
You too?! Just me, in the corner, the third wheel, raising a hand awkwardly.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if the number is around 10-15%. A lot of people are feeling that timegate thump them in the face and becoming very discouraged. They may find the scales in a couple of days, but finish the whole legendary-like process? Probably not.
---
gettin those hard "rawr xD" vibes

lol, just about to loot my 2nd frac chest too!

---
Yeah, can't log on any character now.
---
Yup, dead here too
---
Same experience.
---
LAME NO KARMA FOR U CEREAL
---
Been 3 days and people are upset they don't have all the new stuff? I haven't even had time to log on. :(
---
That's the part that's really bugging me-- the fact that all this crap you're doing to get the skyscale counts for NOTHING. If you could put that XP toward mastery of the skyscale, it wouldn't be so... punishing.
---
Glad to see they are fixing the XP problem!
---
I don't agree with the timegate, however, it's so deeply attached to each step of the collection it will not be an easy and fast fix. Don't expect anything to be done about it.
---
 Thank you for your understanding **and patience**.
---
You're the real MVP here. I have no desire to write this up myself. I am just typing up what YOU wrote.
---
longer if you have to charge your own quartz.
---
When I saw the second timegate I was so demoralized that I nearly closed the game instantly.
---
It's a pretty good indicator ;)  
---
Considering in-game and here I've only seen contempt (only 2-3 of people like you posting on reddit, 0 ingame) I'm gonna go ahead and bet that this is, in fact, the majority opinion.   
---
It was enough to make it a sticky :\^)   
---
Where you got the idea from all the complaints by veterans and casuals alike that they are enjoying it, I have no idea.
---
Brilliant asymmetrical plays. This commander is both talented and handsome.
---
I'll be honest, at this point I hope the time gates make it so no one can unlock the skyscale until after the 24th. The salt in that stream would be a thing of legends.
---
huge and empty, a real desert i guess
---
True that it wasn't directed towards anyone, but it is disrespectful to those who don't have that time. Additionally we also have the mega thread going on and that's part of the reason why so many posts about the mount are being removed.
---
I guess I'm basing on that on the number of people I see in map around me as I do the collection. People ARE doing the collection, and WILL get over their butthurt the second they get the mount unlocked. This will all be forgotten in a month.
---
Both griffon and beetle took me 1-2 days and I didn't encounter any timegates unless waiting for a world boss or a meta event counts (which is in no way comparable to the skyscale bullshit).
---
For starters there's apparently some charged crystal thing that can take *22 days* unless you buy stuff from the trading post for price that has skyrocketed for obvious reasons
---
For anyone coming into this thread currently, they have stated they're releasing a patch to fix this specific problem (and are working on the others)
---
I never fails to amaze how when you want to do everything better or faster, you are rushing and are elitist. But don't you DARE say anything about somebody barely playing or doing everything extremely slowly.
---
You moderate a subreddit, not the United nations, but ok
---
Nice to see some communication.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The comment regarding 'encased in ice' one? Sure but that is literally the easiest thing just go to Bitterfrost Frontier and there's a million of those annoying things just waiting while berry picking - "HAHA IT'S TIME TO STOP".
---
Patch Notes:
---
&gt; On Living World maps, characters under level 80 no longer have a chance to receive a Black Lion Chest Key as part of their map completion rewards.
---
Like I said, no problem gating the higher level masteries behind the collection, but let me earn XP and have the basic mount already!
---
Allowing us to get spirit shards again goes a long was to make me feel less pressured to finish everything as quickly as possible and relieves some of the anxiety with time gated stuff. Glad they are listening.
---
It not only adds crystals though, it adds a bunch of detail in general. I think op is asking for the upgraded set with NO crystals, but with all the details that the base set doesn't have
---
What they should be doing is making some worthwhile content that is re-playable. At this point LWS is like mini-WoW xpacs.   
---
You play it and then wait for new shit because the current shit doesn't last long enough.
---
Huh, I got the ice achievement in the night event at bitterfrost frontier getting in those little ice tornadoes, super easy.
---
Oh I gave up hope on that years ago.
---
At least we got Monster Hunter World on PC, though, right?
---
It's good to see that they are allowing us to gain spirit shards before unlocking the skyscale.
---
It's for people without Bitterfrost unlocked.
---
Lol
---
They are fixing it. Anet posted on it.
---
Can anyone confirm BL keys are back for map completion?
---
thank you for this
---
but that'd require another episode to be bought for some people
---
The patch hit less than two minutes ago, friendo. Chill.
---
Another thing people don't mention is that there are also skyscales littered around the new map that you can 'borrow' and fly around with. They're pretty liberal with placements too.
---
Well there was only 2 routes they could've gone with the TP to Friend: The change they made(rip extra chance at key on key farm chars) or remove the item. The problem is this item at its core is very exploitative. Sure, this one issue got fixed but what about the next one that will eventually pop up? To me, *at minimum* the item should be a 1 hour CD that is account wide.
---
Have a question regarding the grow lamp and food for the third skyscale collection.  Do I actually need the grow lamp immediately?  Seems like I'd be best off waiting until the fourth day of feeding to get the lamp when the price might have gone down a bit.
---
Good update. Hope we'll see some changes to the time gating but this fixes the biggest issue of days/weeks without earning XP on PoF maps.
---
Also really like the map completion fix. Great way to fix it without hurting the endless teleport to friend.
---
I decided that I would rush the mount and never touch the damn map ever again, not even with a very long, long stick.
---
I'll be back to full time WvW, screw PvE! ... Once again...
---
Fractals are a chore now, dungeons are barren, open world is unrewarding x3 (2 blues + 1 green, diminishing returns, BS events), raids are filled with elitists asshats, achievement points are a joke and (even no so shinny) shinnies are heavily time gated.
---
So basically, going by this, it's a choice between aids and cancer?   
---
Neither are good and this all could have been done way better with PLENTY of excellent suggestions from players that don't involve either. Also you are gonna be spending a decent chunk of gold, just sayin'
---
Behold my viper rings I get from mining my home instance nodes every day
---
All I thought while seeing Kralk fall in the cinematic was "holy fuck did we made another tsunami that will wipe out LA?" followed by "Oh fuck what about Bubbles?"
---
The grow lamp is not the rage worth as some here is trying to make it be. And comparing it to the nullifications sigil is pretty silly since the lamp you can either farm and craft for your self or buy it from the trading post for around 10% of the Nullification price back then. 
---
The Nullification sigil had no farming method except for leveling to 64 by self or with tomes. For a loooong time it was not even possible to craft it, So at least compare with something that make sense.
---
looks like it
---
Sky scale complaints should be directed towards the stickied thread.
---
Right now it is 8 days minimum assuming you have the required materials for Day 3 as those materials are also daily timegated though you can buy the items off the TP to avoid the timegate.
---
No one is on the 4th or 5th collections yet and those may have their own internal timegates.
---
We have a megathread up with guides and other information about it: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bpf9p9/megathread_skyscale_collections_information/
---
Griffon isn't timegated, it takes a few hours with a guide.
---
I think this is for people who don't have access to bitterfrost.
---
Take your own advice.
---
????????????????????????????????
---
But just think of the Reddit karma...
---
So do something else on the meantime? It's not the only bit of content in the game...
---
&gt;no functional way to descend without pressing 1
---
There actually is. I was very frustrated because it took me a while to figure it out, but just like the beetle there's a hidden "skill". Whatever you bound your mount skill 2 to is the descend button.
---
Okay then
---
1) Just because something has happened before does not mean it is repeatable on short notice.
---
2) black lion chest keys not dropping from map completion is in no sense of the word a 'problem'.  Not being able to get map completion is absolutely a problem.
---
Mists go wayyyy beyond just the god's realms. You have the Hall of Heroes for example.
---
Oh like everybody forgot and forced anet to change their approach for way minor designs? Sure ;)
---
Thank you very much!
---
What's the story behind the no-keys-for-sub-80s thing?
---
Ikr. I saw an entire map chat get so demoralized they poofed when I told them about the feeding part.
---
One dude saw checked his charged quartz crystal count. Said nope and was gone.
---
I don't have to convince you. I'm right whether you believe me or not. Just wait and see.
---
yes; just in terms of content (materials, ascended stuff, loot, LS3&amp;4 give better RoI; I wouldn't discount LS2 for lore; it's a big deal.
---
The thing is, *they are.* I myself have reported like half a dozen of these threads today (low effort/value since there doesn't appear to be a "stuff that belongs in a megathread" option for reports) and they ARE getting deleted, for the most part. It's just... there's so fucking many, because every single person thinks that THEIR complaint is the one that deserves its own thread.
---
Legends tell of the friend of a friend of a cousin of a cat that got it, but in reality they don't drop at all.
---
Still, is a nice story to tell kids before they go to bed.
---
At least understand what you're trying to argue before you spout stuff. the grow lamp is from dry top, available to everyone.
---
It's already been a trend. They're well on their way to turning into EA.
---
Ah yes, the Scrying Pool.
---
My point was the only map with good verticality is VB and the rest are meh. A lot of S4 maps have actually had better verticality than most of HoT (Dragonfall being the most obvious of these).
---
yeah; just don't know how Hall of Heroes would fit into the story; while wrapping up that piece of Balthazar story in a raid wing would be able to do it justice while still providing non-raiders a place to "wrap things up" (see the cinematic in Bloodstone Fen showing the narrative of the Forsaken Thicket)
---
I'm not sure exactly what fixed it for me, but I decided to do a few things to help my computer out before attempting to reinstall the add-ons. I used CCleaner to clean out my files and fix up errors in my registry, then I updated my Nvidia driver. For some reason after that I reinstalled everything and it now works fine? Computers are weird man lol
---
I'd suggest giving that a shot first since CCleaner is free, double-check updates on your Nvidia drivers, and then try a clean install if there is an update waiting for it
---
Just curious but does the snow troll attack that also encase you in ice work?
---
It also requires HoT
---
i actually kind of like the skyscale care step and dont mind the core timegating it has (charged quartz being a factor in that is frustrating though, and timegating the previous steps as well was just fucking stupid)
---
the meta is good, but the map i think is pretty shitty, functionally it serves well; i just that designwise i fucking hate it after that waterfall achi (because the waterfalls are bad; something i wouldnt normally pick up on -why i enjoyed watching josh foreman on extra play, because he did pick up on those things-... but highlighting them ruined the whole thing for me... also the fucking fire in FoW, make it actually damage us or something)
---
Maybe just because im older or just because the mount is basically Rabbit+ but...
---
I feel like the 1 person that has been taking my time with the collection.
---
That being said time gates are bullshit.
---
i would state that while yes the scavenger hunt is nice the locks of how people can do it is at he annoying part. time-locks are not fun cause its an arbitrary stop sign pop up when anet has teased this mount for how long now? unlock the timegates and keep everything else and i can garente no one will bitch.
---
It's the same tack they took with the Sunless weapons. I actually quite like it since it's a nice opposition to Tequatl's shadowed and diseased effects on its weapons.
---
The other birthday suit
---
Ahh, gotcha. The way it was written was a little confusing.
---
People could use the TP to friend and TP to bloodstone fen, complete the map on a level 1 character for chance of keys - faster than doing the level 10 story. With the cd of the unlimited TP to friend being character bound, people could just remake characters and map complete endlessly
---
That depends if you grinded enough to have good items if you were just using exotics. I remember being new and getting so close but not having quite enough dps to get through it in time.
---
Oh no. I've only done episode 3 and 6. FUCK.
---
People were using the unlimited use TP to a friend to warp newly made level 1 characters into Bloodstone Fen, completing it, and getting keys. This takes like 3 minutes and was pretty easy to farm, even with the 1 hour cooldown on the item (which might be circumvented by adrenal mushrooms? IDK.)
---
This change means that characters can't be newly minted and mad dash through the map to get keys.
---
I only complain because it means leveling naturally over maps will no longer get you keys now, which does suck for new players and players who want to level naturally with map and story. A slightly more elegant fix would be nice, something like you can only get keys from a map that you are at or exceed the level cap of, or something like that.
---
I think these are fantastic. Free ascended weapon + decent skin = has to be high RNG.
---
Yep, can't get in to do my timegate. Thanks anet!
---
so just removing the time gate wouldn't be enough for make you want this mount, is that what you're saying?  Or would removing the time gate but keeping the effort the same keep you playing?
---
i got a warn not too long ago too for asking a question about time-gated achievements in the thread "ask us questions about this episode"
---
this forum is just fully censored
---
Yep. I got disconnected inside Sun's Refuge and couldn't log back in on that character for like 10 minutes. It kept saying I lost connection and closing my game.
---
Seems to work fine now, though.
---
THIS IS WHAT YOUR CURIOSITY GETS YOU!
---
Good news is they fixed that in a patch about 25 minutes ago now, so that's one bad thing off the list at least.
---
Is that a baby skyscale or are you just happy to see me?
---
I don't know if we need a single big baddie during this period for personal story since we literally just went back to back to back with balth, joko, and kralk.  I think build-able/foundation plot threads can be explored in this post-Kralk period which seems to be painted for moment as a time of relative peace compared to what we just had.  S2 was entirely a Morde story build up period, story wise it would be nice to return back to that kind of pacing where we discover and deal with conflicts but we aren't introducing and then straight up defeating a big threat over the course of 0.5-1 season.
---
we still don't know how or why Balth had a mirror blessed by Lyssa with him to produce the Lazarus illusion.  I don't think we would be fighting Lyssa directly since she's departed with Melandru, Grenth, and co but maybe there's another force who has invaded her old realm that might be eyeing either Tyria or some other resources and struck a deal with Balth to further their goals.
---
perhaps they would bring back Malyck at this time, in the time that we've been doing the dragon/god thing maybe he's figure out just who he is and where he comes from.  could he be a plot thread worth pursuing?  perhaps, dunno if the sylvari should be a plot target race again when we still haven't done much with the other races at that level yet beyond maybe humans.
---
cantha as a whole is low hanging fruit.  Is the imperial govt still in control after 250+ years or has a different power taken it's place and we just haven't heard anything about it yet due to lack of sources?
---
i had mentioned in another thread, but the unending ocean might be fair game after our antics at sea with Dragonfall.  we might have dredged up a new foe by wrecking house over a ley line hub.
---
we dropped the Shining Blade / Livia storyline for a hot minute, maybe it's time we returned to the Scepter of Orr talk...like who has it now.
---
Mountgate 2.0: Now with less mounts and more gates
---
.. Which resulted in more of them working on gw2, having more open communication, and better ability to make hotfixes
---
is the game down?
---
6? wot?
---
People are just complaining that they can't insta-buy all the rewards with gold. There's always people that complain that they finish all the new content way too quickly. Now people are complaining when it takes too long
---
You first!
---
It takes maybe 2 hours for each part of the collection if you don't know where things are at immediately. So 1-2 hours for the scales, set aside a few hours for the events to get all 10 events in each 3 lanes, then another hour or so for giving medicine to each sick skyscale...maybe another hour for the eggs. No clue about the next parts as I'm not there yet.
---
The "3 months to unlock" is a hyperbole. If you don't have ANY charged crystal quartz and don't have the gold to buy the food (12 skyscale food) and a grow lamp , then you'll be waiting about 22 days for charged crystals since you can only do one a day. But you're better off just buying it and farming for gold (or converting gems to gold if you can do that) if you don't want to wait for that. We don't know yet what the next part of the collection is, since this part is timegated to 4 days worth - you can only feed the skyscales 3 times per day and there's 12 of them. Or something like that.
---
Oh!  We don’t even know how long it is yet?  When everyone was freaking out so hard I figured we at least knew the final numbers.  
---
Thank you for the info, I’ll stand by to learn more.
---
The Breachmaker didn't supercharge or amplify the ley line.  All it did was disrupt it.  Basically it was a physical stopper that blocked the normal flow the line, forcing the magic down another branch.
---
You don't need to finish the episodes, just have them so you can access the maps. I've only finished two of them, and I'm on step 3 (feeding it) atm no issue
---
I think there’s be a lot less complaining if there wasn’t a timegate. People are (rightly) upset because timegating runs counter to the idea of playing at your own pace. Overall, I definitely enjoyed the episode and the little bit of the map I’ve played and explored. The meta is a lot of fun and from what I’ve seen decently rewarding too.
---
Unpopular opinion: I really don't give a damn about the timegate. I did the Wintersaber Trainers in World of Warcraft in The Olden Times. I know timegates, this is manageable.
---
"We're trying to appeal to the Burning Crusade audience."
---
i caint read minds so i caitn tell you. but any game dev should know that something that is very accessible in a game, is hyped for an update, and is dangled in front of our faces and then saying "no you cannot have it yet" is an insane oversight. even if they planned for all of this Anet should know after 7 years that this heavily gated content will not be welcomed as something good. this is only a way to either piss off fans or make it to where only certain people will go for it. 
---
Another game where i can point this is Elite Dangerous. The faction ranks are horrible in the game and two ships are locked behind it. its not that often you see those ships and you have to dump at least 30 hours into just doing mission for that faction to get the rank. its bull shit to stretch it out that long when the cashgate should suffice.
---
this is not fun. this is not fair. i can mount a skyscale at anytime in dragonfall. the update was touted for the skyscale. now i have to play for a month to get the skyscale and do nothing else but work on this. i would much rather jsut keep going till my eyes bleed to get it and enjoy the new mount elsewhere in the game. This is coming from someone who doesnt care for mounts either.
---
Oh, I missed that. No problems at all then!
---
They still haven’t fixed Aurene not spawning in Descent so you can’t get past the wall. 
---
I have been stuck here since patch and cannot go forward, I really hope they fix it soon.
---
The new "upgraded" armour requires spirit shards as well as map currency and ectos, so that's something.
---
Oh I dropped a Tasty Dried Carapace (the desert insects thing for day 3) on the scarabs south of Amnoon
---

---
I agree. Which means they DO have a reason, but we don't know what that reason is. Rather than get frothed up in a hate orgy like we've been doing for the past two days, why don't we take a deep breath and face the fact that we don't have all the information we need to actually get angry.
---
Time to pay cash!
---
Hello.  
---
I'm thinking of getting Exotic gear but I don't know where to get them? ( I know I can buy it from the trading post but I don't have much gold )  
---
And Is it a good idea to get Exotic gear then Ascended gear?
---
Yeah, I was meant to support your idea...sorry.
---
Worth noting if you make it early before you get the collection needing it, you'll need to make another or buy one to get it to count for the collection. I tried putting in bank and withdrawing and it didn't count, had to buy and  sell one from the TP
---
1) We have a clear example of a lower impact solution having been done before that you choose to ignore because you're just digging in being a stubborn ass at this point.
---
2) No one agrees with you.
---
cant complain about PvE if you live in WvW :)
---
Like crafting timed items? Elonian leather square, deldrimor steel ingot and etc.?
---
Yeh I’d say the Griffin is harder and everyone has one of them.
---
In my opinion, there's Dungeons, Raids, and Fractals. There's also crafted Legendary Weapons and Armors that you can do. But the TRUE end game is...Fashion Wars. Gotta trick out your character to look more Awesome than anyone else.  
---
Mounts is only available if you get PoF expansions. Then, just start the first story that take you to the Desert and get your first mount, the Raptors. The rest are Heart Task on different maps, and also collections.
---
They're not rioting in the streets. They're whining on Reddit. You said there was NEVER a reason to put a time gate into a video game, and then immediately admitted that keeping players engaged is a reason to put a time-gate in a video game. We're done, here. Thank you for conceding my point.
---
Or they can keep them there and we can watch you leave the game because those big bullies at Anet annoyed you. Believe me the community won't miss you. Bye.
---
I'm cool with the Timegate, i need to slow down and enjoy the game more anyway.
---
No, Raid bosses took 10 ppl and WB took far many more.
---
I don't but you can ask me any specific questions you have and I can probably answer them.
---
sup this is targ, i'm doing great :) Bought a house, married. Play overwatch and Apex mainly. I might stream again!
---
Depends on how much else is involved. Lower it to about the same kind of thing as the beetle was or the griffon and I'd be fine with it. But in its current state I won't do it because the effort is not worth the reward IMO. Either the mount needs to be a whole lot more useful, or a whole lot easier to get. Right now there is a disparity between its usefulness vs the effort required to get it.
---
For me, i just follow the official wiki. Choose which ascended armors and weapons to make, and start grinding.
---
did you not read the rest of my fucking post? they have 30 other ways to keep players playing the game. this timegate on something major is a fucking waste. and this might as well be the streets of the internet. a lot of devs come onto this reddit and there is riots on the forums. but i will agree. take your fucking ball and go home. the rest of us will try and change the game for the better cause this is not fun.
---
Looks like all the Flame Dye Kit dyes dropped the same way, so it's likely something to do with that kit.  Was it re-released recently?
---
There's skin sale already?
---
How why is it low effort? I really want dragon themed legendary!
---
The awakened one with the Sylvari at the burning forest is hysterical. I love it!
---
The rest of your post was irrelevant anger and speculation. You devolved into that hate orgy I specifically called you out for earlier. Go outside more.
---
I just completed the whole "Skyscale Treats" achievement, but only have got the "Pinweight Hatchling" part of the "Skyscale care". It didn't restrict me to feed it more than 3 times and gave me the "Pinweight Hatchling" after I gave it the 14 foods. Please don't tell me this will take 12 days to complete.
---
wouldnt going outside hurt the games playerbase? why do you wanna kill the game?
---
I mean, there's one dragon skin *wink* *wink* that people definitely want
---
It seems they also don't understand the internet. When yoy tell people not to do something. They're going to do it.
---
Lol welcome to World of Warcraft 
---
Seriously though WTF is with timegating bullshit let me play how I want to play goddamnit
---
How can I also a question that I don't know what to ask? I'm a new player I'm 80. I know nothing. A simple "hey walk here and buy this, then do this" isn't too much to ask I don't think. Watching a guy do a raid while talking to me like I've been playing since launch isn't ideal.
---
&gt; You and I have different definitions of what constitutes "gameplay" and what affects it, therefore we're at an impasse.
---
No, you're just objectively wrong, there is no argument here. Your combat mechanics do not change when you got a legendary equiped as opposed to an ascended. You fight the exact same way you would otherwise.
---
Your travel mechanics do change when you got a skyscale. This is simply how it works as a feature.
---
&gt; I'm not conceding this one, so you're free to believe you're right, as am I. I won't argue this one further as its clear you won't see my point of view and I don't agree with yours. ;)
---
You are confused. There is no view point here. There is nothing to agree or disagree with. You are wrong, plain and simple.
---
Your combat mechanics do not change when you got a legendary equiped as opposed to an ascended.
---
Your travel mechanics do change when you got a skyscale.
---
As someone who wrote a guide to Sick Skyscale, I would like to shout out to the community who worked together to help us put together a guide very quickly. 
---
Without you guys, I would not have enough time to get to do all three scavenger hunts before reset which would make me one day late for the time-gate. 
---
I joined several random squad on the LFG, which banded together to find the scales/sick skyscale/eggs because we all had one goal in mind: To get Skyscale.
---
Thank you all.
---
It's not the case at all. You have to have all masteries in a region leveled and bought before you started getting spirit shards.
---
Why would you ever do something if it doesn't benefit you, directly or indirectly?
---
You sound like the office drones who work because someone told you to
---
The xp thing is false, here from the Dev Anet Paul: "You don't have to worry about this. XP you get when you have all available mastery XP tracks maxed goes to a hidden XP bar which will give you spirit shards once you've unlocked all the masteries. This is not well explained, and I actually just found out about it myself yesterday."
---
It would only lower the requirement to 12 Charged Quartz. Its better than waiting 22 days. But, you still have a 12 day time gate.
---
It really does feel like all I log in for is the latest story beat, lately - occasionally Fractals, too, when they add something new to those.
---
I'd love it if the world felt more like a means to an end towards grinding gold, and IMO the game actually did have more of a 'world' in its vanilla state. Sure, all the world content was kind of a joke, but everything felt interconnected in a way that really impressed me. Still does. Instead of just one zone-wide meta-event you'd have a lot of little ones that all changed the zone in some way or another...
---
I concede that era of the game is long behind us, though. I still hate Silverwastes for what it did to zone design as a whole, but even I've gotta admit I enjoy hopping in and doing the meta every now and then.
---
Also: dungeons. Dungeons felt much more like part of the setting than even the best fractals manage to be, I really wish they'd overhaul and revisit them. Dungeons are my favorite part of MMOs, and GW2's vanilla ones had some great ideas they never really expanded upon.
---
&gt; But every other MMO is shittier.
---
The only game with worse gating might be BDO actually. Even Guild Wars 1 wasn't as timegated as GW2. You could do whatever you wanted when you had the urge.
---
Why the fuck are gw2 players so bitchy about this. Have none of you played ANY other mmo in your life?
---
Downvote the fuck out of me all you want but this isn't any new concept
---
Glint is just a lieutenant of Kralkatorrik, her vision might not be as clear and precise as Kralkatorrik. Also it’s possible that she meant to said that way to make people have no hesitation when killing Kralkatorrik.
---
I accidentally completed Dragonfall yesterday and got no transmutation charge or key for doing it because they were locked out. Do people like me get any form of replacement?
---
That was my favorite part of the episode
---
GW2 feels like an amazing *engine* for an MMO that they never thought to add much more than demo content to.
---
Like an E3 demo that makes you go, 'woah, this is great! I wish there were more'.
---
If you applied GW2's combat system alone to any other MMO's world and content, I would probably never escape the resulting addiction.
---
Oh noooo
---
It gives you a 30 minute buff that gives you a chance to loot an extra item off enemies. Combine 12 of them to get an item that sells for a few gold to vendors.
---
I'm actually more annoyed that the first stage made me so basically the same collection thrice. Scales, sick skyscales and eggs are all basically the same, they even are in similar spots, but you can't so them simultaneously. Add to that the fact that navigation on the map is really annoying at times, and it makes for a shitty play experience.
---
Both the food and the grow lamp can be bought off the TP, so there is no charged quartz requirement.
---
That's exactly what I was looking for, thanks!
---
You can buy food? Thanks for letting me know. I did not know we can buy food.
---
You can buy the grow lamp, too.
---
Not yet
---
Not the case at all but you can continue to get spirit shards as loot drops on level 80 characters.
---
&gt;Only level 80 characters can gain BL keys in LW maps.
---
Time to spend my 100+ level up scrolls and 3000 Tome of Knowledge. L M A O
---
Honestly, as someone who spends just casual hours in GW2 now, I ... kind of prefer when I'm not arbitrarily stopped and told to 'come back tommorow'.
---
If I want to spend my weekend progressing on a thing I should be able to. Being 'incentivized' to log in every day just isn't fun to me. Especially when some days I just can't - it feels awful to know that you 'missed' a cooldown and now your grind is another day longer.
---
When is open world ever hard?
---
People are upset because instead of being behind content to do, the skyscale is (at least partially) locked behind "log in and hit this button" non-content.
---

---
I was under the impression that as Aurene took over Kralkatorrik, she spoke of her mother. As she took him over, the line matched for Krakaltorrik, to signify she's him now.
---
Well once I was done with core story, seasons and xpacs I already had the gold so I wouldn't count that in the time sink
---
And it fucking sucks.  Never going back to that shit.
---
If you've got the masteries and mounts you're good to go.  If you get you'll explode but BF is so damned brutal that it doesn't really matter what level you are in that respect.
---
One of the moderators closed my topic just because I was giving my opinion. Lol
---
They're not back. I just did Bloodstone Fen on 9 of my lvl 80 chars, got a transmutation charge on every single comp
---
I think the barrier to entry for new players in ffxiv is absurd and gets higher every expansion. If you wanted to raid in 5.0 you'd be forced to do base game+2 expansion patch cycles worth of story that you may or may not care about then do the initial story in shadowbringers and then do the normal mode raids and try to get your gear up while doing all of that. It's only not shitty if you already play the game.
---
Essentially, yes.
---
And like most things, they're perfectly fine in moderation - you can even spend a little extra gold and just get ones other people made if you're in a rush to craft something.
---
Timegating, at least IMO, is when you're stuck at an impasse and have no choice but to simply *wait*. It's a concept that originated in mobile games, and those usually give you the option to skip your arbitrary timer with cash money. *Thankfully* GW2 hasn't got to that point, and I hope it never does.
---
&gt; When is open world ever hard?
---
I mean tough, as in survivable. I enjoyed the reapers ability to kind of just never die.
---
Yeah you're a real galaxy brain for playing the mechanical masterpiece that is Guild Wars 2
---
sad thing is I stopped playing when I unlocked all mounts. Now i’m back for this one &amp; will probably go back to other games once i’ve snagged this’n
---
This is the worst part of timegating, as a concept, at least to me.
---
Only got one day off a week? Hope you enjoy progressing your thing at 1/7 the speed of anyone else, chump!
---
Crap, I need more bloodstone! I have everything else!
---
It's all doable solo, nothing to worry about.
---
GW2 is grindy as hell, instead of a gear treadmill it's a QoL treadmill. God forbid you want a skin outside the base tyria gear.
---
Think he means thoughest character. Which i would guess any variants of warrior? Or power soul beast has treated me kindly thus far.
---
Oh. So you want a build where you’ll never die. Check out ranger, warrior and Mesmer. That’s probably what you’re looking for
---
So I'm not sure if there is something wrong with my browser. But your way point names all appear as "[&amp;BA8KAAA=]" or variants of it. Is this me or was this intentional?
---
This is probably a special effect from 1 of the jackal skins. I know some of the ninetail skins have  an effect similar to what you described.
---
GW2 team reportedly did not change much.
---
Yah the drop rate of those meat was super high too, most of them dropped withing the first 3 killed, and the toys only took like 5 min.... I'm rly giving them the benefit of the doubt here :,D For the next 3 days it's just log in, feed 3, then back to doing other stuff...
---
It's do-able in theory, but the issue you'll run in to is keeping up with the squad.
---
Give it a shot, but if you find yourself lagging behind, just adjust by leaving each fort a bit early.
---
IKR
---
There’s no gear treadmill like other mmo’s. Ascended stats are the best in the game, and will be probably forever. Gw2 is for the casual audience, so no grinding is necessary, and breaks are pretty unpunishing.
---
I couldn't give less of a shit about showing off to other players. Having interacted with many other players most of them barely even notice other players let alone whatever those players are attempting to show off. While that might be what you're looking for in an MMO there are far more demographics to be found. Many people just want to bop monsters over the head and go on adventures not insert themselves into some kind of digital dick measuring contest where they get to do the online equivalent of a Keeping Up With The Jones's ratrace.
---
Wasn't it not just for opening a flight path for the skyscale so it could actually fly by endurance filling up through collecting orbs?
---
Could be wrong there. That's what I assumed look at it with my skyscale mastery locked.
---
Also.
---
***Greatsword for Revenants***
---
You can play with it to make i happy, feed it if hungry, and wash it if dirty (flies around it).
---
This is kinda the way I see it, a month from now players could have the new mount (because they're already in the process of acquiring it) so they'd buy the upcoming gem store skins regardless. No reason not to buy it unless they genuinely don't need/care about the skin.
---
Nevertheless I agree they could've implemented alternative less timegate-y measures.
---
People keep shitting on Anet because they don't have a reason to go back to the living story maps after they do the story. Anet puts in reasons to go back and a cool mount to get. They get shit on because now people are angry about having to go back to the living story map. FFS.
---
A month in the worst case isn't that bad. Maudrey took me forever to finish. Consider it a motivation to keep up with all your daily crafting. 
---
The charged crystal can also be obtained by mining the rich nodes. There's one in crystal desert in glint's layer, and there's one in dry top when the skritt queen opens the gate. Remember to put on a gathering boost when you go.
---
It's funny because now 80% of the players I see running around on maps have the griffon.
---
So why am I playing raids and dungeons in late game? Just for fun? No gear or rewards?
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OM1SN7ebek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OM1SN7ebek) It'S not the official Rendition, but Kyle Landry made a fairly good one! Sheet Link is in the Description.
---
No. you should get a mail
---
I wish they'd make portal scrolls not level locked now, but ah well.
---
Yes, it's intended, it will be unlocked at next daily reset.
---
i dont think people are blaming the skyscales. they are blaming anet for implementing this horrible wait.
---
Anxiety?
---
Do you have any tips to get "Desert Insects" for the Treats?
---
At least they didn't make yu wait 30 days for a Skyscale to "grow up" eh? ;D
---
I'm kidding. That would be fucking horrifying.
---
According to my observations, only a character that completed the story receives emails that advance skyscale quests. However, once I get the email, any character can progress achievements and talk to Gorrik. This is a very annoying design decision.
---
Collections, achievements, leggie gear, fancy skins, titles, general satisfactions etc.
---
The game isn’t gear based, but something else. The something else depends on what you enjoy.
---
&gt; They get shit on because now people are angry about having to go back to the living story map. FFS.
---
No, have you not been paying attention at all? They're angry because of the time gates.
---
&gt; my clones are just there for the little to no dmg and not there to take dmg
---
You just answered your own question!
---
Yes, clones are not intended to take aggro. They are just there for shattering. Mesmer isn't a class with pets that tank. If you want pets that tank, you play Ranger, or to a lesser extent, Necro.
---
This had me stumped too. I finished the story on one character, then did my exploration and collection on a different who hadn't even started the War Eternal story. I had to log into my character who had completed War Eternal's story to get the mail from Gorrik.
---
I am having a hard time on figuring out on how connecting adding new content connects to being casual friendly. When ANet added Mythwright Gambit. It didn't help me find a group willing to take a noob like me for Spirit Vale. 
---
I am having a hard time connecting PvP and WvW being casual unfriendly as people can just join in at any time rather than getting kicked out of the map. 
---
Maybe you should clarify the connection. At this point, I assume that you are upset about not getting new content in general than actually trying to connect casual friendliness to whatever you are talking about.
---
Thank you for answering 🙏🏼
---
You have to feed it Skyscale Food in addition to the Treats.  Food can only be given 3 times a day for 4 days total.
---
It was said, at one moment in the last episode, that Aurene was different ; that the magics absorbed by her don't actually torment her, don't tear her apart, like they did Kralk. So, she can actually absorb all the magic without going insane from it. I think it's implied right before the fight with the "Facet of War".
---
There are a couple of titles that are pretty prestigious but I doubt most of the playerbase even knows which ones they are. Hell I keep my nameplates off to reduce the visual clutter so I won't even see most of them. Mount skins are such a perfect vanity item; it really sucks they need them for that gem store dough so we'll never get to unlock them through achievements.
---
Yeah like Outward and Divinity Original Sin 2 also
---
Almost definitely. Heck an *Elder Dragon died there*
---
If something is time-gated, you feel pressure to complete as fast as possible so you don't miss a day and need to wait 24 hrs for a reset.
---
&gt;Mesmer
---
I felt incredibly squishy with mesmer (and later chrono) compared to necro/reaper. Haven't really played other classes so can't compare to hem though.
---
Probably shouldn't take more than one person to figure out that this collection is a pile of hot garbage. Then again, these folks put out those weird "you have to fail an event that's really easy in order to complete" achievements so expectations are always low.
---
There are definitely titles that take a huge amount of grinding to get, like Fractal God/Goddess and The Golden Child and that one where you feed that dude through like a hundred trips, and you can't sell those too. 
---
But if you're talking about Leave no hero behind or voice in the void, you can buy those.
---
Lol I main thief so anything makes me feel less squishy (aside from ele.) I’m surprised chrono made you feel squishy since it’s the more tanky Mesmer
---
&gt;experience vs. difficulty
---
These are the same thing in video games and the later diminishes as the former grows. This holds just as true for a *Souls* game as it does for *Cookie Clicker*.
---
"It's too easy" has no value as a judgement about any game because it's entirely subjective. Saying it is unhelpful advice and experienced players should stop doing it. "It's too easy for me" is correct but it does make a person sound like an asshole so maybe it's best to avoid it altogether.
---
And I’m saying the time gates are there because everyone was complaining that they had no reason to go back to the map. The player base got exactly what they asked for. They may not like it. But it’s what kept being asked of anet constantly. 
---
Anyway. While I’m at it another way to get the charges quartz is to get the home node. They also drop from “HOT” reward tracks in PVP and WvW.
---
Just remove the bloody timegate. No need to meet and discuss just do it ffs
---
Of course theyd pull this shit
---
Jesus, how hard were you masturbating when you wrote this.
---
Infusions can be traded.
---
Dedicated rewards can be earned over time, crafted or bought after doing the events enough times if you are not lucky.
---
RNG-only only produces uncertainty and frustration.
---
We already have enough of that in real life. Some things may take a long time, but they are possible.
---
RNG-only can result in things being so unlikely they are undistinguished from being impossible.
---
Personally I like learning different classes, grinding achis, while making gold for a leggie through fractals and the tp. This is what I enjoy, but not necessarily everyone else. There is just too much stuff to do in the game to have a universal goal in the game. It’s up to you to find what you want to achieve in the game, and there’s many options to choose from. I hope you find your goal soon :D
---
It's possible that at the time Kralk was scared and feared death but after his time of torment he's come to accept his fate and death.
---
Just play with it and clean the nest.
---
It works like a tamagotchi.
---
Adorable!? The thing has done nothing but fill.me with hatred for it with the tie gates! I geneualy wish it dies
---
I already know that one of the 1st thing I'm gonna do when I unlock it (if I honestly dont quit this shit before) is to mount on it and stand in front of any random ass hydra on the new map and wstch it get bombed over and over until I'm sastified
---
Why did we had to kill Kralk!? I wish we just let him end everything by now
---
Personally I hoped to see My Beautiful Infrastructure changed. 25 events completed to get Mist Shard Boots is kinda absurd for an event that is not often up. If you don't do server hopping it can take a long time.
---
Somebody please tell me it rewards you a mini hatchling or something, the (technically) 20 days time gate is ridiculous!
---
I never thought I would read this sentence.
---
Bloodstone fen has HOT enemies. Which means that they don’t have the aggro range of POF enemies that were designed to track and hunt mounted players on the move.
---
Power revenant (herald and renegade both work well) with Devastation and Retribution trait lines, and run dwarf stance as your second legend along with your elite. You can get ludicrously tanky with tons of lifesteal. Go sword + sword / hammer. You can facetank almost as hard as a reaper, but with damage reduction and lifesteal instead of a second health bar.
---
how can I see what class my opponent is?
---
I WARNED YOU THIS WOULD HAPPEN! BACK IN THE NORTH, I WARNED YOU, BUT YOU DIDN'T CARE TO HEAR! WELL, HEAR IT NOW!
---
What planet are you from that a month is 5 days?
---
You're raising a baby from an egg to an adult you can fly on. Sorry that takes 5-6 days. 
---
Sorry if you didn't have charged quartz already, but plenty of people did and it had zero fucking use. So yes, they decided to use something which was relevant (magically charged crystals to feed a mini-dragon) in order to give value to a material that had none. You can pay the ~100-200g (still cheaper than Griffon) if you don't have the materials already or don't want to gather those over 22 days. 
---
Whats wrong with having to ROLEPLAY IN A ROLEPLAYING GAME that maybe, just maybe, hatching and raising an entire fucking mini-dragon from an egg might take at least a whopping 5 days.
---
The Skyscale isn't hard to get. It just involves a lot of waiting. The hardest part I've encountered so far was spending 15 minutes looking for a scale only to realised I already picked up.
---
Sometime in the future, it *might* prove to be a tiny bit more challenging to obtain because there's currently a bunch of people helping each other out with portals and resses and that kind of stuff which won't last forever but even then it's not going to be "hard" to get.
---
The cheapest way to probably get rid of them is with the piece of skyscale food.  Considering it uses the least amount of materials.
---
What can they do at this point? Assuming that the next unknown step doesn't contain even more time gating, it's unlikely that a change at that point would really affect anyone outside of the charged quartz crystals. And that ship has kind of sailed. There would be legitimate concerns, though one may or may not agree with them, that removing that time gate would be unfair to those players who've reached that stage already and have put gold into getting the items necessary. They could remove the time gating on feeding and moving from one collection set to the next, but for anyone wanting to stay on top of these, the damage has already been done.
---
The greatest concern, of course, is for players who's time is quite limited. For them, I hope good changes come, but I don't think even most of the criticism on time gating was for their behalf. For everyone else, hopefully this is something arenanet has learned to stay away from in the future for something like a mount.
---
That's provably why that went for such low hanging fruit as a dragon mount.
---
I would need to know What area, and what mob that you are talking about. I can't do anything with the information that you provided.
---
lol i thought anthem just stopped trying / caring altogether. i heard that bioware leadership actually blamed players for the state of the game.
---
the only think we can do is just ignore the official forums, just don't talk about them, they lose their power if only the devs themselves use them.
---
You can wear two identical trinkets at the same time *if they aren’t unique*. For example, raid trinkets and Mists (FOTM, PvP, and WvW) rings/accessories.
---
Time gating first started about 25 years ago in Everquest when they introduced the fear and hate planes. The mobs only reset every 12 hours so you had to schedule with other guilds so you could do the content and get rewards. Plus you had a subscription fee on top of that. There was an actually a raid calendar set up by players so the big guilds could schedule around each other to plan their allotted time spot. Oh and if you weren't in an "elite" guild you never even got to experience the content at the time...content you had actually paid for and were still paying for. Some things never change because developers don't learn from past developers ill thought out designs.
---
I have a feeling they aren't going to be making very much money off of mount skins with this one.
---
In abilities, no. In acquisition, yes.
---
imo if they wanted to make a time gated grind challenge like this, they shouldn't have promoted it as the main subject of this update but as a sub quest that rewards player that grind through it. now players came back with an idea of a new mount(which im unsure the value is really worth atm) that has multiple timegated grind quest.
---
It's all honestly just given me one more reason to go and buy the new ESO expansion coming in June.  
---
I was gonna hold off because their content is the polar opposite of GW2 in that it's better the less people are running around an area but I doubt I'll have much of a reason to come back here in the near future.
---
can you point to where i'm being hostile? from my perspective i'm just telling you my opinion in a neutral tone, which i know i can be blunt but i'd hardly call it hostile. this is the first time i've responded to you my friend, so idk what youre on abt in the first part of your response. i'm just sayin some people aren't capable of time management the way you are. no need to make a production out of it
---
No because you people will just whine about the skin being too hard to get.
---
No Champion or veterans needed to get treats.  Just completed the achievement.  Might need to kill 5 to 15 low level to see the treats

Even if it weren't time gated, actually MAXING out your gear with absolute BiS equipment means beating raids on their highest difficulty.  
---
It takes most people months just to beat them at all assuming they even do raids.  
---
In terms of getting raid ready gear, that usually happens via doing dungeons while leveling to the new cap.  
---
GW2 is the only MMO I've ever played where I was cognizant of the dev's attempts to keep me playing at their pace. Every other game does it as well but their ceiling is well above what a normie player will achieve.
---
Its not like the whole episode was made just to release the skyscale. The episode was released for the story. They also released a mount for you to work towards. Part of working towards that mount is literally raising your own from an egg. That takes time. So they chose to force it to literally take time because it makes sense. That time is still less than a week. And for most people who have school/work, it means they just have to log in to feed it 3x a day until its matured. 
---
Do the starting collections over the weekend to get the egg. feed the egg during the week by logging in daily. 
---
Do the rest of the stuff the next weekend and you have your mount. Theres not really a problem there. Sorry if you hate tomogatchis or whatever then just don't get the fucking mount, no one said you had to. Its all over the new map so you can use it there, but it is literally not needed anywhere, at all. 
---
Sorry they actually put the mount in the game so you can get it at your own pace (quick as 1 week) instead of forcibly gating it to 6 weeks where even if you did everything you're forced to wait for them to finally put it in the game? Like? What?
---
Also I'm confused, how is there something you work towards for 6 weeks but its not announced yet? How do you knowingly do something for 4 weeks without it being known?
---
I also assume those things are generally generic shit to do in order to unlock it where this is an achievement in a roleplaying game about you actually raising your own living thing over time, giving it toys, feeding it, teaching it things, etc.
---
So west problem is timegate while east is ultra low rng.
---
Companies just want people to stay the most amount of time On the game, but they don't want to put effort in making it fun, this is sooo saaad.
---
Core warrior with defense+might makes right and condi weaver are very hard to kill in open world, at least for me
---
.....and here i thought its quite pretty for a weapon lol  
---
but some "old" player think its just a boring re-skin.....guess its one of the downside for being a long time player....nothing surprise you anymore xD
---
If people weren't farming the hell out of the new map I might be inclined to agree. Also, how many people complained about things being done too fast and leaving them with nothing to do? You cant have it both ways. Either there are time gates, which suck, or you have nothing to do, which sucks.
---
They always will. Then when they have the items they will whine for more content.
---
&gt;ESO's combat isn't that great
---
Define "not great"?  
---
About the only thing different from gw2 is there's no target locking and a trinity system. There's even dodge rolling in ESO.
---
The best part is people are calling it cliche when it's based on a game series that's been around for 25 years.  
---
You have to run a DOS emulator to even play the first game.
---
I'm vaguely amused that you think that cosmetic options exist solely for showing off to others. Why do you think many single player games have such extensive character customisation options if that kind of thing exists solely to show off to others? For many people cosmetics and customisation is for their own self-satisfaction. They're not looking for external validation. Most people are too busy doing to their own thing to notice others. I remember this one time I was looting AB and there was a guy at the end on a Dhuum Throne who had plonked himself down in a prominent position trying to show off and everyone just walked straight past him to get their loot. Didn't pay him any attention. Didn't say anything to him. Nobody gives a shit.
---
Twilight, sunrise, eternity, and shooshadoo are all bottom tier garbage. Moot is top tier
---
Condi. Power is only good as a speed run strat where you have the absolute most meta of comps. Since you're not speed running, going for condi is better. You can easily swap between quickness share and regular DPS by swapping your runes set if you feel dissatisfied where as power you should/can have from DH but then you wouldn't be firebrand.
---
In my opinion  the only thing that sucks about this Collection are the time-gates. The actual content is quite enjoyable.
---
Fuuuck not charged quartz again!!
---
jep. started playimg a renegade just for it tbh. the dreamer is what my heart desires
---
I like your fashion wars.
---
Only thing I might change is that you can griffon from the north shrine to 9. Nice work op, hopefully things can get a bit more set once everyone settles down.
---
Probably unlocks after completing the Skyscale Rider achievements: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bphdr6/upcoming_skyscale_rider_achievements/

That could be where I'm lacking. I've not done the living story 😅 I'll check it out this weekend and see if I can't blast through some.
---
Same
---
I was going to start after a few days of completing the final episode but with all the talk of time gating I haven’t started at all.
---
Feels pointless.
---
&gt;I still hate Silverwastes for what it did to zone design as a whole

Inexperienced player here, what does it mean?

Oh I’m sorry, I probably misunderstood it. Thanks for clarifying!

There are some floaty purple orbs around the world map, not just dragonfall. I know this because when I went to kill skelks for the skyscale achievement I went to wayfarers foothills and found one.
---
Also: When i take a full squish raid build into some content and get oneshot by mobs.
---
It's not hard (I can outdps them if I try hard enough) but considering they're heavy melee builds with almost no damage mitigation or defensive measures, I tend to down. A lot.
---
I like to call Twilight the "basic bitch" legendary.
---
Very few people try to build an outfit around it and a lot think it's somehow still impressive despite being the most commonly seen legendary.
---
Making me wait a day to do an hours worth of content doesn't make it more content.  It makes me log out to go play something else because I physically can't progress in the game anymore.
---
No you can get any I believe.

---
I had this entire reply but my phone was spastic.
---
In summary, from a British Teapot “oh fock off!”
---
No, you will get any mount skins regardless of whatever mount you have.
---
I.e you'll still get Jackal skins if you don't have Jackal yet.
---
Every game has its toxic people usually when it comes to any sort of PvP and high-level PvM.
---
On OSRS though, it's pretty visible mostly everywhere on common social media channels (subreddit, discord, forums), and even casual PvM stuff (sand crabs, pest control, etc)
---
I still want a legitimate model-changing wyvern skin for skyscale.
---
The core argument is "No sub fee, no right to complain." which is dumb.
---
There is two more locked achievement left after this one.
---
I wouldn’t because it’s just a skin, you people just assume that everyone has the time in the world to wait but we’re not in your position...
---
See I can do the ‘you people’ thing too
---
Bad take. Nobody is complaining about how much you have to do for this collection, but that you *can’t do it at your own pace.* Nobody with two brain cells to rub together expect to master an instrument overnight either, so your analogy is weak.
---
My favorite so far is the Crystal Bloom Blade and the Crystal Bloom Weaver in the burning forest camp.
---
&gt;Blade: Everyone's on the offensive, and where are we? Stuck on guard duty!  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Weaver: You want to "bum-rush" Kralkatorrik?  
---
&gt;Blade: Yes! I'm a follower of Balthazar, and Balthazar's followers are never last to a fight!  
---
&gt;Weaver: You're already IN the fight. We're practically standing on top of him!
---
Its amazing how many people know exactly what a desert is like and then complain its the same in a game.
---
That's great, thank you! 😘
---
Hi, yes, welcome to last year.
---
It should have been a 3 tier armor collection.
---
I think the intended design is that you log in to feed your hatchling/charge quartz/whatever and then you something in game catches your attention and you keep playing for hours... but does this work at all?
---
It was the same with the beetle/backpack/something from one of this seasons maps where you had to give something to that one scientist once per day for a week or something... 
---
Like i logged in to feed the hatchling and then logged out and started playing something else. Do you guys do it differently? Did you log in just to work towards the mount, but then did fractals for 2 hours or something?
---
Yep, that one 100% can be improved. I tested a bunch more ways _after_ I had already done the map and video, of course :P The fastest is to take the lava tube NW of Burning Forest WP and just let it shoot you all the way to the platform. 
---
Current path takes ~33s
---
Griff from N Shrine takes ~29s
---
Lava Tube E of N Shrine &gt; Glide at Apex &gt; Griff Boost Dive takes ~25s
---
Lava Tube NW of BF WP takes ~20s
---
It's just whether 13s is worth me redoing the video and map or not :D
---
The griffon also doesn’t dick you over by telling you “NO. You now have to wait for a daily reset in order to be able to keep working on it.”
---
Can’t currently log into the game, maybe another player can answer this more confidently. There are ‚adoption licenses‘ that let you choose which skin you want, they should be around 1200 gems iirc, but I don’t know which is currently available. There are also some standalone skins which rotate in and out of the store
---
I mean I didn’t mind doing the collections for the griffon(except for 250G) because of the story behind it, I didn’t mind AS much as for the beetle cause it still had some BS things but not as bad. The skyscale is on a whole new level. The requirement to rush everything makes it worse.
---
accurate
---
I just want the same skin but more ways to dye it. I dislike the one dye channel only.
---
There's lore implications behind every runestone you made for the druids, you were growing a cosmetic backpiece that did nothing for you other than give you ascended stats, and you actually had to play the map for more than an hour every day.  With the skyscale, I finish the collections in the hour, and on feeding the skyscales, all I have to do is press a button 3 times a day for four days now.  That's not really content.
---
The start of the collection was really nicely done.  I enjoyed the scavenger hunt around the map and learning about the skyscales and the like.  However, now that I can only sit around in an instance with a creature that doesn't even move from the nest, it's not even fun.  At least with the runestone, I was beating up mobs and getting loot.
---
You tried, I thought your explanation was good!
---
You know, for as squishy as thief is, seeing your health get low then swapping to p/p and hitting unload to get half your health back is super satisfying. I run healing signet and heal on crit for open world, so I basically dont die unless I get 1-2 shot or chain cc'd (I hate bloodstone fen and certain HoT areas.)
---
that change only applies to lw maps. core tyria maps will still drop keys for levelling players.
---
It's definitely not bugged. Just takes time to spawn.
---
That doesn't make sense in the locations I have seen them in, many of these Rifts are low to the ground or otherwise not in sensible places for refuel stations.
---
Also **Greatsword for Revenant!**
---
If you use the TP, charged quartz is not needed.
---
Have you played other MMOs? Hell even singleplayer games are worse offenders nowdays.
---
Asked myself the same question but it’s his opinion
---
Oh I'm sure they knew the problems would be there, they just didn't expect the backlash would be so large.
---
thank you sir
---
If you own PoF you own HoT too don't you?
---
To much to do was never the problem, it is only the problem if you are not able to do it until the daily reset you will lose a day until you can make a new collection. Thats one reason why the time gate should go.
---
'More realistic' does not equal fun to play.

I absolutely love Dragonfall's map's design. Aside from the annoying Wurms every 20 meters sniping me wherever the fuck I go, it's a joy pleasure to run/fly around.
---
Also the new armor set is dope.
---
I saw some people going around the wing in order to reach the highest place, so I'm here to share a method which you can easily reach it with a few jumps (and without the annoying wall-grabbing feature).
---
The double-dose of timegates on the bit where you feed the Skyscale are the most egregious part, IMO. Not only do you have to wait a minimum of four days; if you don't have enough charged quartz going into it, you have to wait even *longer* if you don't want to buy any of the food or a grow lamp - which is kind of a triple timegate, since the lamp and the food BOTH use a timegated crafting material!
---
FFXIV has an insane entry barrier though. Either you drop an absolutely insane amount of money or you'll be grinding through story quests for so long that the getting to endgame doesn't even feel like anything but pure relief.
---
“Should Anet make things easier” Man you are just obnoxious just like most of the community who cant work for one thing and you gotta cry for an easier task...
---
Great comment. Want to add: mesmer also has tons of extra evasion and distortion, making matters even worse/better
---
Whenever I've had to contact support I've typically received a response within 72 hours, at most a week, but when they have a huge backlog they've been known to take over a month.
---
Since a new episode has just dropped, I'm guessing they have multiple support requests that are similar to yours (i.e. people who want to get back onto their account). So there might be a longer waiting period than usual.
---
Seriously, that’s false advertising.  We should rise up against that guy!
---
Why not just go left where you first land on the wing? You can even do that with Springer or Griffon.
---
GW2 combat for me isn't any better than WoW combat, they are both okay for MMO's but it's not anything to write home about.
---
Anet has responded on their forums:
---
"...I wanted to provide a brief update after talking to various developers. We’re aware of the concerns expressed in this thread. The team is currently regrouping and we’re aiming to communicate more about this topic as soon as we possibly can.
---
In the meantime, we're pushing a hotfix that will include hiding the skyscale Mastery line for players who have not acquired the skyscale so that they will continue to gain Mastery experience toward acquiring Spirit Shards.
---
We're also working on another hotfix coming later that will alleviate issues with finishing the Skyscale of Ice achievement in Frostgorge Sound by making the Corrupted Ice Elementals near the Claw of Jormag event respawn regularly. These creatures can encase you in ice and progress the Skyscale of Ice achievement. This is a temporary fix until we can get something more permanent.
---
Thank you for your understanding and patience."
---
Power reaper is actually pretty great in fractals, as long as you know how to dish out the damage. Everyone who cares about DPS on T4s run arcdps, so they can see straightaway if you're pulling your weight or not. Hence, I've never seen anyone kick a power reaper actually doing good numbers. Not running power reaper isn't actually necessarily going to get you accepted into more groups, especially if you don't know how to play the builds.
---
Since you enjoy reaper, my suggestion for your priorities are:
---
1. Get your reaper to 150AR and get into T4s. Additionally if you're worried about performance, get arcdps to see how you're doing. If you're underperforming, then do some training and, as they say, git gud.
---
2. Do daily T4s and get the omnipotion ASAP.
---
3. As you do daily T4s and build up lots of gold + resources, slowly get the gear for banner warrior.
---
Have fun!
---
There were tons of "This is Great" posts before people found out about the timegates. Let people be angry about something they have right to be angry about.  
---
And to talk about my experience.  
---
The story was great for a few episodes now, it's the only game that gives me chills. (Few made me cry, but that's something else). I don't even mind something a lot of people mind about the story because it makes in lore sense.  
---
Map is fun, there could be more lore in it, but it makes sense that there isn't.  
---
Shame the mount is really boring and useless, griffon is still superior, but I'm fine with that because I like how griffon looks.

Seriously they always have to dress their mistakes up "oh we havent communicated our vision well enough" or some other nonsense instead of admitting / fixing it
---
There is a reason why I haven't done those achievements and never will. You can guess why.
---
Time gates maybe a fundation of a lot of other MMOs, but it doesn't mean GW2 should jump on the bandwagon of lazy design, as most people try to defend this stupid statement. "Every other game has time gates, stop whining and accept it". No. GW2 always strived to be different and stand out since the launch, I'm not going to watch these shit timegates slowly slipping into every single thing in the game without a word. There is a line where I say time gates are absolutely acceptable (legendaries, ascended stuff etc), but not here. Many people thinks differently, and that's good, we are not the same, but it won't make it any better design.
---
[Difluorite Crystal](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Difluorite_Crystal) can also be used for ascended ring + accessory. Since they are unique like all Living Story trinkets you can only really have 1 of each equipped at the same time so it means if you have no other/better way to get PoF-only stats, with Difluorite and Mistborn Motes you can get a full set of Harrier ascended trinket for example.
---
Difluorite can also be used to craft a very cheap alternative to the meta power food: the [Avocado Smoothie](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Avocado_Smoothie) which only "costs" 2 snowflake (the rest is bought with Difluorite and Karma) for a grand total loss of 20 Power and 10 Ferocity (so if you are on a budget it's more than enough for a very small DPS loss).
---
[Inscribed Shard](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Inscribed_Shard) are used for the Roller Beetle mount collection, get some inscription/insignia for Plaguedoctor, collection leading to the [Banner of the Dauntless Commander](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ascended_Banner_of_the_Dauntless_Commander) backpack and (last but not least) a [Dancing Choya Tonic](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Endless_Choya_Dance_Tonic).
---
[Lumps of Mistonium](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Lump_of_Mistonium) are used for the [Requiem Armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Requiem_armor) initial collection and to buy/craft the 2 remaining sets.
---
[Branded Masses](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Branded_Mass) are used for Diviner inscription/insignia and [Dragonsblood weapons](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dragonsblood_weapons).
---
Lmao 10/10
---
Well, for those people it may feels that regardless. 
---
I had the same problem with Lord of the Rings: it was not my first fantasy book, I've read a ton of them before it. And when I've read LotR, I felt that, well it's good, but I sort of see / read all of these things. Of course intellectually I know that it's the grandfather of every fantasy, but it just did not felt so great for me. I presume many younger people is the same with "old" game worlds: so many game / story copied from them that now they seems to be a bit bland for those who only encountered them later.

Why not using volatile magic trail? It leads you to the top, recharging flight gauge

If you can use Oakheart essences, those also help immensely.
---
Bubbles is in the depths of the Unending Ocean. Hundreds of miles away.
---
Kralkatorrik fell a mile off the coastline.
---
It's like skinnydipping off the coast of New York and going "WHERE IS ENGLAND POLICE TO ARREST ME!"
---
OK, here's the scoop.
---
For nearly all builds you'll want **Berserker** stats (power, precision, ferocity). It will give you the best DPS for power-based classes and weapons.  If you run a build emphasizing condition damage (burning, poison, etc.), the equivalent is the Viper stat combination (condi damage, power, precision, expertise), which requires Heart of Thorns and is almost exclusively obtained by one of [these](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Slooshoo) [NPCs](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Scholar_Rakka).
---
These are the fastest, most cost- and time-efficient ways to get ascended gear:
---
1. **Rings** from [this NPC](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/BUY-2046_PFR) by doing fractal dailies (check the LFG and join a group).
---
2. **Amulet** using Laurels, I recommend [this NPC](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Laurel_Merchant_(WvW)) because badges of honor are useless.
---
3. **Backpiece** from [this collection](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Raise_the_Banners:_Amnoon_Independence) in PoF or Slooshoo. If you lack expansions, [these](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Crafter%27s_backpack) are a great alternative.
---
4. **Accessories** using [Guild Commendations](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild_Commendation_Trader), just trust me on this one, join a no-nonsense guild for missions
---
5. Now **weapons**. Find which crafting profession is required to craft your weapons of choice and raise it to [level 500](http://gw2crafts.net/).  Now [buy the recipe](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sigurlina_Jonsdottir#vendor53) and craft it. Yes, this is the most efficient in every respect, welcome to time-gated mats.

6. Ascended **armor** is crap, don't get it unless you're gonna do t4 fractals or raids. If you're determined, armor is done the same way as weapons. Fractal armor, WvW armor, and PvP armor are NOT more efficient either monetarily or time-wise. Ascended armor is a pain.
---
7. Once you're ascended, t4 fractals and raids are BY FAR the easiest way to get more ascended gear, and I would highly recommend them for medium armor.
---
i'm aware of that, i just hoped ppl would come with better theories then "kralk fell in the sea so DSD next"
---
I have a feeling that's the same reason Anet ignores your opinion. 
---
I kid, but only cause I'm broke too.
---
Why is the end half of the story apologetics for a dragon, explained away as him getting magical indigestion, yet he was acting out even before he had consumed the magic?  
---
Furthermore; why is the story always so rife with plotholes?
---
So basically same thing as with Southsun once?
---
1. Foefire cleansing
---
2. Human-charr peace treaty (I feel like this will be included in the Foefire cleansing plot thread)
---
3. Replacements for Zhaitan and Mordremoth (Aurene replaced Kralkatorrik, but we need a bare minimum of four Elder Dragons living based on S3 and PoF so it'd be good to not have her replace them too)
---
4. Malyck (I feel like this will be included in the replacement for Mordremoth plot thread)
---
5. Taimi's illness
---
6. Overseer Kuda
---
7. Elonian political recovery (we won't be involved based on the Commander's words to Zaiem)
---
8. Finding a means to kill and replace Primordus, Jormag, and the deep sea dragon.
---
9. Remnants of Scarlet's alliances (we never killed - or even met - their bosses, and Aetherblades are canonically still around under Mai Trin)
---
We still got a bit we could do. Though only 3, 5, and 8 are "needs resolving" I suppose.
---
This happened to my group on release, but we 'fixed' it by letting someone else be the instance owner...might be a workaround for you too?
---
I can't stand Rubi but I might just tune in for this shitshow.
---
Removing a time gate is almost certainly not just a matter of pressing a button, nor is any other change. Maybe it's less a matter of discussing alternatives and other topics, but (more likely) just a matter of making sure doing so won't break anything or negatively impact other pieces of content.
---
Except people are NOT playing; they're demoralized by the time gates and/or gold sinks involved. Many people have decided they don't need the new shiny now or they don't need the new shiny ever. They are NOT incentivized to login at all. 
---
The charged quartz requirements are usually fine for old-timers, but take a moment to consider new players. You know, the ones who came because of the new marketing, the discounts on the game and its seasons? How are they going to get their hands on charged quartz which has quite limited availability? Do you tell them just to go farm gold and skip fun?
---
Most of the open world won't care what your build is. Chrono will always have better DPS than Mirage simply because [Chronophantasma](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chronophantasma) exists and no PvE enemies have enough health for condi to kill faster than power.
---
But please, play what you want. I run sword-based power Mirage in boon Chrono raid gear and it's hella fun. Regret nothing.
---
I'm really not willing to write off the Skyscale yet.  Yeah, right now the griffon is better in 99% or places, but grif was also improved vastly by the masteries.  I think we need to wait to see what those are before calling the Skyscale definitively useless.
---
That was a long time ago though. Before "recurrent player spending" and "consistent player engagement" and so on. :(
---
But yeah, as amazing as many parts of this episode sound, and as hopefully as it + the recent class balancing work makes me that the restructuring at ANet and a renewed focus on GW2 actually results in the game getting the reworks, redesigns and general changes it should have gotten 5-6 years ago... they kinda already lost me. Am too engaged playing FF14 by now, which has tons of flaws in its own right but so does GW2, and at least for the time being FF14 is the evil I don't yet know.
---
i think it still could've been implemented better. like have the timegate start it's countdown before you finish the collection or something
---
ESO combat is boring as hell. Yes in GW2 you pretty much only have to press 1 to win but at least the attacks feel good
---
3rd Newborn Scale  -  I had a little difficulty locating the third newborn scale, so i made a screenshot for anyone else who might need it https://imgur.com/QcYdNS2
---
I loved story, I love not long time gates. I love that I can use beetle in many places. Idea about all possible exploration masteries it's cool. 
---
I feel that all events are rewarding. I get a lot of rares and t6 mats.
---
I’m single and I work in healthcare. I have plenty of discretionary income. I’ve spent quite a bit on keys. I would buy more if they made them more consistently rewarding so I wouldn’t have to wait every 3 chests to justify buying more.
---
They’re missing out on people who have large amounts of money to put to the game but need an extra nudge to spend it (i.e., aren’t addicted).
---
The biggest whales who are addicted are going to buy the chests even if they keep them as they are. But people like me actually base our purchasing decisions on what’s in the chests.
---
I’m just saying, they could get another 500 out of me if they made changes. I love supporting this game because it’s quality. It’s just the lootboxes are still meh half the time
---
I understand, but if they changed it so that wasn't the case, it would be wonderful.  As it is, using them isn't very practical since we use mounts everywhere.
---
You can also get them out of some Christmas or Halloween bags if I recall correctly.
---
I was gonna make a post, but i guess ill just respond to this post here. 
---
I believe people are overreacting a lot about time-gating. Like what exactly is the problem? That you will not get the mount the first day but the 4th or 5th or even a week after depending your life? The story just came out, people are doing it, doing achievements and what not, i did my 3 meta events in dragonfall in a row yesterday night, managed to get the medicine for the skyscale, im not feeling even a bit behind in terms of time, the time will come when i or you will finish and get the mount and still use all of the others maybe even more than the skyscale. 
---
Where i am getting to is, that we all play a game where we dont pay any monthly subscription, the mount does not hinder us in doing content except exploring an area or two, which you can do that the next days and every post is talking about time-gating and why it takes so long, play the game, enjoy your time and stop stressing yourselves about unimportand things in life.
---
It's only a mile off of Orr, which is in the way from LA. It would be a small tidal wave on the southern coast of Orr and Scavenger's Causeway but that's about it.
---
so active enough so you don't get caught for afking?
---
nice another skin that i will never get.
---
Like the Sunless Skins. 
---
nearly 7 years, not one weapon.
---
i think anet put a -10000% MF on my acocunt.
---
Completely with you, same for the Sunless weapons as well. And yet when you suggest adding non-rng methods everyone just downvotes.
---
I downloaded and copied the Arc DPS d3d6.dll from May 14 and now I don't the message anymore.  
---
This is the only plugin I use.
---
Thanks for this! It was really helpful!
---
As to help anyone out who wants to see where the Skyscale are physically, I have pictures of all the Skyscale's locations in-game (not from the map), #4 -14 (sorry I missed the first 3).
---

---
It's not incredibly more desirable. T4 groups will typically look for the following in order of priority:
---
1. A healer
---
2. A boon provider
---
This means either druid/chrono or ren/brand comps, typically. A lot of groups don't even ask for banners, although if you join on banners on a group that still needs it, people won't complain. But my point is: once heals + boons are covered, people usually will just LFG for dps. I haven't LFG'ed specifically for banners in a looooong time, and my warrior has been retired for longer.
---
What spot? Is it in Dragonfall because I am pretty sure I can get there. I've been over every damn inch of this map.
---
Just popping in to agree with Greatsword for Revanent
---
Actually it was bugged the other day. You have to complete events near the academy and one event got bugged and wouldn’t progress. The NPC was cowering from enemies that weren’t there.
---
The griffin has nothing to do with the skyscale, griffin is about speed they have completely different functionalities. Skyscale is about climbing.
---
Skyscale with max masteries can pretty much ascend any obstacle and can reach much higher than the bunny. Tbh it will completely take over as far as climbing goes. I wouldnt be surprised if people who aquire it stop using bunny altogether.
---
Ofc the time gate is annoying but skyscale will be one the most used mounts in the coming weeks, once people max the masteries.
---
I absolutely abhor any idea of time gating, even the time gating on the previous mounts (mainly in the form of non-soloable bosses) caused me a lot of stress simply because I have very limited time to play...
---
So I agree that this was a really poor design decision and I hope they change it..
---
That being said, despite playing on and off since launch, I adore the mounts in gw2 so much I'd say it's my fav part of the game; I even forced myself to play wvw despite not really enjoying it just to get warclaw (yes I know it's pretty much useless outside of wvw, but I hated the idea of not having a mount unlocked \^\^; ). And I wanted a dragon mount so bad for so long (gimme a horse, though, why are there no horses in Tyria ;\_; or at least a deer...) I am willing to just do whatever it takes to unlock it. Do I like it more than griffon, flight-wise? Well, not really. Will I use it over griffon most of the time? Hell yes!
---
In fact, the new mount is not exist. At the final stage, you will discover that there is an infinite loop made up by many time gated achievements.
---
If the mount is boring and useless why does everyone care about how long it takes to get it? You can't really have it both ways. Boring and useless is a good thing if it takes forever to get it or it's too expensive. Take your time, get it casually and you're not missing out.
---
On a more serious note, sure people can be angry about something they have a right to be angry about. But everyone has a "right" to feel anything they want to, whether or not that feeling has any basis in logical reasoning. The only real issue people have to complain, they're not getting XP or spirit shards, is handled now. The other thing about taking longer to get something or making them wait? That's not a think that needs the kind of tirade we've seen.
---
New people come here see one compliment thread and four hundred complaint threads and they're going to think it's mostly negative. It's one negative thing and a bunch of positive things. Having threads to show people who aren't in the know that this isn't just some one sided thing is just as important as your right to complain.
---
I don't really have a problem taking my time to get a mount. And I'm quite enthralled with the new zone. I think it's beautiful. I find the meta fun and profitable. I haven't gotten all the new armor yet, but I'm glad it's there. I like the new legendary great sword. And I love all the various things in this zone from other zones, from lava tubes, to oak heart essence, to leylines. I like the story a lot.
---
People have a right to be angry and people have a right to be impressed. You make it sound like just because I'm impressed I'm saying no one has a right to be angry. Of course they do. And those who aren't have just as much right to express their enjoyment of the new zone.
---
You can't have that both ways either.
---
Fantastic!
---
nah, ill guve you a 4/10 for effort. this doesn't look like charizard.
---
I don't ask the desert to give me verrticality but  just something more impressive, out of the expansion zones (not the lw zones which werent even in the discussion) the most impressive area to me was the dwarfen ruins in the desert highlands. You can't even get a good screenshot of the desert dunes because some smartass had the brilliant idea to fill it with useless annoying mobs.
---
how is it upgraded?
---
Yes!! Thanks for the update pm, I'll get it up and going sometime tomorrow and report back.
---
Is just some en masse defenestration, completely normal
---
Doot da doop
---
What are the errors you are getting?
---
I'm very impressed, 10/10
---
Hey it's better than loot box RNG only, so there's that
---
Well to be honest, we spent like 4 hours yesterday to do one step of collection, so once we did it, we were quite exhausted to continue anyways. It is a lot of stuff to do, way more stuff than for griffon.
---
So...yea. It is pretty much epic final quest of release. No need to rush it, in my opinion, as it is quite enjoyable one (the choice of places and stuff to do is nice).
---
Start the game with " -repair" command line in your shortcut
---
Maybe a touch low in WvW and cities excluding LA, but 50-60 in open world sounds about right.
---
About its stamina/verticality limitations remember the raptor leap and bunny hop with and without masteries unlocked. There's a chance that the skyscale masteries will improve it in a similar manner.
---
Wow, I really like your thinking at the end there. That's a very interesting theory.
---
It's not an rng only drop, it's an rng only skin. You can craft an ascended weapon that's exactly the same - other than the cosmetic effect. If you really want every skin in the game you can do that without any rng by buying all the easy ones and then using hundreds of guaranteed wardrobe unlocks.
---
A lot of newer players don't especially when the community recommends PoF first for the mounts which are quite useful. Also since there's mounts and a new player doesn't wanna play a HoT elite spec for the time being I can see them getting only PoF.
---
I don´t get it.
---
Her thickly forested cranny.
---
Anet said they're gonna get the devs together and discuss about the complaints. However nothing will be done as it is already too late now. It's almost impossible and kinda humiliating for a company to come out and say " this was completely wrong, we will change it now".. My guess is they will just tank the complaints until the whole thing is swept under the rug.
---
It's more than 4. It's at least 8, assuming there are no time gates in the last few steps nobody has seen yet.
---
There are 5 "meta" achievements, but the third one has it's own time gate.
---
This is assuming you have Charged Quartz. If you don't, you either wait 22 days or spend a lot of gold.
---
I don't have a problem with time gates in general but this one is starting to feel excessive.
---
Hey thanks but I tried that already.. It works through re opens the launcher and same result..
---
I also closed almost everything, discord etc no go :(
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
Honestly I think removing the timegate on feeding is the best they could do at this point (and if there truly is more timegate in 4 and 5 then def remove that ish asap).   
---
Like you said, ships kinda sailed
---
It is not pointless. It is as if you went crafting gen2 legendary with multiple collections. Definitely it is not rushable, and every step will take some time. Places to visit are across whole map and are nicely chosen, stuff to do as well. 
---
But well, I can say it as someone who does not use guides and who reads the hints and searches for it, and enjoys it. For someone who just wants to get reward asap and the process (with huge lore part) is pointless for him, then yea, it is waste of time for him, and then he does not deserve the mount IMO.
---
did you try do delete the bin64 folder in the game folder?
---
Simply because I think the xp lock wasn't intended, same thing happened before and they hotfixed it. It's an easy fix, where the main culprit will alter the design and experience of the whole thing and they probably need to discuss what's the best way to go about it.   
---
As for the outrage some people make money via spirit shards and it makes people who aren't even unlocking the mount kinda salty that they are affected by it.
---
Which path are you using? I tried the ones with springer and didn't reach the top as fast as this one!
---
Well, controlling the skyscale to eat a trail of volatile magic can be a bit tricky if you miss the height, then you will just spend time doing the normal path!
---
Scarabs for example are desert insects. Crystal Oasis has quite a lot of them down south in the waterworks (near the HP).
---
I use a combo of the griffon, the springer, and oakheart to get up on the exterior of the wing. Pretty easy to do.
---
Because legendary armor is far more valuable and useful than a mount which basically has "it's a dragon" the only thing going for it.   
---
Legendary was always meant to showcase peoples dedication and work, much like the griffon which is a "secret/legendary" collection and has a very useful skillset.   
---
Long story short, the mount isn't good enough to warrant this artificial longetivity.
---
there are griffons ingame?
---
I’m so happy with making charged quartz for the past few months ^^ I have plenty ^^ time gate gave me time to do other stuff ^^
---
Yeah, I kinda agree. I rather enjoyed the meta anyway. It's nice when the map has to work together
---
I MUST NOT LET FEAR POISON MY HEART, NOT EVEN IN THIS FORSAKEN WASTELAND.
---
I can only play on weekends at the moment so I rush the content and look at guides because I'm afraid that I need events where a large group of people are needed and that in 4-8 week nobody will do them when I have time to play. That would also be the case if I could play everyday. As you describe, people tend to rush timegated content to increase efficiency and I do because I'm afraid that because it's timegated I have to even longer wait because there will be less people doing it in a few weeks.
---
Thanks, I did check my inventory and bank just to see if I had somehow blindly missing it to no avail, I went ahead and opened the ticket, seems like the best idea. :\[
---
thanks for the tips and info :)
---
I can actually see that point, yeah.   
---
I love when players have to work together across the map, feels engaging and cooperative.
---
kk :)
---
Hit me up in game on Vayne.8563. I can help you figure out the ascended stuff. Probably help if you can hop on discord.
---
i talked to him in sun's refuge but it was old last chapter dialogue
---
&gt; You need to complete living world season 4 story to unlock the mount collection which is Path of Fire
---
that's not what i'm saying.
---
you need all the maps from ls4 not jsut dragonfall's one
---
then try the suggestion from u/Fribbtastic and if this does not help maybe you need to do a clean installation
---
Do you notice the part where I said "in any other game"?
---
But yes, GW2 has had timegates for years. So this immense reaction, to the point of creating comics about it, is baffling.
---
Yeah I didn't want to disregard other posts, but undeniably there were way more about the timegates, visible by the amount of memes about it \^\^ Thanks for sharing your opinion!
---
Where is his suggestion lol can't see it
---
literally the comment below or [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bpo6zu/unable_to_launch_the_game/envllar?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
I haven't played for over 5 years, I only had 8. up to 10 now, but I also have a lot of story content to work through before I even worry about the timegate (and by the time I get there I'll have all the charged quartz that I need anyway)
---
No. You need 12 food in total. You can feed the Skyscale a maximum of 3 food per day. In over 4 days.
---
No, it's not, but it is still an MMO and timegates are par for the course in this genre - par for the course even in GW2 itself.
---
Also, FFXIV's Veteran Rewards program is now based on achievement points and has nothing to do with subscription time.
---
25 is nothing. I did it in 2 days without even farming the achievement specifically. If you play less, that's okay, it's okay for an achievement to take a couple of weeks in which you casually find a bridge every so often.
---
Skyscales don't grow from zero to hero overnight.
---
Thank god.
---
I have around 1k charged quartz on my alt-accounts. I will just make grow lamps and be happy :D
---
Others told me that is 4 foods per day in over 3 days =/. Doesnt mater at least I know how it works now . Thanks.
---
&gt; Irrelevant in the grand scheme. Mistakes happen, and as a result of this one they created a proper test for similar shit so it shouldn't happen again in the future.
---
I'm just amazed it managed to happen at all. What kind of testing were they doing to even involve a T-bow at all? If I recall correctly, it was involving the farming guild, which doesn't even have combat lol. Even RS3 devs at least do testing with basic cabbages.
---
Because of that mistake, I lost a good chunk of Agility levels too that I just happened to felt like grinding out that day. Wasn't anywhere near that place nor even knew about the T-bow until after the server shutdown...
---
Tbh imo that would make it even less worth, what I love about GW2 mounts is the fact that they designed them to be so interesting and useful. Fact of the matter is when we get the mastery it will be more enjoyable and effective using the skyscale, but just allowing full flight would break the whole thing. Would break other mounts and their mount system itself.   
---
The ONLY issue here is the timegate, remove it and the mount is worth and balanced. I'd much rather they adress the acquisition than break everything just to accommodate it
---
Could fit well as a theory for what happens when you don't tackle a [xeno'jiiva](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/monsterhunter/images/2/2f/MHW-Xeno%27jiiva_Render_001.png/revision/latest?cb=20190412154741) when it hatches, too.
---
So you are kinda gated twice - first because they made raids inaccessible and second time because even with raiding you need a lot of time, right?
---
The irony is that people who *do* spend a huge amount of time playing the game are busy... playing the game. They're not here to do non-content scavenger hunts - they're here to WvW, sPvP, raid, or do fractals. The only "long term content" that meshes with the Skyscale collections is legendary crafting, but not everyone is into that.
---
So they're trying to coerce people to play the game more by forcing them through garbage content (I'm sure that'll end well) and dragging the people who *do* play the game more away from the reasons why they enjoy the game.
---
Fair point... though if mount is not so good, why everyone needs it on day 1?
---
Lol , my friends and guild mates wish the listened to me when I told them I was going to make some charged quartz, if anyone wanted to join ^^
---
It's just farming with engi's
---
I ‘rushed’ the griffon and it took me two weeks to complete... i dread having to do months just for the skyscale if what you say is true .-.
---
Its not that i want the rewards asap, its just that i can -at best- play 4 hours a weekend, but i would like to spend most of that playing with friends (who sadly dont play gw2, i tried)
---
If i were to appoint 1 hour per week to get the skyscale, it would already take months, but if the food is time gated... i read 12 days of time gate?, that alone is 12 weeks for me...
---
I would agree with the negative comments when the skyscale hat that much of an impact or would be necessary to gameplay more than it actually is. In fact, I see it as clunky and while it was fun to try it out a bit I still use Springer and Griffon more. The "latching to a vertical surface" was more annoying than helpful but this probably will change when I get the last mastery for the skyscale with the launching mechanism while being "latched on".
---
Collections are and were always annoying for me. Though, they give me something to do and If I can't progress then that is okay for me because then I can do it the next time I want to.
---
Pretty much 100% my personal opinion really, but it used to be zones weren't so utterly centred around meta-events (the big, zone-wide events that lead up to a boss, sometimes with lanes and everything that necessitate grouping up and coordination to succeed).
---
Don't get me wrong, I like meta events themselves, though when I started playing, it used to be there'd be a meta event every now and then, with most dynamic events being just that - little things happening in the zones that informed the local story, like the Flame Legion attacking various parts of Ascalon, as a basic example. 
---
Ever since Silverwastes, there's been a much greater emphasis (again, IMO) on those zone-spanning spectacles, and while they can be fun, I think a little something was lost along the way. That said, you're coming from a much fresher perspective than I am, it could just be nostalgia talking. :p
---
You should really check what you can make with them....I make 500-600g with like 300 of them...
---
So instead of them making them more re-playable you advocate for a shitty timegate everybody hates all within a map where if you don't do the collection you have basically fuck all to do? 
---
Like maybe you need somebody to stop you and say "nono you'll get burned out" but a lot of us sure as hell don't. This is juvenile af, the problem is with the amount of content in the LWS and not the "players burning through it". If this is the case with every single LWS then it's pretty safe to say the system doesn't fucking work m8.   
---
Who the hell would play a game with little content that is timegated so to "stretch it out", sure as hell didn't work out for WoW and it doesn't work for GW2 either.
---
scrub learn to play the game gg boosted :\^) behehe  
---
  
---
((on side note agree with all. This collection is annoying to me as Raid armor prov. tokens but each day getting something done with dailies is not that bad. In the end, it is a few days only and I will have it eventually eh))
---
Absolutely this, I would without an issue grind out the 300 events until I get it because that's how I like to do things, meanwhile the guy who will have to wait 3 months for it would possible get it in 1 month.   
---
Player choice is ALWAYS a good thing.   
---
"But then you'd complain you have nothing to do!"  
---
Maybe because they ARE little content for what, a 3-4 month wait.
---
Hardly does damage either.
---
The mount itself is good (if only we could actually obtain it)
---
The meta and map to me was the highlight. It is like a combination of DS, Silverwaste and the meta boss a bit of AB. I should congratulate everyone on the team who made this living story possible (except for the people who made the collection... why?)
---
Well, that's your problem.
---
The next one your gonna do is feeding the skyscale for 4 days and some smaller collections alongside it. Basically if you do those in 1 day (they really don't take long) you'll have 3 days of just clicking F to feed (and having to craft/buy that food ofc).   
---
It's a lot of uninteresting waiting around
---
What exactly can ypu craft with em?
---
Thanks I hate it
---
I really don't know why charged quartz acquisition even has a timegate to this day, theres is nothing to my knowledge that would need limiting it like that. It even limits you in celestial armor/weapon stat acquisition. Takes 30 days for full set of armor, it doesn't make sense.
---
Just removing that would make a big difference. People who play regularly prolly have charged quartz, but people who don't usually don't have the gold required to buy grow lamps. Which means is that you're limiting casual people from acquiring skyskale to around 30 days of timegating.
---
To be fair absolutely nobody has an issue with the massive collection and only those who grind hard would have it in a day, it's only the timegate that's the heavily disliked requirement.   
---
Don't think anybody expected it to be roller beetle levels of easy, but also not sadistic timegate within a timegate within a timegate design.
---
Thanks for your help.
---
My OS is freshly installed and my nvidia driver is up to date. I dont really like tool like CCleaner for different reasons so this is not a solution for me. Besides it wouldnt have much effect on my system i guess. Maybe i try to install gw completly new... maybe this will do the tick....
---
You like to work for free? Good for you.
---
What do you make? I got 5k spare spirit shards...
---
It's doing the exact opposite of "play the way you like", maybe that's why your opinion will get downvoted.
---
that was an huge mistake
---
Wouldn't capitalism be the better analogy?
---
I feel like there’s also a bit of AB meta mixed in, considering you need to coordinate taking out the legendaries. At least it’s still more forgiving than TT!
---
Welcome to Guild Wars 1
---
The main point being the skyscale IS the content, you can do everything apart from it in 2-3 days. Kind of a mute point there  
---
Just because you don't care for it doesn't mean others don't, just how others don't give a shit about the meta or armor or have already done all of it.
---
I finished the map before Dragonfall (Thunderhead Keep) the other day as I'm catching up with the LW and I had no idea about this. I did think something was missing from the rewards, big regret.
---
Well I suppose you can't play under the week? So yeah be happy because it will take you just a few weeks to unlock the mount.
---
I took screenshots of the eggs physically (not from the map), if that would be helpful to anyone.

the first queens gauntlet was a year after release? what are you on about?  
---
asc weapons and armor where introduced afterwards and exotic trinkets vs asc is not that big difference. or do you mean having random exotic pieces instead of all of the same stat?  
---
i did it on a fullzerk rifle warrior and kited 24/7 and made it...on a *rifle warrior*. do you know how much dps a rifle warrior without might deals? and it was enough.
---
I tried out a few classes in T1/T2 with gimped gear (Berserker trinkets I already have to meet AR + TP exotics).  These included DPS Tempest (squish AF in suboptimal groups, lightning overload finicky), Druid (probably needed to learn the abilities more), DPS Renegade (didn't click with me), Scourge (same as Renegade).  Some of the things I haven't tried include DPS Dragonhunter/Firebrand, healer Firebrand/Renegade/Tempest, Weaver.  I tend to like classes that run a ranged weapon on at least one bar and classes that are a bit more chill in terms of APM/active abilities.  Any suggestions on what to try?

 "Commander, a word"

 ''You break it, I break you''
---
Yeah you are on Griffon most of the time and you don't really get aggro unless you are slow. There are couple of PoIs that you can get aggro but using Griffon evade will save you. I usually went with a Guardian as their starter heal is a block which can save you in emergencies.
---
There is also one PoI at where Leyline Anomaly spawns that usually kills you, but at that point I usually need to backtrack to Airship waypoint and get the last 2 PoIs below.
---
Other than that its 5 minutes for the whole run. I used to do this with the TP to friend charges I got from achi rewards and BLCs, but it won't be possible now. 
---
I might give Dry Top a try though. It doesn't have any hearts and only one heart requires you to fight and I can ask someone to help me with that. It depends on whether I can complete a heart with 0 damage.
---
So what if you’re me and went for Sunrise instead?
---
Anet somewhat miscommunicated and I'd guess that is part of why the community has such issues with it. It's similar to Aurora (not quite as grindy, ofc) and I think people had the expectation to get this mount on a silver plate instead of having to put some effort into it. Quite unfortunate.
---
I must say, apart from the timegates and charged crystals, this is an outstanding collection sequence so far and I am having a blast, it leads me back to old places and is generally fun. I hope Anet does more of this (without timegates or nullification sigils) but communicates the effort involved a little better.
---
That's granted by one of the masteries, so no worries there
---
You should also throw a anchor on it aswell. The damn thing barely flies an inch
---
Ipos that low? And dreamer not F tier?
---
It's 100% confirmed and known? There was like a 1,5h stream about it  
---
1st is mounting midair (basic QoL, fully expected), 2nd is those rift paths (niche and gimmick, nobody really cares) and 3rd is jump up while wall hanging (uses stamina, doesn't give more flight juice).   
---
The only thing stupid here is your ill-informed post.   
---
**"Being able to escape all the land mobs that crowd the ground and float in safety anywhere? That seems pretty high impact to me."**  
---
Going by the rent-a-scales on the map naw, your gonna aggro pretty much everything you can't fly that high. You have to scale the mountains just like with the griffon and you'll do it slower, aka a jackal is way better if avoiding enemies is your goal, griffon+rabbit or just rabbit if you wanna do it vertically.

Fuckin loving it!!!

Imagine picking up a heavily story-driven MMO while being the sort of person who hates story quests.
---
Same, I became so enthralled with HoT maps, I just went around them for days, exploring literally everything and memorizing the whole layout. And the payoff is so great - I can navigate Tangled Depths with my eyes closed, and be in any part of it in less than a minute - for example, it's faster to travel to Nuhoch Lane for meta from Order of Whispers waypoint than it is from Ley-Line Confluence, I can be there in less than 25 seconds.   
---
Don't have that eagerness for PoF maps.
---
Getting full exotic (and then ascended) viper kit for my condi ranger took *so long* and felt like such a huge accomplishment.
---
no , the post was from  4 months ago-   [https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ac6qcy/new\_pf\_player\_cant\_reach\_any\_mastery\_points/ed67krf/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ac6qcy/new_pf_player_cant_reach_any_mastery_points/ed67krf/)
---
Actually this was shown in stream about skyscale before the release. It spawns the trail of orbs that you can collect and it recharges your range.
---
Different maps have different reasons to go to. A mount, again, is ONE aspect of an living world episode. I'd buy them mount or no mount anyway. If you're ONLY getting them for the mount, then  you have the option of farming gold to buy the episodes necessary, in the same way you have the option to do that with a griffon. You don't have to farm gold for a griffon. You can break out your credit card, buy gems and sell them for gold. Either way, it amounts to the same thing.
---
Those who want to spend money to support the game can do do. Those who would rather farm gold, can do that.
---
And those who don't want the mount, they're welcome to not have it.
---
If you want it, get the stuff you need to get it, like every other game in existence.
---
You seem to labor under the assumption that this game is somehow more punishing than others. It doesn't have a sub. The game is as cheap as fuck, particularly when it's on sale. They give away the living story season free to regular players, and it's not pay to win. They even give people the option to farm gold and buy LS episodes instead of pay for them, so the pay wall is only a grind wall if you already own PoF and you don't want to pay.
---
This is one of the fairest of all the games I've played as far as cash shop/subs go. It's a good  business decision because this game has been successful so far, when so many other MMOs released in the same time frame are struggling.
---
Since when can't you rely on personal sources in a research. Who would know better than the community.
---
With the hotfix to PoF EXP does that mean if I am in the middle of the Skyscale collections (for example the Day2 collections going into Day3) would I be able to get EXP in PoF zones to get spirit shards? Just needed some clarification is all.
---
I recommend using either action camera or holding right mouse and steering with camera. But yeah, I still miss some at times, but it's alright
---
If you want a casual game, with no endgame or challanges what so ever with a heavy focus on skins which you can only get by paying with $$$, because the ingame obtainable skins are super low effort to encourage the pay shop, then yea go for it!
---
You don't have to fear of being overwhelmed, this game is catered towards the most braindead SJW, who likes to play dress up with his armor skins which it bought for 20$ a piece.
---
&gt; Hey guys, there have been probably a lot of people asking this.

I am glad to see that no one disagrees with gen2 torch on lowest rank. No idea what they were thinking with when they added this birthday cake.
---
To others it is, for me it is because it's literally the only thing I was looking forward to. I don't see how is this a hard concept to grasp.   
---
I did everything else and now I'm back to doing everything I always do when there is no new LWS. So as others pointed out very eloquently, the timegate only makes people salty and benefits nobody.   
---
I mean if you don't care about it all the more power to you, but in the same respect others might not care about what you care, doesn't mean we should drag each other down.

As a WoW veteran who decided to come back to Guild Wars 2 (I played in the beta and early Vanilla) a month ago, let me say I'm loving it. The horizontal progression of this game is what was the deciding factor of me giving this game another try. I've also been enjoying the story quite a lot (I just finished the HoT main story). That being said, if you are looking to be ultimate support I recommend playing Chrono Mesmer (hard to master) or Druid. I personally play Mesmer and love it. You will need the HoT expansion in order to get those specialisations though, but I recommend getting both if you like the game, they are worth it. Speaking of server, just play on EU, there is no reason to play on US if you are in EU. The game is alive and doing well in both regions.
---
&gt; In a sense, with horizontal progression you do not feel as if you are progressing at all.
---
That's where the shiny comes in... and where taste determines what's worth grind for.  There's a lot of complaining about the collection for the Skyscale, but.... you don't actually *need* it for map completion.  The way the rental handles doesn't incentivize the collection, and aesthetically... well, I could put that time into WvW and come out with a gear skin I actually like the the look of.
---
They couldve had such a sweet thing if they used the rift system they recently put out to port you to the next boss. Then just have each rift send you to a random boss, or to a set list, and each one is just harder than the next. Sucks to have to rush to a specific one to get the achi done with or else wait another hour and change to try.
---
Personally, aside from the timegates, I actually like the collections.
---
you always have longer with a timer. Let the timer be 24 hours. Now with the daily reset you basicaly have a day to complete the new collection. If you have a timer you feel even more rushed to complete it because the new timer starts as soon as you completed that part of the collection. On top of that you have to play on as soon as the old timer runs out. With dailies I think it's way better (actually the best way) to do it. Especially cause you don't need to keep track of random timers that are in diffrent collections.
---
Definitely the game for your time schedule.
---
You can play on and off perfectly fine. Even though the most things are "once a day you can get daily big bonus for doing this certain thing", so playing regularly is worth it, if you don't, you don't lose any progress. The "everything is still relevant" is pretty much true.
---
The biggest "mandatory" login is like 3 month period when major updates launch, if you login in that period you get them free (otherwise you have to spend some ingame gold or premium currency - but those new releases are available after buying expansions anyways)
---
For region, if you have no bounds, go with geograpic one so you have best ping possible. EU region is more alive anyways, and has way more players than US.
---
For co-op, no voice inside the game, but that is nowadays not really an issue, with Discord/teamspeak etc gettable basically for free, with overlays, etc.
---
Class: Play whatever you like. **You can try out all the classes by getting level 3** (so basically finishing tutorial and playing for a bit), **enter PvP lobby and test all the skills there**, as PvP is standardized in equipment and actions available. Then you can delete character and go try another one, if you like. Once you buy expansion, it is pretty easy to get enough character slots to have all the classes. Game is extremely alt-friendly, a lot of stuff is account shared.
---
Compared to WoW, you will have great experience with your schedule, and you will actually play with people everywhere, even in starting areas. So feel free to try it out.
---
This is amazing! Probably one of the best cosplays I've seen. Good job op!
---
Excel is your best friend as a game dev.
---
I made this for a few of my friends to help them through the first Skyscale collections. It's not 100% accurate, but it's close enough that they found most of them with minimal trouble.
---
I personally think it's much easier to have a map like this than piece together screenshots. I hope it helps some people still starting on their Skyscales to catch up a little faster!
---
Happy hunting, everyone!
---
I CAN OUTRUN A CENTAUR!
---
People still bitch - strenuously - about how expensive the Griffon is.  Despite the fact there's no other purchase in the game with that kind of value.
---
Anet didn't create the bitchy entitled gamer who wants to get paid just for showing up - they're in every multiplayer title on the market.  They *do* set some odd standards for access, though - it seems like the more you have to work for something the more optional it is.
---
That doesn't make the point that from a story point of view it makes perfectly sense to have the collection work with a timegate. On top I think the collection is one of the best ones we have seen so far, with good visuals also on old maps where you need to go. Great descriptions , and overall a nice story behind.
---
Realistically, the game can be complex and there is a possibility for feeling overwhelmed, especially when the game opens up and branches out into all the things you could be doing.
---
The thing to always remember to ground you is that they don’t need to be rushed, they don’t all need to be done at all, and it is possible to slowly learn the game one wiki entry and gameplay session at a time.
---
If you’re having fun at the basic level of running around the maps and pressing random keys to kill things, the rest can be built on in good time.
---
that goes back to what i said though, no matter how much they can get out of you, they can always get 10 x more out of a whale with a gambling addiction, of which there is no shortage. it takes less effort and makes more money to design lootboxes to prey upon gambling addicts and people susceptible to impulse purchasing rather than making a fair system, sure a fair system could be profitable but it would never be *as* profitable as a predatory system.
---
It was bugged on a couple maps, but I managed to find a taxi to a map where it wasn't bugged. I remember ip 155 being a bugged one.
---
They don't even bother making armor, which respect the players character model, everything clips with through the tail of charrs or with their hair. 
---
But IF they make a gemstore skin for 20$, then all of a sudden they are able to prevent clipping.
---
*Cough* Mawdrey *Cough*.
---
Makes the Henge look like the Inquest backpack.  Sure, you could buy your way through the timegating, and people are doing that with the Skyscale, but overwrought collections are... kind of a core feature of the game.
---
I was one of those people who thought Dulfy was a team/company of people but clearly there is a single point of failure for the entire site. Does make it all the more impressive.
---
And this isn't a temper tantrum?   
---
At least the other posts have actual criticism instead of literally saying "TY ANET" in an essay and complaining about the other threads with no actual argument other than "I don't like negative opinions!"  
---
Also straight up lying in half of the post isn't exactly helping this thread.
---
And how about diminishind returns?
---
yeah i was expecting something ....not like Mouth of M. ...but something
---
Hopefully NCSoft made these points when they knocked Anet upside the head earlier this year.  With the entire company (allegedly) focused on the game maybe we'll see an uptick in the pace of content development.
---
We really need a bot to answer these questions.
---
Fresh Air Tempest. High prot uptime, very good damage, mobility, and defensive skills like sandstorm, arcane shield etc. Can sometime deal damage while not beeing hit (Fiery GS spin into walls, sandstorm and slap them during blind time etc). You can play dagger for melee cleave, scepter for a bit ranged, warhorn for both in offhand. Staff if you want to leech metas.
---
To be fair. I've got 2 special mount skins out of BLC for a fraction of Gems I had to use to buy the skins directly.
---
Not that I spend hundreds of dollar every month on keys... I tend to stay away from these as much as I can (think I bought keys on 2 occasions during my almost 7 years of GW2) but the times I've tried, I always got something valuable out of it.
---
But I was probably just lucky.
---
Rng isn't a time gate.  You could get it on your first run.  A time gate however, guarantees it takes the time.
---
As I said in other thread
---
&gt;As a non gemstore skin it must be flawed in some ways.
---
Thanks! I feel like I could do better on presentation, but I wanted to get it out there for people asap.
---
h-holy fuck
---
this + the sexy legy GS... just made me decide to download the client again
---
i love fashion wars so much
---
It might not have been a factor for you, but for many in the playerbase 250g was definitely a timegate
---
Well I hope this helps you out!
---
Honestly the daunting part starts once you've finished this collection, but finishing it was like a weight off my shoulders knowing I've at least made a dent in it.
---
It really depends on the person and collection. Picking up a bunch of scales and eggs on the new map? No thanks. It's boring and I hate it but I'm sure there are people that liked it.
---
I had a lot of fun with the Astralaria and Chuka and Champawat collection. I had fun with the legendary armour collection. I had fun with ad infinitum and I'm sure there are people that hated these.
---
GW2 is a game that doesn't really only start when you get to max level, it is also a game that requires you to understand the game and your profession. The more you understand the better you will be in the game.
---
With that being said, the game gradually teaches you the basic mechanics like different types of skills, your traits and so on. This basically allows you to learn them step by step, adjusting traits to how you want to play, using different skills to change up your synergy or playstyle and so on. Taking the shortcut to level 80 will bypass that and you will be confronted with everything at once which many players will feel overwhelmed with (and quite frankly you could have found the same answer to if you would have searched the subreddit first).
---
Some players are able to do this and even like to do it this way. Others can't. Personally, play the content how it is supposed to be played. That also means to not create a character, using the boost on it to get gliding and the raptor mount and then starting your actual character. While Mounts and gliding are damn awesome, the Content you play while levelling is not made for them and you will cheat out on a lot of things that make the content good. For example, you will get used to preventing fall damage because you have the glider which will not work in jumping puzzles in which you need precise jumps. The Maps will feel incredible small when you explore them with a mount and some areas won't even be dangerous because you can just dash past the enemies with the raptor.
---
Just play the game without any shortcut, GW2 uses a horizontal progression and you will roughly take the same time for each level and not increasingly more. Level 80 is reached quickly. Use the Boost on your second of even third character.
---
I was thinking that you can only loot the raids once a week being the time gate.
---
one of the most underrated little features ppl dont acknowledge in GW2.
---
Is this a method to do it without needing the entire lws4?
---
power firebrand is meta. if you really need a healer in fractals then renegade is the go to.
---
Yep, haven't touched it in a couple years.  Wow disgusts me, but only because if how much I loved it back in bc.
---
I'm going to give a different answer than a lot of people in this thread, which is, it depends. What it depends on is your ability to adapt to your current situation.
---
There's no game where you can play casually and get everything quickly. If you're used to being a content locust in another game and you suddenly have less time, you're going to have to make an adjustment to the way you approach the game. There's no two ways about that.
---
This is a great casual game, and probably the best game for people who don't have a lot of time. But instead of approaching the game as  goal oriented I have to get this, you'd be best to enjoy this game as a journey rather than a destination. It's designed for that anyway. 
---
So much of this game is just the pleasure of moving through a world that feels like it's alive, whether through beautiful artwork or ambient sounds, or background npc dialogue, much of which is voiced. There's so much to see and do and explore without worrying about getting BIS gear really fast, which you don't need for most of the game anyway.
---
If you can slow yourself down and take a stroll through Tyria, this can be one of the best games on the market. 
---
But if you're just going to look around and wonder why you can't have things quicker, there's no game that's going to fill that void.
---
I'm retired and I have all the time in the world, but I still find myself in awe of the basic design of the core game, and the open world.
---
Actually, today they at least changed the Skyscale masteries to work like the raid masteries, so we can now see how much xp we have towards the next spirit shard again, so I've gotta applaud them for that, even though it sucked that it was a problem in the first place. I still wish they would remove the top-level timegating (that is, having to wait a day between finding the scales and finding the sick Skyscales, and then another day between that and finding the eggs and so on). I'm fine with the lower level timegating (charging ~~J.O.~~ quartz crystals, feeding Skyscales, etc.), as long as that's not further limited by higher level timegates. I just want to be able to do the scavenger hunt stuff in DF from the first few days and then get to doing the newer stuff with everyone else at my own pace, without having to wait a day each to even start the separate scavenger hunt steps.
---
You're right that not many companies would come right out and say "we done goofed," but Anet is not most companies (although NCSoft is). Plus they have ways of saying "we messed up" and fixing it without explicitly saying so and without losing face with NCSoft, shareholders, and investors. Just saying "based on player feedback, we decided to blahblahblah" gets the point across while giving Anet plausible deniability and looking even better to some people.
---
I wish Anet were able to timegate resurrection of Aurine. 10 min of onscreen death and whole panel dedicated to character death... well here goes dignity of modern art.
---
I just wish they would stop using that horrid postprocessing filter on every map made after Draconis Mons :/ Or at least let us switch between the core, HoT and LS3+ filters.
---
Lmao, this timegate has virtually no effect on the GW2 playerbase in the grand scheme of things.
---
While on a rented Skyscale 
---
Go to heroes tab -&gt; dye -&gt; mount tab

---
Ah continuing to argue with someone because you disagree with their opinion instead of just saying you disagree, the tell tale sign of a GW2 Redditor! So laying off 1/3 of the company must be a sign of success in your world!!
---
Yup. Typical condescending asshole.
---
I had Dire Crab build for RA back in the day. It was such a trap... Just remembering all chat spam from enemy Monks about "KILLLL THE CRAAAB ! ! !@#!#!@" makes me smile.
---
That really isn't any different compared to needing to do Golem MkII or the Leyline event for the Beetle unlock, though.
---
It's also not like Desert Highlands is a dead map either. With a little good will and effort you'll be able to collect some people together in a party/squad to get this event chain done, no problem.
---
But you can watch netflix while doing riba. I mean what is the point if you still have to be at your pc? Just because it is a little bit easier? If it would be allowed to be afk then I would understand it.
---
ArenaNet should forbid this sort of farming fully.
---
I really hope this image can make it to information sites or the wiki.

Appreciate your hard work for putting the guide together. Thank you!

People may not complain, but if you do abnormally low DPS as a BS and are wielding a GS &amp; Axe/Axe and CC is bad tensions will rise.
---
So true it hurts
---
We don't, but we can theorize.
---
I think that it leads to the fact that all of the elder dragons and their aspects of magic were once whole and balanced in their "mother". Some event happened (probably involving the six human gods) that split all the aspects of magic from the "mother" to create the six elder dragons we know. 
---
In his last moments it looks like Kralkatorrik sees his mother in Aurene and calls for her.
---
Then why are we even having this conversation if you are just gonna go "your a dick!" instead of reading and using your brain?   
---
If you informed me right away that your a casual who's arguing about content he doesn't know anything about nor is he participating in it I would have saved my breath.   
---
Keep trying dear heart, you'll get there one day and until then stop complaining that everybody else is faster than you ;)  
---
It's quite obvious from your posts that you were trying to start shit and not "simply asking questions", if you were you wouldn't get so triggered by my comment, so you can kindly fuck off.
---
YOU MUST LIKE PAIN!
---
a guide is def not needed to do the collection, ive done the beetle and griphon without guides. how do you think the first people who will have the skyscale get them? do you think they followed a guide?
---
needing a guide to do a collection is just plain laziness on your part.
---
I would recommend doing the 10 events in each area for medicine first and grabbing any scales you find along way if you want to save time, but sick skyscales and eggs are unlocked one after another after the Scales and Medicine, so you'll have to wait to do those.
---
medium armour
---
Your loss then. I hate farming so I make my money this way. Saved like 500g and started making my money this way, now I have a steady income, can buy more than 3k gems each time, have all the res ready for next leggy and still 400g left. While I accumulate more shards and obsidian shards through pvp/wvw, I have almost all other things necessary. 
---
Dunno what your farming problem has to do with this though *rolls eyes*
---
The best moment to do those is at meta reset, just give 2-3 peices at each event to tag it and fly away to the next one to be sure to tag all/most of them. Then when I had nothing more to do I took my Beetle and did laps around the map and the bridges to find defenses more efficiently than waiting at a specific bridge. I started doing that when I had done only 5 and it took me a few hours to finish it while also doing the meta (because there is no defense to do during that time) and without doing instance hopping. Time was spent was not too bad because it is actually very enjoyable to do laps on this map with the Beetle :p
---
Mainly because we want a statement from the devs and are currently interested in them addressing our concerns, don't really care about a guild chat featuring the mount atm, just developer response and possible fix.   
---
That's why the 24th isn't soon enough.
---
This would annoy me. There are certain I won't wear due to similar issues like these.
---
If anybody complete SW or D'Top and can share what's happening there. Thanks. They are LSW2 map but they are avaible for accounts with no expansion too. So, these maps are puzzling my mind. Both Living World and non Living World for me.
---
I think you need fukken shoes is what I think!
---
Thanks
---
Best use of this meme so far
---
Then she rallies the troops and literally fix the whole situation, while dealing with other problems too.
---
While we literally tag along. Not the other way around.
---
Paint it either way you want, but she got shit done.
---
Play how you want. I don't care, but as soon as people abuse this and afk farm I do care.
---
And you know this is the route people will take and then anet will do something about it and in some direct way will affect the people that didn't abuse the system and that includes you. Who isn't afk farming.
---
If you say so. I guess I will never even approach level of those, who have enough money to start gaining money from leggies.
---
Realistically we can't mount a full scale offense in an hour either, nor pitch multiple camps everywhere on top of a dragon corpse that just crashed. So in other words, thematically, it doesn't matter. 
---
It's not done in a day, but having to wait around doing nothing but clicking F once a day for 3 days? No, just no.
---
Fuckin' bourgeoise Tyrians and their bare feet.
---
This is... Really specific.
---
just looks really stupid imo xD
---
You know damn well what he means, it's basically as inactive as you can get without being fully afk.
---
Yeah, keep petting their heads and watch where the game will end up...
---
Does it count as a gamble when it's a 100% drop rate?
---
&gt; And I am not alone.
---
yeah, tell yourself that.
---
&gt; If it had all the specs of the Griff AND the other additions
---
that would make the griffon obsolet. do you really dont understand that?
---
Gotcha, thanks.
---
So you didn't read the post either?
---
&gt; you can't explore with only the base game, but that doesn't mean there isn't a whole lot to discover in the **base game**
---
Does it have a bladetrail?
---
they just cant have the same level. guild A can have t2 and guild B tier 4.
---
but Guild A and guild B cant have both tier 1,2,3 or 4.
---
Done daily Tequatl for probably around 80% of the days and I don't even have half of the skins and there are people out there with significantly worse luck than me!
---
I feel like siege turtles and underwater dont mix well, we never saw it in GW1.
---
He's not alone. Fuck this shit.
---
Because of people downvoting me like they're doing to you I have to pull out some screenshot karma grabs so I can keep commenting in this sub

If it's not worth it for you, just don't get it whats the point of complaining. The Legendaries of second generations are just skins if already have the first gen ones. They don't have enough perks to make them worth it and are behind huge collections as well. Do I complain on reddit nope I just didn't get them.
---
When HoT came out. I didn't bitch, whine and moan. I simply shouted in guild chat "yo guildies, who wants to join me in a dash against Tyria to collect hero point" 
---
And we just went and did it.
---
Skyscale has come out and all I read on Reddit, twitter and Facebook is the meaning and whining about the time gate.
---
The collection looks really fun to do and I think I'm going to really enjoy doing it. But like chuka leggy how collection.
---
Why does everyone **WANT EVERYTHING NOW**
---
Actually, no. All timegating does is remind me there's other things to play and decreases my desire to play GW2. So in my particular scenario (and while I'm sure I may be in a minority for this, but maybe not - we don't have the exact numbers) timegating actively decreases my enjoyment of the game and desire to return the next day to do the very thing I'm being prevented from doing.
---
That's part of the problem with relying on timegating as a form of getting players to log in daily. There's so many high quality games on the market, much less "just" good ones, that it becomes baffling that A-Net wants to prevent anyone from doing exactly what they want them to do: play their game. Telling the player "no, you're progressing too fast for today" doesn't really cut it anymore. We can just play other games, and it's really disappointing, because GW2, *when we're allowed to actually play the game*, is legitimately fun. It's not fun being told to screw off until tomorrow.
---
bohoo.
---
I'm amazed you managed to not include yourself failing at basic maths this time.
---
there's a big difference between the skyscale collection and having only one person in an entire meta spanning half a map being able to get a certain drop that isn't tradable in any way shape or form and also doesn't drop if you don't have the necessary achievement progress
---
Agreed. It's something they could do since you are crafting 2 legendary weapons and ending up with one.
---
Nobody forces you to do it. If you don't want it, then don't go for it. It is THAT easy. 
---
But honestly, you will miss out on the progression, on the lore, on story that you could be part of... 
---
But^2 , if you decide such just on the size and amount of time it needs to do....I hope you will never want to try go for legendaries, they are on same tier of needs. Don't ever dare about it. You will nope out of it faster than from here. 
---
And after all...I will feel twice rewarded if my hard work will be paid by *exclusive content* that not everyone has. Because they were lazy or they found first minor thing to complain about and run away.
---
Personal story can get you up to 80 in a day. Tedious and maybe boring for some but it works if you've got time to kill. I've done it for 2 in the last few months , on separate days.
---
I've been playing through the FFXIV MSQ (up to just before Stormblood now) and it's been one of the most boring experiences of my life. The story is pretty average like most MMOs but the content itself is even worse. It improves after 1-50 but even after it's a slog to get through. The main meat of the content in FFXIV is the duty/raid side of things and getting to that is very painful.
---
you have a degree of camera control, also hold jump to raise and... idk the default binding; mine is Q to lower independent of camera angle
---
But all that is fundamentally pointless as they aren't sick but are in fact just aging to fast due to them being the first generation and created from magic during Kalks fall. He literally tells you that getting the medicine and providing it to the "sick" skyscales was pointless and they just made you run around for nothing.
---
Thanks for telling me. It doesn't make sense that we can kill dhuum more than once! 
---
(It's just to point out that I don't get your out of context argument:))
---
Any higher resolution of the first picture??
---
Um, we already know that xP

We already know the masteries. You can't see them anymore but they're on the wiki.
---
* The new GS is entirely subjective. I was impressed by it turning into a shield for ranger gs 4. The rest is meh to me.
---
* I agree the new map looks incredible and it's easily my favourite map from the whole expansion. What rewards though? I didn't notice anything worthwhile so far.
---
* I agree with the story I enjoyed it too.
---
* I haven't looked into the new armour set but I've heard good things so far so I'm looking forward to that!
---
* I won't comment on the mount lmao.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Skyscale#Related_masteries
---
I'd argue that you that nobody can judge that at this point. The point of the immersion they do with the timegate is to get attached to the mount. But can you really judge if you obviously don't have the mount yet? You guys are telling how the journey was before you even started it. I guess this discussion needs to be held when people actually have the mount.
---
I would have said it was the opposite. If there has been hostility  towards those who don't m,ind the timegating its been after they have expressed disdain or worse to those complaining. I've lost count of the number of posts calling those complaining lazy or entitled or wanting things handed on a platter.
---
I'd say of the 3, heavy has the most revealing options. Light and medium need more naked options too!
---
Really wish we were able to do this even if it did cost another 500 gold and 50 Transmutaiton Charges... or 3000 gold and 300 Transmutation Charges... the greatsword itself is amazing but the inability to lock one of its aspects keeps bothering me for two years already. I hope someone from Anet at least answers something in this thread to get any resolution.
---
Thank you!
---
Vs this thing that is already so? Feh
---
Imagine wanting to play an MMO for the actual multiplayer aspect of the game and literally having to do ALL the main story then grinding for timegated gear before being allowed into the current content at all.
---
there's a few collection items ( it those in this map, but other stuff) you have to buy. so far I'm still below 10 gold, might cost more later on though. 
---
a few items you need you either craft with a daily timegated material (charged quartz) or buy, and right now it's very expensive to buy straight up. if you're in no rush, just wait until the first people finish to see how much it costs in total. meanwhile, make sure to convert your daily 25 quartz into charged ones, so you can craft the glow lamp yourself instead of buying it overpriced on the TP.
---
I have done collections on the release day and was one searching for eggs in the squad (and was 20min late on my daily reset tho). Griffon was pretty easy compared to this bonanza. Like I can understand 40 item collection ALONGSIDE with other activities like crafting, doing specific events and gathering map currency.
---
I do not understand intensive to make it something in line with

---
Or Aurora collection with collection size 200+, witch is by all means optional content and not "Ride your dragon in this episode"
---
Even if you're already playing it's still super painful. Only if you're actively keeping up with quests.
---
Not really going to complain, If they are that short sighted to lock content and force people to grind for it. Then we have moved into a game that will lose players.
---
This guy is actually doing good thing, even though methods are unusual. Since countless reports and writing to support doesn't help with elimination of afk farming, maybe spamming social media with baits like that will finally make anet find the solution.
---
Problem is mods remove those threads so people don't see them and don't push anet enough to step in.
---
We want it shiny!
---
Your either afk or not. AWAY FROM KEYBOARD or minimized. This is not a war thread this is a farm thread.

i have the heavy version, has 3 dye channels, i think its just oversight, submit a bug report.

the top part of the greaves on the heavy one dyes , just a bug on light
---
LMFTFY:  
---
\- Kind regards, E
---
Jobroni you are the Boni, thank you.
---
Well, If people do not complain then they do whatever they want whenever they want.  There is a reason EA stopped their bullshit with the lootboxes ( for the time being) 
---
So by all means, don't complain.. ever .. it's what they want..
---
This is probably my favourite meta since Silverwastes. It's got so much going on through it, it's rewarding and the map is really nicely designed.
---
Did you really just say that Tangled Depths depths being tangled doesn't work well with the map?
---
Yes, and you could select HoT stats on it like Viper's, Minstrel's, and Commander's
---
That has never been the case in MMOs. Literally every end game reward has been time gated, ever since Everquest.
---
They don't want to play the game but they do want to earn gold. Getting less gold for doing nothing is still gold. It also destroy the prizes on the trading post on things that afk farms to much. So if he belive this peoplea are afk and not actively playing he is doing what he should and report them.
---
ESO looks like a wet turd, and the combat looks floatier than a rubber duck.
---
People been asking for it for years. No response from ANet.
---
Of course... You disagree so I am wrong and making things up. Bye Satan!
---
Heal tempest is probably the most chill easiest thing, since you can just camp water. But to be a good healer you'd still need good knowledge of encounters and very high situational awareness.
---
Now I'm going to say some things that contradict the other guy.
---
You can still gear druid/chrono for support if you want. Hybrid chrono with diviner's gear does good DPS and has portal+blink for skips, and druid is easy perma might + fury uptime with free spirits.
---
Condi scourge is also fine, tonnes of people run it.
---
CM groups will be a lot more discriminatory, but non-CM T4s honestly aren't hard enough for too many class distinctions to matter, as long as you have your necessary bases covered. I've been doing fractals for a long long time, and frankly it's generally more down to the quality of player. And I say this as someone who prefers 20-30 minute T4 clears (15 minutes total for all three if lucky and with good group). I've seen a loooooot of different groups and played over 10 different builds across all roles. I've done incredibly fast clears with power reapers and condi scourges in the mix. I've done incredibly slow clears with power weavers. If you think you can pull off top weaver deeps in the 99th percentile consistently, by all means. But T4 dailies are T4 dailies, and doing them daily sucks if you're not playing something you enjoy.
---
Bring performance, bring numbers, bring excellence, but unless you're doing CM clears with 200+ ess groups, don't feel you must play what DT has listed as the meta builds^1. They've got "great builds" and "good builds" also listed there for a reason.
---
1^The caveat to this is obviously read the LFG, and don't, for example, join on a condi dps if people want power meta specifically. In general T4 groups aren't this discriminating, in the interest of the group filling quickly and just getting on with it, because like I said T4s aren't really that difficult. CM groups however will discriminate more and therefore fill much slower.
---
&gt; I still think its Sky due to the Zephyrite aspects (wind, sun, and lightning) and Kralkatorrik's heavy use of those things (wind especially since Jahai)
---
Maybe really dumb and obvious but since the domains don't follow any strict pattern I know, maybe it was simply "Storm"? We don't ever see him using anything resembling the "Sun Aspect" but as you say lightning has been a key part of his characterisation from the start and as of PoF/LS4 we have seen a lot of specifically storm-like winds with very little more general air magic.
---
Alright, I'll agree to that.  But I still stand by my original argument that it's *possible* you get what you want right away(or never).  With the time gate, you are guaranteed to get it but have to wait.  Personally, I'd rather farm and hope for the drop.  I ran Stratholme hundreds of times before I got the steed.  Not many people had that mount because that's what it took to get it.  Man, I really miss that.  That whole era of MMO.
---
Where can I farm that shiny gold? Is there a specific way that don't require months to get all episodes?
---
Which is exactly why I did create this topic. While I did notice a few similar posts here and there over the years, there was nothing direct like this thread recently. So the more we ask about it, the more likely we are to get any response, even if it is just a simple "no".
---
*sigh* mate, I worked in QA for 5 years and I can tell you, that these threads and posts are **not** representative. the likelihood that someone posts about his dissatisfaction is far, far higher than it is for someone who likes it or doesnt care.
---
What do you mean not an artificial timegate? It's quite literally, factually, exactly that. We are in the middle of the journey and we are not having fun for a lot of reasons most of which aren't based on feelings and a lot of people don't care for the pixel animals further than "it's fun to use". 
---
Tbh seems you aren't really aware what timegating actually is what purpose it normally serves. Everybody is enjoying doing the collection and nobody is enjoying the timegate, save from you I guess. 
---
That's nice and I'm glad your having fun, but considering the majority isn't I'm gonna go ahead and say that anet should create content that satisfies the many rather than the few. No positive change for the game was ever made by people not complaining and just accepting it with logics like these. 
---
Cheers
---
Where/how did you get that helmet skin?
---
stop complaining
---
no it's not. since from previous post it seemed like you needed bitterfrost map too. which is why they hotfixed jormag today.
---
no question is a waste of time.
---
Why would anyone care about them? They propably make 80s per hour.
---
People rarely post about being happy. Or neutral. See I’m happy with the mount design and I don’t care about timegate, and I don’t go around starting threads about stating this
---
So why people make threads about them (not OP)? Why Anet sometimes punish them? If people didn't care it wouldn't be a problem :)
---
It's an useful resource but i still prefer the other thread started on release day that has images for each point and tells you advices about if it's up on a cliff or on the ground or up in a tree. Quite a bunch of the locations are tricky and a few of them are still trick even with those advices.
---
A TACO marker would be ideal but i'm not sure if someone with knowledge is going to bother to do one since each player only has to do it once.
---
In the "grand scheme of things" literally nothing this meaningless videogame does has any effect on players. In the world of GW2 entire map chats are full of people memeing on these time gates and bitching about it. It has an effect.
---
It's never been about having to have it day 1 (although it should be possible). It's about the game saying "nah, you aren't allowed to work on this anymore. Go sit until tommorow". Imagine if silverwastes had a cap that detected you'd made too much gold and said nah no more today. Likewise it punishes you for every reset you miss. Cant get on til saturday but you've got all afternoon free? Too bad, no catching up for you, should have had four 1 hour sessions during the week
---
Im bit miffed that I have to suffer several days of fuckin timegates that could be 22 days cuz sime jackwagon wanted you to use charged quartz
---
Still waiting for the item implementation of the "xp gain", "Continuum Split" and "Mirage Cloak" auras. Attending overpopulated zerg events on an underpowered PC to acquire them is not ideal.
---
So, you're saying all the displaced water might've caused a few Bubbles? :3
---
What is bothering me about this and always have is that people who are actually actively farming by moving around in the areas will often get their loot cut down or end up with no loot. And the afk-farmers move on to a new spot and that one get cut down and so on. 
---
Imo Arena Net should stop this afk farm nonsens i never saw another game accept it in the way Arena Net do. I mean the closest you come is BDO afk fishing but that is them placed on a spot with money involved to get better loot and not in the entire game were the game get cut down because of this players.
---
I meant the mini map. As in it's almost impossible to tell where things are from the mini map because they're just not good enough at showing the thousand little branches and levels in the map.
---
Large bumble bee
---
I'm out of the loop and only roughly kept up with the living story
---
Is that fucking Kralkatorriks corpse turned into a map? Because that's rad as shit
---
Anet sometimes punishes those who are truley afk and not respond to a pm or being positioned somewhere else. If you respond it's fine.
---
Get over yourself. I have never once told you how to play or told you not to do it. Just simply put my opinion that things like this ruin it for others. 
---
How if that telling you how to play?
---
Protip tho: You will have to play a proper build for end game stuff when your playing with others, otherwise you'll get ditched.
---
SO ... womp womp then? Or is it bohoo?.. do you have any other comments that you want to use to belittle people who DO see a problem? 
---
I worked in QA as well, For fucking IBM.. I did not ignore the problems that were brought up. and go "BoHoo" to people who did not like the operations of the server.  Just because you are perfectly happy does not give you the right to belittle others .. get it? 
---
No you don't .. like you say , You don't care.
---
Dude I just had a friend show me the way.
---
I also didn't get credit for the first Skale liver but was able to get another eventually.
---
So it has an effect then. Pick an argument
---
Then why make Eternity in the first place and not stop at Sunrise/Twilight?
---
Should we add that to the livestream flooded with WHY TIMEGATE, PLS REMOVE TIMEGATE, TIMEGATE SUX
---
I think the entire process has been fine, lazy people are just complaining 
---
The only criticism you can rightfully give is that the timegates are bullshit, which is completely blown out of proportion, people have just blindly joined the hate train
---
What time gate?
---
how about stop qqing?
---
and ofc you also worked for QA. sure, mate. ;)

Many trash mobs have complex/semi-random aggro factoring in proximity, damage taken from each source and sometimes their toughness as well. In my experience hanging back, not attacking but sending in melee/condi clones draws a lot of aggro but landing big hits will shift aggro onto you. Quite a few mobs also cling to one single target until it dies so summoning a clone before they react will work but the instant they lock onto you you need to force detarget or break combat. Stealth will rarely if ever work, first of all those skills have way too high cooldowns to be practical and secondly mobs tend to "cheat" and simply go after you once more right after stealth ends.
---
Since you're so good at reading, how did you not notice that I'm the same person...  
---
&gt;There are some parts of the map you can't explore with only the base game.  
---
Can mean that they can't explore expansion maps with only the base game.
---
&gt;, but that doesn't mean there isn't a whole lot to discover in the base game.  
---
Having a lot of stuff to discover doesn't prevent you from looking forward to something else, and the quote continues.
---
&gt;The thing I miss the most are the mounts from Path of Fire 
---
They would like PoF mounts, why can't they want PoF maps as well?  
---
I'm really confused, what are you even on about.
---
I'm guessing there is no straight list of materials you will need for this in total, time gating etc aside?
---
The mount has not been aquired by anyone in the playerbase yet and people felt that the Griffon was clunky in the beginning as well (granted they did make some improvements on it after release, but even this could happen again). But if you don't want to go for it...honestly that's fine. It is obviously designed to be somewhat unique but not a complete and utter gamechanger, so people can be excited to play with it while others… can just leave it be. I don't see the problem.
---
About your suggestion that the skyescale should have all the abilities of the griffon on top of what it has exclusively. That is a terrible idea. Not only would it make the Griffon pointless, it would also need to be much much more expensive given that the griffon costs 250g.
---
I never said there was no effect, you slobering moron. I said it had no effect on the playerbase, ie. the amount of active players. Pick up a brain.
---
Man the story the last few episodes has been a blast. The final fights have been really fun while feeling super intense and impactful, with some seriously gorgeous visuals all around (kralk's model is BEAUTIFUL!!!).
---
Thanks for the information. On a side note, going by your title, am I really in the minority for not having started the SkyScale process?
---
Silver Waste is a good start. Tekkits video will explain exactly how to do it. https://youtu.be/8Bk5mmuqVK0
---
In PoF there is the Istan map from Season 4 chapter 1. The palawadan event is good for gold. 
---
Other things to do if you are tired of one of them is for example gathering nodes. This can easy give you 20-40 gold a day if you follow the gathering guides. And at releases of something new that require a lot of materials the prices on the trading post goes up.
---
Hot maps can give you Freshwater pearls if lucky (and with buffs) https://youtu.be/VEDvLDu3G4o shows you the route. I belive there are several of the season maps in that route but if you do not have them just skip to what you have.
---
The season maps usually have a lot of node farms. Some are better then others and some have more of a specific typ of nodes so keep that in mind if you decide to buy some of the chapters.
---
Farming meta map events like the HoT events in Tangles Depths, Auric Basin and Dragon stand is also a thing. Tons of guides on youtube.
---
Boss trains in core Tyria, not that profitable but you get the extra rare chest from each boss every day. Tequatl also give you 2 gold and 15 k karma.  
---
PoF maps have bounty train. Again not the most gold but as i said sometimes you want to change the view.
---
And then we have the dailys. They are on your top right screen when you log in. Do 3 of those and you get 2 gold. There are often easy ones to make that takes you maybe 10 min so that is free 60 gold a month.
---
Flipping the trading post. If this is your thing then that is possible to do in GW2. I would read up on this because it can go terribly wrong if you are just flipping what ever so make sure to be aware before you starts.
---
Also note that farming events usually do not give gold it self, it is the crafting materials and other things you get out of it that will be the goldbringer.
---
I will!
---
So I decided to see how it would stack up.
---
Depends on how deep Orr was, and how slowly it rose. If it was shallow, then it could be mistaken for a tide coming in at a weird time. The height of the arm of abaddon leads me to believe it was rather deep. Then again, I don't know if the in game map is much to go by, since for the longest time I had the impression that Orr rose relatively recently. Everything is still dripping wet, yanno? Anyway, if it rose slowly, the wave would be small but it would be propagated for longer - so I'd think it would look like sea level rise in the area around Orr, all the way until Orr finally surfaced, after which it would normalize at a higher level because of the water Orr itself is displacing. I think. I aint no hydrologist or whatever the hell sort of person studies that kinda thing. But - there's no doubting it would be bad. Looking at the numbers from the [2004 Indian Ocean earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_and_tsunami), an area that's presumably smaller than Orr rose about 15 meters in several minutes, and that produced 30 meter waves.
---
*With that said*... you'd be [surprised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1958_Lituya_Bay,_Alaska_earthquake_and_megatsunami) what dropping a few rocks (by which I mean thousands to millions of cubic kilometers of rock) can accomplish. [Megatsunamis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megatsunami) are orders of magnitude larger than normal tsunamis, and they are caused *exclusively* by dropping stuff in, rather than raising stuff up. However, unless we're taking about a large meteor strike where there's just an *enormous* amount of energy at play, these don't have much in the way of staying power. They fall apart if they stay over deep water for long.
---
All the reading has left me curious. I wonder what it would look like if a small island's worth of rock (which is to say, a very large mountain) was dropped into blue water from a few hundred meters up. My gut tells me that something with that mass at that height is verging on large meteor levels of energy, but I could totally be wrong. Any counsel from people who know their shit would be appreciated.
---
Honestly, I love sparkly things so yes pls, give me this as an infusion

**2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami**
---
The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake occurred at 00:58:53 UTC on 26 December, with an epicentre off the west coast of northern Sumatra. It was an undersea megathrust earthquake that registered a magnitude of 9.1–9.3 Mw, reaching a Mercalli intensity up to IX in certain areas. The earthquake was caused by a rupture along the fault between the Burma Plate and the Indian Plate.
---
A series of large tsunamis up to 30 metres (100 ft) high were created by the underwater seismic activity that became known collectively as the Boxing Day tsunamis.
---

---
**1958 Lituya Bay, Alaska earthquake and megatsunami**
---
The 1958 Lituya Bay earthquake occurred at July 9 at 22:15:58 with a moment magnitude of 7.8 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of XI (Extreme). The strike-slip earthquake took place on the Fairweather Fault and triggered a rockslide of 40 million cubic yards (30 million cubic meters and about 90 million tons) into the narrow inlet of Lituya Bay, Alaska. The impact was heard 50 miles (80 km) away, and the sudden displacement of water resulted in a megatsunami that washed out trees to a maximum elevation of 1,720 feet (520 m) at the entrance of Gilbert Inlet. This is the largest and most significant megatsunami in modern times; it forced a re-evaluation of large-wave events and the recognition of impact events, rockfalls, and landslides as causes of very large waves.
---
**Megatsunami**
---
A megatsunami is a very large wave created by a large, sudden displacement of material into a body of water.
---
Megatsunamis have quite different features from other, more usual types of tsunamis. Most tsunamis are caused by underwater tectonic activity (movement of the earth's plates) and therefore occur along plate boundaries and as a result of earthquake and rise or fall in the sea floor, causing water to be displaced. Ordinary tsunamis have shallow waves out at sea, and the water piles up to a wave height of up to about 10 metres (33 feet) as the sea floor becomes shallow near land.

Well you're in luck! There's a post about the scion weapon skins. We can expect rng and low drop chances for those!  
---
I get where you're coming from. A decade ago I also enjoyed farming for those ridiculously low drop chance items. Now that I've grown up, I just don't want to do it anymore. I'd grind my ass off for those scion weapon skins a decade ago or heck even 2-3 years ago but I'm not even going to bother with pure low chance rng things now.  
---
I think GW2 raids have a good system that fit me. You have a low chance to get an item or skin but you can also save up currency you get over time and guarantee that you get the item. For example, I've gotten 3 xera portal drops and there are people who have gotten none but they can at least buy it. I think this system works well for raids because raids are supposed to have replayability so having a timegate there is kinda whatever but you can also get the stuff you want eventually with the tokens. I remember in 2016 when everyone in my static very quickly got the matthias staff to drop except me but it's okay because by that point I could just buy it!
---
A mirage charr... The madlad!

Haven't played in a while, are you still locked out of spirit shards in HoT if you haven't defeated a raid boss?
---
Timelocked ones naturally.
---
I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT BUBBLES POSSIBLY WAKING UP
---
yikes
---
There is no reason for you to not get those mounts though. The basic mounts are something you just get on the map by doing the required heart and some gold cost. The griffon and the others after that will require collections and such but the basic one you get very easy.
---
this is reddit, not your twitter account
---
Thank you for your comment. Just ignited my interest in getting HoT…
---
I’ll try looking into it today, I joined someone but they were saved to the final fight so it didn’t count for me.

Gonna see if I can hunt down someone on the first part.
---
Haven't plays since Vanilla, loved the game but never got into raiding so fell off.
---
New expansion looks great, how hard would it be to adjust if i jumped back in?
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
Map chat on the topic is getting more than a bit rude.
---
I'm happily using the block function on those people.
---
Thank you for your input.
---
Because in the end most of us that want to own it will get it.
---
Mhm, fair point.
---
Hey, those are expensive feet, buddy. It takes a lot of money to look this broke.
---
Fair point. It will not be the last mount too, probably.
---
I mean, I guess
---
what makes you think Roxx is a wolf?, lmao.
---
Fair points.
---
Though about your Silverwastes comparison - isn't it what they did with Istan? I'm kinda out of loon on this topic, but I heard Istna is no longer viable farm for more than one circle of events a day.
---
Yeahh the GS is subjective. What's unique about it is the animations as you said. I love the Hundred blades animation especially.
---
The chests on the new map can contain Aurene's container which gives you the option to choose an ascended weapon with Scion skins. It's the base ascended weapon skin but light blue and sparkle effects. Basically like the Sunless weapons but positive \^\^
---
I would replace "life magic" with "soul energy" as Joko was shown absorbing a nearby Awakened to restore himself more quickly and Dhuum, notorious for being "unkillable", also consumed souls for power. Plus the Commander went after a soul-consuming monster rather than, say, a legendary GW1 healer in order to revive.
---
Of course there are plenty of other potential excuses for immortality but the fact it transferred from Joko to Aurene at least implies it can be imprinted onto the magic itself as opposed to being a spell or a complex physical mechanism.
---
The new meta has what I consider a great approach with the keys to the mistborn coffers.  It rewards those who help push the meta forward in the camp building phase and isn't just a "show up at XX:30 to do just the final part while getting all of the loot.".  I personally like that it is not on a timer.
---
The keys and champ farm portion also let you spread out your playtime and it makes the map accessible in smaller playtime chunks.  That is, during the week you can play here or there for a short time and still build up keys and then on the weekend if you have more time you can burn a whole bunch of keys in one meta run.  
---
Finally, the fight phase of the final meta seems to make different roles a bit more relevant in open world play.  I feel like the non-destroyable crystal "towers" that shoot are designed to encourage (but not explicitly require) a healer.  The pylon clearing is fun for a non-combat change of pace.
---
I am a bit tired of the "kill all N bosses at the same time" design, but I guess that's life.  Not enough to ruin it for me.
---
What was all that? I don't even know what your point was there.
---
There are two living story parts that I haven't done. Thats it. I've done all of HoT, PoF. I played during Season 1. I've finished season 2, 3, and am working on 4. I just finished the newest episode.
---
Yeah, I haven't done it completely. But I sure as hell have played most of it. I have over 1.5k hour in the game. I read the dialog.
---
Obviously Logan is going to be more fleshed out, he's been around longer.
---
So again, whats the point of what you just said? That we can't point out that the only reason you don't like her is because her character is a lesbian? That really seem like the only issue you have with her. Her story in game is generally the same as Logans. I've pointed it out elsewhere in here.
---
&gt;Let me guess ? All the people involved in the wiki are homophobic ? Theses two reddit guys bellow my first comment talking about Logan/Marjory development are homophobic ? Or maybe Logan is in fact way more developed cause Anet decided to ? Wich make them homophobic ? Arguing is homophobic ? You're a racist don't forget that !
---
What is all this? Are you trying to imply that anyone who even talks about Logan or Marjory, we call homophobic? Because that's not even what happened. Someone who complains about her being a lesbian though? Probably.
---
You basically said that she's just a token lesbian character. What makes her that? Just because she's a lesbian character? Because she displays that she's a lesbian character? Do you say that about any lesbian character in any game? How is her showing affection any different than any other straight character showing affection? Is it because you just deem it to be political? Thats a you problem. Fix yourself.
---
Much of the advice being given is more relevant for someone in 100-200 essence groups than it is someone starting out in T4.  
---
Beginner T4 groups do not always cover quickness, alacrity or fury.  Whether we're talking pReaper, pQuickbrand or pRenegade you'll need "abnormal" amounts of boon-duration to support average because the phases won't be nearly as fast.  You might have a Druid healer one day, a heal Renegade/Firebrand the next, and a Scourge, Tempest or Scrapper on the weekend.  It varies. 
---
What Chrono/Druid offers is a combination of stability and flexibility.  This idea that beginner T4 players are going to break into the T4 meta with a speed-clear support setup is optimistic at best and irresponsible at worst.  Players that are new to T4 won't have their dodges down perfectly -- they'll need extra healing and damage mitigation. 
---
Firebrand &amp; Renegade are designed around the assumption that experienced T4 players can survive with minimal healing.  The reality is that most T4 players can't actually survive without some sort of dedicated healer.  Firebrigade falls apart at its seams when you're not playing in 100-200 essence groups because you can't force fast phases without crisp breaks and powerful burst.  
---
The speed-clear meta is discussed, but outside of CMs T4's are the badlands  People things ranging from Power Reaper to Condi-Reaper, Scourge, Firebrand, Herald, Tempest, Holosmith, Daredevil, Deadeye -- classes that don't benefit nearly to the same degree from Scorchrazor's Summit's lack of an ICD; whereas the meta DH, Weaver &amp; Soulbeast synergize with One Wolf Pack and can heal to full in a fraction of a second when casting abilities like Procession of Blades, Glyph of Storms or Whirling Defense. 
---
The main issue that I've noticed with lower-tier, less experienced Firebrigade groups is that their breaks are *terrible.*  If you want to play Firebrand-Renegade then you have a responsibility to keep break-bars broken whenever possible.  This means using mistlock singularities to pre-stack boons and using consumable crowd-control items like Metal Rods, Shovels &amp; Planks.  It's true that Chrono/Druid offer less DPS than Firebrand-Renegade. However, they do make up for that in being better at longer -- pug phases. 
---
I'm not impressed with groups that try to apply organized strategies to lower skill-tiered players.  Chrono/Druid sacrifices DPS in favor of slightly longer phases, more consistent breaks, and powerful mobility skips with blink, portal &amp; mass invisibility. The entire point of Firebrigade is to push fast phases and you can't count on regular T4 players to do 20-30k+ burst DPS.  
---
When things get messy with the "meta" Firebrand + Renegade composition running Diviner's they get *really* messy.  You can't always count on benevolent or favorable instabilities and I've watched things like We Bleed Fire, Adrenaline Rush or Outflanked utterly destroy "meta" compositions.  The speed-clear meta and the pug-meta are entirely different things. 
---
There are good, sensible reasons why many CM pugs want Heal Firebrands.  It's because it has great quality of life and access to boons like stability, resistance, is flexible utility-wise and generates more aegis than it knows what to do with.  While I'm talking about Firebrand I should also mention that most inexperienced Power Quickbrands that I've run into do about 6-8k DPS.  If you're going to do Chrono DPS on something that's basically a "DH Lite," then you should just play Chrono, frankly.  
---
pFB should be bursting for 15-20k+ and I think it's near essential for it to do so if you want to get away with minimal healing on boss Fractals like in 99, 99cm or 100/100cm.  The point of FB-Ren is to pulverize Fractal bosses with 4.5 DPS classes, and in normal T4's you're lucky if you get 2 competent players.  For example's sake...
---
I did Thaumanova Reactor yesterday on my Chrono.  1 DH burst for 20k.  1 Thief for 10k, 1 Warrior for 10k.  The only reason we were able to break/burn Subject 6 was because I pulled out a metal rod and broke the break-bar a second time.  So, what am I getting at? 
---
Firebrand &amp; Renegade is great when you have the security of having experienced DPS players.  CMs confer that security.  Regular T4's do not, and you should absolutely run some sort of healer when dealing with T4 pugs.  Whether that's Renegade, Firebrand or Druid; it really doesn't matter.  **The standard for starting out in T4 should be clearing fractals &amp; learning mechanics not trying to delete mechanics with unprepared players with low DPS or unoptimized, non-meta builds.**
---
There is a cool reddit function too. Guess what it is?
---
I've not raided gw2 yet.  You make a good argument.  I sure really five raiding a look.
---
What bothers me is that like engineer turrets this is very easy to fix. Just remove the autocast from gs 4, and set a life limit of 1 hour to the minions
---
I would bet that the majority of players haven't made it far through these timegates. Playing as much as I possibly can, I haven't made it past buying the medicine ingredients. If they remove these gates by Monday, I might never hit a timegate (I have charged crystals to spare).
---
Best part is getting rich on lamps and food $$$
---
ok lol, edited
---
jeez you're fragile
---
they changed certain events to only give their bonus end chests once a day. they went a little overboard with istan but their changes don't stop you from going there and farming it if you want to, you just don't get as much loot on successive loops. in this context when we're talking about timegates it's strictly "you can't progress this any more, at all, until reset" like wayfarer's henge and this. daily-limited bonus loot is generally fine because you can still get the normal rewards from doing the meta/whatever, you just don't get that extra amalgamated gemstone or etc each time.
---
Yes.
---
Judging by the claws and tail, imma say Asura for the race.
---
Depends on if they had a use for them.  When I was working on my last goal crafting a bunch of legendaries, I regularly had &lt;200 spirit shards until I finished all of the Shards of Bloodstone that I needed.
---
Must admit, I've been selling the lamps. I've got that node in my home and it suddenly became a nice profit.
---
Oh yeah I totally forgot about hundred blades! That one is really cool too!
---
I also really like the scion skins but I'm not a fan of rng only things so I will likely never even try to get them unless the drop chances are actually decent. I've only done the meta twice myself and will do it a few more times for some achievements and will then likely move on.
---
There was a patch 13 hours ago, you can see the post on the front page:
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/920912/#Comment_920912
---
Gonna assume since they haven't said anything new on it yet... Still disabled
---
What led you to think they were disabled?
---
I'm sitting on 450 without trying right now, after buying the new home node, and probably another 1000 in raw materials in my bank if I dumped them all because I hardly ever craft _cause I hate crafting slightly less than being on fire._
---
The grow lamp is 50g... I'd probably end up spending the same amount of time getting that gold as I would charging crystals. Or could just sell all my mats again like I did for gryphon, not like I craft a whole lot anymore anyways. Between timegating ascended and the absurd flax-oil costs (per recipe, not on the TP)
---
Uh they anet tweeted it
---
Not wrong, but I don't think what he was asking...
---
Well statistics is questionable always. No mater what your sample size you always can push towards certain agenda. But nevertheless GW2eff is quite good at tracking actual active playerbase. And yep, time would tell, but I highly doubt that it would in line with roller beetle at 37% unlock witch would be huge fail for Anet as company that need to sell dragon skins.
---
Afaik, yes.
---
If you're at it, can you block me too? At least you'll spare me the horror of looking at your posts.
---
Oh sweet thanks, my mesmers lvl 80 so I’m good to go
---
Tbh I haven't even reinstalled GW2 for this update even though I was pretty hyped for skyscale purely based on the fact that the time gate for a mount turns me off.
---
I dont think med have the same issue. Probably minor oversight.
---
i wonder if this is related to the exosuit griffon always having an underlying reddish tint to the wings on medium shaders
---
probably not but i can always dream they'll actually fix it
---
Solid enough for basically everywhere. Not best in slot for when big burst is preferred thought.
---
Block me too! *raises arm impatiently*
---
For what content?
---
Is that how things work wherever you work? Nobody meets to discuss the ramifications of a change, and managers just unilaterally make mandates on what will happen with no discussion whatsoever?
---
Every time I've seen that happen, the people making the decision missed something and then stuff breaks or security is diminished or the task is harder than it should be and other things get delayed.
---
While "just git er don" is a nice idea, policies should prevent that, and you should not make exceptions.
---
anet tweeted it out a few days ago. people were using the new unlimited TP to friend to take level 2s to bloodstone fen and map complete it (takes &lt;5 min with a griffon) over and over so they suspended the key/transmute rewards for all map completes
---
People are selling/[buying](https://www.reddit.com/r/GW2Exchange/comments/bm9yeu/wtb_gift_of_masteries_and_accbound/) them
---
Wait, which event do you have to fail to complete an achievement?!
---
I'm pointing out your false assemptions about Logan and Marjory with evidence.
---
Other than that I already answered to your only demagogic point 3 times, read my comments back, I'm not gonna write it again.
---
You're playing the homophobic card again and again ( against someone who fight for integrity wich is funny ).
---
At least the other guy in his demagogic poetry and complacency about intelligence, art and storytelling in videogame ( compared to movies which is funny too ) pointed out the real problem :
---
" How is the character ''caricatural' in any way? Does she talk about wanting to bang women 99% of her screen-time? "
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Marjory_Delaqua/dialogue 
---
Wich I'm responding yes with evidence, since 4 people who confirmed it in your own thread was not enough.
---
The discussion ends here.
---
It was the second legendary i made, but i fell outa love with it. H.O.P.E is better imo
---
This is not support case, this is making dev team aware of the issue. Same things happens on forums. It doesn't qualify for penalisation, sorry pal :)
---
There'd be a learning curve for sure, quite a lot has changed. There's lots of content to catch up on, but nothing too daunting. It really depends on how much time you can put towards GW2. A friend of mine started this game fresh in January and he's done all personal story, expansions, and already doing all end game content.
---
&gt;oh boy you havent played ff14 at all
---
I have more time in FFXIV than GW2 or WoW. Roughly, my experience in all 3 games is:
---
GW2 - played GW1 on release, and each campaign/expansion on release. Followed news closely of GW2, signed up for beta/stress tests, played early access and been on and off playing since.
---
WoW - got in during BC, friend quit shortly after I got max level, I got bored, quit. Returned in Cata and played some on my own, quit when MoP was announced. Returned half way through WoD, played through to legion and quit part way through. Returned at end of legion to BFA, quit in Oct, returned in Feb.
---
FFXIV - played a few months after release for a month or two. I quit for about a year and then returned and played non-stop (with 1 or 2 months unsubbed total) between the release of 2.4 and 4.45, or about 4 years). 
---
Last time I checked, I had I think 60 days in GW2, 120 in WoW, 180 in FFXIV - however, I have put in more hours in both GW2 and WoW since then.
---
I wasn't referring to the story when I was talking about barriers to entry. I more meant complexity and accessibility of systems.
---
Sounds about right, I have similar results with similar specs, the only difference I have is that I have character model detail at highest, and change it only when in WvW to lowest.
---
I also use standard enemy models (but not standard allied models because I recognize my party's Firebrand by his bad fashion xD)
---
Mood
---
So do they actually play the game?
---
I mean..."Im busy with kids through the week and I don't play on weekends" just sounds like "I never play so I don't want you to play either or else I'll feel like I'm missing out".
---
If I were you I'd just do it. You can always help them when they get back to the game.
---
I'm needing a lot of Hero Points to catch up with Elite Specs I didn't train during HoT, but it seems that HoT hero points trains are mostly dead atm.   
---
Is there any way to efficiently train them, or am I SOL?
---
I felt an outside perspective could lend an impartial opinion.
---
You not that when a GM whispers you and you are not there to answer him you will be banned?
---
Thanks for everyone WHO replied! I ended up buying 2000 gem code from somewhere cheap :) Now I have Season 3 and Season 4 and there is still 400 gem left. I dont want to start living World without having all the seasons (only season 2 left).   
---
So I have season 3 and 4. And need 800 gem which is almost 280 gold. So what is the best place to farm 280 gold without spoiling the story? :)
---
I don't worry about it. It's only ever 5 - 10 minutes max.
---
Thank you for detailed explanation Lovaa! It's amazing to see that community is really that helpful!
---
Really great work! Wish I'd had this when I was doing it yesterday. I'm sure tons of people will benefit greatly from this.
---
Best way of getting bloodstone is open champ bags on a lvl 80 char.
---
&gt; so why not get some extra incentive to log in every day?
---
I logged in today for 5 seconds to feed the baby. Such wow.
---
I think so. But don't worry, there are time gates. Heavy ones if you don't have charged quartz. Even if you're waiting to start the collection, you'll need over 20 charged quartz iirc to get the skyscale. So start charging them now!
---
I wouldnt min this infusion as its not over the top at all. fuck do I hate the infusion aura monsters that this game has produced.
---
I honestly hope they ship some fix for the timegate issue (they already fixed the XP issue so they may be working on it still) today before the Guild Chat so that they can actually get some good PR out of it, and show that they are listening, even if they can't talk back yet because they are not sure on delivery.
---
Linking wiki pages with no explanation isn't proof. You think because she mentions the relationship, she's a token character. Thats embarrassing for you honestly.
---
That's a backtick
---
The story will help you unlock the Springer, Skimmer and Jackal, the Griffon is a collection+goldsink after PoF is finished. while the Rollerbeetle is part of LS4E4 (Domain of Kourna)
---
Most of the RNG mount licenses only include the first 5 mounts, you can preview which ones they include.
---
If you're looking for _one particular_ skin then I'd buy the choice license.
---
I used two RNG licenses and got two skins I don't hate from it. A skimmer and a raptor.
---
I've since bought only choice &amp; fancy skins, to have a unique look for each character.
---
it's too bad that this fantastic LS episode is being drowned out by all the crying about the timegate(s) on the skyscale. really enjoy this maps meta.
---
If you identify them first you have a chance of discovering better gear, and skins you may not have.
---
How do you know it's for the last collection? Maybe it's something like the griffon race adventures? But didn't they say they added routes for skyscales in a multitude of maps, I think these are for when you actually get the skyscale.
---
Depends on what server you are on. There should still be HP trains on weekends regardless, but there's this guy called Osano on NA servers that runs like 4 hours of HP train per day every Fri Sat Sun. Check LFG.
---
Indeed. There are 2 or 3 regions in Assassin's Creed Origins that are literally empty deserts with absolutely nothing in them. Gorgeous but empty. All you can do is run/ride through them. PoF does at least have NPCs that you can interact with or listen to. Or random treasures you can pick up once a day in obscure/empty corners.
---
You just explained all my thoughts! It's getting ridiculous. Anet gave as an amazing story, an amazing map, the best meta (in my opinion) in a long time all for FREE, and people are getting mad for having to spend a few days doing some collections? It's your choice, you don't have to do them.
---
Sometimes...it's better to quit while you're ahead...
---
I don't have a lot of time, few hours a night. I just loved exploring the world so much in the base game, the idea of coming back and seeing new areas and especially mounts seems awesome!
---
I think it's 12
---
Was there ever one ?
---
You can actually destroy the crystal turrets by throwing the embers at them. It’s part of one of the Crystal Bloom upgrade events.
---
Anything that drops gear of that level can drop a precursor
---
I am quite impressed by this. Fantastic job.
---
This was a lifesaver the day I started the collections!
---
They’ve done it before.
---
This is exactly how I felt about the episode in general. Was expecting at least three book collections, one for each realm, but nothing. They had the chance to expand upon Balthazar's motivations, to have something akin to Desmina's diary at the Underworld island, and basically anything regarding Melandru and druids lore would have been a godsend. But instead they chose to bloat the place with skyscales. This is a serious problem with one of the writing teams and I keep forgetting which one: they come up with things they believe to be so much better than previous lore that they won't even have to refer to it, but that's not how buildup works at all - the skyscales could easily have been related to these specific mist realms too - it was just laziness and too much time spent on this meta-fluff.
---
I just did that and purchased season 3 and 4! But I don't want to start them without playing season 2 because now I want to experience everything. I will keep playing normally until I finish my story. I hope I will be already saved some Money. If it is enough, i will convert them into gems and purchase season 2 and start my end game journey!  
---
Thank you BTW!
---
How much more time?
---
"There is an Asura, so it's all fine."
---
I agree with several people here in that I think the wait should have been telegraphed. It should have been sold with labeling on the package "Raise your own Skyscale!" As one person aptly put, expectation management is everything, and most people (including myself) were initially upset because we were hyped for the mount and then slammed into the time-gate wall.
---
In actuality, if you can only play an hour or two every week/few days, I'm afraid that kinda negates any argument you have against time-gating because the chances are you wouldn't be able to complete a collection in time for the daily reset time gate to even make a difference. You might get through half of one of the collections, maybe two. It took me 3 hours with a guide. So while I sympathize with you on that 'last day' where you complete the collection after having your time split up by RL, the daily reset timegate ultimately won't have that much of an impact on you.
---
But I still think the mount should be better for all the effort you need to put into it. There's rumors that we're going to get another living story season. If that's the case, it wouldn't surprise me if it included new masteries for the Skyscale mount, to sort of simulate it 'growing up' and getting stronger. At least, I hope they do, because as is, I think the mount is a little under-powered. The griffon's talent is its ability to fly fast and do acrobatics, but the Skyscale's 'stamina' bar feels too flimsy to really make it 'equal' to the griffon in its own unique way. If the stamina lasted 20-30% longer, or there were a mastery to increase it, I'd say yea, that's a great mount.
---
But in closing yes, Anet's big mistake was making it sound like you were going to just hop away with your own dragon right away. I'm going to go toss balls for my Nightfur-*cough*... Skyscale for catharsis.
---
Does it match your outfit at all?
---
Do you still have the individual maps? And would you be willing for the wiki to have them? We've been getting far more traffic for this ls since dulfy is taking a break and while there are more people trying to help, they aren't as high quality as this.
---
I see you've got some serious cynical skill level, though it's not really us to judge on topics like these. We've never run a company ourselves, have we?   
---
Also this is 2019, everyone can share their opinions. That's basically the whole point why I wanted to make a post like this, to just take a step back and think about what we're doing right now.
---
Can I get three tropies for day?
---
I killed Karka, Sand Lion and Iboga. I obtained a trophy from each one of them. I continued my hunt killing Jacaranda and Insect, but I havn't got nothing.
---
Players will never be 100% happy.
---
&gt;removing that time gate would be unfair to those players who've reached that stage already
---
this is a really bad precedent that they've fallen back on a few times now, and it really needs to go away. yes, it's unfair. but the idea that "well, some people wasted some time/money they didn't need to because of our poor design, therefor we *can never fix it* since that would be unfair to those poeple. i guess we'll just make everyone waste their time / money on this thing in perpetuity" is worse. it's "unfair" to the people who had a dominator shield that was worth 230g a few days ago that it's now worth 30, but that doesn't stop them from reintroducing the skin.
---
rip the bandaid off asap, sorry to the people who already had to deal with some of it, but it's for the greater good going forward.
---
Yeah, I have Kul Tirans anwyay. I don't play Horde atm (not enjoying their story). Also Dark Iron Dwarves, nightborne and highmountain tauren. I didn't really want any of these though, I just have them because I had the rep and may as well do the 5 minute quest for it.
---
I don't think they should have gone this route they should have disabled teleport to friends to living world maps till a player was level 80.
---
Are you attempting these achievements on a character that has already played through those stories once?
---
The "complete the map meta 25 times" achievement can't be soloed.  But the map's meta is very rewarding, so people will still be doing it in the future.
---
exaggerate much?
---
- the timegates of the skyscale are particularly bad, because they are hard full-stops. in many other cases collections/progress do not consist of 75+% timegates *and* allow you to make progress on other parts of the process while you wait, or the timegates consist of "only" an event cycle.
---
- only very few people demand or expect the best g/h from new metas. however many of the LW metas are so mistuned, that the payoff is even worse than e.g. cor world boss trains, and the biggest incentive to complete them a couple of times is locked achievement progress *(points at THP)*. once those one-time achievements are completed, these kind of metas simply cannot compete with their counterparts anymore, and tend to not even be worth shoving into some personal schedule/rotation.
---
- not everyone always looks at dulfy or other guides. tasks are surprisingly intuitive these days for the most part.
---
Good deal. Obviously you know them better than some rando from Reddit. 
---
I guess I'm just coming from the perspective of a single (well...unmarried) person with no kids, living alone...but most of my friends are married and many have kids.
---
While I don't game online with any of them, there's plenty of other activities that I used to do with those friends that, over time, it basically has become "do it yourself or you're never going to get around to it".
---
Don’t remove the time gate entirely, but maybe have the time decrease for every x events that you participate in around the world. Just a thought.
---
That timegate mimimi is soooo.... wrong.  
---
Sry guys, but i think timegate is ok. Yes, i would be happy if im finishd the collecion already but whats next? When im done, i dont have to do anymore... so.... its ok
---
And did it hurt you so much that you're mad at Anet for it?
---
I mean,look at that tiny baby! :D
---
You’ll need to visit all LS4 maps at part 5 so no.
---
Side I’ve had my griffon for a few days and I’ve had no difficulty getting around the new map between using my griffin and borrowing Skyscales, I haven’t been in any real rush to unlock it. I personally don’t really see the problem with the timegate. Just do what you can and you’ll unlock it in literally 3 or so days. It took me that long to even save the gold for the griffon collections anyway, like I just really don’t get what all the fuss is about. It seems like the people complaining are also the same people who just dump money into the game to buy gems so that they don’t have to grind gold out, and wanted to grind out the whole collection in a single day so they’d have the mount on the same day as release.
---
It's almost as if there are people with different opinions and likings on the internet.
---
The key is to build it in such a way that respects the player's time and allows them to set the pacing of progresssion.
---
Example 1: Fractal God.
---
A pretty large undertaking that is effectively time gated.  However the fractals are widely regarded as fun and engaging content.   You could do just the dailies or you could farm 42 over and over to advance a bit quicker.
---
Example 2:  legendary armor
---
In particular the chak eggs.  You can run this daily when you have time, and farm the caches for a chance to advance a bit faster.
---
Example 3: wvw pips.
---
You get to play wvw on your terms and make meaningful progression even though the rewards are effectively timegated by the number of tickets you can get per week.
---
Converse that with the skyscale.  You must absolutely reach a threshold before daily reset.  If you miss it by 10 minutes, you must wait 24 hours.  However players that like to play fast or more often are only allowed to make minuscule progression per day.   Theres a giant neon sign basically saying,  YOU HAVE PLAYED ENOUGH OF THIS CONTENT TODAY.  GO DO SOMETHING ELSE.
---
No I'm not exaggerating. Name 1 time gate that was added into the game where the community as a whole didn't complain. 
---
I am not saying love the skyscale issue, far from it. What I am asking for is ideas that meet all the above requirements.
---
The thing is, this scare is pretty healthy one. It is tempting to save some money by getting gems cheaper, but one really needs to check the source, if the seller is not approved, and he got it by some fraud, it is mainly you who get hit and lose precious stuff...well, nto only you, but also the person who got frauded. 
---
So...it always is good to repeat "Better safe than sorry"
---
Ahh ok, understood. I did that after the LS had already moved past it so it wasn't a big deal for me.
---
Mawdrew
---
Can confirm. I don't even have be POF and I have a friggin griffon skin
---
- I Summon you, Minion, Rise!
---
- I didn't think it would pop like that.
---
Really many of the [necromancer summoning voice lines](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Minion#Trivia) could work.
---
The initial comment you responded to claimed that MMOs are all about using players to incentivize other players to complete content so they too can show off their cool shit. How am I coming out of left field? 
---
I never said dressing up your dolly was exclusive to MMOs; I'm saying that in MMOs people get to dress up their dollies where everyone can see them and that absolutely works to motivate some people to seek out those prestigious items.
---
With literally two exceptions, I really love this episode, and it felt like a fantastic season finale.
---
- Aside from one thing, I thought the story was great, I like the note it ended on, and it had so many cool visuals and concepts going on. I can't wait to see where they're going to take us next season. Minor spoiler: I was in awe when I finally saw Kralk's full body model- he's so HUGE and kinda weird and I love it.
---
- The new map took some getting used to, and I haven't done the meta a whole lot yet, but it's giving me some serious "Dragons Stand, but more accessible" vibes. DS is still my favorite meta, so having a version of it that's a little easier to jump into is awesome for me. It seems like the rewards are pretty good too? But I haven't played it enough to know.
---
- The new armor is cool and surprisingly easy to get! I really like how a few pieces are connected to achievements you need for the Skyscale collection, so you can easily work on both at once.
---
- I love how the Skyscales handle even without masteries- they let me chill and take things at a slower pace than the bunny or griffon do so I feel like I can enjoy the maps even more. Did I miss the cliff I was going for? No worries, just hover to the side a bit for a better angle. Do I need to check the map while a mob is trying to kill me? Just fly up and hang out in midair. Did I suddenly change which direction I want to go? Skyscale can turn on a dime without losing altitude. I really think it's going to be my favorite mount once I get it and finish the masteries. Even the collection is cool too- I like how it tells a story about you getting the mount, and I don't mind some of the time gating. 
---
- The HoT masteries are useful again! Even if I don't use them much because of mounts, I'm just glad to see I CAN use them outside of HoT/LS3 maps. They feel actually useful now, and not just like a gimmick thrown at us that's only helpful on like two maps. I hope they get worked into core maps as well for the same reasons.
---
- Similarly, I like how we need to go to older maps for the collections, as a way to keep other content relevant and give it some love. It's a good reminder that yes, the rest of Tyria still exists and had some pretty great stuff in it, even if most of the players seem to be farming just a couple places.
---
This reminds me of the old mission maps on the GW1 wiki! Super cool, super helpful! Thanks dude!!
---
HoT did it after much complaining by the community (and not unjustified). HoT metas also have a lot of achievements, collections and legendary weapon crafting requirements.
---
Maybe that is what ANet can start adding more into. different reasons and different goals to be doing content.
---
Which is funny, since the male heavy Aetherblad gloves have a part that can't be dyed, but can be dyed on the female version. It's been like that since the set came out in like 2013/14. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Yes, is that the issue? Is it like that for all LW story achievements? Strange that it would let you play any chapter of the story with a character that hasn't completed any of it, and then not allow that character to obtain the achievements.
---
We have several retailers in South America... Are we speaking of a specific region that isn't covered? South America is pretty huge, after all. 
---
I'll be happy to bring up coverage issues with your team here, if you want to give me more details!
---
But especially Nuuvem is a partner for us: https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers/#Brazil-physical
---
I usually see Aurene pop up for underworld meta. I got the achievement about 5mins into exploring Dragonfall after landing there. Just hang around the charr event where they leave camp to fix things-idr the event name or putpose- and she should pop up.
---
Magic find does not affect opening unidentified gear anymore.
---
Considering the high reward yield, I doubt the map is going to be left desolate any time soon, people will be there to level up their masteries, they’ll be there to farm sellable mats. At least until we get even more content anyway.
---
Bringing back monthly achievements would be great as is the new game events. Maybe Anet just doesn't try to make every episode perfect. But with how many zones we do have, if they give a weekly event that is based in a zone, people go back to something they haven't done in a year+ and its at least a change of pace to what they normally do so its a little fresher.
---
I only wish we were given a name for Melandru's domain.
---
Even though pressing f 50 times around the map barley qualifies as content (at least using mounts to get to them is fun), time gates not contected to any previous content/systems are just shit.
---
Ahh thank you dorn, this helps a ton.
---
That is correct, magic find now determines what tier of unid. gear you might loot, and should not affect opening it at all.
---
Like there is companies that address issues and talk with community GGG and Paradox is an example. Anet community management always seemed like special snowflake that live in their own world.
---
Honestly I do run hotel F&amp;B outlets for a living. And ignoring any complain is the worst thing you can ever do in customer relations. yes it promotes some cases of strait customer "blackmail for compliments" but they are rather rare outside Indian customers.
---
in wvw if im playing a healer will i get kill credit if im mainly healing and not damaging enemies?
---
This is where guilds and guild networking come in handy. Convince your guild and another guild to come together and make an event out of doing the content and you’re pretty much golden. I tried on tactics like that for my griffon because people were already moved onto other things by the time I was ready for the unlock, being a returning player and all.
---
Not everybody can dedicate all their waking hours to an MMO.
---
Removed and re-downloaded, working fine now. Not sure if there was a second build released shortly after my initial download, but all good now.
---
The use of 1 thing rather than 3 is something in itself, especially when you consider you can't mount in combat. You can also use that springer+bond of faith combo into skyscale and from the devs preview it looks like you get full flight juice when mounting mid-air, this could give a lot of height but since no-one has gotten their hands on it we can't say yet. And it has greater control than the springer which yesterday while doing some of the collections in core tyria I could see the places I would want to use the skyscale over the springer and it looks like it can get to places that the springer can't. I don't see the mount being necessary, it just gives me more options.
---
if you're starting new, this is probably one of the best times to do so. there is tremendous amounts of content for you to do and outside of raids/fractals/pvp the game is very casual friendly allowing you to learn what the game is all about without any need of tutorials or guides
---
Most (all?) of the living world S2 achievements become available after you have played through the story once. So basically, you have to do the instances first for the story rewards and then replay them for achievements.
---
What if it is an infusion, but it hasn't dropped for anyone so it hasn't shown up in the API?
---
Oh, I’m looking forward to the complaints about forcing players to craft.
---
Damm i miss playing gw2 :(
---
&gt; the other thread started on release day that has images for each point
---
[Link to that thread in case anyone comes by here and wants to visit that one so they don't have to go looking for it.](https://redd.it/bomiqm)
---
Yea, getting magic find food is good only for containers that have it explicitly written on them. But using it during events is probably still good idea :)
---
You’re welcome. Good luck!
---
Yes, because the only two possibilities are not playing on weekdays while also not playing on weekends...or dedicating every waking hour to it.
---
I guess they just mean the collection items up there?
---
If you consider waiting for events a timegate, then many collections.
---
The daily reset is the problem.
---
Nice map, OP.
---
I wish I had this a couple of days ago. Heh.
---
I'm sure plenty of people will find it useful!
---
bless your soul
---
&gt; forcing food down its throat, so it grows in one day, not really reasonable
---
But why can I make it eat 3 meals and 12 treats within 10 seconds?
---
That's a great point. the precursor collections are well received. When I did Astralaria I enjoyed the trip even though it was a LOT of time and gold and a hell of a lot of activities. But each step was under my control and my choice as to when I did or didn't do them. And each group step had enough people doing them that I wasn't slowed down.
---
I'd love more content like that. doesn't have to be LW precursor length or complex. I think they are trying to do that with the upgradable armor but the execution isn't quite there yet.
---
...
---
Poster above Is right, that feature was broken and repaired Yesterday dude.
---
The research data I linked says otherwise
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Skyscale
---
Quite
---
How exactly will you word that support ticket? “I bought this item specifically to use it as an exploit, but you ruined it for me. I demand a refund!”
---
People were going nuts over the cost of Foxfire Clusters when Mawdrey came out. Lots of outrage over it.
---
The thing with timegates is that they hurt in the here-and-now moment, but once those initial weeks go by people stop caring. If the time-gating actually blocks your access to new content, then outrage becomes a bit more justified imo. Skyscale is not denying you access to new content, but it does feel like a bit much for what appears (via rent-a-scale) to be a very underwhelming reward.
---
&gt; When there is neither a time gate nor meta we all load up Dulfy on day 1 power through the content and day 2 the community starts posting that there isn't enough to do.
---
Time-gating doesn't make up for lack of content though.  There is still a finite amount of things to do, but now progress is arbitrarily blocked because you can only do so many things per day.  And the Skyscale collection in particular is fairly large, so someone like me who only plays for a few hours a day (if I even get that much time) would still take me at least a week to get through.  But now I'm pressed for time because if I can't get something done before reset, I have an entire day where I can't make any more progress.  Thanks to the time-gated aspects of the Skyscale collection, I'm waiting until every step is known so I can sit down and basically outline a schedule for when I can reasonably work toward all the goals.  And it kind of sucks that I have to do that, because now I have to let the game dictate how I spend my time on it instead of just logging in to have fun doing what I want.
---
Or I could just not go for the Skyscale at all, which I'm also considering.  But then I risk buying a random mount unlock in the future and getting a skin for a mount I don't have.
---
Granted, I don't think the hints really lead to a definitive "Phlunt is part of Inquest". They could always subvert our expectations and just make him their pawn without really being a member. Like he gets something by at least aligning with them whenever necessary, though I don't see anything that nuanced being added to the story.
---
Lmfao you're talking about arenanet, a company where 1 person does class balance and wvw has 2 devs
---
&gt; No other map was designed with the skyscale in mind because it wasn't in the game yet. The PoF and Season 4 maps were designed with Springers and Griffons in mind
---
The difference is that springer and gryphon have a natural design that is also useful in core tyria.  I.e., Cliffs to leap off and walls to jump on. They are universal, while the skyscale relies on the map to be useful.
---
NASA spec
---
Short Answer: Don't bother.
---
Long Answer: Don't bother until Anet comes to their senses.
---
This patch was phenomenal to me, and the only gripe I have aside from a few story nuances is just how not well thought out this collection was. And now all of the Skyscale news is just drowning out all of the good that came out with this patch.
---
You can DM Elon Musk to hook you up with a super computer comp and you might have 30 fps.
---
I don't even think people are complaining that much about the collection herself, like for Griffon ( and this one is better ) some complained about it but in fact I’ve seen way more people enjoy it.
---
This is amazing, thank you so much!
---
I'm not particularly well-versed in wiki formatting, but I'll see what I can do to get this added to the collection's page!
---
Yeah, Vyko made one on the official forums:  [thread](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/76525/kralkatorriks-real-size), [ED comparison](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1apknrie0B0pMFqzsHC1_6r8WZo2Zi9uV/view).
---
1. Timegating makes things longer for casual players who play at their own pace. If Anet wants something to be hard, make it challenging.
---
2. If metas are equally challenging and equally rewarding then the community will choose the ones that are fun.
---
3. Vocal minority.
---
People are upset about the timegating. Timegating does not make something more difficult, it makes content more annoying and makes people question *why do I have to wait to get these things* and breaks immersion.
---
What number is the Leystone infused branded Hydra? That's the only one missing for my coat :)
---
Still, it's use is niche af. Would be more usable if the flight juice didn't deplete so fast (And let's be real: having a "full flight" mount would make all of our lives easier. I can see the problem with it tho).
---
nope.  They changed it a while back I believe so that the raid mastery was hidden until your first raid kill.
---
If this becomes adopted as a regular thing, that would be amazing. Thanks for all your work on this!
---
I like the idea that the deep sea dragon is like Mordremoth. Its the entire see.
---
Most of the Sun Aspect skills take form in fire, light beams, and black holes. While we lack the last, we do have fire and light beams from branded.
---
But honestly, the main thing that makes me say "Sky" and not "Storm" is that the Aspects come from Glint, who's magic is the same as Kralkatorrik's the same way the Pale Tree's is the same as Mordremoth's. Even if Kralkatorrik doesn't use it in the same way as Glint, he should have all the same magic Glint did, which would include an equivalent of the Sun Aspect.
---
how is this faster than just climbing outside. you even took longer than you needed.
---
&gt; How does the Skyscale rely on the map more than the Springer or Griffon? 
---
The skyscale relies on the map making the Griffon and the Springer useless so it can shine. Like I said things like:
---
* Lots of branches to hinder griffon pullups making hard to dive and gain speed or maintain altitude. Meanwhile, skyscale can hover and use the branches to refresh the flight juice.
---
* Ledges that are juuuuust outside springer's reach, but not outside skyscale's reach.
---
* Vertical ledges stacked directly ontop of one another meaning that despite springer being able to jump that high, he can't access them because he bumps his head, while skyscale can just fly around and get on them. 
---
* Multiple large cliffs that are too close to one another for the griffon to dive and pull up, too far away for springer to jump accross, but just perfect the skyscale to climb.
---
Exist almost exclusively on dragonsfall, and don't on other maps. Overhanging ledges, multiple branches, ect don't even exist in maguma with this frequency. In most of the core tyria and maguma maps where you want to climb up a ledge, springer will do it far far faster than skyscale will, and if you want to travel across a canyon, griffon will do it far better than skyscale can.
---
A significant number of people are rushing into it for fear of timegating
---
as of now the estimate stands at 22 days if you don't have any charged quartz / huge amounts of gold on hand, or 5 days bare minimum if you do. that's reliant on the next collections not delaying the mount further.
---
if you're not in a rush it's no worry, but yeah the people who haven't started - at least of those who played this map on release - seem to be in the minority.
---
Umm. That just says it comes with the expansion, which I know. It doesn't specify if 2 come in the bundle.
---
I just pour the water over the hatchling. If it does not work on the first try I just do it again. Eventually the nest becomes clean and my baby dragon is joyful again.
---
This is awesome
---
Thought: remove the time gate for Charged Quartz. Or make a Mystic Forge recipe as a more expensive but faster route, using up some resource or other. 
---
The main things that quartz gates are a few stat combos (Commander's, Celestial, Sinister, Wanderer, and Trailblazer) and a few runes. Which... whatever? I'm not sure those really need all that much gating, esp since iirc Celestial is account bound..?
---
Who else wanted to say Washington?
---
Thanks!  I won’t be able to even start on it till this weekend, so perfect timing, thanks for doing this!
---
I'm Def digging this patch I just think k anet has done such a good job with communication and releases lately so everyone was Uber shocked and angry about the time gate as a result. They knew people would be angry. Patch would be perfect without it. 
---
I really dig the map meta!
---
Wouldn't GW2Efficiency have a bias for serious players? Casual ones probably wouldn't even know of the site, which makes me think actual percentages would be even lower
---
Yeah because they are the exact same thing
---
Because the Skyscale that is being forced on me to "grow" like a pet, so its the same thing.. do you also ride your pets and your children at the end of the process? OMEGALUL
---
Did you noticed the word forced? They could have all this shit without the timegate, if they wanted ppl to RP so be it, but others dont give 2 shits about it, so why do I have to be forced to wait?
---
&gt;So my question to the community is what would you do to create interesting, re-playable or long duration content without time gates, without making content negating activities in old zones, something that those only playing the weekends can finish and also something that those playing 6+ hours a day will take time to get through.
---
Rework PoF maps to be in line with HoT maps, rework dungeons, release a new Fractal/Dungeon/Raid with each season of the Living World. Remove timegates and add high end rewards to the new pieces of content that aren't restricted behind a timegate.
---
And the expansions are in the bundle.
---
Right, gotcha. I understand.
---
Damn, sad to hear. And yeah, the combat in GW2 is imo by far the best of all MMOs, but that's not enough to get me playing a game.
---
they are, though you might not be able to see unless you zoom in.
---
it would've made them hard to find if I made the markers bigger, so the font is kind of small. Still readable if you open the full image size.
---
There is also a place of power available for the home instance. Together with the quartz node it's been in my routine for some years.
---
For those who don't know - 1 Grow Lamp is needed to complete the Skyscale Toys collection, without which you cannot progress the skyscale mount collection of collections. 
---
Right now there are 178 Grow Lamps on the market, and the prices have skyrocketed from 9 gold yesterday to 60 gold today. Considering the fact that 178 is not so much, and will not accomodate for everyone, it is safe to assume that someone or a group monopolized this item and will supply in limited quantities to keep their profits high (supply dropped from 360 to 50 in mere hours, you can check from gw2tp).
---
Are we expecting any more demand at this point? Would the prices rise more in the next 4-5 days? Should we buy it now?
---
I had the same problem, i made all my Dust to Bloodstone Bricks 2 Days or so bevor War Eternal launched. 
---
If you have LW3 go on Bloodstone Fen (LW3e1 Out of the Shadows) and Lake Doric (LW3e4 The Head of the Snake) and farm the Bloodstone Crystals / Jade Fragments. I got more than 200 Bloodstone Dust in one run over both maps. 
---
Also a lot of Bags have a chance on Bloodstone Dust.
---
Well I am glad I am not the only one here that sees this as an absolute waste of time.  
---
There were about 10 different ways they could have done this and not pissed of the player base. They choose poorly. 
---
Nope'd right out of this bullshit, I am not doing ten damn loops for a mount not as well thought out or useful as many of my others.
---
What is a challenging about a time gate? I mean I don´t have a problem that it is harder to do but the time gate is unnecessary .
---
Yes, they should always only ask for things you already have.
---
Meetings should be short and functional.
---
They are really dodging around the issue, aren't they?
---
Will try, thank you :)
---
Let me really dumb it down for you:
---
- Mistakes get criticized, this is allowed. This doesn't make you an asshole because its what people do on a regular basis. And to be honest I don't give a fuck what you think anymore.
---
- Using insults throughout the discussion deprives you of the right to question others' wording.
---
- This wasn't a bug, a hack or a glitch. This was a function of the item they released that led to unintended consequences, and could be avoided *completely* has they tested the uses of the item thoroughly.
---
You can refer back to this comment when you get the urge to respond yet another meaningless comment that voices your opinion about complaints of others (hint: noone cares).
---
Hi, one thing I really hated about guides like Dulfy or wiki (pardon me if I sound ungrateful) are that they do not help to optimise the best route in collecting the stuff. This map allows me to because I can just follow straight lines instead of needing to continuously waypoint. So thank you.
---
In person dev meetings are the least productive thing on the planet
---
okay... so why did doing the output synth make the entire guild halls nodes unharvestable for me? i didnt upgrade a node, i upgraded the output, and then the whole series was gone when i tried to go there next. so to not interfere with my other max level, i have to be 1 tier on all nodes AND on output?
---
&gt; Just ask yourself, how illustrious would the Skyscale be in your eyes if there were 10 people in Divinitys Reach making a rainbow in the sky on the first day?
---
I wouldn't *care*, because I'm not broke-brained enough to think like that. My level of wanting a thing comes from how much I like it, and the idea that it's "prestigious" because it's a tedious pain in the nutsack to obtain never comes into it.
---
If you can only derive joy in a thing because of how much you can lord it over others, you do you, but fuck me that's a miserable way to live.
---
I want to do things at my own pace but anet decided I couldn’t feed my skyscalr more than three pieces of food per day....
---
You. are. amazing. 
---
Seriously! Maps &gt; Screenshots.
---
I think in this case Amnoon is protected by the scavenger’s causeway so a lot of the energy from the event would either be dispersed or the land surrounding the inlet would take most of the tsunami
---
I expect people will continue doing this map a long time, lots of players (myself included) like the maps with big map meta events.
---
I actually got a lot of help from screenshots on the wiki in making this map, but I found that most of them were too zoomed in or too undetailed to really get a picture of where they are without a lot of effort.
---
I figured this would help with that issue a lot, especially if the two were used together, to alleviate the trouble of trying to figure out where the heck the map is displaying.
---
Tell that to all the people who gave up on this update and won't log in for another 3 months because the whole collection turned them off
---
Jahai Bluffs is a non-Dragonfall map that is absolutely perfect for the Skyscale.
---
or you know people just wanted to buy it after seeing it in the collection 300 of them gone after reset is nothing
---
Does anything know if they rolled out a "fix" yet. Just got back into the game and I'm doing map completion on a new 80 ranger, don't want to waste my time if I'm not gonna be rewarded for doing all of it.
---
yes because I couldn't remember all the nodes :^)  I know there is like 5 of them tho haha
---
What patch was that? (if you know)
---
Desperate people and people who always want to rush...but, can't make or achieve things themselves will always fall prey to easy manipulations.
---
Welcome to economics and playing the TP 101.
---
They enabled them already
---
&gt; Let me know how easy/quick it is to grab all the volatile magic floating high up in the sky. 
---
We've been already doing that with the griffon tho. Jahai Bluffs has existed before the skyscale did and people had little to no issue at all grabbing all the flying voletile magic using it. Voletile magic refreshes the griffon's wing flap.
---
&gt;Let me know how many cliffs you can quickly climb. A lot of these things are quite difficult (if not impossible) with the griffon and springer.
---
That's false though. Jahai bluffs is one of the best maps for griffon and springer. Springer can reach most high cliffs and location and there's wide open canyons for the griffon to gain speed with pullups.
---
If I had to mention 1 map that played to both their strengths, it would be jahai bluffs.
---
&gt; Would you still like and use Twilight if the skin was a level 50 quest reward? Probably not.
---
This is a hilarious comparison because Twilight can just be bought off the AH whole cloth, no ~*~prestige~*~ required.
---
And no, the method of acquisition would not change how much I liked or didn't like it. You sound exactly like those people who immediately flip-flopped their opinion on the Celestial Steed in WoW when it went from speculation of being a rare drop from a raid boss  ("holy shit it's so cool, I'm gonna farm until my fingers bleed!") to being a store item purchasable by anyone ("lol this thing is ugly and terrible and anyone who buys this should uninstall the game").
---
If I like a thing, I go after it (unless the level of tedium outweighs my excitement and interest in the thing). That's it.
---
(And for the record, I don't even like Twilight to begin with.)
---
Us Shattercats must stick together!
---
Zoom exists.
---
That kind of overly corporate silicon valley trash is what is wrong with Anet, and modern software dev in general
---
Remember when Anet was a small company and someone saw a change that was needed, they just did it? Instead now people need to have an AGILE SCRUM STANDING WHITEBOARD PARTY^tm and meet with their manager and then their manager's manager, and then the team lead, and the stakeholders before doing something as simple as removing s a terrible design decision?
---
Meanwhile at Jagex you have devs staying up till 2am on their own time to model a better looking flowerpot for /r/2007scape just for fun. that is the kind of development that works better. Or look at what Bill Friest is going in GW1 right now, it's community fueled requests done out of passion, instead of going through the corporate machine to get people to consume the next content
---
Saved, thank you!!
---
This helps. https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy
---
So you would make twilight because you think people are admiring you, not because you actually like the skin?
---
How about people with lives and families.. yeah , its us filhty weak casuals complaining 
---
Sorry if I simply cant log on for 5 hours a fucking day
---
This games needs easy modes for all hard content and the regular difficulty should only drop cosmetics or have an earn-able title; FFXIV did it best IMO.
---
The worst part, to me:
---
[The female version doesn't have this issue.](https://imgur.com/21hrehP)
---
Cool that you're from the business! 
---
Also Anet isnt ignoring complaints, there always are respectful responses. Also when you look at their releases you can tell that certain things were done with precious feedback in mind. For example, the story difficulty was perfectly balanced for solo and group players, waypoint usage, use of masteries, type of meta events etc.

every node. went my lower guild hall upgraded to synthesis output, it became conflicting exactly with another guild hall, and only ONE hall can be harvested. not all nodes from one, and then most nodes from the other. its 100/0. all of the nodes from hall 1, then i go to hall 2 and they are ALL shown as dead/already harvested. it wasnt when i upgraded all node types to match that one, it was when synthesis output was upgraded. so does output AND node matter, or only output, or only node, or what?
---
basically, what do i make sure to NOT upgrade so that my guild hall will not conflict with the third one that is max level everything? the last tier of each node AND the last output upgrade or ...... ??????
---
&gt;**Skyscale Treat** , can i feed all food i got from killing mobs at one time? 
---
Yes
---
The problem is that it shits all over the casual player. if I had 5 hours a day to fuck with this and mine and grind. Sure .. 
---
But most, it will be at least a couple of months or more fucking with this .. it is blatant content extension
---
Really? You enjoy arbitrary grocery lists that have you backtrack to the same locations over and over again, along with waiting for events to spawn and having to do the same puzzle over and over again, followed by grinding mob kills for RNG drops? yeah thats amazing content
---
Why does every MMO do this then? You do realize there is a reason it is done. To make the game live longer. It works if it's done in moderation. For raid rewards especially it's important to not devalue them.
---
Funnier yet I am going to be a game dev, not that I would ever be part of making MMOs so this isn't really an issue I'll face ever.
---
I've just finished the main story and continue with the path of fire expansion, but man... That's so frustrating 'cause I die like 10 times per quest. My first attempt to fix this issue was to gear up a little bit according to https://forum.rockpapershotgun.com/t/no-nonsense-guide-to-gearing-up-at-level-80/9096
---
. Nonetheless, I'm still dying the whole time and can't finish the quests. I'm playing a Weaver, and since I just started playing pof have not enough hero points to skill the specialization as I want to.
---
Do you have some tips for me? I feel like most guides on YouTube are just maximizing dps,which are not fixing my problems.
---
Maybe I should stick a little bit with the main game? Thank you very much.
---
With the work you put in it, it should have been able to fly forever honestly
---
You seem to be really hung up on the time gating aspect of it. I don't love the time gating, but I do like that it will take a little while to get the skyscale. 
---
A more apt analogy would be:
---
a) you pay $5 for the pencil and go to the store to pick it up
---
b) a year later they release The Pen(tm) which can do anything the pencil can do and more, but it costs $2.50 and it gets shipped to you for free.
---
Note in the OP that I said I liked how it was arduous. If they'd remove the time-gates and locked the skyscale behind 250g and a story roughly the length of POF, I'd be fine with that too.
---
THANK YOU .. I was trying to remember the name of that bullshit.
---
&gt;impossibility
---
Its possible, but not profitable enough compared to efforts and risks involved. 
---
In best case ANet will do few smart moves that will keep players interested for enough time to bump quality of content where it necessary without pauses in development.
---
Thanks a lot for the feedback and for taking your time!
---
Lol so damn stupid.
---
Why not put those stacks in an invisible bag?
---
&gt; Voletile magic refreshes the griffon's wing flap.
---
Yes, and if you miss one or two at certain parts, you're boned.
---
&gt; That's false though.
---
Yeah, you can get anywhere with those two mounts, but in some areas, you have to go out of your way to get there, hence using “quite difficult (if not impossible)”. I'd provide examples, but I unfortunately can't be bothered to open the game and provide get screenshots. But namely, the cliffs to the east of the where the Branded Shatterer spawns. You could head up the hill east of the nearest waypoint and griffon over to the other side of the cliffs, but that's cumbersome and out of the way compared to simply wall launching your way up the cliff with a skyscale.
---
i would've liked dungeons but made new, not 2012 versions. repeatable, good rewards, unique rewards, fun fights, interesting maps instead of huge rectangle arenas etc
---
Put both in an invisible bag, or something similar, and salvage all will ignore them. That's how I've managed mine easily.
---
I don't mind the timegated and tediousness or the gold needed and whatevers but... Looking at the skyscale's abilities, it really doesn't seem worth the effort at all?
---
This amount of effort seems to correspond better with the usefulness of Griffin or sub-Legendary levels of items like the fractal backpack (but not as difficult as fractal wings)
---
&gt; You seem to be really hung up on the time gating aspect of it
---
You were negativly speaking about people having the mount on the first day, or did I only imagine it?
---
&gt; 10 people in Divinitys Reach making a rainbow in the sky on the first day? Not very. It's a prestige item
---
I'm retired. I have tons of time on my hands. That's why I'm almost rank 6k in WvW. sPvP is nothing but toxic players and PvE became boring as fuck after I got my first map completion.
---
There are only so many times you can do the hearts, and then Anet had this brilliant idea to have people do them daily.... (kill me now...).
---
These mounts are almost all complete bullshit. The raptor might as well just be a horse. The skimmer is vaguely useful when you have a long stretch of water to cross. I genuinely wish the drunken rabbit didn't exist because I prefer maps that are flatter. The jackal and rollerbug might as well not exist because I never use them and there is absolutely no need for the skyscale because Anet could just as easily have added the mastery skill for hovering and climbing to the griffon.
---
Yes I'm ranting because this game has turned to shit, but sadly all other MMO's are even shittier than this!
---
Lore wise he's dead dead. Meta wise,we injure him severely and he cocoons to heal.
---
Admire may not be the right word, but yeah players comment on how my characters look all the time. You've heard of the Fashion Wars meme before I'm hoping?
---
Mainly Fractal tips here:
---
For Deepstone, you can trigger both switches using a combination of flesh wurm/spectral walk. The pads you stand don't go from off to on straight away, but have a small transition period between both states.  Use a teleport skill and you can trigger both pads (this also applies to the energy pads section).
---
For Swamp, using a combination of flesh wurm, spectral walk and a portal device of some kind is your main go to for soloing the wisps; but you might have to reroll them to get favorable positions.
---
Chaos is normally not soloable, but currently is due to a bug where your SAS does not expire when you light a fire.
---
Undeground was previously duoable with a Necro involved, but the door now does a small amount of damage to the player upon closing, thereby preventing those that don't have an aegis/invuln skill from continuing to interact with the panel after it closes.
---
I do have other tricks (like soloing the turret room in the thaumanova fractal), but I figured I'd hit your main queries first.
---
Nice tinfoil mate.
---
I can't tell you that your opinion is wrong. Small teams working passionately get things done fast.
---
In my opinion, and from my knowledge and experience, when you want to have 200 people working together, you need managers and middle managers and stakeholders to *manage* communication. If you have 200 people making whatever art or code or music or whatver they feel like without meetings to coordinate vision and long term goals, you will have a shitty end product.
---
Remember that the formula for lines of communication is n(n-1), which means the 5 person team only has 20, but the 200 person team has 39,000. Managers facilitate those 39,000 lines of communication.
---
Yes, I can confirm. Bought both expansions and got 2 boosts.
---
Repeatable instanced content AKA DUNGEONS, RAIDS
---
&gt; Mistakes get criticized, this is allowed. This doesn't make you an asshole because its what people do on a regular basis.
---
All mistakes aren't made equal. If a baker bakes a 7 layers cake, and one of the fondant flowers is cracked, you'd be an asshole if you complained. Pointed it out, sure. Happy when they replaced it, yup. Complained that it "could have been avoided if they just spent more time on it"? No, you're an asshole. 
---
&gt; I don't give a fuck what you think anymore.
---
Yeah, keep telling yourself that buddy, ain't nobody believing that. People who don't give a fuck don't say they don't give a fuck, they just don't give a fuck.
---
&gt; Using insults throughout the discussion and behaving like an asshole* deprives you of the right to question others' wording or whether their behavior is asshole-y.
---
Oh, I wasn't aware of this new rule! Well, looks like you won't be able to comment on this any more, since you'll be so busy informing **the rest of the damn internet** that they're not allowed to call people assholes unless those people specifically use insulting names first (insinuations and snide comments are A-OK, though!). 
---
Sarcasm aside, I have just as much of a right to call you out as you have to call them, or me, or anyone else out. You don't like being called out? Tough nuggets; that's what happens when you expect perfection, you get held up to a magnifying glass yourself.
---
&gt; This wasn't a bug, a hack or a glitch.
---
...right. It was an exploit. Which I literally said in my last post, remember? "Criticizing software developers for publishing software with bugs or **overlooked exploits** is expecting perfection." Are you trying to throw shade for me not breaking "software developers" into "QA analysts" and "programmers"? That's your play?
---
Which Sun Aspect skills use actual fire (as opposed to burning immediate targets as a secondary effect from the sheer heat)?
---
&gt; Glint, who's magic is the same as Kralkatorrik's the same way the Pale Tree's is the same as Mordremoth's. Even if Kralkatorrik doesn't use it in the same way as Glint, he should have all the same magic Glint did
---
I don't agree, Glint was an independent sapient being for centuries or even millennia which is more than enough time to learn new magic or even invent it. Sylvari can wield a lot of different types of magic Mordy has no business controlling especially prior to the PS (yeah necromancy is not ED-Death but it should still rank as a more moderate opposite)
---
&gt; Aurene's fire is more prismatic and white than gold, imo.
---
Yes, the fire is a mix of her own white/blue and various orange+blue amalgamations we've seen associated with either Balthazar or his control of Primordus+Jormag's drained magic. [The specific instance](https://youtu.be/JLfbVK4bJD0?t=345) of her invoking Branding clearly is an alternating gold+Kralk purple pattern though. Strangely enough in Ep6 [the animation](https://youtu.be/frls5cHRkPU?t=237) is white with only a shred of purple and the crystal spawn could just as easily be the generic Balth+Prim+Jormag mix. So maybe they're just inconsistent overall and made her glow golden once for maximum visibility and contrast to show off that "epic moment".
---
Fair.
---
Also wanted to add that I don't mind an underwater mount even if it's a turtle. But siege turtles are special. They should be even huger in gw2 and lumber around on land.
---
They were epic back then, making it an every day mount makes nonsense to me
---
Nice.
---
Honestly, to touch on the time gate topic once: I think the biggest shock comes from looking through the achievements and seeing "damn this gets longer and longer". But overall? For all the time we've got, it's not actually too much. But that's just my opinion. Might have that opinion because of my fast paced job and I like not having to rush things.  But it sure would be cool to decide more freely about it.
---
Anets already working on improvements and I'm sure they'll be careful with timegates next time :)
---
Dunno if it's been said but a bit of QoL, when Gorrik moves to Sun's Refuge you can teleport there via the Spearmarshal's Plea for quick access.
---
Time gate actually punishes latecomers. Those who have not much time during week could keep up doing those collections during weekends but now they cant. And the gap grows with every skipped day.
---
This mount aquisition is actually against gw2 philosophy of freedom of choice and not being left out even if you cant play every day.
---
i7 4670 with 980 ti. max settings during teq is 10-20 frames. 30-40 frames if all settings are set low.
---
I'm a complete noob when it comes to this kind of stuff. I can't seem to figure out how to get the bottom icons to work, it's almost a though the app drawer is covering them. Am I missing something?
---
I personally don't mind the time gates, but I feel like they could have done it a bit more realistically? Like, for example, let us give 4 food to our skyscales every day instead of 3. Feeding a dragon hatchling every 6h feels more realistic than every 8h, and would make the wait shorter but still more than 1 day so it feels like we're really raising ourselves a dragon (in which case they should also have left out the charged quartz requirement). Having to wait a bit for your egg to hatch (aka progress from 2nd collection to 3rd) is realistic enough too but I definitely don't get the time gate between 1st and 2nd. Those two collections are comprehensive enough to take most people 2-3 days anyway, as without a time gate people would be more encouraged to take it slower
---
Basically what I'm saying is, that if they really wanted to add those time gates, they could have executed it a bit better (based on what we've seen so far). Make it feel more like an adventure where at first you're running around, and then have to step back a bit because you're looking after a dragon hatchling. And then once it's grown up enough, things should start going faster again. Hope that will be the case with the last 2 collections
---
Because there is likely a big gap between now and season 5 news. Having something to play for / aim towards keeps casual players playing over tnis period.
---
It is bad design, but likely effective.
---
charmander doesnt have wings..
---
Answer the question.
---
Yes I think it's bad for the mount to be unlockable on the first day. Take into account the Griffon, which requires you to complete POF story, do a bunch of collections, and drop 250g. Not necessarily "time gated" but it's highly unlikely that someone would be able to do that in a day. They hit a good balance with Griffon, and so far, I think they hit a good balance with Skyscale as well.
---
Becaue op is arrogant enough to think his opinion is worth its own thread :)
---
I second that. As a Brazilian player, I really wish I could support the game more but the prices and conditions to us are really hard. I had to save a lot to buy the original game and then the expacs. I only did it cause I absolutely fell in love with gw2. It's the first mmo I ever spent money on even though I've been playing them a lot. 
---
I think the Brazilian market is very promising for arena net. We're starved of good mmos, having no subs or pay to win also appeal to our players (cause being forced to pay is really hard on us).
---
Brazilians have the tendency to hold their money when they are forced to pay but they end up spending a lot when the conditions are fair (League of Legends got popular quite fast here cause the market is all optional) so I do hope we get some attention in the future.
---
Yep, no matter *what* is put into the game (or not put into the game), someone will complain.
---
To name some repeatable stuff that people enjoy: Raids, Fractals, Hopefully dungeons again someday (rewards from them are currently lackluster), buffing some metas to make them on par with others, in order to maximize diversity.
---
I know there's other stuff, but i just woke up and can't think of them off the top of my head. Mainly, as long as the journey is fun and players can go at their own pace (at least find a group that does) its no bother, and quite enjoyable.
---
Whats the end goal of time barriers? to increase player retention/playtime ... Does it even work?
---
Like if your only goal in game atm is to get the mount... When you login to do your 1 click for the day so you can progress on that front. Do you instead of logging off start doing fractals or something (if you werent already going to do them).
---
I think timegating content doesnt get players (specially new ones) playing more. Its just another thing to do for the already existing players who would be online anyway and it infact loses new players when they hit that artificial wall.
---
The solution? You want players to play more? Create more content. Thats it. Dont have all the resources to create the amount of content required for your desired player playtime/retention? reuse old assets. Intertwine new content into old one, so you dont have to start from scratch.
---
Aight, that's fine, too.
---
Honey, send children to your mom, we are moving to Hawaii.
---
I did answer your question. The answer is no. 
---
Let me ask you a question: Would Twilight be a cool or even noteworthy skin if they handed it out to every player?
---
Great stuff!
---
I can think of a number of maguuma and core tyria locations where the extra height of a skyscale, and the ability to navigate around cliffs instead of moving straight upwards, is going to make navigation easier. Ledges were only made perfectly for the springer in PoF maps, because we had the springer then. Core Tyria is not nearly as perfectly suited for it as PoF. 
---
You're looking at these things like ANet purposefully put in a bunch of blocks so that the skyscale would have use, but what's really happening is that you're noticing how they subtly changed their map making in PoF maps so that springers would be always useful for vertical navigation. Going forward, they won't be as constrained by these design limitations. They'll still probably follow them, because they can't count on everyone having a skyscale, but I bet you'll see some more complicated vertical spaces now, rather than the cliffs with suspiciously even placed ledges that we see all over Elona.
---
You're also ignoring how the skyscale is faster on ground than the griffon and springer, making it ideal for quickly getting around in varied map conditions where you need speed, verticality, and horizontal movement in fast succession. It's going to be excellent for map completion for this reason.
---
ANet.. can we get noclip mode in Guild Halls already?
---
eeww monthly achieves , get your trash idea out of here and burn it before someone else sees it
---
Well I truly believe that GW2 being "large scale" is the root of all of its problems. GW1 was much smaller in scope, but it somehow felt like each expac and patch was filled with better quality and quantity than anything GW2 has put out.
---
GW2 is very "wide" but isn't "deep" where as something like GW1 is the opposite if that makes sense.
---
I much prefer the feeling of a smaller team expanding on what works, instead of trying to reinvent the wheel over and over again and getting stuck in your own creation. Like yeah, vertical maps and the z axis are kinda cool, but now maps take 10x longer to make. Sure, fully voiced missions are nice, but now missions require recording, scheduling actors, localization, etc and now we get like 2 missions every 3 months. Yeah, multiple races are cool, but now armor skins take longer to make than it does to create a literal human being. So is all of that worth it? In my opinion no. IMO anet getting smaller is a good thing for the game. I just hope we start to see the fruits of that once the dust settles.
---
If sitting around twiddling your thumbs is all you have left to do if you can’t work on unlocking the mount due to time gating, that’s pretty sad and a good indicator that as soon as you get it and the novelty of having it wears off, you won’t even be online any more until the next major release of content.
---
whatev
---
But they said living story maps.. Dry top and silverwastes are living story maps.. So?
---
I think that they meant only maps with to scroll, since I bought TP to friend for exploring bloodstone fen (Thx for patching my intentions after buying gem store item as always..)
---
So once again, is dry top enabled?
---
You're talking about an older problem that the most recent one replicated.
---
The first week was a beautiful messy adventure. Really nailed that sense of urgency and danger around every corner. No mounts, no masteries, everything wanted to kill you. It was certainly a contrast to what came before, and it made a lot of people quit the game, but it's a bittersweet memory that is unique and I'm not sure if we'll ever feel that in GW2 ever again.
---
It should be, if you’re lvl 80
---
You know... I've done chaos recently, and hadn't even paid attention that it didn't go out, but now that you mention it... I won't count it though, since eventually the bug will be fixed, and then it won't be doable again. 
---
Swamp I can do T1, past that, I guess rerolling is the answer.
---
I already know how to solo all of thaumanova, and everything I didn't list, for fractals, it was just chaos, high lvl swamp, underground, and deepstone I hadn't figured out. 
---
Thanks for the deepstone tip though - I hadn't even actually tried it yet, I just figured since you need to hit both, unless you could skip it it couldn't be done. I didn't even think that it'd act like like the switches in other fractals.  
---
Sucks that you can't do underground though.
---
I like the idea, but disagree with the execution. This shouldn't be tied to a reset. It should start when you complete the task and be based off ingame time rather than real world. A full ingame day is around an hour. I would be fine with waiting a few hours. But timegating is just an arbitrary way of stretching out what really is just a few hours of content. Where as the griffon collection which had none of that still took some people days of work which you could still do at your own pace rather than rushing to complete a task before reset.
---
What I'm getting at is that if my girlfriend and I are doing the collection together, she shouldn't be forced to wait for the next step because she was a few minutes late due to the game disconnecting her and then kralk nuking the map right as she was about to talk to gorrik to finish her current step.
---
this is where id put my skyscale
---
IF I HAD ONE
---
Also [Austin Powers](https://i.imgur.com/KCeGdAI.png), inspired by "Robin183".
---
It should be if you’re lvl 80
---
Cray 5,000,000.
---
See, you do it again. You try to justifiy the personal desire for something with what other people think about it. 
---
Asuming I would like skin, yes, I would still like the skin, even if every player had it, because *I like it*.
---
Again, this shit has nothing to do with me.  I compiled a list of complaints from my guild and the map chat over the course of 8 hours.
---
Go fucking bug someone else.
---
There are! They were a hidden mount released in path of fire and they're pretty tricky to get, but they're there.
---
Well, it was about immersion with the skyscales, at least the parts without the quartz crystals. I dont agree with the wait though
---
I know I am in the minority here obviously but we have 4 months before the next episode launches. There isn't much need to get everything done by day 3.
---
comparing a mount that squeezes in somewhere between springer and griffon to the only legendary trinket we have access to so far is pretty bold.
---
i would quietly applaud their sternness to power through the acquisition process, and out of envy attempt to do so as well asap.
---
right now people are encouraged to make progress each day to meet their deadline, and because said deadlines are as harsh as they are, people become selfish about reaching them. in a more open system - the one we had for aurora for example - people didn't feel nearly as pressured, and waited with tasks to do them with their friends etc.
---
and can we stop with the druid stone comparisons? that is content which was released with the episode before aurora, and between "flashpoint" and "one path ends" there were three months of downtime during which farming a bit for 4 individual backpack skins was easily doable without missing out on anything else in game.
---
Are those glasses drawn on? 😆
---
Nice! now go hunt some bounties and you are there.
---
I don't think they downsized anywhere near enough to get to what you're looking for. They may reduce management overhead some, but I don't know if it will increase their flexibility notably.
---
Focusing on a single product, though, should increase volume!
---
I do aggree that I see a lot of value in well-coordinated small teams, as long as they know their strengths and weaknesses. GW1 (which I haven't actually played much of) doesn't have constant voiceovers, high res textures, or jumping, but the expansions had a ton of content and lore.
---
I would argue that large teams doing GW2 style high-quality, but slow and probably shallow, production vs small teams doing great quality fast and deep production aren't better or worse, just different. For different audiences, really.
---
Shared inventory slot for me. Three shared spots for each of the three types.
---
They’ll auto fill into the shared spots as they drop (as long as you have one in there) and it covers all your characters.
---
Stacks full and bags full? Jump on another character, ID and salvage in their less full bags.
---
huh, that wasn't even so long ago. Thanks for pointing this out.
---
This guy made a [straight list of materials needed.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bpkzm7/raising_skyscale_guide/envz8ab/)
---
i gotta say
---
this turned into a pretty decent conversation instead of the usual flame war i've come to expect on this sub
---
Feels so good to be screwed. They didn't say a word about it when they put rechargable TP to friend. Still trying to milk us and nothing more.
---
But whatever, I love spending money on fun things instead of wasting money on iPhone and similar thingies.
---
It's the "Wide Rim Glasses" :)
---
Hard to argue when there literally is no difference between what you would consider afk farming and what you're advertising, am I right.
---
Good luck with the afk farm though, make sure to stay alert at your pc so you dont get banned! :)
---
The problem is that this isn't the first time Anet has done this to fill out the space between Living World releases with artificial content, it's the cheapest and laziest way possible for making people stick around.
---
In my opinion, Living World format has always been a terrible idea that drains their resources and doesn't introduces anything meaningful. I'd be OK with the stry if every expansion they put everything into it, and the living world releases were instead new content like raids, fractals, PVP modes, etc.
---
Antipog for me, would've bought this infusion instantly
---
Rework is a very vague term and easy to say. It leaves the details of how exactly to rework to someone else which brings us to our current problem that the decisions ANet does are not meeting the communities wants.
---
And GW2 does release a new fractal and raid every season.
---
I crafted mine for 0
---
That’s what I was thinking as to why it was red as well.
---
The texture of that part matches the butt cape/skirt perfectly, so you would assume they would give the option to dye them the same way to match.
---
Hopefully they patch it.
---
Pretty sure they were adding a new fractal or raid with each episode. They did tell us in advance, that ep6 will be an exception, since the raid wing needs more polish
---
I'm not posting in this thread to discuss any perceived problems with the way it has been implemented. Due to not being able to play much during the week I'm only halfway through the first collection and will be lucky to have the second part completed by Monday evening. I'm still not convinced that is all that egregious of a time sink unless subsequent steps are far worse.
---
Glad I could subvert your expectations. :)
---
Yeah, I said I don't give a fuck *anymore*, if you read. Please actually refer back to what I said in my previous comment. I have only repeated myself so far, and any opinions about the fact that I criticized the devs' mistake are addressed there.
---
I think a good idea would be to just implement the timegates differently.
---
Right now, you complete one collection and then the timegate starts and unlocks the next one at reset. If instead the timegate started the moment you made progress on the collection, it would feel less gated and less like you're forced to do exactly that amount of content in one day.
---
So to be clear, right now you start the achievement and nothing happens. You spend who knows how long on completing the achievement and the next achievement half-unlocks (the content requirements are fulfilled). Then you can't progress any more for that day and on reset, the second requirement is fulfilled and the next achievement unlocks.
---
In the proposed system, you start the achievement and the timegate immediately starts. The next achievement in the chain will have its timegate requirement fulfilled at reset. You can play the achievement you're actually working on in the meanwhile if you want to, or you can play it the next day.
---
This won't make an actual gameplay difference for players that do the entire achievement in a day, but it will make a difference for players who don't finish the entire achievement in a day or just play less frequently. If you only do half of Newborn Skyscales on the first day, Saving Skyscales would still half-unlock on reset (the content requirement still not being met). If you then log in the next day, or the next week, you can finish Newborn Skyscales and immediately start progress on Saving Skyscales. As soon as you start progress on Saving Skyscales, the timer for Raising Skyscales starts just as described above.
---
The journey would still have the same minimum amount of days required (you still would have to wait two resets between starting Newborn Skyscales and starting Raising Skyscales, and one reset between starting Saving and starting Raising) but it'd give you the freedom to play just half of Newborn on the first day without feeling like you're falling behind and to then play both the second half of Newborn and all of Saving on the next day because that's the weekend and you have lots of time.
---
Thank you for your help!  Yeah, I read Trailblazer's was on the expensive set so I went with the dire set instead so that I could use Exotic insignias.  I've been using the wiki pretty extensively too, it's very useful.
---
I just got these boots and noticed I couldn't dye that part and just went back to the normal version of the boots.
---
I'm not talking about specific individuals but the general trends.
---
No problem! Yeah, it can be cheaper to make another stat set sometimes. I personally don't bother with doing that. Like someone said, I would recommend getting the rebreather from Bitterfrost Frontier. It's easy and doesn't cost gold.
---
Somehow it works fine now, i just downloaded it to desktop and after copy &amp; paste it in the bin64 folder, not works perfectly fine. You guys should try again. (todays small gw2update maybe fixed it, but not sure)

Here, this guy made a full breakdown.
---
I have an 8700k and GTX 1080, play at 1440p - My FPS will be close to 30 during World Bosses or meta's at max settings (though I have player count set to Medium).
---
Well, I just finished downloading GW2 and thought I'd come here and ask four simple questions before I get started later tonight. Can GW2 be played using a click based style, can firebrand do decently with a axe&amp;shield + greatsword set up, Is weaver truly that hard and complicated to play and any expansion sales going on in game(a little too broke right now to buy HoT and PoF right out the gate atm)? Thank you for your time
---
Disclaimer: I *don't* have issues with the amount of PvE game content.  I do play PvE, but all I really want is more stuff for WvW, such as some new maps.
---
Most games deal with end-game content through  PvP and/or vertical progression.  PvP can inherently be end-game because the challenge is dynamic.  If you get better, then you could match up against better players, for example.  And your opposition could get more skilled as well.
---
For PvE, most games add content through vertical progression, whereas GW2 is based on horizontal progression.
---
One concept I've toyed around with in my head is **localized** vertical progression.  That is, vertical progression that only has an effect in a specific slice of the game such as within a living world season.  The key is that outside that part of the game, the vertical progression has no effect.  We already see an example of this with WwW rank: it is vertical progression within a game mode that means nothing outside that area.  This is in contrast with, say masteries, that carry over to other areas of the game.
---
This is key, because it allows for more latitude in vertical progression without skewing other parts of the game or gating other content behind this progression.  It would be necessary to make sure that no *mechanical* rewards are unique to this part of the game.  Needing this progression for a mount unlock (unless the mount can only be used locally) would be a bad idea.  Achievements, titles, cosmetics, etc would all be fair game to lock behind this.
---
Obviously *some* progression is required for mounts.  And that's fine so long as it isn't too onerous for players that aren't looking for this more advanced content.  My point is that localized vertical progression could be taken a lot further since it wouldn't put others at a disadvantage if they choose to skip it while still providing rewards for those who do participate.
---
The challenge here is to make content replayable without disadvantaging those who *don't* replay it.  This is not a simple problem.
---
Yea i suspect a lot of people are in that category. People logging in to do  couple mins of clicking gets them basically nothing right? I think they would have gained more retention if they just added another page/part to the collection of random things collected all over the world(for no reason) that toke an extra hour/two/etc. 
---
Theres also another way to get players to play more, but its a bit taboo in this game... You can always make content more challenging. You know, so you require more from the player other than his time.
---
this shows the full material breakdown required? so only 22 charged?
---
I disagree. There is no one game system that will please 100% of players. I also disagree that there are any “OBJECTIVELY BAD” additions to video games. Every system ever implemented has had supporters, even the time gates. I submit that your attitude is the unproductive one, here.
---
my friend with i7-8700, 32 gb ram and RTX2070 says that he have 20-25\~ FPS on max settings in crowded fights with d912pxy.
---
I was surprised a bit :D
---
Should this not go in the Skyscale megathread?
---
That doesn't actually change my original  statement though. You said that people who want to put work into the mount will get it. I want to put work into the mount, but the game won't let me.
---
So the only real way to get kills are the escort achievements? This takes ages, because the branded enemies don't count..
---
For me I loved Jahia Bluffs and wish they did every living season like that. Story was interesting and meaningful, the meta is fun to do which I still do a few times a week even though you don't get a ton of gold, and the collection was the best I'd ever seen, no time gates, special loot, armor and the items you collected showed up in the sunspear refuge. Basically it was perfect and kept me playing the map for months, if arenanet released something on par with that every time I'd have nothing to complain about.
---
 
---
## Imagine going up the cliff and not using your skyscale mount
---
It seems people are taking this to seriously lol
---
Alolan Exeggutor is only half dragon type. Best pick a Pokemon that's only dragon, like Goomy.
---
&gt; That's not true. It can only return to the height from which it dove. 
---
That's literally what I said. "Regain its original altitude".
---
&gt;And not even that is always true (e.g. hitting in obstacle, flying too far (which gradually slows you down), etc.). So if you fuck up and are already below the volatile magic, you're likely boned unless you have another way to get back to where you left off.
---
I mean yes? That's the whole point of the griffon's skill curve. Learning how and when to do pullups without crashing in order to keep level flight.
---
&gt;which gradually slows you down)
---
This is why you use aerial finesse. Its what allows you to maintain permenant flight, or at least flight long enough that you can cross the entirety of tyria 10 times over.
---
To me it's this or 22 day timegate cause I don't have any charged quartz -.-
---
Been very tempted to sell a couple with all the charged quartz I've saved up from that node as well. However, I'm not going to do it until people are on collection #5. I just know if I go and make a bunch if lamps and get rid of it all, collection 4/5 will both require them or some new recipe with them.
---
And if they don't, well this price won't be going down anytime soon as everyone hitting Collection 3 will need it and with all the timegates to making it I can't imagine it'll drop low again for a long time.
---
Imagine complaining this much about a time gate when you don't actually like the game.
---
The griffon was done just right, with the nod to the Sunspears and Tahlkora.
---
In general we get much better stories when we stick to GW1 figures than their dragon Mary Sues and the obnoxious family trip writing filled with constant quips in what I expect to be a high fantasy setting.
---
When do you do that? When can I join? :D
---
Identify blues and greens, fuck yellow ones.
---
you are now reposting for others?
---
&gt; See, you do it again. You try to justifiy the personal desire for something with what other people think about it. You propably do it unconsciously. 
---
My "personal desire" is to create cool and unique looking characters, when I'm looking at skins anyways. Nice armchair psychology tho.
---
&gt; Asuming I would like skin, yes, I would still like the skin, even if every player had it, because *I like it*. I have Nevermore because I like the big twig and the spirit raven around it, eventhough you see it fucking everywhere. 
---
This is a lie. You may still like the skin, but it loses lots of it's lustre when literally everyone can get it easily. Once again, Fashion Wars 2.
---
&gt; Can GW2 be played using a click based style, 
---
Not reasonably.  You'll need to primarily use your keyboard.
---
&gt; can firebrand do decently with a axe&amp;shield + greatsword set up 
---
That's certainly not meta, but that sounds like a solid offensive/defensive build for open world content.
---
&gt; Is weaver truly that hard and complicated to play 
---
The meta Sword Weaver build is extremely hard to master.  Staff weaver is a bit easier, but still one of the harder builds in the game.  Weaver is squishy and has tons of skills to learn.  It is also very fast paced, and is a huge DPS loss if you mess up. 
---
&gt;any expansion sales going on in game 
---
It's on sale right now from the main [Guildwars2.com](https://Guildwars2.com) store!
---
Mount skins that are unlockable by achievements. Pvp and Wvw themed skins that are unlocked via collections and or achievements would be excellent. I mean there is a mount that is used only in WvW we need a reason for more people to take interest in those game modes. Those collections can be gated however the hell they want to because they are cosmetic and not an entirely new mount.
---
https://reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bpkdja/game_update_notes_may_16_2019/
---
Thats exactly what i hear.
---
The food is seperate from the feeding dragon achievement. the hunting enemy for meat can all be fed in a day, the crafting with charged crystal is limited 3 a day
---
Casuals shouldn't care if they fall further behind. Those aren't considered casuals, those are invested players.
---
In what way does a time-gate allow casuals to catch up to players that are more invested? Both will hit the time-gate, although at different times. The gap will stay the same.
---
Oh I have like my legendary, the difference between me and you being I didn't do it so people look at my Bifrost No. 28946. (check out my prestige and cool skin!)  
---
You failing to understand such a simple concept just makes me sad more than anything, cheers fam
---
Just saying, but WoW sees that just the same. A new content patch drops, they see a resurgence of players for like a month tops, then back to the same. People realize "This gear is pointless because it will just become obsolete in 2 months anyway, so why bother?"
---
It's absolutely becoming an increasing sentiment on the WoW sub to literally just not play an expansion until the last few months after everything is released, so you can just take it at your own pace and upgrade all at once.
---
Your statement has merit, but both systems are bad for that. Vertical gear systems like WoW don't "interact with the world", it's literally just making numbers bigger. That's why they've to gear squish, and they project having to squish their gear again by the end of next expansion. 
---
In my understanding, Guild Wars 2 has always been about the journey instead of the destination. I haven't felt like I've gotten more powerful on my guardian in 6 years, but I don't care at all because I don't see a need to *feel* more powerful. If you want to feel stronger, that's fine, but you should re-evaluate what constitutes meaningful growth because Vertical gear progression does not necessarily make a difference.
---
post-devourer nerf*
---
which honestly, is what exactly? that you think people who are treated like children are in fact children?
---
Marjory's gonna field a report for unqualified practices.
---
Speaking of which, where the hell are Marjory and Kasmeer anyway?
---
Don't time gate mounts. Cosmetics are fine, people might not like it but they will ignore it. Mounts are gameplay enhancements, they shouldn't be timegated.
---
Almost as bad as elementalists
---
Dry Top and Silverwastes still remain as some of the game's best reward systems.
---
Just copy them? No need to try to find new formulas over and over again when you already got something decent 5 years ago.
---
Thanks for taking the time to answer! 
---
While I'm Happy for the sale and firebrand, I'm sad about weaver and that I can use my normal play style. I have an extremely hard time playing pc games that are not click based(my left arm was partially disabled due to an accident. Makes it very hard to move through all the keys so I normally just have it resting on the WASD keys to focus on movement since I can still move my fingers while I use the mouse for everything else). Wont stop me from trying to play this game though.
---
One last thing would necro(reaper) or Mesmer be an easier alternative to the magical swordsman idea? Thanks for your time.
---
Did you know Log Horizon was inspired by Everquest?
---
I too am an Enchanter junkie. The niche that no longer exists in other games can be found in Mesmer which I main and am an enthusiast of.
---
this rose has THORNS ;)
---
here they are ;)
---
&gt; This is a lie. You may still like the skin, but it loses lots of it's lustre when literally everyone can get it easily. Once again, Fashion Wars 2.
---
Not for me. I like it the same way as the day I made it 2 years ago.
---
I only have PoF. Thanks but I Already read metabattle and I still dont know if I should run d/p or p/p which is why im asking you guys
---
God damn I'm a dumbass
---
Also...
---
* New PvP maps
---
* PvP Weapons
---
* PvP Legendary armor
---
* New Reward Tracks
---
* PvP Lobby rework
---
And if you gonna say that PvP lobby rework isn't sufficient, i'm gonna say that FFA arena is exactly that thing, that every game should have.
---
imagine trying to defend time gated stuff inside time gated stuff....
---
just in case you're not joking, [heres what i mean.](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Scorpion)
---
Not another skyscale rant....and yours doesn't even make sense.
---
Wish I had this 7 years ago. Awesome job.
---
4 days of feeding so I imagine then
---
&gt; What do you think GW2 has to gain from timegating in regards to shareholders? 
---
Engagement numbers. Its really obvious. You show players logging in every day and it looks great in excel. "Look we have players logging in everyday."
---
I figure this didn't even require explaining.
---
&gt;What I think the timegating serves, trying to look at it from the dev/publisher point of view, is to stagger this “gotta have it right now!!!” mentality that people have, where they unlock something big on day1 of release and then complain for the next few months that there’s nothing to do.
---
Except you seem to not realize something.
---
There is still NOTHING to do. You log in for 5 minutes, do the collection and quit again. What is there for you to do other than do what you would do anyway, and then go away until the next timegate?
---
&gt;A lot of us who ar used to only playing a couple of hours a day have no problem with the timegating because we’re used to setting long term goals to achieve small feats. To us it’s just another thing to work towards over time, and we have the patience. 
---
Oh I see now. You think the entire world revolves around you and everyone should be forced to do things how you like them, because you're spehsul or something.
---
Well that explains a lot about your statements in retrospect now.
---
&gt;It’s not even particularly that egregious of a timegate either. So it’ll take you about a week maybe to unlock, so what?
---
It takes 9 days minimum and that is assuming you do everything within 1 daily cycle and you have either 140 gold to spend or 22 quartz crystals. Otherwise it takes 31 days minimum for you to craft the food and the grow lamp, and again, this is assuming that you make full use of every single day.
---
Fighting anything alone I think. She came to help pick me up after I was getting chain knockdowned by some mushrooms
---
man i need to level up the griffin
---
But that's perfect for easy "redeemed villain" trope. We might still see it at a later time anyway
---
I do agree. I hate not getting at least XP. I understand about the loot but at least XP should be granted.
---
There are Phantasms that do that like Phantasmal Defender and the clones can take aggro. But you will almost always steal aggro from them as aggro is always based off dps unless there are specific mechanics involved.
---
No timegates accomodate both groups of players. Timegates only accomodate one.
---
&gt;It’s not even particularly that egregious of a timegate either. So it’ll take you about a week maybe to unlock, 
---
It takes 9 days minimum and that is assuming you do everything within 1 daily cycle and you have either 140 gold to spend or 22 quartz crystals. Otherwise it takes 31 days minimum for you to craft the food and the grow lamp, and again, this is assuming that you make full use of every single day and miss no timegates.
---
&gt;so what?
---
"So what" is that I want to play the game at my pace. I am willing to put the work in, so why shouldn't I be allowed?
---
you can probably find it on their YouTube or official website
---
The griffon chads strike again
---
Whats the avg Profit per hour?
---
How much Gold, VM etc.?
---
Got it when I was doing story in the Embers area. Fighting a hydra, then Aurene came and KS'd it. XD
---
If you have issues with using a keyboard, I know there’s an MMO mouse with like 15 buttons on the side that some people use.  It’ll help minimize keybinds.
---
Reaper is the best beginner class in the game.  It is powerful even if you suck at it, but it also provides a reasonably challenging rotation to bring the class up to its maximum potential.  Like Weaver, it has virtually no utility, but it’s super tanky and you can have minions to draw agro from you.
---
Mesmer is probably Guild Wars 2’s most unique class and has a ton of different builds.   Chronomancer has both a powerful DPS build, and the best Supporty DPS build in the game. It manipulates it’s cooldowns with its time manipulation mechanic so the class has a bit of a learning curve.  But in my opinion, people overblow how hard the class is to learn.  Plus, the DPS build is still pretty decent even if you haven’t mastered it.
---
Mirage is a top tier condition damage DPS class with great mobility.  A lot of Mesmer players prefer Mirage when playing solo, but I don’t play it enough to have an opinion on that matter.
---
Is it possible to pay gems to skip the timegating, or am I missing something? What is your point, OP
---
Drama, told mods
---
I'll do tonight when I get off around 11est. Bring engi friends
---
If the thought of having to log in over a few weeks rather than grinding it out in a day or two would actually stop you from coming back to the game, be honest: if you were able to grind the skyscale out in a few days, you wouldn't stick around very long after that either.
---
Yeah i came back for this update to play around with the new mount, stopped playing after the story immediately when i noticed the timegate on the *only thing that made me come back*. TESO is releasing a pretty cool new expansion in 3 days, if GW2 disappoints it makes the decision even easier.
---
&gt; Well, according to Taimi, necromancy is the same as ED-Death (which opens a shit ton of contradictions in lore when applied with a certain foe in A Crack in the Ice... Same with elementalists using ice and fire magic).
---
I mean they're probably the same primary component in the "spectrum" but the domain is "pure" while (sylvari) necromancy will have "white"/other components mixed in. It's only the dragon corruption itself which annihilates with its antithesis, we don't see regular plants reacting excessively to death magic, same for the few mixes of fire/lava+ice/snow/water.
---
&gt; Glint to learn sun magic specifically *and nothing else* separate from Kralkatorrik
---
I dunno, Auric magic and her "echoes" as well as the TARDIS lair are well beyond Kralk's *intellectual* capacity and the Herald facets are broader too. Plus I don't recall Glint *herself* ever using Sun magic (nor the others for that matter) so she could have invented it and taught it to the Zephyrites as a benevolent spin "inspired by" Kralk but using regular elementalist traditions.
---
&gt; can be corrupted by Elder Dragons
---
I *think* you linked to the wrong page there, any "facet" spawned by Glint would still trace its heritage back to Kralk and share the "crystal resonance" thing. 
---
&gt; like the Pale Tree and most minions which are limited to the powers of the corruption that converted them.
---
We know the corrupted can maintain access to powers, abilities and magic they held before becoming dragon minions though that bit might have been unique to Zhaitan initially. Sylvari and Aurene are not second generation "minions" because their creators were purified beforehand although they do seem to be limited to the same physical framework as the progenitor ED.
---
I like to think I'm popping it in the face when I "play" with it using the ball.
---
Reposted due to drama. Deleted previous. Blocked those users
---
correct me if I am wrong here but neither mawdrey or the golem pack back from sandswept had locked collections that didnt open until the next daily reset hit. Sure there were time gating crafting and you could only turn in 1 program thing to the golem per day, but once those things were done you could start the next step right away. The game didnt put another arbitrary time gated on your progress because reasons.
---
&gt; Example 3: wvw pips.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; You get to play wvw on your terms and make meaningful progression even though the rewards are effectively timegated by the number of tickets you can get per week.
---
Exactly, and that is likely a reason most of my time is spent in WvW. My own pace, and people will always be more challenging than AI. 
---
&gt; Converse that with the skyscale.  You must absolutely reach a threshold before daily reset.  If you miss it by 10 minutes, you must wait 24 hours.  However players that like to play fast or more often are only allowed to make minuscule progression per day.   Theres a giant neon sign basically saying,  YOU HAVE PLAYED ENOUGH OF THIS CONTENT TODAY.  GO DO SOMETHING ELSE.
---
Yep. And for many that SOMETHING ELSE **will be a different game.** Myself included.
---
I don't understand, I've killed all the mobs for the items and none of them count towards the collection and I can't do anything with the hatchling.
---
Actually it does since the mount will always be there so people who want it actually have to go there so there will be much more people there constantly. I bet that the mount also needs Dragonfall map currency so farming the meta is needed.
---
can I gain mastery exp for spirit shards with incomplete masteries still open?
---
I've barely had time on the map, but I'm noticing little things. 
---
Being able to trade in VolMag for previous maps' currencies, for example. 
---
Anyone have other little-known likes of the new map, rewards, etc? I'm eager to hear 'em.
---
There are a lot of veteran mobs and normals so essentially more engies=less ttk= more profit. I'd love to get some testing done if you're willing to help tonight
---
Having mounts make me never noticed that. I'm sad now
---
Just to think massive ices falling apart already cause tsunamis IRL, no need to fall from out of orbit for that either.
---
I can do my daily thing and leave the map.
---
The amount of time spent in the map remains the same.
---
Oh god DAMNIT that's a cute screenshot
---
&gt; There is still NOTHING to do. You log in for 5 minutes, do the collection and quit again.
---
If you find the game that boring then what are you still doing playing, let alone moaning about something completely optional?
---
I just came back from a hiatus since pre-expansion and I’ve had no shortage of stuff to do, even after pushing my way through HoT and PoF I’ve been engaging in PvP, WvW, Fractals, Raids, revisiting dungeons I remember doing back in the day, I’ve even spent a good amount of time helping players who are just starting out, and even just putting progression aside occasionally just to enjoy the social environment. There’s so much to do in GW2, it honestly puts other MMOs to shame.
---
&gt;Oh I see now. You think the entire world revolves around you and everyone should be forced to do things how you like them, because you're spehsul or something.
---
I’m not the one bitching and moaning about free additional content that’s entirely optional to do buddy. From where I stand, the whiners are the ones who look like they think the world revolves around them, the sense of entitlement is astounding.
---
&gt; It takes 9 days minimum and that is assuming you do everything within 1 daily cycle and you have either 140 gold to spend or 22 quartz crystals. Otherwise it takes 31 days minimum for you to craft the food and the grow lamp, and again, this is assuming that you make full use of every single day and miss no timegates.
---
Are you a well rounded MMO player? Because as far as time gating and attentive investment goes, this is actually pretty lax compared to other MMOs, with one key difference. In other MMOs you got a roadblock where you pretty much can’t progress without completing the timegated slog, whereas this content is 100% optional and doesn’t stand in your way for any of the other content available. You sound like GW2 was your first and last MMO.
---
&gt;"So what" is that I want to play the game at my pace. I am willing to put the work in, so why shouldn't I be allowed?
---
Because the whole point of MMOs is to be engaged in something for a long time. In the early 2000’s, it used to be that you’d set long term goals in an MMO and through great effort, you’d eventually achieve them a year or so later. Now everybody wants everything spoon fed to them right now, like that girl in Charlie and the Chocolste factory “**I WANT IT NOW!**”
---
To me it sounds like MMOs just aren’t for you, you’d be in less distress if you just found some single player titles to play. 
---
You were literally handed new and engaging content and instead of saying thanks, you’re shouting “FUCK YOU THIS ISN’T FAIR.” lol. It’s honestly pathetic.
---
Try medium karma shoulders
---
It actually is. Buy gems -&gt; convert to gold -&gt; buy grow lamp + foods. 22 days skipped.
---
PvP still beats most mmos in my opinion simply because this game has a fun combat system. 
---
Balance isn’t at its best but also not its worst. Some things are over the top but anet has been better recently at patching regularly so you can’t get too comfortable with something that’s easy and broken.
---
It is pretty amusing how you basically spike the little dude in the face to "play" with it.
---
It's still needed to actually go to the map unlike any other ls map.
---
Griffon is behind a goldwall and general consensus seems to be that it's much more reasonable.
---
What the fuck has skyscale time gate to do with Anet generating money? I want to have your creativity.
---
Cheers, let me start with I will mention some minor spoilers from current stuff. Well, i think it was during LS2 that the twin sword's arc was touched in that episode where Rytlock jumps in a portal for Sohothin (Dragon's Reach i believe?). But they only refer that if a true heir to Ascalon's throne shows up with both swords the Foefire shall be lifted, but they do not develop the story any further. But given that during last LS4 episode Rytlock mentions that he is blood brother with Logan now, i would not be too surprised that Magdaer somehow finally comes back into the fold in Logan's hands for some reason in the upcoming chapters. But i have to concur, it feels like a huge waste to just leave the story at the sword having been restored by a smith friends with Eir and ending up as a toy to his daughter or something similar (thats from when we go pay homage to our late friend in Hoelbraek i believe).
---
Charr mirage is so cool.... I like that axe 2 animation, grace and agile on big cat.
---
Thanks for answering!. Mesmer sounds interesting, especially Chronomancer(shattering time sounds broken AF). Just one thing. Can Necro be built to not use minions? I've had some really bad experiences with minion classes. *shivers in horror from WoW memories where hunter pets pulled EVERYTHING!!!*
---
Yeah? You have to do collections and all that.
---
You know, the things that timegate is preventing you from doing
---
Over the years I've salvaged roughly 500,000 Unid's, both before and after identifying.
---
* The chances of getting a higher tier piece of equipment (below Exotic,) is roughly 1 to 5 times out of 50 Unid's.
---
* The chances of getting an Exotic from a green is roughly 1 per 250.
---
* The chances of getting a Precursor is roughly 1 per 250,000.
---
With that said, you still have to allocated the amount of time you spent identifying, managing inventory space, and salvaging every individual item in contrast to just using Salvage All on a stack.
---
What is worth more to you, a few silver on the dollar or your sanity?
---
Interesting topic. In the wiki it says 
---
&gt; Eir: Magdaer is shattered, but I know a blacksmith who can mend these pieces.
---
So the flame is propably gone but who other than Balthasar can reignite it?
---
&gt; lying up and forward as far as your blue bar will take you
---
Isn't it Green?
---
Time gated stuff in an MMO is literally the name of the game, moron. They live and die on how well they stagger the time it takes the users to consume the content. Timegating the skyscale is no more aggregious than not giving you the full gear set from a raid on your first clear.
---
If you got charged quartz its minimum 9 days (Assuming collections 4 and 5 don't have any more timegates), if you got no charged quartz its 31 days.
---
I want to be the guy being punched by the black guy....but GW2 says I must be an elf or Pauly D
---
Lots of EU and other parts of world players(other than US) now comparing years ago.
---
-
---
So it is not deserted. I can see players everywhere(Map completion goal).
---
Thanks for the comment!
---
I would have liked to see a few hints like this dropped in game via mail in the time between the episodes, such as a letter from Caithe or Brahm asking where we are. And yes, for future players stringing those two instances together may be quite jarring.
---
Power Warrior uses GS in raids/fractals. Guardian, specifically Dragonhunter uses GS. Power Reaper uses GS. Power Soulbeast uses GS. Daredevil uses Staff, as does Druid, some Elementalist builds. Thats all I can think of off the top of my head.
---
autorun into a wall, then you can turn your mouse as much as you want
---
I hope so. I've been looking for ways to... ''dismiss'' my springer.
---
i got the warclaw in like 30 minutes flat, where were you whineys when they released it?
---
Astralaria's an interesting example since the first collection has a 12-step timegated achievement in it.
---
&gt; A complete straw man argument, 
---
You made a bullshit argument and got a bullshit response.
---
Either nothing is mandatory or nothing is optional. 
---
Its part of the game as much as the mount is, no more no less.
---
The reason you're not responding further is because you realized you wrote yourself into a corner and you wanted an easy way out to avoid losing even more face than you already did.
---
&gt; I don’t even need to read the rest to know that the entire comment is garbage, you’re trying to turn the tables and say that I’m the one complaining about shit, but it’s normal to be annoyed by a buzzing fly. The fly’s opinion of the person who’s annoyed by it doesn’t really matter. Anyway I’m pretty much done here, there’s nothing I can say to reason with you, you’re just going to keep being audibly upset about literally nothing anyway. Later.
---
Were you born like this, or did you become like this after the accident?
---
Chronomancers are very decent (I have one and I love it). Shattering is powerful, but not broken (it used to be very easily overpowered, but it's more balanced now).
---
Phantasms are basically damage over time with a secondary effect, and they often drawn aggro away from you. You have to be okay with pink butterflies and purple explosions, because mesmers are not subtle with their visual effects. It's like reality distorting murder Barbie. 
---
I'm not that experienced with necros, but I don't see why not. Rangers are the only mandatory-pet class (and yes, they pull everything if you don't control them).
---
You absolutely nailed Tybalt! Nice job!
---
Tbh, I thought it was hidden, too. But I looked at my alt account an [as you can see](https://imgur.com/06megoV) it's visible, but locked, just like all other mounts (except griffon). I unlocked the episode on release, and I can asure you, that [I never even played the episode](https://imgur.com/r1EnKwb), so I'm not lying. 
---
Yesterday the Skyscale was both, visible and locked, just like the Rollerbeetle in the first pic. Luckylie they patched it and it's hidden now. Ironically the Rollerbeetle is still visible.
---
If they added more cosmetics via either rare drops or collections I would definitely play GW2 more often.  It's annoying that for a lateral progression game that is even self proclaimed about cosmetics at endgame we get so little new armor.  It's exciting when we get even one new cosmetic set.
---
I get that cosmetics is also what their shop is all about, but it's still discouraging when you see the cash shop so directly competing with one of the core elements of GW2's endgame.  We really need to get more *earnable* cosmetic rewards, even extending past just armor and weapons if possible.  And no, being able to buy store cosmetics via farming gold does not count.  While it's possible to just farm gold to get the shop cosmetics, just putting everything behind farming the most efficient world quests is not very engaging content not to mention having it be possible to simply buy said gear removes any real element of "meaning" from said rewards.
---
Whatever you have to tell yourself to feel better about yourself homie :)
---
Where is the guy who made the Rytlock Springer? We need him!
---
Definitely after the accident.
---
Not even nature makes mistakes this big.
---
You should try both builds and see which you like best.
---
Or drown it when pouring the water bucket over it.
---
There should be a domination power chrono build on snowcrows.com that uses a greatsword
---
I'd love them to steer the focus on this replayable content first. They can make stories but still make them replayable: keep the map releases but instead of solo story instances introduce a variation on dungeons integrated with open world content (maybe like ESO trials?).
---
Feels like they want to abandon raids. They're just not fit for this game.
---
Focus on validating already existing content (Guild content, features that were promised – Build templates, Cooking 500 and food overhaul).
---
1 Elite spec each release (not realistic but one can dream).
---
Damnit Tybalt, pay attention - apple cider.
---
I love those purple sparkles. I wish there were a infusion with that effect!!
---
Thank you, I was just talking to someone on snowcrows discord and they said daredevil for staff and dragonhunter + soulbeast for GS 👌
---
How are you supposed to read the arcDPS buff window? the numbers in there make no sense to me.
---
Tybalt, about that apple cider
---
Ah don't worry about it. I'm sure we will get to share the cider one day.

If I remember well from the story mission, its blade was shattered but the flame was still glowing? And its said to have been a gift from the gods (alongside Sohothin). I guess it could be  reignited by any of the gods, but even then, I guess we could also have Aurene blow on it, knowing she absorbed some of Balth's powers at the end of PoF and I think she basically absorbed the rest after the last episode. So even if the flame has died, I think it could be manageable to reignite it.
---
Upvoted to lift your ego back up :)

Tybalt, that is enough

yup that works. Power Berserker is a pretty good build right now as well if you are into playing warrior. Reaper is also in a good place right now.

No point in engaging people like him. He has the all the time in the world for videogames, real world time has no value for him.

I personally just don’t understand the panic, it’s a cool mount with some novelty skills that can be pretty useful in the right context but I have a griffon right now and I find it easier to maneuver than the SS, I’d like to have the SS sure, don’t get my wrong, but it’s not going to make or break the game for me. It has no skins yet, it’s not impeding my progress on other parts of the game. It’s something that I just accept is going to be a long term goal and I’m cool with other people with dedication doing the legwork right now so when the time comes for me to do it, I have some resources.  I just don’t understand the people who are actively in distress about the time gated stuff to the point where they feel like they need to bring it up every time they touch their keyboards.
---
Thanks, I like to be as direct as possible.
---
Because unlike the rest, which we buy from a merchant who trained it (or that thing we did with the griffons), Skyscales are all dying, and we have to save their species as well as train them up to be mounts. I get it, but it does suck.
---
This made my skin itch.
---
The only people who know the droprates are developers, and they will never share that information with us.
---
The best the community can do is gather a huge dataset of drop results and use that to guess the droprates. That could happen, but there's no way in balls enough data is going to exist in the first week of release. Months later, maybe, and only if players actually decide to perform that kind of research in the first place.
---
What is stopping you from gw1?
---
You are a Champion of Dulfy
---
too soon
---
I don't know if this is entirely true. They can add the longest collection they can think of and someone will still play 20 hours straight to get it as fast as they can.
---
I'm not defending the sheer amount of time gates in this specific situation, I just feel there's no real way to win this argument from the development side. People will find something to complain about without giving constructive suggestions no matter what you do.
---
you use two swords as second set.
---
Pink butterflies? Ok....* scoots away* I think Necro would be more in line with what I have in mind. Thanks for all your help! :)
---
Outfits are content!? LOL
---
I don't have much time to play atm, I only finished the story yet. 
---
Thank you very much kind sir. :)
---
Yeah why should they care about the thing that keeps the company running 4Head
---
You may be like this, but don't fret, god loves each one of his little creatures.
---
Bloodstone Fen. Thankfully, it's in the name of the area, so hard to miss.
---
However, if you don't have it unlocked, I know there are other places but I can't remember which either.
---
Yes. You can actually try it out for free.
---
Princess helps, and the collection isn't as terrible now that we have mounts. (She's a Karka from the Lion's arch baby karka shooting thing that is a Dragonite Ore Gobbler.)
---
I mean, there's definitely more work to be done than just pressing a button. The collection was designed with the timegate in mind, so at the very least they have to revisit it. If it's removed it's not going to be an immediate change.
---
Personally, I think the charged quartz is fine.  I've always expected it to become valuable again and I never wanted to be caught by it's timegate.  So myself and friends made them daily.  I also do the same with several other timegate material items and have stockpiles of it all as do many other players.  So it doesn't affect us.  And if it did?  Then I'd happily pay the gold on the TP.  It's a lot less still than the griffin.
---
Monthly achievements were done by myself and most others I knew within 1 to 5 days.  And I was among many who are happy they were replaced.  I do not want them back.   I'm aware many people think they want them back, but if that happened, there would be many posts and complaints from others who don't want it.
---
If people enjoy grinding for super rare things like infusions, there are so non-stop ways already.  Besides the metas, you can constantly recreate characters for free keys and have a chance for a free key (super rare) from any kill.  And I personally don't consider content with only that (like the casino) to be replayable content.  It may well be for many who love rarity and infusions, but I'm among those who don't really care for it.  
---
So I appreciate if you think your ideas might help (and not solve) and they might for some players.  But it has no affect at all for many other players.
---
None of the collections but the last one seem to give anything, which kinda sucks, but I guess they did that with the griffon collections too. Still, it would have been a good incentive to balance the time-gating.
---
&gt;How unfortunate that the game has zero content besides the skyscale collection.
---
That *always* depends on who you talk to. Stop generalizing.
---
For someone like me who has dabbled with virtually everything and isn't a fan of achievement hunting, yes the collection is literally the only "content" that came with this patch. Calling it "content" is even a stretch for me since I'm not planning on getting it anytime soon as it's worthless for me who has all other mounts.
---
Took me 20 metas to drop my first one
---
She had to take a small break from content creation for the past few weeks because work required her full attention, but once her work project thing is over I imagine she'll be back.
---
I don't know if this will work, but try ask people in game to report your characters for inappropriate character name.
---
I know you have trouble to understand, don't worry
---
They focus on the players' money. That's a -huge- difference.
---
Yup, me too.
---
I 100% agree on the monthlies, but they should be harder than “Salvage 200 items” or “Kill 500 enemies”. Just saying
---
0.00023% from the “super rare” table...
---
Now ask the odds to hit the super rare loot table.. 
---
And pray for RNG
---
Who said you need a griffon?
---
The GW2 Zero Suit is far closer to what a skintight suit would look like on someone vs that weird spray painted male fantasy excuse for "armor." She literally looks like a ball-jointed doll.
---
What exactly do you think a 9 day timegate will accomplish? They have a 3-4 months cadence for new releases. So let's say e veryone does the skygate collection and are busy for 1-3hrs a day for 9-10 days. How is it gonna help, except maybe look good on some metrics? Who seriously believes people will be happy to come back to that map not because of the quality of the content itself, but because they were forced to run 5 laps around it pressing F? I see players still come back to HoT, and not because of the timegates.
---
Stop asking commonfolk to come up with ideas for professionals with years of expertise in their field of choice. It's not only a bad argument ("you're not a game developer therefore you don't get to express an opinion on their work"), it's also very patronising towards anet themselves. They don't need protection from the mean critiques. They can do better, they've done better in the past, they will do better in the future if we stop trying to excuse this (frustrating but all in all inconsequential) herpaderp. NOTE: I checked the step 3 collection on coffeemug's stream, and it's far better than the terrible 1st and 2nd, they didn't need to timegate it, seriously... but anyway.
---
 Another thing. This is a sub with thousands of people. There are probably tens of thousands of active people ingame. For the nth time, *it's not the same people complaining*. Of course there's a community, but it's not a blob of people with the same opinions. There are thousands of different complaints coming from different folks with many different goals and agendas. I'm unhappy with the raid balance, for example, but lots of people are perfectly happy about it. If they changed it, they'd potentially make me more satisfied, but anger someone else at the same time. You can't satisfy everyone, you just gotta try your very best and I suppose not piss off the majority.
---
They're not evil. They're not lazy. This time, though, mostly with the timegate and the first collection steps, they dun goofed and they did go the cheap and lazy way. They could've just run out of time, really. They're struggling, I don't blame them for trying to come up with ideas for mount skins and something to get the players to engage. The argument is simple: the collections (first few at least) are messy, bloated, repetitive and on top of that heavily timegated, some of which is hidden. The mount looks cheap and unpolished, almost rushed. I've seen them do better and I expect as much. it's also, rally, really, REALLY not cool to hype the mount up and then slap very robust collections on top of a timegate only beaten by Aurora, the legendary armors and that goddamn awful shitty backpack.
---
For some practical examples: beetle, griffon, all done better by GW2's team. The timegating was way milder, you could go at your own pace, it was a bit less repetitive.
---
GW1's team hit the nail on the head with all the élite mission zones, which are beautiful, challenging, rewarding and some of them were sorta open world raids so you could do quests and bosses at will without losing progress. I also like GW2 raids, though less. They're too straightforward at times. They. Can. Do. Better. They don't need me to help them come up with good ideas.
---
Why would they cut themselves of 1600 gems profit from you?
---
&gt;Time-Gated things should be used as a tool to allow casual players to catch up to the hardcore ones. 
---
That's called "Catch-Up Mechanics", not Time-Gated.
---
Time gating just makes everyone take the same amount of time to acquire something, no matter when they start it.
---
Oh I didn't mean "interesting" as a snarky version of "weird", just genuinely an interesting example of a different way they've done timegates. Most of the precursor/legendary collections are on the gold grind end of gating and the exceptions and how those were received are neat to compare with.
---
I love you!!  &lt;3
---
Copying from earlier comment:
---
&gt;Let's say there were 5 daily time gates (I think there's more but for simplicity's sake) and each daily collection would take 2 hours.
---
&gt;Person 1 plays 2 hours per day for 5 days = 10 hours. He would have the mount after 5 days
---
&gt;Person 2 normally plays the same 10 hours in one go on Saturday. Now he can only do "2 hours" of the collection during that day and has to wait until next week. Result: person 2 will only have the mount after 5 weeks.
---
&gt;Both people played the exact same number of hours but person 2 will need to wait 7 times longer in order to get the mount. All this because of an arbitrary limitation they're forcing on us.
---
So it seems that 5 days was a great underestimation. 5 weeks suddenly becomes 22 weeks for a person who can only play on Saturdays. That's 5.5 fucking months instead of whatever the collection would take if you could just do it at your own pace. That's not counting the other timegates, just the charged quartz
---
The point being, time gating may not seem a big deal for someone who can play daily but for those who can only do one long session per week it becomes an absolute disaster. Plus, artificially padding doesn't solve complaints about there being not enough content (which is a valid complaint), waiting isn't content.
---
lmao good work this was funny
---
I recommend using Sword/Sword. Sword/Focus as your 2nd in fractals &amp; GS as your second in open world.
---
Number 5 sword does pretty high damage. 
---
The page isn't working right now for me, but I think this is more-or-less the build I use and find it quite good: https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Chronomancer_-_Sword/x_Phantasms
---
Yes so what you do is you put sword 1 in your main hand and a shield on your off hand.
---
And on your swap you put a 2nd sword or focus (depending on the fight)  in your off hand.
---
Then when you’re done with raids you switch back to GS.
---
Honestly the amount of people just whinging and whining no matter what boggles the fucking mind. Like the same guildies who complain about having nothing to do in game at all are now mad that they cant just rush the content and go back to doing nothing and being bored.
---
That post hit as hard as a wet fart. You are quite possibly the most pathetic person I've argued with on reddit
---
I'd love to see the math of this after all its finished..I'm guessing skyscale cost will come closer to griffin..
---
Its a pun my man. First comment said costumers (people who make costumes) instead of customers.
---
Yeah, I mean, the entire thing takes a couple of minutes. it's definitely not the best story instance, but it's not that long that I think it'd detract from your interest in the game as a whole.
---
All nice and dandy but other than stop playing what exactly are you, as a plyer, able to do if they go insane?
---
Male light inquest pants say hello since launch.
---
&gt;Just because a piece of content does not interest you, does not mean that content does not exist
---
It doesn't exist *for me* because it's not **enjoyable** *for me*. Why would you do something that's not enjoyable in **a game** that you literally spend time in to **enjoy**? 
---
&gt;How much of an idiot do you have to be to actually believe that?
---
I guess you've relegated to name calling because you have no valid argument monkaS.
---
But right back at you I guess.
---
AND you also get to keep the “shared inventory slot” they come in too! (Which is a small cost savings as well)
---
If Chrono Trigger taught me anything it should cause an world level extinction event...
---
Unlocking the griffon is worth its weight in gold. If it was 1000 gold to unlock, it would still be worth it.
---
Well that picture on the right literally is a ball jointed doll/figure :p

Im glad ty

Watch at 30:00, and the dev will talk and show about Skyscale movement. Watch at 38:00, and the dev will talk and show about Skyscale masteries.
---
Basically, with Skyscale, you have access to rifts, which are basically like ley lines for Skyscale.
---
The last mastery is the most useful one, as you can jump up a little bit after clinging on a wall. You can use it to reach high places. It's slower than a springer, but you have more control, and it's useful for times when you can't find a ledge. Also, the climbing potential is higher than a Springer I think.
---
One interesting tidbit from the video I found is that you can aim like 30 degrees higher and lower with the skyscale, and it will follow that direction. Basically, you aim up with the dash mount skill, and you can get a little increase in height.
---
I like D/P and rifle for open world with all middle traits- swap to top grandmaster and top middle trait when against bosses
---
YESSS! As a real life Samus cosplayer this makes me so happy. Fantastic job!

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11mrKXGJ6ZhzBXnpLKFOxv8ti1m28jY5qVfIl0TLDnF0/edit?usp=sharing
---
Medium armor is almost identical, but the other two WvW armor types cost significantly more than their crafted counterparts. On top of this, you must spend anywhere from eight to 24 hours grinding for Skirmish Claim Tickets.
---
DO NOT "stat swap" your armor to "save on crafting costs". The only components differing from one prefix to the next ARE the difference in cost, and if you stat swap you will have to craft BOTH. Just buy Zojja's and stick with it. If you find yourself needing a second armor set with a different prefix (Viper), it's more efficient to stat swap, because you're not spending laurels. This is the only exception.
---
Specialization Collections are actually a fantastic way to get specialization-specific ascended weapons in Path of Fire ONLY. HoT will force you to grind and spend more than simple crafting can afford.
---
Yeah all of mesmer skills are a shade of pink or purple. Necromancer skills are more dark green or black.
---
Charged quartz crystal prices are soaring. They were never very low. They should have made the food out of Eyes of Kormir and/or Congealed Putrescences that most of us have too many of, and no way to dispose of them.  
---
We still don't know what's behind the final two locked doors to finish these.
---
The torch in chaos is not a bug but intended. They implemented that a few patches ago.
---
Thank you for the link o/
---
There’s definitely different ways to go about it, but the amount of backtracking required to do something like that would be much slower which is why I’ve gone with routing it the way I have!

Flameseeker Prophecies is the coolest legendary. Change my mind.

That wasn't flying. That's falling with style!

Imagine using your Skyscale to go up a cliff just to use the Griffon. *

I'm not sure what build of Renegade you run, but does the number make sense to you? Does it seem like you have over 100% up time? If it sounds about right then it should be right.   
---
And yes I did mean average of 23 stacks of might in my example, 25 was a typo. Again, not sure with what build of Ren you're running, but 9 stacks of might self generated may be what your build expects.
---
Everytime I scroll past this on my front page I start cracking up. This shit is hilarious lmao
---
The experience of the skyscale collection is:
---
1. Collect things from all across the game.
---
2. Wait to proceed until ANet's server clock reaches a certain time.
---
The first step is not in any way instant (it's actual content), and the second step adds nothing whatsoever to the experience. In a way, the timer encourages rushing through the actual experience and getting everything as instantly as possible, because if going at your own pace means you miss the server reset, you're behind a full 24 hours. So players are highly incentivised to not actually do the content at their own pace, but rush through it before another timer locks them out of further participating in and progressing the collection.
---
People liked the beetle collection a lot - it wasn't instant, you had to finish the story and collect several things to earn it, but even if the collection had been 20 layers deep, any player was free to go through it at their own pace, without the looming thought of missing a specific time of day by 30 seconds hanging over the entire process, urging them to finish now or be punished for it.
---
A timer is quite literally the laziest possible way to pad and stretch out content, because there's nothing there to "experience gradually" except for watching a clock.
---
I still want them to add it in as a legendary weapon. Even if it is inconsistent with the pattern. The sword is just too damn cool.
---
Mirage has STUPID mobility and utility. Blink, Jaunt, Mirage Thrust are all mobility plus stunbreak, cleanse, CC respectively. And that gives you two more utility slots, an offhand, and a weapon swap of your choosing. I have a hard time playing my Thief now, Mirage has spoiled me.
---
This is really well made, I almost expected to see my post get pulled out of those streamers as well lol.
---
We know that it will almost certainly come with the next raid wing, whoever that is.
---
If they don't want enemies to drop loot, don't spawn enemies. It's a really bad experience to have the entire rest of the game train you that mobs drop loot/xp/can be rallied off, and then don't do that in a bunch of circumstances.
---
Their branding happened after sometime after Kralkatorrik flew south, which means it was after Kralkatorrik went to kill Glint.
---
The egg could have been before their branding, or after their branding if it was Vlast.
---
Oh yea, the ring right? But i assume there must be one for ls4 aswell don't you think?
---
Seems that the Skyscale is the big LS4 collection.  
---
Next trinket should come with the next raid release (ring).
---
The problem is that we can talk for hours about content and how they should design it, but a lot of time complaints boil down to wanting the carrot. 
---
They got the carrot too easily, and want other carrots now, or the carrot requires too much effort and how does the game dare not giving them immediately their dopamine shot?
---
I see, no reason collecting all materials then haha:)
---
Time gating content does not mean the content magically becomes more.
---
Same here I stopped playing for 6 months after crafting the juggernaut.. farming really bores me and makes me reconsider if all the time spent on it is worth the result
---
yeah i mean all i can say is 250 gold
---
Glad to hear it! Thanks for the feedback as well :)
---
Yeah. Fighting a mesmer is like fighting a crowd of nineties music video backing dancers who want you dead but won't compromise their artistic integrity.
---
Yeah, the time gate was done for investors and not for the players. More "players engagement" and more "daily logins" to show the investors. 
---
That shit needs to stay out of video game design.
---
Good write up, but i would argue about the B group and how much extra player engagement does having something to click once a day for 3/20 days create? 
---
If they have other goals = they were gonna play anyway = so this new time gate doesnt increase their playtime (except minutes)?
---
The goal of the time gated content is to get you to start the game and do a "thing" and while you are doing it you also might do something else. Think like dailys/world quests in wow. Aight time to do my dailies and on the way to the quest you might see some other quests/content and do those on the way/while you are there. 
---
A clickable thing in your inventory doesnt lead you towards any other content. Its in a void in your inventory. It doesnt interact with any other mechanics of the game.
---
Now if the time gate was more like, you have to gather 200 nodes of some new thingamabob in the new map and you can collect only 20/40/etc a day. This might lead you to also occationally do other content on the map when it catches your eye. (not saying i necessarily want this, but just an example). Now that type of timegating might increase retention on both groups. 
---
Cuz there is a chance that even the people who are only after the mount. They might stumble upon something cool and they might check it out. Ooh whats this event? i wonder if theres a ach for this. Might as well do it while im here. Oh it continues... aaand you have played for longer than you planned to.
---
If anything, most people use ReShade.  You could also try d912pxy to see if it gives you better performance.  Here is a thread on getting everything to work together: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bd09qu/arcdps_gw2_radial_reshade_and_d912pxy/
---
First w7 to finish the ring. Next will come with season 5. We also have datamined waterbreather a backpiece and ammulet i believe it was. I imagine back will come from raids as well unless they plan on adding something different because we have all this ld from w5 and 6 and nothing to use it on
---
anyone else remember when ANet said shortly after the one path ends release that they have plans for a whole set? good times.
---
was expecting a trinket as well, OP. as aemius already said though, it seems like the skyclaw is supposed to be the equivalent for this season. don't throw away your materials just yet... there is a grim chance you might still need them...
---
I'll gladly give my jackal. I don't think I've ever used him once since I got it.
---
Probably similar to droprate of Tequatl's Hoard and Triple Trouble equipment
---
Then its a good thing I never said that.
---
Shared slots also work.

I think after episode 3 or 4 they mentioned in an AMA that they plan to have a full set of legendary trinkets released with season 4 (1 trinket of each kind). So we got aurora already and the ring from the next raid. Maybe they release the third one, related to all season 4 episodes with the ring or a little after that to stretch it out a bit.
---
Good, I'm glad it was helpful
---
 It depends on what region you're in. So say you have everything; HoT and PoF. Core Tyria is included in the base game so that's a given.
---
If you've done all masteries in Core Tyria but you're in HoT and haven't completed its masteries, you won't earn shards while in HoT. Vice versa and the same thing applies in PoF and vice versa there too.
---
Do you know what resolution they are playing at?
---
I have almost the exact same rig (8700k instead) and don't dip below 30, but only play at 1080p as it is hooked up to our big TV.
---
When you hit HoT, the difficulty ramps up *significantly*. The story improves too, and the mechanics.
---
Didn’t you cosplay Samus too?  I remember reading an article or something posted on here years ago (2014?) about using a 3D printer for a lot of it.
---
Told you 6 months ago, gonna tell you again now. Having more account value than 99% of all registered players does not equal being "rank 1". Sad to see you still didn't learn how % works.
---
I agree, except during bunker metas like this one or the Chrono bunker meta. Then it is just straight up not a good time.

I love the hovering in midair. No, your horizontal flight speed isn't great. But being able to achieve true vertical flight and stay up indefinitely and effortlessly is kinda nice. I hate the time gates but I still want the mount for my use. The number of times I've been flying on the Griffon and wished it was the Skyscale reassure me that it's worth getting if I can.
---
Am I the only one who thinks he looks like Nick Cage?
---
Careful, they'll nerf the Griffon to make the Skyscale more "appealing"
---
It's not going to fill the whole day, but it's an incentive to log in, and just getting people to log in regularly gets them to do more shit in general.
---
Since we have access to Sohothin replicas through the Hall of Monuments (Fiery Dragon Swords), it's be awesome to have at least access to Magdaer replicas. Sure there's the Jormag's Breath that is similar, if not exactly the same, in design, but even that one burns "shorter" than the Fiery Dragon Sword. Yeah Magdaer as a legendary would be awesome. It might be inconsistent with the current legendary pattern, but if I remember well, Exordium is the last of gen2 legendaries. Maybe a new pattern might arise! (Probably but heh, optimism 101).
---
The Skyscale seems to have replaced it, instead of having another accessory.
---
It also looks like missing skins got unlocked. I've opened one box before, got one skin, but now all 3 are showing as unlocked.
---
This, I like.

Monthly achievements needs to come back indeed, but maybe as a guild thing, it would be great, like "Kill 5000 branded creatures" and any member of the guild can participate just playing the game. Add enough goals and it would both revitalize guilds and monthlys.

I'd like to have long term repeating achievements back too, but I'd rather have them back in the form of quarterly achievements instead.
---
A month is too short for enough people to do a lot of different meaningful tasks if you consider those who can play only on a few days per week. I'd be unfair to leave out people just because that have a busy week.  
---
So with monthly achievements we'd be limited to boring "Kill 1000 rats" grindy stuff that a few would get done in a few days.
---
With a quarterly cycle, we could have much more varied achievements about participating in a great variety of different specific tasks rather than repetitive ones. Participating in PvP and WvW seasons, completing every single dungeon and fractal path, fighting every world boss, completing specific meta-events, fight some raid bosses, win matches in different arenas, replaying story chapters, capture and defend different locations in WvW, etc.   
---
That way we'd people to do all sort of things across the game quarterly, and counter a bit how people tend to naturally flock to the latest or most profitable content. And of course give neat rewards in the process.
---
Its quite possible they might be holding off on it as something to do in-between season 4 and 5.  But we are still waiting on finishing the ring too.
---
\[Daily Mystic Forger\]
---
I thought you could use (4) blue or (4) green unid's for this quest.  Matter if fact, I've done it.  But now, when I press 'F' to use the Mystic Forge, in the inventory selection to the left of the forge screen, I can't get unid's to show.  It's like it will only show me a small portion of my inventory.
---
Has something changed?
---
I'm saving them too just in case. Doing map completion on multiple alts while doing events and gathering motes is a great way to accrue them.
---
skyscale will sure have its share, knowing that the collection unfinished yet.
---
I just recently found out that I need to purchase the rest of LWs4 to get a Skyscale.  I won't be.  I'm actually so turned off now, I may never purchase gems again either.  I spent hours directly after the patch went live, working toward the Skyscale collections.  What an insult.  Why not just sell the stupid mount then?
---
Gentleman right here \^  
---
I'm all bout the auto-run life now
---
The only part of it that's timegated doesn't take 5 hours a day to complete.
---
You can take your time on all of it, and  log in for 5 minutes to feed the pet and log back out and go about your lives when you get to that part. If you can't spend 5 hours a day, then dont! Takes maybe an hour for each part of the first collection. Second "day" collection can be broken down into chunks and tackled a little bit at a time. At no point are you rushed to complete it all in a certain amount of time.
---
&gt; I love tiebreakers
---
GW1 had the best tiebreaker. If the score was even, blue team won. Fucking Kurzicks..
---
Genuine interest: in the GW2/Skyscale context, what would these "catch up mechanics" look like?
---
[Yes!](https://imgur.com/gallery/EjgBC)
---
From personal experience, there is not much you can do to speed up the process but what you can do is make it a little more enjoyable, collections tell a story about the weapon and it's nice to think of it through every single item you collect!
---
Aquatic Ruins tops out at 76; 107AR. Unless they do a heavy shuffle, yeah, I'd skip completely (unless you *really* need the stats).

Specifically:  Make food by Combining 25 Bloodstone Dust, 5 Globs of Ectoplasm, 2 Slabs of Red Meat, and 1 Charged Quartz Crystal to make the Skyscale Food. You'll need 12 of these — you can buy from the TP or get the total 300 Bloodstone, 60 Ecto, 24 Red Meat, and 12 Charged Quartz. You can only feed them 3 times per day - so you'll need an additional 4 days to complete this part.

I would think of either lowering the amount required, or increasing the amount a food/interaction is worth.
---
WoW did something similar with Artifact Knowledge - you could research bigger multipliers on the AK. Let's say it took one week to go from 1.5x -&gt; 2x. But if you came in later and researched it later, you would only take, say, 3 days instead of a week to increase the multiplier.
---
&gt; general consensus seems to be that it's much more reasonable.
---
Maybe now, people sure as shit weren't happy about it when it was released. Realistically 5 daily lock outs are upfront annoying but most people will be done with the thing before even a standard 1-2 week patch cycle would fix it. Most people will likely have forgotten the whole thing in a couple months.
---
Wow that looks awesome :O As you may can tell from my name, im kind of an metroid fan too! Would love to see that in real life some time, good job!

Now im off too making that cosplay ingame lol

If you want a response from Anet maybe post on the official forums. You might have better luck there.

Bountiful valleys and thickly forested tracts of land.
---
Thanks so much! :D
---
It's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen in GW 2 and there's plenty to choose from.
---
This is a mount. Not a legendary.
---
A CHOICE would have been far better for this mount. To pay either gold or do a collection and pay no gold. Not catering to one group of players or the other. I could make 250 gold in less time and nonsense than this. Then there are players that don't have gold or don't want to spend gold and want that extended experience. This collection is great for them. The choice is what would have made this more exciting and creative.
---
Instead, they decided to give no choice in how to get the mount and stuck it behind time-gates that delay both options. Why? To extend already hollow and scarce content. There are better ways to output rich, quality, lasting content in a decent time-frame that players have pointed out. This is not one of them.
---
&gt;  I think she basically absorbed the rest after the last episode.
---
did she though?  i got the opposite impression from the dialogue/scenes.
---
Nah, let him have the skimmer. The jackal at least has decent skins.
---
Imagine you only have the occasion to play in the weekend, for whatever reason.  You so the collections calmly and you almost finish the first set on saturday. Then, on sunday, you want to make progress similar to what you did on saturday. You start by finding the last 3 eggs you left over yesterday, but then, when you want to continue, you can't. Because the game literally won't allow you to more, until you wait another day.
---
Yeah, I meant it like...it's a *good* increase in difficulty, it encourages you to learn your class properly but it's rewarding to play. Path of Fire is a bit less difficult but compared to core and LS2 gameplay, it's much more entertaining to play. Some of the boss fights have some really cool mechanics.
---
It's literally what I was saying in the beginning. It baffles me why you had to push it.
---
They should have done it Aurora, where you have to go to all 6 LS maps to actually do things (not press F), then collect a stack of the map-speciric mats (like difluorite and mistonium) to purchase it.
---
It would still be time-gated, as you have to wait for events and such, but it could be done in a day. It makes all the maps more populated again and fills the gap between releases. And the players who have already grinded enough to stockpile the map-specific mats wouldn't be forced to grind and wait even longer, they'd be rewarded for their loyalty to season 4.
---
Episode 5 came out 4 months ago.  Spoilers on that are fair game to openly discuss at this point, sorry not sorry.
---
Just remember the lamps are 1 a day crafts too, so craft them ahead even if you're waiting to sell.
---
Not a spoiler. Aurene was killed last episode, which was a couple months ago.
---
&gt; Medium armor is almost identical, but the other two WvW armor types cost significantly more than their crafted counterparts. **On top of this, you must spend anywhere from eight to 24 hours grinding for Skirmish Claim Tickets.**
---
as I stated in my response to you; if you play the game-modes, it's not a grind; in PvP you don't need the gear to participate and in WvW you can get by with Exotics for most of the content (no AR requirements) so if you _play_ the game mode; you'll have the currency.
---
&gt; If you find yourself needing a second armor set with a different prefix (Viper), it's more efficient to stat swap, because you're not spending laurels. This is the only exception.
---
That's what I was referring to in my comment when I said:
---
&gt; Don't craft what you need, craft what you can then change it. (**this is more for condition and support builds (Viper's, Minstrel, trailblazer**))
---
Fulgurite is also an annoying grind if you're new to the game.
---
&gt; Don't @me without doing the math.

You know these posts are kinda silly lol. It's like watching a recap before a new episode of a show without having actually seen the previous episodes then complaining about spoilers.
---
*SPOILER HYSTERIA INTENSIFIES*
---
That's exactly what's happening though? You do get access to a limited version of the skyscale by playing the story and the map. It's limited in that you don't have the masteries and that you'll have to find a new one when you dismount. And you do get to experience some of the new content with it. The story straight up tells you to fly up to the wing using that limited skyscale, and it certainly helps with some of the skyscale achievements. (I don't think you can get the scale above the pact encampment with just a springer, I'm pretty sure you need the skyscale or perhaps the griffon for that.)
---
It's obviously not as good as having the actual unlocked mount but that's the whole point of even having a limited version: having something to look forward to.
---
Ffs the timegate is not that bad
---
And yeah, three or four (or more?) in-game years ago, when the Asura personal story is happening, I definitely got more of a pawn than member or leader vibe. But that's when Kudu was still alive and running Inquest. A lot has happened since then.
---
The way I see it: in the last mission inside Kralk, he says that the other magics help her (forgot the exact word) instead of tormenting her, that she is the first of her kind. So when we yeet our spear into Kralk's heart, Aurene basically absorbs the energy of Kralk who has inside him Zaithan magic, Mordremoth magic and Balthazar magic. 
---
I think she absorbed it all but it didn't "change" her, I think she will simply have more "tools" without the side effects Kralk had. A bit in the way  MegaMan absorbs boss powers.
---
But I guess we'll see how she manages that energy in future content!
---
If it was your ISP there's little chance of it happening again. Traffic obstructing routing problems are high grade issues at an ISP (I know, I work for one) but are usually the result of an infrastructure upgrade where not everything migrated smoothly. Thus should be a rare event. Hopefully anyway.
---
While your Mesmer won't be using greatsword in raids, it's basically required for open world content as it's the only viable ranged weapon for tagging mobs that Mesmer has. Even condi-mirage has to use greatsword since staff is to unreliable for tags and scepter only hits one enemy.
---
We can only hope.. I was so bummed at having to re-download everything gosh. Relief!

---
Speak for yourself, the more I use the Skyscale in Dragonfall the more I'm figuring it out, enjoying it, and noticing it filling issues I've had with the griffon (which are basically the pros/cons between a plane and helicopter).
---
You will get teleported out if it's not allowed, like with mesmer portals.
---
Tekkit has a video showcasing the Skyscale and he mentioned he once managed to stick to the ceiling. This will be my new endgame goal.
---
blue bags can drop exos, so id assume they can drop precursors too
---
So I'm an idiot for not calling it content because it's not fun for me? **And that I do an activity that's not fun for me in a game that should* be for my own enjoyment?**
---
Looks like pot calling the kettle black here.
---
 ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
If I put you in a fight with default skins and prevented you from seeing your gear, how could you tell if you had a legendary or or an ascended?
---
But this looks like such a minor thing that maybe a single person can fix this in an hour or less. Maybe even in 10-20 min? My idea with this post was something like... "Hey, maybe one person from Anet can notice this. Maybe they'll be generous enough to fix this." It isn't adding even adding something new to the game.
---
My guess would be its tye Shatterer, who dies fly around those maps . But if not...screenshot?

Yeah you can. do the first part to unlock the map.  Buy the scroll, put scroll into Shared Inventory slot, profit.

I'm not sure how time-gating leads to more monetization.

We already know what the masteries are, which is why the skyscale will be used way more than the bunny once maxed.

---
3rd mastery completely breaks this mount as u can climb almost non-stop. 
---
A lot of people compare skyscale with griffon (because flying) even though they have completely different purposes. Griffon is about speed, scyscale is about climbing. Scyscale is a hybrid, it trades speed for utility,  u can fly long distances and climb (higher than bunny) but at the cost of speed. It's a pretty fair trade off. Weather it will be used or not depends solely on how the maps work and.
---
Personally i hate the bunny cause i dont like how it looks, the animations, anything from it which is why ill use this instead after i acquire it. Griffon on the other hand is way too good at what it does so will still remain the best mount for me.,
---
In blazeridge steps you can see shatterer hanging around. It wasn't kralk as at this point in time, he's in elona.
---
I imagine you could just hold it into Sohothin's blade to re-ignite it. It's at least worth a try.
---
From Bitter Harvest mission
---
&lt;Character name&gt;: We're here. This thing. This tree, must be the dragon's epicenter.
---
Canach: Yes, I feel Mordremoth's eyes bearing down upon me.
---
Braham Eirsson: Where is the beast? I want to meet eyes with the jungle overlord.
---
Canach: It's not one thing out here, Braham. It's everything!
---
Canach: The entire time we were traversing this jungle, we were afoot on its back. Like fleas on a hound.
---
Braham Eirsson: If that's the case, then... Aaaarrrgghhh!
---
From Hearts and Minds:
---
Trahearne: It's too late. I know—I am part of the jungle dragon now. It is everywhere.
---
Braham: So how do we kill it? Burn every field and fell every forest?
---
Trahearne: No...it can't be defeated that way. It'll just grow back. Its roots have spread too far, too deep.
---
&lt;Character name&gt;: Then we destroy the root: Mordremoth's mind. Its strongest attacks come from its mind, from the Dream. That's our target.
---
And the fact that we explicitly fight the *Mouth* of Mordremoth tells us that this isn't Him in His entirety, but just a part of Him.
---
Do I think the skyscale should have been time gated? Nope.
---
But do I make dozens of OUTRAGED posts declaring how unacceptable this is that I can't get the skyscale on day 1? Nope.
---
Do I simply go play parts of the new content that I enjoy like a rational balanced human being? Yep.
---
People on this sub and gamers in general just get off on rightful indignation over trivial bullshit. So much whining it's unreal.
---
[Sure, here you go.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jph_VQuvZ0w)  Keep in mind that this was like...the day after PoF released.  Most people didn't even know there was a griffon, much less what it could do when fully mastered.  People were just starting to realize what a grind it was to get the mount, and there was some initial pushback.  Then this vid got posted, and our minds were kind of collectively blown.
---
Yup.  The timegate is excessive but there's definitely a niche for the the Skyscale in the game, though I would've liked the Skyscale to look a bit different from the Griffon, some of their animations look really similar.  There are a lot of animals that aren't dragons that can hover, like bees, hummingbirds, etc.  I know the skimmer got a hummingbird skin but cmon.  
---
I'm saying I would've really liked a giant bumblebee mount.  A lot.
---
Man, wish I knew.
---
&gt;The new meta has what I consider a great approach with the keys to the mistborn coffers. It rewards those who help push the meta forward in the camp building phase and isn't just a "show up at XX:30 to do just the final part while getting all of the same loot as someone who pushed camps"  
---
I hadn't even realized this, but holy shit you're 100% right and it's an amazing solution

---
&gt; he says that the other magics help her (forgot the exact word) instead of tormenting her, that she is the first of her kind. 
---
ahh, ok.  i missed the line about them not tearing her apart.
---
I am happy there's a timegate.
---
I totally understand why people don't like them, but personally, I am really enjoying this collection for two reasons: it's really long and involved (which gives me something specific to invest my time in/be interested in *and* a great feeling of accomplishment once I get done) and there's timegates that prevent me from feeling obligated to sit here and grind endlessly, because I know that I *will* if I *can* and that's just not healthy. (It also has the effect of prolonging the fun of the quest -- which I *could* do even without the timegate, sure, but I know myself well enough to know that I won't. It's like reading a really enjoyable book all in one sitting -- once I get excited about something, I'll get really into it and then later regret that I finished it so quickly.)
---
Right now, each leg of the quest is involved enough to keep me interested, but the timegating frees me up to do other things without FOMO. I am honestly excited to log in each day to continue my big quest, and that's something I haven't been able to say for a long time! 
---
That's my personal feelings on it, anyway. I understand others don't necessarily agree, but those of us who like timegates *do* exist... and, really, I think at least  a few more people would feel the same as me if more people were honest with themselves about how they play *without* timegated content (aka if you know you're the type who would sit in front of the computer for a 20-hour long stretch just to grind out new content ASAP -- and a lot of people here would, I bet -- you should probably admit that timegating is good for you, and feels *better* in the long run).
---
Thank you so much!! This is the exact insight I wanted. The colors turned out beautifully too, and i'm a purple/pink girl but the blue to orange metallic shift is amazing, almost like how cars shift colors in light. You did an amazing job, and honestly people comparing it to the shining blade isn't bad, because lots of us want multiple weapons together!
---
right, but at the end they didn't know what would happen since kralk died, and the implication was because the magic wasn't absorbed.
---
plus kralk went crazy and such because of all the different magic he absorbed, so it sounded like aurene didn't take all of it in order to avoid that same fate.
---
You're ignoring the fact that the gear itself gives you _completely different ways to interact with the game's gearing system, which counts as part of the game mechanics and overall gameplay._  Please, read the link I sent you.  
---
Whether or not it was default skins or you preventing me from seeing my gear is irrelevant because you're essentially just eliminating an entire section of the game in an attempt to prove your point. You can't just cut out a section of the game that doesn't agree with your argument.  The fact is that gear choice _does_ effect gameplay and the ability to change those choices on the go _results in different ways to interact with the game and implement different strategies both of which are fundamental aspects of gameplay._

I got one on my first meta and I haven't opened it yet, i can't decide on which one I want.  The staff, shield, torch, or maybe scepter are the ones I'm leaning towards but I have the Bifrost,and dont use those other weapons very much 😐
---
No way this is not bait.
---
Isn't it like 4 days? I'll agree it's a bit much if the final parts of the collection are extreme, but there's nothing wrong with it taking 4 days to get a mount.
---
Theres so much to look at in the instance, its easily missable :3. Also if you redo it again, there's one of Kralk's torment phases where he has pinkish kawaii cheeks. Takes away every ounce of menace from him hahah
---
I figured it out.  Go to Siren and just go to here area.  Then to revive ppl I with to Brisban and at Triforge wp and rezzed the dead npc's there.  Worked.
---
It stand for the Potato Cat. As a friend I can state that it fits her perfectly. She’ll kill me later for this
---
Thank you! I still have to get started on the sick skyscale collection, so I'll definitely use this as a guide.
---
F
---
Thanks! This helps me a lot, and I want to be convinced. After all, Canach does say "we were afoot on its back" -- that sounds pretty clear. But how can the entire jungle really the back of one big dragon? Or does he no longer have the shape of a dragon, instead being a shapeless being whose only coherence is maintained by his mind? If so, this would point more to a mental equivalence between the dragon and the jungle. Anyway, it's strange to me, this gray area between literal and figurative meaning, but your help is appreciated!
---
You don't actually need to fight them though.
---
You just need to spawn them, which I actually did solo last night. It's not hard. Kill 8 vets.
---
Obviously. When I say "and then do it," I don't mean "today." I mean that they should commit to it publicly, then begin the process of removing it, with high priority.

---
Screenshot doesn't do it justice. The delivery is awesome.
---
If the final skyscale flies like the rented ones do then I can't imagine players using them much except to get to those high spots.
---
quality content
---
For champions, Mirage can be pretty solid. It has great damage and a lot of evasions. 
---
However, for weaker enemies, Chrono is better due to the high burst of their abilities.
---
Personally, I still do higher dps on Champions with my power Chrono as well. That said, I'd do sword/sword + greatsword. Utility = Phantasmal Defender, Phantasmal Disenchanter and I use well of action.
---
250 gold is nothing in this game now, I'd rather pay that than have the timegates.

The section you're cutting out actually is gameplay, by the agreed upon definition, which I linked in my article.  Any interaction with the game constitutes gameplay. If you took all gear and itemization out of GW2, you would have a drastically different game.
---
Yea shh Jesus
---
Housing. Make content drop stuff to put into your house (doesn't actually have to be a house, can also be something like a skyship or whatever fits with GW2) or make them craftable (with reasonable ressources).
---
Maybe at the time, but now I suspect they have the tech now. Pistol isn’t a weapon with a tremendous range of animations anyway.
---
This
---
They're like animals, and I slaughtered them like animals. I ... oh wait wrong franchise
---
Three collections in the same place would be fine by me (ie the overall length wasn't bad) *except* that you have to do the collections *before* the time gate. They do this so much I guess it's probably deliberate, but I'd enjoy the opposite a lot more. A time gate would help me pace collections like these, as I'd say "okay I have 6 days left to get X number of items."
---
Thank you so much! &lt;3
---
I'll rate this post after the daily reset.
---
mesmer uses GS for ranged deimos
---
I planned to ignore this legendary, but after seeing this clip I know my guardian really needs it! Now!
---

Upvote for the up/down vote icons on the chute meter.
---
It looks like it's trying to turn into something during warrior #5 but then it doesn't
---
Yes, it's exposing the hardcore and the casual players of the game, ultimately dividing the community on whether the skyscale is worth it or not. The hardcore people that enjoy this kind of grind have lots of gold &amp; time, they convert gold to gems. The casuals that do not enjoy the grind will not be buying mount skins / micro transactions for a mount they don't have. They will simply move along to other games after doing the free episode story and come back later for another free game update. I don't see why Arenanet bothers with time gating, we don't pay monthly subs. They make money from people spending gems on the store, not from people taking longer to do things in game so they pay more sub fees.
---
Wow! That's quality legendary weapon design!
---
It's the wording with what you said. The collection isn't really grindy, its just timegated, unless you consider waiting around fiddling with your thumbs "grind".
---
once got my account back and reset to a date when i last logged in. pretty nice cause i had lost all asc gear
---
None of that will come to pass.
---
I repeatedly say this, Silverwastes should have been the model for meta maps going forward.
---
It's written on exotic at the bottom: "This weapon is used to craft the legendary XX".
---
There are four that I’m aware of:
---
1) Take the north past from the starting area and you’ll see it on the other side of the tail
---
2) Take the south path from the starting area towards the Warden camp and you’ll come across it
---
3) At the south part of the map between the two camps is another bridge
---
4) North of the SW camp is another bridge as you make your way towards the NW camp
---
There are a couple of bridges which have a chance to spawn two type of events. One where you repair it with salvaged scraps and the other where you defend it against enemies. These events seem to spawn randomly or when the meta just starts. My most efficient way to find the bridge events is to park multiple characters at different bridges and then just log them in one by one to see if the event is up
---
Wohhhh.
---
Jahai Bluffs is arguably the best LS map they've done. And they released it within their 3 month window.
---
Oh my god, that mouse click touch on the skill killed me, that's brilliant!
---
I've been meaning to set up my steam controller for gw2, but I've been having too much fun with the game itself lol. Watching what you did here has convinced me to continue screwing around with steam input and in-home streaming, thank you. :D
---
My bad.
---
thanks
---
They’ve changed the personal story so the Arah part is now in a soloable instance.
---
I made the longbow on the first day because I waited years for it and had everything prepared. I hated it from the minute I saw it. 
---
Now there is a legendary that I really like and that I will probably craft in a few weeks... but why was the longbow such a letdown and the greatsword is amazing? Feels like a kick right into the crown jewels.
---
Sorry about wording, I speak 3 languages. And it's not just waiting around fiddling with your thumbs waiting for the timewall to go down. You have to go around maps finish collection, go do stuff, wait for stuff, wait for more stuff, and the rest to be determined. People compare it to legendary grind for a reason.
---
Same here both look really good but the zero suit matches so closely
---
It's a story patch, it's meant to provide info about story (both new and old). 
---
You had 4 months to unlock and play all LS4 episodes.
---
There's literally 0 value in these or any other living story patch notes if you're not interested in story. Even blacklion chest/general gemstore content is presented in separate posts.
---
Take a look!
---
&gt; I think timegating content doesnt get players (specially new ones) playing more. Its just another thing to do for the already existing players who would be online anyway and it infact loses new players when they hit that artificial wall.
---
The goal is definitely player retention, but you're right timegates like this have the opposite effect, certainly on me, I doubt I'll ever bother to get the skyscale, and if riding the rented skyscale is any indication its not even worth it anyway.
---
it will be the go to mount to afk (midair)
---
what if most folks dont wanna wait a week to get a mount. what if folks had a few days off during update and wanted to burn the mount out and have it ready for their idle time later on instead of being forced to play the game asap to make sure the hit the deadline of the daily resets?  
---
as for the 6 week thing. if youve never played fornite the way it works is there is a progress bar. we know its a skin for the game that that is the only way obtainable. we dont know what the skin is jsut that its a skin. then about 2 weeks out the devs start hinting at it. a week till they do a full reveal. if you have everything youll get it at the end of the 6th week for all your stuff completed. 
---
now as for the hatcing your own egg. easy way to fix the timegate stuff. and keep it role playing possible. you do all this egg stuff without the fucking time gate bs. from there maybe a mature skyscale seees the work we are putting in and comes to respect us and becomes tamed by us BAM no need for timegate and we get our mounts. nothing else changes, no on is on here bitching about timegates, game stays perfectly fine.
---
A “Time-Gated things should be used as a tool to allow casual players to catch up to the hardcore ones.”
---
B “These daily time-gates just make the casuals fall further behind, if anything.”
---
I don’t understand how A and B can both be true.  This is very confusing.
---
Just look at fractals. Fractal God takes a really long time. Yes, it is technically time gated because the bulk of your relics come from dailies. However, if you really wanted to, you could just complete fractals outside the daily. 
---
Moreover, there isnt really a super big reason to rush to FG. Sure, you get more rewards per fractal god tier. However, they arent binary like the mount (where you either have it or you have nothing).
---
Lastly, the step-wise climb is slow, but actually gives a reward beyond title. You get more gear per tier, deal more DPS per tier, etc. Not to mention the titles you do get are worth salt since each one shows you have really gotten a handle on that game mode, leading up to FG, which is a big achi as far as GW2 goes.
---
(And, FG actually costs a lot of gold, especially lost potential gold...but it almost doesnt matter because the lost gold "feels" like a worthwhile forbearance.)
---
I dont see why they cant do something like this for world boss or whatever. A very slow grind up. Each boss gives you some little bit of progress, but you also have to give up something fairly valuable to keep climbing. But each tier you get something nice--not OP, but nice--and at the end you have a really nice/difficult to achieve title and nice (again, not OP) account-wide boost that will differentiate you from someone who literally booted up the game for the first time 10 mins ago.
---
The feedback on the griffon was less strident than on the skyscale.
---
Did some snooping and it looks like the email I used for guild wars is popping up as compromised online.
---
I added that into my support ticket so I'm hoping for the best.
---
There are a few custom effects for  some skills though but yes, an aura would be great.
---
[This](https://i.imgur.com/h6ppMSZ.png) is what she looks like now
---
Shout out to the west coast, who all start playing after school/work and by that time the daily reset is already done.  :)
---
That's a good point. Personally I want to go through the quest at my pace, like here the Skyscale is meant to take a few days but I get through it in a single day. I feel like I void my right to complain on "The amount of content." and say things like:
---
"There's nothing to do."
---
At that point that's on me because I chose to consume it that quickly. Of course not everyone is going to see it that way and will expect Arenanet to have unlimited content.
---
As long as i can just get my characters back ill be happy.
---
&gt; Most of the event mobs don't give exp or drop loot, while nearly every mob in LS3/LS4 zones give exp and loot from events. 
---
they stopped that cuz ppl start farm event mobs instead of finishing the meta, like what happened in the thunderhead keep meta
---
Your math pretends air doesn't exist, they definitely didn't hit those speeds.
---
I mainly want a draw animation and aura. Custom effects wouldn't do much for Meteorlogicus tbh
---
&gt;I think it needs a bunch of adjustments. Bridge defense events end almost immediately, yet there's a daily AND achievement for 25 of them. Most of the veterans are annoying to get to super up high, and end almost immediately(I can kill all the mobs + vet in less than 10 seconds solo as power builds).
---
i did this achive in like 2hrs with a full organized squad the event scales up and every one gets a chance to tag the mobs
---
id rather they remove the godawful projectile.
---
Liquor? I hardly know her!
---
rip
---
Just because you don't like a certain effect, does not mean it doesn't exist.
---
This is amazing! The chain on the leg could be black, would that look good?
---
Yeah, like I said though I just don't have any builds that really use them.   I'd go with the great sword but all of the ascended gs all look way too chunky and plastic.
---
Exordium has no trail tho
---
I hate Tarir and DS because they are on set timers, this map is not which means you can drop in anytime, if the map is in a state that is not beneficial to what you want to do you just lookf or another instance. In tarir and DS you cannot do that easily as every map that is 'good' will be full. This map and silverwastes for instance are way better for players that want to  play at their own pace and not look at the clock to see when they can participate in a certain meta event.
---
Meteorlogicus doesn't have any draw animation or aura
---
it does when u swing it
---
It's a substitute, KR-424 is overqualified, they don't want to deal with that. It's a world where silver is basically less valuable than wood, same probably applies to gold. I'm 98.9% sure by now Scruffy could accomplish not only as much as the player, but very likely a lot more (at least in the hurt department). So shhh! Your job is just as much on the line.
---
&gt; it's literally dragon's stand and tarir combined 
---
There's simply more to do, and less downtime between objectives, than either Dragon Stand or Tarir individually. Perhaps combining their mechanics is what makes me like this one. There's just more to it.
---
Also the map layout is infinitely more enjoyable to me, and the thematic differences between each of the zones keeps things fresh &amp; entertaining too.
---
Dragonstand is boring as fuck to roam around in.
---
That was likely a Shatterer. 
---
Tequatl appears at the start of Tower Down too.
---
Yeah they're most likely for the Rifts a Skyscale can travel that opens up some alternate traverse paths with treasure at the end.
---
No
---
Adding another vote against the timegate. As many have said, it ruins the experience and does not work with many's schedules. 
---
I'm very busy throughout the week. Come the weekend I can dedicate more time to the grind. Sucks that I can't play catch up. Also really bummed that I finished a collection about an hour after reset and decided to just stop playing and log out in frustration of not being able to continue content I want to play.
---
Lastly, I'm curious what percentage of players have completed each time gated content in the game. I think the griffon and beetle are great examples. Beetle had collections, but they were accessible. Griffon required a fair bit of gold, and was more exclusive. But the skyscale is quite central in the latest episode. The map was even designed around it. I don't think the skyscale is something to exclude players from, and the time gates have the ability to turn players away from it. That's a shame.
---
Thanks!  
---
Thanks!
---
Yep, and they don't count towards the kill achievement either probably for the same reason. Either that or because they don't give exp.
---
Rox: What was that?
---
Miner Mikhail: Whatever it is, I'll bet you it's counterrevolutionary.
---
Personal favourite from Thunderhead Peaks.
---
Try playing scrapper. I have both jugg and sharur and there is only ONE skill effect (grenade barrage) that gets augmented by the leggies.
---
If you have the game code you can unlock it, even without a character name. Doesn't mean it won't take longer for them to respond, since they have to prove ownership of the account. The more pieces you have the faster it is.
---
are you sure 1000 will be enough? get 2k just in case
---
Griffon was the last mount of the Path of Fire expansion and it didn't have this level of gating.
---
Nah i call bullshit on this. What the hell do you consider good repeatable content, if this meta does not fit the bill? It showers you in rares and champions bags, takes the best parts of dragon stand,silverwastes and auric basin and mixes them together in a pretty cool way. You get an exotic and an ascended armor with achievements that are tied to actually playing the meta. The vendors  are unlocked by playing the meta and they finally let you buy ascended trinkets with volatile magic. There is a new set of ascended weapons with a really cool effect that can only be dropped on this map.
---
But you have not got the skyscale after 1 hour , so everything sucks right?
---
I got someone to run me through their version of the instance and it worked, i’d Suggest trying that as well.
---
If you manage to stay within maps where fewer people of your server are fighting so you get the "Outnumbered" buff you get about 40-50 an hour.
---
Youre farming WvW tickets in the first place, heropoints come after that as selectable loot from chests. Youre there for the PvP and can also make Points passively - if you have done some WvW in the past chances are you allready have some currency and can instantly unlock some elitespecs. Also while WvW you can stockpile on those tokens for other alts of yours, sure Herotrains might be faster but the instant unlock from a little bit of WvW over the span of a week is rather nice.
---
That is actually a pretty great idea
---
I think you summed up most of it perfectly :)
---
I'd like to add that the different zones look gorgeous &amp; unique, which keeps it from getting stale.
---
Dragon's Stand is on a set timer though... It's always half an hour after AB meta, and resets every two hours.
---
Oops yeah, I got my own references mixed up, I meant no set timers like SW.
---
I disliked necromancer but really dig the reaper elite specialization. Definitwly try thwm because the playstyle can change a lot.
---
Just like how I hate ranger but LOVE the elite spec soulbeast.
---
Is there a way to circumvent the chat tab limit? I already have 5 tabs but would like more, for incoming and outgoing, and a chat tab per guild to make following conversations easier. I really fail to see the point of limiting the number of tabs you can have.
---
If anyone knows of a hack (legal) for this, please let me know.
---
As I said, they work the same way Teq/TT skins do. If it was infusion like choya/gerent ones then sure, but armor skins should never be on TP IMO.
---
You forgot "Take a look!"
---
I never said that the scion weapons should be on the TP
---
Just wanted to say that I am in love with Exordium. Made it within 15 minutes of the server going live after I started getting the mats and everything together right after it was revealed. 
---
If I could give one tiny bit of criticism though I feel it should be scaled about 5-10% shorter. Width is fine but I've noticed it clips into the ground a lot on certain terrain due to the very long length. Sometimes even just walking it clips. That is a normal thing that happens on many greatswords but just a little annoying to see on a legendary.
---
You did mention them being account bound and those 2 usually go together.
---
As someone who learned to play Griffon somewhat professionally and can do the Halloween adventure on it, I have no idea what to do with the Skyscale. It's not even it being limited or the timegate that's the issue, it's just...so typical. After Anet has come up with such a diverse cast of unique mounts with profoundly different movement styles, it baffles me that they made a standard Korean MMO flying mount, and had to effectively downgrade even that so that it doesn't nullify using the others. Curious to see how can they justify its existence on next maps but right now it\`s just for floating around next to waypoint while using the inevitable ultra shiny skin.
---
Ascended weapon drops? From what?
---
For objects moving slowly, yes. For objects accelerating under gravity for 2km, no. For things supposedly travelling at the speed of sound, definitely no.
---
😂
---
Haha, it was a really dumb fix...
---
Bringing skill clicking to a whole New level.
---
I really need to know. Will new effects be added retroactively to new elite specializations if they have new animations?
---
This is a very strong and well-done guide... but you really have to be committed to playing GW2 already to get use of it.
---
I approve of the timegate
---
She really blew it out of the park with this one, proving that legendaries are more than what meets the eye.
---
Incorrect: There is a recipe to craft Sigils of Nullification.
---
I don't like them either. You usually don't have exactly 20 items that you want to be invisible, so either it's too much and will hide trash at vendors or for salvage or it's too little, so some of my permanent inv stuff is hidden while others isn't and that kind of inconsistency is just something I really dislike. If there was an invis bag that didn't hide stuff, but allowed you to select a hide status from the contextmenu of items... That I would use.
---
For the reason I mentioned first people tend to make the last bag invis, so trash only filters in once everything else fills up. But now exchanging 2 1h weapons for 1 2h weapon will seperaten the location where your disequiped gear lands in an annoying way... :-/
---
Because they aren't unique skins, they are just remodeled crafted skins with unique animation, just like skins from mentioned 2 bosses who have same features and acquisition methods. 
---
I know Anet likes being inconsistent, but there's no reason to implement it any other way. Scion weapons are already following the same path, it's just a different path from ls4 skins.
---
This and the one that guy posted on the front page are kind of heart to see because there's really bad contrast on the markers vs the map itself
---
It's not a bad idea in general consider stroke / semi-transparent backgrounds for readability
---
Unfortunately I think most writers who get hired for videogame studios nowadays basically align more with Syfy style shows than true fantasy writers. It's just so cringy when you get fantasy settings with what amounts to modern day idiosyncrasy coated in high fantasy art. It's phony to its very core.
---
The good thing about GW2 is that you can have as many alts as you want. Well that is not totally true but you can haev 70 characters and all of those characters share pretty much everything. Wallet, bank, mounts, dyes, minis, gliders, outfits well everything that is accountbound you can share. So most players have many alts so that they can swap and play what ever they like, need  or want for the moment.
---
&gt; transforming sword
---
&gt; more than meets the eye
---
I see what you did there
---
Necro scepter has no projectiles to beginn with.
---
Yes, and it’s a terrible path that everyone despises. No one thinks teq’s hoard is rewarding, no one see’s someone with a teq weapon and thinks “wow, they worked really hard for that”. Just because that’s how they did it *years* ago doesn’t mean they should continue with an unrewarding and flawed acquisition method
---
I LOVE Auric Basin and Tangled Depth and I LOVE this one. Kralk's fight music is amazing too. This is a great meta map for sure. I am enjoying it.
---
Adrenal mushrooms, effects from Sirens Landing (at least Melandru one) and branded version of bloodstone leyline gliding skills would also be great.
---
I went to Bloodstone Fen, and a little mining got it for me.
---
Did just that.
---
I know, it's just I got so much that I had to turn it into bricks or Herta food.

That's the thread I meant. Blish-ing Taimi (or killing her off, Alchemy/Spirits/Pale Tree/The Five or Six forbid).
---
11 times you gotta go back to the same place....
---
So, I want to get into PvP.
---
I used to play a little few years back but eventually got bored of the base game, and I didn't played much, stopped at lvl 30.
---
Recently I picked up Path of Fire DLC and I want to know how to get into PvP, how to get the gear, where to PvP etc.
---
I already used my lvl 80 boost to level up a thief, so I'll guess I'm going to stay with this class. I don't have the heart of thorns DLC so I'm probably going to stay with normal Thief, not Deadeye as I'm not a fan of ranged classes in general and it looks pretty cheesy. Is the normal thief even worth trying considering there's the daredevil subclass/whatever is this stuff called? Either that, or Weaver. And I've heard that GW2 isn't that hardcore with gear grinding, is this right?
---
&gt;collection quest that took you more than one day to do WITHOUT needing to be Timegated
---
It's impossible as long as collection doesn't involve incredibly RNG heavy part or is exceptionally long while being entirely personalized (AKA RNG heavy, but worse because takes near infinite time to create).
---
There a joke in your comment I want to make, but I'll think I'll get ban for it. So I'll hand this to someone else.
---
It is not about wanting it is about GW2 players at any point taking advantage of a game spot and either afk farm it or overfarm it and in both cases it hurts the game either by players not doing the intended events and focus on non stop farming somehting or they crash the echonomy. So talk to the players who fall in to this behaviour and ask them to stop it and Arena Net can reward us as they did in the past.
---
Raids should get their legendary ring soon though, which brings us to 2/5 trinket slots. I'm surprised this season doesn't have one but if we get one next season, that's still good progress on the full set.
---
Remember that this is really the far endgame for gear in the game. Once all 5 legendary trinkets (and technically the aqua breather but who cares) are out, gear progression will be dead forever, even more so than it already is if you've got lots of ascended lying around. They shouldn't rush that in a season or two.
---
In 2 weeks it will become 422
---
They always manage to get better PogU.
---
It is really well designed in terms of each part being fun and rewarding with interesting events that don't get too tedious, as someone mentioned it's best part of every previous meta map.
---
Personally, I would like slightly harder more engaging end bosses like those in HoT, but coordination could be too frustrating.
---
First I adress the 3 points you made:
---
1: Time gates are just generally bad but just like with everything that is bad there is a scale.
---
2: How about they just implement a system that changes the content with the "best gold/gour ratio" daily? You know similiar to how fractals do it? There was the "40 farm" but most people just did the dailies and all fractals were actually played. Of course it would have to be a bit different for open world maps and it could be made even better. My idea: Add a new PvE reward track that changes daily. One day it is Verdant Brink, one day it is Istan, another day it is something else. They could also have multiple per day like one for each expansion for example. Make it about 1 or 2 hours for the whole reward track and after finishing it once you still get additional loot but much less.
---
3: How about they add content that isn't cumbersome and annoying without a guide? Most of this "content" are egg hunts. "Here we put 37 things on the map and you have to find them. Have fun!" No wonder everybody uses guides for these.
---
As for the answer to what content they should make obviously the above mentioned "Daily Reward Track" (or some other kind of daily bonus that is actually rewarding)
---
And otherwise some more challenging content would be great. Maybe solo instances but that content isn't really repeatable. Some dungeons would probably be great too but we all know Anet doesn't add them anymore and instead we get fractals (very rarely).  
---
So how about difficult 5-man "boss" instances? They could be tied to this extra content and after you have killed the boss once it could also be added to a new daily system similiar to fractals. For example the last step for the dragonscale could be a 5-man instanced boss fight where you fight alongside your dragonscale. That fight should be a bit difficult but not too hard. Harder than a T4 fractal boss but maybe a bit easier than a fractal CM boss. After that you finish the "quest line" you can repeat the fight again for decent rewards when it's the "daily boss".
---
Lastly a decent start would be adding a propper quest system to the game instead of abusing the achievement and collection UI for this kind of content. Just update the UI a bit for this kind of content so it's obvious which achievements are part of that "quest" and maybe add past quest text to it.
---
Sorry I'm working with paint not Photoshop, I did the best i could with what I had.
---
Hah! Gottem.
---
Posts like this are reason why developers are afraid of experimenting and creating new, fresh effects for skins, because there will always be complaining that older skins also should get them. And it's practically impossible for dev team to justify dedicating time to retroactively introducing new, "modern" features to old pieces of content.
---
Dare Devil is the most fun thief build to play in the open world. I think HoT is on sale too isn't it? If so it is for 14.99 just a hint if you were looking for it.
---
I like how you're still unable to construct an proper and understandable english sentence that's not filled with nonsense.
---
I just won a match with the enemy like 10 points behind. We had a clutch 3 point cap while losing and all we had to do was stall :)
---
They really should have decoupled those on kill effects and experience gain years ago.
---
Check out [Paint.net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paint.net)
---
I like it, so there goes your 100%.
---
Great weapon, I love that it transforms. Thanks for the insight!
---
I mean the predator is nice, but can literally any rifle skill please have some interaction? *please?*
---
Blah blah blah blah blah.  Some's salty.  Whine much?
---
&gt; But you have not got the skyscale after 1 hour , so everything sucks right?
---
Strawman, how about debating honestly.
---
That gave me chills. We usually think of the dragon minions as mindless monsters, but they're still conscious inside their warped bodies! And they can't control themselves!
---
I'm not saying the collection is good lol, going around the map 3 times in a row was obviously retarded padding.
---
I'm just that the timegate itself is not grind, you can have grind, timegating or both, the collection has both.
---
Iirc they changed it so LS maps no longer give keys to sub level 80s on completion
---
It is "hard" in the sense that it is going to take several more days just to unlock. The beetle was "easy" in the sense that it didn't take long to unlock.
---
It's from the original mount pack.  My guess is that we'll see it towards the end of August if they do an anniversary sale.
---
cry and start gathering materials to make one
---
&gt;And it's not just waiting around fiddling with your thumbs waiting for the timewall to go down. You have to go around maps finish collection, go do stuff, wait for stuff, wait for more stuff, and the rest to be determined.
---
After you've done the collection you're forced to wait the timewall is my issue. I can tolerate grind if its at my own pace.
---
&gt;People compare it to legendary grind for a reason.
---
You can craft legendaries in a day though. People had exordium before the daily reset.
---
Didnt do many thing on the map but for the few i did realize that anet did a mix of very good things in previous maps. This maps feel prety good mixing things like navigation map feel a bit like TD, event rotations like SW, meta boss mixing SW-VW, AB-TARIR, SW extra champs. Loot chests a bit like istan and SW. Even puting masterys in map from other maps feel good to, like jump muchrums, the spider webs, lava tunels of ember bay, and even the WP during meta like other map. In the end mostra things feel good mixed.

I'd kill for a horde mode where you get to unleash your everything on endless mobs.

Gw2 ripping off warframe's arbitrationsm with solo/coop endless survival/objective missions that with steadily increasing difficulty and rewards that reward you the longer you last before dying/number of objectives you can complete before dying would be great.

In terms of GW2: Living Story ascended trinkets, Knight of the Thorn cheap ascended weapon, overall ways to easily earn high/highest tier equipment is a catch up mechanic for new players to get into raiding/fractals. Reintroducing Queens Jubilee festival and readding retired achievements was a way to catch up with achievements points for new achievement hunters. Introducing LS4 currency vendor in Dragonfall is easy way for people to catchup with currency-gated features of earlier LS4 achievements/content.

Just for example, but there is quite a few other.

Enter the [PvP lobby](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Heart_of_the_Mists), your character gets boosted to level 80 while there (so you can use any level character), you can use the menu at the top to select PvP build, amulet (PvP amulet controls all stats, stats on gear don't matter, can be in all whites and it's fine), and runes/sigils. Base thief is fine in PvP, should also be mentioned though that just because deadeye *can* use rifle doesn't mean they have to. [Metabattle](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Conquest) has some suggested PvP builds that you can consider. Feel free to practice or try characters/builds in the PvP lobby as all skills and traits that you have access to are unlocked. There are also [guides you can read on metabattle](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guides#PvP).

I am in super love with Exordium...but I feel like the footfalls are super short compared to every other foot fall....they disappear after 2-3 steps while weapons like Xiquatl disappear after 6-7

You can do all of the toys and treats at once, the only real timegate is the food.

It's already great as it is, thank you very much.

I really miss Dulfy. The GW2 wiki's "guides" are nowhere near good enough (those pierced together screenshot showing a rotated minimap are far from being useful).
