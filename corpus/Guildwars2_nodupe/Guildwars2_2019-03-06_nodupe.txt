Do i need something special to run this?
---
---
---
It references more wvw armor set (wielded tentacle things)  than pharus imo
---
Money was the purpose of the mount.
---
Some of those are very risky, and the scale with your level. The enemies from the quests do not give exp, so they can't be farmed. One has to do them daily to level up.
---
Yeah! xD but instead of ranking time it would rank who goes further!
---
I'd recommend Gliding 2, Itzel 2, Exalted 1, and Nuhoch 1 as those are what you need to unlock the various story steps.
---

---
After those I'd say Gliding 5 (Advanced Techniques) as that and everything below it can be used anywhere.
---
He lost me when he decided we all needed to know about how he lost his virginity.
---
That is the western damn in the Alpine Borderlands.
---
Well the rate when farming the nodes are normal compared to other living story map nodes which got buffed in today's patch
---
If you're a class cannon under the effects of Defiance, are you still a glass cannon? ü§î
---
it needs to be run from the command prompt since it has no UI.
---
If it fits, it sits.
---
Oh wow.
---
I'm amazed there wasn't a literal parade in the streets because of this. That is for letting me know.
---
That might work if they didn't have 3 evades at 500 range each.
---
Yikes 
---
How long will the new WvW  boost last?
---
I always loved this review. I was already a Gw1 player but, had moved on to WoW so was hesitant to jump into Gw2 but this review got me soo hyped.
---
But brings home the money, and that's something you can buy your groceries with. 
---
Is this in the new 1k gems gated area?
---
1 week.
---
If you have a mount, simply mount up, dismount and mount up again in quick succession.
---
The second time you‚Äôre summoning your mount the minions will not have finished spawning yet, so they‚Äôre destroyed instead.
---
&gt;Break game mode with poorly thought out and implemented gimmick features
---
&gt;Fail to fix serious fundamental issues and instead introduce fluff content and monetisation
---
"whiny little bitches"
---
In one sense, yes WvW players are whiny. But they also have reason to whine. 
---
I can easily admit the game flaws, the lack of instanced content, unfair monetization of living world towards new players, lack of better new player experience in terms that the game poorly explain it's mechanics, lack of pvp and wvw updates, so how am i ruining gw2 again? By spreading misinformation like you do? Or maybe i didn't played this game for 6 years? Your previous comment doesn't make sense, your idiotic conspiracy theories about linking world doesn't make sense, if not the megaserver you'll be stuck on your dead server both in pve and wvw by now, it not server linking, everyone would leave your server for a more active one anyway and you wouldn't have a chance to experience proper wvw for free, if arenanet wouldn't monetize their game, it would be dead and if you'd think with your head just for a couple of minutes you wouldn't say such retarded things. I'm out, have fun in your little world.
---
Honestly that was a big reason I dropped ESO (aside from general gameplay I didn't care for sadly). Every patch was an ordeal of downloading and waiting for everything to process and layers of patches yikes...
---
&gt; The aztec tequila named dragon guy was my first.
---
XD I‚Äôm sorry, huh???????? The weapon, the world boss (Tequatl??), or....
---
Sounds like the world boss dragon, good fun!! World bosses are a blast! Do you play EU or NA? And what time zone/time do ya play? I‚Äôll tag along!
---
Basically: don't solo roam. Roam in packs and gang up on people instead. Some people will see that as dishonourable but that's how the game is designed.
---
And the mounts will pay for it
---
[it's over 400](https://i.imgur.com/sCyCMyi.jpg)
---
Never drop that much siege on a tower, it's just not worth it, brute force will cost you more than just prolonging a fight against any tower
---
Cat the manapults!
---
Season 3: Episodes 1, 2, 3, 5 ‚Äî maybe 6. Great for farming Ascended trinkets + back item. Getting the full set isn't a bad idea either and you can work on the Legendary trinket [Aurora](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Aurora) as well. Thanks to the Blood Ruby buff, you could probably get by fine with just 1 and 3 if you're okay with a bit slower completing of sets over time.
---
Season 4: Episode 2 (Ascended trinkets), 3 (Roller Beetle mount)
---
PvP/WvW reward tracks are really good for farming the map materials. Other than that just keep doing daily map runs.
---
Happening to me as well, I also have the shrine jackal. Thank you. 
---
Yeah. Looking outside the edges of the map should show you a painted landscape under the sky giving the illusion that the map keeps going on. 
---
Specially in the Crystal Desert maps. 
---
Right now getting looking over the walls of most maps looks just awful.
---
But now you only open them once per day AND they're worse. It's pretty bad.
---
Sacred Spoon?

---
I am a simple man. I see *the proper dragon guide*, I updoot.
---
Brb putting on my " I am an easy target in wvw" sign, anyone who downs me is now officially considered unjust and immoral. 
---
Real talk: if you find yourself as one of these "easy targets" and constantly running away from roamers, then your build simply aren't suitable for roaming by yourself or at all. 
---
In the end it's not like it took that many hours to mine the nodes.  
---
However there was a cap on getting the henge backpiece so I was not in a rush.  
---
WvW/PvP was my backup plan
---
This is always asked of WvW Lifers and they never have a real response to it. They cry about their game being dead and ignored and whenever anything is done to it or when people check it out for whatever reason they reee until people go "I want no part of this circus." and leave forever. 
---
Then they whine on forums about WvW being dead and stagnant. The community there (at least a very vocal minority of it) do more harm to WvW than Anet and PvE'ers combined.
---
WH5, Lich Form minions, G4, then go into Reaper Shroud for +600 ferocity.
---
Speed should be the same as on foot. Faster movement speed alone is a huge issue (for example you can't outrun enemies in their territory).
---
Thanks for the concise info. What exactly is the Blood Ruby?
---
It procs any on swap sigils due to how these work - you are in combat once the engage skill hits, dismount and then you're switching to a weapon set from nothing, thus proccing the rune.
---
This hurts most in the Desolation. Looking over the Bone Wall, knowing that a vast desert should be there but seeing emptiness reminds me so much that every place on Tyria is a disconnected zone in a videogame.
---
As someone that plays WvW, if you're having fun and not just being afk, I think it's all good. 
---
Just like all the income from PvE went to them before the other side projects were can- Oh wait!
---
They do. You can't have a nicely designed guild hall plus huge empty spaces for free decorating. It's either one or another, the middle-ground being a mess that satisfies no side.
---
they were released a week ago
---
It's still a massive buff for WvW group play. The "gyros" stay realistically stay alive far longer and don't trail behind anymore. If your allies need 600 range rather than 360 traited then your allies are monkeys. And no amount of healing can save monkeys from rallybotting. 
---
Hey ANet, how about you change the gyros back and just make the stealth, healing, and bulwark ones follow you. You ruined my ranged build with this idiotic change.
---
They might be part of a low pop server, and many people are at work. For there to be a queue at all is very rare for many servers. I expect the queues will increase significantly during primetime.
---
Yeah I wouldn‚Äôt get your hopes up. As we‚Äôve seen anet is funneling away from GW2. And they have said nothing to say other wise. 
---
Neither of there two ‚Äúupdate posts‚Äù suggested they are doing any big projects in the works. 
---
After 1 hour of RIBA I got 1 Carapace box, no Warclaw helmet sadly. :(
---
Methinks that's not how wages work but if the response to Warclaw skins is huge then perhaps. It will probably at least go to skin development.
---
Nobody's asking you to stop, we're just asking you not to be a dick about it
---
Lul reque 
---
WvW is made up of a bunch of different people with differing opinions and attitudes.  Saying "u guys say the game is ded but then ur mean" is not some "gotcha" to WvW players.  If someone really hurt your feelings that much block them. 
---
There's no such thing as overkill when you really want to cap an objective
---
You'll need to get off your high horse and throw away those inaccurate assumptions of how people you don't understand think before you can contribute to the discussion. 
---
WvW is a diverse group of people, from sad angry trolls in team chat to guilds and players that have fun doing their thing. So it is impossible for anyone to "enforce" these rules. Trolls gonna troll. Many people I know aren't playing WvW right now because the queues are too long. I've also heard that team chat is far more toxic right now with the influx. How many of those "trolls" are people who've left the game mode and come back to troll around in it and blame Anet, I wonder?
---
The thing with what you call "PvE plebs" is that many of them aren't interested in the game mode at all. That's fine. There's the secondary issue that the next few weeks are going to be unrepresentative of what WvW is like in general. Keeping "PvE plebs" in the mode almost exclusive consists of recruiting them and keeping them in a guild. The majority of players will come in and not commit, and they will find it very difficult to continue. This is fine, the game mode is already very hard to get into by its nature. 
---
The other thing relating to this is that organised WvW is a big commitment, as is any PvP game/mode. You can't really 'casually' play in a zerg, you need a gear commitment, and trust in your group, and understand the calls, and learn to play without dying in half a second. Thus, the majority of excited new players join guilds and stay in the mode, and those that don't want that commitment will leave and be called "PvE plebs" by some trolls.
---
Tl;dr barrier of entry is too high, game mode is pretty unfun unless you get past that barrier. I don't know who you're accusing of trolling, the majority of players and guilds I know aren't even playing right now because they can't get in. It's just some trolls.
---
I could never get into wvw because how slow we move the warclqws about to change all that
---
See here's the thing, most people playing WvW don't actually really think it's that fun anymore.  Most are waiting for a better game to come around.  What's left is mostly with nothing better to do with their time, and as such they're salty all the time.  I'm happy I have other things to do than play GW2, because I played only for this mode, and it's worse than most asian import P2W games at this point.
---
It has very little to even do with the community size or the people involved now.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The WvW community fell apart because of nonsensical balance and terrible class design (most of the game's balance and design has been for PvE with sPvP as a side effect and WvW just not mattering) and stuff like the Warclaw which has traditionally gone unaddressed for months or years at a time.  It took the better half of a year for ANet to fix gliding so that enemies couldn't glide into a number of towers/keeps...
---
There's a lot of resentment for PvE players because they usually don't care to learn or try (AFK pip farming for loot, refusing to adjust builds, listen to advice, or communicate in general), and  jealousy, as ANet has repeatedly provided immediate hotfixes when something has broken PvE despite being broken in WvW for extended periods.  Ghost thief being one of the most pronounced examples ever.  Overpowered build for almost 3 YEARS with heavy complaints and frustrations.  It solo'd a raid, and was nerfed out-of-patch the day after.
---
So yeah, sorry for anyone actually interested in being part of the scene long-term at this point, but almost no WvW veterans see a future in either GW2 or WvW as a whole, and just don't care anymore and at this point would just rather see it all burn down because for the better half of a decade, it's been a wasted leech of false hope.
---
Read the first line. Literally the first thing I said.
---
Same shit new mount i would play a different mmo i dont see gw2 lasting much longer i heard eso is getting an xpac try them.
---
Damn you!
---
I think people are whining while still enjoying breaking it. Definitely leaving something broken long term is bad. It's at least more interesting than doing the exact same thing week after week for years.
---
Each of the LS3 and LS4 maps come with their own "map currency" of sorts - a resource you can only collect there. Check out [this page for Season 3](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Living_World_Season_3).
---
The [Blood Ruby](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Blood_Ruby) is used for acquiring an ascended amulet, ring, and back item which allows you to pick a stat from the core game or heart of thorns.
---
How do you even do that when he's in an instance in which you can't mount?
---
Guess I'll never see it then.
---
It actually sounds exactly the same as the Forged Jackal skin footsteps. It's one of the first mounts you could have bought in the gemstore. I have it, and have recognized it immediately. I wish it was a unique sound.
---
Also, the Idle 1 animation is the same one as griffon. I think the Warclaw is a little bit less unique than it should be. It even shares the same rig as the griffon. I'd honestly welcome some adjustments, at least to the footstep sounds.
---
That's not how it works.
---
I was just about to ask you to put your gold where your mouth is and bet you 100g that it would be fixed within 3 days when I got a discord notification. It was a bot telling me that there was a patch to gw2 that fixed this bug.
---
So I dunno, you be the judge.
---
Comparing balance changes to bugs lol
---
It is indeed the case for the Dragon Reverly Starcake, the Red Lentil and Flatbread Feast and I believe Birthday Blaster has also been stealthily fixed recently to give the correct amounts.
---
Usually true, not always the case (blue part) some might be other colors and still public (if not, you're likely to be told about it soon enough lol)
---
Yes I got the tail twice and noticed this but decided I wanted the mount more than the exploit and unlocked collection 
---
Let druids have this...
---
Literally, the first thing I said was "if this doesn't apply to you, it's not directed at you".
---
I agree with you but it works both ways I have seen toxic PVE players today clogging up team chat with utter crap also so maybe both sets of toxic players should cool it and just have fun 
---
Eh. Some of the HoT specs are still pretty viable. And non-PoF players shouldn't be locked out of core content just because of elitists like you.
---
&gt; In a big zerg with **an awesome commi** 
---
PLOT TWIST: It was a PvE comm!!!  
---
In all seriousness, most of WvW commanders are very cool and fun players, i've had plenty of enjoyment every time i visit this mode, it's a shame its so abandoned.
---
You say that and then attack some straw man representation of the WvW 'toxic' population that doesn't exist. None of them are here to listen to this. 
---
In any case, there are structural issues with the mode which lead to the unwelcoming environment and game mode. These problems will persist as has been the case for other WvW changes in the past. These are more troublesome than these "toxic" people.
---
Sure, but doing it in a borderline P2W way isn't in GW2's best interest.
---
I still really want core engi to get a mace. Makes so much sense to go with shield as a defensive melee weapon (since pistol matches up with off-hand pistol).
---
Implementation might be another matter though.
---
It's for people like you, as a seasoned WvW'er, I'm happy for. Fresh blood that sticks around after the polish wears off, it's good for our game mode. 
---
People wanna complain about the queues, and bitch about how anet is pushing pve'ers into wvw, but truth be told, even if it's no longer a thing, *MANY* of us started out in WvW because of PvE, specifically, having to map for World Completion. I was one of those people 5 1/2yrs ago. Soooo bloody glad I didn't give up.
---
So, to all you new comers who take this with a grain of salt and stick it out, kudos, and welcome to WvW. 
---
GW2 was the reason I subscribed to TotalBiscuit. RIP.
---
I mean, that is a shame, since I've always wanted to get into WvW.
---
I do see guilds recruiting now, so pardon me if I think some WvW'ers still think the game mode is worth saving, or at least, they'd like some new blood in the game.
---
I love Guild Wars 2, I want to see *all* aspects of the game work, it's just frustrating to see a handful of morons ruin one part of it for a whole bunch of players.
---
Melee attack assist. Turn off. 
---
Makes more sense, I guess. It's a very pretty glider, though. 
---
Why do you think toxic elitists are going to listen to you and this post? How do you suppose that toxic elitists can be managed?
---
Oh that's right, just ignore them, like you ignore them in every mode.
---
The real problem is that WvW is a PvP mode and most people don't like dying and having to put in effort to achieve something. PvE players gonna zerg around, wipe a few times and then leave once they're done. That isn't WvW at all.
---
Yeah there's always herald and chrono, and presumably tempest and scrapper are better now too. 
---
They should've given us ways to curate and form our own communities and servers; then elitists like me wouldn't be forced to play with people like you :o. 
---
S2E3 and S2E4 gives you items to craft Mawdrey and Mawdrey II, an ascended back item and a gobbler
---
S2E6 gives you a free black lion chest key upon completion.
---
While S3 and S4 all give maps and the former gives partial access to Aurora, there's additional stuff:
---
S3E1: Bloodstone Fen (Easy to complete map), ascended trinkets with more easily changeable stats
---
S3E3: Easy ascended trinkets
---
S3E4: Relatively easy map dailies
---
S3E5: Ascended backpiece
---
S3E6: MULTIPLE ascended backpieces
---
All of LS4 gives out some form of ascended gear, so I'll just list the things that are not ascended gear:
---
LS4E1: Map meta (Though there was another nerf today)
---
LS4E3: Roller Beetle mount
---
LS4E5: While this isn't completely confirmed, I have noticed an unusual number of people boasting about getting a black lion chest key for map completion.
---
Poor Teapot was so hyped today to unlock it immediately. 
---
These are my favorite in a long time.  :D
---
i mean im talking about running against other groups that raid in wvw constantly lol. I do understand the need to differentiate the newbies from the veterans.
---
The +1s were from the bloodlust bug sure, but all those +2s were not. 
---
large AoE 10 player limit, 2k damage with minstrel scales with power / crit and instantly kills downed players.
---
Oh, so nothing new, just 5% more direct damage than yesterday?
---
Hope you have a good time, although be mindful that the experience you'll get for the event period is probably not much like the experience you'll get outside of it (for better or worse).
---
Oh, you mean you can't wait to go into a format riddled with permastealth 13k+ malicious backstab deadeyes and 8 sec immunity, crazy self healing and burst spellbreakers/zerker warriors?
---
Yes.
---
&gt; As we‚Äôve seen anet is funneling away from GW2
---
Can't tell if troll or ignorant of recent events. They was funneling and its why NCsoft stepped in and made them lay off a huge chunk and forced them to focus 100% on GW2 again. 
---
See [https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/70477/major-bug-weapon-skill-while-on-warclaw#latest](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/70477/major-bug-weapon-skill-while-on-warclaw#latest)
---
3-5k + 4 stacks of bleed on 10 targets
---
Idk if damage scales with boons and other stuff, but my engage did fairly weak/average damage. Everything is op when you multiply it.
---
Heavenly knife.
---
Combined you have the Mystic Utensils and you're unstoppable.
---
You know, posting this here only encourages them.
---
So it is not all good news...
---
The Dictator is a great film, however this scene is actually from You Don't Mess with the Zohan. 
---
Druid used to be able to provide reliable stability, now the new Elite Spirit is so useless, merely providing ~6s of Stability at **40s cd.** Even Guard's non elite "Stand Your Ground!" is better. 
---
GG melee dps in daze spam fractals. 
---
Better burst with less ramp up maximum, not a bad change. Renegades were absurdly powerful for ages. I'd rather we get some number hits rather than losing mechanics or getting higher cooldowns or something. 
---
xD xD xD xD
---
Mate, do you have any kind of mental illness?  
---
And I am not even adressing your faulty arguementation 
---
Not if the returns over time are equal.
---
After that, evaluating which farm is "best" depends on other factors. If the farm is more fun, difficult, or whatever other preference a person may have.
---
Thank you so much for your response!
---
We're very similar it seems! I'm very freeform with my skills and abilities too so all this gives me renewed determination!
---
I have never roamed but I am willing to learn. I used to do sort of roaming with my friend when I first started WvW (me on guard and him on engineer). It was mostly to learn/introduce me to the mode rather than "we're going to capture all these things and fight these people" etc.
---
I have played with some zergs in the past but I get discouraged dying all the time, or feeling like I'm not doing things right. My biggest issue is with abbreviations or names of places/locations. Things like "Keep" don't mean anything in my head. I always have to wait like a dummy for the comm/whole zerg to lead the way or waypoint to the location, or spend way longer than I'd like to admit staring at the map wondering what "WC" means.....
---
I think I will try to transfer servers so I can play WvW with my friend again. He is my only GW2 friend and the one that introduced me to WvW so I think it will be best if I join his server to WvW with him, and his friends/his guild. :)
---
I will try to find more players (zergs, commanders, etc) that will be open to having me around, and try not to let the grumpy comms get to me. 
---
LOL and I'd argue that they're saying that just because people like you make a huge fuss over it by posting on reddit.
---
But the WvW ruleset is mostly the same as the PvE ruleset.....
---
The arena is still not the solution nor did they ever claim it would be. If this really was the GvG solution anet had planned, they would have talked about it (like they did with guild halls and the obsidian sanctum change).
---
oh you mean like engi turrets? i see
---
There would always be a best farm, yes. But you can offer variety for people who get bored or farms that offer different types of rewards if you want to target a specific material.
---
I'd happily do a farm that gives 22 gph if I get bored of the one that gives 25gph. I'm less happy doing one that gives 15gph.
---
Glad Anet got their priorities in order xD 
---
Welcome to the age of the turret warrior
---
Why give up free bags?
---
Istan was already weaker than riba. I'm not sure there's any argument that the second best Zerg farm in the game needs to be the only one that gets nerfed.
---
The instance can have people from any server. I even had someone from my matchup in the instance (I'm on SBI and the person was on ET, paired with FC) so it was nice to chat. I guess technically that's nothing special since you could do the same in any other map, but this is a wvw oriented map so it feels a little more intimate.
---
Daily fractal rewards makes repeat raid clears look insignificant and nonexistent. Don't compare the two.
---
You can buy the 2 week limited pass for 150 gems, its available they just dont advertise it as they do with the permanent one
---
But why nerf the second best farm in the game only? Why is silverwastes ok and istan needed nerfing?
---
I saw half of that number on my screen with such build. I do agree that warclaw is quite overturned with mobility and target limit+radius on engage skill.
---
Well if you want you can [convert it to gold](https://gw2efficiency.com/currencies/karma). But it is used all over, [armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Temple_armor) like you mentioned, [Back pieces](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/List_of_karma_merchant_items/Back_items) (specifically LSS3 Siren's landing ascended), [glyph tools](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/List_of_karma_merchant_items/Mining_Picks) if you don't have an unlimited version or the glyph, all of the [cultural weapon skins](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Cultural_weapon), Legendary collection unlocks, random loot items like wintersday gifts and ancient asuran power cores, tonics (I mean who doesn't need to be a [dancing choya](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Endless_Choya_Dance_Tonic)), [expensive minis](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mini_M.O.X.), recipe sheets ([just one of many examples](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Recipe:_Ascended_Insignia)), [useful gadgets](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Prototype_Position_Rewinder), etc, etc. Someone may not know what they want or need right now but most of the karma costs are very high so only having 200k is not an amount where I would be trying to convert it to gold or anything.
---
Where does the JP start?
---
That period in gaming was so amazing and great. But I will be sad if that ends up being the golden age. There is so much potential in this medium that is getting ignored or squeezed. 
---
Istan nerf...
---
I feel wvw has as much of an appeal as pvp because of how dominant some of the pof classes are.
---
Syncing issues will be quite apparent considering wvw already suffers from skill lag, so I wouldn't see it happening
---
Just FYI in case you are thinking of getting a lounge pass - they are not all created equal. Mistlock is widely regarded as the best one because it is the only pass (unless this new one added it too) that you can use it a second time to return to your previous area.
---
Wait, what kind of content did you want to play with this?
---
*\*been there*\*
---
I have 1000 or so in bank storage, without a home node.  I'd gladly sell them if I could.  I never understood all the griping.
---
That won't stop people from farming it.
---
That's not where most of the money comes in from.
---
And I won't tell you either, you fucked us over enough when you fucking nerfd golden city of tarir.
---
How dare you ruin the fun. Fuck off..... 
---
Have you gotten the Griffon, Rollerbeetle, [Prototype Position Rewinder](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Prototype_Position_Rewinder) and the mount masteries from LS4? Particularly the ones that boosts endurance and allow dismount (very useful to dismount from griffon and switch to gliding in HoT maps). 
---
These are my goals for my alt account. I'm currently working maxing Griffon masteries as well as the LS4 ones. 
---
Looks like a stylized take on the wings from the headpiece that Dwayna is often depicted wearing.
---
This is petty as all fuck.
---
Luckily the ‚Äúcommunity outrage‚Äù is apparently so insignificant and irrelevant that I haven‚Äôt heard anything about it until now.
---
Exactly. I stopped opening daily chests because my mat storage (1250) was full. I think I have two stacks of the chests. It's always fun to ping the chests and be called insane by friends and guildies :P
---
I named my smoke scale 'wegetityouvape'. I thought it was clever o:
---
Some big barrier on use and then another on end. First one only affects yourself, last affect everyone. 6 torment blast at end. It feels like a downgrade for condi scourge pvp wise, because why would you give your opponent a 3 second tell instead of pulsing damage?
---
In PvE it is a nice buff for heal scourges.
---
Valid point. This is what I am hoping that they continue this way because no other games that I know how this type of battle mechanics so for them to focus on this and spark interest of tournaments and the potential market/funds it can bring to GW2.
---
you are considered grandfathered in and wont have anything holding you back except other exclusive additions from the expansions only
---
To reiterate and add my spin. People are still playing the game and recruiting, because it's the only decent game with this kind of game mode out there currently. It's not about being hopeful for a better balance and more qol updates and everything, it's about making the best of what you have.
---
Wvw has long been an unfortunate mess, and  a lot of times it's unfun. But it's a hell of a lot more fun to most people than alternatives (other games and pve/spvp).

I genuinely hope that the influx grows the total number of players into wvw by maybe 10%,which might be enough for anet to get their shit together and give some much needed attention and focus to the game mode, and actually take well thought out and considered balance change suggestions into consideration. It's clear no one at anet play wvw extensively, or at the skill level of, a large portion of the roaming, havoccing or large scale fight zerg community. For a lot of players, the pve aspect of wvw (taking unguarded towers and keeps) a lot of balance doesn't affect them. The rest are greatly affected by it.

If you are too tired, then don't. As long as you claim (if you aren't on a full free account) the daily login reward, all is fine.
---
Wtf?
---
got the same thing but on my charr the arms were permanently stuck in the T position... you can imagine how that looked
---
Wth is this soulbeast shenanigans
---
I don't think anyone's response to your question, will help you much. I doubt people have the same job, hours, commitments, etc, to compare. 
---
So answers will probably be they just do, or they don't play when tired.
---
I feel bad for all the newbies getting to fight riversiege for the first time
---
Riiiiight ty for clarifying
---
I really wish I had time to play GW2 right now:( 
---
Having a full map of EOTM is always a blast and my favorite place to WvW
---
hahaha, that's pretty awesome =)
---
give it 2 months, it'll slow down again
---
It's not a job.
---
They could, but they wont get shinies as fast.
---
Just like you could go eotm and get your reward slower or just ignore the patch if you're not interested in wvw and acquire reward track potions from dailies (which can also be done in eotm).
---
Besides..if team chat is so offensive you might as well disable it. Most of the time there's just pointless spam anyway.
---
I think it's self explanatory.

I ended up finding a spot to break out of the map in WF and found a hole in the mountainside that allowed me to climb up onto the ring of mountains around bottom portion of the map. With the aid of my griffon and my springer and the mount masteries I was able to get all the way up onto the top of the peak in the bottom corner of the map.
---
In your free time you should do what you find fun or relaxing, if you find the game neither of these then take a break and play something else. 
---
can only speak from experience prior to this update, but the only time there's a queue is when AG is partnered up with a Tier 1 server - maybe I just don't know where to look ahah
---
You don't haha. You can only invest in an mmo when you have time.
---
I've gotten all my shits when I was bumming around. Now with more responsibilities, I'm just playing efficient. Jump into fracts daily, then log out. Next day, do a map completion, log out. Next day, do a hero point train, log out. etc.
---
Is this a good deal?
---
Literally everyone who played wvw thought it would be this broken lol. This is what we expect from anet
---
I also named my grizzly Smokey
---
Xalu!!
---
that is.. if you ever needed karma haha
---
Easy answer is you don't. It's either you force yourself stay in game to break into steel wall without bashing your head into it or you find other things to care aside of gaming. It's exactly might not be only reason why you can't stick in try another games if they keep your intrest. Or it might core problem that actully affects you irl like depression stage, which gaming usually normally should help.
---
Oh, okay, so the 392 isn't base speed, it's +33% base speed, that is to say, with ordinary Swiftness up? That's what was throwing me. I was reading that as base speed, and assuming that with swiftness that would bump up to 521.
---
Ha, good one
---
you probably noticed as well but if anyone else is wondering why the first 2 wvw spots for perfect fit (near the yellow and blue catmander) are missing, it's because they don't currently work because mounting up is forbidden in those locations, making the achievement impossible to complete. 
---
I only tested the blue one, but teamchat discussed the problem and it seems to persist after the first hotfix patch. it will probably soon be fixed, just don't waste time on those tricky jumps for now.
---
The answer is no one. You aren't owed updates to a game mode just because you play it and others don't.
---
ViP does as well, I know there‚Äôs another one as well as pugmanders.Very appreciated.
---
Bastion, I think you mean :)
---
Glad you had a good time. I hopped in long enough to get mine today. The thing is we need folks like you. Otherwise we will be popping out by next year to surprise the five people who are left! 
---
Same. Last chest sucked
---
IKR. If all the "retards" buying things on the gems store stopped doing it, game would die over night and and all these salty shits would lose their precious game mode. 
---
The longbow skin looks better than pharus imo.
---
If you get the mastery for extra endurance, does that carry over to open world as well? Or is it exclusive to wvw? Asking because that's 12 levels for me to get. 
---
I like the mount. I am a WvW vet. It is beyond OP. It needs nerfs. 
---
The speed is bonkers, but I really only dislike the speed difference on land you own versus land you don‚Äôt. Should be same speed everywhere like when unmounted. This mount will completely eliminate solo and small group roaming with such a speed difference. 
---
Damage to gates is pretty worthless. Especially when limited to only 3 mounts on a gate at once. I love the concept of rushing gates, but I think I did 5% damage to a gate using 20 total supply. That‚Äôs 15% damage for the max 3 players over 2 or so minutes burning through 60 supply. Building even a basic flame ram out damages this by a lot over same time. I‚Äôm not sure what the mount gate damage is supposed to do. 
---
The damage mounts does to players is insane. Seems to be generally agreed upon this is a problem. Although I love finishing downed players with the mount. 
---
I‚Äôm quite worried this mount won‚Äôt get a nerf for a long time considering the usual timeline for balance patches. As a WVW vet this worries me because this is really broken. 
---
No, it would not.
---
Is Istan available to people that didn't log in during the episode? If not, it's likely splitting the player base.
---
If I were Anet I'd nerf farming in Istan as well and push people to core maps.
---
I'd want people in SW because it's part of the core game so F2P players can get to it easily, letting nonF2P and F2P mix. Level 80 boosters plop people straight into SW so an alive SW has more chance of hooking fresh 80s. SW has a more interesting meta with clear chains, objectives, and a "final boss" that shows off map wide coordination between lanes. SW also preps people for the looming threat of HoT rather than Istan's so it's great prep for the expansions that lie beyond the F2P experience.
---
Haha, that‚Äôs so sad. 
---
Just showing where the JP starts and doing the JP with just jumping and gliding. I did mess up a little on the scaffolding at the end. Those jumps can be tricky; luckily not too punishing if you fall since you can glide.
---
Maul skill should force the enemy to dismount to fix this 
---
Something has to get very screwed up for ESO to redownload the whole game.  That is very much an outlier.  The patches are the same general size as most game patches are these days.  A few gigs at most, for the larger updates.
---
The Life Force cost is also cheaper than Desert Shroud (17% vs 24% of base HP). The only other upside is the group barrier at the end, which is about 6,000 with 1,573 Healing Power.
---
same, sometimes when i get home my body just shuts down
---
Nice! Haha beat me to it on the video upload. Fun puzzle imo.
---
Wouldn't it be nice if they give all accounts a 3 day pass, redeemable within say... 3 months (hopefully to reduce server stress) for sightseeing purposes and tempt players into buying permanent passes whenever they have a new VIP area out? 
---
I already own two permanent passes. Honestly unless they add a Pass Tome or give us a taste of the new areas (without us forking 150gems for the 2 weeks pass), it'll be hard to sell me more passes. I'm sure many players feel the same way. 
---
10k damage on a long cooldown ability with a huge delay that you're only going to reliably land on someone if you're already in their face, *and* you sacrificed your main survival ability to trait for this instead?
---
Yeah, that actually sounds about normal. Could probably use a buff.
---
They've stated that they cancelled all other projects and are focused on gw2. 
---
Do you homework before you speak up next time.
---
All I could think of while waiting for my 50 man queue. Thanks for making this
---
It won't.
---
Will people still be as chill this weekend? 
---
You sound pretty hateful towards everything that's not WvW. Why should anyone listen to you or anyone as spiteful and vindictive as you?
---
Honestly, it's a good thing that we have so many people trying out the game mode, it needed some fresh blood badly. I haven't enjoyed wvw in a long time and even though we were losing most of our fights, I was still having a good time with how intense it was.
---
And those players then feel disenfranchised and realize they owe anet no loyalty.
---
Make a shortcut for gw2‚Äôs exe file. Go into properties and on the ‚Äútarget‚Äù add ‚Äú-repair‚Äù to it, click ‚Äúapply‚Äù and then run it. This shortcut should repair the files
---
Because model animators should be doing other things than what theyre hired to do?
---
They really just wanted to delete that trait without giving anything back.
---
My queue for EB finally popped after an hour, I tried to enter the map, and got the "map is full" message and was placed back at 65 in the queue.
---
I don't think the system works.
---
I couldn't resist haha
---
Edge of the Mists icon got me 
---
My issue is with de-targeting. It sucks to be kiting in PvP, only to propel yourself back to the person you‚Äôre fleeing. Deselecting is easy enough, but sometimes you forget...
---
God yes to this, I remember when I finished getting to 80, I wanted to explore all the maps and heard about these wvw ones, ran on and ended up staying around, it‚Äôs why I was a bit disheartened when I heard they removed wvw from the list of maps to complete 
---
Yeap, right there
---
fixed it! thanks o7
---
Elite specs are vital in wvw though, theirs a reason you don‚Äôt see many people on core specs 
---
If you're that successful, you should just work more instead of playing the game.  Then buy gems and exchange to gold.  That's the most efficient option by far.   
---
Ideally, you should only log in long enough to buy gems and exchange.  Anything else is a waste.
---
Interestingly, it shares the same icon as the Carapace Armor Box.
---
With a majority frontliner zerg, yes.  With a heavy DPS/ranged oriented zerg, no.  The frontliners will still be stacked, but the long range dps always spread out so they aren't easily spiked. Glassier dps builds will get nuked even if they're tight in the zerg fully buffed. They shine spread out.

You being betrayed doesn't change the fact that your opinion is just one in a million and while some people agree with you, apparently there are people who don't who's opinions are just as valid. How were you betrayed? The content I'm getting I'm enjoying. I paid for a game and I'm playing a game.   
---
I didn't buy this game for dungeons, though I enjoy the occasional dungeon. I didn't buy this game for Fractals, indeed Fractals didn't exist when I bought the game. I didn't buy the game for raids, because raids didn't exist in this game until the game was 3.5 years old.
---
I bought the game for demos like the Shatterer demo, or the first time I saw the Shadow Behemoth. I bought this game for the active combat. The cooperative nature of PvE (as opposed to competitive as it is in many games). I bought this game for stuff like collections and legendary weapon crafting, both of which I'm still doing. I actually like the Living World system. It works for me. Partially because if gives me content I can enjoy for weeks on end. I like the new Dwarven Treasure Room mini dungeon and the north and south meta of the new zones. And yeah I get it's not challenging content, but that doesn't mean people don't engage with it.
---
  
---
Your opinion doesn't make you right. It just means you're not getting what you want out of this game. But that doesn't make the game worse. The combat is still good. Mounts are the best implementation I've ever seen in an MMO period end stop.  SAB is coming up at the end of this month, which I love. 
---
You didn't get involved in a bad relationship. You had specific expectations of what a relationship would entail and it didn't live up to those specific standards. You've not been abused. No one set out to hurt you. This is just you personalizing the fact that the game is 6.5 years old and sometimes that affects decisions.
---
What company doesn't try to diversify? What company doesn't invest in R&amp;D? What company doesn't try to expand it's product line. Honestly it's like people live in a bubble. 
---
Is it still a 28 bloodstone crystal limit per character and 35 per account?
---
after you work in the industry for a while you kinda get a feel for when management says they'll do something or have a plan for something is complete BS / smoke and mirrors. Versus saying absolutely nothing for PR. And actually saying they are formulating a plan and that they truly mean it.
---
It [looks like](https://dd.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/axosl2/bug_warclaw_armor_box_has_replaced_carapace_armor/) today's patch overwrote the old Carapace Armor Box completely.
---
you made me laugh with your YEET
---
post your account so we can check how sincere u are cuz im betting youre gone until the next PvE treat anet puts into wvw
---
If only they made this mistake with the lv20(?) scroll instead and merge the two. :/
---
Caught in a landslide...
---
If you don‚Äôt wvw regularly it might take a week or so to get a mount anyway, unless you have some daily WvW  potions saved.
---
Was wvW like this back at launch?
---
I've been doing some wvw over the past month, using it for dailies and slowly working on GoB. And I've dabbled in it a few times in the past. Used to have a small group (around five people) who I'd roam with.
---
Biggest issue for me, that is stopping me from really trying to invest into the mode, is the fact that only three to four specs seem viable. Not quite the players' fault obviously, that's on the balance team, but the last two weeks had people all over reddit and the forums saying that if you play anything but the top four, you're gonna get kicked/raged at/placed in the noob subsquad. It felt demeaning.
---
I ran for about six hours today, the longest I've done in a day. It was a pleasant experience (other than the trolls/elitists in team chat) and it has me curious, but there's a part of me wondering if the comms I joined today only tolerated my ranger bc of the massive influx of players and it'd be impossible to kick them all etc, what will it be like in a couple of weeks?
---
I probably sound super cynical, I'm just that player who spends all of their time on one character, and I'd rather not impede on others if my main is going to screw up their experience somehow. 
---
teaching? lol if only they can take advice and criticism instead of saying "I play what i want".
---
Mostly just open world stuff, HoT metas and PoF bounty trains. Fractals I expect would be helpful too but I haven't done them in ages. 
---
Tbh I'd just join an open squad in wvw, tell them you're learning and most will be understanding and help you out. What wvw server are you on?
---
To be fair vets should remember back when people actually played WvW and queuing was a normal (still slightly annoying) thing lmao 
---
I like this thematically. It‚Äôs like a special use that druids get out of summoning spirits.
---
Unintended. Report and move on.
---
I thought it was originally put in place for when WvW maps were often full.  They really aren‚Äôt queued up to much theses days (prior to Warclaw).  I can see why they neglected it over time.  It always felt like it was full of half implemented ideas though.
---
Wait, what happened?  
---
I‚Äôve played more EotM today waiting for my spot in the queue than I have in years.
---
you dont need to be in squad as a ranger, go solo roaming or roam with a party, that's what your class shines, why tf people want to be in zerg but dont play zerg classes and instead, they play roaming classes?
---
if you really want to invest into wvw, you should be able to play multiple classes, especially in big group.
---
Meanwhile in map chat: "where can i go to afk"
---
Those are mandated breaks, WvW is OSHA compliant.  There are postings near the water cooler that explain the laws.
---
Looks pretty? (useless)
---
Mount speed depends on whose territory you are in so this is completely inaccurate.
---
I just remember that winning in the top slots would give server side benefits and boons. Gave us something to fight for back home. I miss that. 
---
Since when do people bother each other in edge of the mist? It's always been a darn karma train
---
I‚Äôm doing okay, but that‚Äôs why I love being off-meta - enemies typically don‚Äôt know or understand your build and you don‚Äôt usually get burned as bad on patch day. 
---
What's that music :D
---
Rip istan farn
---
Son of butt.. and I just finally finished getting my 250 for aurora yesterday. What a huge pain.
---
More Kormir with the giant neck collar (like [Twilight Arbor dungeon](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Nightmare_Court_armor_(light)). [Kormir Statue Concept Art](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Kormir_god_statue_concept_art.jpg)
---
Have you heard of a mesmer skill called Portal?
---
I was going to vent, but decided to just post this picture just so I don't overreact.
---
No it doesn't, neither do the skills. In PvE you'll have the friendly territory speed, two bars of endurance, the endurance ability and the unupgraded engage ability. In PvE, the PoF masteries apply to the mount.
---
On SBI by 9pm only one map was queued. So I presume most people either ran away screaming or sprinted through whole thing, marked off "have gurgling cat mount now, yay" and went back to PvE, suffer new round of chrono nerfs :( 
---
Once again, a feature no WvW veteran wanted causing unwanted bypassing of defenses and QA once again has proven themselves to be utterly useless...
---
And this is a big deal, inner garrison is usually where the defence happens as outer gets rushed before defences arrive. Bypassing inner means you can rush to lord before a defence can be mounted.
---
For context, im using the P/P unload build from Meta battle. In the training Golem, i can routinely get 6k DPS (with poor rotations) which is much higher than i can get with D/D or Staff (under 5k and 5200 respectively). 
---
I love the D/D gameplay, but i feel like i cant play it without sacrificing a shedload of DPS... 
---
Nah, i view swiftness as mandatory and take that as base. For my defense, i did write that in the text above the table, unless it wasn't well written enough and thus not obvious.
---
Calm down - this will obviously get nerfed. You have to break an egg to make an omelette.
---
ANet: _Huffs_ But people were complaining about everything being so cheap! So we nerf the only thing that non-core accounts seem to be doing! There, feel better sense of rewards and accomplishments next time you get a champ bag!
---
I was in as soon as it started. The amount of veteran commanders giving up on commanding because of all the Pve players was absolutely hilarious. Every time a tag went up then down, I would them "I don't blame you"
---
It was really hard for them, especially the ton of people not listening and getting farmed like crazy.
---
Holy crap... I'm on an NA server and EB was usually 100+ and all the other BL's were 50ish. But damn every BL for EU is 100+
---
I am positive about monetization but I just had to make that joe ;-) 
---
East tower, run to the Garnison and jump down over the hill gate and you are in 
---
At the disadvantage of having to deal with a billion people and infusions burning your retinas. I'll take the minor inconvenience of my lily of the eon to have some peace and quiet. I'd buy the divinities reach one if I could.. That one looks nice and empty. 
---
Thank you so much for the advice it works! 
---
It's not the reward track that is boosted, but WXP.
---
Huge thanks for the spoiler, really appreciate it.
---
Many

Have you tried a rifle? I love D+D but wanted to have some more ranged options, and P+P was boring to me as well so I picked up Deadeye and have enjoyed it. Even if it doesn't stick with you, shaking up your build with new things might make you realize you enjoy another build :3 I know it's far fetched seeing as usually people are like "yeah I've played it all!" But just my suggestion because it might be helpful and fun for you to try something you have not
---
How exactly is it dead? 
---
Apart from the classes, how old is your account compared to your friends? Have they played quite a bit prior to you joining and decided to start over with you?
---
Wait, I didn't think about this but.
---
Mounts are exclusive to PoF, so if you don't have that expansion does that mean you cannot get the warclaw at all?
---
Ouch. 
---
You know what is boring? Waiting 3 months for a map and a story mission you complete within 2 hours.
---
I already miss the swiftness, fury, and stability skills. Pre-stacking at singularities and supporting groups between boss fights, was exactly the kind of "non-passive" gameplay they were supposedly trying to add in this patch. Now I just sit there, and it's boring.
---
In related news, I just discovered that banners trigger the final boss fight on Chaos now. Probably others as well. Awful changes.
---
Except that zerg has the same option to be mounted.
---
&gt; funneling away from GW2
---
&gt; No big projects in the works

You would need  an army of qa testers to launch with 0 exploit spots. These will get ironed out over time. 
---
SO SACRIFICE YOURSELF 
---
AND LET ME HAVE WHAT'S LEFT 
---
Sorry. Breaking Benjamin fan. 
---
Still a useless spoiler tag on a useless post with a useless comment.
---
To be fair the barrier you get is fairly decent and this shouldn't be too much of an issue especially if you are on a support build.
---
Did you check lf requirement of the trait?
---
Btw from abrasive grit trait/rune of sanctuary drama it is very clear they dont have any knowledge of this class and they dont spend more than 2mins testing changes on it. Dont expect too much.
---
Just go full Marauders with Durability runes and go Chrono wells backline. Just watch your positioning.
---
"What the hell are you doing!?"
---
"Shh... just let it happen."
---
That is a lot of siege, but that much isn't necessary, so there's no point. I really don't see that much unusual or bad here? Overpowered: yes. But that's WvW, where numbers count for a lot.
---
This kind of fights are what should be there. If everything is ordered then there is no fun.
---
you can do wvw reward track to get exotic minstrel armors and weapon, farm currencies in living story maps to buy ascended accessories, it will take a while
---
i also highly recommend learning other classes, in your case you should try necro cuz you can use your ascended gear although you will be squishy with full berserker
---
Like some other posters said, I try to log in for the reward but if I'm to tired to play I simply don't.
---
No mmo is worth making yourself sick
---
Great points, I was arguing this very issue today in voice chat on my server.
---
I used to be a pretty hardcore wvw player a long time ago, haven't played wvw for ages though, I was disgusted at the attitude of the so called wvw veterans towards the new players.
---
The 5 minutes I spent using team chat before joining voip almost made me quit wvw again. It was that absurd and disgusting. The insults, the name calling, the down right condescending tone, all towards the pve players. 
---
No WvW Rank or Participation meaning PvE area, but still WvW build/balance? Huh. Doesn't seem right.
---
Ok thanks. I already planned on doing all living world maps next. I know I did the story out of order but I completed original story, world completion, and pof. I was going to start lw and finish hot next but wanted to throw some wvw matches in on certain days to learn. I'm a mesmer junkie but wanted to try necro or thief next.
---
This is gold :-D
---
ANet's advertising is so bad even their own players don't know about wvw and raids lmao
---
Even serious WvWers have been asking for monetizing WvW for a long time. Letting WvW bring ANet money by means other than server transfers means ANet can move away from that system and still bring in money from that playerbase. Other suggestions have included Tower, Guards and Siege skins, and WvW-specific boosters in the BL Store.
---
Sure, people were asking for it. But they should at least fix current bugs that allow to break into various keeps and towers, before introducing this. There was 2 spots to get into Fire Keep lord, 1-2 spots to get into Garrison lord and 1-2 ways to get into Air keep lord on Red Borderland before mount. Can't imagine what's going on now considering how alpine is broken due to mounts. Makes me question QA team a lot.
---
And cavalier weapons price increase in 3,2,1 it now costs 1000g good job op. 
---
This was to be expected üôÑ
---
&gt; Few more ~~trees~~ *happy little accidents* and it would look like a Bob Ross painting.
---
Fixed
---
Price of decor is absolutely horrendous for solo players, especially the average ones. You have to be at least middling rich and capable of maintaining that though TP investments and regular profitable gameplay before you can try getting a decent amount of decor out.
---
I asked the friend I tested with yesterday (they were on druid I was on something else) and yes the elite spirit heal gave them CA.
---
One weird part we noticed from the combat logs was that from the Druid perspective it looked like they were the one giving the healing ("You heal X for 150 using ....") but from my perspective it looked like the spirit itself was healing me ("Spirit of Nature's Renewal heals you for 150 using Natures'Renewal Aura").
---
So I think a big part of the issue come from here: when outgoing it looks liek you are doing the healing, but incmoing it looks like the spirit does and I guess the traits/modifiers/etc proc when the heal is "going inside someone" (have not found a better way to put it yet :p).
---
It's normal instancing like other Lounges, so you'll get players from all matchups. You can access your own team chat from here, though.
---
I do a bit of roaming here and there, but the server I'm on is rather under-populated. It's hard to get into it. I've ran with a few guilds before as well but, same circumstances, not as consistent.
---
Raids kinda fall into that bracket as well, I don't have any teams to do raids with and I don't understand the nuances of how that all works well enough to be able to sit down and pug run them. Social anxiety prevents me from signing up randomly because, as previously stated, I don't understand them all that well.
---
Except Anet always break the eggs, practically never make the omelette, specially for WvW. :/
---
That after 6 Years they STILL don't test their shit, specially in WvW where it was obvious as fuck that putting a mount with a GIANT leap would bring down every spot that was abused before by other jumps to bypass fortifications and then some more, and that they absolutely did not test it isn't normal at all.
---
That after 6+ years Anet STILL doesn't test anything, STILL has no test server, and use Live as their Test Server isn't acceptable. :(
---
Shit like that got discovered in a couple hours ("surprisingly", people did try all the obvious existing or old fixed spots for jumping in exploits, and then will test all those that are/were "i could nearly get in but jumps are slightly not long/hig enough for now"... as expected by anyone with half a neurone working :(, which seems to not exist working at Anet at all :()).
---
ALL it required was a couple days of a WvW test server, open for people with let say &gt; 200h of play in WvW, and 5+h a week in the last 2 weeks, so it wasn't even requiring a big server, just one set of maps, telling people to try to "break" as many things as they could with mounts.
---
It would have been solved.
---
But nope, as usual it's "release first, without any clue of what gameplay really is, of what problems could be, and fix weeks/months later, MAYBE, IF the lonely dev working on WvW has the time someday, and isn't working on something else".
---
It's scary and disrespectful. :(
---
Its not boring! I just quit the game. I only log on once every 3 months for that 2 hours. The game respects my time.
---
6k solo dps sounds kinda on the low side, with my zerk daredevil staff i get over 8k on solo golem without any buffs and that is while using godmode trait (invigorating precision) and while running bas venom for CC and bandits defense for a stunbreak when needed in my skillbar. all while not using food/utility
---
Yes druid is still the go to druid, for meta comps it might switch to tempest(my speculation) but druid is still very very good 
---
Wvwvw will go back to only having viable zerg at peak hours? At least that was the case when expansion launched,  perhaps worse now?
---
I see them used pretty frequently in the T1 and T2 matchups.  And they're pretty effective when they're well coordinated.
---
No actually it isn't.
---
Yu move like a goddamned snail on enemy territory, especially versus hard hitters with tons of mobility.
---
Of course I'm only looking at this from an early day 1 standpoint where mounts aren't all over the place so I understand if people disagree with me.
---
I don't understand why do people complain about this shit all the time. What do you want them to do? Give you a whole new game within 3 months? If you are talking about the things you do with the new content should last longer, there are achievements and side quests and events waiting to be completed no matter if you are interested in them or not. You are playing a fucking mmorpg and they are not releasing a whole new expansion in 3 months. A whole new map with events and 2 hours of "story" should be super good enough for the people. If you are into RPG's, there are tons of them with a good storyline. Stop complaining.
---
It probably is, but the dangers of being mounted with only x amount of health then getting ambushed and knocked off yur mount is still there.
---
Maybe new traps in the future could be fun.
---
Stuff that knocks people off their mounts, tar pit Keep addons which slow mounted units when triggered etc. 
---
Glad to have you on board mate. Ignore the elitists, I freakin' love seeing WvW alive again. See you on the battlefield!
---
Nope
---
&gt; Problem now is the perpetually full BLs and people getting unhappy about WvW newbies flooding in just to get Warclaw and gtfo.
---
Like with everything, give it a week. Then most will have their mount and will have moved on already. This is a reoccurring thing, WvW community complains that nothing is done for WvW and the population is dwindling, ArenaNet does something and there are massive queues, WvW community complains that PvE noobs are blocking the queue.
---
It's still possible to glide into a bunch of enemy objectives, so we're likely looking at 2021 for a fix for this. 
---
Why? If you are to slow in his territory, he runs away.
---
If you engage, he is still on his mount and you cant mount up fast enough. In this case he also runs away. (He still has 2 dodge rolls on his mount).
---
You are in the same scenarios I described in my post.
---
Yesterday I was able to kite a SB#5 spaming thief (this is one of the fastest ways to travel without a mount) in his territory. He had no CD left to kill the mount, it is to fast. The other players in his group (a war and a necro) had no chance to follow me. 
---
Levelled using D/D P/P with the intention of playing staff whilst then levelling deadeye.
---
When I got staff, I was so underwhelmed by the damage and survivability that I switched back without really giving it a chance.
---
By the time I got rifle, I was so used to my set up that I struggled with the idea of using rifle that I haven't really given it a second chance which lead me to P/P unload build. 
---
Maybe I should focus less on numbers and more on fun haha. 
---
ok. Thanks for clarification
---
Do what you love and the...numbers will come? Eh, close enough right
---
I love when people with no actual knowledge of WvW history comes here and say "Relax, they'll fix it!" while I'm sitting here looking at rifle engi exploits into so many structures in this game that have existed since the launch of GW2 in 2012.... hmmmm.
---
That‚Äôs EU t5 at 10pm (at least according to the timestamp on the post) on a weekday evening. Of course it hasn‚Äôt super long queues. 
---
Well, I looked through the log harder and find the limits:
---
There is a limit for every type of entry in the guild log:
---
influence: 100, as is not used anymore the entries are really old.
---
members (invite_declined, invited, joined, kick, rank_change): 100.
---
motd: 25
---
stash: 200
---
And treasury plus upgrade: 150 And this is the reason is not possible to see treasury aportations if you have lots of upgrades. Furthermor, when an upgrade is queued, it generates more entries in the log.
---
Thank you for all the answers ;)
---
Then report those. Often. And if that doesn't help, show everyone (like here) how it's done. Then others will report them too.
---
What I can understand is that ANet prioritizes tickets. It has to. They cannot fix everything we find. And we have part in how those bugs are prioritized. If a bug is really only exploited once in a long while, then even if it mean capping a keep this isn't going to be high on the priority list. At the same time it is highly annoying for every WvW player of course. Do you have a better suggestion out of this than to make those bugs known, so that the problems they cause are also known, especially to ANet?
---
I mean it's more of a daily Istan now since the chests are limited. I'd say AB meta is still good (can even just stop by to lot chests), TD meta is good, ofc silverwastes is still good for repeated farming (and stacking MF if you were going to open unided)
---
If you mine the whole map and do the dailies and a few meta events you hit get more than 28 on a single character.  Idk about the cap tho
---
One meow to rule them all
---
I am also wondering if it has something to do with who made the warclaws
---
Yep, it's embedded in [this post](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/prepare-for-battle-with-the-armistice-bastion-pass-and-war-torn-chest/).
---
You STUPID moron it DOES AFFECT YOU.        
---
Why? Because prices will skyrocket and YOU gonna spend WAY more gold to get T6 and other materials. If YOU need some fast gold YOU could go to istan and get some good gold/hour, now it's gone.
---
Can you see it now? Special snowflake.
---
I love the old music too. So epic and memorable.
---
Over the years [I've suggested](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/6scwez/a_missed_opportunity_over_5_years_of_balancing/) a few times to buff the no-offhand skills in a way that they're an option, and not just wasted opportunities that are used for 15 minutes while leveling. Suggestions got buried each time, main argument is that the lack of an offhand doesn't only remove 2 skills but also the weapon's stats, making it unbalanceable.
---
Well your comment clearly showcased you actually don't know what you're talking about so that's where my pompous assumption comes from. Clearly you do not know about these things. Not because you don't see it yourself being abused makes it non-existant. 
---
And yes, these exploits have been reported over the years. Same for hackers, I love seeing the same person for over a year, be able to flyhack a golem around EBG. This is why I say you don't know what you're talking about - you open by telling people to calm down and then say the coverage on reddit is gonna fix it... 
---
You are right though that to get things changed in GW2, you need to make a fuss on reddit ;)
---
Just wondering, what bad memories could you possibly have from beta? 
---
This makes me so sad, love me some power chrono and having that bit of fun timing with the SOE after cast was a big part of that, something that actually affected your dps in a huge way and skill became a factor rather than just following a to do list. So satisfying when you got it right and see the mental illusion/clone spam, damaging but not devastating when you missed it. Rest in peace
---
It's just a matter of time before this becomes meta, and we start skipping mechanics everywhere. When this bug isn't fixed, and everyone has mounts (compared to not everyone able to make the leap on foot/portal/etc) then there's no reason for the inner gate to even exist.  
---
I'm with the majority of the comments: It's not the mount's fault. It's ANet for not testing this properly and the fact that this was discovered in a matter of only a few hours just makes it worse.
---
Which server will the guilds move to avoid queues?
---
Play before work!
---
I don't think the SW reward track is repeatable
---
&gt; You're clueless with regards to how WvW mechanics influence the gameplay. Spreading out doesn't ever make you tankier or survive better.
---
That's just how it used to be. Spreading out can now prevent the wipe the OP was talking about, so finally there is some other tactic than everyone hugging each other. I think this is good.
---
Since you didn't mention Always Land on Your Feet, you might have only attemped it in Tyria? I saw people complaining about it, but I got it first try by falling to my death (by accident) off the citadel on home borderlands.
---
How about getting titles. God of pvp or Best of the best ?
---
dude you forgot the guide for Savage Scholar.
---
To be honest, you shouldn't have been happy in the first place. Anet renaming Ice Bow to Frost Bow was a huge nerf this balance patch. I don't think anyone ever called it Frost Bow in the first place! [Devs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fK1N_vqJPac) themselved also called it Ice Bow! It would have made more sense renaming the skill rather than the object. Anyone that actually used this skill when it was relevant will likely continue to call it Ice Bow anyway.  ¬Ø\\\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Can you post your build? Sounds interesting.
---
Easy...they fired ones on the wvw team that knew that.
---
$20, since you can‚Äôt buy less than 800 gems at a time. 
---
Druid+Chrono is still the main support duo, the last LW expansion made Renegade+FB a viable alternative for experienced teams
---
Oouff. I can't play at the moment and I'm afraid I it will get almost impossible to unlock it after most people have it since I'm never where the fight is going to be. 
---
WTF
---
Eh, I leveled up a mesmer as my first character and while I had easier time with my necro (maybe I also got a bit better at the game?) the core game is pretty easy so no class should have issues.
---
&gt;  This might happen or it might not; it might take a week or half a year, we just have to wait and see. Probably we should shout the louder the longer it takes.
---
Well then I do not understand why you opened with telling people to calm down. And I'm personally done with the "wait and see" mindset as I've been burned too many times to count. 
---
Proper QA would be priority to me then clearer attention to reports and retraining of people who handle those reports. Those are the suggestions I'd have as an outside (as I don't actually know the inner workings of the company besides tidbits of info either shared publicly or leaked)
---
The difference is that the GW2 ping system is only 2D on the minimap. If it was a 3D ping like in Apex, then it would be just as useful, but as it is, it is clunky to use.
---
So I've tried it in game. Yes you can't abuse the after delay, but if you cast CS at the start of an SOE cast with quickness, you can still unleash your entire kit of phantasms with time to spare and SOE will be reset by split.
---
I think this is more a PVP nerf than a PVE nerf since you can't unleash your army with just one clone, you'll need more clones. Since you'll normally be running Chronomphantasma, clones don't summon as fast.
---
I think Power dps chrono will have a weaker opening dps but will stay relatively the same
---
I knew this was going to be an issue as soon as they made mention of a mount coming to wvw with a long jump. 
---
Tbh you never know, just keep on checking main store page for updates , and usually if anyone notice a sale someone in reddit will post it, so keep an eye on this reddit too.
---
Cheers
---
sneak gyro is just dumb...
---
At least before you had an idea where they were.
---
I did my mesmer leveling this year. Wasn't bad tbh, GS skill 4 usually brings most random enemies to under 1/2 health and the clones distract so well that you can handle many situations without even getting to the melee range.
---
I agree that mounts will make leveling up 10 times better, I immediately grabbed the raptor when I hit 80 for the first time. That said, I don't really like the idea of using the level 80 boost for the first character, you'll build a much better foundation for your skills when you learn the game mechanics "the hard way".
---
At least I personally feel *really* lost with a class if I just go to PvP lobby and am handed all the skills and traits.
---
I've tried to get around them in PvE (and have some), but never tried in PvP so wasn't sure.  Not the most glamorous of fixes, but it's probably the easiest at a guess.
---
Before the patch symbol pulse damage had a 0.5 scaling.
---
After the patch but before hotfix symbol pulse had roughly a 1.0 scaling (which was not reflected/intended in the patch notes nor in hte late notes)
---
After the hotfix scaling seems to be back to 0.5 so it is indeed really a bug fix (why this happened is still weird but that's what happened).
---
&gt;I don't want to be that negative person, really! But the interest boost for wvw is a thing that lasts only a very limited amount of time. Unless something bigger (eg tournament) is right around the corner I'm sure population will fire down to almost normal levels within a month.
---
Yes, but that's beside the point. Some people don't really like the game mode, they won't be sticking around in it no matter what you do. So you don't need to target them. You need to make the changes that make WvW better for those who play it. Having some incentives for other players to dip into the mode (and occasionally find they like it) is good to have, but shouldn't be a focus.
---
mwhahaha
---
There used to be a time where people didn't need skinner box rewards to enjoy games! I make my own fun. Like PvP and grinding Achievement points!
---
The XPacs are going on sale so often lately, that of you wait a bit more, you will have more than single opportunity to get it before the end of Spring
---
I'll just wait a week or two, like I do with all releases.
---
didn't die, just feels really bad now. and alacrity is literally AIDS
---
I hope they bring back the original Guild Wars soundtrack leitmotif at the very end battle in Guild Wars 2
---
Probably totally doable since we have the system to place squad markers in 3D space at the location of the mouse cursor
---
Your brain I guess
---
complain of being bored but is spec'd to use long attacks that keeps him safe from the action...riiiiiiiiiight haha
---
We've been able to do with both targeting (marker on objects) and the various squad command markers for many years now.   
---
Plus it's been used in far older games anyway, such as the Battlefield series.
---
Good old times 
---
I do WvW here and there, but mostly pve. WvW is great, way better than what it was at the beginning but yesterday made me realise I really need to change server, I don't know about other servers than Mer De Jade, but there are so many toxic people in this server. It really makes the WvW experience bad. 
---
You don't need to be support/defensive player. If you are good at bursting you can pick off important targets like revenants. There are focus parties just gathered to do stuff like this.
---
Yep. Kinda the point of my post... Not sure what you're adding? Perhaps give me an idea of a more interesting build?
---
It sucks but it makes sense to nerf Istan.
---
I just miss the original pre expansion login screen, I am even starting to miss the HoT one. I'm so sick of the PoF one
---
Also, don't bother with ascended. Exotics are super cheap and will do just fine. Only upgrade to ascended if you really enjoy it and when you are sure about which stats you want.
---
&gt; in some raids
---
OH, you just talking about raids, the content that is only played by a small minority of the player base. Why should they balance classes around 10 man content if so little 10 man content is offered and even less play it?
---
Yes. With enough healing they stay infinitely and you can use their active skills as much as you want. At some point the skills reset to the summon ones though, so I'm not sure if that's intended? But even then, the old ones only ie once new ones have been summoned, so there's no downtime.
---
Raids forever probably but in fractals, I would personally prefer to have a Firebrand or the new tempest with me. They bring equal/better stuff for a 5man grp. 
---
you even suck at venting
---
I'm all about the support Scrapper at the moment. I'm pretty sure people are getting annoyed with me constantly plugging it here.
---
A dedicated healing build has fantastic numbers, or can condi cleanse like a pro. I run mostly healing cause I love seeing all the green numbers. Pop on your med kit, stand on top of the tag, people around you will receive lots of healing. No real rotation to worry about until you want to get a little more consistent with blast finishers, but those are hardly the meat and potatoes anyway.
---
I have been recommending it to everyone lately. Simple to play, solid healing / cleanse numbers. Works wonderfully in any group 5+, I think it shines in zergs though.
---
Problem is wvw community never wanted a mount at first place...
---
Is this an insider I dont get? I mean sure, "chrono ded" but the fuq is that image even supposed to be?
---
It can be used outside of wvw it, tldr read patch :D
---
I don't know I'd sure like to believe it... Could you please point me towards where you've read that? 
---
From what I've seen they've only stated there are some familiar faces coming back to work on GW2, but I'm certain part of the team is already getting started on a new project - a less ambitious one however. There's no source I've read that even implies GW2 is getting more focus than it did previously. The only commitment made was towards the already planned out and announced releases. 
---
GW2 wasn't worth their undivided attention in the past and it won't be in the future. It's an old game by now - although it's still making them money for sure. However there's not much potential for growth and it has long lost its appeal to the gaming market by and large - outside of the niche western MMO genre. They won't get that back without making considerable investments (engine, performance, graphics, exciting new content and MARKETING). I just don't see it happening.
---
If I was cynical I'd expect that once the new project takes shape devs will secretly be moved off of GW2 again. But I don't mind whatever their plans are outside of GW2. A considerable part of the team will keep working on GW2 for quite some time and probably for now they're more reliant on its performance. We'll  just have to wait and see what arises from it. More gemstore stuff or something worthwhile?
---
Yeah, that sounds sensible. Thanks. 
---
PS: Dulfy rocks!
---
Why wouldn't you want to have the mount?
---
It is a mount, it looks great and many just want to have it. All of the mounts are situational but you see many just running around on their favourite one. Now you got a big cat in battle armour to run around.
---
EREBOR !
---
It didn't really turn out well, did it?  
---
Not saying I agree with that other guy, but you're not really making a strong case for your cause with that example  
---
for completions sake or because it looks kewl
---
&gt; Then report those
---
wvw glide has been abused since its release, people have been posting about it, guilds have been abusing it.
---
&gt; Calm down - this will obviously get nerfed
---
You dont know that, even if it's fixed, when ?1 week ? 3 months ? 2 years ?
---
Congratulations, mate. Your journey has only just begun.

&gt;why so many PvEers actually want the mount.
---
There is no new things to do right now in PvE.
---
Players expecting to get things done much easier when map population mixed with PvE players instead of pain trains.
---
There is 100% wxp buff.
---
My first thought when I saw the post, the image it-self just brings the damned song to your head, good ol' memories.
---
Yeah, just like the new pvp team arena, gated behind 1k gems, this is getting ridiculous
---
Warclaw in PvE has no value compared to all the other mounts.
---
Everybody knows that the true endgame of GW2 is fashion
---
The problem is that the mount goes up while leap skills on professions usually stay just above ground. Engineer's traited Rocket Boots can't make the jump, I tested it A LOT.
---
Put a tiny invisible wall in the air on mount's path. Put it high enough to obstruct the mount and not block LOS for people on the walls. Easy solve.
---
It's just really annoying that there is a chance that you have a chance to get not a single piece of map-specific mined resources.. from when.. I think it was LS3? Onwards. I don't understand why they don't just reduce the number of nodes if they're so concerned players get too many of them.
---
Sure, Kappa 
---
You can use them for those, but they're nowhere near as flexible or easy to use. And they miss the audio cues, which the minimap pings have.
---
it's unique feature is that it's usable in WvW
---
I mean.. You wanna 1v1 me as a base class with me using Elite Specs? We can find out if he's wrong if you'd like. lol
---
quick, nerf Istan farm, wait ... **√®_√©**
---
They are working, but not enough for Anet/NCSoft throw money away on projects that failed. The whole situation could be different if instead of focusing on new projects Anet could have focused on GW2, but the gaming community also doesn't help, most of the gamers these days are desperate for new games.
---
pay to get a chance to pay for more skins ü§î
---
While not real VR right now it is quite possible on a few things like indoor cycling etc when paired with a powermeter. Same for running.  
---
In fact, the step to real VR is not that much of a stretch anymore.
---
They should make the maul skill dismount hit enemies, or the siege skill be able to be attached to a mounted enemy in order to throw them off their mounts. Right now, roamers will be generally in disadvantage against mount enemies.
---
Weird, people are saying mount is still visible just the player is stealthed.
---
My personal issue with all those titles and legendary skins is that how actually little it drags my attention when I meet someone with any of those. Most of the time I won't pay any at all, and won't remember a guy after a minute. Extremely rarely I may stop to give a quick glance if a guy did really manage to build up some good look which includes it - but then I'll forget about him in 10 minutes anyway.
---
So I can't help myself but assume it's about like most of other peoples actually react to such things as well, and it's kinda lowers value of those for me to such degree it become not worthy my time.
---
Some of us actually look for good fights (even when it's a gank), and actually engage in 1vX fights trying to fight entire groups. Losing this part of the game is limiting it to commander-stacking groups of your typical zerg classes throwing stuff at each other and butchering roaming professions.
---
This is true for Fractals but wrong for Raids.
---
Druid remains Metahealer for now
---
Stop. Crying.
---
Not worth it. It's slower than raptor/jackal and you can't use any of the mastery abilities. If you don't plan to wvw or RP with it I'd say don't waste your time.
---
50 is definitely lowballing it. I was online yesterday,max I saw was around 100 +. And it was a constant stream of 70-90 Q's as well. Lol.
---
Yeah, let's balance classes around Tequatl instead.
---
Vip ¬£¬£¬£ wvw area
---
Old rotation
---
Opening with timewarp cs tot and:
---
Double wells old rotation
---
Putting double wells inside cs but not soi
---
Having 2 clones and putting double wells and soi inside cs
---
The non-instant alacrity application is terrible regardless of what you do.
---
it
---
is
---
a
---
cat
---
if this is not enough for you to spend a couple of night in wvw ignore it.
---
Discounted by 20% to cost 1600 with original price being 2000.  Normally.
---
Druid boon uptime got severely nerfed in the this patch. You can no longer upkeep protection on the group in a 5-man setting.  This is a huge loss for fractals, especially as the instab rework added a lot more incoming damage and protection became almost mandatory. The frost spirit can be easily taken by a dps soulbeast, allowing you to keep its utility.
---
Any other healer can probably replace druid easily, although firebrand has access to a lot of damage prevention in his toolkit, making it my go to choice. In this setup the chrono can be replaced by a renegade, not forcing ppl to stand on wells, and usually outperforming chrono in pugs.
---
Tempest was already viable and has a lot of defensive utility. It was already viable though rarely seen. As for scourge, I know other ppl love it but, personally I think it doesn't perform so well in a single healer setup. A lot of barrier, might, some utility in projectile negation, but not many boons. I cannot precise about heal scrapper as I don't have any experience with it, but I believe it stands close to heal tempest as it has a lot of defensive utility, but lower healing output.
---
It's just the angry state of mind I found myself in while testing out rotations
---
It makes going for lazy WvW dailies faster so my gift of battle/exclusive armor tracks will be more confortable to do :p
---
do i have to complete or just start the collection before i finish the reward track? because i bought a bunch of keys for the battle hardened kits and completed 3/4 of the reward track after i spent 1 point in the warclaw skill section, but i have only the warclaw emblem towards the collection. 
---
i'm now scared that doing the collection will finish the reward track before i complete the collection.
---
Coz in gw1 I found Lorna's pass really hard, difficult and frustrating. So first thing that popped up
---
Yes, it's worth getting. Although it's worse than other mounts in PvE, it looks cool and is easy to get. That's enough.
---
It's hilarious roamers pretend it was "risky" when every ganking build has no chance of losing AND can reset with impunity.
---
Ganking people from zergs that run back is the same as zergs running over roamers. It requires no skill and is just done to get some free bags. 
---
It's pretty useless in pve but it's worth getting only for the sweet AP, I hit 20k thanks to it last night
---
Or just a wall that allows everything but the mount to pass 
---
Probably the best reply I've seen in regards to this issue.
---
Extra healthpool, UnCC-able, fast as (or faster) than a person on foot with swiftness in any territory, especially with the leap, INSTA-FUCKING-STOMP?!?
---
This is literally the last thing wvw needed, and Anet forces it on us.
---
Apart from all the issues with map exploits and such, they do such a half assed, quarterly balance patch that kills classes or breaks them, with some classes being completely ignored forever.
---
Ghost thief for example - Terrorized wvw for years with no change. As soon as it solo clears some raid boss it gets nerfed. 
---
You can math that out.
---
SB #5 is 900 u range, takes about half a second to reach the target, effective range due to arrow travel time thus is around 700 u. You can cast one every five seconds due to initiative cost.
---
Thief with Swiftness and casting SB #5 "on cooldown" travels 5x392 u + 700 u in one five second window. Therefore, his actual move speed amounts to 532 u/ s.
---
A thief doing this in his own territory is able to more or less keep up with enemy players on mounts and can catch up a little bit by using teleports such as Shadowstep and Steal. But he'll also be starved of initiative, which he needs to keep up the pace, so all you have is SB #1 to wittle down the mount's health.
---
If we assume average hits of 1.5k per auto attack of the bow, it'll take the thief around seven seconds to dismount the enemy player while being conservative with his initiative.
---
More like slaughter. Lol. 
---
Rifle with the right traits is a very strong singke target dmg option, especially if you do world bosses.
---
It is a bit tricky to use but eventually you put 10-15k out without any further buffs from others.
---
As far as raid goes, druid might still make part of meta setups, however it now depends a lot more on the chronos for protection and off-group fury generation. Storm spirit active skill got severely nerfed, so unless you need vuln or 10-man fury, it's not worth taking it for cc. The spirits can be very easily healed and take very little damage outside in pve. Any healer will be able to keep them up, so as long as you have a soulbeast you can drop the druid. 
---
Power soulbeast can happily take a spirit without much of a dps loss, and condi soulbeast is happy taking sun spirit instead of a trap (especially in a d/t build as you get more value from the spirit active skill). Taking two spirits is a bit more of a dps loss, but it's still worth it if you have several power and condi classes on your squad.
---
As for healers, the same for raid applies. Firebrand is a very strong healer when coupled with an alacrity revenant, tough most boons are for 5-man.  Herald can easily keep protection, regen, fury, 12 might, and swiftness on the whole squad, while also provinding some alacrity,  When adding its healing output, herald is a very strong choice for pugs. 10-man auras make tempest an interesting support choice, with a lot of access to boons and offering some boon extension which can be godly in pugs/training runs. As for scrapper, again I don't have experience with it, so i'll let others comment. "Heal" scourge works extremely well in raids when coupled with another healer, tough in a single healer setup it suffers from the same problems as in fractals. The barrier can help you safely bypass mechanics while the res potential can easily save the squad from a wipe. 
---
Yeah so many fun things based on CC that you don't get to use in any pvp
---
What do you mean its standard when they add "content" to WvW. Intended or not, it's there every single time. 
---
When they added desert bl you could jump into pretty much every objective. When they added gliding you could glide into quite a few objectives. When they added HoT you could leap into a whole bunch of objectives. 
---
And if you're creative and good at jumping puzzles, warclaw lets you bypass several walls too. Garri and bay are prime examples. 
---
Lets be honest Anet put the Warclaw in PvE so people don't bitch and moan about content being locked behind a game type.
---
What's your point?
---
there is even an achievement where u have to make it sit on pc keyboard in rata sum, use claws on pale tree and other cats stuff.
---
perfection. 
---
Not sure if that counts as a bug,  but here we go.
---
The spirit skills will eventually reset to 'summon spirit x' if you keep the spirits alive long enough. Meaning the alive spirit will be up and doing its thing, while the skill allows you to summon a new one, not to use the exsisting one. Upon using the reset summn skill, a new spirit will spawn and the old one will die. Circle starts again.
---
Woah hold up. 
---
&gt;(PTR, public test realm)
---
They have this but they...as you say 
---
&gt;PTR is not for bug fixes or bug testing.
---
So what is that "TEST SERVER" and "TEST GROUP" for then? Picking their nose? 
---
Please don't talk about something you have no information about, bugs can appear in game or in the network, some bugs in the game won't appear until the network is under massive load. 
---
To say a testing environment and public testing groups do aboslutely zero testing of any kind is incredibly wrong, you literally proved yourself wrong in 1 sentence.
---
We tested the new Harbinger Shroud. First the tooltip has still the 7 Pulses from the sandshroud in it. Furthermore it states that it corrupts 2 boons. 
---
We tested the following it with Shades or just with the necro alone. Boons dont get corrupted
---
There is a fine difference between ganking a single new player who does not know what he/she is doing and multiple zerglings who should actually be aware of their surroundings. You sound like the average butthurt necro forum warrior tbh.
---
I've been pretty report-happy in the last couple of days. 
---
I absolutely have no time in my life for people who throw out homophobic and transphobic abuse in map chat, or for people who tell people alt+f4 is the shortcut for the WvW menu, or for people who think "go on fucking google" is the appropriate response to a question. 
---
I had fun in WvW and I will probably go back, but there was more nasty, pointless bitterness in WvW map chat than in the PUG-iest raid group you could ever hope to find. 
---
At the hidden achievement with WarClaw we are suppose to use our WarClaw to sit in a box next to blue and yellow cat commanders . Those boxes are there but still inside a non mountable area. Thus not able to been finished. 
---
I see, thanks. I'll keep it in mind for when I get to it.
---
Why not? If you have time for it, go for it
---
it's not and compared to the Ls3 currencies, the Ls4 ones give much much less VM. they really didn't want people to save up this currency
---
If it was a bug, it should‚Äônt have been there in the first place so don‚Äôt bitch about it.
---
It is cool ;)
---
Man, seeing that animation with the main theme triumphantly blaring in beta and realising that Guild Wars 2 was *finally* here was nothing short of magical.
---
All dps builds work there tbh.
---
Which LS maps are deserted exactly? Any LS (at least s4 ones, haven't been to s3 maps lately) map I've hopped in has allways had plenty people for metas. Bounty trains aren't too uncommon either.
---
I always join Zergs and im a massive noob and no one noticed.
---
all you need to know is:
---
\-always build rams or whatever the commander drops.
---
\-people who drop movement speed buffs are always appreciated
---
\-always get stuck in in fights, if you suck at pvp just play a build that drops a bunch of aoe damage or buffs at a distance
---
The new heal and sneak gyros are sweet. 
---
You can still stack up  a good 15 odd seconds of stealth.
---
Team wise it has taken a bit of a hit but is still useful in fights especially if you become a target. 
---
It's especially nice now with pistol pistol. 
---
You can mitigate it by being mounted yourself and evading their pounce. But in practice no one would engage if that's the case and fights will be very stale. Also, if you spread out you might not receive ally heals but are in range of enemy damage.
---
We are the QA
---
If you can handle yourself surely you'll be able to be aware of your surroundings without a huge mobility advantage letting you choose engagements only when they're in your favour. In my experience it's not the zerging servers in T1. It's the "roaming" servers who 5v1 anyone then disengage ASAP the moment something hits them.
---
You sound like the average deadeye begging anet to buff ACs because zergs take their towers. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. 
---
They made the warclaw exactly for players like you. Plebs that have no interest in even fights and prefer gimmicks to delude themselves they're not complete trash.
---
Pretty sure they wanted a meaningful balance patch and leaping into objectives fixed.
---
The mount only brought more combat imbalance and more ways to jump inside objectives.
---
How dare they feel unhappy...
---
Took a while before another dead chrono post appeared. 
---
Man I loved this login screen! Why was is it replaced with the launcher in the first place?
---
Huh. Would be nice, I remember sitting around for half an hour one time waiting for that to start to no avail.
---
And what if a player wanted to jump off there... the wall would stop them. 
---
At the moment it's mainly for the looks, especially if you like the upcoming skins that were data-mined. The only real advantages that it has over other mounts in PvE is that it has the strongest engage skill in terms of damage because of the bleed, and that it has the highest HP. 
---
The extra damage is not a lot though and you will probably find CC engages more useful, unless the enemy is immune to CC. The extra HP is not good for avoiding dismounts because mobility is better for that and you can use bond of life anyway. Only time when the extra HP may come in handy is if you have to go afk for a minute and mount up just in case you aggro something while away. So overall, it's not very useful utility wise in PvE.
---
I adore your paint skills, but if you'll ever want to make decent quality flowchart, use https://www.draw.io/
---
That's beautiful.
---
Ah yes. I remember I was so fully of joy, after years of waiting for a full on Guild Wars sequel! 
---
Then I was disappointed. 
---
Who could've predicted the amount of exploits the mount would bring? Oh wait
---
Trust me, there's plenty of ways to build them and play them incorrectly.. I've seen too much bs on forums and in game when gear/build check was available. 
---
The level 80 boost gear is okay, but you can get better stuff for relatively little money on the trading post. 
---
First thing: try to get the hero points to unlock your elite specs. Hero points from HoT and PoF maps are worth ten 'normal' hero points each, so that's a place to start. Warning: the expansion content is harder so don't worry if you struggle at the start. 
---
Metabattle is a website with recommend builds and gear and they're almost always good, especially for raiding. If you can't get the exact gear, get some near-enough gear and a set of near-enough runes. While you do need decent gear, raids are more about how you play than what you wear. 
---
Try out fractals. They're shortish dungeons with good rewards and are fairly popular. If you say you're new to them, someone will normally try to help you learn what to do. Fractal bosses are also good practice for raids as they often have an easier version of similar mechanics. 
---
I hate the gem store just let me pay you a sub. 
---
It's just a knight rank, so a wvw newbie. It could easily have rare gear or something worse.
---
Yeah I was in LA when I spent the point and nothing happened.  Hopefully I can just reset my points and redo it?
---
That's some nice happy little clouds, give it some more happy little trees and it could be a Bob Ross painting :)
---
It's a new mount.
---
We love Mounts in this game. Funny how that works.
---
Nobody wanted them, now we can't get enough of them.
---
I'm a pve player, but I also used to play wvw a lot.
---
I see the warclaw as a chance to revive wvw.
---
Despite the negativity towards it.
---
In the end I believe we will all love it.
---
Oh did I send countless emails to exploits@arena.net with videos of people (and of me included) breaking into keeps thorough the years.
---
Nothing changed. And now they introduced even more exploits.
---
Anet said that its was more secure having a launcher than the login screen. 
---
Stealth plus 3 evades. Invisible zergs engaging from beyond sight range. If they cut the burst movement down or remove the stealth it would do a lot to make it counter-playable
---
Neither. Because each new balance patch forces a new standard of optimal gear. I've had to change gear on my chrono at least 10 times since Heart of Thorns.
---
Can you report this if you're in game.  This is a very niche case situation but someone can abuse it. I know I would have been tempted had I not got the mount. 
---
It's a battle Royale game of course they think it's the best thing in the world, it innovates in so many ways. /s
---
On the other hand, gw2 cannot do anything right in their eyes. Bunch of fuckers and pretenders I tell yah.
---
It's all about socially acceptable bullshit as usual with these brain dead zombies man. 
---
Doesn't even have the 100% exp and the guild reward track buff doesn't apply... despite the map being under the wvw pannel.
---
Well this is much easier than the guardian greatsword or lightning hammer leap.
---
This (build)[http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vZAQFAUnsMBNOhFOBuFDUGjlWCjvZmN3mbHqoTiSLAEi+AA-jRBBABVq+DW7PK/C4BAcmSQAuAAAA-e] is the one i would recommend
---
About it: 
---
- i highly recommend reading the traits and skills so it is easier to understand.
---
- generally: mark your target -&gt; kneel -&gt; push your malice to 7 with 3x three round burst -&gt; use a stealth skill -&gt; use the death judgement (stealth rifle AA skill) -&gt; *repeat*
---
According to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7381g5/research_indepth_mount_speed_tests/), it's slower than a Skimmer on land, but faster than a running Griffon in terms of base speed.  
---
But yeah,  as everyone said, it's purpose remains in WvW, outside of that.. it's just a nice looking mount.
---
I miss the login music.
---
With PoF main theme one feels that is going to a vacation  to the desert, not going to fight a GOD  
---
Same here, the whole warclaw thing for pve players is worth for the AP and you may get some extra AP from the wvw competitive tab. 
---
Join a WvW guild!
---
Hmm okay what about the revenent is he any good?  I found a build on metabattle it looks interesting its called power shiro
---
Those were the days ... 
---
I do WvW on an off, but I do not consider myself a WvW "player".
---
I got lucky and managed to get into an enemy borderland just after patch. Raided with the open zerg for 6 hours after which I had finally unlocked the mount.
---
So there's your time average. 6 hours of decent zerg fights and capturing objectives.
---
Necro does not have smooth gameplay like daredevil. Its rough but gets every job done, eventually. I use it whenever im hard stuck somewhere but in open world its really difficult to get hard stuck sooo.
---
That build... lol
---
Well put.  Thank you!
---
I live my character but yeah, major pain in my ass.
---
its only cause you suck at it 
---
[O\_O](https://i.imgur.com/K3UJx5m.gif)
---
Both are boosted. 100% WXP and 25% RT.
---
What happened by they way to rule 1? Nice work mods :) 
---
Have you tried /sit in there? Maybe no mount needed?
---
erm go look up Path of Exile it gets what GW2 considers expansions every 3 months so yes a good dev team can do that and that game is 1000x more complicated. takes years for Anet to buff or nerf anything unless it becomes extremely easy to farm something in which they will update the next day because guess what they want you to spend real money in the cash shop not grind it with gold. 
---
Blinds, evades, kiting from range.
---
erm they havnt fixed similar exploits that have been in the game since launch heck some made even worse so no they wont fix them and that is why youve shown you dont know the WvW game mode
---
'Walls' that block only the mounts seem like they already can exist - think about the region borders that knock you off your glider instantly. Just add those all over...
---
no, anet would be sued into oblivion.
---
People really have to calm down, its just a bug and not the end of the world, just wait a few days and it will be fixed.
---
It was hard at first, especially coming from Necro, two health bars and stuff, but I guess I just learned when to dodge stuff.  
---
Also those early days before HoT I played d/d death blossom/signet of malice build which gave both a lot of healing and dodge frames.  
---
I think Thief really teaches you how to use mechanics like dodge to your advantage.
---
No one talks about minor bugs or things that are unexpected. 
---
1) Everyone said, you cant have aoe damage leaps it will busts whole zergs with the right amount of mounts. They still did it.
---
2) Everyone said, you cant have leaps that are different than your movement skills because it will break the territory.
---
3) Everyone said you can't allow mounts to engage freely with 12k life buffer without even being cced, you still can. 
---
These 3 alone are the fucking most obvious ones and all of them are in the game right now. Stop using your general excuses for every mistake they make. Yes, there are bugs you can't expect from the get to, but some you can 100%
---
Only if it can take walls in one hit.
---
Apparently warclaw intention was going back to zerg faster, lets make objectives redundant as well since mirage/warclaw cant jump into every objective atm.
---
Daredevil uses a staff in melee üòÇ I‚Äôve seen it in open world and it‚Äôs maddddness lol. My little ranger had to rescue the guy repeatedly. 
---
how was it gw2 fault that the other 2 projects got canceled though?
---
it generated money. the dev werent capable. that was the problem. not that gw2s business plan was bad. it wasnt and it isnt. it generates money.
---
Or here's a crazy idea, let people play the content they want to play how they want to play it.
---
Idk I remember wall jumping eastern plaguelands to what would become the blood elves region. And it was empty and ugly.
---
I'm complete opposite, my level 80 Thief is sitting there whilst I'm going through the story with my necro, I also got another lvl 80 asura necro just sitting there, staring, collecting birthday present with the thief
---
Seems to be a pretty common bug. This is the 5th or so video of it I‚Äôve seen in addition to someone in my guild posting screenshots of it happening to him.
---
&gt; While that remains true, you actually just need one (1) single person with ambitions to climb everything. That would get most of the really obvious things fixed for release.
---
Me too, I always do this in EVERY game I play. 
---
I've farmed tons of LWS3 currency and the drop rate is (was) about the same for petrified wood, though I guess that's offset by heart vendors.
---
But they‚Äôre literally an armor, there‚Äôs nothing underneath 
---
I got the *vast* majority of mine from map completion with alts and from heart vendors.  Which is probably working as intended.
---
WvW abilities don't transition, so yes it is intended.
---
It's a wvw mastery, not a pve one.
---
What alternative?
---
All the tactics with which you could engage the enemy zergs are now reduced to "have all your players on warclaw pounce on them first" 
---
Don't listen to the naysayers, Mesmer is a joy to level up. Mes was my first character so it's been a long time since I levelled it, but if you want to choose a first specialisation, I'd actually recommend Inspiration - Medic's Feedback and Warden's Feedback allows you to get a huge amount of reflect uptime, without sacrificing utility slots for feedback + mimic - you just need a focus, and ideally a dead NPC or something, though a friend who sucks at the game works too. 
---
Focus 4 is the best skill in the game, and you should abuse it - it's a good movement speed buff, a nice reflect if traited, and the flip skill "Into The Void" is superb at pulling a bunch of mobs into a neat little stack for you to cleave with your sword. Play around with it and get a feel for the pull range - it's pretty damn long. 
---
Sword has been hit with the nerf boulder, but it's still utterly mandatory - good autoattack, a nice gap- closer with the sword 3 flip skill, and low cooldown evade frames that also does respectable damage. Consider Dueling as your second traitline, to lower sword cooldowns and give you a free clone when you dodge.
---
Your other weapon set is up to personal taste, and the situation you're in - I carry two swords, a focus, a torch and a Greatsword and switch them in if they're useful. I'd say the most helpful one for levelling is a Greatsword as a ranged option; purists will say if you're not in melee range, you're doing it wrong and that a ranged weapon is a crutch, but like, you're level 30 and they're toxic. GS has a cleaving beam autoattack (if there is a group of mobs running at you, target the one furthest away to catch them all), a respectable DPS phantasm, a knockback, and GS2 is a clone generator that stacks might on allies when it bounces - use this as you close the gap to your target, then switch to sword. 
---
You just wanted specialisation info so I'll get off the soapbox soon...ish, but for basic and useful utilities, it's hard to go past Mantra of Pain - Might on demand when you charge it, instant AoE pulses, and no cooldown if you use all the stacks - takes a while to prepare again though. I've mentioned Feedback - back when I levelled Mesmer, Reflects were a significant part of your overall damage output, and a defensive "get out of jail card". Null Field is overlooked these days but can be really helpful if you're worried about condition damage, or your enemy has boons (rare in PvE) - it's there if you need it. Blink is a basic bitch point-and-click teleport, Portal is a more permanent, higher range wormhole - mostly for Jumping Puzzles, or in my case, being kinda bad at Jumping Puzzles. Signet of Inspiration is, for your purposes, a nice movement speed buff to slot in-transit, Signet of illusions is free clones and a reset on your shatters (which you should be making use of all the time). Mimic lets you use any of the above twice in a row (apart from Mantra of Pain which doesn't need it.)
---
Mesmer is a different levelling experience to other classes - there's no one "right build". Other classes can pretty much autoattack something until it dies, heal up, and repeat. You can't - you have a lot of powerful tools with very specific purposes, and the key is knowing when you need them. Reflects are useless if you're being stabbed but can utterly trivialise dealing with ranged mobs. You have a stupid amount of evasion with Sword 2 and your Distortion shatter, but you have to time it well. Likewise with interrupting attacks - you have stuns, dazes, pushes and pulls. 
---
The only way to figure this out is with experience. Use your clone and phantasm skills on cooldown, and if you have 3, use a shatter - Mind Wrack for damage, Distortion for "oh no I'm gonna die". Watch for telegraphed attacks and evade them, or interrupt them before they hit you. Experiment - if something is giving you trouble, then try something else. Run away if you need to - clones are nice cannon fodder to let you regroup. If you're still learning, Mesmer can be tough, but if your tactics are right you can handle pretty much anything.
---
Awesome man! Always great to hear new people joining this gem of a game! If you've got any questions feel free to ask them! 
---
I imagine Gankdara aren't too happy :)
---
Nope, a game dev adds in what they're told. Whether it's what people want or what's good for the game is up for debate.
---
Honestly what's the point of not posting it? It's being posted in the many discords i'm on anyway.
---
Like we predicted, it breaks wvw again.
---
GGWP
---
Hello. I was wondering what is the fastest way to obtain legendary armor? PvP? PvE? WvW? Do you have a guide that you can share to follow the steps for getting those legendaries gears? Thanks in advanced üòÅ
---
you can always start with the f2p core game.
---
welcome to Tyria!
---
* Limit by 1 per team.
---
* Walking arrow cart, control by 5 (guild) players.
---
* Vulnerable for warclaw and ballista.
---
* Slow movement speed but players can boost up.
---
you can start with the core game for now
---
Base game is free to play and expansions have no impact on the early game. You have some restrictions but you can start playing right now. https://account.arena.net/welcome
---
And get hold of a friend/guildmate/random guy with all the home instance nodes, if you don't have them yourself.
---
Steady and easy source of daily progression towards the stack(s) of material
---
That basically means that the group is not performing well for some reason. With HoT and PoF powercreep the no updraft is a new norm for example.
---
Afterwards.
---
Exactly. Before it was a joke of invisibility: you could not be seen or targeted directly, but you could be bombed with AoEs despite being "invisible". Compare that with all other classes that can use invisibility.
---
You are wrong. You have to be dedicated to wvw, many of us never even went to play anything else. Now look, a bunch of newbies coming into wvw just for the mount, they don't care about builds, they don't care about discord or following tag. They just a farm of headless chickens thinking that SM is the keep. Do you really think anyone will want to come to play wvw after being literally farmed every minute? They even stopped giving me wxp with x3 boost. Their commander just left because good players couldn't get in. I doubt you will return to the same avenue after being gang banged there. Do we need players who don't care nor about builds, nor about voip? NO!
---
If these were untradeable maybe you‚Äôd have a point. But BLTC skins are usually 50-70g on the TP post release which isn‚Äôt unreasonable compared to the mats it takes to craft some achievement or story based items.
---
Can you buy the catmander tags there too? Or just the minis?
---
when will you stop?
---
You need help lol
---
I don't really know when. Regarding what we gonna learn it could be just more details on the character's backstory and its feelings regarding this defeat....
---
Aurene... My cute little one..
---
Why didn't they call this achievement "Purrfect Fit"?  Feels like a missed opportunity.
---
No. They did it for the cash money
---
Let 3 rangers use Call of the Wild at the same time.
---
Did he say wins automatically? No. He said advantage.
---
It's probably intended but since you have to choose between Corrosive Plating and Dispersion field, Medic Gyro can be either powerful heals are pulsing condi cleanse. Definitely a smart design from the devs. 
---
Sshhh they dont need to know this one ;3.
---
I had to respec to put a point into the warclaw, and forgot gliding. Followed the comm off a cliff and found myself mashing the keyboard while wondering why I was not gliding.

The WvW team only has 1 full time dev on it. I'm not sure if there's a full time QA person or not.

And few colours that mean preety much nothing.  
---
Don't get me wrong I love GW2 much more than I like Apex, but c'mon. Only similarity between those systems is fact that those are "pings' nothing more. There is nothing to praise in GW2's system.  
---
&gt;fast as (or faster) than a person on foot with swiftness in any territory
---
Faster. The warclaw has a peak sustained speed of around 600 u/s. A player OOC with swiftness is 392 u/s.
---
That's SUSTAINED speed, btw. As in using only one bar of endurance for the dash every time it fills up, which still gives you two extra bars in reserve. If you decide to burn all three bars at once, the warclaw can burst to much higher speed.
---
I guess  it depends on 2 things
---
1. One are they already written and just awaiting release to spread it out.
---
2. Not yet written, which then produces the question if the writer is still there or if they have the capacity to continue it.
---
Let's hope it was all prewritten üòÅ
---
Well before, you could trick enemies into thinking you were still with the Stealth gyro since it lags behind this diverting their attention.
---
The new gyro is pretty OP since you can't even see the stealth gyro
---
[Seriously though.](https://youtu.be/9Deg7VrpHbM)
---
Shh....Let him dream! 
---
If you want the easiest kills go magi scourge.
---
Question is, are these even exploits? It's not like it's hard to find, it's not like you do something that's illegal in the game, you're litterally just jumping with some bad game design they introduced. 
---
I totally agree. Especially if "idle without coming back" is all they intend to do. For a short break, to avoid requeueing at the moment, that's understandable.
---
Because it's definitely worse now
---
I meant the overall zones in WoW have no loading screens (aside the minimal few that do*)
---
I know, but OPness isn't the only reason skills change. 
---
Okay who is this guy? I see the picture everywhere for other memes. Looks funny and I want to see more üòÖ
---
Scrapper is currently broken in PvP.
---
Wait, so you can go back to PvE and still get that residual participation? What about logging out? 
---
That's the reason I've been idling at the waypoint after playing for a while.
---
I know there were security issues related to this thing, but has technology come far enough so we can have this sexy back?  
---
I mean Gorseval was always designed that way. The world eater skill can be handled in thwo ways: increase dps, go out of the arena. No design flaws there imo. The boss is almost 4 years old. It should be piece of cake with new elite specs etc. The thing is Anet hasn't given us much challenge after that. Gorseval was hard. As was VG and Sabetha. It's just that average raider is much more capable now and skill needed in new raids should mirror that, but they don't.
---
I mean the design of outer and inner walls/gates is quite clearly so you have to break through both of them, giving defenders time to rally and drive you off. so anything that can circumvent that and give the attackers an unfair advantage (i.e. halfing the time it takes to capture) can quite comfortably called an exploit.
---
and in the past it never mattered if an exploit was easy to abuse or not, if I remember correctly the very first banwave in 2012 was over an item that vendors sold for cheaper than intended. they made it quite clear back then that if anything seems to good to be true and you don't steer clear, you're willfully exploiting no matter what you say. I disagree with that stance quite strongly but that's how it is and it's not worth getting bothered about.
---
it seems that the upgraded armor set is only skins
---
I don't quite follow how Burst of Strength fits in, but overall it does indeed look like maintaining high vuln wouldn't be too difficult, particularly if you build specifically for it.
---
I've been meaning to get into fractals - that's why I'm working on Viper's.
---
It's a complicated answer. 
---
Druid+Chrono as a pair are still aged older than the other support combinations however they are by far not the only optimal options. Some fights in raids are better off with double chrono+druid while others are better off with double quickbrand renegade + soulbeast(s) for the spirits. 
---
However, due to the added restriction, pugs don't like that (which I might remind everyone that historically, we used to have mirror comps where only four dps slots were flexible and open compared to now which has six dps slots being flexible).
---
Firebrand Renegade comps offer more damage than chrono druid can which does make up for the buffs loss but your comparison between DPS will be skewed as a result because even though your group DPS might be higher, you have people who are narrow minded and look only at their number then claim a comp is inferior. 
---
And even within firebrand renegade comps, there's the distinction between condi quickbrand heal renegade or heal firebrand diviner's renegade. The latter being more used for 5 man
---
It persists. You can log out and next time you enter WvW you'll start at max participation. 
---
yep it gives only skins.

---
Try just adding another point when you get in wvw. Also, I think the bugs have been patched, so, yay!
---
&gt; Can't really see it as a glitch either. 
---
They have patched so no other class skill can do this.
---
&gt;  I'd say its an inconvenience rly, maybe unintended, but I can't make out how it will influence the gameplay if it remains. 
---
Have you played wvw? They are skipping from the outerwall of a keep into the innerwall which is where you are usualy setting up your defence. As you saw in op's vid he was able to jump in and attack siege/people there while bypassing the gate or walls completaly.
---
Now imagine when 20 people do it. And there is no point in trying to defend keeps anymore as you can just jump over the walls instead.
---
The separate skins are part of the collection and achievements, so when you have collected all 6 Requiem pieces you will have both finished the collection and have acquired an entire set of Requiem armor. They are just skins though, not actual armor.
---
Yes.  It only decays when you're in WvW.  You can go logout or do some PvE, next time you go to a WvW map you'll be at the same participation level.
---
I mean these types of groups generally shouldn‚Äôt need a healer anyway? If your group doesn‚Äôt need healing it‚Äôs much better to simply replace the healer with a dps than to sit there and do practically nothing.

I was thinking about keep capture too.  However, since yesterday that has been a breeze.  Captured like 8 keeps in a session since everything is paper, that is usually about how many I capture in a week (I mostly roam).
---
Oh, I get that part, I'm just not quite sure how one would apply vuln with Burst of Strength, beyond perhaps proccing Expose Defenses at the start of a fight. It could be that there's some interaction in PvP/WvW that I'm not aware of, but all I can find on the wiki is some minor changes to the cooldown and/or damage.
---
Hmm I‚Äôm inclined to disagree, Wing 1 in general is a good introductory wing to raids. VG is especially a noob stomper due to actually having to dodge, manage red orbs, and if you don‚Äôt have a competent healer, you also need to do greens. Gorse and Sab are perhaps more lenient, but still pretty tough for new raiders.
---
Right now, revisiting Wing 1 with updated mechanics and in light of the PoF powercreep would only make the wing less accessible to new players

10% of 20 is 2; 35% of 100 is 35.

Were you able to test? I wasn't able to go into WvW last night.
---
Yep. We need to kill him and make it ours!
---
There are also the tears of your team's tryhards, but those tend to be too salty.
---
I thought people were being hyperbolic when they said the WvW crowd hates any change to WvW, despite constant bitching about wanting changes, and will rage/cry about literally anything.
---
Guess I was wrong.

Try reducing character models to lowest and enabling effect LOD. It may not solve ping issue, but it should be more playable. I have fairly bad internet, but my ping isn't constantly that bad.

The weapons are basically two separate recipies. You don't really upgrade anything.

You end up with the exotic version and the ascended version of the weapons.

Costs about the same as normal ascended crafting when you make them the first time.

Lol buddy keep your complex to yourself.

I prefer PoF‚Äôs one mostly because it‚Äôs darker in color. Both the vanilla  and HoT blinded me with their brightness lol
---
Well it took 5 years to fix Garrison Gate to upgrade with the rest of the keep so i have no big hopes for them being fast about this.
---
I just don't understand the reason to pay for dedicated QA testing by 20 some people who applied for a job when you have thousands of players willing to sign up for beta testing and here's the thing.. players would do it for small in game rewards and fun.. so many other games do it I don't get why anet doesn't do it when they have a community that actually cares about the game and would have fun doing it, be better at it, and cost less. A program like this would also draw lots of drama which is what people want. "Omg did you hear the rumor we are getting this" bla bleh etc.. publicity would be better and they wouldn't have to engage as much in communicating with the community as people would do it... for free.

It's just bad business and shows the pure lack of effort. Have users rate your product before launch is the smartest business idea, you get real world users, passionate, cheap, and most importantly, users want to do good because the appreciation for the company. The rewards for the players are huge in terms of quality. The rewards for the company are huge because of the money saved + a reliable source of information which also saves money. 
---
Blood 113, Death 1X3, Scourge 131 would be what they're using if they're running Harbinger Shroud
---
Many thanks! 
---
Can't engage the war score out of you
---
I‚Äôll definitely be buying any wvw related cash shop items just to encourage the development time
---
Exact same game. Both are garbage brs
---
they actually released 7 mount skins earnable in game. the raptor, the springer, the jackal, the hovercraft (lets be honest no one really uses this), griffon, rollerbeetle and now the warkitty
---
I wouldn't say "didn't want it". I was just realistic about it _immediately_ making "jump into where you kinda shouldn't be able to" way easier. And then months and months (if not years) to fix these new exploits, if at all. "Fix" in a really weird way too. Like, "Fine, if we have to involve our landscape-building intern, we'll make a giant moat with crocodiles around inner in Garry, shift the whole structure by 2000 units south and make extra destructible wall :P
---
But unless you _really_ deal with it all the time, new addition is fun for casual WvW players.
---
I guess I don‚Äôt play enough WvW to understand the syntax. I know what a war score is, I guess it just hits the ear wrong with me then.
---
Did you just... Did you just ask about Garden Warfare 2?
---
Same and spending the BL tickets on the glass weapons as well
---
Except that they already don't do this with a lot of things. A lot of recipes, for instance, are named "reaver" or "bastion" or "spire"  or "needler", etc.
---
Yeah sure, you can make a decent guess as to what those are, maybe, and after a while you learn, but it's mildly annoying for vets and probably extremely confusing to newbies.
---
Massive spiky ball of death reaching speeds of 90kph!  
---
That jump in Garrison would be the first thing i would try out. It is so obvious just by looking at it. 
---
We even said so before a mount was announced to WvW that adding mounts will have people jumping in to keeps and towers and it will take ages for them to solve it. 
---
You would imagine that they would at least have ONE dev moving around each keep and tower to see the obviouse possible bugs. That would maybe take one hour if that. So don't try to make it sound like a big deal.
---
Exactly, that's the issue with Renegade. Imo, the heal ren comp offers more damage, but lacks in healing. You miss that panic button other classes have, so in pugs who are not attacking so quickly to trigger the life steal and taking so much unnecessary damage it becomes a problem. Honestly, if you're playing at a level where the ren healing suffices, i'd suggest dropping the healing gear entirely in favor of quicker phases and less incoming damage.  
---
I still think that in raids, as a second healer it does good enough, but for pugging fractals FB is too much of a QoL to waste...
---
If you WvW you don't have enough gold to spend on stuff like that.
---
If you have video, double check your life force threshold as you need 25% in Scourge for the trait to proc.
---
Been looking at this for the last couple hours (on and off) and i can honestly say, I'm liking the sound of it haha!
---
Will have to set it out and try it tonight!
---
The pages are just lying around EBG as usable yellow-text items, some times just in the middle of everything (ie I found one north of ANZ, west of the lake before the camp).
---
I've had no problems finding them, other than the 2nd page Rules of the Mists which I can't seem to locate..
---
The game is certainly NOT dying. What's worrying however, is the fact that they will just start working on a possible expansion. That means the game will only have periodical Living World releases every 3-4 months for the next let's say 1,5-2 years. I think that the after-PoF period showed that although it is a viable option, it won't be placing the game on an upward spiral. I, personally, won't be excited for another LS-release even if the quality¬†story keeps on improving. The current state of the game (the lay-offs) just reinforced the fact that the scheme of the releases will remain the same for a longer period of time. Some will argue that this is not a bad thing, I would say we badly needed an expansion this autumn which obviously won't happen. 
---
But then again, the game is up and running, new patches are being released but¬†I'm convinced the game is currently on a downward spiral.
---
Tested it with golem with 100%LF that's where I confirmed it was not proccing with standard desert shroud
---
true, but i just noticed how great it actually Looks in-game later
---
Never try meme again.
---
Some WvW'ers do strictly that. Some do some PvE during the week for gold and build changes etc - regarldess, 150gems is much easier to get than 1000 :) the pass is there for those who want it, those who don't well thats that then
---
This is pretty much me too. I was not expecting huge exploits like this.
---
XD you're welcome, and the sad thing is, that was actually pretty brief. All the specialisations have their merits, and you'll get them all by level 80, but I think Inspiration probably has the highest impact early on - built in reflects are a game changer. I don't run Dueling much anymore but did when I levelled up: seeing as clones are essentially a resource to make your shatters better, free ones for dodging is always nice, and it means the thing you're dodging can hit the clone for a bit instead. When you are a bit more comfortable with your class you can take more offensive options, but it's a lot easier to learn your class if you're alive, and these specs give you a very tangible way to do so. 
---
Focus definitely shines against ranged enemies (even without Warden's Feedback the focus phantasm destroys projectiles, use him/her for cover) and it isn't your most damaging off-hand, but it has so many niche utilities that I usually run it against melee mobs anyway.
---
You'll unlock the whole core Mesmer package at level 80, these are just the sort of, bread and butter things that you can grab early and get some instant value out of. This is a Power damage build because Condition builds only really shine at Level 80 - you won't be finding any gear that increases your condition duration before then and don't have access to the Mirage specialisation, so condi feels kinda lacklustre. Power, Precision and Ferocity are your main damage attributes to look for on your gear - Power is always worth it, but core Mesmers should actually prioritise Precision (critical hit chance), as Reflect damage is calculated with the opponent's Power. Mesmer doesn't have the highest personal DPS in the world, but you don't need it if you can just make mobs shoot themselves instead!
---
As you are getting Feedback from Glamours anyway, I'd complete that tree ASAP for Time Warp. You and your allies attack quicker, the bad guys attack slower - it's always useful.
---
Aaaaand I'll stop vomiting Mesmer tidbits now. XD Hope some of it helps.
---
Those aren't weapon skins. I'm talking about specifically the skins from black lion tickets. Every single one follows the traditional names for easy searching on the TP.
---
You can get to lvl 80 as a free account too, only masteries are locked behind the expansions
---
Just like my RPs in Salma District.
---
Bulwark is very good in a zerg setting still, but you have to watch the timing of it. If you pop it right before the enemy bombs you, yeah-you're gonna die. It's good to help with your sustain, just after you really jump into the fray. It's still absolutely worth running, in my opinion. Even if you hate the gyro itself, the toolbelt is still one of the best skills in wvw.
---
I don't think that OP is talking about balance patches. The big updates were nowhere near on schedule especially given the previously mentioned number of staff (400).¬†They were inconsinsent and even delayed.   
---
Even the balance patches had problems. It is common knowledge that the balance of certain game modes is just horrible. ArenaNet thinks that by slowly tweaking the numbers will slow long-hanging problems in the game.
---
Scrapper finally viable? I've been an engi main since launch and I thought this day would never come.
---
A funny glitch. Porting back to spawn didnt undo it until I switched maps.
---
The stuff they do give you has no value. If you play WvW, youre broke. The little money you make goes straight into food.
---
From my experience, when pugging, people tend to prefer looking for a druid right off the bat instead of going for a comp without a healer, since you have no idea how good your group will be. Then, if the group happens to be good, you'll run into CA issues as a druid.
---
r/guildwarsgonewild
---
You can not cc them so they will jump in all of them without people being able to stop them. And the jump is not difficult you move forward, press jump skill, done.
---
Nope, they do not see the Smoke field that you produce thanks to this gyro either. Because Gyro became Wells you can only see the gyro floating around the Scrapper (except if the Scrapper is stealthed) but you have no other way to know which is active since you can't select them.
---
So, all invisibility of all classes is OP?
---
Forgot the last one, heal from the Elite spirit seem to not care at all about the healing power of the ranger/druid it's linked to or any modifier. From the Druid PoV it looks like the heal comes from them ("You heal X for 150 using...") but from the reciever PoV (I was on Warrior if that matters) you see that the spirit itself was healing me ("Spirit of Nature's Renewal heals you for 150 using Natures'Renewal Aura"). So it means that this healing was not taking into account the healing power of the Druid, nor any modifier and was not activating traits like Nature's Mender. So you only get the base healing which is like a slightly stronger base regen :p
---
This seems great, thank you!
---
No quickness? fucking awful gyro 8(

They should use the same panel as teleport to friend for this:
---
1. Add a new list of teleport devices. It could be opened with one more of the following: 
---
 * A new button in the toolbar at the top.
---
 * A new button in the minimap. 
---
 * A new button in the panel that appears when clicking a waypoint. 
---
 * An item you can get for free from a BL representative if you have any teleport device unlocked or in your inventory. 
---
2. Using it would show a panel like the one that appears with [Teleport to friend](https://i.imgur.com/xMlzNKV.jpg). But instead character portraits you'll see the icons of the teleport devices, and instead the character names the device names, and the destinations below the names like in the teleport to friend. Temporary passes would not be added. 
---
3. To add a teleporter device to the list, you open the list while you have the item in your inventory, and it'll appear at the top to add. Double click it to add.
---
4. Each destination would have a little checkbox in the corner. You would be able to select 5 destinations as favorites, and those would appear at the top. 
---
5. Gemstore teleporters would appear at the bottom of the list while they are available in the current gemstore rotation.
---
No problem!

Are they maybe doing more crafting than you? Crafting also earns XP, and there have been characters that I've pushed through a few levels just using crafting, so it's not an insignificant source of XP.
---
This annoys me too. You're in WvW to play the game mode. How devoid of common decency do you have to be to AFK at spawn when you know there is a queue of dozens of players whose spot you're taking?

---
The first SoI nerf hurt but I'm used to it now - hell, the latest patch kinda looks like a net buff if you squint at it hard enough. 
---
I mean, I personally wish we lived in a world where the optimal Raid comp was three Mirage, 3 Berserker Chrono, 2 Harriers Chrono healers, 1 Diviners boonbitch and a Minstrels Chronotank but I get that people want to play their suboptimal classes for some reason
---
Good thing i can just not give a shit and afk wherever i like :]
---
The toxicity will die down. A lot of the trolls are out in full force.
---
But, this isn't a nice game mode. It's not all hunky dory everyone gets to participate. It has a map cap, winning fights matters for capturing objectives, and what you do does matter so if you do it wrong and everyone dies some people will start blaming others.
---
GW2 has coddled it's players for the most part, especially in PvE. WvW is not PvE, so don't expect anything to be the same.
---
Also, the trolling isn't that bad. Just ignore it or block it. I'd bet you 100 gold that you could talk to any long-time WvWer and their block list is quite large.
---
Garrison water gate - just jump over
---
There is an AFK check of around 10 minutes active in WvW as well.
---
that's some companies have public test servers. Imo anet doesn't even have testers and probably only people who implement new stuff test it on their own
---
Where's the charr with boobs???

That's in WvW.

I just exclaimed "holy shit!" so loudly my fiance woke up from a deep sleep.

It's a checkbox right below the pulldown menu
---
Well they have gliding disabled for enemy territory. Why not do the same with the warclaw?
---
No, Jesus needs us
---
Not really. The game needs to fit assets as well as give a basic idea of threats. Sometimes a creature is too big in lore to fit what the game can reasonably handle.
---
Conquest mount, the mount really nobody needs. Or better Stronghold mount to strengthen the focus on this gamemode.
---
Broken as in too good or are its skills not working properly?
---
In my experience if all you want is the 2g the best way is to just win a rated PVP game. I know a lot of people don't enjoy PVP but you can get your rating low enough to almost always win. In the off-season just win a casual PVP game and then gather or do the daily recommended fractal.
---
With [arc dps](https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/)  you will be able to evaluate your dps while playing. It has been okayed by annet so you will be perfectly safe using it. :)

Oh is there? My bad then. With the way people were talking about it I assumed there wasn‚Äôt one.

Engi just doesn't have the luxury to take such situational skills into their valuable utility slots. war whoud like a word with you,you know,that class WITHOUT extra 5 skills and utility which give you ANOTHER  5 skills.

If maps are still full, go into eotm. You can actually do 90% of the warclaw stuff in eotm except for purchasing the items from the vendor and capturing a camp for the collection (no camps in eotm)

Just to point this out as someone who has used reshape A Ton. If you ever think, ‚Äòoh, I‚Äôm not sure I like Reshade‚Äô, than that is not a thing. If you don‚Äôt like the way it looks, it‚Äôs because your don‚Äôt like the current Reshade ‚Äòsettings‚Äô. There are enough settings in this thing to take the game from photo realism to borderlands. And specific to this, yes you can adjust the smearing aka depth of field blur. Yes if you want to have it look the way you want it you can get there by utilizing the settings or downloading presets for it. :D Have fun!

Omg I didn't expect to remember this from waaaaay back in the launch days but it feels comfy and familiar

Did they reuse this track for parts of the personal story?

There is so much /r/woooosh here. GG

i'm up for that. new raid location?

And what I remember is guilds that were formed to break EOTM maps which had 3 different sides cooperating and capturing objectives one after another between each other. They were also harassing anyone who tried to defend or play the objectives instead of getting into the karma cycle.
---
It is a PvP map that has player killing enabled, forming groups and killing others is part of the map.

Side note, the 100 UM cost of a bloodstone capacitor is *substantially* cheaper than the item that resets Mist trinkets - in any of the currencies it's available in.  If you think you might change gear stats on a character (if it's a Mesmer or if you're on Marauder and know you'll be Berserker eventually, for example) then Bloodstone trinkets are worth the grind.
---
It helps that you can get flax and plenty of opportunities to roll for pearls while farming the map.
---
You got out meme'd so hard you deleted your post. ggwp
---
I don't know, I'll gladly go for the last updraft if something messes up in the fight. (DPS slows down, people get egged, CC too fast, etc.)
---
Taking the updraft to secure the kill is much more palatable to me than starting the entire encounter over again.
---
Entirely depends on game mode and class. For open world stuff, do whatever you want. If you want to see meta builds use metabattle (for all around although not always the best best), snowcrows for raids or discretize.eu for raids. If nothing else it will give you a gist of the best weapons for each class. 
---

Underwater as a last mount, we don't really need any more.
---
Oh I don't mind waiting for WvW, I was just looking it over and did the point and was concerned when nothing unlocked.  I'll do more of it today, maybe.
---
It feels weird to have this buffed and Istan nerfed again at the same time - though I guess both adjustments are consistent with the stated goal of not wanting players to live on a single map.
---
Don't boost an Engie or Ele, level them up and get used to the abilities. Welcome to the game and glad to have you!
---
Anyway to link a build?? Trying to find a good support build for wvw and having some trouble. 
---
The biggest QoL improvement of the patch.
---
I took me 20 minutes, once I could get into a map.
---
SH is not necessarily hard, the RNG elements of it make it harder than it has to be. Largos twins are not the most difficult fight (Portal strat simplifies this boss by a significant amount). 
---
Innovation and new content is what is needed for GW2 to not die.  Band-aiding PvP and WvW aren't going to cut it.  There's a reason why they've been ignoring it.  It isn't as popular as PvE and they can't easily monetize it.
---
Welcome to all MMO-Gamers Valhalla!
---
I would still prefer to use Slick Shoes in that case, as the toolbelt gives a good amount of super speed with low cooldown, and even works as a stun break. And Slick Shoes are situationally quite useful, when your zerg is in the middle of a charge, for example. Sure, Purge Gyro can give super speed too...but only after the skill itself expires. And if i'm getting it for the cleanses, surely i'm not wasting its use for the aftereffect. Especially since super speed cannot stack, anyway (so even if i used multiple gyros together, i would still end up with 5s or so of superspeed).
---
That said, i agree that the toolbelt of purge gyro should be reworked. Putting a long pulsing poison field along with a condition cleanse may be nice thematically...but it isn't too useful for supporting. 
---
It's been a while since the last time i used fraps so i didn't even know it was recording my mic.
---
You were deeply wrong. I play every content this game offers. And raid community, which is almost as small as WvW is nowhere near as toxic and alienating as WvW community. You guys, well some of you, love to throw a tantrum like a child in a supermarket that didn't get what they wanted. If I was at Anet I would fcking given up long time ago. You bring compared to PvE almost no revenue for the studio, yet somehow you are the loudest one in bitching.
---
This is why I read comments.
---
the meta is changing at an alarming rate  ( Õ°‡∫à‚ï≠Õú ñ‚ïÆÕ°‡∫à ) 
---
Literally everything the game tells us about Mordremoth is assumed to be non canon, at least by this sub
---
No... They were a good idea. I just thought theyd have more thought. 
---
A means to counter their presence would be good like placing mines or turrets.
---
And definitely lowering the damage they do on engage.
---
Its also sad that a few classes who were really good at scouting and roaming are now competing with everything else.
---
"WvW players are so bad that they can't do raids, because successfully doing one takes more skill that pressing 1 on a door."
---
"WvW players are so bad that they can't do sPvP, because successfully winning a match takes significantly more skill than zerging."
---
"WvW players can only zerg each other, and fool themselves into thinking they're actually good when they kill a single player as a zerg."
---
See how easy it is?
---
Nothing new there. Whether people afk on their mounts or not, there were loads of people afk‚Äôing in the lobby prior.
---
Mostly due to the fact they get their pip counter up, and then just stay the bare minimum active to keep the pips flowing (i know cuz i‚Äôm guilty as charged, but i try to limit that behavior to downtimes)
---
So i did the node farming with one character, yielding a total of 21 rubies (2 from fast dailies). Got my second character there, but could just harvest one more node and after that the rest disappeared. checked with a third character but no more ruby spots left. Seems to be the cap is still active.
---
Post saved ! I'll check it after work
---
For PVP, I really don't see this as an issue. The PVP meta is mostly power damage so all the condi cleanses aren't as valuable. Instant resses are pretty disgusting yes, but since most players tend to just cleave bodies and that you can just see downed bodies on the mini map, Stealth G is mostly used to prevent stomps or provide peels for allies. 
---
Scrapper is indeed a powerful PVP support but I don't think it's at the level of firebrand.
---
If you need a timegate to make people playing stuff, then something with your map design is probably not very good
---
I hope a underwater mount.

Nightmare fuel
---
Coincidentally this is how my cat treats my bed if I leave the door open.
---
Honestly, the WvW community has an opportunity here that I don't think they realize:  
---
Here's this event or situation where lots of new people are coming into these maps, maybe even just for a short time and then, right then, is the point where you can roll up and put on a show and sell WvW to them as being fun and entertaining.  
---
However.  
---
I'm not the only person in this thread that's going to talk about the less than savory and less than polite responses PvE players are getting coming in. This, I respectfully submit, is *not* the first impression you want to make upon people.   
---
If you act exclusionary, then people are going to presume based on that you don't want them there and they will indeed leave....and not come back.   
---
I'm kind of surprised the more veteran players and guilds haven't sat down, organised between themselves a 'demo day' of some kind with several commanders on whatever side leading and you get out there, show them the basics and close off any of the negative chatter. Honestly, that's one of the things that turns casuals or people checking it out off the most.   
---
I've been told on other times on other games that trash talking is part of pvp and WvW type scenarios. What I've seen that called in other games, particularly where voice chat is concerned is *harassment*. And like it or not, it conjures up precisely the worst things you've heard of or imagined; racist, sexist, derogatory comments that don't really have a place in any game, anywhere, anytime.  
---
This isn't me coming in as some sort of moral guardian or 'game police', I think it's probably how the vast majority of people who play games would prefer *not* to be treated.   
---
I'm not saying either there aren't issues in meta events in the PvE realm say if people are doing the Silverwastes and such, but I more often than not hear glowing reviews about the Commanders who treat everyone who's come along, veteran or not, equally as if it's their first time because it creates a sense of community and inclusivity and people keep going back to follow them for HP trains or earning mounts, whatever.   
---
I'd *love* to see GW2's WvW community get a strong positive reputation which might in turn get it some love from ANet *because* it's become well known and well liked.   
---
But that's just me as a filthy casual and PvE'er.....
---
Well yeah, granted. I wouldn't either. But I highly doubt the 20 odd people I see parking their characters at spawn have been taking a leak for the last 10 minutes.
---
Good job!
---
because you're forced to do those shitty hearts, i've done that collection on map release and i still feel seething hatred towards that inquest related heart. 
---
Same thing happened to me in the past. Before 2016 update I hated WvW with all my might, and single thought of going there for a reward track for my gift was making me want to quit the game. But then I saw Warbringer, the only Legendary backpack that really visually hooked me up. It took me almost a year to get it playing on and off wvw. But I put the effort to learn the meta, builds and what is played how. I felt in love with Rev again thanks to that. After I got Warbringer I took a break. But I felt this empty spot whenever I would log in back in to the game. And soon I came back and stayed. Playing just for fun, enjoying actual game mode.   
---
Problem is not you being a PvE player, I'm a Pve mostly orientated player. The problem is not wanting to adjust to the game mode you are playing. Same with raids, or fractals. You just have to put in the effort. And trust me after that your effort will be rewarded with advance ;)   
---
Ps. Don't worry about soy chat in WvW. WvWers are like warewolfs, they change their form whenever there is a balance patch that brings something new to the mode. After a week the curse is lifted, and everything backs to normal state. There's a lot of laughter, fun and helpful people in the chat. 
---
Stop repost for karma farming it‚Äôs annoying as fuck 
---
+ Gw2 and apex cannot be compare 
---
Welcome to WvW!  I hope you stick around.
---
Yeah, (we) WvW regulars frequently gripe about *numbers* and player population, so the influx of new players is greatly appreciated and hella fun (though, admittedly, I did feel bad beating up on so many unsuspecting PVE-only players).  There was like **zero downtime** last night for the 4 hours I played.  I stacked a ton of boosts, gained a bunch of rank levels, and had a blast!
---
The people complaining about new/PVE players aren't even young enough to see an R-rated movie alone, and get an advance on weekend chore money from mom in order to get gemstore items.  Fuck 'em.  I don't even hear them when they whine, so don't even listen to it.  The world needs a separate Tween Internet, badly.
---
It‚Äôs annoying to to 16 times the same thing in 16 different days 
---
I guess you'd be right if it wasn't for this being possible since the base game, lol. Guardian GS3,  Warrior Sword2 cancel, etc were all abusable where this mount is. At this point I feel like if a leap skill is being made, the WvW team should probably, you know, check it out in those same spots.
---
Beware that the massive pvp might be less massive when people get their wvwvw mount :( 
---
Please make more. I love penetrative stuff like this &lt;3
---
TECHNOLOGY IS HERE!
---
Sorry! I had to go through my old screenshots because when I came back my legendaries were missing, and ANet customer support claims they cannot prove I ever had or lost my legendaries when I have Twilight and The Bifrost unlocked as skins and I have 2/3 achievement progress. So naturally the first screenshot I encountered was this one and it was pretty powerful to me and I thought I would share.
---
They are all big. Mordremoth is said to be the Jungle of Magumma, Primordus burrows down below, It is believed the dragon in Drakkar Lake in GW1 was Jormag. I like the idea of the underwater dragon being the water itself like Mordremoth is the jungle and can control it to his whims maybe the underwater dragon can control the seas and cause destruction. Kralkatorrik is interesting because I think we have see it the most. At the end of PoF, People say in the first instance of episode 4 you can see Kralkatorrik when Aurene goes into the rift, we saw Kralkatorrik at the end of the episode 5 trailer and in the battle in All or Nothing and of course in the final instance of A star to Guide us. I'd say Kralkatorrik is as big as the Crystal Desert itself because of the amount of brand it creates. Zhaitan is a baby and people should treat him as such.
---
Got keep in eotm, took 5 mins
---
Smarter than you, yes. I've seen your posts enough to know this fact.
---
they blocked the hidden cave in dredge tunnels
---

---
Yup yup. The weapon skills and the specialisation skills are separate. 
---
I only really use my shield on my chronomancer for group stuff or if I know I'll want more blocks. I can still use wells and continuum shift whenever. 
---
Do not use words that you don't understand how to use.
---
WTF !!!!! I never knew that you can do that and I'm 3 char lvl 80 
---
That tells you how well this is explained .... 
---
How do you do that ? (The light pillars)
---
I admit I forgot this as well. It should say it on the mouse-over for the rewards. 
---
That word does not mean what you think it means.
---
Depending on the server you were on they had the potential to be pretty bad.  I remember waiting a LOT at launch but my server was one of the top 3 for the first 6-8 months or so before they took away free server transfers.
---
I also have a screenshot of my level 11 ranger capping stonemist for the first time, so...  lol
---
Damn, it's *crazy* to see that in motion *again* after all these years. Thank you for sharing this! :)
---
Sometimes I log onto GW just to hear the music again in special areas that brought me joy and sorrow.
---
Doesn't help you if you still missed the joke.
---
&gt;The time-gating
---
That's why.  It's very un-GW2-ish.  Like suddenly I'm playing a mid-00's MMO or something.
---
&gt;I probably won't return to Draconis Mons much following that
---
Yeah you will.  The flax farm is really nice.
---
I mentioned how one could argue that parts of the rifle could represent Balth, but that I overall still don't see these as "Balth weapons", and to me that's the end of it.
---
Pictures won't change a thing, I know what Balthazar looks like. 
---
You're right, it is. But if it means stopping exploitation, then be it - at least temporary until ArenaNet can change map- and or objective layout. For some reason, changes of geometry other than invisible walls seem to be an incredible workload to process, i cannot explain it otherwise. There's a hole in Divinity's Reach which can be accessed to get under the map. Guess what ArenaNet did to prevent that: They placed more and more invisible walls around it instead of actually fixing the hole.
---
Honestly, the fact they gave the mount a leap is a HUGE mistake. And I'm someone saying that in favor of the mount.
---
You need a commander tag which costs 300g.
---
This was one of the worst changes in the history of GW2 alongside the change to winds of disenchantment. They turned conceptually perfectly fine skills into skilleffects that eliminate counterplay. Gyros did need some kind of buff but a complete functionality change in such a manner is toxic to any form of counterplay and was a grave mistake balance wise.
---
Hello can someone expain me how I get this aura is a bug or something? It happens sometime in AB meta or Domain of Kourna.
---
Nope, just giving credit where credit is due. You think I care about worthless internet points? What do you think I am 12 years old? I'm going to repost this until it gets through the downvotes of real karma farmers.
---
For example, I made a thread about GW2's BR mode four days ago:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/awdxbv/guild_wars_2_battle_royale_mode/
---
But a year ago, people were unappreciative of Arenanet's bright ideas:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7pyq2u/til_gw2_had_a_survival_battle_royale_game_mode/
---
People in r/mmorpg seem to realize the genius behind this mini game:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/7pm9v7/with_the_influx_of_survival_battle_royale_games/
---
Sometimes I wonder, what is the r/guildwars2 community composed of, really?
---
people struck by the warclaw should automatically desmount. Simple. So, both starts the real fight whithout mounts
---
ppl need to chill anything happened in WvW is not game breaking as long as no extra gold is earned ok?
---
I took a stroll through your comment history and I must say the combination of love to your own made up intelligences and the lack of ability to read between lines / understanding jokes and the lack of social skills to value what a father of five with many side projects while being self employed goes through in his life is the purest form of autism I have seen in this sub. 
---
&gt; The time-gating is annoying but manageable, 16 days isn't really a whole lot. 
---
those 2 things right there. Players what the shiney's right away, and with minimal effort.
---
Anet should really pay more attention to this. They forced a wvw mount on us which most wvwers dont want at the very beginning. Now they just want to release it asap to gain attention back without proper testing. Don't force me to quit wvwing, i liked it.
---
i haven't seen WvW that packed in years. it was awesome. Just like launch. unfortunately, that meant the lag came with it but it was still a good. i'm not even bothering with the mount but it was great finding fights everywhere all the time.
---
sadly it'll all die down soon once everyone has the mount.
---
lame.....
---
Taking keeps and towers happens all the time in Edge of the Mists
---
Involved? in what sense are you involved? You're just farming the same repeatable hearts for two weeks. Easily one of the most uninspired, tedious achievements in the game. 
---
I can tell you how to take a screenshot. Want to know?
---
i actually got killed by a power scrapper last night. hasn't happened to me in a long time. i think new gyros are pretty good.
---
Something something screenshot something
---
Heaven forbid making content people actually want to play for fun.
---
Many of the weak points in WvW structures are incredibly obvious and easy to find within minutes. If you know the handful of leaps available it's pretty trivial to get into most of the towers/keeps.
---
I had the EXACT same problem at the exact same time as you had, probably server issue.
---
The patch notes indicate that Winds of Disenchantment should now have a 0.5s pulse time. The skill description has not been updated to reflect this.
---
Easy there chief. I never said they were greedy. I said that they were unwise in their decisions about testing a product before launch. And in my example they would have spent less money. 
---
"You guys".. I don't remember anyone saying that my example proves that the good people of anet are assholes like EA. 
---
All I said was that it was an unwise business strategy that costed them more money. 
---
And FYI the gold to gem converting is taking gold OUT of the game.. which is PROFITABLE for anet. I think the gold to gen conversion should stay. It's good for the company and therefore also good for me and others in the community because I personally like them and their products.. 
---
I don't understand how "if they would have done X, then the result would have been better, cheaper and faster" translates to "anet asshole company". 
---
And btw.. in the real world people don't make the 3rd biggest mmorpg for charity. Stop pretending like they're not human and don't need money to survive not only as a company but also to feed their 2 kids. 
---
Although I haven‚Äôt attempted henge myself, I too appreciate what it offers. 
---
I think what bothers most is not only the time gating, but having to do hearts. A lot of people just find hearts tedious which is very understandable. Plus this is required for aurora, which is already a long process. Then add henge and you‚Äôre doing two long collections at once which can lead to burn out. 
---
&gt; But this isnt Lion's Arch, no one really cares about how you look on the mount. 
---
And indeed, it's a much better idea to go to Lion's Arch or Divinity's Reach if you want lots of people to see it. People in WvW are most likely going to run out of spawn and not see you anyways. (or wp to keep)
---
FYI F6/PrintScr keys are default for taking in game screenshots.  They will be placed in your User/Documents/Guild Wars 2 folder.
---
Only you can prevent phone pictures of monitors!
---
Check out what's going on around skill icons when nothing is happening. Mud. 
---
&gt; I kind of plan to make a video about all these problematic spots, to give it public coverage and get them fixed fast
---
Hi, you must be new to WvW. While this strategy works for many problems in GW2 and a lot of games, it does not work for WvW. All you will do is make more people use the exploits more. WvW has a history of not having these things patched in ANY timely manner no matter how much attention you bring to it. 
---
It literally took them years to fix some of these spots that were made very public and were widely used. The "show the world so it's abused and fixed fast" strategy hurts wvw more than it helps unfortunately. Jumping into keeps and towers is STILL a problem, and they have already been abused to hell and back AND shown to anet many times.
---
Yeah pretty much lol
---
sigh, i wanna get in regular maps dammit! LOL went into that little map got ganked like crazy 
---
Battle Maul ( skill 1 of warclaw) automatically stomp the enemy who go down with skill 1 ( quote form  wiki seems to say that is a bug: "Battle Maul now finishes enemies WHO  ARE in a downed state." )  
---
Also  damage of skill seems to be affected by boon of character (like 25 stack of might etc)
---
The only advantage it has in PvE is fashion and for some people that is all that matters.
---
Thank you for this! I had trouble figuring out what boosters stack but you answered it!
---
yes
---
Does the wiki have that data? Is it user-provided?
---
i don't know of any elephant that looks like that outside of LotR. (no ears and 6 tusks)
---
Thanks so much!! I‚Äôll give it a try later tonight 
---
Only until everybody in the blob has the mount. Then we're back to the same problem.
---
I know reddit gets mad at certain stuff, so i sometimes just post shit to make the ones who often reply angry.
---
regular wvw roamers will be like...... man there are lots of zergs around
---
Multi-person, giant, slithering snake/serpent, please. Have it swim only on the surface of water, but it doesn't have skimmer's speed boost over water. 
---
Ooooh that's what you mean. If I remember correctly the entire screen boarder used to be like that.
---
Ideally, ArenaNet might be able to combine the two at least some of the time.
---
Sorry I deleted my previous post. I editted it but decided to cancel it, somehow the edit was saved (I must have misclicked). Didn't like it, I'm not proud of my "internet points".
---
Well my pc is a garbage and if I did took a picture like you said, it's even worse.. no kidding. Well is the air infront of me and the fire in my legs I mean, also when I walk there is a firey aura behind me not on the ground just behind my body.
---
...they need to be taught. No one starts knowing the ropes. Also this statement: 
---
 &gt; You have to be dedicated to wvw, many of us never even went to play anything else. 
---
is just sad. You **never** engaged with any other GW2 content? Not ever? And you really think you have to live and breathe WvW to be allowed in the mode? You're the definition of gatekeeper dude.
---
is The tournament thing what gets you into that VIP section in the heart of the mists? I haven‚Äôt got that or many of the other passes but it doesn‚Äôt bother me nearly as much because the space on the map is still discovered. It‚Äôs not like the little spot with the circus on ember bay is still fogged over, or the airship in gendarren fields, or any of them except this new one. In any case it seems people have taken my original post the wrong way so maybe I should just stay silent..
---
Every mount has its purpose. They could've just made Warclaw WvW exclusive but they didn't, which is nice.
---
BDO has better cbat, but it has literally nothing else going for it
---
Well, most wvw veterans dont like those salty cunts in teamchat either so you'll be in good company!
---
You see the same bug with the griffon too
---
A reason to always carry something valuable in your *inventory* :)
---
Welcome to 2012.
---
Not that I've been in the mode for super long, but it was kind of fun having a group of utter noobs try to get the jump on me with Rare tier Berserkers gear only and absolutely slaughter them, 2v6 style. It's like "oh, you think you're the hero here? Sorry, death comes for us all here"
---
That‚Äôs pretty high discount! 
---
Last night I was starting to make dinner after running around with the zerg. I looked over and noticed I hadn't actually left. I ran across the room to log off because I felt so bad I was holding people up.
---
I don't get how people can't realize how scummy it is.
---
I prefer this as a siege weapon. Like an iron legion tank. Make it cost a lot of resources to build.
---
So what happens if they dodge your attack? or if you dismount and then put into combat? You cant remount in combat btw.
---
Nah, gift of battle is required to make any legendary. Most PvE players have spent at least a little time in WvW
---
I think pretty much the same way. If you want the shiny putting in effort to get it is not unreasonable.
---
As far as I can tell, the most of the GW2 community doesn't distinguish between 'fun' and 'rewards' then it comes to 'repeatable content.' Or content.
---
Wait for a sale, it's usually around 25 USD then for both expansions.
---
My main issue was just redoing hearts so often-repeatable hearts are one of my least favorite features of the game.
---
Players: we need leaping/gliding/map breaking with specific skills into objectives fixed. 
---
Anet: gotchu fam, you can do it on any class now.
---
Thanks for informing us, Matt.
---
Map completion is more like an additional side quest that you can choose to do if you want. You won't really need it to progress but you can choose to do it for the extra exp
---
And realistically, gw2 uses a system where you still get pretty decent exp from doing low level content. There is a scaling factor but it's not super limiting. So go ahead and do it whenever you feel like you want to
---
I just wanted to thank everyone who commented on this post. It helped immensely and I now have a game plan moving forward. I'm getting my mount on my lvl 80 and then i'm gonna go back to one of my level 30s and start there. I deleted one character that was only 2 years old (most of my others are 4-5yrs old) in order to open up a character slot in case i wanna make a new character.  
---
Also, I have a character that is named after a historical figure. How likely is it that i'll get in trouble and have to change the name?
---
While the underwater mount option sounds cool, I'd like a mount that can carry multiple people.
---
That seems to just show what instabilities can be rolled, not what instabilities are actually rolled on any given day. 
---
This is awesome :) 
---
Mouse macros are on just about every gaming mouse these days.
---
Lower level areas give xp as quickly as any other. What you're experiencing is that the first few character levels (about 10) require significantly less xp to clear.
---
And how are you going to do it instead?  Given that not everyone jumps in on patch day and demolishes every achievement available.  If you take out the time gates and make it easily obtained, people like me 2 years later are going to ask for assistance with a champ/legendary mob and get nothing but crickets.
---
thx for suggestion bro
---
Sandswept Island Gathering Storms event [Group Event] Help Elder Rhona track down the source of the storm (80)  Elder Rahona and Elder Yowen don't move. Thank you.
---
it is still fairly crowded at least where I'm playing 
---
Worse than this? I highly doubt that, even if you play on the lowest possible settings, it would still be better than a blurry picture from a phone, You want us to identify something and you're simply making it harder for us to do so, Besides, does PC performance even impact screenshotting whatsoever?...
---
Does it give AP?
---
Some servers have either purple/yellow for Guild raids (closed for pugs)
---
And white for scouting reasons
---
Guessing I should just try and find an active guild then?
---
This game is a Solo players worst nightmare.
---
In-game LFG is 99% abandoned.
---
TESO's combat is by far less dynamic, but way more complex than gw2's. At least in PVE. Gw2's combat is just way to easy to solve.
---
If you want to go at it that way.. WoW had this very system even BEFORE GW2, Its not the same system and shouldnt be seen as such honestly, The Apex Ping system is fast, on the fly and available to everyone in the party
---
GW2 while you can bind it, you need to have a individual keybind for each thing, it would need a wheel to even be on par with Apex, Secondly, Im pretty certain its only usable by your groups Commander no?..
---
Try searching on forums or in /r/guildrecruitment
---
How so?
---
This is amazing. Much better than all the other fan art on this subreddit!
---
I'd really like an underwater mount, finally. Maybe some sort of seal or turtle...
---
I mean you have like 5 skills at that point. You can't really judger the entire combat system from that point.
---
Where so you see your participation? I have been out of the loop for many years when it comes to WvW, I only do small squads to cap camps and do dailies.
---
Please continue this comic series you have going, It's quite enjoyably.
---
Also have a Up vote.
---
Ahhh, like a PvE dynamic event with the orange circle and symbol?
---
I don't think I've ever once seen an event in WvW, but then again aside from my GoB, I haven't spent much time there.
---
How frequently do they spawn?
---
Which one?
---
The God left. LETS GET READY TO FUUUUUU-
---
You want the dragons have their way with Tyrians? I see another kinky plot twist here.
---
I think Borliss Pass. Basically a no-name for WvW that gets lumped into another bigger one for those purposes.
---
Have I played WvW? I doubt you will acknowledge grinding for legendary as "playing WvW", so I guess that answers it. But I do play a MMO FPS that is technically centered around the game mode (3 factions, armies of players, base caps, etc). I guess there is that dilemma of skipping over the inner walls. The amount of WvW I did play I realized how defending works. Whenever I'd participate in attacks or defending a base, during prime time, it would happen with a zerg blob that constantly moves and adjusts to the movements of the attacking zerg blob. I don't see this as a too big of a deal because very few bases have such layout where this is deemed possible, or at least, the bases I have thus far seen. 
---
I'm not really sure we need an API here, because there's no state to speak of - all the data is compiled into the bundle right now (check `src/lib/data` for details). Also, the whole thing runs on Gitlab Pages right now, which can only host static files. That said, if you have something specific in mind, feel free to open an issue and we can talk about it there instead of filling this thread with more nerd stuff :)
---
I am unsure how to feel about this.
---
I‚Äôve seen a lot of toxic comments from BOTH pve players and wvw players.
---
Yhea sure not new gemstore skin... no totally...
---
Now imagine there was a map cap on people who could do that LW story. And you had to wait in-game until it popped to play it.
---
Frankly it is really annoying to see post after post of non-WvWers saying "man why not be nice instead and we will play WvW more!" when literally all evidence is to the contrary.
---
It's not like WvW didn't exist before the mount. You just didn't want to play it.
---
&gt; What to do with this level of toxicity? 
---
We're still trying to work that out as a society tbh
---
This is a meme, try not to get too triggered by it: [https://imgflip.com/i/2vdhb0](https://imgflip.com/i/2vdhb0)
---
Don‚Äôt think most veteran WvW players stockpile reward potions 
---
Any pvp content has more toxic behaviour. Report and mute them.
---
Things get easily heated with this many players atm.
---
Only if I can report PvE players for not playing the game and complaining about WvWers which is about 100 times worse as they are preventing people who do want to play WvW from playing as well as not complaining.
---
Incoming Anet WvW hot fix in 2 months. 
---
I too was met with incredible disappointment.. but it was magical finally logging into GW2 during beta. I've not been excited about a game since the first and only Guild Wars. It may be a terrible sequel but it's still the best MMO there is.
---
grow a thicker skin, and block those people. if they become actually insulting, you can feel free to report them. collected a good few snowflakes from both sides myself on my blocklist.
---
I logged into WvW and saw someone calling everyone a moron. I reported them. I returned a week later, and they were there calling everyone morons.
---
You can report them, but I doubt it will do anything. I kind of get the feeling that they accept an extra level of toxicity given the competitive nature of the mode.
---
i think the option is called character chatter
---
Why wasn't it then?
---
Oh wait, no one actually cares about WvW.
---
Well, they‚Äôre account-wide if you beat the dungeon reward track!
---
happy cake day
---
If everybody has the same "OP mechanic", player number decide the outcome again. The bigger blob can cover a bigger area with their leaps and outright win.
---
Removed: This is a [duplicate post](https://redd.it/axwsny).
---
I'm out for a while. IS there any lore behind the Warclaw?
---
No.
---
It is frustrating as a PvE player to have things locked behind WvW. I avoid going in, as I don't want to ruin your play, but it sucks that I cannot get a single Gift of Battle to go with my 6 Gift of Explorations, and cannot get the new mount etc.
---
I wasn‚Äôt trying to make a big deal of it, just simply stating in the tone of sorts of, ‚Äúawe man that sucks.‚Äù And I wasn‚Äôt saying, ‚Äúmisleading/poor advertising‚Äù to incite a riot or grab your torches and pitch forks. Again just simply stating how I felt for all of a few seconds upon learning it was a skin set and not an armor set. I read the wiki, but I asked reddit, because I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was missing something or not understanding something correctly. There have been times when I try to reference the wiki and a particular detail and it isn‚Äôt answered within the wiki, such as how exactly to do this achieve, where exactly to do this thing, how exactly does this ability work. The only reason I wrote back the way I did to you was to clarify why I felt the way I did FOR THOSE FEW SECONDS OF ‚ÄúAWE SHUCKS, I was hoping to be wrong and shown that I was reading the wrong thing or conflating two different things.‚Äù
---
Ok I'll look at that.  I played around with different settings but nothing seems to affect that noise.
---
Haven't had a chance to see the Warclaw update yet but this post speaks to me. I enjoy WvW when I play it, but I never really see much actually happen - Bravos will change hands every 10 minutes, but that's apparently normal. Commanders will just kind of flip objectives, or defend key forts, but there doesn't really seem to be much of a point. In team chat, sometimes something unexpected will happen, like a T3 tower will get taken in some borderland out of nowhere, but it's never "well, that sucks, let's hit them back", it's "I had all my golems in there, all of you are worthless pieces of" etc. Glad someone felt like they were fighting for a reason.
---
I took Stonemist once with a modest zerg, and that was exciting - people in team chat were saying "don't bother, it's too well defended and we will just lose some other fort while you're there". But that commander was determined, and apparently Northern Shiverpeaks were distracted; they got there when we were already in the lord room and kinda got meat grindered in the choke. That rocked. But it only happened because someone felt like it on a whim, despite being told not to rock the boat -- and the only reward I got out of it was seeing team chat eat crow. Which was great, don't get me wrong, but it was kind of surreal to me that someone who actually had a plan was being told to sit down and go back to defending our perimeter. 
---
Maybe my server is just a bit shit; we are. But it seems kind of endemic to me; defending or capturing objectives gets you the generic participation, but if you make a risky play and get wiped, you get nothing. Not that you should be rewarded for fucking up -- but holding a fort is a lot easier than capping it, which encourages passive play. You get a bit more participation and a pitiful drop of karma for taking an objective, but otherwise the only advantage is tactical, and to be honest, it's usually wasted.

If the Warclaw has given people an incentive to actually make bold moves and go for high value targets, then that's awesome - but people will have their cats soon enough. I can't help but feel like there should be some sort of permanent incentive based on objectives rather than participation. 
---
Just spitballing here, but a liquid gold reward would be nice - if you capture an objective, you should get to pillage it. If it was a static sum, people would just flip them as fast as possible and probably tank the game's economy, but like...if an objective gave more gold depending on how long it had been before it changed hands, (capping at 24 hours, I'd think,) it'd promote striking at territories that would otherwise be seen as too hard. You should probably also get a scaling gold reward for playing defence too, but a smaller percentage of what you'd earn if you capped it. Maybe you get more if your guild owns the place you're defending. 
---
It wouldn't need to be a huge amount as it's alongside the steady participation rewards - but it should be enticing. Cutting your way through enemy territory and claiming reinforced objectives should definitely be more gold return than say, running the Silverwastes - these are arbitrary numbers, but let's say after an objective has been held for a day the gold scaling caps at, 1g for a camp, 2g for a tower, 4g for a keep and 8g for SMC. With defenders earning 10% or so of that for each attack repelled.
---
I'm going to assume I've missed a glaring issue with this that makes it exploitable - a zerg rushing to SMC to kill some joker with a battering ram and getting 80s for it seems a bit suspect - but if they're all there, then they might miss an actually legitimate threat somewhere else. It'd surely shake things up, anyway. I like WvW but usually I like it best when some maverick with a dorito is doing something weird - needs to happen more!
---
I will take as many mounts a they can produce :)
---
same with gale song, neither get upgraded from the new shout trait and neither get the boons that have been added to the shouts from this patch.
---
You might want to broaden your experience then to a rich node, vista and a WvW sentry or two.
---
Yes its up to Anet if they take it further. 
---
Yes, but nothing you can't catch up on once you're back.
---
I understand that now and I also understand that many times you are given skin charges to use on items to transmute them for free. But I wouldn‚Äôt say you have even more options than is normally expected. I thought you could transmute any skin from any item you have unlocked (soul bound/account bound) for any similar item/armor type? Except outfits since those are different and overwrite all armor skins.
---
Yea agree with Help_me. Personally I didn't like it when I first started so didn't do it. If you ever want 1st generation legendary weapons (check the wiki) you will need to do it. Having some of it done already is nice. But definitely nothing you have to do now.
---
This would be very awesome if they would fix the issues with them.
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/61706/musical-instrument-issues-since-nov-26-patch-merged
---
if it was only an upgradable armour, then you could use the skins only on that and nothing else, and you couldn't transmute the skins on any other armour. the way it's implemented gives you an armour set and the option to upgrade it's skins or use it on something else, so yes, way more options. and you can even always transmute the skin for a cost on any other gear.
---
the only thing I think they could've done better is to make it upgradable to ascended quality as well, but then it would have to cost a lot and this way it's easier to acquire for people not loaded with ascended materials.
---
GW2 core aka GW2 2012 is free. Expansions are buy to play. Anets business model is and has been buy to play since 2005.
---
MMOs have always had locust type players who will always play like that regardless of what you do. 
---
Time gates suck when you just want to dive into something for hours on end only to have to wait till the next day to progress. 
---
So true. The raid threads are always ridiculous. Either yelling the game needs to be raid focused , that the game IS raid focused , or just that raids are awesome yet also that the raid scene is dying because everyone else is a casual who is not as good as they are.
---
The problem with wvw aren't that its unpopulated, that is a symptom of the real problems.  People come and go in any game/mode.  No matter how good a game is people move on.  What's happened here is basically Anet has poured a bunch of water (pve players) into a bucket (wvw) with a really large hole (the real problems).  Does the bucket look full right now?  Sure, but it won't last very long.  
---
I agree that being toxic is a terrible idea and that we the wvw community should be welcoming new players with open arms.  But it still doesnt plug the gapping hole in the bottom of the bucket, it just makes the water rush out a little slower.
---
First and foremost, QA and DEV is not the same thing.
---
- dev: creates (whatever that means is proprietary to anet)
---
- QA: hired young adults who play video games for a few hours / day for money. 
---
The only people that know the game by heart is the die hard players. Not the QA testers. 
---
- The QA testers: know that if they find various bugs they get to keep their jobs and get paid a wage for said service. They make money. The QA testers is more likely to make arena net happy rather than the community simply because: the community doesn't pay them for their service directly (and we shouldn't).
---
Problems with QA: ethics are less important than money, making the community happy is less important than money because it's a job, they live it. Alarm clock, pack lunch, hop on bus etc..
---
- The community beta program: are only signing up for testing since they have: passion, spare time, it's fun, and importantly they want to help both parties. They feel a responsibility for the community more so than helping anet which means that, they will find bugs faster, they will be more efficient per hour, the reward is eternal as long as the game is alive. They have better ethics therefore. They work for fun. They don't do this for a living. They pay their own time to anet by helping them. 
---
Problems with community beta testing team: you need more of them... and that's it. 
---
Imagine someone with 8k hours in wvw and 25k ap testing the mount on a locked server with a new closed beta account. 
---
Imagine someone who set their alarm clock to go to work testing the mount in an office at anet. 
---
Go home, Arena net doesn‚Äôt pay for overtime. 
---
There are currently 2 expansions, heart of thorns (Hot) and path of fire (Pof), both are independent expansions meaning you can play the one without the other (storywise it does go Hot &gt; Pof).
---
HoT features :
---
- Gliding
---
- Jungle maps with a lot of verticality
---
- Big meta events on all of the maps
---
- 1 map dedicated to a huge world boss
---
- Acces to the new profession renevant
---
- 9 elite specialisations for all of the professions (1 per profession)
---
- Story
---
- Acces to living world season 3 (with gem purchase) 
---
PoF features:
---
- Mounts
---
- Desert maps with a lot of horizontality (it's a word i swear)
---
- Bigger maps than usual
---
- Story 
---
- 9 other elite specialisations
---
- Acces to living world season 4 (with gem purchase)
---
The living world system works by: every 3-4 months they release a new maps with story missions and a new legendary and usually also new weapons and armor sets, you unlock them for free if you log in during the 3-4 time span of that episode, if you miss an episode you have to purchase it with gems (you don't need to play the episode to unlock it, logging in is enough)
---
If you log in between now and ~1-2 months you unlock the current episode (living world season 4 episode 5 I believe)
---
Both expansions are worth it, for me PoF is the more valuable one because mounts that you can use everywhere in the core world as well
---
- sorry for formatting on phone
---
Well fucking sorry for using my local dialect. It's easier and rolls off the tongue better than "you guys" or "you all" and is even starting to gain traction as a genderless second person plural pronoun.
---
Utlimately, it's the same as "you're" or "we'll" or "shouldn't" and dozens of other contractions.
---
Pact supply merchants seems to be another case where it's just a lot of work to do it manually, and there's no other way to do it :( I'd love to see it happen myself, but we are somewhat limited by what the API lets us do here.
---
I‚Äôm confused...don‚Äôt people buy PoF for mounts?  You literally do the first part of the story for the raptor.  If you don‚Äôt have PoF you can‚Äôt get warclaw.
---
It‚Äôs literally quicker and easier to just get the raptor mount.  
---
Just elect them president, what's the worst that could happen? 
---
Considering its a real word and been used for almost 200 years now, you sound ignorant and uneducated.
---
At first I was just thinking "Oh that's kinda neat, but they go fast enough as it is." But after actually taking a look and seeing that it has little notes on exact directions of where to go or where you can find the fastest nodes I see that this is actually pretty damn awesome. Thanks for the hard work!
---
&gt; something with your map design is probably not very good
---
Very flawed logic. Players are *locusts*. If left unchecked they will grind themselves into hole as fast as possible and quit and move on. There is a reason why there is a loot cap, a reason why you can only get meta rewards once a day. Time gating might be annoying but its a way to get the player to keep coming back. 
---
the base game is free, and that gets you 2 character slots, access to max level, some end game content (fractals, dungeons, PvP, WvW), and 8/9 character classes
---
You need to buy each separate expansion after that. The first expansion is Heart of Thorns, the second is Path of Fire. Generally you can find them bundled together. Check [here](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers/#UnitedStates-physical) for the list of retailers that sell the game, one of them might have a sale.
---
Once purchased, you have unlimited access to the game, no subscription. 
---
The living world seasons are the quarterly content patches to the game. If you're online within the 3 month span before the next episode releases, you unlock the current one for free. So currently, we're on season 4, episode 5. If you sign on before episode 6 comes out (which we don't have a date for yet anyways), then you'll unlock episode 5. Any episodes that you weren't online for you do have to buy. It's 200 gems (microtransaction currency) per episode, and you can get 800 gems for $10 or by converting in game gold to gems
---
As for microtransactions, it is largely just cosmetic and the occasional QoL convenience like an unlimited gathering tool or a more private town hub. 
---
Gothic I by Piranha Bytes.
---
A friend gave me that game a long time ago. It was in German. 
---
I didn't understand a lick of German. 
---
I somehow finished it, completed all quests, and even managed to understand the plot. And that was back when I didn't have Internet to search for translations or walkthroughs.
---
I still don't know German, except when playing the Gothic franchise. Sometimes I remember repetitive lines from Gothinc like "Ich muss gehen" or "Zeig mir deine Ware" when playing other games.
---
I‚Äôd recommend just playing the free version - if the world and the gameplay grab you, then feel free to buy cosmetic upgrades via the gem store - they all help the devs. While you‚Äôre learning the world, playing through the (quite good) Personal Story, perhaps dabbling in WvW or even PvP, and, of course, leveling your character(s), you can look out for specials on the Expansions - both require you to have at least 1 max-leveler character to use, so there‚Äôs no reason to get them until you‚Äôre sure you want to commit to leveling that high. (Well... both Expansions DO come with ‚ÄòInstant Level 80‚Äô tokens, but I think they‚Äôre best when you‚Äôve organically leveled to that point personally). 
---
Overall, you‚Äôll probably notice that while there are many, many ways to ‚Äòmonetize‚Äô your account in GW2, all of them are truly OPTIONAL. I‚Äôve also never seen anyone shamed (or overly lauded) for anything they purchased for real money or for in-game currency (not even Legendaries, which are indeed cool, but are, stats-wise, the same as stuff you can get for FAR less money/effort). In that respect, GW2 has always been something of an anomaly: a game truly made FOR gamers, with mechanics that skew towards removing BS, Grundy tasks and overt, forced monetization. 
---
That‚Äôs why I keep playing, and why I usually but a few gems every other month - to reward ANet‚Äôs respect for their audience. 
---
Good luck and hope you have a blast! 
---
It's rated PvP, so unranked or ranked. No need to worry about season.
---
Look man, Ill tell you the fist thing I learned about WvW: Its full of salt. Mind you, the majority of people are respectable, but there are those who are still figuring thier life out. Just report and move on. Find a WvW Guild that has mic support so you can turn off chat completely.
---
but does it save the wall/gate?
---
I'd love to see "I pressed 1 a lot" title, after you did that like 10k times at open world meta events. Maybe as a April's Fool title.
---
Ahhh! Ah! Ho ho ho!

IVE GOT SO MUCH TO DO

animal control took it away

The question is why are you so triggered?

Are you looking for a reason to be offended or playing a F'n game?

Good God you snowflake

Removed: Please use the [bug thread](https://redd.it/axx9ed).
---
Mistlocl sanctuary has dibs on fractal entry but doesn't have entry to wvw. So unless it does get access to wvw stuff directly and an arena you shouldn't expect the wvw place to have fractal stuff imo
---
not sure if youre aware or if this is a different person entirely but kyle used to be a prominent member of the wvw/gvg community a long time ago. he could be pretty confused that people still recognize him all this time later lol. [link to old channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/GW2NAGVG/videos?disable_polymer=1)
---
You need PoF to get warclaw 
---
What else is it good for?
---
I think that's how most cats treat everything you own. My big cat sometimes sits on my arms when I'm on the computer: even your *own body* isn't safe from them.
---
No wait I figured out what was giving it to me. The Blast Gyro is also a launcher and sometimes it can hit random objects and give you superspeed. So Blast Gyro by itself gives no superspeed at all.
---
I mean the mount took me ten minutes after I was finally able to get through the queue. Granted I had a ton of pots, but it's really not that bad.
---
Seeing full PvE zergs taking on full PvE zergs was just...something else to behold. Entire zergs swallowed whole in seconds because they don't know how to group or that AoE gets stuff done.
---
Don't even begin to get me started on their inability to use group spells to help one another prep. Just full steam ahead, no prep. No speed boosts while on the move. No coordination. Just a school of fish swimming straight into the mouth of a hungry shark, time and time again, and complaining that they "can't kill that one Camp guard, it must be bugged" despite repeatedly being told "he's under the effects of Righteous Indignation. Only PvEr's are burning spells on him. Everyone else is chilling and waiting for the next minute until he's vulnerable."
---
I'm a noob myself but man, comparatively, I feel like I've come a long way. I can see why longterm vets get so flustered. Screaming in team chat isn't okay, but I can at least see why they're getting so frustrated at least.
---
Been using this preset for a while and love it.

---
Armistice technically doesn't give access to WvW either though. No waypoints on the map so it's the same entry as from anywhere else.
---
For the roaming community this means absolutely nothing. Just more people joining the karma trains.
---
Big if true
---
It spoils the story for sure but why would someone buy pof and not start the story?  Isn‚Äôt that the point?
---
But do they high five like the kittens?
---
There also used to be a time when games had ingame rewards not wallet rewards.
---
You are demeaning and rewording things I say:
---
Community beta program vs community testing. 
---
What you are doing is that you make my idea sound like I want them to release everything and then the community will report everything for no extra reward in doing so, no. That is not what I am saying.
---
I bet you that you could get 500 players to sign up for a quality assurance program by offering them an in game mini.. you would be required to have X amount of time in said testing area etc etc.. professionally doing it not like how you are implementing my words.. ffs..
---
But anyways.. 
---
If we are insulting each other rather than discussing a simple topic then my suggestions to you is to read a little about these topics:
---
- Basic math
---
- History, chapter: Industrialism 
---
- Econ 101
---
- Business 101
---
- Intro to psych 101
---
- Business ethics 101
---
Good day to you. 
---
roleplaying doesnt require class balance or is that too much information for you to process?
---
Genious. Now do the story to the mission "The Departing" to tell them Twitchy Jake sent you.
---
Yikes
---
Every day we stray further from Dwayna‚Äôs light
---
&gt; since you get something at the end
---
When you complete an explorable area (not a city), you get negligible coin, experience, two pieces of gear, some mats or map currency, and either a transmutation charge or a Black Lion chest key.
---
Do it if you‚Äôre interested in those rewards; otherwise, feel free to explore other zones.
---
That said, completing cities is not a bad idea. They don‚Äôt take much time, and they give experience and a transmutation charge.
---
&gt; Time-gating a chore
---
Is it a chore though?  I mean, yeah they're heart quests, but to complete the hearts you just have to... play the game.  It doesn't change anything if it's repeating the heart 16 times or making it 'kill 1000 inquest'. Same thing, different name.
---
I like when they are genuine . this is not. this was deliberate. 
---
Thanks will check these suggestions out. Thanks again
---
All they have to do is make the inner wall a little bit higher than the top of the outer wall. All they have to do is select the wall 3D models in the map builder and raise them a unit or two (the models are individual pieces and stick through the floor with extra length). Then the kitty will proceed to faceplant into the wall lmao. Such embarrass, very pain, wow.
---
I guess what your saying is if someone bought pof with no interest in starting the story  (once again confused on why they bought it but that‚Äôs another issue) they could go into wvw and get warclaw.  Sure.
---
My friend got "I Key Freely" a couple months ago, surprised that wasn't taken
---
Lol @ toxicity
---
&gt; What do I need to know about the expansions and free-to-play vs paid?
---
Why would you care at all if your goal in game is   
---
&gt;  to play mainly for the fun of playing the game
---
?   
---
This is a serious question. If you are not intending to be hardcore or competitive, even if the game has the most rectal pay to win shop, that is just of so little concern to you as to be irrelevant.   
---
That said, you should be looking at buying both expansions to maximize the fun value. Core content was stale and boring even back in 2012 and it didn't get better with the years. On top of that, both expansions add cool systems like gliding or mounts. You'd want those to maximize enjoyment. 
---
Why are you downplaying the additions? Elite specs and new mechanics make the game feel fresh. The LS model is very stale. There is a reason people get hyped for xpacs. 
---
Your R (special action key) skill is like a tonic and replaces your action bar with shortcuts to port you around the map. The skills are stuff like 1 = go to the TP/Bank area, 2 = crafters, 3 = WvW vendors, 4 = dueling arena, etc. (I don't have them memorized, these are just approximations). It's nice imo because the map isn't super compact and cramped, and it's really quick to move around.
---
thats one of the best bugs ive ever heard of
---
&gt;Pictures won't change a thing, I know what Balthazar looks like.
---
well forgive my skepticism as you seemingly dont recognise balthazars most distinguishing (and consistent) feature
---
&gt; And the axe is a Kormir weapon, not a Balthazar weapon.
---
i never said it was; i was trying to say the shield is most likely a kormir weapon (just like how the focus is most likely a dwayna weapon despite having no discernible motifs)
---
Actually I heard purchasing content unlocks some QoL factors like more inventory space etc.
---
You like ESO more then gw2?
---
Condition builds have the same amount of skills and abilities as power builds. Power builds like Deadeye, Warrior, Soulbeast, rely on 1-3 skill chains that do a majority of their damage, where a condition build uses their full toolkit to apply conditions and keep them from falling off.
---
Scrapper was over buffed, at least for structured PvP. they were good changes, but with a Mender‚Äôs amulet and the right traits it‚Äôs overpowered.
---
And, really, Scrapper is the most brain dead support I‚Äôve ever played. One weapon set, utilities, toolkit skills, that‚Äôs it. A monkey could play Scrapper and do it at a Plat level.
---
Some of my raid group does key farms with the ugliest or outrageous character designs for entertainment.
---
DirectX from June 2010?
---
Guys this was to be expected. It will get fixed in due time. You can even jump over that wall as a dragon hunter. 
---
They also charge you money or a subscription for their living world updates. So they have a lot more monetary incentive to make the content. 
---
GW2's gemstore is extremely generous and people still complain about it.
---
No, I have the problem since I have Win 10
---
I got key me up scotty
---
Meanwhile I got kicked multiple times in a playing session because of who knows what(setting client port doesn't help and its only game o get dcs in) and had to reque just to stay in que for most of my playtime because system doesn't remember if I was there.
---
Pretty much made me quit again 
---
Yes. Love this. 
---
I feel like the easier solution would be to increase the height proportionally for all structures by a small enough margin to make a difference. Doing it for specifically that wall would be more work than they would need to do. And if they‚Äôre not adjusting the width it shouldn‚Äôt impact how the pieces merge together. 
---
Does she have her own series now?
---
The fact that you expect someone new to do all that, when their interest hasn't even been piqued yet (because it's something new to them...something they are doing outside of their comfort zone), and they are already being berated by the self-proclaimed "WvWers", says a lot.
---
What's difficult is agreeing with your presented argument, when you can't even begin to relate to those people. You'd be a pretty bad teacher, leader, and mentor with that kind of mentality and lack of empathy.
---
They keep telling me Order ID
---
Last four digits (ONLY) of the credit/debit card used
---
PayPal¬Æ Invoice ID associated with the purchase
---
Billing Address including Zip/Postal Code. Even though I have never bought the standard edition with PayPal or card
---
Do capped farms and then focus on one material. Always do home instance daily. For all the farm routes I used tekkits taco routes.
---
 http://www.tekkitsworkshop.net/index.php/gw2-taco/download
---
My farm was usually Blood Ruby farm with 1 and a half chars. hablion, Jades + Unstable Anomaly. 
---
- &gt; Lake Doric farm route, takes about 2 and a half characters.
---
-&gt; Petrified Wood farm route on 1 char and a bit more on 2nd then hearts while looking out for Dominator, sloth and wyrm.
---
-&gt; Draconis Mons hearts for Druid Stones and orchids, all the hearts took me about 15min. I didn't have to farm these beyond doing daily hearts since Wayfarer's Henge was my biggest timegate.
---
Those are what I did daily, atleast the farm routes if I only had little time.
---
After those you choose which material to focus and farm. Winterberries you can get by running the farm route 5 times since you get about 50 per run. Orrian Pearls you can do the farm or do hearts + gamble.
---
Petrified Wood you can farm on alts by doing hearts and at the same time looking out for Dominator, Sloth and Wyrm.
---
Blood Rubies you can farm 9 per alt by doing Hablion and Bloodstone Maw (jades+anomaly). The Bloodstone Maw starts again exactly 1h after the last one ended but is on unique timer per instance, there really never is a 2nd instance so you can set a timer for the next alt. Hablion usually spawns during the maw so you can do him after.
---
Jades you can farm with hearts and some events but it was never necesseary for me.
---
Orchids you can do the hearts and farm route more I think but I never needed to.
---
I'd pay $100 right now for my griff to be able to easily maintain and gain altitude.  Just soaring around maps is the main thing on my wish list.
---
Hey, why not a friggin' HORSE??
---
&gt; Windows 10 mostly: please download and unpack the following ***D3DX9_43.DLL*** (extracted from a .cab file within the ***DirectX June 2010*** package) and place it within your bin64 folder as well (don't ask me why some windows 10 have newer versions of this DLL which fails to load for some odd reason).
---
I stopped understanding those bandit names after all those several-hour keyfarm sessions back in the day. 
---
This seems like op is a true wvw'er and bandwagoning the wvw'ers are toxic alliance (I think it is the FC server now).  I was running around at reset in wvw and I didn't really see that much team/map chat trolling/toxicity over what is normally there among the usual people that play team chat instead of actually playing the game mode.  Granted my server is paired with Kaineng who is making a push for T5 and at reset last night the only que was on the EB map. 
---
There was no waiting to get the mount done for the bottom wvw server.  
---
Massive pvp? No no. Wrong
---
I actually took a different character into wvw and spent a point, then it triggered so that's also an option :) 
---
Bullwark Gyro is mad. 
---
Using it with boosted A.E.D allow you to have one or the other permenantly going with very little downtime.
---
Blast gyro is meh at best and not worth using at worst, shreder gyro does far more damage and has a whirl finisher you can combine with its spare capacitor for massive damage.
---
Heal gyro is kinda shitty, pulseheal isn't that big and basic heal is also bad.
---
Pulse and sneak gyro are basically what I was expecting from either of them.
---
The entire set looks to be very fun in PvP and I can't wait to test it.
---
Besides scrapper what spec is garbage in pve from HoT
---
Yea I get it now lol 
---
I wasn‚Äôt trying to argue I was just confused lol if someone bought both xpacs and don‚Äôt want to start pof until completing the story leading up to it, by all means get warclaw.  That‚Äôs all the OP needed to say, and there‚Äôs no way to stop someone from doing that.....so if that‚Äôs what you want to do, do it.
---
I've scoured Hills over and over, can't find it either.  
---
I feel the same, I really dislike the shiro line, but it's used so much for power builds
---
I usually do the celeb names with a "key" somewhere, like Keyfer Sutherland, Keylie Jenner or Keyndrick Lamar.
---
Copypasta is not being toxic
---
I tweaked a few things with the Tekkit version of the farming engineer, popped al VIT+ infusions and hopped on WvW and I'm having so much fun running around with the zerg. I'ts not a dedicated healer or assaulter, but instead a very powerful condition cleansing machine and a damage sponge.  
---
The new skills restored my faith in engi \\ 0 /
---
This is why I think NCSoft stepping in and cutting loose a bunch of staff might be the only chance WvW has. It's been terrible like this for years and years (PvP too). Bugs that haven't gotten fixed, and those that do takes months or years to get done. Quarterly balance patches at best, some taking even longer, and generally ignore any PvP/WvW issues. 
---
IMO, this is it for WVW unless NCSoft makes some changes and WvW/PvP actually gets some support. I'll wait a few weeks to see what happens, but then I'll probably be gone. It's a shame, this is by far the best combat game-play I've ever played in an MMORPG, but it's just horribly unbalanced and gets virtually no support. 
---
I see your Point, but couldnt the full Focus on LS actually avoid quite some of These Problems?
---
It‚Äôs a different kind of combat, to me it feels faster at max level than gw2 (especially on pvp), also you have about 1/4 of all your class abilities/talents, which makes the play style of every class very different from what you would have at max level

Question from a noob who registered with an old Heroic Edition from 2013:

how much does a Living World Season cost in the Gem Store?

hyperbole found help you get your point across

Report them if yu must.

Maybe try a different playstyle for necro? Reaper has seen some buffs since scourge came out. Scourge support is a thing in raids as well. Scourge was pretty strong in WvW for a while, not sure on it's current position after last couple patches though. Either way just keep him around for later 
---
wow, such a great exploit, using these techniques you can get yourself killed instantly, literally overpowered
---
At a glance, it doesn't really do anything Vuetify's grid system doesn't do. Might be missing something though.
---
yeah fully agree on that. but that's everywhere a thing. once people communicate, some cocky highbrought a-holes will act that way. may be a bad day, a bad life or whatever, does not really matter. cannot really hide these bullying, best u can do is to post a "chill down bruh" so the newbies don't feel fully hated :D  
---
I'm also rather new, but i played much wvw yet the last two months. i was the definition of cannon fodder in the beginning , but with specific builds etc u can be usefull till good gear drops. and u also learn to take care of gankers and oneshotscummer builds by time. not that they'd be avoidable always, but yeah ;P

If you have 4 cards in a row where one is, let's say double the height of the rest of them, you'll have a lot of empty space under shorter cards. Masonry arranges them so that there is no empty space. :)
---
If you don't have any of them i would definitely go with harp. It is (IMO) by far the most versatile instrument. If you want to test how they work before taking the plunch you can look to the [Magnanimous Choir Bell](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Magnanimous_Choir_Bell) which can be bought as a [Bell case](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Wintersday_Red_Musical_Bell_Case) through the TP for a few silver.
---
It is a good recommendation. I completely misread what you originally wrote I apologize.
---
Because they're boring? Horses don't teleport through sand portals or let you execute sick drifting tech. 
---
[Also because horses are extremely rare and potentially extinct](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Horse). A more cynical man than I might think that horses aren't supposed to exist, but that the writers occasionally slip up and drop a reference to them without thinking. They've never featured heavily in the main plot and they've never appeared in-game. All we've got are a few references in text, mostly in the form of ambient dialogue, one mention from a holiday NPC, a footnote from a novel, a few footprints in the dirt, and comparisons between them and centaurs.
---
I'm just seconding your opinion to emphasize that repeatable hearts are the worst adition to this game.

Guild Wars 2: The Game: The Movie - The Soundtrack, Remastered.
---
Try power reaper for open world. Shroud skill 4 melts anything it touches, GS skill 4 does increasing massive AoE, use the Rise shout for defense, it's like playing a frosty blender of death. I use the healing and elite summons too. 
---
Well, see?? Now its balanced! :D
---
You are correct that the mount is wvw exclusive and can therefore be tweaked specific to wvw. They could even split the warclaw‚Äôs characteristics per game mode as is the current standard for balancing profession skills and such. However, a blanket movement change to the mount if not split could still affect pve. In addition we are not just trying to fix the mount. There are jumping issues regarding passing walls that should not be passable with many other profession skills. So yes we could nerf the warclaw‚Äôs leap, but since we are not fixing the root cause of the problem, what do we do about all the other professions that can bypass walls in countless other locations? The way to fix this entirely is to raise the walls, adjust terrain heights, and or even add little decorations that block access to cheeses. Anet has already demonstrated this is possible by raising the wall at the south part of kessex hills, they did this to prevent mounts from going over them. And map break holes have been plugged with additional terrain pieces or decorations. Good news is they have the tools. :D
---
Oh, right, let me get my whole zerg mounted and jump into this one. 
---
Yes it should be fixed.
---
2 months? Is it PvP? WvW will take at least half a year. 
---
I agree, having no chance of getting ressed by a mount seems pretty dumb, especially when u cant cc people running at you on a mount. 
---
That's a name I haven't seen in forever.  I remember he was part of the gvg scene (I think he was in EP?)  Used to see him everywhere years ago when we were on the same server.  Didn't know he still played.
---
&gt; You can want to fuck your character but why do you think others want to hear your kinks?
---
the hell are you on about? its called comedy
---
I made this same suggestion on my post (https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ay48cu/the_warclaw_is_a_blast/?st=JSXQO5JT&amp;sh=ee573beb) aside the fact that I don‚Äôt think stomping downed players is a bad thing.
---
yall got any sweet tea?
---
I've recently got Venom (Kraitkin precursor) as a random drop. It is worth about 40g on the trading post, while the legendary trident is worth about 1800g. I have no interest in this legendary.  
---
In your personal opinion, is it worth it to craft the legendary just to sell it, since I already got the pre?
---
And now it's on reddit, the tactic's more likely to get screwed ...
---
So let me get this straight.. we've got chickens, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs, but horses are not supposed to exist?
---
I like this suggestion the best. 
---
No worries man :)
---
completely forgot to reply but thank you for introducing me to lemon demon
---
That doesn't tell us anything, since those 10% could be mostly the same few people.
---
That would be silly :). Debuff after leaching raid boss, leach.
---
You're right though as of right now the builds have not changed and they are the same builds as other sites like metabattle. I appreciate the PvP specific guides godsofpvp has, do you have a better suggestion or another good PvP resource that is up to date?
---
now i wonder what the Asura male genitalia looks like. for science.
---

---
&gt; You can already set a specific keybind for each mount.
---
I know and that's what I did (it is also implied by my original message).
---
But since 6 out of 7 mounts can't be used in wvw, I'd like to use the same keybind as one of those for the Warclaw specifically in wvw (while still having a distinct one for pve).
---
If you have enough WvW potions (I'd say 70-75~), then its about 20 minutes in best case.
---
Keep achievement may take some time, but with EotM its should not be a big problem.
---
Even if they gave mounts a CC bar like the banners. 
---
&gt; (and auto-hide minis in WvW only)
---
***YES!***
---
&gt; The importance of this may increase once the Alliance System is in place, as your PvE guild you‚Äôre repping when entering WvW, may be opposition to the WvW guild your WvW alliance is based on. We don‚Äôt know exactly how they‚Äôre designing the system, but it does have foreseeable issues.
---
this actually won't be an issue at all. your wvw guild/alliance association is gonna be unrelated to your currently represented guild, that much we know.
---
Was thinking of going scourge with mercy runes for raid training 
---
My group is starting with Vale Guardian, Is the the best build to use: https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/necromancer/scourge/heal/ ?
---
Or are there better scourge builds for raid training?
---
Please, stop ...
---
There was a patch just yesterday so probably nothing's fully up to date but in general metabattle is the better PvP resource. At first glance I can tell godsofpvp has the utilities wrong for both necromancer builds and the rune for weaver.
---
Insta stomp is crappy mechanic in any case. Today i got into 30 on 20 fight where 30 were pve pugs and 20 organized guild party. I was able to jump in as soon those 20 had 2-3 downed, finish them and reset. They lost eventually and only coz of stupid mount insta stomps. 
---
So in this scenario , skilled ppl lost due to really bad mech. To me that is not right.
---
Yeah this is an urgent hot fix for a game breaking bug. Better to just not fix it. 
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying and yet, downvoted to oblivion.
---
I like the changes. The cooldowns are way too low, though. 
---
They spam a lot of blind, to counter it you need to 1: not get hit by it in the first place, 2: attack fast enough that you clear the blind (first attack while blinded misses but the following attacks will hit), 3: cleanse the condition, or 4: use resistance to ignore it. Usually if you're melee you want something that hits quickly or if you can apply conditions that continue to deal damage.
---
so like a whale exclusively for Quaggan? 
---
I'm not complaining about the lack of possible keybinds. There are plenty, and I already chose one.
---
I'm asking for a wvw-specific one so it would let me use the same key as one of the pve-only mounts while in wvw, without conflict. And it wouldn't prevent summoning it in pve too : as I said in OP, I'll use a 2nd keybond for that (= the one I already set)
---
A noob player who probably is gonna zerg with the tag: I‚Äôm just here for Gift of Battle...
---
to be fair could probably mesmer port
---
I'm sorry. but the only person that is making it weird. is you. when I read this comic, I see this as adult humor. that is it. nothing is connected to any kinky fantasies that you or others are making it out to be.
---
About 4 hours for me with 25 potions from Black Lion Chests.
---
Those of us playing wvw for long, gave up on reporting hackers, toxic, rude, well we gave up on reports :/.
---
It used to be that you'd lose all participation on leaving wvw, so often you'd see people idle around after a session waiting for it to tick down while they gain rewards
---
Errrrr, I actually see tons of players who look like this and I can assure you that they're not just holosmiths
---
My keyfarmer is "A Horse".
---
Every time I start a new run the first thing I do is equip the Deer Commander title.
---
So it depends, I personally think the snowcrows build is the best option since it does it's job very well and still provides some damage. If you wanted there are more pure heal versions like [metabattle's](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Scourge_-_Support_Healer) but I would still suggest gearing the snowcrows build.
---
You can bypass using the mount in both outer and inner walls on Hills. One or two people can just take a keep without using any siege, without anyone noticing.
---
There's no need for personal attacks.
---
I agree that it's better to inspire newer players than to berate them, but there is a reality on the ground that the vast majority do not or are unable to (for a variety of reasons, some of which can be personal) take the first steps towards success. What is success? I believe that we play this game to have fun, and the best way to have fun in WvW is to kill the bad guys. The best way to kill lots of bad guys is to get organized, use strong builds, and to fight as a team. So I pose a question to you: what do you do when no matter how hard you yourself try your team isn't able to win fights?
---
Some players log off or play a different game. Others try to help teammates that might be struggling or change classes to improve the comp. Some change the mental victory condition to capturing a structure or denying something to the bad guys. And then there are a vocal minority of players that resort to venting their frustration in chat or deflecting their frustration onto strangers. Sound familiar?
---
It's easy and understandable to criticize people for being rude or insensitive, especially in a medium like team chat. But I think we should challenge ourselves to understand why someone might say the things that they do, why one's opinion can become so polarized, and why there might be a random guy typing in all caps in team chat telling PvErs to get out. Who knows, maybe some of us can try to teach those newcomers or provide resources to improve. :)
---
Mounted enemies are easy downs though, so maybe just remove the finish and leave it be lol
---
its fine as it is learn to adapt
---
That's fair. It certainly would have notably detracted from my experience, personally, but you're right that it isn't huge.
---
Tested. It doesn't look like it.
---
Thanks, greg. You're a real hero. What about next week's lottery numbers while you're in a prescient mood?
---
The biggest issues that I've noticed so far are:
---
* Willing roamer versus unwilling mounted target is unbalanced in favour of the unwilling target
---
* Engage skill is OP in mounted groups, especially vs. downed
---
* Can be used to skip terrain
---
Aside from the last one, these all seem like simple fixes. Adjust # of targets, HP amount, damage.
---
Obviously the meta game is going to change now that zerglings can return to a fight faster than before and more safely, but the jury is still out on that being a negative change and as someone who felt like WvW moved at a snail's pace at the best of times, I welcome it.
---
Kyle is an awesome dude, played in guilds with him before, really wholesome guy
---
It's funny, but on the other hand ..... \*how dare\*
---
I know there‚Äôs a generic ‚Äúmount up‚Äù button that just puts you on the currently equipped mount, since there‚Äôs only the Warclaw in WvW, you can use that button, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing.
---
You do realize that metabattle builds list the same utility skills for all 3 builds as gods right? They just list the utility and rune options down below, these builds really haven't changed much at all. Like the leadership rune is still listed in the mender weaver build as an option for better boons and now with the update changing all stats on runes it got a minor buff even. I do agree that staff on reaper should be a GS though, don't know what's up with that (and that would mean swapping off the mark trait).
---
If you are not hard committed to heal scourge, just grab some exotic magi with mercy runes. The damage loss isn't terribly relevant, and mercy runes are absurd if you are doing a significant amount of resing.
---
The SnowCrows build will perform a bit better in experienced groups, but for training I would recommend going full healer.
---
200 gems if bought individually, if you buy the whole season you get it at discounted price.
---
For you...
---
Well sand lions give you a lot of blind conditions cause sand in this game blinds, either stun them while not blinded and nuke them 
---
or use abilities that can bypass the blind condition
---
I like how it has picked up the pace of fights. Whether you win or lose the fight, you can get right back into another objective quickly.
---
&gt;since 6 out of 7 mounts can't be used in wvw, I'd like to use the same keybind as one of those for the Warclaw
---
Because only 1 mount can be used in WvW, keybind for your primary mount up (for me that's jackal) will summon the warclaw in WvW. So you already got this. 
---
Yes it will work, keys aren't region locked.
---
Just buy the UK versions just to be safe. Usually UK prices are cheaper than US. PoF was cheaper in ¬£s than $s.

&gt; You do realize that metabattle builds list the same utility skills for all 3 builds as gods right?

No I don't.

Steps to having a better (and potentially good) time in WvW:
---
Step 1: decide what not to give a **** about in WvW 
---
Step 2: stop giving a **** about it 
---
Step 3: carry on with your task in WvW
---
The same applies to life in general. 
---
Same with FA. Xunlai secret agent you prick.

the endless amount of downtime was what ultimately drove me away from wvw back in mid 2013. the walks were long and boring and because of that many Comms avoided fights completely on my server. they rather captured an unmanned objective than risk having to walk back across the map. this completely drained all fun for me so I stopped and only occasionally gave it a try again. I still keep a roamer and zerg build up to date so I can hop in whenever, but yesterday was the first time in a long while I actually had fun again in wvw, there were constant fights, and if I died I could get back to fighting pretty quickly. other roamers were much more eager to fight as well (instead of running away as soon as it looked bad for them). today I went zerging and had a blast, there was constant back and forth instead of short burst of fighting followed by 10 minutes of nothing.
---
The problem with istan it was vastly superior farming spot compared to other maps, which makes huge junk of players constantly be there, now these people may spread out across other map which in turn makes content more accessible for everyone else. Do you really need a farm map like istan ? 
---
Here is the deal, I am aware of how the casual player is, but i am sry to say, last nights team chat had nothing to do with how bad people were.
---
It was a disaster before people got into the first fight, not sure what reason was for that, I would understand, a hour in, things are ridiculous, there may be some toxicity but as soon as you zone in after patch is WvW ers insulting new players.
---
UK seems to be the most expensive at least for buying from DLGamer
---
US - $37 USD
---
UK - ¬£36 GBP ($47 USD)

Euro - ‚Ç¨37 euro ($42 USD)

What class/profession should I go for if I want to focus mainly on pvp? My choices are either Thief, Holo engineer, or Revanant? I like something that's bursty but can also survive well and is good for WvWs, Conquest, Dueling, etc.. also which one of these 3 is the non repetitive one thats also fun? 
---
Yes, but he will earn some while doing achievements. 
---
#Love4ArenaNet Such beauty was possible be made with your work in this amazing game. You're remembered and not forgotten, and we'll always be grateful for everything you did. I hope you're in a better place now.
---
(The credits goes to the video's owner) 
---
Nice, except the first SoI will probably not apply alacrity.
---
First shield 5 returning wave applies alacrity. Delaying SOI in CS also serves to wait for the return wave.
---
I know this may be difficult for some players to understand, but some of us find those types of farms fun. There are a lot of players out there who find satisfaction in material rewards, not in any perceived opportunity of experience. I'm one of those players. For all of the good ideas this game has, homogeneous loots tables are a terrible idea. It means that you either have to make all content equally as rewarding, or not rewarding at all.
---
I'm not a big fan. I don't do WvW roaming very often, but I feel like I'm being robbed of what can make my class good ( mobility ). It became almost impossible to prey on slow people behind zergs now. 
---
If there were 3 people downed on that guildgrp they allrdy played not that good, getting downed should somehow be punishable.
---
Here's a better way to get your dailies done in like 10 minutes: queue for an unranked pvp match and win it.
---
don't forget to stretch!
---
üòèand enjoy your new life.
---
This comment is stupid:
---
1) There aren't always players around defending a tower. This way, you can solo take a tower without siege.
---
2) A mesmer can port a bloody zerg inside.
---
This is like when some AoE heals worked on defeated players. It should just not happen.  
---
Considering ANet's current shacken state, the least we can do is some beta testing until they iron out these bugs.
---
Oh. People should get used to using "Defeated".  
---
It is shorter than "Fully dead".  
---
You can write it with one hand and faster than 'fully dead'.
---
And it's even more accurate, since players are almost never dead, only mostly dead. And [mostly dead is slightly alive](https://youtu.be/d4ftmOI5NnI?t=38).  
---
So it goes like this:  
---
* Downed.
---
* Defeated.
---
* The Departing.
---
&gt;  If you are joining a group strictly looking for experienced players, as an inexperienced player, then you are the problem...not the community.
---
This is the same as in wvw.  There are pug tags, and guild tags.  Guild tags will sometimes run semi-open, where they allow people to join, but they expect you to know what you're doing, because if you don't and you die you are giving the other team an advantage. You can be effecting more than just 9 people's time.
---
I've literally seen level 40 rangers running with pug tags and no one cares. They are pretty much the equivalent to pve training raids, where people will help you if you ask, and no one expects you to be experienced.  As you said,
---
&gt;The situation and context MATTERS.
---
Thx! Will go after the weapons first then and then the armor! :)
---
It's righteously strong and makes duo roaming ridiculously. Can have one person hold aggro, one disengage, mount, chase, pounce, instant finish if they're below the HP threshold of ~2.8k.
---
The worst part is it just widens the gap between veterans and new players.
---
I would just have the mount lose endurance in enemy territory.  That would prevent jumps, and give defenders a chance to catch up to people on mounts.
---
Fuck, who can keep track anymore.  Seems like the spec has to relearn everything every balance patch.
---
Either everything is ok to say or nothing is.
---
With no potions and in eotm, 22 hours. in normal borderlands 17 hours. With boosters like 6-7 hours.
---
[Us hoarders do.](https://i.imgur.com/xH3NXCY.png) It's a good way to waste space in your inventory and ensure you're always over encumbered.
---
It's a little handy when holidays or events roll around with a special reward track that you just want to whip out and get back to your usual track without worrying about whether you'll have enough time.
---
Sylvari confirmed kralk minions

Watching WvW gameplay without those aids scourge aoes is a complete different experience.
