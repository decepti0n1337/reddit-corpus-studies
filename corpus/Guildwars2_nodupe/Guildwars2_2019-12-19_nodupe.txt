Hi Nikey

&gt;A-net is not a big company
---

---
yes they are... even after the layoffs theyre still massive.
---
The problem is that the gemstore takes away from your enjoyment whether you use it or not.
---
The core problem with GW2 has never been that it lacks content. GW2 has lots of content. It's that it can't seem to find good ways to incentivize / reward people for playing that content. GW2 has never found a consistent way to offer meaningful rewards without the vertical gear progression found in other games.
---
GW2 tries to replace this with cosmetics, but that's hugely undermined by the fact that better versions of everything exist in the cash shop. Why should I grind for a mediocre wintersday weapon when it's not the one I really want anyway (that one's in the cash shop)? So even if I don't buy the weapon skin from the cash shop, the fact that it even exists sort of invalidates all the content I would otherwise be doing to unlock the in-game earnable version.
---
Oh, should anet have not funded the game in any sustainable way after release? No cash shop, no subscription, free content for years, rare purchaseable expansions? Maybe they should have relied simply on donations to keep funding the game. 
---
No, it's a fact: MMOs need a sustainable and profitable source to continue funding the game. 
---
This isn't white knighting Anet, it's pointing out what you're too fucking blind to see.
---
Uhh i do, not my fault you're dumb even for your own stuff.
---
Rip. Didn't know that, it makes sense though.
---
you make a fair argument. Im still not sold on the idea, as ive seen things like that blockade that shouldnt be possible in eve online, but in fairness im not an expert either.
---
yeah i cant wait to grind for that set of weapons that look like bland level 22 leveling weapons
---
Do you need to study them to start?
---
&gt; Uhh i do...
---
So, why not answer the question?
---
As I said, I know you well and I know what to expect from you.
---
You did not disappoint.
---
Here's the thing:  A sub fee costs $12.99/mo for 12 months of sub.  So that's $155.88 excluding taxes a year.  This would be the minimum cost to play a game a year.  The way a sub is designed is to give you things to come back to and want to play and pay for access to.   This however, isn't all that great because if you, for whatever reason, can't pay your sub fee, you lose access to the game.
---
Yes, having a gemstore actually allows people who just want to buy in and play, to play, however, it incentivizes other, toxic business practices that are aimed at targeting whales and other big spenders.  This isn't really decent for your average consumer as, those micro-transactions aren't micro anymore. Look at the previous gemstore back at the start of the game.  There were items that cost double digits worth of gems and whole armor sets went for $10 instead of the piece-meal we get in the store now that costs substantially more for less.  (Gloves, boots, shoulders, and helmet).
---
Both methods have their problems, but honestly, I'd prefer a consistent game I pay for over predatory cash shop these days.  One is something I can plan around while the other just wants me to splurge 100s of dollars without thinking about it.
---
gem store skins objectively have more work put into them than in game rewards. theyre higher res and higher quality.
---
So, grind for that gemstore weapon that doesn't "look like bland level 22 leveling weapons".
---
You're grinding either way. So, why are you complaining?
---
Are the people that said that still working at Anet? When you change your headcount, you’d probably change priorities too...
---
A shapeshifted Norn
---
This is the problem going on in a lot of games now. Destiny is going through yet another period of unrest over the cash shop because, for the last few seasons, Bungie has added more items to the cash shop than to the loot pools, even in terms of the season-limited activities. I haven't played GW2 for several years, but I still follow this sub because I keep telling myself that I'm going to go back eventually. But it's a little disheartening to see that it's going as heavy on the cash shop as Destiny is.
---
You realize that just restating your argument without any evidence to support it doesn't actually make said argument any closer to true, right?
---
My "logic" has been about what is considered "earning". It's really not that complicated, but I'm glad you were able to make it so for yourself.
---
You deciding to waste more time going back and forth avoiding thinking for yourself is your decision. Don't include me in it, simply because I decided to entertain your responses.
---
You never had an argument for anything I've said...and you still don't have one (as with most people that are hurt over what I've argued), which is not surprising.
---
Morons think I'm a moron...and they are free to think so; but it won't suddenly make them correct - the same way instant downvoting someone whose response or argument you disagree with because it contradicts your own belief won't suddenly make you correct.
---
Your grind was to get it early. A newcomers grind is to get it faster, 2 years later. 
---
Just because my parents walked to school uphill, against the wind, while battling Kung Fu racoons every day, doesn't mean I have to. The world has moved on. Likely, right this moment you're working on another collection. You'll have it for years before I do, and my grind will be shorter by far.
---
You know what else negatively impacts the reward structure of the game itself? Shuttering the game because they have no income.
---

---
Brought this up in map chat a few days ago and got told that mount skins are available in game because you can get them from black lion chests.
---
Imagine having zero ability to present any kind of actual counter argument or point to defend your own point of view, yet spouting nonsensical garbage at a pitiful attempt to insult someone who is clearly of a higher intellect than yourself.
---
Have you figured out the pieces yet? Take all the time you need to come up with the list.
---
nobody ever said they were fast lol, just that "Anet will never do X" is a fools bet.
---
Nah, Almorra told us that the storm was gone. Who are we to doubt **DRAGON REAPER**?
---
I'm embarrassed for you for posting this.
---
Those are 2 different thigs. Simple party ui can be turned on in the options menu and makes the party ui more compact (like it is in pvp by default).
---
You are talking about the "view as grid" option for squads but you are right. Sadly you will only see your sub group while deactivating the squad grid. But it still looks cleaner when combined with the simple party ui.
---
PvP and WvW are still fun even though they rarely change, and the existing PvE maps are still fun to replay sometimes
---
Oh thank you, I didn't know that reddit existed!
---
Couldn't you just watch a short video on youtube the day before?
---
&gt; 700gems are like 2days in fractals.
---
You and I aren't doing the same fractals.
---
Iirc, it's a code you get if you buy the pop figure, right? It's not like this mini is going to show up and demand you buy something.
---
Are you 1v1 in sPvP or WvW? Different metas for 1v1 specs in both. As others have mentioned, there tends to be builds that counter one another.  The best builds for dueling tend to have either 1) High Burst and Decent Disengagement abilities (Mirages, Daredevils, Holos) or 2) High Mobility, Sustain and Pressure (Soulbeasts, Warriors).  
---
I would probably put the best overall dueling class as Soulbeast, since it has a lot of potentional in the hands of an expert. You can have incredible damage, powerful regen and sustain and strong defense with your stealth, blocks and ability to heckle your opponent at a distance and up close. It covers a lot of the bases.  Spellbreaker is also a powerful dueling spec with good damage mitigation and pressure. It's probably easier to learn than Soulbeast, but lower skill ceiling. 
---
If you want a high burst class to try and spike down your opponent, Mirage, Herald, and Daredevil are good options. If you're aiming for condi, Mirage and Necro are good options. I've struggled with Condi Scrappers recently too, actually and I don't usually struggle with condi builds.  
---
I main Ele and Weaver, if you know how to play, can easily survive a duel for quiet some time, but it can be hard to actually kill your opponent if you're traited into staying alive. Go too bursty and you can easily kill opponents, but god help you if they survive your burst you have crap defense. Dragonhunters are kinda similar, you  can last a while if you know what you're doing and take out players who aren't as aware, but if you're opponent has a brain you won't be killing them.  However if you're playing sPvP DH's can be deadly if you're trying to defend a point with their traps.
---
I'd also suggest taking a look over at metabattle and seeing what builds they list as meta. It's a good place to get an idea of what is currently being used in today's game.
---
Lik3ly those are placeholder dates
---
Unlike most pops, some of there actually look halfway decent.
---
Yeah, I kinea want to get the Aurene and maybe Rytlock.
---
If you're interested and didn't know then first game has own sub - r/guildwars
---
TL;DR: "We couldn't find enough writers, so we started a diversity hiring program."
---
more like 20 days
---
Excellent idea with the one way point. I was assuming most players would just move to the new side and the other half would quiet down. The method you describe would keep the entire map active in a great way.
---
The GW2 UI is really hard coded in a way that makes it difficult for ArenaNef to change any UI elements. It's apparently a lot of work whenever they do update it so I dunno if it's technically possible for them to make this change.
---
You can cherrypick examples like that all day, but on average, no, gemstore skins are not higher quality or resolution than ingame skins.
---
Real fun begins once things start to slow down. Imagine season 4 size map every 6 months.
---
Sure, if you do fractals on like 20 accounts.
---
This is what it takes to experience some of your content.
---
Expansions
---
I think his logic is "We have dungeon and raid armors and LS3 trinkets available as in-game rewards. Therefore, saying all rewards are gemstore only is false".
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
He's failing to understand that we've had pitifully few armor and weapon skins available as in-game rewards since launch. Things that used to be in-game quality rewards became gemstore rewards, and things that used to be gemstore-quality rewards became lootbox rewards.
---
Agreed. And there was already a cape available from the guild vendor.
---
It's crazy what people get excited about. I have literally hundreds of skins, dozens in each category, and many that look great.
---
And I've never bought any skin from the shop!
---
But I want more!
---
Oh, and I want it all super cheap! Lol.
---
Check out all the folks complaining about the cost of Winter's Presence. And that's got nothing to do with a cash shop.
---
That's really pretty. Where is that?
---
You got lucky
---
Yup, each time I got booted (black screen) without warning.
---
It’s not a graphics issue (I actually go offline to others), and it’s a weird connection bug that seems to be client-specific and not a connection problem (I multibox, and only 1 of 2 clients crash)
---
I'm getting some Globglogabgalab-vibes from your comment...
---
You have used two games *with* subscription fees as an attempted rebuttal.  If you are truly looking to refute my statement, you should list a buy-to-play, subscription free MMO that does not have a gemstore.
---
Elaborate, out of curiosity?
---
This is such a fantastic thing to see.
---
My game just freezes and a crash report pops up.
---
Haven't seen a thread on it yet. There's a hallucination of Almorra just south of the Gates of Svanir, that vanishes when you get close.
---
You may also find that you don't need that much gold if you are just starting out. This game spams loot at you if you play it.
---
As long as you can get into some season 3/4/icebrood saga maps you can get top tier accessories. That's enough, paired with some pretty cheap armor and weapons, to get you deep into what we in guild wars call "endgame."
---
it's not about being savvy. people, understanding the dynamic or not, will see the ludicrous exchange rate and purely based on that figure that they'd rather spend a few bucks than spend borderline insane amounts of gold they build up over a good amount of time.
---
Its cheaper to craft most any item in the game than it is to buy straight up.
---
since you are a person that love doing collection, then do the collection to get the precursor then craft then legendary.

Even if she reads this post and finds out that this is your account, she's still not sleeping with you.
---
&gt;How ArenaNet is rewriting the narrative for its narrative writers
---
By lowering their standards for hiring apparently.
---
&gt;"We kept either seeing the same people applying for the job who weren't necessarily aligning with what we needed, but also we were seeing a lack of diverse candidates.
---
&gt;"So what we wanted to do was to try and as a company, as a team, become more competitive by being able to serve a broader market than we were currently able to do. And we decided to look at the people who are applying who maybe had potential but weren't ready, and figuring out if there's anything we can do to help them bridge that gap."
---
Naturally, when they say "Not diverse enough," they obviously don't mean any sort of class diversity or wealth level growing up or anything like that, they mean racial diversity.
---
&gt;We've got women, we've got men, we've got gay people, got straight people, we've got people from different races and ethnicities.
---
God forbid class actually being represented in your roster.
---
That question is always just a patch away from having different answers.
---
Enjoy your Engi! They get the job done!
---
Necros and revenants have occasionally been unwelcome in some high end stuff. Thieves and memsers sometimes get pidgenholed into specific tanking roles in raids.
---
But my knowledge is a little old. I think that since you can eventually swap easily between elite specs, you'll be fine with any class.
---
If you've played other MMOs, then I'd say that bringing a warrior to a group is kind of like bringing a healer in other games. Not because they heal... But because they are always needed:)
---
Almost like the fact that they DO have a sub fee proves that the whole "it's a trade off, so it must be used as an excuse" is bullshit.
---
But of course a white knight wouldn't understand that.
---
More along the lines of "We couldn't find enough good writers, so we started a mentorship program to teach people with experience in writing for other types of media how to write for games. Also we try to go for more diversity because it offers different perspectives when it comes to writing the stories and characters we try to write."
---
I get why people tend to dislike "diversity hiring", but they definitely brought up a very valid reason in this article.
---
cool
---
The article is basically a a fluff piece tring to praise anet for lowering its hiring standards because its done in the name of diversity.
---
The problem is when those lower hiring standards are actually reflected in the lower quality story its kinda hard to not see through this as a fluff piece. You can't praise a company for its writer hiring practices (especially when those hiring practices are literally lowering the bar) when the stories the company is putting out are notoriously bad.

---
This guy upvoted EA's Star Wars comment.
---
Size isn't everything... I'd take most of the season 4 maps over the POF maps in quality of replayability.
---
I wish the new weapon sets had been more of an effort to obtain. I think Anet frequently misunderstands the value of a moderate size grind.
---
What?
---
Never thought to do that. Thank you!
---
Well close enough. Been year's since last played that.
---
For example, here's a babyman writing cliche babyman things. Like a strawman argument come to life. Amazing.
---
I see they've yet to update the npc dialogue options.
---
Must be because of all the new inexperienced writers they keep hiring.
---
Calls someone an NPC, only verifying they are indeed an incel.   
---
Pobrecito.
---
You can still have the same system with a "seamless" world. WoW already phases you sometimes between two zones where the players behind you disappear and if they follow you they reappear again. (I saw that often at entrance of Stormwind)
---
Also two connected zones don't have to share any informations. It might look weird in some cases but would it be much worse than the current system? And they could still add an improved system where you do see some data (other players) from another zone. The game would just do the same automatic "instance select" it already does (when joining a map) when near a connected zone. If that zone closes it would just select another.
---
It would obviously be quite a lot of work and I don't think the current engine would be suitable for that (the dense fog tries to limit your view distance already). But I also don't think "that feature" is the main reason they didn't do it. I mean you do know that most other games with instanced zones also have to shut down the servers completely? It's obviously easier with instanced maps but it surely isn't a requirement.
---
Yes, because not being an incel loser boy means that anyone defending diversity MUST want to bone the female in question.   
---
Your world must hurt to live in, being such a victim.
---
Hell, its one of the reasons I can take long, long breaks from GW2 and not really feel much other than faintly bad because I try to play stuff with my brother (we live in different states, now) when we're able and have the time.  Its fucking sad because I just...not even the daily login rewards are enough to tickle my fancy, except with specific days.
---
Compare that to Ultima Online, where even if I'm not *actively* playing, I still log in every couple of days because my house decays if I don't, and I worked my *ass* off for that house.  I didn't pay the UOGamers: Demise staff to plop down a house for me.  I didn't have to donate to get the decor I wanted or pay real, actual American dollars for the crates and shit I use to store my dragon's horde of materials and loot.  I worked like a bastard for all of it.  Trained up my characters, built up their stats and skills, even had some interplay between them because you can only max out so many skills and there were times I needed money for crafting supplies that only my dragon-hunting alchemist could bring in, in addition to all the fancy leather and dragon scales I could get my greedy hands on.  I invested a massive amount of time getting to where I am, and I got all of it for fucking *free*.
---
I play GW2 when I really wanna stove some heads in because the combat really, honestly, is the best I've played in any MMO.  Its fluid, dynamic, and relies more on player skill and know-how than just having to painstakingly micromanage your stats and build to oblivion like you have to in, say, D&amp;D Online.
---
BUT!  I could spend *days* in Ultima Online making my character better at punching trees or making kickass armour and weapons.  Hell, I've made characters whose sole purpose in life is becoming top-tier at *begging NPCs for money* and fishing.  It basically has no story but whatever one you decide to make up, and its insanely absorbing.
---
Of course, we could also debate the complete decay of the GW2 story into basically wondering when an Asura is going to grab some bullshit magitech from the asspull dimension to either fix the problem or give everyone in a kilometer radius some kind of whacky magical affliction that turns their toes green and makes everything taste like Marmite.
---
&gt; incel
---
Incel stands for (In)voluntary (Cel)ibate. So, do tell, how does this apply?
---
&gt; For fuck's sake, you people are a broken record.
---
Excellent and classy rebuttal.  However, it fails address how you think ANET would earn money without offering items on the gemstore.   
---
&gt; ok for them to focus solely on monetization
---
Who said that?   
---
They do supply armor skins and weapons outside the gemstore, but it's inconvenient to admit that up when you using disingenuous arguments while attacking strangers on the internet instead of actually engaging in an earnest dialog.
---
You must be really desperate for pussy if you're this dedicated to the white knight act. Almost as if you're involuntarily celibate and you think this is your only way out.
---
I think we can all assume with a high probability that no female would ever want to bone you. Thus, you are an Incel.   
---
And nothing you've done thus far has dissuaded me that I was incorrect in my assumption. You read like every single manbaby troll on every comment section online ever.   
---
Pobrecito!
---
&gt;Like a strawman argument come to life.
---
The fact that you fail to see the irony of this in your own comments is truly a testament to the power of cognitive dissonance.
---
Nice attempt  to flip it.   
---
C- for effort.   
---
D-  final grade  
---
No passing go or collecting the $200.
---
&gt;I think we can all assume with a high probability that no female would ever want to bone you.
---
Pretty presumptuous of you to assume you know how all women think.
---
I frequently wish they'd move the level cap/equipment rating to invalidate some of the existing content.
---
We in guild wars have traded that old one-uping for a different one... How do we get people off of SW? Make a slightly more rewarding SW...
---
Of course the community would go ape-sh** if that was actually done. But in an alternate universe, it works out really well:)
---
You're right! I totally forgot about your cousin.
---
From this and the rest of your replies to me, I can only assume you're underage, so I'll just stop replying to you.
---
I’m confused? Someone mind explaining why this is a bad question or why it’s bad to ask it?  People ask me sometimes and I happily say that I got it from gems. I’m confused why it would make you feel bad? I am proud of farming those things myself and especially for  GW2 where you make your own game I am happy that I was able to get it. It’s your gear, you earned it. Answer to those curious and just have fun, not sure how a simple question “feels bad”.
---
Pff
---
Spoken like a true casual, get on my level.
---
Happened with me too, I got out using the world boss portal device
---
I don't. . . wh. . . why is this?
---
Right on, just didn't want the guy to think he could knock this out in a day or two buying TP stuff, so far in my limited play I've spent over a week playing a few hours a day and I'm only now to the saddle step. Luckily I do LS4 trains so I'm not starting from a scratch, but still have a few days of farming left to complete.
---
Did Google go into administration?
---
Also the Amazon MMO used to be more like a sandbox survival game anway. A lot of things reminded me of games like ARK: Survival Evolved, Rust, etc. And there aren't really any titles of big companies for that type of game either.
---
Though it seems like they changed a lot of things now to make it more accessible like no forced PvP and offering more quests.
---
Sorry, they're unannounced. No one knows.
---
Wow there's some goal post moving "You don't need the cash shop for good items"
---
"ok well really you do need the cash shop, but just grind for it pussy"
---
Thanks!
---
thank you  :)
---
Lol, just not the specific items the poster asked about.
---
So basically there were intern UI designers (that gave us lfg), intern programmers (apparently literally everything), intern artists (mostly for gemshop) and now we also got intern writers, that are [insert minority here], because normal qualified people didn't want to apply to this company. It isn't like humanity run out of good writers, you know. 
---
Where is this game/company going, I don't know, what a dumpsterfire.
---
&gt;makes everything taste like Marmite
---
&gt;Thats why you stop playing it :D
---
Couldn't agree more!
---
IMO any map attached to an existing one... Lake Doric for example... Should be available to anyone willing and able to go to them. A lot of these places seem empty because only vets can access them on the regular and vets aren't going to revisit them without huge rewards or them being part of a daily.
---
This and improving the timing of the metas would go a long way to addressing some of the emptiness.

FAQ
---
What does this mean?
---
The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.
---
Why did you do this?
---
There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:
---
Rudeness towards other Redditors,
---
Spreading incorrect information,
---
Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.
---
Am I banned from the Reddit?
---
No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.
---
I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?
---
Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.
---
How can I prevent this from happening in the future?
---
Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.
---
Flap goes another flaccid one.
---
Visit dragonfall daily (park a toon there) and buy the daily "curious stones from afar".
---
I'm not sure if this is something rendered meaningless by the Bjora Marshes and the other new one.
---
BTW, If you eventually want the trinket, you'll need even more currency. Might want to start hoarding.
---
Downvote away butthurt boy. Some of us don't get life validation from Reddit karma.  ;)
---
Im super great full for the reply! Thanks for taking the time, would you care to add me in game if i have any other questions? I'm on phone atm, so i have to screenshot everything you say. So i can use your info later xD.
---
I really agree, and I can totally see how hard it would be to find new inspiration for weapons in video games. I think it's especially difficult for artists because weapons aren't just a cool skin anymore, but they are basically a whole audio visual experience. I want to say how exceptional the new legendary great sword is in how it addresses this, but it's quickly becoming the norm, give it 10 years and that'll be the starter weapon for x new mmo. Saying that, your work is really exceptional. I just hope to God that it's not released as a gemstore thing. That'd really kill the excitement for a new weapon release.
---
Mmmhmm!!!
---
In other words, you have jack squat to say back. It's ok, with all of that butthurt manbaby rage inside, you already have plenty to deal with ;)
---
Yeeeeee!!!!
---
After last update like fcking hell
---
I can't PvP raids.....
---
I think that this speaks to the need for a new model for procuring the old episodes...
---
The a la carte model is obsolete for things like season 2 and 3. I mean you get HoT for free (with PoF) but still have to pay for seasons 2 and 3? Maybe these should now also be a throw in? Or even just severely and permanently on sale...
---
Another one
---
In my several thousand hours over the past 7 years, I'm pretty sure I've had 3 keys drop from mobs. Never anything like a precursor, but I did get those keys.
---
But can you get a gold trim on it like in OG Wars?
---
Okay, you guys are interpreting this to be something far from intended. Anet has enough writers to begin with, and doesn’t need anymore. If people keep applying for the job and they need more writers, why not just hire them? Their funds would be best allocated elsewhere, and they don’t need anymore writers.
---
The industry has had an influx of aspiring “writers” who do not know exactly what the job entails. Many of them imagined being the ones spinning grand tales and deciding on the narrative direction of the game, on a much broader scale than they might get with the job. Narrative design for generally non-senior writers will be generally smaller scale. I imagine that their goal would be to educate the idea, first and foremost, what being a writer entails, followed by the skills and knowledge required for just that. 
---
Anet is not lowering their standards by any means, as this makes their confidence quite apparent. Their goal first and foremost is to educate aspiring writers, and hopefully allowing for a more diverse range of writers to take part in the industry to increase perspectives. If all goes well, this should have a positive outcome for more than just their own writers, but that of many other games as well.
---
lmao, no.  There's a healthy balance of monetization and less predatory tactics they could use to achieve this.  They just decide to put a multitude of skins into the gemstore just because whales are dumb enough or rich enough to splurge hundreds if not thousands of dollars a month on this garbage.
---
People who say stuff like that quote, are often very sad because they don’t anything but college all day everyday on their multiple books, only stopping to shitpost, maybe do dailies, and fractals. They often live with room mates or a SO who finances them.
---
To them, this is a reach for help and anybody who doesn’t acknowledge it, is a “kid.”
---
In a parallel universe, Anet made an RPG game, and it did all that you are asking for.
---
I keep mentioning this in the hopes that it gets through. The Jormag non-binary thing is NOT pandering, it's consistency. Zhaitan was "non-binary" in that it was almost always referred to as "it" or "the dragon". It's only when we got into HoT and we had this idiotic obsession with "humanizing" the dragons that Mordremoth and Kralkatorrik became big boy dragons. Obviously there are exceptions to this because the personal story is a rushed mess in many areas, but I think you get the point. The only reason you didn't see Zhaitan discussed as being non-binary is because that term wasn't in the public consciousness. These are Cosmic Horror villains, they don't have dicks or boobs anymore than they have a sense of fear.
---
&gt; Excellent and classy rebuttal. However, it fails address how you think ANET would earn money without offering items on the gemstore. 
---
A majority of the purchases are for keys, transmutations, and other cosmetic items.  In fact, I'm fairly certain they could get away with just those convenience items and be just fine.  However, ANet chooses to throw cosmetic item after cosmetic item into the gemstore *with* the convenience features too while leaving the new ingame rewards for every monthly event rather sparse by comparison.
---
For a 13 year veteran, maybe you should have done your research.
---
Like this guy did. In two separate, quite detailed posts.

Although I certainly think more should be added to ingame, the split I mean, it’s not as bad as people think it is.
---
Who is it pandering to? What makes it lazy? And most importantly, why does it even matter -- is it detrimental to the story, to the game as whole, to the playerbase?
---
I'm legitimately curious as to why this is something that anyone should "be annoyed" about.
---
Whilst I agree with the overall statement,  I don't think saying that you got it through fracs is obtuse. The fact that you can get pretty much anything in the store by simply playing the game, and in any way that you find enjoyable,  is great. I've farmed 90% of my mount skins this way and it's amazing.  As is the fact that Anet gave this option despite gemstore being its primary source of income. If we didn't have the option to convert gold to gems, now that would've been a shit show.
---
Did you ever get through? I'm having the same issue.
---
Oh good, I'm glad to see that the reason your really upset over this is because you're just extremely concerned about people of color and women and other minority groups finding dignity in their work.
---
Because you know, otherwise your comments would really come off as just racist and misogynist.
---
They do seem to be taking inspiration from Season 2.
---
Hopefully we'll see some things happening in other maps - like how Mordremoth's vines attached to waypoints in S2.
---
S2 had similar - in the first half, we had Mordremoth's vines going after waypoints for four weeks (from Ep1 to Ep3 launches). In the second half (Silverwastes), we had the Vinewrath's vines slowly going towards Camp Resolve until the final episode (over 9 weeks iirc).
---
Okay, so it's pandering to some person or group, but we're not really sure who, right? But we are sure it's definitely bad that those people are being pandered to. Got it.
---
And okay, it's definitely lazy because clearly it's a VERY important facet of Jormag's character -- some might say it's the dragon's defining characteristic, right? It's very, very important.
---
I too would guess that keys are probably the biggest seller.  I would guess (and guessing is all any of us can do) that outfits and skins far out sell tranmutation charges since those are so easily obtained in game.  
---
&gt; I'm fairly certain they could get away with just those convenience items and be just fine.
---
I wonder if NC Soft would agree, or if they expect ANET to try to maximize gemstore income instead of shooting for "just fine".
---
Yeah, and I feel like by the end of the episode that was clear.
---
Sneaky=bad...
---
But weren't the flame legion sought out? Maybe the renegades just had their feeling hurt? Lol
---
If the woman hating, human hating, cult and evil magic worshipping Flame Legion can be sorry and reform overnight, why can't the Renegades? Because their leader doesn't have a sweet daughter that we can feel sorry for?
---
I mostly just feel like this shift came about too quickly... Let me summarize:
---
New Big Good Guy recruits one group of former bad guys. Former bad guys now are good guys.
---
New Big Good Guy recruits another group of former bad guys. Those former bad guys are still bad guys because they didn't enjoy the concert.
---
New Big Good Guy recruited music hating bad guys? New Big Good Guy clearly actually Bad Guy!
---
But first former bad guys are still now good guys! Don't worry!
---
All it took was an hour of in game action!
---
Maybe this is inevitable with this kind of medium for storytelling. But I just feel like it could have been handled in  more stages.
---
Download some movies, run 10 youtube vid in the background. Render some video clips while playing the game. The game just became heavyweight.
---
Not really. Simply because episode one was so short.
---
There is a guide to everything. There are optimized guides for 500 crafting levels. Farming in this game is nonexistent. You just need to play the game. I don't even consider spending hours doing Silverwastes runs as "farming." You're really just legit playing the game as it is meant to. Just make sure to have a level 43 loot character to open up loot for mid tier materials which are more valuable. Invest in the silver matic salvager to make your life easier, its a BL item. Salvage everything, deposit everything, and then sell on TP when your encumbered with materials (its more satisfying this way). There is a gold sink to all of these legendaries. I suggest doing meta events from Heart of Thorns maps (especially Auric Basin) as many gen 2 legs require materials from those maps. And like I said, there is a guide for EVERYTHING in this game. Bookmark Event timers so that you know exactly when to visit a map for its meta event.
---
And to answer your question which has already been answered somewhere in the comments. Always buy the pres for Gen 1 legendaries. My advice above is for Gen 2 which I believe is more worth your time and effort because those legs have very good and timely collections. Especially Astralaria and Nevermore.
---
Turn screen shake back on

Normally there's a decent discount at Humble Bundle around this time of year, but it seems ArenaNet sat out this year.
---
in a way thank god, I lost a legendary on the template mix a lot and went around all my characters that could equip a sword to find it... my deadeye female norn had it hiding on a second template lol (aka was naked but wearing a legendary sword on top of a skritt ^~~porn~~ stash at ember bay)
---
yes english is not my first language. 
---
im trying to say
---
all you have to do 5-6 hours farm for it. We are able to buy easily. If everyone can buy it with 5-6 hours farm, how it can be p2w.  There is no pay wall, there is no huge grind for it. 
---
This is why he/she must be trolling.
---
Why is one (1) non-binary character existing pandering, exactly? It isn't even a human character, it's an eternal gargantuan being.
---
Play a norn.
---
Lol, this so much
---
Go to settings, there's an option to resize ui, toggle it on and off
---
Since it takes Anet half a decade + to fix anything, I'd say, probably won't be changed.
---
Yes, can't play at all since yesterday.

Theres an item that usually tps you there
---
sometimes I dont wear the stuff I bough in the store because I hate that question. And it doesnt at all feel as good as gear you actually worked for..
---
And don't forget Discord bots 😃
---
Imagine hiring people not based on their skill that they've been honing for years! Writing takes practice and developing one character is waaaay harder than it seems.
---
But sure, lets turn guild wars 2, a storydriven game into a even worse cringefest with bad characters and villans
---
 you’re asking for a different game
---
Hrm, that I have to pay monthly for FF14 doesn't bother me at all, really. I mean it's what I'm used to from MMOs, I started with EQ1 back in its early days. So for me GW2 is the outlier.
---
And in value it's unbeatable. I think over the 7 years I paid ~50-60€ in the cash shop, plus the box sales of course. For so much playtime that's incredibly. But it **does** show that the game has no stable income, both in the underlying design (as its meant to make you use the cash shop) and in the production quality.  
---
Which applies to all parts of the game. For example, FF14's original main game story is often lambasted for being bad, but honestly coming right off of GW2 I thought it was "okay"? It's not good, certainly, but it's average MMORPG fare with too much teleporting around but amazingly looking and sounding (FF14 has **the** sound advantage among any MMO I tried, it's phenomenal) setpieces every so often. And then comes the expansions, and the story just pulls leagues ahead of what GW2 does, more so when you then get to Shadowbringers, their newest expansion.
---
But of course it's also a question of available cash. If money is tight, then paying monthly for a MMORPG might just not be the right choice. Neither would be paying any money at all in GW2's cash shop, but seeing how they only put weird stuff in there and apparently never wanted my money it's still pretty easy to avoid and buy the few more necessary QoL upgrades with ingame gold. Granted.
---
"Yeah but that car doesn't count because you buy it from a store with currency earned from something else. It has to be unlocked directly from your task. It's not real if get it by using the currency from doing tasks that aren't related to the car that you want. You have to either craft that car yourself with materials you gathered yourself, or you have to be given that car AS payment for a task. Accruing currency as payment to then use to purchase the car makes it not a real car. It's not satisfying to unlock the car that way."
---
I believe you can also exchange Bjora Marches map currency for S4 currencies.
---
2 days???

&gt;I miss the days of getting your cape from your guild in GW1.

Why don't you get your cape from your guild in GW2...?
---
2017? Oh wow... This game is getting more and more ridiculous. I'm always excited when they say that they want to work on new Fractals and I'm always hoping to get something great like 99CM and 100CM. I never realized the original release of the best fractal is this far away. Welp, I doubt we'll ever see something good like this again.
---
Every map should have something like this that costs 1k of the map currency. Easy ways to boost rewards on maps and give more hardcore players something to work towards.
---
Two words - embigenning tonic.
---
Keys can drop in mobs? I've played since release and thought the only way to get them was doing the starter quest or buy in the store!
---
Fashion is in the eye of the beholder.
---
For example I don't like most skins in the gemstore
---
Oh wow are you posting this everywhere now, always missing the point of the discussion AND ignoring the fact that it is just not true what you're posting? And of course ignoring the difference in quality and type of item. 
---
Just wow. Whiteknights like you destroy the last bit of the game.
---
/r/Guildwars2/comments/ckqmvw/a_thorough_overview_of_ingame_rewards_from_hot/
---
Maybe the point is "hey let's make this character non-binary" because it's a fine reason since identity is not something that needs to have a specific reason to exist other than identifying a certain way?
---
Why you set it up for it to need to be something thought for a romantic relationship is weird but hey you do you I guess.
---
That has literally nothing to do with the discussion. What is not to your taste is the quality of the items they release in game and in the gem store and the types of items. 
---
Stating that you as an insividual don't like something changes absolutely nothing.
---
ANet told Delta to remove his templates, cos official solution will come out and it will be payed. Nobody would buy official templates if we had it from arcdps.
---
Can you please give a link to where ANet tells "don't have a problem with it at all" after official templates release?
---
Stop with the 7 years nonsense. This is an MMO. People need assurance that this game has a future and is actively being developed if you want them to invest time into it. With pretty muchevery area of the game being one step away from maintenance mode and all cool rewards ending up in the store (which MMO players hate), it's not looking good. 
---
They can't even promtoe the excellent combat they have because no content is being developed that'd utilize it properly.
---
Yeah they are better because you can clearly see that they had much more time to develop them with better textures, they add good animations and effects and overall they look more "superior". 
---
Just because you don't like them and you're more into a classic appearance, it doesn't mean that for you these things magically don't exist. 
---
I like the classic, more realistic appearance better too, but the gem store outfits have a vastly different quality overall and I can't just ignore that because I have a different taste. 
---
Wtf?
---
Wrong see WOW as example
---
Sorry but how are banners a crucial part...it is so rare that a raid wipes because of too low dps. 
---
Fuck we cleared several raid bosses using 6 healers (rev, scrapper, druid, firebrand, scourge, temp) just for shits and giggles. The only one I could think of might getting remotly close with bad dps is gorse everything else is barely a dps race. Even largos has plenty to spare and there banners were always not used anyway.
---
I'm in for more classic appearance? My main use Astralaria+ Eureka
---
I started gaming with a 4:3 screen, yes. But back at that time my PC had 99mHz and I was playing AoE with like 2 fps constantly. So yeah, that 4:3 is my standard which I hope to never see again.
---
yeah is annoying to get content every patch. I think they should start to removing old maps, no one play on them anyway. Lets just leave LA so we can show our 2000 gem mount there and fap in a bir circle. You are absolutely stupid my friend.every thing you say is so wrong I dont even want to go into details.
---

simple party ui sadly doesnt show the important stuff either, like food or portals

OP should have posted this as a link...
---
Rewards are part of the fun, especially in an MMO where character progression is so key.
---
I'm definitely not saying new content is a bad thing.  Every MMO gets new maps and content constantly, so its not like its abnormal.
---
Just sometimes, not every time, I think it could of been a better application to do it differently.  Granted they have to buff up their content in other areas if their maps are going to be smaller or stay on the same map for longer periods of time.
---
But you're missing the point. Buying microtransactions does not feel rewarding. Buying microtransactions does not incentivise playing content.
---
videos like these lures kid to play this style. myself included. yeez it look so fun to play it, but cancer to play against. you can't do anything vs this
---
I forgot that mastery even existed
---
Same, last time I played for more than an hour was probably somewhere last year or something. Hardly even booted up the game this year.
---
Hello I recently bought my new setup with a rtx 2080 super and wanted recently to reinstall and play again GW2 and I have somes questions...
---
I'm playing at 2560x1440 and I'm near 40 fps where there is the christmas event for example, wich is kinda annoying, i'm not a 144hz boy but I want ztleast to be nearby 60 fps...
---
And there is many thing wich is unobtainable in game and will never turn back again ? Ok i'm not against that totally but I don't like that much play a game where there is many thing unobtainable since I really like collections, etc... I know there is many event achievement unobtainable and yearly achievement too but i'm asking more about items, minions, etc
---
Thanks ^_^
---
Still have some of these:
---
Many ppl do stuff like this, but LH do it with style :). I rather watch this then Fake Walk wintrade pvp.
---
reminds me of that time when every time my necro exited the death shroud, it would leave a copy of her in the place she was when exiting.
---
I too mainly play fractals and raids. And recently I was feeling bored so I started to tackle vision and the associated achievements.
---
I also try to do as much WvW as possible, if I'm not doing fracs/raids then I'll do WvW/achievements.
---
I can't really advice you on a open world activity to get gold or fun, cause I hate them all and find them super boring.
---
Yea I did vision, skyscale, aurora collection and it was super fun but that's ended now. I started trying wvw for fun yesterday, wasn't feeling it really. Maybe I should give it some time
---
Make sure you are using a proper build for whatever type of fight size you are on.
---
If you are on a zerg use a zerg build, if you are roaming solo or in very small groups, use a roaming build.
---
Also WvW tends to be more fun and active on the weekends, near the end of the week it's not as populated, also highly depends on what server you are on.
---
If you haven't done the warclaw, it's a good activity to do while you figure out if you like WvW or not
---
I think I'll enjoy roaming more then zerging. Any tips or suggested build to go for?
---
Ive got then from one of those randam shamans at the start from volcanoe fractal, while he was running away. My teammate spammend ??? Because he got one too
---
I personally play revenant, but there is a variety of solid roaming builds. Check meta battle and WvW roaming builds and see what you like and identify more with.
---
Spellbreaker and Weaver are very strong sidenoders
---
I get what you're saying. BUt did you tell them there is also a guild version? That is not part of the store and instead needs to be earned by participating in guild activities with other players? Which even lets you customize its symbol?
---
\- Praises underwater combat
---
\- u/SwimmingResearch4
---
Name checks out :D
---
Also, welcome to the game! Hope you have a great time and enjoy the festivity thats going on right now! ;)
---
But cashshop Armor and Sets are superlow prestige and do not even look that good.
---
If you're a veteran you want to flex at other veterans. To be honest noobs get impressed by a little bling and some shinyness but at that point you don't care about bewitching casuals or new players.
---
You need to upgrade your fashonwars. 
---
Thats where those obnoxious Infusions start to matter as well als Legendarys in every slot or something similar.
---
I guess people are mixing game modes here:
---
\- Tower defense: Protect the Dolyaks from rampaging toys (my fav) -&gt; Can't afk here like ppl explained
---
\- Dungeon Instance: No Dolyaks, first objective is to bring gifts to the doll -&gt; No automatic progression, afk'ing possible. Was there too for the  [**Wintersday Wrecking Ball**](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Wondrous_Workshop_of_Toymaker_Tixx) achv, had no problems to get ppl through LFG (EU here)
---
And anet is working on a soluiton on this.
---
Content gets you gold which you can convert to gems
---
There are not a lot of problems with legendary armor if you only use it on only one character, yes. Because then you only need more^TM ~~templates~~ loadouts.
---
But there still are a lot of problems with legendary gear you switch between characters, hell even if you just want to switch legendary weapons within a loadout on a single character, you'll get massive problems with it ejecting every upgrade from it (reapplying legendary runes and sigil is NO fun).
---
Try out reshade. You can customize your visuals
---
I didn't realize that that was a secret.
---
Its absolute trash right now and it should have been there from the beginning. The people who thought this is a good way to implement templates clearly dont play the game at all
---
They will just make the SAB weapons dyeable and get done with it.
---
The fact that you can buy gems with gold makes this even worse for me because it now gives gold an actual price tag. I believe the last time I checked 110g was 300 gems, which is roughly $3.00, and I believe the fastest gold grind in the game atm is 50g an hour. So that likes getting paid $1.50 an hour... You're basically a slave.
---
Currently on my guardian I have a seperate template for fractals which uses twilight. All the other dgh/guard loadouts use a transmuted zojja's claymore. This is purely for the reason that if I want to stealth I need to reapply my sigils and infusions again which is retarded. The point of legendaries is that you dont need ascended versions of that weapon but rn its the exact opposite...
---
It's possible that a skill/tonic/novelty, combination of these or dismount action placed greatsword away from the avatar
---
Also, it seems that the event that was happening here in the field isn't working anymore - the one where [you had to catch rabbits eating watermelons](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shoo_rabbits_back_into_their_pen)
---
And for you again: 
---
- Time spent developing 
---
- The fact that they have heavily visible animations and effects that, in terms of professional view, are good and well thought 
---
- The view of the majority that the items are superior 
---
- The quality of the textures and details 
---
- The fact that there are categories that aren't even comparable because there is no ingame counterpart 
---
All these things are there, not negotiable and not changed or magically disappeared by "your taste" and make gem store items just better overall. 
---
A link to Quora that describes that fashion is subjective doesn't change the way you compare things. You compare things without any influence of personal opinion to avoid the Bullshit you're trying to pull off.
---
Farming gold to buy microtransactions is nowhere near rewarding as actually earning something tied to specific content, and it doesn't incentivise anything except playing the best gold farm. Try again.
---
nope - dont works
---
just installed to new
---
I find it better then arcdps, it espacilly feels more natrual then Arc and more part of the game. But okay i know ur kind well, i can nothing say postiv over the game anymore without that anyone is calling me Withe Knight. Gw2 is still own of the best MMORPG and will surive some years. And it is still what make it special to me, its unquie, in all aspects
---
Here's my hot take:
---
Having fashion be one of the only clear endgame achievements of your game means that cash shop skins are P2W.
---
The sad reality is that there are dozens of gemstore skins for every slot now that look as good or better than legendary weapons/armor, which should be some of the most elite looking skins in game.
---
What's the point in grinding for hundreds of hours if you can drop a $20 on a weapon that looks just as cool? I used to be a big believer in the way this game is monetized, but now I truly believe that it would have been better if the cash shop was gutted and we just had a sub fee. Too late now I suppose.
---
I like the game, its why im still playing it every day, but I wont say something is good when it clearly is not. It does what it needs to do for the more casual part of the game and that is fine, but honestly they never needed it really and yet the people that actually needed it get shit on and left in the dust which is kinda sad
---
I’m not sure I follow what you mean.  The idea is that the only time they really shake up the economy any is when expansions come out.  New materials and items really help keep things interesting.  The same rewards over several years (like in WvW) hurt the economy and the players because it saturates it with an endless supply.
---
Sounds like gambling with extra steps.
---
It's a big reason I stopped playing. Vanilla GW let me work toward cool armour sets that I loved. Here, there have barely been any new ones, the new ones they did release are boring ad, and if I want anything genuinely cool looking I have to buy it, rather than play the actual game.
---
Yeah the casual part are the big part, sry but anet can not only desgin the game for ur kind when they want to surive as a company.
---
Do check the gw2efficiency website as it shows which is actually cheaper. Iirc its just a handful like dusk, etc.
---
But if you like to do collections and not really care about the gold then go ahead and craft one.
---
They dont have to design the entire game for our kind, but taking the one feature that we actually need and the botching it for us is like spitting in our faces. On top of that they could have just held off the release until they were actually templates and that way they would worked for both casuals and the hardcore part but I guess thats too much effort :^)
---
They never spitt u in the face, what changed for u? This addon was never the way for anet to go, when it was why did they not take it. Yeah u are not fine with the way it turns out but it is not ur game, it anet game they have to decide what they male with there game. U are free to go or to stay but saying that anet did spit u in the face is simply wrong.
---
A cosmetic shop doesn't work in a game where the end game IS COSMETICS. You buy a cool outfit and weapon skin... Great. Now what? You're done the game.
---
There is no rewarding goals set for the players in GW2 because there is no real point in doing anything. A core feature in MMOs is giving obtainable goals to players to achieve. Usually by giving them stronger and stronger gear to work towards, in order to tackle greater threats. GW2 essentially took that away and replaced it with nothing.
---
If the End Game is cosmetics and all the good ones are in the shop, then it's just P2W garbage?
---
I may have a warped opinion on casual in this game. By casual I mean people that dont precast stuff during raids after blasting stealth and stuff like that and for those people it sucks pretty bad. Having different opinions is normal but I strongly disagree when you say its not a big fuck you to the hardcore part
---
AFAIK the trim can be dyed on all 3 of them, so yes but it isn't anything special lol
---
I think they care about the economy but don’t have anyone dedicated to watching it anymore.  Even this week we saw an adjustment to Wintersday presents on the hard path of the jumping puzzle.  I think the problem is that we play the game far more than they do and can see certain aspects failing.  They definitely need to look into hiring an economist to help the rewards team out, even if that person is working part time or comes in a few times a year to help explain or fix things.
---
You can in theory practice on world bosses but due to how fast fight are, you may not have time to test out stuff; there are of course large bosses like Shatterer, Claws and Tequatl, not mention Triple Trouble. The other option I'd say, would to participate in bounties whenever these appear in Elona maps. 
---
The other choice would be just rolling a new character and starting map discovery and push personal story forward; see [this nifty chart](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Template:Personal_story_chart) to see which scenarios you haven't seen yet (make sure you add necessary access during key creation to *characters* and *progression*). 
---
You can also just participate in events on maps - the Silverwastes would be a good testing ground, so the HoT expansion metas.
---
If you want something more relaxing then try materials farming in the open world - try to map out own route with [help of this site](http://starbuckguild.com/ore/); you can get thief or scrapper for stealth - it's quite useful if nodes are surrounded by enemies.
---
WvW is also an option but your experience may and will depend on home server and one it's paired with; sadly, EotM karma trains are the past but IMO that was a good introduction ground for this game mode
---
Ah u calling me a casual now, wow rly some one who reaced top250 in pvp, have some of the Raid achivment and full legy armor and some other pices in 3 Years is a casual?
---
But why would they do that when they can put it in the gem store ;c
---
I've had some weird crashes I couldn't even pinpoint exactly - usually after I waypointed and the textures were loading in for where I went to. Also had the game client prompt a repair of the .dat, which crashed and then the client loaded fine again.
---
Plus skill lag, even though my ping looks ok (&lt;150).
---
Grats.
---
This, put in on max, and set Horizontal Position all the way to the left for some Mass effect vibe ;) works for me
---
&gt;  they definitely focus way more on gem store cosmetics than content for the game
---
Fuck no. It's just infinitely easier to make model+texture+sfx than something you could call "content". It can, and usually is done by freelancers too.
---
I kinda hate to have my view obstructed in wvw, makes me think a thief is hiding behind
---
They have such a huuuge team, I think they just need to allocate the resources correctly. Also, it would help to actually listen to the part of the community that cares about the well being of the game. 
---
But that won't happen.
---
killing afk people, what a gem
---
Thootless Skin incoming omg.
---
I quit the game after playing the endgame (fractals, raids, legy crafting (got them all), TP) for 3 years.
---
Just became too repetitive and boring at some point
---
Got all of those, cant wear them because most of the time they are an eye sore (looking at you ad infinitum and infusions)
---
I fix that problem by only doing PVE lol
---
Lmao. The game has been on this route since day 1. Stop acting like its a recent trend.
---
There's something like a 250 year gap between the two. So no, you can't port your character across. But you can earn some rewards for GW2 in GW1.
---
Decrease mouse sensitivity lol
---
&gt; "Well they have to make money somehow! Just be glad you're getting anything!"

Man, wasn't it great back when developers made money by making games? Which we would then buy? And then we'd play it, and that was the end of the transaction? -_-
---
They made 5 WvW maps in total, 2 (EotM and Desert Bl) after the release, and no new maps ever since HoT. I would definitely not bring WvW maps as any argument.

---
Fashion from a consumers point of view is subjective as individuals at the end choose things they like so there too it's thier personal feelings.
---
Whereas id like to add that fashion is less subjective than style, style at the end is more subjective because it completely depends on feelings of an individual.
---
Hype!
---
Their resource allocation is definitely pretty bad.  Management for the company really needs to up their game.  A lot of missed opportunities with this game along with some questionable decisions.
---
The best combo of classes if you're new to the game is to play whatever you find the most interesting and fun. I know it sounds cheesy but it's true. Leveling alts in GW2 is very easy if you want to do end game content later on.
---
It does not matter if the offered is real. It just needs to be perceived as real.
---
Parts that stood out to me:
---
&gt; The final thing we anticipated but never saw in 2019 was Icebrood Saga’s “expansion-level” features. When I think of the features that Guild Wars 2’s two expansions gave us, I think of hours of epic story, elite specializations, a new class, raids, fractals, and legendaries. I think of masteries like gliding and mounts that changed the way I play the game, not just in the expansion zones, but all over the world.
---
&gt; Thus far in the Icebrood Saga, we’ve gotten a couple of weak drips of story and a set of masteries that have no usefulness outside of the map they were designed for. To be honest, they aren’t even that useful on the map they were designed for. Are any of the above features coming in 2020? I can only hope so, but until ArenaNet announces them, its players are going to assume they aren’t.
---
&gt; ArenaNet upping its communication game in the coming year certainly wouldn’t hurt either. Far too often fans are left to wonder where the game is going or what’s coming next and when. Players rarely give studios the benefit of the doubt when left with ambiguity, and naysayers have been claiming that this game is going into maintenance mode all year. I’d love to see ArenaNet put out a substantial 2020 roadmap in the early weeks of the new year. Even if it’s rough and vague, at least let us know that you’re still planning on doing something with the game in the long term.
---
I just did these a few weeks ago. My method to get them was to daily:
---
* Buy volatile tools for each of my chars and get magic while harvesting
---
* Go to Dragonfall and buy 5 of each currency using volatile magic
---
* Hit each renown heart and buy the packs of map currency with each character
---
* Run through Bjora Marches farming Ice on each character and buy them in the Keep
---
* On Weekends, farm the actual map
---
GW2Taco and Tekkit Map Markers really helped on the farming. Some of the heart events were long and irritating. Farming tasteless roots and killing the branded spies while NPC kept yammering about needed help every time you walked past makes me never want to go near the Allied Base Camp again. Though, tossing branded crystals at a target for 30 seconds is wonderful.
---
I kept a running spreadsheet to be able to track my burndown rate so that I didn't feel like nothing was happening each day. It also helped me balance which packs to buy with Ice Shards.
---
I mostly just bought the handful of Crystals and dragon food I still needed when I hit the 250 for each map currency. Doing the Silverwastes RIBA was a better path for me than the daily cycle.
---
maybe he meant 48h with 2 days 🤔
---
A long time ago I wanted to see how much it would cost to buy materials for the original legendary weapon, Meteorlogicus, and at the time it was about $210 USD. I haven’t played for years but it seems like a lot of stuff can be purchased like that.
---
Wow, now you obviously can't even remember the original point and make a huge ass curve around the last answer. Great, dude. Go, grab some sleep and keep trolling tomorrow somewhere else. You're more than lost.
---
I dont troll
---
25% from map completion
---
Yes, understanding that you eventually moved from "being content with occasionally playing simple stuff as a form of easy relaxation" to "largely apathetic and regularly questioning whether your daily time investment could've been better spent elsewhere" doesn't feel good.
---
&gt; Anet is not lowering their standards by any means, as this makes their confidence quite apparent. Their goal first and foremost is to educate aspiring writers, and hopefully allowing for a more diverse range of writers to take part in the industry to increase perspectives. If all goes well, this should have a positive outcome for more than just their own writers, but that of many other games as well.
---
GW2's story quality has visibly been in constant downards spiral since path of fire though, would be kinda hard to deny that. So it really doesn't seem to be working out very well for gw2. 
---
&gt; Their goal first and foremost is to educate aspiring writers, and hopefully allowing for a more diverse range of writers to take part in the industry to increase perspectives. If all goes well, this should have a positive outcome for more 
---
But they aren't hiring more diverse writers nor are they increasing perspectives.
---
To copypaste my other comment on faux """"diversity"""":
---
&gt;An upper middle class white college graduate writing for TV and an upper middle class black college graduate writing for TV have the same life experience.
---
&gt;Skin colour/sexuality/whatever doesn't give you a different life experience. Wealth level and class does.
---
&gt;A black millionare and a white millionare have more in common with themselves than they do with a black homeless person and a white homeless person respectively.
---
Turning the company into a racial menagerie isn't going to give their stories more variety because that's not where life experience comes from.
---
 Hiring 1 person who grew up homeless or impoverished regardless of race or whatever is going to add ten times the storytelling variety instead of "aspiring upper middle class college graduate writing for TV #12785713" if that's what they were actually aiming for.

---
I used arc templates fyi
---
You might not be. Some people only do T4s and recs, some people do CMs, some people do CMs, T4s, recs and then still do more.
---
However, if you average out at 30g daily from fractals and other daily tasks, actually selling the mats and fractal items, then it should take you just over 11 days at the current gem prices. So let's assume 4-5 days for users who really have the the grind optimized.
---
2 days seems a little far fetched, but it's not impossible if u/bluescreen2315 is actually spending pretty much the whole day in fractals and greatly exceeding the dailies.
---
Thats not a common use case for what this was intendet and anet said they will extend the feature
---
Cool, so I just need a time machine 😁
---
There is now in the game 1148 gemstore armor&amp;weapon&amp;backpack&amp;outfit&amp;dyes&amp;mailcarrier&amp;mount&amp;finnisher&amp;glider&amp;novelty skins of total 7693 skins (total), 1148skins= 14,92%. 85,08% is from ingame
---
&gt;My hope for this game is at 0.
---
Exactly it all looks like the devs or whoever is in charge lost faith in the game and they are slowly phasing out content drops and support.
---
Mainly that but it was also a leveling train too. When they added reward tracks to WvW but didn't include Edge it became a ghost town. Nobody does it because it doesn't have reward tracks. And lets be honest, the game isn't getting new players.
---
Waiting it out is something you should not do. Because as i said, as soon as the dollies start to die the instance is dead and i imagine that noone will be ported in too it and people who would join would instantly leave for a new instance.
---
I have no answer to why it is not working for and have not run in to the problem my self and done many. Can only tell you to join a new instance and keep on trying until you get one with people.
---
I understand your point and agree.
---
My point is that you can quite readily ignore the store and have all sorts of great rewards. The problem is all in your head. Content does have good incentives. It's just not identical to the Black Lion ones.
---
I have Nevermore.
---
Knowing that there is a way that someone could have procured a totally different skin by using a credit card doesn't make me like Nevermore less. It is still awesome!
---
It was a typo. He meant 20.
---
I am not defined by my gender and/or sexuality. Are you?
---
They only play a big role in my life when I am in a relationship, or seeking to be in one.
---
I don't see that including Jormag's gender tells us anything about Jormag. That's why it seems like a silly detail.
---
People only really used EoTM for farming, or for messing with farmers. It was a completely braindead activity, as you only needed the intellect to follow the others and make shiny effects when others do.
---
Also speaking of honesty, when was the last time you set foot in low level areas?
---
I feel like the argument he made could be made without bringing game-time into the equation.
---
I.E. A complete and proper look through skins earned in-game is more prestige than purchased skins, regardless of how long you play.
---
There are plenty of Veterans who are content with looks from the gem store.
---
The wrapped presents thing is daily, btw. Generally people give gifts to the orphans every day while drowning in karma boosters to get a really good karma gain.
---
The challenge I seek requires a fair amount of dedication from me as well which is something I am not willing to put into the game(or raids specifically) because they are not enjoyable to me.
---
I am confident they are hard, but not rewarding enough to be worth it.
---
Nothing GW2 gives me in the raid, is going to even come close to completing "Herald of the Titans" and get the title or completing Raider of the Ulduar Raider and getting and AMAZING mount, for those familiar with 2008-2009 World of Warcraft raiding.
---
They truly need to put out worthwhile, far-reaching content to turn this ship around. New Elite Specializations would go very far in refreshing older content, but in making newer content *feel* newer instead of rehashed. New takes on existing classes offers more depth to what we have not only at an individual level, but in terms of synergy for Fractals and Raids, and matchups in WvW and PvP. Of course, working on balancing already existing class matchups remains an ever-present issue, but if made intelligently new Elite Specializations could help with that balancing curve.
---
They also need to look at these Masteries and give them a use outside the map they're intended for. Especially upon seeing all that Raven amounted to (unlocking Gates and simply handed to the player via story, and Raven barriers for the storm meta), there isn't hopes for expansion-level Masteries there. Living Story Season 3 did more for "expansion-level Masteries" and it was set between our only two expansions. These Masteries feel like small roadblocks in progress and the player is simply handed the key at the right moment.
---
They don't feel impactful to the environment because you cannot progress without them/they aren't made to shortcut or "traverse the environment better than without." Masteries like Bouncing Mushrooms, Ley-line Gliding, Thermal Vents, and each Mount have added a feeling of movement progression, and often were not 100% needed to get around, though they made getting around easier and faster with each unlock. Masteries like Nuhoch Alchemy and Crystal Champion have made combat and encounters feel smoother or less of a struggle than before. That's what these Spirits of the Wild Mastery lines *need* to feel good and impactful: a feeling of upward progression and accomplishment/empowerment. But so far, they just feel like broken bridges for the sake of story progression.
---
Finally, it's time to make older content worth replaying in and of itself. Rewards for time investment seemingly keep dropping steadily. Dragon's Stand and Auric Basin were always filled (or so it seemed) a year ago. Now, it seems like they're only run by dedicated guilds. With events like Choya Piñata running directly opposite, faster, yet offering much the same rewards, it's clear why this is. Longer metas need prizes worth that time investment or they're all but abandoned for simpler and faster metas. And old content has never been Anet's strong suit, but that needs to change. Old content cannot simply remain abandoned to collect dust or we will only ever gain more and more "new and shiny maps 😍" that eventually and inevitably suffer the same fate.
---
Fear is what drives of what was supposed to be an awesome game into a "semi-average" game. GW2 set a great record in terms of combat, questing, loot, WvW, etc. But why IMO feel the game is stale? I'm not here to compare GW2 or other games say Runescape as a whole but to this day I am playing OSRS. Do you know why ArenaNet? I enjoy the engaging leveling systems, quest, boss fight, loot, farming, skills, etc. It is actually quite difficult to get a skill to level 99 in Runescape and when you do get it, it is satisfying. Not only satisfying but you also get a cape for that 99 skill with combat bonus! Guild Wars 2, you can get to level 500 on crafting in matter of minutes. What do you get at the end that is different from Runescape? NOTHING! That's one aspect why the game is stale. Arena Net needs to hire college graduates to get them fresh ideas lol.
---
efficiency needs to implement it first, but presumably yes, soon.
---
Thank you for this write up. This has been very helpful.
---
Guild Wars 2....it is time for bed it's 7PM. Have a bright early day tomorrow. The bus will pick you up at 7:30AM. Your new school is Guild Wars 3. Make some new friends k?
---
The ending of S4 and the Charr concerns in S5 are a pretty good step in the right direction. Really; the world was behind the Commander when he had a Dragon and they were fighting the Big Bad. But now that the Big Bad is gone, everyone is worried about what the Commander is going to do with "his/her Elder Dragon". They no longer see the Commander as this wandering hero but as a potential threat and someone to be watched. There's the potential for that paranoia to spiral out into a decent storyline--especially if Jormag becomes an ally. 
---
But that depends on ANet's treatment of the narrative.
---
I have the right answer for you. Pour coffee on your computer. Then pay for a brand new computer. Then you'll experience Guild Wars 2 as an expensive/heavy game.
---
What's the best way to farm WxW experience nowadays?
---
Haven't logged in a while, what is the state of WvW?

But can't you explain that this game is sustained on the cosmetics? There is no sub fee, putting stuff on gemstore is the only thing that will let this game survive. That's how it works, and if someone would ask me a question: why is it on the gemstore, not in game like in WoW?
---
I'd answer: that's how you can support this game, if you wish to, cosmetics don't make the game, there are no p2w items in there, you enjoy something nice, buy it, by buying it, you support GW2.
---
I've gone back to old games, with some new in between, but no MMO's so far. Legendaries really don't mean anything anymore these days considering how easy it is to get gold.
---
I wont be playing gw 2 in 2020
---
$50 or free, it doesn't change the fact that build templates is something that would generally be released alongside an expansion. That makes it an expansion level feature. As for the other things, did you seriously expect them to release an entire expansion worth of content and features in a single episode?! We've got 1 episode and a prologue so far. There's still an entire season ahead of us for crying out loud. While I'm personally not holding my breath, you're literally having a massive overreaction.
---
agreed, just like the wallet, shared inventory, wardrobe, and the novelty tab... oh wait...
---
Here, too; went from Headstart, thousands of hours, and all the trimmings to... did part of 'Prolog', skipped Mad King, logged in long enough to unlock ep. 1, will skip Wintersday... 
---
I play XIV now; yeah, it's $15/mo (which is less than I spent on Gems), but there's a defined roadmap, a decent flow of content, I can get mounts, minis, music, and glam from *actually completing content* instead of the Cash Shop (while the CS contains those things, for the most part they're from limited-time content that happened years ago), and the communication is excellent and regular. 
---
Sure, PvP is a hot mess, it's a 'traditional' MMO (gear grind, but toned down, etc.), you're railroaded into completing the storyline to advance (unless you buy a skip), the first part of the storyline is sloooooow (as is the combat, but my old reflexes appreciate it), but I can always find something to do, as the 'job system' means I don't need a bunch of alts to do different things; if I want to try a Tank class, I just switch my job to Marauder or Gladiator, and start thwacking.
---
Sorry bud, the chances of there being a GW3 are pretty slim.
---
I mean if someone has all legendaries, they probably have the contracts too and since it was quite a while since the last legendary, they saved up a lot of gold again 
---
There is not that much to spend it on
---
What about using the dynamic UI option to shut off map while in combat?
---
Personally, I like the idea of weapon sets that *accompany* legendary weapons without explicitly being legendary. They aren't the same, but you could definitely equip them alongside Pharus and they'd look awesome. The bioluminescent set also had a similar thing going but with Nevermore instead of Pharus.
---
I'd really like some other legendary weapons get this treatment, particularly HOPE and The Predator. Awesome work!!! :D
---
Thanks
---
If they added PIPs to the EoTM map people would return in droves. For many in the game now it would look like new content because they have never seen a populated map.
---
Game has no future if the veterans seem more content with bashing it in public 24/7 (ie. This sub). No one is going to start a game with this many toxic people bitching all day long and the company refusing to properly market/highlight the game's strength. No more people = no more money = game actually dies rather than just pretend dying for 5 yrs as this sub would have people believe.
---
For new players, this game needs no new content. There is enough to keep them busy for a long long time. For the rest of us, if we get these new people (if this sub shuts the fuck up for a while and Anet properly markets their game), maybe we get what we need too.
---

---
2019 was the deciding year for GW2, most of those players aren't coming back.
---
No I didn't complain when they introduced another male entity in a universe full of male entities. Or when they introduced another female character in a world full of female characters.
---
Maybe I should have, since the gender of such an alien entity doesn't seem like it fits on the human spectrum.
---
But I assumed, in part, that these were being introduced to facilitate the use of pronouns for ease. If we had been given Jormag's personal pronouns then maybe this would have given us something to use. As it is, I feel uncomfortable using any pronoun.
---
Pro tip for the real world: most non binary individuals don't go by "it." Since we now have that designation for Jormag, we should get Jormag's pronoun.
---
Well, except for Eureka lol.
---
5 hours straight doing same JP will ruin you mental sanity like some Eldrich horror. But ye 15 gold is not that much
---
Mike Z didn't get the position that Mike O had. He's not in charge. NCSoft is. Not the best outlook...
---
This year was definitely the roughest for me.  The glimmering hope that the WvW restructure update would happen was enough to keep me hanging on though.  Then my guild and all but one or two friends quit and I'm left here wondering why I bother logging in anymore.  I quit playing for a few months but came back about a week or two ago because I just couldn't find anything else enjoyable to play.  Halo coming out again and the 1000th Call of Duty isn't even the slightest bit interesting to me.
---
I think one of the biggest problems that a lot of us have with GW2 is that there are SO many things done right that it ruins playing other games for us.  Then we see Anet making weird decisions or poor choices and we start to get frustrated and lose hope that it's going to continue to be our favorite game or that it will get better.  I almost feel stupid for having hope left.
---
I'm not white knighting anything.  You're just complaining about something that's already been addressed acting like if you keep it up that it will happen sooner.
---
These factors make it hard to get back into it especially since I started others like bdo
---
&gt;Well...
---
Well nothing. You *knew* an expac wasn't coming. Y'all got no one to blame but yourselves on that.
---
Well definitely not later ... and it’s about time to fix it
---
A gemstore bug is usually fixed within few hours
---
Things that cost money have higher priority.  That shouldn't be a shock to anyone that knows anything about business.
---
Very true. I think our last real trip to Charrlands was in Season 2 to recruit them for the Mordremoth fight.
---
And honestly, if a throwaway line had been included then, I'd probably have forgotten it by now, lol.
---
I could have written this post.    
---
Played since beta - pre-purchased. Took a break after HoT, came back March 2019.    
---
Noticed increased monetization (mounts) and focus on skins (instead of QoL) but it didn't bother me much.    
---
Monetizing build templates was what made me look into ESO and let GW2 fade out. I'm not a super dedicated player, and the templates actually do enough for me; but the overall attitude made me look at them negatively and I cannot unsee it (plus, the ridiculous censorship on the forums didn't help).
---
Same problem, I circumvent it by using the normal gw2 exe for my main acc and use lb for my alts.
---
Man, now it sounds like you're just whining
---
Ok I supposed that's the word I could have use. But the fact that you get almost instant gratification in GW2 quicker than in Runescape makes the experience and the game stale IMO.
---
You are defending a game that is blatantly turning into a cash-grab-only-game. I played before there were lootbox skins, rng gemstore items, overproduced outfits, and Raids. The game was peaceful and simple. In every single area of the game, ANET went full greed, cutting back on the things we love to save time and make more money. You deserve the downvotes. Templates should have been praised, but they were overly monetized. Capes could have been amazing but all of the nice ones are ending up in the gemstore only along with every other cool new release. There is nothing left in this game unless you consistently spend an absurd amount of money every month, way more than a subscription would be.
---
Yeah sounds like some support message of last year. Anet has pretty much lost my good faith. They can regain it but it will be impossible if they continue the same way.
---
I don't have hope at all for GW2 anymore.. It's sad.. And it was really stressing me out until I accepted it. This part of my life is over with. 
---
Maybe there will be a GW3? Maybe they will release a Classic Guild Wars refresh?? But I don't have my hopes up. I can't, because I can't afford to be crushed. So, I'm accepting it now.
---
It's just such a bummer. I started playing Guild Wars in 2005, when I was just in 8th grade. I played that religiously and it defines those years for me. 
---
Then I found out about GW2, with that initial reveal as I was heading into Uni and spent too much time playing during Beta weekends and launch weekend during my college years. I graduated, got a job, and HoT kept me sane during the weeks leading up to Prod Go-Live weekends. PoF was excellent (despite it's problems) and made me realize, it was about damn time I got out of the desert myself. 
---
I crafted 4 legendary weapons along the way and had a ton of fun collecting achievements, dungeons, fractals, raids, map completion, exploring old content with mounts, WvW, a bit of PvP here and there, the festivals (especially the first time around). 
---
I headed back to Guild Wars 1 casually and am enjoying the hell out of it again. It feels fresh after all these years. 14 years with this franchise.. crazy.
---
i guess we have more than 10 days.
---
They can't even keep GW2 alive properly. GW3 would be the absolute death blow to the franchise. Nobody wants to start over all again, especially in a MMO from a developer that has proven several times how incompetent and slow they are.
---
so if it's so easy to fix it why haven't you shipped them the code to fix it? oh wait, you don't know how hard it is to fix it and your basing your assumptions very wrongly on what could be a serious issue in the code that cropped up multiple crashes, bugs, and framerate issues  as soon as the "Easy fix" was implemented. stop bitching and stop acting like we are white knighting, we simply understand the absolute bullshit some people go through while having it claimed as an "Easy fix" from a keyboard warrior in his mom's basement when it's a 120 hour job and you expect it out in 8.
---
They tried that with sky scale...people whined it took too long. Gw2 players nowadys want everything instantly or they whine here
---
That is due to rewards. Because the economy is a single server, items are sold for the least amount of profit between players. Adding worthwhile rewards can’t be worth gold because people will farm that content and quickly diminish the value. Adding liquid gold rewards would inflate the economy like a giant hot air balloon. Map completion is one of the more rewarding feelings the game has... but it also means you only get map completion and have to then spend a couple thousand gold to make use of it (by making a legendary). Long term rewards are there, they are not worthwhile and that is the problem.
---
Yes I make about 90g per hour in fractals, so about 3 days / 3 hours played for 700gems.
---
You only make about 70g because you lack titles.
---
Very few players who leave the game seem to actually be gone for good.
---
That's the beauty of an MMO without a subscription. I see so many people that have "quit" that I still see logging in every few months at a minimum.
---
If there is content that those people like, I doubt they won't come back.
---
Hopefully they stay disabled a little longer so that I don't go back to getting BS players who do 1/3 the dps of a dps in my fractal CMs and get away with it because they press 2 utility skills.
---
It really helps to be on voice comms and run with a set group. If you're on JQ, I run with HzH and i've had the most fun with them this year since launch.
---
&gt; You are defending a game that is blatantly turning into a cash-grab-only-game.
---
Am I? I thought I was clear in my response...but I guess not.
---
I deserve the downvotes because you failed to comprehend my comment and/or don't agree with the points I made? All that does is confirm the fact that people use the downvote/upvote system as like/dislike...which is a fact that is already known - did you know that that is not the purpose of the system, and that you downvoting or upvoting someone won't suddenly make them incorrect or correct?
---
Did you know that people begged ANet for templates and capes...including blatantly and clearly telling them that they are willing to pay money for them? Did you also know that every single gemstore item can be bought with gold - a universal unrestricted currency that you earn from every single gamemode?
---
This used to be blocked. You got access via an rng item in Blc’s. Is this open to everyone again?
---
I'm super casual and would be interested! But there are also find of guilds.
---
They still have top tier dps.
---
It used to be an rng item in Blc’s. Wayyyyy worse than the gemstore. I even sent in a support ticket fuming with anger about it.
---
Why exactly do you believe I owe Anet unconditional love and support?
---
I've watched them fuck up both of their games, discard many parts of the community over time without a second thought after they've served their purpose like they were garbage, they've ignored feedback on everything that mattered, but somehow I should do them a favor and just try my best to help the company because.. ?
---
This game is dead for me right now. I do not support the current direction. What difference does it make if it succeeds in its current state or not? If Anet gets their shit together and does something worth supporting then I will.
---
I don't want a guild. I want a small group of 4 or 5 people
---
holy fuck I cannot bear to imagine what it's like just having boobs and playing videogames when men are like this. what the fuck, people?
---
Go back into the game you so love to defend and get off reddit; the true test.
---
I've gotten more precursors than key drops from mobs.
---
Not that I'm complaining, a precursor is worth more than a box of shit and a revive orb.
---
TBF, that's Eureka's purpose; I'll tip my cap to someone on the Ozma mount, somply for putting up with the layers of grind topped with RNG just to get into BA, and then completing it.
---
It would be hard to find a regular group of 4 or 5, maybe try a small guild, you will usually find a small group within to play with
---
I think with all of the higher ups leaving the company we may finally see bug changes come from the new blood. The only issue I see is the big push from NCsoft to make GW2 more profitable and focus on it more. I think 2020 can go either way. 
---
Will Anet turn this ship around or will they peddle more microtransactions?
---
I've sunk a ridiculous amount of hours into Path of Exile in the past week.  It speaks volumes about how I feel about [Conqueror's of the Atlas] and the Metamorph Challenge League.  Grinding Gear Games is like the polar opposite of ArenaNet; there's just something sincere, earnest and heartfelt about GGG's success that makes me want to be part of PoE. 
---
Charrikayu covered it in the other thread, but converting gold from Fractals/Raids to gems deprives players of an important sense of horizontal progression, satisfaction and achievement that comes from pride playing GW2.  Whether it's pride as a result of effort/dedication, teamwork or personal skill; there's nothing gratifying about cosmetic progression that's almost exclusively the domain of GW2's cash shop.  
---
GW2 has already gone into maintenance mode for me.  I don't mean that the game won't receive updates.  The Icebrood Saga will likely continue to deliver appetizer-sized content updates on a regular 2-3 month interval.  However, the most satisfying elements of cosmetic progression will also continue to be gem-store of black lion exclusives and that is unacceptable for a "cosmetic endgame."
---
I've been playing Path of Exile and Rise of the Tomb Raider, and truthfully, I have little motivation to play GW2.  It isn't because the game is "bad."  It's because [ArenaNet did not design GW2 to be played indefinitely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmuy9fyNUjY) and the cracks are starting show.  Over the years we've heard things like "Spaghetti Code", "Poor Documentation" or "UI Work/Menu Design" -- it does not seem like GW2 has a particularly modern development environment.  
---
I don't really want to get into it too much.  It's depressing.  I don't think that the game is "dying" but I do think that it's becoming progressively more bottlenecked by engine limitations and work-arounds, thus, difficult for the devs to work with.  I don't think another expansion will "save" Guild Wars 2.  I'd like to see another expansion, but truthfully, I'm mentally tethered to Grinding Gear Games &amp; Path of Exile now.  I've got probably something like 13-14,000 hours total in GW2, and I'm eager to see what ManaWorks comes up with in several years, but Path of Exile has my attention, and so far, ArenaNet hasn't earned it back.
---
How much did they pay you to post this?
---
The real raids are not the fight. The real raids are finding a group.
---
and yet you still here complaining. if you don't play the game why even bother continue this negative attitude. You like it or not people like you do more harm than Anet themselves.
---
If you unhappy about the game just leave and don't comment. There comes a time when you have to move forward.
---
Your post certainly echoes how a lot of us feel. It’s quite sad because it will fall on blind eyes because they simply don’t care enough if it’s not related to their surreptitious agenda. 
---
Take for example WvW. A lot of WvW players rely on relinks every 2 months and this month they are pushed to 3 months because - SURPRISE - its the unexpected winter holiday season. They could have, oh i don’t know, planned ahead and allowed relinks earlier in December. Considering how important that is for WvW health (albeit a life support game mode these days). I don’t even want to get started on the fake news known as ‘alliances/wvw revamp.’ The only thing they have said on this for literal years now is: it’s a large undertaking. The end. 
---
So I wish they could turn their ship around but at this point they’ve hit an ice burg and the outcome doesn’t look great. They’ve failed on all game modes at this point. Quite sad.
---
I'll give it a fair shake still.
---
Don't worry. Your quickness and alacrity aren't there.
---
Thanks for assuming what I do in my life but he assured in my job I cannot wait a week to fix things because there are certain deadlines...
---
But apparently since anet is working on a game there customers treat them like they are their best friends
---
At 10 hours a day he will run out of stuff to do in a month at best. Much less if he will skip leveling with level boost.
---
Just anet things I guess
---
A small group is going to be very challenging to find especially not a guild as people tend to group up and guilds offer much more than what a few people can. Take my guild, we have 2 raid training days, 1 static (almost 2) fractal training, fractal CM training, allied with a WvW guild who runs regularly, dungeon night and various community things like fashion contests, secret Santa etc. You cant get that with a tiny group of players so most will navigate to guilds.
---
While that feature of the boosts to try before you commit is good, that only gets you access to the base specializations for each class.  If you bring a class into the PvP lobby (which you can do starting at level 2), you get access to all of the elite specializations for that class in the lobby and can practice on training dummies/NPCs/etc. there, without actually needing to play a real PvP game if you don't want to.  That can get you a feel for some of the endgame options the normal boost won't let you try out, so give it a shot as well.
---
Or not enough cape skins sold to afford the bandwidth for the hotfix ;)
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ebmngp/benp_about_banner_fix/  or https://imgur.com/a/ud351Q5
---
And then they removed the exp and karma. So it lost its one thing that was still bringing in players there.
---
If it's an 80 hour fix your company will understand, especially if you document your work. I've had many times where a 8 hour job turned into 30+ from unexpected issues, document to CYA and inform your boss immediately. Welcome to the real world.
---

---
Apparently tomorrow on 16th of December means 20th
---
yes I know, the good thing about gw2 is that it DOESNT have gear progression. but as the years have gone by and content is lackluster, gear progression is what is NEEDED to keep the game fun.
---
Nice for you ... guess not every job is the same and some have strict deadlines 
---
And 1 week is not exactly strict
---
I agree, but put yourself as Anet, would you want your playerbase to know this roadmap ?
---
Yeah make this subreddit another bubble of fake positivity and masturbatory back-patting, that'll help the game XD
---
I still havent played shadowbringers.  ive been clearing out my single player backlog.  Really getting into path of exile again, but eventually I need to play shadowbringers/stormblood and hit up ESO for the story
---
I've posted far more damning topics before, I'm the last person you'd call a shill. But at this point, I don't want the game to die, and I don't want the developers to feel like things are too late.
---
maybe read it again, and if you still don't understand what was written, read it again.
---
Not flex on others. 
---
Flex on Pros, nobody gives a shit if you impress a newbie.
---
You need to pump other veterans.
---
Linking killproofs is dumb since everyone and their mother fakes them, but faking Raid Chairs; Infusions, Titles, Legendarys, Skins is pretty hard since you need to unlock them!
---
I trust a person if I can see he has the Celestial Red Infusion as well as Ad Infinitum. He might know a thing or two about fractals.
---
I trust a person if I can see he's wearing the Legendary PvE Armor as well as Peerless Infusion. He might know a thing or two about raids.
---
I don't trust killproofs for shit.
---
EOTM was created for the chinese servers.  They anticipated having so many chinese players that there'd be huge queues.  It was brought over to NA/EU, even tho the queues were never that large here, and generally only lasted the first few days.  The other problem was that it was useless, since it didn't affect real wvw at all, so people started to ignore it.  It then turned into a karma farm till they got rid of karma and xp, and now it's basically ignored.
---
You can join multiple guilds, so if you don't care about guild halls or missions I'd just join a small guild for chat purposes.
---
I have 16 legendaries and played every single day since launch.  When PoF came out, I beat the story in a single day and was shocked how little I enjoyed it and how much I didnt care for anything new.

Ah ok since you clearly missed what the post said that is quite entertaining
---
I for one like Guild Wars 2 much more than the other MMORPG offerings at the moment. Compared to other games I feel it has some of the best design choices.
---
 It might be lacking content compared to other games but I think no other game utilises content the way Guild Wars 2 does. 
---
That being said I'm a relatively new player player playing it casually.
---
I wonder, what content would veteran players want to see?
---
It's Amazon, what do you expect.
---
Wvw alliance for 2022...... Hype👍
---
Anet did, they said they are hoping with fingers crossed that the first hotfix after wintersday patch they can ship it out.
---
And it is not unusual that hotfixes come just few hours after a patch ... apparently this time it is not important enough.
---
2015 had less powercreep.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/p9QCNoe.png](https://i.imgur.com/p9QCNoe.png)
---
I don't care, you annoyed me with YOUR petty drooling at the mouth comment. You're pathetic.
---
Is still a great game for new PvE players. It's us vets and WvW players that are kinda getting the shaft.
---
Oh boy.
---
Not really since a lot of their dps depends on banners but I am not a warrior player cannot tell how much exactlx but at least twice as much as any other class
---
I played since launch day and one of my guild mates left for wow.  it blew my mind that he left because he hated wow and did nothing but complain about it.
---
I on and off played FF14 on the side and started playing it more and more.  I too eventually left for wow, because at the end of the day mmos are about growth.  despite the ups and downs of wow, theres always more of it and more to do like it or not.  
---
Ill always pray gw2 succeeds but I think its done after next year
---
Well that’s something else but for now they are a mechanic
---
Ye I hope I will spend money on the gemstore next year too ... fingers crossed
---
I‘ll use both and have no problems. But sometimes when i open TacO with admin it‘s not there. So I kill it with task manager and try it again.
---
What most players fail to realize is that the devs don’t decide on the content and such. They simply build the world they are told to create
---
It pretty much feels the same for me. I see some other games becoming like this too like League of Legends, where they are obviously turning their game into a cash grab machine and it's really repelling me. 
---
I was hyped about finally getting capes in GW2 as I have some awesome designs for characters in mind but after remembering what happened to mount skins I lost this enthusiasm sadly.
---
Zergfights are dropping good wxp
---
Maybe they are and we don’t know
---
I don't know enough about the current meta to understand war dps vs ren dps.  But outdpsed by a healer, lol wtf.  He must have thought you wanted that shout heal bs lol
---
I wish they would just try replacing eb with it for a month. I think it's a way better map.
---
you hit the nail on the head, but for me it happened when PoF came out.  now I go back to single player games, wow and path of exile
---
well,those last 15 ppl which hoped that guild wars 3 is a thing,can finaly sleep like sheeps.
---
And don't even get me started on balance. Apparently they are working on it, but 2 years of fighting exactly the same things wore me down. Too late.
---
They lose a whopping 100 power/precision/ferocity compared to everyone else. That's insignificant.
---
For me the even worse part is the constantly rising gold to gem price conversion. I used to farm a ton of gold back in the day and often converted gold to gems but as the course is not going below 35g I just stopped buying gem store items altogether.
---
All we can get grinding the game as f k (okay, 96% jf it) is SHIT in compare of gemstore. How's things going in other MMO's?   
---
And almous I'm tired of 2-3 weeks "patches" that consists of 1 traint bugfix, 1 trait description fix, 2 skills fix for 1 class and then 80-100+ rows of GEMSHOP additions.   
---
noice
---
ESO is fantastic and its the mmo ive put the least amount of time into
---
It’s at least 5%
---
Horde or alliance? always looking for more people to derp around with and i have a lot of new toons to level
---
Horde for me but I leveled 2 alliance toons and enjoyed it a lot
---
What this banner situation is proving is that there are folks among those who are upset about them not being active... that use them to mask that they aren't pulling as much weight as they could be.
---
They might still not be great, but I think they won't be as bad. There's a weird community expectation, if you do 8k dps on Skorvald as a dps you'll be kicked, but if you do it as a power berserker BS no one will say anything even though the class is nuts and can outdps some dps classes. So people actually put in enough effort to become passable with dps, but just coast/leech with bs.
---
&gt; select x8 each 2 hours and press buy
---
vs
---
&gt; leave your character afk for 2 hours to stack with autoclicker
---
If this is the price of rework - ill pay it withoutany doubts.
---
I thought Stormblood and especially the post-Stormblood story were pretty good, especially by MMO standards. But Shadowbringers really knocks it out of the park, it was a damn enjoyable and decently told CRPG story even, not just by MMO comparison.
---
The difference between BS and DPS warrior is only 2.7k. That's player problem, banners have nothing to do with it.
---
Proper BS should be pretty much as good as other dps players, unless more CC is needed in certain fight.
---
Gooood luck with it! I'm alliance primarily but zandalari druids and vulpera are cool
---
I don't want to believe you, but the length of time between the last fractal/raid release leads me to believe otherwise. If people have no interest in doing achievements or collecting a new weapon/armor set, there's literally 1-2 hours of content for them every 3-4 months.
---
I just want the Tengu to be a playable race.
---
Give them their own separate story or something for an expansion. That's all I ask for.
---
I did the exact same thing - I've been playing GW2 for seven years, but I just got into FFXIV this summer with Shadowbringers and honestly haven't looked back. Another friend of mine who did the same thing that I did came to a similar conclusion as well - that even though FF has that monthly subscription, we'd rather pay for the clear communication than continue to get nothing from anet, even if it's free. All of the coolest skins (both armor and mount) in gw2 being gem store only was the final nail in the coffin - I really love how I look something up in FF and it's like, oh, I can just play the game to get this and not have to shell out $10 for a cape.  
---
I still love gw2, love all the great times I had with my friends when it was doing better, still love all of my characters (and, for the most part, still love the world - except Rytlock. I hate him.). I really do wish Arenanet the best and I hope I can look back on this time and say, hey, remember when gw2 was really rough but they got it back on track in 2020? But it's not really feeling like that's going to happen.
---
Beautiful comment.  It’s the reason I haven’t touched the game in awhile and am likely done with it entirely. 
---
When gameplay revolves around determining what’s the best gold/time ratio (SW) so you can make enough to convert gold to gems to make a purchase in their cash shop, you have a bad game.
---
But I agree with whoever said this first: most of us are not the target audience; we’re the product.  The whales are the target demo and everyone else exists to enhance their gameplay, usually through comparison.  The haves and have nots.  
---
No thanks.  I’ve been enjoying so many other games recently I have regretted logging on once.  Daily rewards?  Manipulation to get you into the game.
---
The fact that Black Lion Chest keys are not a weekly (or monthly) reward is baffling; people are rushing through tutorial levels weekly to obtain one and then get trash.
---
Artists: do you enjoy creating beautiful things, designing wonderful accoutrements, but having drop rates so low only a select few will be able to enjoy them?
---
Capitalism the video game!  A big no thanks from me.  If Anet decides to appreciate their players some day in the future I may return.  Otherwise, peace.  Too many great games and experiences to waste it on a game that condescends most of its player base.
---
Also can’t wait for gambling legislation to catch up.  I would LOVE to see the drop rate numbers so we can see how truly fucked they made the system.
---
Warrior with banners is a DPS class.  It can keep up with DPS players for the most part.  If they are pulling support level DPS or more than a few thousand less than good dps players, they are shit.
---
Sunk cost fallacy can, and usually does, hit most people.  I felt that for awhile.
---
But Kylo Ren was right... you have to let the past die.  As much as I’d like a GW3 for the aesthetic, I don’t think it could ever live up to what fans want and would only disappoint.  We see it all the time now.
---
It's too late, the game is nearing maintenance mode as explained by Deroir on this [clip](https://clips.twitch.tv/WildSnappyGoblinSSSsss)
---
You can ask a thief or a messmer to port you up to that cliff and then pick up some of the mastery points in that area to be able to get the bunny. Or if you have teleport to a friend you can ask someone to move to the waypoint at the bunny farm and use that item.
---
Otherwise there are mastery points from the story as well so maybe that can help. But i would deffo ask in chat if someone can port you up to the bunny farm. It is the easier way. You still need the mastery points for the leap to go on but as i said there are several avaiable as soon as you get in to that area.
---
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmkay
---
yeah I know what a warrior is, I just don't know what ren hits typically.
---
They had an excellent formula in gw1 and instead of doubling down on it they threw it to the trash.
---
Id love to play socially but I've brand new. Hope that isn't a problem?
---
no1 care,i tried to explain this in 2 pts and after that i just logged rene XD
---
The people who made GW1 what it was left long ago, some even before GW2 was released. Today’s Anet is a bunch of random people strapped together, especially after the layoffs.
---
Condi stealth scrapper, ist pretty funny to play
---
ArenaNet is going to have a hard time improving the game without feedback, considering they hardly ever do surveys or polls.
---
Constructive feedback tends to be better than purely negative feedback, but negative feedback is not useless. This is necessary.
---
&gt;If you unhappy about the game just leave and don't comment. 
---
Are you happy about the game? If so, why?
---
this is what i had hope dynamic UI meant.
---
Didn't BenP say that they would hopefully be fixed in the first hotfix after this week's patch? I don't think we've had a hotfix yet.
---
Honestly I gave up last year. My account is only 4 years old but the game is just so boring now. All the guilds I’m in died (except one, cause streamer guild) and the members moved onto other games.
---
Hi I've been playing GW2 on and off since release but embarrassingly enough I've never tried fractals. I tried soloing the first one and while I think it's possible, it would take ages. What should I know before jumping in, and what's an easy way to get into a party as a beginner?
---
the game is on maintenance mode for 2 years already when all the good DEV left for Amazon 4 years ago.
---
also, even though many parts of the game are grindy, theyre usually split up into multiple layers to give you a sense of progress.
---
my goal rn is to make the summoner relic weapon from heavensward. i'm currently at the part where i need umbrite (tomestones)	and crystal sand. looking at the ways to obtain the sand, i decided crafter's scrips were the way i wanted to go about it. (i btw really liked that there were so many different ways to get it).
---
so to get sand, i need scrips. to get scrips, i need to level my crafters high enough to consistently make collectibles. to do that without going broke, i need to also level my gatherers. i have now been literally only doing gathering and crafting for like a month
---
and i am LOVING it, because the grind is engaging and varied (and fun) and i feel like i'm actually progressing. and in the end ill have my sand, and also the bonus of having my crafters/gatherers leveled which will help me out a lot when it comes to other stuff.
---
my favorite thing is i never feel bottlenecked by anything - everything i need for this grind, i can set out to get. i never have to actually stop, i simply have to set new subgoals.
---
Just use a clicking macro, iirc it is allowed
---
Its 90g per day!
---
You need 1hour to complete; you cannot chain-farm fractals!
---
You do CMs + T4, recs once a day and if you have Fractal God Title you get about 85-90gold within an hour it takes you to clear everything.
---
You need to spend years farming those Titles, its a gigantic fucking timesink but its worth if you keep playing the game and keep on farming Fractals!
---
You sink a lot of Gold into the Title too, so you kinda need to keep farming Fractals to get even again before starting to gain profit!
---
Without the Titles veterans farmed for years, new players only get about 60-70 gold per day in Fractals. You only need about 40min to 1h in good to very good groups; and 1h30min if your team fucking sucks.
---
Its not Inflation is was allways the case, back in the day before 61 nerf you made even more Gold.
---
Or, you know, maybe the fix isn't that simple?
---
No they wouldn't.  Adding WvW skirmish tickets doesn't turn EOTM into the Queensdale champ train replacement.
---
progressing faster is a form of p2w. basicly reducing the time needed to complete something (on this topic: wvw/pvp reward tracks) by effectivly 25%. if you have the item you need 6 hours to get to a point where people without the item need 8 hours.
---
yes, it is no powercreep p2w, which is obviously the worst form, but it is speedup p2w.
---
and yes, i can buy it with ingame gold, but it is yet another item with progress speed increasing buffs, that is implemented via gem shop and not in the game. Thats the most frustrating point for me.
---
I actually don’t share a lot of there points, I think the game is underrated and a blast. I been playing since GW1 and became an even better fan in GW2, unlike most I find the game very challenging and at times down-right difficult. I love leisure play and thats what the game gives me, maybe because I am not a super-rush, dungeon or PvP player like many that seem to get bored easy. That said the game is missing Social Marketing that gets people excited to jump in and join in with others. That is were Anet fails for me and needs to get to it, I lacking great skills buy a lot of things from the store and watch videos on youtube that get my gaming urges going. This games does not show any age as far as graphics and competes with any and all games in the visual department so there isn’t a problem there. Oh and Toasters where do I get one?
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but was 2019 not the deciding year for gw2? they told us no exp 3 but Season 5 right after S4 what was a big ufff for me. The constantly delay of the S4 episodes which was again a big uff for me. Then they said "Expansion worth content" and again this Saga was a big ufff for me. Also the constantly delay of content and no communication effort from anet. I am also a Gw1 vet and I'm sad to tell u this m8:  
---
No matter what Anet will do in 2020, Gw2 will still be at this point in 2021. The content release will be the same. The Gemstore will be the same. The wishes will be the same. The communication policy will be the same.   
---
So in total Gw2 is not dead. Probably won't be dead in 2021, but the great days are sadly over.
---
while many others do
---
I got it by now. But my fingers hurt :(
---
I noticed one of these... :( 
---
 So here take this... :D
---
Assuming AGS doesn't turn it into a carebear theme park MMO.
---
I would use [d912pxy](https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy). Helped improve my performance significantly.
---
Definitely check achievement panel for crystal oasis and other maps you can access. Three you will find some really easy masteries like finding dead bodies I believe. Also AP. 
---
Majority of your masteries will be coming from achievements and there is always more than needed. Good luck!
---
Go to the LFG panel. Click Fractals, and then Tier 1. Join any fractal below 20, or if you don't see a number, join dailied.
---
It should take you 1 to 2 minutes to find a group, and then you're basically done.
---
You don't need to do any special prep, wear any special gear, or have any special knowledge for T1. Just go. Follow your group, ask questions if you really don't understand and go.
---
It has reward tracks.  Are you thinking about pip/skirmish rewards?  Because that's only WVW skirmish tickets really.  Other rewards from pip chests are gotten much more efficiently from PvE maps now.
---
"Games that let you buy better gear or allow you to make better items then everyone else at a faster rate and then makes the game largely unbalanced even for people who have skill in the game without paying."[urban dictionary]
---
getting items on a faster rate than others is a form of p2w by the standard definition.
---
what is the part that should show u didnt play for a while? i only see a pic of hoarder
---
At this point Anet will have to go big or go home. I used to clock in 6-8 hours a day when the game came out. My play time was pretty consistent until the past 2-3 years. Currently, i clock in about 10-30 minutes a day because I feel there is nothing to do. The stories are short, fractals are stagnant, raid communities are getting quieter along with WvW, and skins don’t really interest me anymore. I have skins out the ass, where I feel like there is no need to develop any more.
---
They need a real HoT sized expac in the future if they want veterans like me to start playing more again and using the gem store.
---
Then dont look at it🤡🤡
---
Try Win+Shift+S to make a quick snip
---
fractail is a good way to make gold, mats, and ascended chest, for t1 you don't need anything just enter with a party and go, if you want to be prepared you can watch some video on youtube, but only thing you need is practice to learn some mech, when you get some gear you can try t2 and go on to the t4, while you scale the fractal some instability come's up, some times are funny and usefull, some are a pain in the a\*\*, but nevermind with a good party you can do all the fractal without any problems
---
Where did I imply that any of this is good for the game or Anet?
---
All I'm pointing out is that the original comment made it sound like some bridge was burned where players who left will never come back.
---
Lots of people quit between core and HoT. Lots came back. Plenty of people quit after HoT, then came back for PoF. 
---
I've seen 13 years worth of players quitting and unquitting GW. I'm just pointing out the fact that the lack of a subscription model drives far more players to come back after quitting than other MMOs.
---
OK Zoomer
---
Just take them. I don't want them anymore after 7 years of straight meta.
---
Normally they would, but they wanted the reindeer to go faster, so they had to hoof it.
---
I really, really hope so. I would love to see LA or Spamadan as full as they used to be.. That would bring me so much joy.
---
I don't miss them
---
Everything™ is viable in PvE
---
&gt; ... “friends at ANet” ...
---
Friends don’t push customer-unfriendly tactics onto friends.
---
You know, maybe if all of us didn’t get so emotionally invested into this game, we’d be be able to more objectively celebrate the good stuff that happens and point out and demand change of the things that are done poorly.
---
But for that, we need to understand that they are a business and we are their customers: we are not their friends.
---
I don’t know if I’m here for the anymore.  I basically lived on GW1 and GW2 has been a train wreck from the beginning.  It isn’t the same dev team, it doesn’t feel like the same world, and it sure as hell doesn’t seem to be made with the same enthusiasm and inspiration.
---
They're in full milk mode.
---
Since I hit the cap I've been focussing on playing for achievements. Doing old content, stuff I haven't cared for in a while. Helping new players in dungeons (to max out the dungeon frequenter AP), playing old story content. Maxing out slayer/weaponmaster stuff
---
I don’t remember the last time I actually played some of the new content (probably the around the beetle mount?)  and I haven’t been checking out this place as often as I previously did.
---
So to come back to:
---
&gt; We confirmed soon after that O’Brien had once been tasked with exploring the potential of making Guild Wars 3, but his project never given the green light from NCsoft.
---
is a massive kick in the nuts.
---
Fuck. GW2 is decent but it’s simply not for me. And even if there is no proof that GW3 would have been more like GW1, I’d still grab the chance that it might be, with both my hands.
---
To make matters worse, they keep lowering the in-game rewards, or making them more difficult to get.
---
Sounds like a vip system sort of thing..? Well I guess if it’s not too expensive it’s probably not too bad but the direction is definitely worrying lol
---
Anyone hoping Anet will begin to communicate is delusional at this point. Whenever they started it lasted a month or two.
---
Take an upvote for the commercial reference!
---
I like your reply a lot because there are a lot of things I should think about in there, so thank you.
---
The reason why I'm questioning this take is not because I think you're wrong--it would be really messed up to only hire people who come from a specific class of wealth, and it would put them in a bubble of only like-minded people.
---
However, part of what I'm not understanding is why you feel that everyone who would be hired in Arenanet's diversity push would all be people who are in that upper-middle class bubble, and thus wouldn't actually have anything new to contribute. From what I understand of the article, what they are trying to counteract is the existing culture of "You can only get in if you have connections or experience." This should open doors for anyone who has the potential to learn the skills they need, not just upper-middle class people who have an in, but people who haven't managed to get a foot in the door because they're lacking resources or experience, but who have the skill and desire. The push to bring in more than just 'the same' should be an improvement. 
---
I also want to clarify that you've suggested that I am part of the upper-middle wealth class, so everything I think and do is stuck in that bubble... but my parents are immigrants who work in a takeout Chinese restaurant. Not getting invited to dinner parties here. I'm still unconvinced that someone's relative poorness is what makes their artistic ideas different from someone who is richer, because I do think that my growing up on Chinese TV and anime/manga puts me closer to other artists who grew up with those Asian influences, regardless of class and country. 
---
Wealth class changes a person's priorities and definitely perspective, but I don't think that someone who is middle class has a distinct style that differentiates their work from someone who is poor or someone who is rich. Being rich gives so many more opportunities to develop as a creative because you can actually, you know, devote time to creating rather than working to stay alive, but that doesn't necessarily give someone taste or vision. 
---
&gt;If you find yourself unable to empathise with someone that's a different race from you, then there's already a word for that, its called racism and its not a grand feat that takes "amazing amounts of empathy" to not be one.
---
My reasoning behind my statement is that personally, I would think that I have more in common with a queer Asian billionaire who went through the same cultural struggles, even if they have a billion times more money than me, than with a born-and-bred American from the Bible belt in the same wealth class as me, but lived through completely different experiences. We could get along and learn from each other, but our perspectives would be very different in most parts of life other than our relationship with money. That's how I see it.
---
I'm interested in playing support, particularly heals but don't know which profession I'd be most interested in, yet. I've been looking at Tempest, Druid, Revenant, and Firebrand. One possible tie breaker would be having a strong condi dps build, as I'm more interested in condi than power. 
---
My questions is: do any of these professions have a good and accepted condition damage build, at least in raids?
---
Seems like this is not as good of a time to make the jump from ESO to GW2 as I thought...
---
You ain't off the Hoof yet though.
---
The only problem with this "it's like Dry Top and Silverwastes" bullshit, because that's what it is, BULLSHIT, is that those two maps got updated every 2 weeks.
---
Dry Top was completed 6 weeks after it was released. Same thing for Silverwastes.
---
ty, for the info. Will see about that next time I login.
---
Oh, well since I have been gone 4 years I didn't think about that. TY for the info.
---
[What do you mean the shield hides the cape?](https://m.imgur.com/Tmxnaa7)
---
Sad but very truthful read .
---
I think those are really nice looking.
---
You can't compare GW1 story to GW2. It's like comparing Lord of the Rings to Marvel/Transformers movies.
---
I said it because all other backpacks vanish if you have a shield stowed on your back. Never thought capes would be an exception to the rule seeing as how they're backpacks.
---
Yea like all dx12 games today! Thanks gonna give a look. :)
---
MightyTeapot is currently discussing this article on his [twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/mightyteapot).
---
Dungeons sucked. But that didn't mean they had to let them die. Sprucing them up and making them fun would have gone a long way and helped the longevity of the game. New dungeons every few LW Episodes. New dungeons every expansion. 
---
It doesn't take a genius to see how that would keep players invested.
---
&gt;Something to Make WvW Feel Like what it's meant to be: A large Scale War. with genuine tactics, Communications, and strategy beyond " Throw bodies "
---
Use strategy to beat zergs.
---
I normally don't comment that long on stuff like this, but this is the kinda post where I just have the urge to write something from my heart.
---
To be brutally honest: If the game wouldn't have these few wonderful roleplay possibilities (chairs, wardrobe system, being able to decorate in a guild hall, dye system, variety of armor and weapon skins, down to earth skins like the newer metal legion shirt and the christmas pullover), I'd be gone too. 
---
* WvW is not my cup of tea because it's just boring to follow a big zerg and go into brain afk mode.
---
* PvP is okay but I'm just a too salty of a dude for this gamemode, absolutely my problem, I know.
---
* Living Story maps are great but have 0 replay value.
---
* The waiting time in between the episodes is WAY too long in comparison to the quality of the episodes (short, pretty good storywise)
---
* One new cape / glider a week simply is not enough to keep things fresh
---
Nevertheless, the german roleplay community is great and I'm absolutely positive when it comes to gw2 and it's future. I was part of the side that said that things will change for the better, after the mass dismissal. I feel confirmed.
---
The prologue was a blast, the skins are awesome and those QoL imrpovements were SO much needed, when we look back at the last few weeks. We also have actual communication now (a thing that gets easily overlooked from the community)
---
I hope that we continue like that. I want gw2 to live and prosper.
---
Right kind of you!
---
If there's still any codes left from that stack, I would happily receive one. If not, then thank you for offering to the community!
---
Best wishes this Wintersday!
---
deroir is in maintenance mode since he finally stopped lying to everyone and showed everyone what he really thinks about the game.
---
lost all credibility.
---
An extremely hard to swallow pill, yet it's true. Thank you for writing this. I'd suggest making a standalone post but, knowing this sub, it'd get downvoted into oblivion because people don't like harsh truth.
---
Small group of good players still can beat large group. You suggest that small group of bad player would have given advantage over others jsut because they got more people. That's just nonsense. If your team has no coverage, you should lose the objectives, that easy it is. The problem aren't amounts of bodies, the problem are players that bullied commanders out by actively sabotaging the gameplay by bad builds or not listening on voice, or even just outright trolling, so there is usually just one commander top, so obviously there can't be more groups. If you want more groups, work on attitude of people or tag up as well, and lead your small group. With more tags, there will be more groups.
---
If I wanted to go fight small scale and fair fights I would just go to SPvP.
---
&gt; That's the beauty of an MMO without a subscription. I see so many people that have "quit" that I still see logging in every few months at a minimum.
---
Yes, just to realize all their friends and guildmates are gone.
---
MMOs, B2P or not, don't work if there's no one to play with.
---
It worked great for the last 7 years, I mean, look at us now!

I found the LW S2 achievements really fun back in the day. Lots of AP plus you get one of the cooler item sets imo and a title "light in the darkness" iirc as a reward.
---
&gt; If you unhappy about the game just leave and don't comment. 
---
If you're unhappy about the subreddit, just leave and don't comment :D.
---
2015?! Take your fake positivity out of here, you filthy fanboy!
---
You're approaching the problem from the wrong direction. You don't punish people for doing the objectives of the game mode, you supply more objectives that cover how others want to play. I've said for a while that when you choose a map to enter into WvW you should be given a choice of what role you are going to fill. Each role should have specific objectives that they need to complete in order to earn participation. Take these for example.
---
1. Scout - earns participation by actually moving around the map. Can be as simple as staying within a certain range of the enemy without engaging in fights or touching so many of those stupid heal kits that hang on the walls for no reason anymore. Can expand to killing cows and taking sentry points or other poi.
---
2. Havoc - participation from taking camps, killing cows, flipping sentries, tapping keeps and fighting
---
3. Commander - obvious
---
4. Support - how many boons you apply to your party. How many control effects to you apply to the enemy.
---
5. Healer - How much healing/condi cleansing do you do.
---
6. DPS - 
---
Of course these are just thoughts and isn't the end all be all list but consider the impact a system like this would have. The loot in WvW is crap enough but how about being a healer/support that might not tag as many enemies as the com or dps? They get less for doing their job. Scouts are vital to most good tactics but aren't often included in groups for participation because they take up valuable slots. Outnumbered? Get a small squad mark yourselves all as havoc and start back capping camps so they can't tier up the keeps and towers. 
---
You could even go so far as to show the coms what the entering players have chosen and show the player other players whose choices match with theirs. Come in as havoc? Here are the other players that are doing the same. Come in as a scout, here are the coms and oh hey coms, here is a scout.
---
Then every 3 ticks (5 times an hour) give loot drops for those who have been successful for each of those 3 ticks in the role they chose.  Hell give them 2 green unidentifieds. It would only be 10 drops an hour but it would go a long way to fixing the loot issue. The bottom line is, you should reward people for doing the part of the game mode they find fun. They'll do it more often and the populations will increase.
---
"What's Guild Wars about?"  
---
"dRaGoNs!!!"
---
The capes kinda indicate already that they'll be tripling down on microtransactions. We've only seen the beginning of GW2's transition into becoming more akin to mobile gatcha games.
---
Honestly, there was a long time where I was entirely satisfied with my cosmetic progression and I just enjoyed playing the game because the mechanics were fun. It's the same reason why people play League of Legends. You don't play a 40 minute game of League of Legends because you're after 80 blue essence--you do it because you enjoy the gameplay and the thrill of winning.
---
I was the same way for GW2 structured PvP and WvW for a long time. 5v5 wvw skirmishes were a blast, as was roaming for duels. But with the power creep they introduced and basically total abandonment in any iteration in those game modes it just got too stale for me to stick around.
---
2019 was, yeah. One big plotline ended and the company had a chance to show us the future. They paid to rent a venue for a pile of marketing, made fun of some of the competitive game modes, and told us there wouldn't be an expansion.
---
That's it, that's the future. They told us what to expect, but a decent amount of people still seem to think there's an expansion or something like it on the way for some reason. I don't understand it.
---
Try GW2Launcher64. I stopped using LB  awhile back due to having quite a few issues with it.
---
PvP on other classes, take a few months break?
---
Welcome to gw2 where every new episode release/festival release will break your Client for the first week it’s out. 
---
Just wait for client bug fixes that come... eventually. But when the game is stable for the 2 weeks before a new release to come in, as soon as they release some type of new gameplay prepare for crashes. 
---
It’s not your computer or your internet, it’s gw2 engine. Fixing the client will not work, just prepare for dc”s for the next few days. Best of luck
---
because i am enjoying the game?
---
I mean what you're talking about is also totally what they're doing and I don't think that's bad. It's a great irony that the Sons have been taken in because Jormag appears to them as the thing that's most likely to appeal to them.
---
The gods accepted Kormir, there's really no coming back from that, sadly.
---
But seriously, now that you mention that, the parts of the PoF story I remember most tend to revolve around Joko and Kralk. I'm probably letting that cloud my judgement. I don't remember much about Balthazar beyond "grr i kill dragon", but most of what I remember from HoT is "Well, the NPC's we're looking for aren't here, let's do some sidequests in this zone for a breather" for every zone.
---
There are different kinds of groups/players. Every group has a different requirements and there is nothing wrong with it.
---
If T4 dailies can be done in 15-30 minutes - some people don't want to spend 90 minutes there.
---
Ofc sometimes people being too toxic, overreact, call names, blocking etc, but.. that just the way it is, welcome to online gaming :D
---
*"What could be the NEW purpose(s) of Edge of the Mists?"*
---
First, keep the current EotM as is.
---
Second, create a modified EotM map for use as:
---
\-Guild Hall
---
\-Structured GvG Arena with timed/points matches; GvG tournaments
---
\-Conquest Map (as in GW1); could also be a Guild Challenge
---
\-Gauntlet/Onslaught/Hold Out: build/upgrade using the time and resources made available before the assault begins; sortie to recap/repair/upgrade important objectives and survive until the timer runs out; (Or kill the enemy Boss) 
---
\-Big Bad Boss Challenge: Multiple World Bosses spawn at once (maybe random/rotation) need to be defeated before timer runs out; Bosses and minions will fight the other Boss/ minions or maybe assist each (Call for Help)
---
\-An additional Festival battle/farming map populated with appropriate decor and enemies i.e. snowmen, dragon minions, etc. akin to the Labyrinth
---
Additionally, make all mounts usable, but they cannot bypass defenses by going over walls (auto dismount, rider damage; invisible dome partially/fully disabled once wall(s) breached); where and when applicable and appropriate.
---
These could all well be unfeasible/too much work, but EotM is such a cool map that I think that it would be great if a modified version could be made for newer and/or seasonal content.
---
It is!  You do need to own the relevant expansions to test out the elite specs, though, so there's that.
---
Holy shit what the fuck
---
This is good Too. Encourages Diversity and Discourages Blob Tactics in a less directly harsh way . 
---
Always good to get multiple angles on something.
---
Dude Mike Z has been in charge of game direction for a long time and him and Mike O are super similar in terms of direction, which is basically none.  He became Game Director not long after Collin left years ago after Mike O took it over temporary and **didn't do fucking anything**.
---
Mike Z is going to be just as ineffective as Mike O was, and he has demonstrated being ineffective as a Game Director for years now.
---
they left because anet abandoned gw1 like they abandoned gw2.
---
To discourage zerging without preventing it altogether, and reward those who fight while outnumbered instead running away, I'd go with I would go with On-the-Fly Dynamic Balance measures vs players, that would have no effect vs NPCs. 
---
* Spread AoE Priority.  If two of the same AoE stack on the same player, they would not stack. If there's 10 enemies, one would hit 5, the other one would hit the other five. If there's 7 enemies, the one with the highest damage would hit 5, the other one would hit 2. If there's 5 or less enemies, they would only be hit by the one with the highest damage. Any surplus hits that have been capped would still be able to hit NPCs, then objects, trying to waste as few hits as possible. 
---
* Critical Damage Proration. Each skill that can critically hit would receive a 'critical proration' value, starting with a default value for all skills as a baseline. The higher the value, the less damage it will do when stacked after other critical hits within a short time. The faster the hits the greater the effect. So using 3 skills with 0 activation time within less than 1s would do less damage than using them within 3s. The effect would not be very noticeable 1v1s, tho. Hitting disabled enemies would also slightly increase the effect, but additively, not multiplicatively. 
---
 * This is similar to how those combos with lots of hits in fighting games do less and less damage the more hits are chained in the combo to keep fights from ending too fast, but only for critical hits.  
---
* Condition Stacking cap vs players. Limit how much each single condition can stack on a player, and how many stacks a player can have in total between all conditions. I'd go with a cap of 25 for each condition, except burning, capped at 15), then a cap of 65 stacks total across all conditions. 
---
* Cowardice. A new hidden WvW effect would trigger whenever a player hits another player in WvW maps. It will count the number of ally players within a large radius of the attacker and the number of enemies of that enemy's team team within a large radius of the attacked. If the difference is *more than double* in your favor (3v1, 11vs5, 25vs12, 50vs24, etc) the hidden effect will give you a stack of Cowardice. 
---
 * Each stack of Cowardice would last 5 seconds and all stacks would gain +1s every time you hit an enemy, up to a cap of 300s.  Being defeated by an enemy that gains WXP from your defeat while under Cowardice would clear all stacks, and give that enemy bonus WXP and drops based on the total duration of all stacks. 
---
     * Cowardice won't clear with defeats by NPCs, environment like lava, or suicide like fall damage, it will be shared between all characters, and it will not tick while outside WvW.
---
 * Cowardice discourages relying on stacking numbers to gain an edge over the enemy with harsh deterring effects that remove temporary advantages and some rewards, without affecting the base gameplay. 
---
     * At 10 stacks, it disables temporary bonuses like Objective Auras and Nourishment/Enhancement effects. 
---
     * At 25 stacks, it also freezes participation gains, disables enemy drops, WXP and warscore from enemy kills, but it does not affect objective captures like taking a keep or a camp.
---
     * But it would not affect the player's base build: equipment, upgrades, skills and traits. 
---
     * And the effects are completely individual. A coward tagging along would not make you earn less rewards, unless they come with enough friends to greatly outnumber whoever you are fighting, and a few kills from a passing zerg would give just just a few stacks of cowardice that would not go past the 10 stacks limit and clear in a few seconds. While a huge zerg actively using numbers to sweep over maps uncontested would notice the effects as long as there's a small group of courageous  individuals who can last enough against them while greatly outnumbered, or even defeat them.
---
I wish I could claim to be Morgan Freeman,...I wish I could make that claim. Poor Andy.
---
That's how the meta has evolved though. WvW is essentially a social pvp mode. Learn who your neighbors are and join them to fight the opposing servers. I've been on several servers and the one thing commanders do is ask that people join their comms. They don't really care if you speak or not but they do want everyone to work together in the group. Roaming is not entirely dead either. It's one of the most consistent types of GW2 videos you can find on YouTube outside of pve related ones. 
---
Something like full Soldiers P/P thief would not work in WvW btw. If you define "work" in a pve setting like taking a camp or a keep your damage on said Lord/Supervisor wouldn't be that impressive. If you define it in a pvp setting for fighting another zerg group, you're sure as hell not doing any damage in Soldiers nor are you providing any meaningful support. So just surviving doesn't mean you're useful. 
---
Also, these tactics already exist to a degree. It's not uncommon to have multiple tags on a map working together. Havoc and roaming groups already do these things that you suggest.
---
So far they’re reskinned dungeon sets to look significantly different. So for Sab we’re likely to see remade crucible weapons. I just hope the ones for four winds are good as that’s my fav festival
---

---
&gt; ...gw2 has been a p2w game fashion wise...
---
That's not what p2w means.
---
Literally nothing in gw2 can be classified as p2w; none of it fits the description of p2w.
---
&gt; ...I’m not sure what ur upset about...
---
You're an idiot if you think I'm upset about anything.
---
Please, pls.
---
&gt; I headed back to Guild Wars 1 casually and am enjoying the hell out of it again. It feels fresh after all these years. 14 years with this franchise.. crazy.
---
Lot of people are in the same boat. After All these years GW1 is still a unique gam that holds up well, yet Anet keeps doing nothing with it..
---
When I was looking for software dev jobs in the Seattle area, I looked into ArenaNet. They severely underpay their engineers. I know game developers generally get paid less and are driven by their love for the game, but I would have a hard time focusing at work if my pay was 30-40% lower than other local companies.
---
/wave
---
not enough snowflakes. Feelssadman
---
Yes, probably the people over in the marketing and sales departement of ArenaNet.
---
Ben P.eepoHappy
---
Ah! I must have misread at some point in the middle of that. The clarification makes it easier for sure. 
---
I had misassumed it to be permanent until death.
---
Try installing into C:\Games\Guild Wars 2
---
&gt; was just curious if what in your opinion is the most enjoyable to play solo as I work night shifts so on my days off I'll probably be playing late nights alone..
---
It's active enough that there are always people around at weird times. You should be fine/
---
I don't think anybody is arguing this is premium content. But as a way to make okay rewards for festival content that shouldn't suck out a ton of dev resources for something that only comes once a year? I think it's fine. Players have been asking them to reuse assets here are there given that they have plenty and without weapons being dye-able, some people actually like this stuff. Let them do reuse all they want if it makes festival releases more rewarding or fun even if it's not that brand new. 
---
We keep running this "Anet only puts rewards in the gemstore", even when talking about weapons of all things, when they've actually improved drastically in season 4 and so far in season 5 with in-game rewards. Did people on here forget how most of season 3 was an assortment of odd backpacks and occasional 1-off helmets, boots, or glove pieces? In Season 4 we got several weapon and armor sets that had upgraded versions each, it was generally quite well done.
---
I doubt we'll ever get world 3, but honestly I don't think it requires Josh's presence. He isn't the sole person capable of making jumping puzzles and also not the only artist who could make SAB assets. Although he was the most player-facing person on this project and probably its biggest lead and advocate for building on it, there were a bunch of other people building it with him.
---
I think the problem with building a world 3 would be that they made world 2 a pretty big skill increase over world 1, and if they want world 3 to be even more tough, that puts a lot more strain on design for something that is just a festival. Had they just decided to make it whatever they wanted and not care about whether it is harder or easier than world 2, they could probably pull it off.
---
Combat smoothness and QOL I'll give you but story is done much better in ESO and SWTOR.
---
I don't think stat nerfing groups of 25+ is a good solution at all.  What you want to do is balance the game so it's possible for a smaller group to beat a significantly bigger one by outplaying them.  Yes you can win outnumbered fights against lower-skilled players.  If they are at least decent though, it's next to impossible due to target caps.  10 target scourge shades used to be a way to punish groups, but I will admit they were imbalanced.  If more classes had access to skills with higher target caps, it might take some emphasis off the numbers factor.  
---
Until that changes, you're just going to run into the same problem, but on a smaller scale.  What I mean by that is you will see 24 person groups and not be able to fight them with 15 or whatever.
---
&gt; all we can do is try and boost their morale
---
My own morale regarding GW2 is at zero if not negative. Standalone devs aren't at fault here and they have my full support - as creative people who try their best, - yet, as a (recently) greedy, faceless company overall, Anet doesn't deserve any sympathy anymore.
---
Or try around the time of the metas - the influx of players should force new maps to be made.
---
Just for the lolz but  
---
Rotsono : it can't really get any worse  
---
Anet : hold my cat
---
the gender bs isn't scientific so yeah
---
Elite specs aren't equivalent to elite skills. The balance requirement would be through the roof. Even a team of a hundred people would require a lot of time to balance that. This is a terrible idea lol. Additional skills to the 6-9 skill slot would be ideal and probably easier to manage. What GW1 had is an enormous skill log that gave the game incredible variety. GW2 can have that too.
---
Kinda sad how cool the old box-art is.
---
GW2 is literally just the logo.
---
No. I meant the vines themselves.
---
Same here, was playing from beta, I haven't been back since that announcement. My attitude towards the game can be summarised thusly: if they don't care why should I? Now I understand that the devs personally care a lot, however the entity Anet does not give that impression anymore.
---
Nice and all, but i do want you to know the whole "we're here for you ANet, we got faith you can turn things around" has been done in the past and it's very clearly not working.
---
&gt; They have to have a central theme, they have to unlock a new meaningful weapon, and they have to be balanced so they don't invalidate old elite specs.
---
Because doing those things are so hard.
---
It's not like people have given advice on how to do this perfectly for years.
---
Yah tbh most pug groups a good warrior can still top dps. It was a fun few days to not be a mechanics bitch but all good things never last :c
---
It was supposed to be an overflwo map for WvW but they never implemented it as such. It became a PvD map for those that didn't want to pvp in WvW (go figure) and basically took away a large proportion of the WvW population. When pips were introduced with legendary armor in WvW EOTM didn't get them and players deserted the map. 
---
Its an example of how Anet completely fucks up solutions and creates new problems.
---
You're either a shill, or a naive sucker. You can keep singing them praise as much as you want, they still won't give a fuck about you. Maybe some random dev sees it but nobody who is actually in charge even thinks about the entire reddit as a factor, less alone a few people "supporting" them with facebook likes and reddit upvotes.
---
Yeah I know.
---
But a man can dream.
---
To be fair I think they already have a lot there with the Tengu so it's not like they would start from scratch but still its quite a challenge and Anet doesn't seem to have good work ethic, sadly
---
So many hopeless ppl in the comments. Ppl were saying the same shit before HoT and between HoT and PoF. All we need is another wavy expansion to breath some life back into the game.
---
Let's not forget that Naoki Yoshida \[the director\] has one of the best teams he could possibly have, a team willing to work DURING THEIR FREE TIME solely to keep players happy.
---
He also writes his own article on a magazine \[can't recall which one unfortunately\] and ACTUALLY POSTS ON THE FORUMS. He posts what ideas he has, what feedback he's seen, what they're thinking of doing and whether or not people like it or not, he even logs into the game from time to time just to have fun with the playerbase.
---
Him and his team are people that GIVE A SHIT ABOUT THE GAME.
---
I don't know. I am sort of interested, but not a fan of the setting. I think a lot of people are going to be put of by the survival elements, and clunky combat.
---
I have over 400kp - haven't ever seen a drop in my groups tbh, had to buy it myself. The drop chance is much lower than what people say.
---
Ok so to everyone, he somehow got it downloaded.
---
His girlfriend came home and figured it out in about 2 min lol idk what she did but he got it.
---
Thanks for the input everybody!!

Me, reading this and agreeing with it:
---
&gt; That's why I'm here to say to our friends at ArenaNet: We're here for you. Many of us might be unsatisfied right now, but those who are CAN be won over. It isn't too late to turn this glorious ship around.

[Also me, on the other monitor, at the same time.](https://abload.de/img/ffxiv_20122019_000406wlkmw.png) You miiight have to work a little harder winning me back, ANet. Sorry, just took entirely too long and I jumped ship and wow is this game addictive. :o

I have a dieting tip. See that chocolate bar? Brake it in half, now it is half as much calories, so you can have twice as much.
---

After having one legendary skin for each weapon type (half gen1, half gen2) I found everything meaningless. Any new weapon skin is useless because I will prefer the legendary ones (i tried to change some several times, but ending putting the original skin on, except on the hammer, I always used mjolnir on the gen1 hammer) . For armors I did the wvw misftforged legendary in heavy and all armor skins from S4 (the one witch gave the temporal tourist title). I was at the point where nothing interesting for me could come up. I only have one contract, the seller one, doesn't care of the hair change one, I never change hair of my characters because I fell it destroys the image I have of them. Really zero interest in infusions. No more goal ingame. I continued to play after that for some months, but ultimately stopped 1 or 2 months ago and won't reinstall. The "announcement" and mo leaving not for a big position somewhere else, but to create something from scratch with others from anet... all of that and no more ingame goal was the signal to prepare to jump out of the gw2 ship for me. Playing the saga prologue (and giving it a fair amount of time, not just QQing after the first day/week) was the jumping signal.  
---
6.6k hours on this game wasn't that bad though (half of it in WvW). The base game was awesome, with a lot of promesses for the future.
---
To add to that it, if they did make a world 3 it wouldn’t feel the same without Josh
---
if you want to look like a chad or a stacy.. in a fantasy game.. might as well also play a human race.
---
=D
---
Size is very important to me (please no puns). I feel like the lw maps are pretty cramped. I ahve a problem with the level design of lw maps in that there is no breathing room in between features. It starts to feel painfully aware that you are in a theme park not an actual world.
---
&gt; Now imagine having all legendaries
---
You know, in that case you really ought to do something else with your time because you're missing out on a lot of **amazing** video games by playing GW2 so much. &gt;.&lt;
---
You'right, its entirely subjective. But an denyable fact is that a very big chunk (id like to say a majority, but not sure about that) of all skins are from the gem store and it can be seen that more effort has been put into those than some of the ingame ones
---
No beast races at all?  Nothing but humans?  I'll pass.
---
To a point, but this has literally never been the case with any MMO of any real size.  Server maintenance and upkeep is expensive.  Not saying that games are handling it well, but they need steady reliable income which just absolutely can NOT be obtained simply by having a buy once and never pay anything again sales strategy.
---
Remember to use the official retailers, [&gt;&gt;list here&lt;&lt;](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers/), to prevent any complications when buying the game. ArenaNet cannot help you with unauthorized sellers and using fraudulent keys can lead to account being suspended.

Eh, this is classic "single person roaming thief enthusiast complains he has nobody to gank and kill out of stealth". I _like_ large WvW zergs. Otherwise I'd play regular PvP where you get exactly what you want -- small scale fights.
---
If you're extra skilled player then group up with other extra skilled players and kill the larger Zerg due to great communication and team play.
---
If you're a solo player then blob provides significant safety. Even if there's a debuff no way in hell I'd go "roaming". And no, I'm not interested in getting killed a few thousand extra times to learn how to survive a gank attack from two thieves duo-camping spawn, okay? Just no. 
---
As for commanders -- we already have situation where there are no open commander squads outside of prime time except for maybe one occasionally jumping maps. Nothing prevents people from tagging up, of course, but "debuffing" Zerg is not going to make extra bonus commanders appear out of nowhere.
---
Also also, what will happen when some random friendly players start to follow you? Are you going to scream at them to get out from the area cause the debuff is about to be applied? What if they stay?
---
&gt;what content would veteran players want to see?
---
You see how other MMOs deliver content that isn't finished in 2 hours at the most casual of paces?
---
And the example is: " *Dude, you've spent like* [***400***](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=400) *bucks on this game so you can beat everyone who hasn't spent* [***any money***](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=any%20money)*.* [***Pay-to-win***](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Pay-to-win) *noob!* "
---
you dont get one up on anyone or unbalance the game with the kind of rewards you get form the cash shop in gw2.
---
The real fuckup here is all the wasted man hours on "side projects*. They spent years trying to develop multiple games which never saw the light of day in any manner whatsoever. None of them got far along enough to show the public anything.
---
Mike Z has not worked at ArenaNet for two months.
---
bad
---
Do you have to log in on a character or just log in?
---
I understand, I was just hoping for a brighter future. But, as you say it's still huge, and it's not like Guild Wars has been shut down, so I doubt GW2 will be anytime soon.
---
I don't think new elite specs are even necessary. Just new weapons. Let us play with old niches and themes in new ways.
---
Although it's extremely unlikely that it will cost you that much, your post highlights how predatory RNG cash shop purchases are. They exist to obfuscate the true cost of an item and steal extra money people with addictive tendencies.
---
No one gives a shit about WVW players, stfu
---
Really looking forward to it.
---
Those are actually the two I play heavily, but I have done 95%+ of both and I was looking for something with a bit more sense of wonder/noob experience.
