Congrats, I wish more people had this mentality, contrary to popular belief most raids are easy (hell, Vg and Horse aren't even the easiest). It took me years to get into raising cause I got sold this ideia that they were super hard, when I got into them, round them super easy and enjoyable, bought a commander tag and started to organise my runs from there.
---
As a follow up, look into wing4, the first 3 bosses are pretty easy, the 4th (Deimos) can be a bit trickier for new players, but can also be cheesed easily with a ranged strategy where all the pressure is focused on 3 party members and the rest of the party can be nearly afk.
---
Vale guardian is a great raid to learn, keep running it, it has nice mechanics that aren't too elaborate but compliment each other well, and you'll notice similar mechanics to some extent on other bosses.
---
Good job mate.
---
---
---
You should be surprised at how common this is in EVERY IT services, hospital included. Enjoy =)
---
This game is just gem store updates.
---
They are literally not excluded since the other paths grant gifts as well. 
---

---
Any content that comes out of those gifts, and the means to acquire them, is thus accessible for those who do the other paths.
---
Even after 7 wings VG is still one of the hardest bosses. Gz.
---
In that alternate universe the game died cause there was no funding for any xpac. Bank tabs and character slots are not profitable enough.
---
Don't get me wrong, I agree that we should get more ingame rewards, even if recolors or reshades of existing itensbz
---
At this point i think if they could do it they probably would do it. It will break everything if they even touch the candy corn gobbler if you consider how old it is.
---
That ping doe!
---
What are the pants?
---
but i do have to look at them because other people buy them.
---
Sadly my level 69 guild that requires ‚Äú95%‚Äù rep kicked me for not repping on one of my characters.
---
Not gonna say who it was but DuDe was that lame.
---
Wait, the gingerbread is the hard one? I thought thats the easiest one?
---
Congrats! After playing off and on since release, starting to raid back in April of this year really turned gw2 into a whole new game for me. I hope you continue with it and have as much fun as I've had!
---
I was away from reddit for a couple of days but...mm does it have a high skill cap?  I also check a couple of videos of "viable" (dont quote me on this because I'm a noob anyways) ranger dps builds (in case I decide to go mesmer) but I'm more inclined for the Revenant + Guardian Combo.
---
Since my friend doesnt have the expansion I was thinking on something he could do tons of dps with a core build while I either support/tank or dps with any class as I do have both expansions.
---
Where we're going we don't need unit tests
---
Duelist
---
Is there a way to preview them ingame already?  
---
These look like *the weapon set* I've been hoping for to match Ad Infinitum!
---
That looks like a fucking mess.
---
finally they gonna work on something with a real engine and not a dead on Arrival one...
---
wont be for gw tho
---
&gt; So I've been afking in there for straight half an hour and nobody joined, making it impossible to me to complete the daily. 
---
You can solo it easily, but aside from that a few questions. 
---
Which entrace did you use? There are two, one for public instances and one for groups. 
---
If you joined a group instances, it's pretty clear why you were alone. 
---
If you joined a public instance, are you sure the instance weren't already done? 
---
You said you waited for half an hour afk. The events start automatically in public instances, so if you really waited half an hour and it wasn't a finished instance, toys would have killed the dolyaks within the first few minutes. 
---
I think you either joined a private instance (unlike public, private instance need 5 ppl to start) or you joined a finished public instance. 
---
Because even in the middle of the night like now I could find 3 different groups after joining public instances 3 times and they had 5, 5 and 4 players (including me ofc). So no problem to find ppl.
---
thats even more unlikely the MMO genre is dead in favor of bare bones mobile games which often makes more money which way less investment and maintaining cost
---
Nope.  Quaggan is easiest.  Snowman is middle difficulty.  Gingerbread is max difficult.  It's all easy though.
---
when mesmer was born,no balance was present. still 100% - 0% in 0,5 sec. (from invis ofc,dodge noob) 10/10
---
Hahaha I see what you did there mate üòâ

I really wish you all would stop with this dishonest and long ago debunked "argument".
---
Both classes can have depth to them, but their basics are quite simple. By playing through the story and open world you'll have time to learn them at your own pace and in a quite forgiving environment. Partying up makes content easier as well.
---
The basics when starting out is using gear of around your level, reading the skills and traits as you unlock them and then deciding how much dps or survivability you want when you choose weapons, utility skills and traits. If you want some guidelines for builds, metabattle has some tailored for open world, which include some explanations. If you have more especific questions, you can ask in the stickied weekly thread, or send me a private message here on reddit :)
---
Because gambling always makes a ton more money. Doesn't make for long lived games, however. Especially in the west.
---
400 gems..
---
lol i never attacked ppl out of nowhere. i made sure they all saw me being around and running to them before i used a predictable 3 sec torch stealth (never started a fight out of mass inv) and often, as you can see in this vid, i didnt even stealth before attacking at all. if ppl cant dodge such a well telegraphed burst with 3/4 casttime (without stealth) or an easy predictable oneshot out of 3 secs stealth when i show them that i am about to attack before stealthing then it has nothing to do with mesmer. im not playing a stealthspam pu build. i play full glass with 2 stealthskill can be punished and countered easy, esp when i give ppl the information that i am around before attacking, often the enemy even started the fight not me, so pls... 
---
and my mirage cant even oneshot at all without a single dmg multiplier. its an tactical interrupt build, but feel free to play my core or mirage build and upload some footage yourself to show me how ez it is, esp when played in high ranked pvp vs decent ppl or hardcounters like thiefs attacking me first or outnumbered. 
---
i would get your point if i would play a forgiving stealthspam pu build and attack on ppl without them knowing that i am near but that never happend in that vid. literally every class on meta build is way less balanced and way easier to play than any build in my vid.
---
GW themed battle royale game?
---
Unless they changed it in my time with the game (about 2 yearsish) you can see all ingame skins from a bank.
---
As far as i know it is not locked behind a entry level and for most of the content your gear does not matter.
---
I don't know how upscaling works in the snowman dungeon, but aside from that, you are able to do everything, even without lvl 80.
---
Boon stripping is easy peasy it‚Äôs not a problem
---
I must see it on a charr
---
Do you need a steady supply of snowflakes for it all year to get the 25% buff? That seems like a lot
---
The easy route's snowflakes also don't crumble I believe.
---
Cozy Wintersday Skyscale looks good but already have an Incarnate Flame Skyscale so that's a pass from me
---
People always ask for ArenaNet to get rid of zone boundaries but this will never happen.
---
The fact that they can spin up and down instances of individual maps is a consequence of the world design, and was almost definitely deliberate. It's what allows them to push several client updates in a single day without having even a second of downtime, and it allows them to better scale to demand in a single area, without having to shard the entire world.
---
This decision was one of the most brilliant parts of GW2's design, and it's worth the tradeoff of map boundaries.
---
They'll probably do it for at least those ones if there's enough complaining
---
Returning player here, trying to get back into the swing of things. How should i go about getting to the more current content? Is it recommended to play through the whole living story (at least what i have unlocked) or should I just go to the most recent episode and do the content there first? Feels like I've fallen way behind since the last time I played was around Path of Fire's release.
---
why should they all be the same if some of the routes are much easier than other routes? it defeats the purpose of having different routes at all.
---
I randomly lucked into that sword when it first came out on a free key, and I honestly never use it cause it doesn't look very good. The fire side isn't bad but the water side is pretty underwhelming.
---
garbage day!
---
It'd be very nice to at least not have to pay 3 times the price for them to select one skin to complete the set.
---
Hey. I commented earlier saying that I was super underwhelmed on thief. I have come around, since investing more time in build craft on daredevil and it's ludicrously powerful in openworld afterall. I honestly don't know if I was just dealing with lag or a bug that caused my damage to be so low, but it's crazy how strong it can be made. I could post my build if you're interested, but suffice to say that thief does have it's strengths
---
Something something thief is overpowered.
---
You can do everything except the Lair of the Snowmen mini raid. The tower defense minigame will scale you, the dungeon is so easy it doesnt matter, and the other 3 minigames do not require you to fight.
---
That means all the other cosmetics and such are available to you. Selling the presents even just for the first day my be a great idea to give you a boost in gold to gear out with when you do hit 80.
---
&gt; Make us new year gift &lt;3
---
Inb4. Lunar New Year has a gemstore item for consuming Luck this year.
---
But his player skills and rotations will probably be slow and defficient. Eating a lot of damage and not pulling off enough dps.
---
I could use a code! Please pm me :3
---
It's too volatile ATM. I could post 5k of them on the TP ATM at 7s each and never sell them
---
They all seem from same year though. Except last one because of new Black Lion cub icon.
---
Uh no it's cultural human t1
---
They would also have to give up part of game sales revenue. Epic takes about 5-10% of sale as payment for sourcing the UE engine for professional purposes. A game has to show the unreal engine logo on startup.
---
You can use the UE freely for personal/amateur work or if you dont plan on officially publishing something built on it.
---
That character looks like some kind of Kdrama ken doll.
---
Dunge... actually nvm
---
Yikes forever
---
As far as I'm concerned, any backpack that has a matching dyeable glider should be updated to match.
---
I'm getting The Grinch (Jim Carey) vibes from them and it really makes me want to cry. They look like they taste like peppermints
---
Legendary armor.
---
That was quick
---
Only have to worry about drop bears in Australia. They climb up in trees and wait for you to walk past. Everything else is pretty chill tho TBH.
---
How do I join Raid Academy?
---
Weird, the map I was looking at I just assumed was wrong cause the first one I tried wasn't right. Also mine has one that yours is missing too, in the middle.
---
Wow. When I heard the name I figured it'd be like the Rime-Rimmed Marriner's Rebreather and basically be the Verdant weapon skins, maybe tinted blue-white, with a frost effect on them.
---
Not... this.
---
WTF!?!? Why is Pharus one of the skins?
---
Congrats, go for Sabetha next, one of my favourite bosses in the whole game.
---
I think it's along the path, the marker is just missing for some reason. There's more than one in the Pavillion for sure. But thanks for pointing it out!
---
To be fair, the holographic precursors are rather nice.
---
And it wasn't the first either: Gifted weapons are basically other precursor or rare weapons "wrapped up".
---
Gemstore? No thanks. I already wasted too much time and money in this game. Then again, I'm not the target audience since I only play now for living story updates and the guild, and even then rarely these days.
---
Those are highly dependent on your account wardrobe. So they differ per user.
---
That's an awesome tip! I am nearing the end of the mat farm for my saddle :) I think that an important thing to note when farming these is that the renown hearts in each map will usually help out a lot too! I have 5 characters at max level, and in thunderhead peaks, i can run through all the hearts on all the characters in about 30-45 minutes.
---
This means that i get 20 currency/char, so I get 100 in a really short time. I found this really effective for Thunderhead Peaks, Jahai Bluffs(also one event farm on this map too), and Domain of Istan. I did the TaCO routes for the Domain of Kourna and that one took me by far the longest. I am about to start the Dragonfall one tomorrow, but I have a fair bit stockpiled. Hopefully renown hearts are something you can get to work! :)
---
were you in my W1 run earlier?(im silent shadow the daredevil that lead the run) if so congrats and i hope to see you more frequiently on the discord \^o\^
---
You need to complete the meta a few thousand times to get all the Scion weapons anyway, so no rush
---
If you have a lot of karma, you can exchange the new map currency from Bjora's March for the previous season with no daily cap.
---
I'm sorry, what?
---
Most likely it'll be from a bundle like Immortal and Onyx and Gold Lion weapon sets. That also means 2k gems each weapon.
---
Starscale
---
That's the equivalent to blizzard announcing diablo immortal being mobile.
---
With that bug you can stack the legendary auras to infinity 
---
With xiuquatl you'll spawn a ton of xiuquatl entities making everyone lag out at some point
---
Well, considering how we had to get the Branded skyscale, chances are pretty low.
---
They do crumble as well, just not as fast.
---
What the hell happened to your Primeval raptor?
---
They don't even look good. They're just a small bundle of infusion overload that you hold.
---
Holy shit, dude!
---
That name has already been claimed by the galaxy raptor.

Is that a pasta type?

I believe you also need volatile magic too which is bottlenecking a friend of mine who's played since launch.

Better Starscale
---
As far as I remember, it's only Karma + map currency for Bjora Marches. You need VM for the Dragonfall exchange, I think?
---
Hard route can be cleared faster than previously because you won't run into re-spawining snowflakes as you once would with the slower cycle. Maybe they didn't realize it last year when they set the rewards against what they want the max/average per minute to be. And due to the higher completion speed, they slightly adjusted the rewards.
---
thanks anime scrapper

---
&gt; While I know that this sounds ridiculous to all you mega players those mere mortals of us need to know simple things.
---
The only difference between a mega player and a mere mortal is typing "collection name guide" into google before starting.
---
I didn't even use them half a decade ago because of how low-poly and low-res they were.
---
Relog?
---
You can type /wiki NameOfItem into your chat and you will get the wiki page to the item you want informations on.
---
For currencies thats especially interesting, because the wiki will tell you where to get what.
---
Please use it.
---
If you have "DPI Scaling" checked on, turn it off and you should be able to make it smaller.
---
While your tip is a great one I get confused from time to time. I took your suggestion and typed in "GW2 Collection Name Guide" and was promptly overwhelmed. I have no idea how I would even find what I was looking for in the massive amount of information it gave.
---
I'll try that. I had no idea.
---
She will only appear in the instances of the characters who've finished the HoT story, i.e. whichever character you did that Caladbolg arc/collections with.
---
When it first came out "Festive Imbiber" had NO "consume all"..... imagine what when thru my mind when I saw how many "double clicks" I need to consume all the drinks....
---
relog doesnt work. had to wait til they killed the boss
---
Logged yesterday, used tik markers from 2 years ago, same locations..
---
Which one lol
---
That‚Äôs kinda sad but it also may not be that bad: the people there for that don‚Äôt get pulled in in the first place and the people who are into PvE enough to play anyway get more content there
---
It‚Äôs not hilarious, and your comment is completely oblivious to what people are actually protesting when they note how out of balance the gem store versus in-game reward ratio is.
---
We both know that's making a lot of assumptions about the love lives of Redditors.
---
Like I said, visual bug created by d912pxy
---
I use the Abbadon sword with my Mistward armor. It's hard to match the hue of the metal with that of the sword, but besides that, I find it to work very well. You could also try the Dominator sword or the Mordrem Saber. You'll have to spend quite some gold on the first two, though... 
---
There are a lot more things that can work well, especially if you dye the armor after the swords. These are just suggestions.
---
Good to mention would be, is that they‚Äôre exclusively NA. Their EU counterpart is [the Crossroads Inn ](https://discordapp.com/invite/nZg52r3?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf).

That's what makes them feel more realistic. Perfect symmetry is uncanny.
---
Wow i am getting downvoted because i said " thanks" i mean : i will just be able to play at weekend because work keeps me busy this week before christmas and it was nice to see someone posting this.. i dont mean to say " the skins look great... because they are reskins" but i wanted to say " thanks" to the person who posted this...
---

I'll give you an other tip: start hoarding ice brood saga currency now just in case.
---
It got changed back in 2015
---
Oh dont get me started. Red celestial especially is  one of the few auras that you can't just buy off TP, so it more or less requires you to dedicate yourself to the content (inb4 someone says it is possible for someone to buy 100CM runs 30-40 times to get it, thats not the same and you know it).
---
You would think having known about player requests to improve the resolution devs would have done something by now, especially since 100CM was released on 2017 and the players requested a change pretty much from the start. But no, releasing mount skins, an outfit and a backitem with better celestial effects and textures is the priority. Not to mention all of these skins are RNG, they gotta milk the money of impulsive and vulnerable players.
---
Yep, I think my biggest dissatisfaction with GW2 atm is that there's really nothing unique or interesting to create a sense of attachment to anything.
---
I tamed Humar the pridelord as a level 20 something NELF back in BC just for shits and giggles. It took a couple dozen deaths, a couple of marathons worth of running, and dodging a whole bunch of horde but stealing him from underneath an orcs nose was totally worth it. Even now a decade+ later, I still can remember crowing about it in vent. I have so many good memories of camping for rare spawns, joining specific groups for certain pets and skins, having to research evolutions, and generally enjoying the time that went into getting the exact pet that you needed, that it's really hard to not look at gw2's current system vs gw1's vs other mmorpg's and feel totally ripped off.
---
Last time Mini Frostbite was in gem store was back in 2017 August. Though Airship Pass is kinda obtainable through the RNG season 1 boxes, https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Lion_Commemorative_Sprocket 25 sprockets, but it could cost around 3k gems to get it like that.
---
One of these days, ANet will stop fucking with scrapper. Oh, who am I kidding?
---
Do the same thing you've always been doing these past 7 years?
---
Who the fuck wants P2W over cosmetics?
---
Raids are now in the game and there is a lot to gain from them if you're only starting now. Similarly, there's fractals which are quick dungeons tiered up to a considerable difficulty. 
---
I don't PvP, but there is a ton of world PvE for you to get into if you've been away. I'd start out with properly exploring Heart of Thorns during a time when the zones appear decently populated to you. 
---
The second expac, path of fire, is also worth getting for mounts and new elite specializations. 
---
Given time, you will catch up on absolutely everything. GW2 is not the kind of game to leave you behind. Season 1 is forever gone, though, you'll have to watch a recap on YouTube. 
---
You've likely missed out the periods when Season 3 and S4 episodes were free on login. You'll have to buy them with gems, but don't worry, they're worth it. 
---
Right now, content in general is slow, but particularly instanced PvE is suffering currently. They added a new feature (strike missions) but cancelled new fractals and raids for the foreseeable future. This is quite a bane on some of the veterans in the game, but you will have a lot to try before you get bored. Four years of content are not to be taken lightly. 
---
We don't know anything about a third expansion coming except that it's not out of the question. For now, we will be getting bi-monthly S5 episodes with maps/map segments and story. They offer some decent rewards, but Anet's policy of putting desirable cosmetics in the shop and way less desirable cosmetics into the game has been reaching new highs. That isn't nice either, but it's their only real source of revenue, so there is that. 
---
The game is very well populated overall, so you're not playing on a sinking ship. The waters are troubled, however, and the mood here has been reflecting this. Don't make too much out of it for now. Enjoy the amazing content there is, because no matter what, you'll be excited by a lot of it, and you should come to love or dislike the game for what you've experienced yourself, not just for the problems others tell you about.
---
You could bring him a stick with the .dat file to save time downloading. Hope it goes well. :)

shit ton of people in game. ironically, the more drama and talk is bringing people back.
---
think its the classicwow hype ending

Oh cool, I might just have to do that! Thanks for the help!
---
Going to see about that tomorrow also. Thanks!
---
Didn't think you could get over to that spot in the story instance..
---
There are many types of fields you can stand in or around without any issues. (Combo fields) These are unique to skills, and vary widely in appearance. The only ones you need to be worried about standing in are shapes with a red line border (usually circles) and solid orange shapes (also usually circles.)
---
The red border shapes are weaker persistent damage AoEs, but you can take big damage if you sit in them for awhile. They also tend to cause some type of condition, be it cripple, chill, poison bleeding, etc.
---
The solid orange shapes are burst damage from enemies. Usually there is a build up time, which allows you to get out of range or prepare a block/counter. Sometimes the only way to stop the damage is to break the enemy's defiance bar with crowd control. It depends on the enemy. Occassionally these attacks are powerful enough to down you with one shot, especially if you have a glass cannon build.
---
There are a few exceptions and outliers, but when you encounter those you will certainly remember them. An example would be the Mordrem snipers in Heart of Thorns, the first expansion. When they focus you, a giant red target shows up on your body. Their shots are a glaring orange line that stays on the ground that you will want to not stand in. Not exactly the same as either of the above, but if you stand in it once, you'll realize it's a bad idea!
---
I will warn you, with some bigger or more powerful enemies there isnt a ground indicator when they do burst damage. Their bodies will always indicate though, so pay close attention next time if you find your team struggling.
---
I hope that helped! Almost everything else is good to stand in, to get bonus combos like boons, extra damage, or auras.
---
Just start the download, stop it, go to the folder and paste the .dat file there, replacing the one the download created. Then start the launcher again, it should only take a minute to install then.
---
See you when you'll start Vision, with 3160 ore, 460 mass, 300 shards and 100 of others needed...
---
To match the outfit?
---
Compare these gemstore skins to skins we've got through gameplay. This could aswell be a themed legendary set, while we get skins like restored boreal skins which look pretty terrible. And this problem has been in game for years. I think it's understandable they load the gemstore with skins that look desirable as they have to make profit somehow, but in this content drough the game is currently going through they just feel like an another nail to the coffin.
---
Probably, but I mean they do have that glider right now.. but you know they are planning some day..
---
Looks like your average GW2 player to me
---
I believe secret lair of snowmen boosts you to 80 if you're not
---
it really wasnt.

The booster only stacks up to 2h15m. Could have mentioned that in the description, but hey it's Anet being Anet.

---
its not worthless, karma still has uses. depending what you do, you can buy obs shards with it instead of farming SW for it.
---
you can also forge karma using various karma armors, then salvage. surely thats a lot of clicking, but thats a helluva lot better than wasting your karma on the festive bags which gives you almost nothing. its a huge karma dump for no real profits, for a currency put to better uses elsewhere.
---
Hi, I didn't know that. But In any case I can promise you that I looked for her and I didn't see her. Im missing something?
---
Yeah, I did it on the original character but  there is no way, she doesn't want to appear. No \*\*\*\*ing idea what I am missing. Thanks for helping!
---
Yes, I did everything on the guide, I finished every step but In the end she is not on the Home Instance so I have no idea what I am missing. Can I send a ticket explaining this to the GW2 Official Support?
---
&gt; 6) WvW expects to get Alliance update also soon, but it is tied to swiss pvp update, so this soon might be in few months or a year, we don't have any new info about it.
---
So delusional. Year? It will not go live... ever.
---
You missed 1 at easter commons + 1 at ossan quarter
---
Yep. On the other hand (for whatever reason) there is a big chunk of the GW2 player community that seems to like it that way... or even demand it. This group feels entitled to have everything without any real effort. What you describe with that epic taming story requires serious effort and so the reward was much sweeter for it.
---
Similarly, I spent literally months hunting the time lost proto drake mount, which is an insanely rare spawn on an infuriating random timer, that moves around a pretty vast area. I even gave up out of frustration from never finding it, and again after one near miss. When I finally got that mount, it was one of the most satisfying things in any MMO. There was a correlation between the time invested and the satisfaction of ownership. 
---
I get that people in GW2 are a little allergic to grind, but that comes with a cost.
---
All it would take for me to jump aboard GW3 is better graphics that don't cause my better than average computer to struggle to put out 90+ fps on max settings when afk in a dormant area. That said, it would take a lot more for me to leave GW2.
---
How do you know it's console-based?
---
Will you please at least wait till I'm in Hell, Satan?
---
I would rather get obsidian and craft something with it. Jeweled Damask Patch is great for useless mats for instance.
---
And we revisit the game for a week and then realize that it didn't address the core problems with the direction of the game.
---
Are they still active?
---
wanna bet?
---
I went on a black lion key spree a couple of weeks back and I have a fucktonne of BL skins unlocked.
---
Truth be told I'd rather use an 'uglier' skin compared to most pay-to-skin items. Walking arund boasting items that are 100% acquired with real cash feels dirty.
---
The dude I replied to edited his post. He literally said "in an alternative universe they would have the majority of skins as in game rewards and the gemstore would consist of things like bag slots/character slots/bank tabs". That's not reasonable.
---
I fully agree we should get more ingame rewards of an equal or higher quality than the gemstore (cosmetics are debatable but whatever). I'll even take an example where I think they did well, the requiem armor. In-game, not so easily obtained, looks good and detailed.
---
All I'm saying is that there should be a balance between in-game and gemstore items (there isn't at the moment, most good looking skins are gemstore), if they made in-game rewards a lot better than gemstore people wouldn't buy. So, yeah, balance. But gemstore cosmetics should be a thing.
---
As a note I say this, i wish they would have a clear separation, armor and weapons skins in-game, and keep the glider/mounts/outfits as gemstore. Having this clear separation would eliminate the comparison between quality of gemstore vs in-game rewards of specific item types.
---
Tldr: I agree with you, balance is key, but the dude I replied was saying something else entirely, a gemstore of barely no cosmetics and mostly populated with non-scalable options like character slots/bank tabs. That wouldn't work.
---
They fix the droprate of dungeon recipes sooner than the alliance system went public.
---
What else apart from GS 4 has an animation lock? I played DH,condi and heal FB, haven't noticed any other.
---
It would be unfair, to you :-)
---
Gotta please the Skritt hordes
---
it's less about overall boons and more about getting that aegis/stability at a crucial moment along with fast cc phases
---
thanks for the tips but i know how to play reaper, not sure what made you think otherwise!
---
that being said, in fractals it's probably better to adjust the rotation around shroud cd and try to squeeze nightfall/WoS inside it! waiting for stuff to line up to reset the rotation is terrible because the boss will be phased meanwhile
---
it's the capes and festivals that brought some open world players back.
---
How about Bill Cosby? Wait... oof nevermind.
---
lol yes, the huge responsibility of having 3s to react to a super telegraphed, side-steppable thing that doesn't even kill you most of the time and your death is unlikely to induce a wipe anyway
---
i'm wondering though, which boss do you consider as "just doing dps", since you place such value on like the easiest raid mechanic?
---
&gt; small change this year that may have changed.
---
They reduced rewards for the hard (left) track from 15 to 12, so a 20% nerf for rewards from gifts.
---
Don't forget that the Renown Heart vendors sell the currency of the map you're in, per 5, when you complete their quests. This is repeatable between alts, and resets daily, for a quick little boost. 
---
Good luck, pal!
---
I'd say the middle one is probably actually easier as long as you're relatively quick about it. The quaggan one has a couple of easy-to-misjudge jumps whereas the snowman one is pretty straightforward.
---
How did you get the previews without chat codes?
---
CAW
---
Any Australians wanna play together? im new!
---
This is the worst showcase I ever saw.
---
Downvoted
---
Meanwhile as a weaver I‚Äôve been desperately holding on statuettes specifically for that sword‚Äôs return for years lol.
---
my point is,that pvp comunity is like 200 ppl and wvw have last 5 roamers... so i dont know whos your targeted audience.
---
&gt; lol yes, the huge responsibility of having 3s to react to a super telegraphed, side-steppable thing 
---
I literally don't see it unless I consciously check the edges of the screen. I'm quite good at I mentally filtering out background noise... including visual noise, apparently. The teleports in VG are the hardest part for me!
---
People would be surprised if they saw the codebase behingld most commercial software. *laughs in emissions tests*
---
I hadn't thought about using my alts. You and another person suggested that. I think I'll do that.
---
It's still a grind. This isn't the only way I'm getting the materials I need, but if I had known I'd be further along.
---
imagine a company that cannot make a 3rd set of legendaries because it is so much work and then putting these weapons in... 
---
Guess this game literally doesn't want to please anyone anymore, instead just milking the audience until it dies
---
My juggernaut chrome armor lasts forever now even if i change to a different legendary. not that i am complaining.
---
They won't put all the stuff in the gemstore at the same time, rotating items throughout the duration of the festival will make players spend more.
---
Thank you very much for making this video! I wasn't sure what it did, or if it was even worth buying. I'm definitely buying that now.
---
 I'd appreciate one if you can \^\^
---
it says access denied when i click the link. can i buy these somewhere that is not gamestop?
---
Been since the patch before.
---
just two words:
---
thank you!!!
---
&gt; but Anet's policy of putting desirable cosmetics in the shop and way less desirable cosmetics into the game has been reaching new highs
---
Has it? I've found the rewards from LS episodes to be on par with what we've been getting during LS4. Prologue gave us a fair few of strike mission rewards (Ebon shoulder, Charr helm, chair), some new weapon skins (including a micro) and a nice t-shirt...
---
First episode gave us (underwhelming but still) two weapon sets, a new scepter, a new helm, a new backpack...
---
Halloween gave us a new helm, now we just got a brand new armor chest piece...
---
Let's not forget that in May of this year we were getting two new armor sets and a brand new mount with LS4-E6.
---
I don't know... On one hand I agree that Anet is being extremely agressive with their gemstore, moreso with the dyable backpack recently, but I wouldn't say it reaching "new highs".
---
Do this stack with the candy corn gobbler wvw and pvp buffs?
---
He means a new raid wing
---
Oh, it'll be a reward all right ... *for money*.
---
&gt; Buying HOT doesn't get you PoF
---
Unless you buy it in physical format in a store I don't think it's possible anymore to buy HoT, can we? At least on GW2's website trying to purchase HoT just leads you to the combo PoF+HoT purchase page.
---
No more..  "ah fuck my guild hall boost wore off, and I can't leave WvW cuz there's a fucking queue &gt;_&lt; "
---
Maybe in the next 3-4 months, they'll have the backpack on there too :D
---
I mean that's on you tho?   
---
You "got overwhelmed" and decided not to watch a 10min video on it and similar easy to follow resources... and then you make a "wish I knew thread". Your wish could have been granted very very easily my amigo. Hardcore vets and casual mortals alike do this same thing.
---
I just hit no to run repair.. closed client and reopened.. didn't get it anymore.   Didn't repair.  I think either one would work.
---
I just hear it as generic background noise, if I'm honest. I'm a bit over raiding if I'm honest, but I'll try to listen for it next time.
---
Well if the change currently in game is working perfectly, then it would be ready now.  The only way it isn't ready is if the buff actually disappears after 24 hours.
---
With how things are going, i wouldn't spend any money on the game.
---
Happened to me too. I had to abandon the character for a few hours and then eventually the checkpoint button worked. Definitely an unintended issue.
---
Nice video, i am glad you put the Greatsaw away :P
---
Can you use the gobbler in wvw itself? The candycorn one does not, or does it?
---
A while back there was adss for a different position requiring shipped titles on console. Think it was a technical artist position, maybe even programmer, can't really be sure.
---
There are a few skins you can not see in the wardrobe. The wiki has a page dedicated to that few armour pieces.
---
There's an option called effect LOD that you can toggle to reduce visual noise.  That's the only way some of my friends are able to see it consistently. Good luck,  keep trucking!
---
That seems intentional so that's reassuring.
---
And this is why you don't buy keys!
---
wvw, buy this your server becomes number 1 and then wvw servers shut down to immortilze it ofc
---
Ok. What MMO are not p2w, casinos, require player interactions and have expansions at least every year?
---
Like there is Warframe and Path of Exile. But they are not MMOs.
---
They have a rare chance of drop, but only one chance per day
---
eso, ff14 theres also corepunk and new world which are comming out relatively soon along with a mtg mmo and a lotr one.
---
Fuck, wish I had a bolt to do this with lol
---
Thank you for this excellent resource!
---
My gf had the same issue using the installer from the GW2 site, the workaround we found was to copy my GW2 installation folder on her computer. Not sure if you could apply this in your case.
---
That's definitely a marathon - it's more work than some of the legendary gear. If you're on EU, have Path of Fire and want a hand unlocking your raptor mount, let me know
---
Well, for the first days just have fun and do your dailies. Then, the most funny part, is to do the achies. If you want to be an employee both at work and at home, then you can spend all your free time farming the JP, but you will lose most of the fun.
---
Is this FFXIV?
---
Good idea gonna try later
---
Wardrobe unlocks can really boost your account value pretty well, some skins worth a lot. Just make sure you get all possible low skins first so you have a better chance for a good one.
---
sadman when heavy armors don‚Äôt have ‚Äúcasual‚Äù pants.
---
I mentioned the "C-word", even though most can't even define what it means. :p
---
Well when you put it like that..
---
I‚Äôll just enjoy messing about and making some cash on the side lol.
---
Cheers mate.
---
They are hiring someone to write out achievement guides.
---
Looking good, thanks for this. Minor correction though, winter's presence is a skin, winter's heart is the infusion.
---
Let me be a festive dragon with tinsel wrapped around mah belly. :p
---
I love being a vet, that dabbles in all parts of the game. I just have a shit ton of most stuff lying around.
---
Top tip. Next time you do a collection (including legendary weapon) check the wiki for timegated items. Or items behind old deserted events so you can get them.whilst they are hot.
---
So why is supposedly your subjective opinion more improtand or valid than games boasting millions of active users and more total acounts made that are also releasing new and more plentiful content?
---
One of the main drives was probably that theirs pretty much no other major mmo out there made or being produced for years now, so it isnt that bad idea if you can snatch an opportunity like that, of having the genra almost for yourself like WoW once had, amazon can certainly afford the risk involved without losing so much.
---
There aren't really many other companies who could justify going for this risk outside of the likes of Google etc.
---
Dont get me wrong im glad we finally get some who is still willing to invest in this genre, put dont get your hopes up other will jump in aswell if there aren't as big as amazon. Esp. if amazon mmo does well and they are already taken their piece of the pie.
---
I actually like these because they don‚Äôt have the typical ugly funko blockheads. They just look like cutesy figurines
---
Been doing it daily since release. Only ever seen two.
---
It should work with snowflakes in the bank. It's just a portable vendor, and vendors have been updated a while back to work with the material storage.
---
Sadly there are enough players that are mad about content that you have to achieve through gameplay. :/ They want to buy legendaries and hate to get the masteries for doing things like nevermore :/
---
Done it every day since release on 6 accounts and have gotten like 12 ebon chests and 0 chairs
---
I can also use it with my snowfakes in the bank, it seemes like a normal vendor
---
This. Have to skip, can't take this serious
---
Just finished, only problem I had was the "x amount of money per month" questions, as I do not regularly buy loot boxes, but have in the past. 
---
I understand this survey is more geared twords people with gambling and/or gaming addictions, those questions were just hard to answer.
---
Fun fact. If you stand in two blues at the same time aegis wont help you.  
---
But you probably knew that already
---
They will only drop from the daily wiggly chests, not from the boss loot. So doing it 50 times over a few days will be pointless when you can only get it from the daily chests. 
---
I got a drop a few days ago, so they're definitely still there :)
---
I will take one if you still have it please and Thank you :)
---
Holy trinity is bad . It is still here for high end content .
---
It is not tank healer dps
---
But
---
Alacrity healing dps 
---
So if u want in high level fractals you can still heal
---
oh god please make this a thing, if someone's in my party with a bunch of buffs their party click box extends all the way into the middle of my screen
---
Signed with Google ...sure
---
Congrats! We're happy to have you on RA. :)
---
Thanks for the summary but I'm not in the loop enough to know what alacrigade indicates as a profession.
---
 Is there somewhere that breaks down all the common nicknames for various specs to help out newbies?
---
Can u name all those new mmo? Since I cannot see them
---
basically, if you spend no money on these features during an average month, then you type 0
---
Thank you very much!
---
That's what I ended up doing.
---
Got one yesterday
---
Did you try to refresh the page?
---
New world, Magic legends, crimson desert, a new shooter mmo from the same studio, corepunk, a new lotr mmo in the works 
---
And in the space of existing or old mmos, a wow expnasion an eso exoansion, a engine upgrade for lineage 2 in ue4 from ue2.5 and blade and soul from ue3 to ue4.
---
Wish they would change candy corn this way. üëç
---
I assumed that only impacted distant effects, rather than screen ones. Cheers
---
It so wrong suggestion in many ways. Getting into raids arent easy. Even tho you can clear raids with exotic. It is hard to get in groups without li or kp.
---
Its really sad that when a request by one player gets shut down by another player because the change requested would not translate directly to cash for Anet. Its really sad that we just internalized this mentality that before we even suggest a change for discussion we need to consider whether Anet can make a profit off of it.
---
I got so tired I look up and learned how to macro it and got it done faster
---
reddit is known for downvoting any pvp/wvw content,so i know if you effort is placed in right place.
---
Good for you.
---
This one is next to Darkrime Delves, they added another one near the Raven Sanctum a while ago.
---
Just give me an option to disable them. Just poke me with pink icon when my buff is gone. Thank you very much.
---
Yeah, until marked person is one of those newbies and you get the bomb mechanics, and then he moves away from boss you don't kill add in time and its gg. Or like, those newbies don't know how to do dps boss properly and don't dodge important aoes .. or worse, they hit the ball during orb phase while attacking the add (yeah this happens). Or one of the chronos/druids gets marked and you have to switch position with them during split phase to burn the add. Or even simpler, they do shit dps, force you go to through multiple burn phases or get the 5 orbs, and because they do shit dps, the adds don't get killed in time ..
---
Bring 3-4 people, even if they are dps, who don't know what to do at KC and its at best a 50% chance of wiping.
---
And it's not like anyone will ever care what boosters the other party members have
---
Not that one specifically, but they've been popping up all over in the last few weeks. Something's brewing.
---
Are there more than 30? Since it says the most popular ones?
---
* Separate consumables and bonuses from boon+conditions+trait effects into own widget-tray of icons, which would have toggle setting on/off - depending on your needs, and would be a movable (same way the buff bar works in Lineage 2 - if anyone seen how it works there) 
---
* And/or add separate section for Hero panel which would keep consumables and bonuses status (bit like Wallet 1.0) along with armory-like account wide storage for consumables (food, utilities, banners, vendor purchasable summons) - just without any sort of "slots".
---
* The UX/UI hell approach: add remaining duration of consumables on icon of these within Inventory, just like skill icons have CD on skill bar.
---
Great help, thanks!
---
I know. But I doupt my sample will ever get too big for me to do that manually.
---
Wild guess here: all "buffs" are created equal and cannot be moved separately :D
---
Meanwhile I'm moving my minimap every 5 minutes to see if we're still outnumbered.
---
I got out by changing map layer in bottom right corner and it showed me normal tyria map, then i just used some random waypoint. Try that!
---
Also don't forget, when in WvW you won't be able to see if the enemy has a reflect/invincibility unless you hit him, since you need 5s to search for said icon. Until then it's over anyway. Unless it's a 1on1 and you can actually see the skills effect
---
I posted about one here a bit ago as well: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/e7a5xw/new_icebrood_statue_in_bjora_marches_has_anything/
---
Some people speculated that they phase in for you after you've completed the story which sounds right, but I don't think I noticed these other ones either.
---
It's almost as if both researched and use the aesthetics of north African Mediterranean culture.
---
They should just replace all lesser banners with heroes banners and fuse all the banner buffs into a single buff like the Spirit Banner. That alone solves over one third of the buff bar problem right there without them having to split the UI or do heavy lifting.
---
That'd be a great QOL update! I've been using the option to show simple party UI when I play Fractals... because on 100CM, when you juggle the ball, you can't target the floor behind some buff icons. However funny it is; "I wiped the team because Jimmy here has too many buffs." is an awkward thing to explain to pugs.
---
I would love one for my wife!
---
"do I have bloodlust? Let me move minimap in combat, oops I'm dead"
---
This reminded me of the show red vs blue. I gotta watch that again lol.
---
&gt; even on a 16:9
---
Did you mean 21:9 or higher because 16:9 is bog standard.
---
I find Funkos really annoying, but that bigheaded doofus Joko one is pretty great.
---
1000% yes! I finally gave in and switched my minimap to the top again because of this. I always run tons of boosts in WvW and it gets so hard to see what's happening.
---
Non-combat effects really need to be split somehow.
---
Great job! What else did you achieve as of late? Did you manage to go potty on your own? Did you finally clear your first fotm 50? Or maybe you finally achieved the prestigious title of Been there Done that?
---
You have my Axe! 
---
Newly crafted astralaria. It took me two months and then i mispent all my leyline crystals and i couldnt go kill cairn because of that). Anyway, this is a photo of a screenshot!
---
Suggesting that playing the game versus swiping a credit card is the same is also simply bullshit.
---
A WvW player who still has hopes and dreams? Now I really have seen it all.
---
do you wanna tell me that Gods of Egypt is a knockoff of ancient egypt? whats the next thing copyrighted blue sky?
---
I hope you guys get this patch soon.
---
We got this over in FFXIV last expansion I think, it made a huge difference.
---
joking right? it cost 150 gold..  
---
do you even know what is p2w?
---
Ah I just meant the tips for anyone looking at this thread, given the topic of the post XD
---
And yeah, that's the best thing that can be done. But if everything is on cooldown, your shroud got broken or something, really if everything just went to hell with your rotation due to some reason, the GS auto chain is perfectly fine to stick to until things are ok to use again. The biggest thing for reaper dps is having nightfall and well of power down, and then immediately going into shroud and using soul spiral. Thats pretty much reaper's burst.
---
And yeah, you generally only get stuck in axe if your shroud gets broken.
---
u/khorren mate, look, a low-effort thread that you missed somehow.  
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules#wiki\_low\_effort\_posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules#wiki_low_effort_posts)
---
Reminds me of the Vinewrath vines.
---
Didn't try but I guess wp are disabled while group is in fight. I just never ever go public strike missions again and problem solved. Better invest 2 min in opening LFG and wait for ppl than going public and losing 5 to 10 mins cause of bad players. At least for me, random LFG squads performed way better than random publics
---
Hopefully a game like GW2 could still succeed today on merit despite a subscription fee. And if not, that suggests that this sort of low-value/high-margin "live service" setup is the only way for a game like this succeed. And that's a lot more depressing than whether there are capes in the game obtainable through gameplay.
---
Plus, I'm not completely convinced that anyone who picked up GW2 primarily because it's free to play are the same people funding the game with $30 mount skins.
---
I'm always put off by the idea of having to methodically and mechanically follow a rotation, and having to use voice chat (especially because I can only play at night with people at home, and English isn't my first language). What was your experience in those aspects?
---
At this point, what is there to do marketing for other than the gemstore?
---
Thanks all, finally got back to game, hit 80, story continued!
---
Because he likes it white
---
Definitely - I find having the camera angled above is pretty helpful too for not overshooting jumps, which is very possible.
---
Yes please! I sometimes mount up to reduce the number of icons, but that's not available everywhere, and sometimes not even enough anyway üòÇ
---
There are some details about it, deff not a cooking simulator, tho i dont get what exactly is wrong with isometric and its quality, the environments are detailed, the game is detailed and polished and the artstyle is likely gonna be timeless? Are we being subjective here or is there objectively a reason that the game is inferior? Lest not forget osrs looks like a game from the 90s and its one of the more popular mmos rn.
---
I personally hope for a nice beer.
---
I did an orphan run yesterday, and all 30 seems to be where they were last year O.o
---
Is winersday okay to lvl up or nowhere near mad king lab?
---
What about a set place for each condition too so you can easily see what's on you and a number to show you the order of removal if you have any?
---
After playing first part of bjora marches and this so called saga, I'm not excited about anything anymore.
---
Gods of egypt is an amazing trash movie and i love it.
---
I actually got hit once by Gore's egg and I only noticed because my skill bar changed for a split second. Other than that, I felt like we didn't really have to dodge anything. I may not be the most experienced raider, but those blue teleport circles are a bit hard to see with all the visual clutter on the ground. Not to mention they stack when your group is stacked so you had better have enough endurance to roll, because you aren't *walking* out of that area.
---
25 percent of the original value, which I think is 195.
---
I have the celebration boost, gobbler{which shares a spot with the regular xp boost), amulet upgrade, and guild track, which if I'm not missing something puts me at a tick of 341. This boost brings me to 390, the same spot that the black lion boost would bring me.
---
Seriously thank you for this so much. I have specific characters for gathering, wvw, crafting and this helps so much
---
Nono I‚Äôm saying in a theoretical third game without that stuff entirely, those people wouldn‚Äôt be pulled in just to see it not get enough attention
---
That's something I didn't know, awesome.
---
Thanks. I'll keep that im mind!
---
Yes, and thank you very much for reorganizing us. I appreciate the original raid lead as well, but I felt a lot more confident when you stepped in and reorganized us. So that you to both of you.
---
I played all night yesterday doing the Christmas events like toypocalypse but I don‚Äôt recall getting a lot of xp or leveling even once. I‚Äôm level 25 on this character.
---
Did Arenanet ever say something about the Shrine Guardian Ears? I've never seen it come back after their release in JUNE
---
I always study encounters before I do them. Been doing that since my WoW days. If I'm not in the raid, I'm studying it. I started by dedication to attempting raids two weeks ago, so yes that meant studying until I finally entered.
---
Life sure is depressing.
---
Because they still like the game and they just aren‚Äôt excited/were disappointed about the first episode?
---
I'd buy an old LA pass as long as the population cap was relatively low in them (50 people or so)

ah yes nov 19. I must have not been fighting firebrands/guardians

Dunno, it's easier for me to memorise them by segments of city than remembering a whole long route ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ

Both are pretty generic designs. There's like couple hundred similar designs in entertainment before them. This is basically capeshit we are talking about.
---
If you have max lvl character already you can just exchange Spirit Shards for Tomes of Knowledge for free levels. (+ Birthday level scrolls)

Btw in open world dynamic events give a lot more exp than just map completion.

Bought it yesterday for pvp dungeon skin farming üòé
---
Should I really explain u why a full 3d environment is better than an isometric one for world exploration and immersion ?
---
The buff bar is one of the few things that are actually ugly in this game. I'd love the option to move it or disable certain buffs from showing.
---
 Hey bro, can you hit me up with 2 for me and a friend. We were talking about this a couple days ago, but we are from Portugal
---
fun factoid for you: there are 186 mount skins in the game.  8 of them are the base mount skins you get when you unlock the mount and the other 178 are the skins.  Know how many you can earn in game?  Zero...yep...ZERO
---
Mum, I want that Cape!
---
We got cape at home. 
---
Cape at home - *guild cape*
---
Yeah. 
---
But it's not always there. There are others around too. When I was doing the meta or map completion sometimes it was there, sometimes not.
---
But they aren't always there and I'm not sure why.
---
We used to get one map every 4 months, now after two months we get half a map and propably after another two months the other half.
---
Is this really the first case where the Female attorney dies?
---
People want to pretend there aren't a lot of earnable rewards in GW2; but, the reality is there's actually a ridiculous amount of earnable rewards in GW2.
---
Will we, as players, appreciate even more? Sure...but, to pretend like gw2 doesn't have a plethora of earnable rewards is being willfully ignorant. In fact, one can argue that every single "stuff" is earnable in GW2, because you can acquire every single "stuff" by simply playing the game and not spending a dime past the purchase of the game.
---
If you craft everything yourself, yes, but the finished items are tradable so you can buy them from the TP or ask friends/guildmates with a charged quartz stockpile to help you out.
---
You can't buy them directly, but if you have patience and a bit of money, you can get them a few other ways:
---
* Wintersday Gifts 
---
* Trick or Treat Bags
---
* Mining Quartz Nodes (rare chance to drop a charged crystal)
---
There may be other ways to acquire them as well, but these can help to offset some of the time with a bit of luck.
---
You can buy the treats themselves on the tp, or open lots of winters day gifts (they have a chance to drop charged quartz crystals as well)
---
God can I identify with this. It's such a dissapointing feeling on both sides. They don't get a cool new challenge and you lose the chance to actually have some rad interaction helping a person who loves the same shit you love. Too real man, too real.
---
My expectation was that we'd be getting one PoF-sized map over two episodes instead of two LW-sized maps, and that by doing this they could release faster by reducing the overhead of creating a new zone every time.
---
But it looks based on the datamined map boundary that Bjora Marches is just going to be roughly LW-sized after it expands. Hope they prove me wrong on all counts, or they're parlaying some of their efforts into an expansion.
---
&gt;Makes a Reddit post bitching about the gem store

&gt;Bought the newest available item on the gemstore on patch day
---
"WTF ANET WHY DO YOU KEEP UPDATING THE GEMSTORE"
---
Well they kinda did at some point according to [Mo](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5svug8/the_head_of_the_snake_devs_here_ask_us_anything/ddi8jxe/)
---
&gt; With S2 and S3 we've established that different zones take place at different moments in history. With that we have a lot of ability to take the world through dramatic changes without having to remove content from the game to do it. Who knows, everything is fair game, but I'll say that we're enjoying how much headroom we have to tell epic story within new content.
---
I see. Glad I haven't been missing any :)
---
[I bought it with gold.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/330/819/e47.png)
---
Same here, or just use it for the LW1 lobby if they ever bring it back.
---
It would be great as a guild hall too.
---
Only the home instance quartz node can drop Charged Quartz (or 5 bonus Quartz)
---
All of the open world nodes only give 1 quartz per hit, no bonus.
---
I dunno. While PoF development did begin around the same time of Gods of Egypt's release, there's several reasons to doubt heavy inspiration.
---
* Path of Fire is very clearly heavily inspired by Nightfall - it's basically to Nightfall as The Force Awakens is to A New Hope.
---
* The Underworld scene came from the devs going "hey, wouldn't it be cool if we actually killed the player?" and the look of the Underworld was created in GW1. It's design is very heavily similar to the Forgotten Vale in GW1 (but with modern graphical capabilities), so I'd mark that as the inspiration.
---
* Similarly, the look of Joko's and Vabbian architecture was created in GW1, having very heavy Egyptian and Persian influences respectively, so consistency would dictate Path of Fire would have Egyptian and Persian influences since the Desolation and Vabbi were the primary locations to visit.
---
* All relations to fires and forges is pretty much a given once Balthazar was decided. And there's only so many ways to design a giant forge.
---
I could easily see the argument that promotional shot of Balthazar and Kralkatorrik, and the teaser trailer from S3E6, as being inspired by Gods of Egypt. And maybe a bit here and there. But I wouldn't say "heavily inspired" by the movie so much as both the game and movie drawing from the same base inspiration (ancient Egypt).
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
And think of all the scenes NOT listed by OP. Kesho, Glint's Lair, the dwarven ruins, the Vabbian frozen palace, the sulfur mines, Garden of Sebhorin. Or the scrapped ruined Hall of Heroes. Are there equivalents in the movie to *anything* beyond the five above?
---
Should be a mouse over expanding box.  
---
It appears as a single buff, either a unique one to show there are many buffs, or as the first one on the bar. When you hover your mouse over it, it expands to show all of them like a drop down box, except horizontally.
---
Earn the gold convert the gold to gems and then get the complete pack.
---
Beautiful work :)
---
When I was doing Skyscale, my rotation was to take my main to DF, buy everything EXCEPT KRALKATITE from the vendor you found.
---
The exception is because while the other currencies can only be bought 5/heart, kralkatite is 25/heart.
---
So you take 4 characters to Istan, have 3 of them do all 3 hearts, and the last one do one, and you're *done* with Istan.
---
After a while you'll get used to the hearts, and honestly, grinding out that currency helped me learn a few of my alts a lot better (Alacrigade, Condi Scourge, condi FB..) just from fighting lots of random enemies.
---
Also be sure to break off of hearts to do at least a little bit of any nearby dynamic events too.
---
For my own sanity, it helped me to break it down I'm terms of "hearts remaining". 250/5 = 50 hearts needed in each map, with the dragonfall vendor serving as one free heart per day.
---
Just keep plugging away at it and before you know it you'll be well on your way.
---
how does anet not profit from it? the gems you buy with gold have been payed for with real money by someone else.
---
tell me again how many cool mount skins I can earn in game...oh right, the answer is none.  How many can you buy through the gemstore?  Oh, it's almost 200.
---
no? If your assumption was true, that would mean its entirely possible to buy out the entire systems worth of gems with gold, crashing the entire economy. That would be insane.
---
Each of the maps will reward 25 of there specific currency for completing it, per character, in addition to the normal farming methods.  Make sure you complete the maps on all your characters.
---
And not a bad chance at that. I've gotten three out of about 200 gifts.
---
As long as you can buy stuff from TP - there is no timegate.
---
Wait Jan 7th.
---
Of course, the classic gold-&gt;gems argument.  That's not earning anything.  You grinding gold for 10 hours to get a mount skin or me swiping my credit card is no different.  Doing a difficult boss or completing an achievement/collection is completely different.
---
GW2 has this problem though where nearly everything in the game can just be bought with gold.
---
Speaking of bags, I don't suppose we can make all 24/28 slot bags account bound, or add options to trade them in for account bound versions please?  &gt;.&gt;
---
The 24/28 slot ones from Bjora Marches are account bound, but not the ones from any other sources.  It makes it a real pain to try crafting them since you basically can't share them to characters other than the crafter until they're complete since your crafter can't upgrade them since they can't use items soulbound to another character as crafting materials.
---
try both builds (mirage, core, chrono is dead) yourself, you have disadvantage vs most build  in the game (and vs all metabuilds) with them. less active and passive sustain, less overall dmg, higher skill ceiling etc. hf! dont forget to upload your game play, im always eager to learn!
---
&gt; some money
---
Biggest understatement of the year
---
&gt; Stuff earnable ingame looks bland at best.
---
Yea, [they're](https://i.imgur.com/2YHzgwy.jpg) [all](https://i.imgur.com/JawZk1A.jpg) [very](https://i.imgur.com/pn1EP6D.jpg) [bland](https://i.imgur.com/8b4qRk7.jpg).
---
1: indeed similar
---
2: getting mad over the fact that libraries store stuff
---
3. that's more forced than me actually trying in raids
---
4. not even similar other than fire stuff
---
5. a generic take of "dude fighting flying thing" you'll find in 2864127 movies
---
Like 90% of players are running around with at least a couple of shop items not even including mount skins.   
---
Where you got the idea that there's a LOT of people saying gem stuff looks ugly is beyond me, I should know I'm one of them and we've always been few.   
---
Also yh there is OBJECTIVELY better cosmetics by quality of literally everything from model to particles all the way to style choices.   
---
You can meme all you want, thankfully your apologist opinion is in the minority.
---
I guess earning gold or $ isn‚Äôt earning anything. And I already said that there wasn‚Äôt a collection for skins in my original post 
---
That doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt ‚Äúearn it‚Äù
---
And I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs too many things you can just get with gold. Most of the prestigious things are via collection.
---
No they haven't. What is this WoW tokens?
---
I think you failed to comprehend what I said in my response.
---
Reminds me of a screenshot I captured [a long, long time ago.](https://i.imgur.com/U6JZXMj.jpg)
---
I was running around with the Royal Ascalonian Greatsword, you know the one that changes appearance depending whether it's day or night. I got some whispers every now and then asking what that weapon was.
---
That felt *good* to answer.
---
Way, way later down the line, answers was more and more going towards "cash shop" and was more or less one of the reasons as to why I quit the game.
---
f2p game btw
---
When you get fucked by Anet and say thank you afterwards.
---
At least it's money spent on something that isn't worthless irl.
---
&gt;I guess you could argue because I converted gold to gems that I got it "through fractals" or "through raids" since that's where my gold came from, but that's just being obtuse.
---
The other day someone toid me that you could technically get mount skins in game through opening black lion chests so that means they're an in-game reward.
---
The real problem is they hardly ever release earnable stuff anymore. Obviously there's a lot of stuff from the past when they did release plenty of that stuff.
---
In my experience, farming LS4 currencies by converting Bjora currency is much faster than actually farming them in their respective maps. If you're effective, you can easily get a stack of Ice Shards in an hour, which translates to 100 of any LS4 currency. Good luck achieving the same in the actual LS4 maps.
---
Personally I did the skyscale collection a few weeks before the Bjora patch landed, but it wasn't all that terrible. I set myself a goal to collect a minimum of 25 of each map's currency per day (well, I got a stack of Kralkatite in a single day so that was excluded), and usually I managed closer to fifty. Took a week or so, but not rushing it made it feel a lot more relaxed.
---
1) wvw players dont use metabuilds that can deal with this.
---
2) you dont need sustain when you kill them in 20 seconds tops
---
3) less overall dmg doesnt matter, who cares if i can do more dmg in 5 minutes, the bursts and how often you can burst matter much more.
---
3) high skill ceiling doesnt matter as much as the low skill floor. i mean even just 3 button burst with 2 of them instant cast and less than 0.4 cast on gs2 (with quickness, not even factoring lag) can kill people, come on now...
---
4) anyone playing this build long enough can get clips like these, just like you have clips months old. with that amount of time ofc there will be clips like this
---
This sweater also cuts and removes any part of gloves above wrist, thus preventing clipping in first place. You can use it to have gloves with small ice shards from Glacial Gauntlet for example.
---
It has a few of those now ...
---
There's a problem when your endgame content ist mostly focus on cosmetic and then you sell the majority and the better ones as gemstore exclusive...
---
Thats not much different then something like WoW selling the current highest tier armor set only in ther store instead of making it available ingame.
---
And stop with those "bUt yOU CAn bUY GeMS wItH In gAMe goLD" excusing every **** decision anet upper managment does...
---
It matters that the content and experience is tied to the reward. If I can get the mount by doing literally anything or by swiping my creditcard, its not as memorable or special.
---
How much time do I need to reserve for fractals/raids? Can a semi casual player keep up with all the new content and be relevant?
---
agreed. there are good reasons why GW2's f2p version is often described as more of a "trial" version. the full game is still b2p. calling it f2p is just trying to excuse the extent of MTX we got.
---
I'm just sitting here like "Finally, a sword/Torch combo to go with Pharrus."
---
And they were at ~7-10s each (so 700g+ total) instead of the ~1s you pay now, so much more expensive
---
That kind of "balances" the materials for Winter's Presence. I get that it's still expensive to craft, but imo it's also not something for new(er) players
---
everyone hail the new king in town.
---
It was a good idea... except they then decided to give practicaly every skill or talent some sort of boon or condition so most classes can explode and get 10+ effects on themselves.  And then threw in a ton of special buffs on top of that for good measure.
---
Inb4 they troll us with purple seraph weapons instead.
---
it is still helping them in the sense that you influence the exchange rate, which in turn influences other players in rather paying with cash rather than gold. it's a double edged sword.
---
Or maybe world 3? I mean it is what we wanted for years and years and years. If they are fixing festivals, give us world 3!!!(KTXb :D)
---
And it won't be the last.
---
That's just the way I like it. Keep references coming.
---
&gt; And think of all the scenes NOT listed by OP. Are there equivalents in the movie to anything beyond the five above?
---
Just because I compared a few shots to show some similarities between the movie and the game doesn't mean the whole thing must be a carbon copy. There are some more parallels - settings, designs and concepts you'll notice while watching the movie. Not everything could be easily captured in a comparison shot.
---
Obviously Path of Fire should have a lot in common with Nightfall, being the sequel of GW, taking place in the same universe. It would be very weird if it didn't. 
---
&gt; All relations to fires and forges is pretty much a given __once Balthazar was decided__. And there's only so many ways to design a giant forge.
---
See, that's an interesting point. After HoT, no one knew where story would lead us. Season 3 had us traveling all over Tyria, featuring what we thought was Lazarus (later Balthazar, then again Lazarus), the White Mantle and __two__ Elder Dragons, Jormag and Primordus rising. The story created an exciting setting only to put both of them to sleep again within a single small Living World Episode. Then, in the very last Episode, the Eye of Janthir showed us Balthazar, now being in Elona.
---
All things considered, they had hundreds of choices to continue the story after HoT. They could have dealt with Jormag. They could have used Primordus. If they already decided Balthazar to be part of the story, they could have sent him to Cantha as well, or have him going after the Deep Sea Dragon or something completely different. But they chose to feature Balthazar in Elona, acting very much like his equivalent 'Set' in the movie, around the same time it was released. It seems much more likely to me that they were influenced by the movie in general than believing in hundreds of coincidences and generic fantasy designs, also considering that Guild Wars already had a lot of references to popular media in the past.
---
Shit i need banners when i raid, i must be bad at raiding
---
Here is a strange and totally mindblowing thought. Ok are you ready?  Get 25 Quarts Crystals. Go to a comunable herochallange and charge it. TADAAAAAA! You now have one. Do same thing tomorrow and the day after. 
---
Imagine that you did this frequently or at least since you found out that you will need them and you will have a amount of them that covers events or collections like this.
---
Not too much time. Daily fractals can be done in under an hour and are mostly fairly obvious what to do if you pay attention to your teammates or ask when you're not sure. Saying you're new will almost always prompt people to help you. 
---
Raids benefit from organised training (usually with a guild). 
---
Get yourself a set of exotic gear with appropriate stats and gradually replace it with ascended as you go up fractal levels.
---
It was a sarcastic comment.
---
Sorry I meant exchanging Writs of Experience for Tomes üòÖ
---
Do your dailies for 2 gold in 15 minutes. Wintersday at the moment is quite easy to get gold from if you just sell the gifts on the trading post. Meta events can be quite profitable and many are farmed. PvP can earn you a bit of gold, too. Fractals are quite profitable.
---
If you wipe at 2% you don't deserve the kill.
---
It is worth doing it for the insane amount of karma you can gain and the presents that you can either open or sell for a lot of gold.
---
I had no issues getting the 30 skins. Because I actually wanted them.
---
Its a pretty common thing people say. Want something for your raid run? You are bad because raids are easy. Don't want to carry bads? You know nothing about the game because good players can carry bads without issues. Don't feel like doing CMs weekly because no rewards? You are casual and bad because rewards do not matter to good players.
---
It's true you can only buy it in a store. But since one of my guldies did that thinking he would get both, and he didn't, I thought it was worth pointing out.
---
I have spoken
---
Obviously I'm limited in gw2 raiding experience, so take what I say with a grain of salt. First off, you have to remember that gw2 raids are 10 man events. There will be no point where you're individual contribution of dps feels insignificant. Remember how impactful one solid dps could make on 10 man raids in WoW? It's like that. There is also no such thing as overgearing. Stats are locked in to specific thresholds, so once you get to ascended level stats that is it. That means your mechanics and rotation matter a lot more than gear. Finally, aoe damage isn't a joke like it is in WoW. Last night on Vale Guardian I was getting chucked by the green circle mechanic (Distributed Magic I believe it is called.) I was taking 9.3k damage to my 11.6k health. Coupled with the boss's 1.8k raid wide dps aura, I was left with very little health to survive any additional damage. So basically, mechanics are a lot more punishing for failing them than they were in WoW. I guess in summary, gw2 raids require a bit more reaction time but are easier to finish cleanly than in WoW.
---
None of the 30 have moved at all.  
---
Look at the pic on /wiki.
---
Hmm. I cant imagine why I consider an all encompasing currency that you generate naturally a completely different thing to all of the unique forms of earning you have above. Literally all of those have their own methods to obtain. They actually require specific effort, rewarding specific goals. Seriously dude, at least try not being disingenuous.
---
Clayton commented on a post a while back that just said ‚Äú:)‚Äù then something along the lines of ‚Äúit‚Äôs the little things‚Äù and ‚Äúfirst one found.‚Äù   Hype?
---
There is literally new earnable stuff with every single meta achievement/reward track for every release. In recent releases, there have been entire weapon and armor sets to earn.
---
If you afk for half an hour it means that your dollies are dead and the instance likely closed. You simply dont afk in a empty instance, leave it and rejoin another one.
---
Tbf I dont deny some people will be that savvy. But the vast majority wont care.
---
You didnt know you could buy them from the trader? didnt you watch a guide before going for the skyscale? lol
---
If you honestly think me, being logical in my arguments (unlike people like you) is me being a "troll" or "whiteknight", because you don't like hearing contradictory arguments to your personal belief, then you're pretty stupid.
---
I'm merely an individual who slams EVERYONE indiscriminately when they say/claim/do anything illogical, regardless of who they are - and SHOCKER...I expect the same treatment. It does not matter to me if you are an ANet dev, some random person on the internet, a family member, SO, friend, boss, etc. If you are being illogical, expect me to expose you...and if that hurts your precious feelings...then that's too bad.
---
&gt; The leak showed a single shot of the Crystal Oasis
---
People found the email of the playtester by playing with the picture's contrast, a watermark basically. It was playable.
---
&gt; A complete Living World Episode with a full new map in Season 3 had around 9 months of development time (probably with a much smaller team).
---
A living world episode doesn't involve elite specs, game-changing gameplay features with numerous different animations for each races and so on. The reason why the production of a LS episode goes faster is because it follows a pattern that make them easy to ship.
---
This doesn't apply to an expansion.
---
&gt; that doesn't mean they couldn't have parts of the content and story being influenced by the movie after all.
---
The narrative design (and therefore the scripts and storyline) are usually among the first things decided and determined since they heavily influence the direction of the game.
---
You used Balthazar's odd behavior as an example to support your point, but you failed to realize that his path has been decided at the beginning of LS3 way before the movie was released. The same kind of logic applies here. PoF's story direction was decided in 2015 at the earliest. And that story includes yes, the Underworld (a very popular theme in the GW since **the first game**), Kormir's library, the Forged and so on.
---
As of whether or not there was a direct influence we will likely never know. Tons of games, books, stories have similarities with other products. It happens. 
---
I really don't understand what you're trying to achieve here since you seem interested to argue your point?... And for what purpose?... What do you want to achieve here?
---
It was never gated by the charged crystal.  
---
Only if you didn't have any and avoided buying food on the TP.
---
most ppl i met in wvw played builds can deal with the build i play pretty well, on same skill lvl i would not have any chance with my builds. 
---
i die in 2 autoattacks from most classes durign i have to hit certain combos with casttimes dictating the whole combo and well telegraphed animations easy to dodge. there is a reason no decent players consider powermes hard to beat or even viable (aside form onehsots out of nowhere bu thats not what i do tho). what class(es) do you play? maybe a ranger or deadeye can oneshot with just one button instead of 5/6? or with 2 from 1500 range from a save spot you dont even need to dodge but still have more dodges than a mesmer? 
---
seriously this powermes hate is ridiculous. i get it for stealthspam builds attacking ppl without them even aware of a starting fight or for condimesmer but nothing of this happens in my vid. powermes doesnt have a low skill floor but as said play my builds and upload some footage.
---
you refer to the wvw clips in my vid they are collected from 2 days (the last weekend as i mentioned in the vid description and not months old) but i give you 1 month to get 12 mins of footage incl outnumbereds and fights vs hardcounters you do not attack first. all oneshots in my vids were completely predictable and interactive. all were fair engagements. but i get tired of talking because words are patient. just prove how ez full glass power mes in wvw is or my interrupt mirage in high tier pvp gameplay and send me footage. everyone can talk how easy he would get footage yet im still waiting for a single one proving it. also you would get the footage way easier with most other builds (incl other non meta builds) in the game. come back when you have prove thanks.
---
I spent a lot of time with this game. I did the betas and started on the headstart of 25th of August 2012. I really, really liked the early game. My fondest memories will always be my time spent with people in WvW, fighting for our realm (Seafarer's Rest.) I played that for hours.
---
It was around the time before Heart of Thorns coming out my interest in the game started to fade more and more. Really did *not* like the route they took with player equipment aesthetics (over the top glow everywhere) and how the cash shop got way, way more focus.
---
I'm still here to see what route the game is taking, and I can't say it looks any better. Plus I feel nostalgic when I see other people mentioning some good old times.
---
I still check WoW subreddit, too.
---
ding ding ding. bingo. Theres also the fact that a gold "grind" is a different way of looking at it. You get gold just by playing, you dont have to go out of your way to get it. In a way its passively obtained, by doing anything. So, if you wanted a gemstore item, you take that gold and focus it on one non-earnable item, stopping you from putting it towards actual goals. In a way, it stops you playing the proper game. Course thats all subjective, but its how i see it.
---
&gt; Id rather leave that to you mr logic.
---
You disappoint me, but I'd be lying if I said I expected otherwise.
---
That's like saying: you argued this. I don't understand it and I refuse to think about the argument you have made, but I will argue against it anyway because I don't like how it sounds because it goes against my personal beliefs.
---
I just started playing again last year. I didn't even have ascended armor when I got back, because it didn't exist when I was still playing... Also, the power creep was insane. I eventually settled on deadeye, because I couldn't give up my thief, but S/D got boring and everything else felt underwhelming. 
---
Over all, I still love this game though. I just didn't have time or a good PC to play for a long time.
---
Do what ever you want with the gem store, but give us cool stuff to get ingame rather than farming gold. Collections are AMAZING feature and Anet should double down on it.
---
holy shit this wall of text.
---
i saw clips from no downstate week in there and if im not mistaken, no downstate event was kinda long ago.
---
i played power shatter mesmer before hot, dont try to tell me oneshotting people now is harder than back then lmao...
---
nowadays i log into the game like once a month because the game has no future, theres no point putting time into this game after the great summer announcement
---
What does that mean? Like the flame weapons from Halloween this year, as apposed to something brand new?
---
There's been dev explanations of the exchange - apart from an initial seed of gold and gems at launch it's all what people add by trading. 
---
While it would be theoretically possible to empty one pool, the exchange rate would become so ludicrously bad that there is no way you'd be able to before other players would counteract it by selling whatever you're trying to buy up.
---
Okay dude. Sure. Youre dissappointed because Im not jumping through your hoops for self explanatory things. Okay. I hope one day you look back on this and cringe, because itll be a better future for you. Meanwhile Im just going to laugh at you. Thanks for the entertainment, you have truly been so deluded into your own superiority its frankly side-splittingly funny.
---
What about a new gem store item?
---
I have no issue with them charging for cosmetics, though some people really do, but they definitely focus way more on gem store cosmetics than content for the game
---
And it's not *exactly* f2p. It's b2p, still need to get the game and expansions, plus you need to buy previous living worlds if you weren't around for them in the first place.  It's not like dota or something that's purely f2p
---
There are items you'll need along your journey to skyscale that if you craft them yourself, it'll require a Charged Quartz.   
---
That said, the finished items can also be purchased on the TP if you have a moderate amount of Gold
---
What‚Äôs moderate? I have a few hundred.
---
There's no content behind earning real money or grinding gold from various sources to acquire a gemstore item.  Conversly, Legendary weapons and collection items have a quest you need to do, tend to come with content relevant to what you're getting as a reward, and have far more engagement than what it takes to earn gems.
---
Converting gems to gold and buying on marketboard!
---
Dont worry about it, it happens xD
---
i said it as it is. you play build with low skill floor and try to make it out to be the hardest thing ever. i watch these videos to see how the game changed and i see the same stupid shit every time. easy bursts with little to no setup are not skill, sorry. theres a reason most competitive games dont let you 1 shot anyone unless that 1 shot requires actual skill (fighting games, shooter games, even moba).
---
want to see videos? just put power mesmer wvw into youtube search, youll find plenty of oneshots
---
All dailies on all accounts. Then do orphan run on all accts and use karma to buy the daily boxes from vendor. Then just farm one acct and do the jp till your eyes bleed(honestly jp isnt hard) and save those gifts then sell after event. If u have the time do all festival achs to get u the 50ap and thats a stack of gifts too.
---
&gt; ...you still had to run the dungeon and you can't directly buy tokens with gold...
---
Correct. What are you doing to acquire those tokens? Identify that and you will have a better understanding of what I've said.
---
&gt; You can't just swipe your credit card to buy these either.
---
Correct again...but, what do you do to acquire them? The answer lies in that activity.
---
&gt; This requires doing a lot of fractals.
---
What is that activity called? There's an actual term for it.
---
&gt; You gotta raid for this one. Oh and provisioner tokens, you still have to run around and get those.
---
Right. Very good. Again, what is the term you use for that activity...which is common across all of them?
---
&gt; you have to do a lot of account bound shit you can't just buy.
---
...but in essence, you are buying it, because you are spending time and putting in effort in acquiring something to pay for something to own that something, right?
---
Does it really matter what a currency is called when it is a currency that is required for the purchase of a good, which you earn by playing the game? A currency, regardless of the name given to it or the acquisition method is still a currency.
---
All gemstore items are purchasable through the use of gold...and what is gold? That's right...a currency...one which you can acquire by playing the game through various means. It's an unrestricted currency. While you have the option to pay money to skip the "gold grind" (you're not actually skipping it - you're grinding in the real world), you have the complete freedom to not do so, and still acquire everything in the gemstore.
---
Well I would have been excited if it meant we were getting more of other content instead of just new maps but it seems we aren't so no I'm not.
---
Please do this entire subreddit a favor and don't post anymore before you dig the hole deeper.
---
1. GW2 was B2P originally and this stuff happened even back then.
---
2. ANet, a gaming company with only one game to focus on, had HUNDREDS of employees. DO NOT say they had "minimal staff". The literal sole reason they exist is to handle GW1's maintenance mode and GW2, that's it.
---
3. GW2 was one of the biggest MMOs at the time, not just in popularity, but for NCSoft as well.
---
4. GW2 was constantly considered one of the best MMOs you could buy.
---
Thank you for the great reply! I don't think I'm currently ready for fractals (I've never heard of them and think I should play a bit first xD) but I'll check out the wintersday. I'll also find some events to farm!
---
Well, that makes more sense. The post made it seem as if the problem is that new players are disappointed to find out a lot of cool skins are only available from the gem store.
---
&gt; Correct. What are you doing to acquire those tokens? Identify that and you will have a better understanding of what I've said.
---
Dungeons, WvW, PvP.  You can do any and all three of those to earn the skins.  Two actually give good gold rewards, if that's what you're getting at, while one leaves you with more karma than sense.
---
&gt; Correct again...but, what do you do to acquire them? The answer lies in that activity.
---
Farming maps and metas that reward you with the currency that you then use to buy the trinkets.  It takes less than a week to get one, and less than a month to get enough for a single character.
---
&gt; Right. Very good. Again, what is the term you use for that activity...which is common across all of them?
---
That's not a grind.  You progress through raids once or twice a week.  Provisioner tokens are also not a grind either. Those are a sink for materials and have other rewards tied to them as well and can only have so many of them earned per day.  Legendary armor also requires far more than just those two things too.  Interactive things != Grind. 
---
&gt; ...but in essence, you are buying it, because you are spending time and putting in effort in acquiring something to pay for something to own that something, right?
---
No.  That's not how an interactive quest works.  You're not buying it.  Buying something involves trading goods or currency to acquire a good, service, or currency.
---
&gt; you're not actually skipping it - you're grinding in the real world
---
Dude, real money you earn in real life is used to pay for the cost of living.  It's not a grind.  It's necessary to live in this world currently.  Whatever you have left over is what you have to spend on whatever you want.  Some people choose to spend this to skip things in games or buy things they like.
---
You are paying to skip a glorified gold grind or otherwise miss out on the "Limited sales" despite the gemstore being literally digital and should have a seemingly infinite amount of data that could be stored upon it for unlocks.  I don't think you're quite grasping what I'm getting at.  Nothing you get in the gemstore is ever earned for free.  Someone's always paid real money for the gems you buy with gold.  The whole system is set up to make you want to use your wallet.  Besides that, you don't earn enough gold in a single month just by playing the game and doing your dailies to acquire anything that's a temporary sale on the gemstore outside of maybe one or two things on the store depending on exchange rates at the time.
---
I don't know how to explain this to you, but in short, things that require my interaction that aren't just doing laps around the world or a map (with a couple exceptions) != grind.  Having to do collection achievements isn't a grind.  Having me sink materials earned from a map isn't a grind.  What is a grind, however, is having a general currency that's earned by basically pennies a day and have a store where the conversion rates are so inflated that I barely can afford anything on the store without paying real money. 
---
This is the difference between cash shop "rewards" and ingame rewards.
---
Cash shop is either grind your face off to earn enough gold to buy the thing for "Free" or swipe your credit/debit card and skip playing.
---
Ingame rewards is a quest or series of achievements to earn a fancy, flashy skin that took time and effort to acquire.  
---
Imagine how less prestigious skins from raids would be if you could simply buy them direclty.
---
No they're not. They're all right features. A random checklist of shit to collect that does absolutely nothing isn't AMAZING. It's subpar. Especially when you're forging a weapon and all you do is pick up crap that doesn't actually turn into anything.

There you go: [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/brs41g/complete_skyscale_unlock_guide/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) and [GW2 Wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Skyscale) guides.

This christmas you say? That's very optimistic of you, but I wish you best of luck lol.
---
If the cape would have been a reward for playing Wintersday stuff I would actually be online right now.
---
They don't keep these statistics because every gem in the entire game has already been paid for with real currency (only exception are the ones from achievement chests). Only real dollars turn to gems. These can then be spent and disappear again. Or they can be "traded" to other players via currency exchange, you exchange your gold for the gems that someone else has bought. Anet profits either way.
---
&gt;Do you earn your celestial infusion?
---
you mean the blurry shitty ones ?
---
Sadly Dulfy has *retired* and focusing on IRL stuff now, so no more guides for us. But luckily wiki and reddit community doing great job in this regard.
---
Congrats! I know the feeling. Vale Guardian smashed my face a bunch before I got the hang of it. 
---
I also may have been carried by a good group at the time, but I can't quite remember...

It actually is. Gems you buy with gold are gems people bought with real money and exchanged for gold. Why else do you think that the gold to gems ratio fluctuates? It's definitely not because they're simulating a fake market.
---
We will never get it. Sorry.
---
If we wanna make Josh Foreman's dreams come true, then the community should make an "Ultra Adventure Box" fangame
---
Doesn't this game have enough holidays?
---
ANet, your drone is making it obvious again.
---
Dude your "logic" has consisted of
---
1) comparing buying things with a universal currency, to specific goals that require a very specific gamemode/content type and have unique methods of obtaining
---
2) telling me im "not thinking for myself" when i decided not to waste my time explaining something you already know just because you said it 
---
3) telling people they dont understand their own argument because they arent following your rules
---
Like christ. For someone who spouts logic so much you use none of it. Thats why people think youre a moron xD. Seriously, get out of your own way and actually think before you speak.
---
My what? I don‚Äôt know why you have to talk about me instead of what I‚Äôm saying
---
&gt;Considering a gemstore is a trade off for not having a sub fee
---
FFXIV and WoW have one, so this excuse has NEVER been valid.
---
We had a slight chance but after Josh‚Äôs departure it is probably never going to happen
---
&gt; there's actually a ridiculous amount of earnable rewards in GW2.
---
Now compare it to the usually superior stuff on the gem store and the fact most of the good stuff IS on the gem store or the stupid black lion lootboxes.
---
&gt;If you honestly think me, being logical in my arguments
---
Imagine being so blind and trapped in your own bubble.
---
Because their lives suck, so they need to act like they're superior to the rest even when they're clearly wrong.
---
That‚Äôs the QoL changes planned for late 2020. It‚Äôll only cost 500 gems to unlock a second buff bar.
---
Don‚Äôt remind me of Poncho man
---
You still using a CRT?
---
Yeah but you don‚Äôt have buy anything
---
Most of them are from when the game launched.
---
&gt;I will BEG you, stop using this excuse just to defend ANet's mistakes.
---
It's not an excuse, it's a fact. Without the cash shop GW2 would have shuttered or gone into maintenance years ago. They absolutely **need** to keep the cash shop fresh and interesting. That's not an excuse, not a lie, not PR spin. Problem is, they started going too far with too much good stuff in the cash shop and not as an ingame reward. And once you do that you get stuck really. Either take a big financial hit as you reorganize how the cash shop works and what it offers, pissing off the people in charge of money and probably some consumers, or keep going, pissing off some consumers but keeping the people upstairs happy (which tends to keep the lights on).
---
Uhh, a lot of that IS from the Gem Store. 
---
That is an extreme fail.
---
I know that feeling. It's just deflating on so many levels. It saps any pride you may have had personally over having an item someone wanted and it just feels cheap when you have to say "the store" over pointing them to a cool quest or dungeon or whatever.
---
If this were some other game aping GW2 the replies in this thread would be very different.
---
&gt;It's not an excuse, it's a fact.
---
It is not a fact, thank you for not bothering to read my comment just to keep sucking up to ANet.
---
for those who choose to use it to that extent. I haven't spent a penny on the store, though I buy every game/chapter as it comes out. All my gemstore cosmetics and such I've gotten via gem exchange.
---
Not saying not to use it or anything, just that it's a fully optional cost
---
activating simple party ui will show only boons/condis
---
So......you got nothing basically.
