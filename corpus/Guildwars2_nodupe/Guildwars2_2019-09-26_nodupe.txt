&gt;We pretended during the whole first half of LW4.
---

---
Kralk was a pretty big part of Episodes 1 and 2. More 1 than 2, but a heavy presence in both. Just not *the* main plot.
---
---
---
Yeah, I used to use Sword #3 in fractal CM bosses all the time along with GS #3, GS Auto and very rarely Sword #2. 
---
This is yet another change, along with the Scourge not being able to hit on him as well as on the sand shade ( which was one of the main "Scourge flavor" things for me, otherwise might as well have all the shroud skills with a ground targeter ), that makes my favorite classes less fun to play ( the other was the Chrono shatter change... ), but I guess its alright since I don't play anymore anyways.
---
Hell, just getting Bangar to remove the only known Jormag-killing weapon from our merry band of dragon-killers would be a big enough reason on its own.  Getting a few hundred new meat popsicles for his army is just the icing on the cake.
---
I still play my Chrono in WvW, but only in roaming/havoc. There is no point in me joining up with the zerg when it passes for a bit anymore.
---
Omadd's Machine wasn't what he was talking about.
---
He was referring to the alliances, Breachmaker, Prime Hologram, and Twisted Marionette. These were weapons and forces Scarlet was developing to "confront" Mordremoth.
---
Of course, she was being manipulated by Mordremoth the entire time, so while she thought she was confronting it, she was actually aiding it.
---
Yes, it would attempt to finish you again if it got interrupted. In most cases, it simply didn't have enough time left to finish, although sometimes it worked.
---
It's also got 1k health, so even light taps destroy it.
---
I've been playing condi Mirage for a while, never even got around to talenting Chrono. Got around to it the other day, though, and went to look for a good, up-to-date Chrono build.
---
There weren't any.
---
&gt; i dont get why bangar wants to oppose the commander, doesn’t he know we killed 3 elder dragons, 2 gods , 1 mursaat, 1 lich king, and a shit ton of trash mobs? and we have 1 elder dragon who commands 3 kinds of magicks.
---
Cuz he thinks the pact did it and if the commander is alone, like the first one on one with Balthazar, they could lose.
---
Note that none of these were ascended/legendary beings at their full power vs the commander and we're greatly weakened by the pact for the commander to finish them off.
---
Also commader never killed a mursaat, that mursaat was Balthazar disguising as Lazarus. I know Balthazar was killed, but who was the second god killed by the commander?
---
It's not that we want a free auto finish.
---
It's that this is supposed to be our "elite mechanic." It's supposed to DEFINE scrapper like reaper shroud defines reaper, or continuum split defines chrono. Instead it's just a worthless hunk of crap.
---
This change is precisely to carve out space for Chrono again, i think. This gives Chrono a freed utility slot where it can bring fight-specific tools that firebrand and renegade cannot match, most notably Portal.
---
To be fair, technically scrapper has two elite mechanics, the gyro and the constant perpetual barrier. Personally I think it works well enough. One demand revives and stomps on a 25 second(ish) cd from range is pretty good, I don't need them to go through all the time for the impact to be felt.
---
That don't go away on recharge either. It's 1000% better in every way.
---
Bangar isn't opposing the commander. He's working to even the scale on a strategic, military scale. While the commander is officially a free agent (Not part of the Pact directly, loosely aligned with their order), Bangar is treating them as still being part of the command structure.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also, the charr never went directly to war with Kralk, they just handled the brand and kept it contained.
---
Its a WvW driven change and it ends up being a buff in wvw probably, although it was meant to be a nerf, which just shows how poor their balancing is.
---
&lt;raises hand&gt;
---
I did, but I honestly got kind of bored after a couple months. It was a lot more fun when I was a kid. It’s still a bit of fun but I’m picky about a lot of stupid shit now when it comes to games. And honestly, seeing a lot of the cool things being added in the /coxg/ server or w/e makes homecoming look a bit bland in comparison. I already have so much characters on homecoming (and another account so I can plvl myself when server population isn’t high), so I’d really prefer not to switch to the other server and have to start over again. Plus my only friend that still plays the same kind of games as me these days hasn’t seemed like he can get into it that’s why I got back on gw2.
---
Its never too late.
---
WvW plyers have asked for scourge nerfs virtually since PoF dropped. This was meant to be a nerf that ends up being a buff in WvW due to the target change.
---
And if you take the trait that just gives you one big shade, your other traits just got deleted. Cool!
---
We killed Lazarus in Episode 6 of Season 3, just saying.
---
I wish the game still had more unique class effects/skills etc , just balanced well. I prefer to have classes with  unique strengths and weaknesses with a reason to bring each, rather than boring homogenisation.
---
&gt; After the illusion he was under was dispelled by the joint efforts of the Commander, [Taimi](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Taimi) and [Kasmeer Meade](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Kasmeer_Meade), Lazarus's true identity turned out to be none other than [Balthazar](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Balthazar), the [God](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Six_Human_Gods) of War. Having betrayed his [White Mantle](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/White_Mantle) followers and taken on [mercenary](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Balthazar%27s_Mercenaries) armies, the exposed god stole [Taimi](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Taimi)'s [device](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Taimi%27s_Machine) designed to simultaneously kill the [Elder Dragons](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Elder_Dragon) [Primordus](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Primordus) and [Jormag](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Jormag) and retreated to [Draconis Mons](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Draconis_Mons) to use it on Primordus. In the heart of the volcano before Primordus, he joined into the energy trails linking Primordus and Jormag and began absorbing their magic as he had done to the Maguuma Bloodstone in an attempt to slay the two Elder Dragons and take their power.
---
[That wasn't Lazarus, that was Balthazar...](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Lazarus)
---
 I literally said this.
---
Aw, this is fantastic! Fun like this is what GW2 is all about for me.
---
(That said, I'm not super good at racing... but I'd love to watch!)
---
It's hard enough as a Mirage trying to stay near Mirrors, and they're not even half as crucial as Wells.
---
F in Chat for PvE scourge
---
Confused about the Chrono trait Danger Time.
---
I have 65.05% crit rate, and I am testing on a dummy with permanent slow applied and permanent fury applied to myself. That should give me +15 and +20 for a 100% crit rate, but ArcDPS is saying I am around 95%. Am I not understanding something correctly, should the trait not give me a flat +15% increase in chance?
---
Check your phantasm skills. I don't think they have 100% crit.
---
Place one shade away. Oh fuck, place one shade on me. Oh fuck, enemies runs. Oh fuck, place shade again on me. Oh fuck, no more shades and enemies is not in any of my 3 shades.
---
Sounds like fun.
---
Are you sure it's not ranger's F1?
---
But we have staff!!! /s
---
I've always thought ANET needed to choose a side with guardian and stop trying so hard to make it a hybrid.  Over the years you can tell, with their traits, that they were trying to do too much with the class.
---
The Danger Time trait says that the bonus is applied to my Illusions
---
I just changed my gear, had full assassin to 80% and with the fury bonus, I had 100% crit on ArcDPS using the same Phantasms.
---
I don't think your phantasms get the fury bonus. Check wiki for full info about stats that illusions gain from you.
---
im pretty sure their plan wasnt to just handle the brand and contain it for all eternity, surely they cant be that dumb, charr were born and bred for war. any decent surely knows the only way to win the war is to kill the king. or are you invalidating their entire existence?
---
i mean they did a stellar job containing the brand seeing as the brand spread to elona.
---
To be fair, a mesmer can use double swords and would likely lie about all sorts of shit
---
Yes, but having read the traits, they come across as pretty inept in terms of defense. Stacking flat toughness does not a good defensive build make.
---
EDIT: I just checked it and the issue are my Illusions. Phantasm and my skills were all 100% crit, just the useless Illusions auto attacks didn't. I have the trait for Phantasms spawn with Fury as well, as an aside.
---
Thanks for your help =)
---
Oh wait, I forgot about staff, but yeah it's not a damage weapon.
---
does this article take into account starving college kids? lmfao
---
Do you even fucking know what the "lowest rung in American society" even LOOKS like?
---
As a necro main - the death magic changes come off as honestly quite lazy. It's just a stacking buff that gives you toughness, and maybe might, if you trait it
---
F3 for barrier, then F1, 2, 4, 5. Still give you and ten of your allies barrier, then hit 10 enemies with that F2 boonflip, fear, and Desert Shroud.  
---
Or if you really want WvW memes you get in groups of 1 FB, 1 scrap, 3 Scourges. Smoke next to a portal and precast Harbinger shroud, push out of the portal and nuke everyone when your Shroud detonates 3 seconds later. Kek.
---
The barrier was only added a few months ago. It's never been considered the elite mechanic. 
---
&gt; One demand revives and stomps on a 25 second(ish) cd from range is pretty good 
---
The f-gyro has about 1000 health, every revive increases the cooldown, and will now be destroyed by cc. It's weak enough that a downed enemy can kill it without using CC. Forget the random AoE that flies around these days.
---
if you talking about fractals,literaly every person in CMs have portal from raids.... HFB with RENE gona carry every group in the world with 12 boons and imunity to condi dmg,while doing ok dmg. chrono is clunky asf now and his utility/dmg/boons just dont match firebrigade and probably never will. Im still shocked that hfb is a thing,bcs its literaly chaos chrono before all nerfs + heal and good dmg... aaaaaaaand no1 give a fuck,bcs yeeey diversity,now we gona play firebrigade for few years and than ppl gona ask,can some other classes give boons?
---
It was actually a buff on the gyro -- you could see the timer if you had it on your screen.
---
This is exactly why I don't buy outfits, not worth 10 bucks man
---
Guardian and Firebrand are dominating PvE, your opinion is 2 years too late. ^^
---
5000 health seemed to be an appropriate level -- it couldn't be destroyed by the downed person, but anybody who was up and nearby could cleave it down with no difficulty.
---
Space bikini?
---
Sword 3 was one of the best dodges. 2 felt clunky to use though. They needed to change the 2 eventually, but I am not too excited about the one they choose to go on
---
First Person Camera helps you get rid of the constant right mouse button pressure, have you tried it?
---
For why Toughness isn't useful: ["Unlike other stats, toughness suffers from diminishing returns"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3bnnbp/unlike_other_stats_toughness_suffers_from/)
---
Upvote for effort
---
And now wrongful claims. What a treat you are.
---
If playing with power, I don't mind it. Support is trashed.
---
&gt; you'll loose bloodlust if you go into water and switch to a harpoon, even if the other weapon also has bloodlust
---
This isn't true.
---
You're right. He's wrong.
---
That is awesome!  I’m slowly getting better at the beetle.  Dragon Bash helped me a lot.
---
It's a fanmade animation from fire emblem sacred stones. The healer, Moulder, is kind of a meme. People call him Moulder the Boulder.
---
I suppose I should have been clearer, I meant for pve and pvp. Wvw this is an entirely different beast, I agree. Pve just gets screwed though, especially lower end content like disorganized metas and fractals. It's going to be impossible to support both yourself and the melee blob. This change is just horrendous.
---
I think I'm gonna switch mains. I tried pretending this rework was live to see how it would have felt. It was awful, I never want to play this when it goes live.
---
A: The contained the brand within Ascalon. This means literally keeping branded from spreading out from it.
---
B: The brand comes from Kralkatorrik. After waking up, he flew south and parked himself within the crystal desert. The charr never had a chance to actually assault him.
---
C: Charr never actually planned to march their armies against the dragon, but sent help to the orders/Pact which went after the dragons while maintaining forces to deal with local threats (Brand, Flame Legion, Ogres, Anti-treaty groups, ghosts, etc).
---
Also, killing the king may end the war, or it may cause it to increase and extend. Not all armies break, some go berserk and fight until the last.
---
Is it normal for living season nodes to be available from loot drops?
---
Even for a defensive trait line it seems rather underwhelming. I don't know about PvP and WvW, but I can't see this being good for anything in PvE. This just makes the effort of reworking the whole trait line seem a bit pointless. I mean sure, you can run it and do just fine in open world, story etc but you can run any random crap there and get through (remember the guy who finished the story with warrior dodge roll damage only?).
---
Yup this is why scourge is now food in pvp. What a joke.
---
No need to re-roll the class. Chrono is still outstanding for open world play, and I regularly swap between it and Mirage on my Mesmer main. Mesmer don’t currently have a great WvW Zerg build, but they’re very versatile, and fit just about every other game mode in some aspect. Between the two elite specs, you’ll find great builds for WvW roaming, PvP, and all levels of PvE play.
---
What about it?
---
No, that's just 'cause I moved the camera with it + mouse :D
---
[removed]
---
Dont tell anyone a scrapper told you this...but function gyro is only really to self-stab and give you a lightning field to do rocket charge while thunderclap is on cooldown. You're more likely to survive by generating barrier for yourself through attacking a downed player anyway
---
Yes I tried, but it feels a bit wierd to me. I became so used to those settings.
---
Nah man come on, the thing that defines us is that we're, well, you know...scrappy
---
Look at the background
---
Just gotta time the killing blow and the ICD perfectly.
---
Chrono is still meta in many, if not most, raid encounters. FB and Ren just have more of a place now.
---
I'm on my phone me and I can't see anything unusual.
---
Mind explaining?
---
Nah, our engi kits are better. Unlimited casts ;)
---
Oh yeah for PvP and PvE this change is garbage. Dunno what they're thinking.
---
\-still traumatized from the searing-
---
I don't think weapons should be balanced around range in PvE. Ofc you can reduce the damage for PvP/WvW but it's stupid for PvE since only dps matters and all encounters are mostly melee.
---
&gt;Corrupter's Fervor: This trait has been reworked. It now grants 1 Death's Carapace stack when applying any condition. Additionally, at 25 Death's Carapace stacks or above, the necromancer **gains pulsing protection for 3 seconds every 3 seconds**.
---
What about the 33% direct damage reduction from having perma-protection?
---
I hope Jhavi is a warrior like Jora.
---
Reaper is about to become tankier with reworked Death Magic; kind of wished they took it further and had us spread out the Deaths Carapace effect to squad members as a support buff, make Reapers frontline bunkers (maybe design comps where a Reaper could tank and carry the melee group, while Scourge can heal and barrier the rest of the damage; but no you can only offer support if you choose Scourge I guess; at least I have my Bone Tyrant and Blood Death Knight in ESO and WoW respectively).
---
Easiest way to get any exotic, non chest piece armor of any stat: 
---
Do daylight events in verdant brink, use the crowbars you get from the events to open airship cargo chests scattered around the area. 
---
Use the currency inside (airship gears) to buy exotic Bladed armor pieces from the Itzel vendors in the same map. 
---
It's 500 airship gears per piece, and you can get that many in less than half an hour.
---
I really miss lava fonts actually dealing damage...
---
There's plenty of PvE situations where range makes things way easier. Think about the Chaos fractal's Gladiator, using ranged weapons makes him a cakewalk when he's not stunning you with every third swing. Or every boss in the Nightmare fractal. It's way easier and safer when you can freely move around to avoid pools of vomit and miscellaneous gloop. 
---
It's really only raids where range doesn't make things much easier, and they are a very small part of pve content.
---
Having played GW1 Minion Master, it really was great. It wasn't fire and forget. The minions could only be summoned from corpses, had a passive health degen, and with the maximum of eight skills on your bar you really had to pick and choose how many and which minions to run while also running buff/debuff spells. For example one of the bread and butter Necro minion skills spent your health to heal all of your minions, which allowed the build to effectively function. You had to get the ball rolling yourself, but once you got going it was less about summoning new minions (though that was still necessary) and more about upkeep, managing targets and buffs, and depending on the situation, dishing out some spicy debuffs and (IIRC, it's been a while) blowing up the excess corpses to add to the carnage.
---
I miss GW1 minion master.
---
doing \~\~god's\~\~ wiki's work!
---
The trailer makes less sense to me because he said it's being addressed to Bangar. Champion is our title not Bangar's. The last sentence also sounds like it's directed at us as well. "Stand against me and you stand alone." Bangor wants to join up with Jormag no? Why would Jormag threaten him?
---
Death Nova scaling off your damage now is huge. For Reaper that means Lich Form 4 will be adding ~6.5 gravediggers worty of damage in Death Novas, so already it looks very valuable for burst fights. Might be able to use Rise as well if timed correctly.
---
As for Scourge, for high movement fights where you'll miss dhuumfire procs (like SH) due to the new badly implemented Shade changes, you can run Death Magic instead meaning you can focus on Shade uptime more than management. You get a 15% poison damage mod, condi transfer, and the new Death Nova counts as your hit for bleed on crit.
---
Well, you kinda are doing the same, dude. I'm merely playing along. You been at this for a while already.
---
Yes, minons from Rise trigger death nova as well.
---
This is a video of the guild Good Fights who originally started on Ebay. 
---
If anyone remembers the guild and what they actually meant to this game give a shout out. If you don't know then understand this is the first guild EVER to implement a gank squad in GvG and they did it in 15v15 not 20v20. 
---
Unfortunately the reintroduction of orbs aka bloodlust buffs killed the guild overnight. 
---
Enjoy the video and if you want watch the rest of the videos on Amin's channel. This was one of the funnest nights I've ever had playing the game.
---
later
---
Champion is only recently been a title for us, I think only Bangar uses it.
---
As for standing alone, isn't that how he feels? Ash and Iron legion wanted the treaty (I suspect Ash is more status quo, but is fine with peace with humans). The world is changing and he's seeking to even the odds. As somebody said, He can see the Svanir having a "good" relationship with the dragon, and probably that inspired him to look into dominating the dragon, or making an alliance in his favor.
---
Yup. They just want players to keep on chasing that carrot on a stick.
---
Yeah that all sounds dope. My friend and his brother both played tf out of GW1, he's the one that got me into GW2 in the first place. I was surprised of how much they changed the class and some of the other classes. Wasn't mesmer completely different too? A lot of the stuff they were talking about sounded really cool, and it made me kind of regret not playing that game in its prime. I believe I'd gotten trial codes from getting CoV, along with the other NCSoft titles like Lineage, but I only used the CoH trials because I didn't know p2p was really a thing when I convinced my grandma to get it for me. I've watched them play a few times but that was so many years ago, the most recent time I was really drunk and his brother was showing me necro, but I barely remember anything.
---
But that's the thing dude. You've been assuming all along that I am assuming something. All I said was that if you wanted to know the difference, you could easily look it up. Period. Takes less than a few seconds of your time. And no one is too busy to do that. No one. That's not an assumption, that's fact. Even doctors on call get breaks.
---
our goal was to see if we can figure out how to break the class 2 so we can get auris to update it to class 3 i got to "III" before the timer ran out and the rift closed ! We assume its timed like the rest. I may also just found a bug but its worth exploring or at least figuring out if the class 2 breaks after you cycled through the locations !
---
The nerf to guardian scepter because "the best melee damage option should not be a ranged weapon" is hilarious because it means they understand that ranged weapons are used in melee anyway and thus are nerfing a weapon purely because of aesthetics. What's the end goal here, make every ranged weapon like DH longbow where it's only usage is in PvP where being ranged actually matters? Or are they just mistakenly thinking that there exists some PvE niche (the only game type where scepter is good) where people sit at range to use these weapons?
---
Not to mention it's inconsistent given lots of other classes' optimal weapon sets include ranged weapons (e.g. shortbow on Renegade and Soulbeast/Druid, greatsword on pChrono, etc).
---
I mean I'm all for replacing scepter with sword given how boring scepter is but using "it's a ranged weapon" as the reasoning is so incredibly dumb I'm actually surprised it's coming from Anet and not like the forums or something.
---
Dear Anet,  
---
Please stop nerfing our only good PvE ranged weapon.  
---
Yours truly Every Guardian that exists.
---
ArenaNet already announced it in November, but hey lets make another retarded post like /u/Astraliguss
---
I have a hard time blaming the devs as well. When you had like 1-2 devs total working on PvP/WvW in the past, it’s tough to get stuff done. Then dragging devs out of PvE and telling them to fix broken PvP balance; that isn’t going to work either because they only know PvE.
---
No mercy for enemy!
---
If Warrior Healers could actually do that, I would want a male Warrior to pocket me everywhere I go.
---
Is that information known outside though? Didn't being a member of Shining Blade supressed you to say about this?
---
I mean...of course it would come that soon...there hasn't been a single complaint of timegate for the prologue, just RNG for an infusion.
---
U know u gotta wait a bit for the next episode if there's a timegated item.
---
Is this based on the number of completed new, potentially episode 1, assets being added to the game, or just looking at the calendar.
---
Yes this keeps scrapper out of the PVP meta
---
Since I've been using a fantasy-inspired look for my character, I took this chance to do this look once I saw the metal legion shirt from Grothmar Valley. I personally find this amusing in contrast to other kinds of looks.
---
Headgear: wide rim glasses, chest : metal legion "soldier" size, shoulders: racing scarf, leggings: rogue pants, boots: duelist boots.
---
You lose more than just Dps with Chrono phantasm. Shied 4  phantasm give insane amount of protection uptime if use correctly and without the traits its kinda meh. Focus 5 phatasm reflect is good too on fight with a lot of projectile and having it 2 back to back help with the reflect uptime.
---
SCRAPPER BUFFS?!
---
S C R A P P E R   B U F F S ? !
---
Dude I was Ehmry Bay in original wvw :)
---
Actualy more toughness will help you survive even with powercreep but the right question is "what it cost and did it help you achieve what you want?" For PvE, toughness on gear is useless because you lose damage and support potential. On traits, it depend the build you play and the traits you have to sacrifice for the toughness but it rarely worth it. 
---
For PvP, its an other story because your goal arent the same and toughness could became usefull to achieve what you want to do.
---
Tempest trait changes are very much needed, looking forward to it.
---
Scrapper is getting a buff, but are the buffs sufficient for scrapper to see Meta play? I strongly doubt it.
---
Support Firebrands getting curbstomped again, nothing new. Sword getting a buff? Okay.
---
Mes changes are lackluster. 
---
Necro's death magic rework looks intriguing. 
---
Ranger sword getting its' much needed rework. Sad to lose evade on GS AA.
---
Rev changes are lackluster.
---
Thief changes are lackluster.
---
Warrior warhorn getting a much needed buff, Axe/Axe +AxE/warhorn to be the new meta for PVE warrior?
---
I can, and these few cosmetic changes barely scratch the surface.
---
I won't even start about condi thief clownfiesta...
---
Was his appartment rent controlled?
---
they are available for karma *after* an event chain that is rarely done and requires a few people. yep, it tells me most are not making legendaries. shards are not abundant in casual pve which is where most of the playerbase resides. there is no information of any relevance that i am excluding.
---
You'll get another opportunity at the Mad King's Raceway!
---
OK.  I'll bite.  How in the world did bloodlust kill a guild?
---
LMFAO since when is doing temple events not casual PvE?  Boy, pull your head out.
---
Aren't the minion traits still intact?
---
They just give you more toughness with the update.
---
I like how scourge has no way to unsummon a sand shade once one has been put out.  Like if the scourge wanted to use his skills around his own character, they wouldn't be able to after the shade is out.
---
Also the changes to death magic.. yet no minion controls.. [???](https://i.imgur.com/sHiW7hE.png)
---
/u/NeroWrought See told you :P
---
Its the change that means the player is no longer a walking shade that annoys me.
---
It should be the real animation
---
I think the sand shade changes are terrible for pve.
---
As u/BippotheHippo mentioned support Firebrand is one possible support coming to my mind aswell, although it's support is mostly melee/short range and in a cone in front of the Charakter. So be sure to position yourself correctly. 
---
For the more laid back, range aoe style you can aim for scourge, share barrier, throw in some wells of blood, grab every downy + bring them up in no time and laugh in free XP.
---
But it would be nice if you mention your almost killed main, so we can exclude it from our suggestions ;)
---
best melee damage option for condi rev is a combination of mace/axe + shortbow.  Considering we have literally 0 other condi melee options and they spent a literal year+ buffing shortbow on rev intentionally to make it PvE viable I _highly_ doubt they'll nerf it at all
---
I love your art style! I keep looking at this drawing and it so nice to just look at!
---
Well groups for those two fractals are usually shaping the fractal meta, so I think FB + Ren being consistently picked over Druid is very much important as it means FB &gt; Druid in fractal scene.
---
That only leaves Raids, and for that I can say it depends on the group. FB + Ren is still very good - meta even when looking at speedclears. I suppose those that ask for Druids are pugs that are old fashioned, or they may like Chrono (which Druid is a foil to) or they want Frost Spirit but there isn't a good Soulbeast. 
---
What Druid + Chrono may possibly have over FB + Rev at this point are portals, pulls, 10 man might and 10 man 5% damage through Spirit. What FB + Rev has over Druid + Chrono is ridiculously easy boon access (noone needs to stand in Wells, 1 button push for most boons instantly), much superior self dps (which make up for Frost Spirit in fractal scene) and much superior healing and sustain (Druid is arguably one of the worst healers). 'Redistribute' any of the advantages Druid + Chrono has to this comp and you will have the strongest support duo barring none.
---
Had a guy playing necro with Fractal god title, people who bitch about someone playing some off meta class expect runs to finish in 30 minutes
---
Don't you dare diss my boy Engie when you can't even pull 10k DPS
---
On contrary note I also take DH because CM's
---
+ GS autoattack evade was removed and counterattack now has an additional key press. Overall, a weird update for a ranger.
---
Considering NCsoft's actions this year, neither does mindlessly buying skins.
---
We waited once or twice 4 months. So yes, I can imagine.
---
He didn't, it was writer's interpretation.
---
This is coming from someone who hasn't played in ages and has no clue of masteries, but at least back in the day you could make a pretty nasty support out of Engineer. Probably still can. (elixirs n' stuff)
---
We're told to expect a lot of "cthulu" for the first two episodes, which is very much DSD territory. So its more that we establish the threat first, which then helps justify some parties aligning with Jormag in later installments.
---
I never knew about this, damn it makes reading the patch notes so much better, thanks!
---
Just because you can buy something doesn't mean you have to get it that way. I'm glad I can convert my gold to gems and spend it for items from gemstore.
---
Maybe putting skins in loot list would make content more populated and rewards could change weekly. OK, this would be interesting for me, because it's nice to feel rewarded, but as I know this game, Anet would just make another RNG box with 95% trash loot.
---
But for someone (unlucky) like me, I would faster get gold and buy something than loot it.
---
Mirage is so much fun. Especially with the +50% endurance on weapon swap you aint getting hit by nothing and axes are everywhere.
---
Clear telegraphs does not mean giant AoE though. It just means that you can see an attack coming and not having it be obstructed by visual noise. Matthias hadouken is a very clear telegraph for example, a random trashmobs autoattack is absolutely not.
---
This game very heavily relies upon single core cpu speed, try out d912pxy for gw2 as it takes some of the stress and puts it onto your gpu, most people see a dramatic increase in frames.
---
Every elder dragon has has champions.. The nornbear, the shatterer, lupicus, tequatl, great destroyer, death branded shatterer, glint... Etc
---
&gt; I can't quite put in to words how silly and hilarious it is when they talk about how it breaks the lore when all it does is back up the lore
---
You've completely missed the point of OP. I agree with him to an extent. If you asked a random GW2 player (one that haven't played GW1) who's in the right, Charr or humans, most of them would probably say the Charr because of how the conflict is portrayed in GW2.
---
When Bangar is whining about Ascalonians wearing their fur as armor, he conveniently leaves out the part of "after we've invaded their kingdom and slaughtered like 80% of it". None of the characters call him out on it of course, and this always happens. We are getting the Charr narrative, but it is *never* disputed ingame by any of the characters so most people probably just roll with it. 
---
The portrayal is controversial, not the characters/conflict/history.
---
character settings to max medium if you want decent performance in populated areas
---
I would like it if Jormag and Bangar would actually be working together instead of "corruption" or "raarrrggh evil" characterization. It'd be great if the charr group would accept Jormag's brand willingly for power.
---
Welcome to guild wars 2
---
But there's one main issue in pvp modes. All that health is worth nothing, if you can't protect it.
---
Dodge the first 15k hit, Dodge the second one as well, well now you have to eat the next one, cause there's no defenses left.
---
Then some small hits and you are dead. Health only mitigates very limited amounts of dmg, while evades and blocks can mitigate infinite amounts of dmg.
---
Even 2000 would already be a huge improvenent since thats higher than the base health of 2/3th of the classes
---
Noone plays bloodmagic in wvw because it's super bad
---
All of these stories are inspired by the real world arms race. One nation has a nuke, every other nation wants a nuke so the end result is mutually assured destruction.
---
Right now the Commander has a nuke and the other races (the charr in the current story but inevitably others will rationally have the same concern) are concerned about their own survival if the Commander uses his/her nuke on them.
---
tfw there's noone to raid with
---
Hey clown notice how my post didnt criticise how you play. 
---
Play as you wish, but proudly proclaiming you refuse any meta and dont care about performance whenever meta / team play / your own performance is OK.
---
But if you then get upset any of those skills change for no reason other than "it changed" then you're just against progress / change for the sake of it.
---
Players choose to play random builds that are 10x less effective than something meta? ITS MY CHOICE AND PERFORMANCE DOESNT MATTER!!!! ok sure.
---
Anet changes anything about any of these builds with negligible impact on its overall performance? OMG ANET MY MEME BUILDS PERFORMANCE WENT DOWN BY 0.01%. 
---
Bonus points if they later whine about direct consequences of a lack of balance.
---
Ascalon has a settlement in Kryta as well as Ebonhawke. There is still a descendant from the Kyrtan royal bloodline in Ebonhawk. Ironically, Grothmar Valley is visually almost identical to the most beautiful parts of pre-Searing Ascalon so even the landscape of Ascalon (autumnal leaves with a tinge of snow and gentle farmlands outside of a fortified castle) is preserved in GW2.
---
I actually think it's likely intentional - there are so many parallels with pre-searing Ascalon, even the boss fight at the end of the episode mirrors the ice elementals from the tower near Foible's Fair.
---
Because they were looking for a reason to quit and then used use the introduction of bloodlust as an excuse. People in general have a hard time just quitting, they need to tell themselves there is a specific reason for it.
---
So what that he did? He only does educated guesses.
---
I don't know any but you can view your bank and inventories in  [gw2efficiency](https://gw2efficiency.com) and if you click on any item, you get a menu that points you to the wiki where you can read what this item is used for and get an idea if you need it. That is not exactly what you want, but it is a lot more comfortable than memorizing item names ingame and typing them into google one by one.
---
Because the last thing these need is a nerf.
---
I feel ANet is just terminally afraid of reworks (or understaffed for them!) and hence doesn't want to accept that major parts of some classes and specs need a walk back to the drawing board, not just some number changes.
---
Now, what they did here had some potential on paper. But they're inexperienced with reworking specs. I don't blame them for that, they just never really did it in the years of GW2 so far. But it still means that ultimately they shouldn't attempt to fix up their slightly-reworked Scrapper, they should take the lessons learned from this rework and do a "proper" one. Maybe even think about elite specs in the context of their classes as a whole, first.
---
True dat.
---
You have a good CPU for running the game, so you should be cracking more that 30fps.  
---
What speed is your RAM?  
---
What resolution are you playing at/if you turn down your resolution does your FPS improve dramatically?
---
Check out my tips in [this recent thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/d8ddfk/consistently_lower_fps_recently/); looks like that player resolved their issues by rolling back a recent Windows update.
---
Scourge: Shade skills no longer affect the area around the scourge while they have a shade present in the world. Increased the number of targets affected by shade skills from 3 to 5.
---
RIP scourge
---
I don't think they are afraid of reworks. That's what got us into this mess in the first place. But they absolutely hate backing down on changes. They will rather go though brimstone and fire than to admit "yeah maybe this wasn't such a good idea". That they are doing anything to that effect with impact savant for example (yet theres still a health loss just so they don't show weakness) is a miracle. However look what they did about the whole function gyro thing. "Oh yeah f-gyros blowing up instantly is actually intended, so we just added that to the description, sorry for the confusion. Now get back to holo!".
---
As for increasing the damage on function gyro as if that was the problem with it....
---
https://imgur.com/a/g6tGY
---
Keep in mind the date of that thing.
---
It's still good on certain raid bosses, especially those that need a strong tank. So quite a lot of them. 
---
Power chrono is one of the strongest dps classes.
---
It has fallen out of favour in fractals as a support class but its still viable when combined with a druid, it also allows some cheesy skips with blinks and portals If you know how to do Them.
---
What's this "underwater" you speak of?
---
But the humans who lived there had nothing to do with the war that happened a thousand years ago, nor the the people of Orr and Kryta. The Charr started the war in question. Humans held Ascalon longer than the Charr too. 
---
Of of the victims of the searing and the Charr invasion most were just random innocent farmers and citizens. Plus burning people alive or eating them weren't exactly necessary. They even kept their tradition of human slavery until pretty much the start of GW2, yet these are never held against them in the main story while the Charr get to gloat about humans all the time.
---
People aren't salty because they nerfed Chrono, they're salty because instead of nerfing how strong it is, they nerfed how fun it is. They made chronomancer actively annoying, clunky, and unfun to play. 
---
Personally, I couldn't care less whether chrono's "best in slot" or whatever numbers they put out. If something's not good enough for raids, at least I could have fun with it in open world or wherever, but that's unfortunately not the case this time.
---
Technically yes, we effectively became neutal as the Pact is a military group of the Orders combined. The Orders still exsist on their own as normal, just work as part of the pact.
---
Its why you have specific Pact soliders but also the individual members of the Orders.
---
Scourge in PvP gets removed for no reason.
---
For everything else, these a Mastercard
---
Don't mind this too much, but are your fps locked to 30 in the options?
---
Here I was thinking Big Hat Logan from Dark Souls.
---
I still find it confusing why Fractals/Raids/Strikes don't have better rewards. If you want players to do that content often then the carrot has to be great. There is so much fashion in this game and attaching some of that to those modes would give them so much life.
---
Just a quick reminder Boon thief only works if you can steal the [Plasma](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Detonate_Plasma)if you can't the build does not work.
---
So either you are already a raider trying to improve the amount of classes you can play or you don't know how and where the Boon-thief works yet.
---
If my first guess is correct: you can buy the gear at the raid vendor in the Aerodrome.If my second guess is correct: I highly recommend you to gear something else first.
---
^(If my second guess is correct and you don't want to listen: As people mentioned before LS3 maps for ascended trinkets/backpiece and VB for exo armor. for weapons i recommend the PoF elite specialization collections which is a cheap way to get ascended weapons which have harrier as selectable stat.)
---
Coming back from a short 3-4 month break from the game, what's good now on T4 fractals? Are the quickbrand&amp;Alacragade builds viable (as in people let you play with them in their parties, not if they are good) and what dps options are good? I prefer DPS classes that (while don't deal as much damage) are a bit more survivable, I remember having a bad time with staff ele back in the day, is the sword ele build more safe?
---
I'm already geared for power and have been running a few different thief power builds for the longest time and just wanted to try other options. I didn't know about the Plasma part though. Do you know if the healing build has the same limitation? Don't know how viable either of them are but I saw them both on Snow Crows website.
---
I have been heavily criticizing the game for this aspect too. But since LS4 you can't really complain. They are adding more and more gameplay-earnable skins. I think 4-5 new skins via gameplay per episode is the max they can do if they want to make money from the game considering that their best Products just simply put need to go into gemstore to make money.
---
You cant do dodge jump though.
---
New to the game, could someone ELI5?
---
Didn't follow up on the changes for Mesmer because I am more playing my Thief lately. What did they change exactly?
---
&gt;AMA
---
What's the reason for your AMA
---
Just have to burn up another shade charge.  Rather than just having it count against the one you already summoned.  It would basically count 2 charges to do 1 thing you wanted originally.
---
they said episode 1 will be released in 2019, so safe bet november, cause october is halloween and december is windersday. Even if it is not 1 of novemeber, it will probably be the first 2 weeks of november, except they want to take more time to polish the content.
---
Do the personnal story, at some point you've to choose between the 3 orders of Tyria : Vigils (armed forces) / Priory (knowledge) / Shadow (intel). 
---
If you want to understand, choose Shadow. Caution : this may contains feels.
---
Tragically, the things Chrono did well coincided with the things Chrono did fun. In nerfing or removing them, Support Chrono has become, as someone else said, clunky and joyless.
---
It is still far from unplayable, and still perfectly meta in raids and elsewhere, as Support, Power DPS, or Condi DPS. This merely speaks to how busted the class was to begin with. The only reasons to not go full Chrono at level 80 are if you hate clone-proprietary toolbelt skills, or you just love Mirage, both super legit reasons.
---
No Sieran reference in Season 2/HoT has me sad.  If there's not a Forgal reference in the new story, I'mma be mad.  Tybalt gets way too much love for what he is, IMO.
---
GS aa evade was being exploited by cast-cancel-recast for longer evade.
---
and lich #4?
---
Fresh level 80 ranger new player. Currently playing free to play just to dip my toes as I am obviously starting to notice some of the restrictions being 80 now. Anyway my question is what is the road of progression for a fresh 80 f2p player. Will likely buy the game of course after I play a bit at cap since I already know some of you will say "buy it" as an answer. What should I start doing, where and how can I get good gear sets?
---
Very interesting!
---
Galaxy brain ^
---
Doesn't dragonfall give you full diviner's from collections?
---
I still don't get the changes. Why the hate-boner for Illusion of Life, for example?
---
Also, it doesn't matter if they add minor QoL improvements to skills if they are ultimately useless. Chrono is still dead and unfun in PvE, relegated to the gamer-girlfriend buffer species of players.
---
And your alternative is..?
---
100% agreed. Not to mention overrated. Hell, you can see the obvious Tybalt bias in something as small as the minis of them you can get. Tybalt costs more tokens than Sieran, Forgal and Trehearne combined.
---
Recording and show casing all the different spots he can actually hide might be a bit more helpful; you looked in a spot he'll never stand in, and glossed over the not easy to see spots (and didn't mention the ones around the cooking event).
---
Your first mistake was assuming they use reason.
---
Why power scourge? If you wanted to run necro tank you would just run Trailblazer with Parasitic Contagion. It will still be trash, because tanking in this game require active defenses like evades and blocks to be effective, not just stat checking the damage source.
---
&gt; Oh look, despite a whole bunch of feedback saying that the Detection Pulse change was shoving a skill that is literally useless in all PvE situations onto the Scrapper's tool belt, they still went ahead with it because people want it in PvP. 
---
There is no feedback, only toxicity. You probably didn't ask nicely enough.
---
/s
---
That high neck would make for a good Cyberpunk cosplay
---
there is lots of reason for that.
---
When i try to open menu's before the game fully loads, it bugs them. so yes, a bug indeed.
---
Honestly i'm a bit let down at this because I really liked the idea of Jormag getting waayyyy too personal at us. Hope it's still a thing that will happen in t he saga
---
I'm new, I don't get what's the appeal of the home nodes? Like, is it one bush back at home instance? How is that good if you can just... go to grothmar and locate a bush within 30 seconds?
---
Now I feel a bit proud of myself.
---
Can you DM me what is the story in reference? I've completed the story but did not choose Shadow or did, and probably did not care for what ever happened. I don't feel like starting it again.
---
One day they'll buff Guardian's Longbiw abilities...
---
Yeah i noticed the potion bug too ,and i though if i was dump or missing something
---
Firebrand and Renegade which, together, can provide permanent boons if they use diviner’s gear. There are also strong healing variants of each build. 
---
They are currently the meta for fractals and are quite common in raids as well
---
Still have him as my mini :')
---
hmm weird comparison, but i’m gonna try: 
---
Druid: Ivern, Maokai, Sona
---
probably nowhere close, but has some of the animals are your friend mentality, snares with vines and shines through AOE heals while having good sustain.
---
I tried it - gained 0 FPS on my rig (Ryzen 3800X, 16Gb DDR4, GTX1070). I still had the same FPS with big drops when turning the camera fast. The thing with "user" created stuff is that when it doesn't work or when it messes something up - you can't be mad at the devs or request a "quality product" (remember the initial versions that didn't load textures or shaders correctly?)
---
IF Anet decides to jump to another API, they would need to 100% test it and stand behind any bug or crashes ready to fix them asap. At this point, I really think that's not gonna happen taking the age of the game and the fact they've had huge layoffs recently into consideration.
---
On the other hand - I could live with wonky FPS if they only revamped the general visual cancer with all the friggin eye-popping colors and FX that are all over the place. Here you are, enjoying the serenity of Queensdale when a wild SPACE EYEPOPPIN GRIFFON made of million stars flies by you followed by a ball of pure white light that you can only guess is a infusion-stacked player, blinding even the dead Elder dragons that are on the other side of the planet!
---
Ancient engine made of spaghetti code. Noone can  really run it with stable framerate at ultra settings. Hell, in some case it dips even with the lowest settings.
---
Ehh, I think the dialogue could have been a bit better considering this was aimed at Bangar. Feels like they added some stuff purely to deceive the playerbase which makes it fit less well. In my opinion.
---
I did that lol but then I change it after someone told me about it😂
---
I'm more amazed that you forgot soraka, as she and druids are bout celestial themed supports with AoE heals that use staffs.
---
Time to get the karma and other account stuff?
---
You mean factoring in the total value from them you get each run for gold/h?
---
Kinda wish this information was out there BEFORE I bought it from the damn NPC.
---
This is the first.
---
different style this time?
---
still look nice tho
---
You know, it kinda saddens me when you don't see NPCs reminiscing about this uppity Priory researcher who made their world just a little bit brighter, or telling a young'un how there is also the Dolyak spirit, you just don't see 'em often these days
---
I'll do it.
---
Okay, while I understand there is a lot of pain in playing chrono before the nerf, that after, isn't this a bit to doom and gloom? Even with moving you can place wells in the correct spots, shield 5 still exists, and while pugs might have gotten worse, with a little organization a chrono can still easily keep up with the team. I still haven't escaped chrono jail, even with multiple firebrands and renegades joining. As some others pointed out: chrono has been taken down a couple of notches, but still is very competent and doesn't perform worse than the firebrigade, instead working in tandem with them instead of towering over them and limiting the use of the firebrigade.
---
In my experience, thinking ahead and planning the chrono buffs instead of sitting still and pressing buttons made chrono a bit more interesting, and on the whole, the nerf in power was neccesary to bring chrono down to meta levels of power, not meta defining. Then again, thats my personal opinion.
---
I just wanted to shitpost that PvP was decent because this board whines about it at every mention.
---
Unique in name? What alternative is there for Soulcleave's Summit? Or Banners? Or Spirits? Or Explode Plasma?
---
These can absolutely change up gameplay. Soulcleave's Summit let's you stay in and DPS Gors more during the retal phase. Rebound let's you skip movement on Xera buttons or avoid the need for shields for CA clap. 
---
Every profession should absolutely be able to dps and support and they should be viable as legitimate options. That won't happen without boons being distributed more widely and that necessitates a degree of homogeneity of opportunity.
---
They got criticized for selling armor in the shop while not giving us armor sets that are earnable ingame. At this point I'd welcome gemstore armor sets if it meant no more outfits, plus we are getting ingame obtainable armor sets again.
---
i talk about armor-skins ............ like they did before they shit out the useless outfit shit.........
---
and i don't care if they get criticized for selling us cool skins, they are a company for fuck sake they need to make money somehow .......
---
My guess is November gap is an event (similar to boss rush) and next episode isn't until January. I just don't see them delivering story chapters on a less than 3 month cadence, it's just not reasonable based on their track record. Maybe they will set a new standard with "sagas" but I doubt it.
---
well you cant do more than the first 19 fractals without ascended gear
---
I don't see anything exciting at all in here. Episode 1 will be short and story just gets boring. And we won't get any REAL content. Probably same hearts or whatever.
---
Truth. I've mained Chrono since release and that need is what finally made me stop playing this game altogether. 4000+ hours and I'm just... Done. Enjoying other games now and I doubt I'll ever go back to regularly playing GW2. Maybe I'll speed through the living story once this arc is complete, but I'm certainly never spending another dime on it and I would definitely have been considered a "whale" (thousands of dollars spent).
---
best post this year
---
Because people are obviously buying them. Just like random mount licences, keys and other stuff that people on reddit/forums make a big fuss about.
---
It's not only raids, wvw and pvp that have the vocal minority which is unhappy about something.
---
I was already running Corrupter's Fervor on my solo roaming build, with 10% damage reduction food.  People complain about the "30k Ranger burst" but do nothing to negate it.  My build is only weak against heavy condition spam but most folks are these days.
---
My planned scenario:  Use the Rise shout which has the same effect as Prot, while ramping up the 25 stacks to get the boon, and those arrows turn into spitballs.  Conditions are hella easy to apply from a Necro.
---
The amount of gemstone and chest skins I see is staggering, especially the incredibly popular ones that are rare drops like the stag.
---
..plz
---
But that's exatly that. Bangar thinks that after all this killing, we can easily also kill a race with finger in nose. And he believes that it would be charrs being eradicated, so he tries to level the odds by getting some big guns on his side.
---
Don't people on this sub keep saying the gemstore team is a different one that doesn't take away any resources from the other teams ? 
---
Which way reddit man
---
imagine being in KISS
---
It gives them revenue which will be invested in the game to fund development and Outfits take less time to create because they don't need to look at other gear to prevent most clipping between armour like shoulders etc.
---
IIRC ArenaNet said they need 9 months for a single Armour set rig to every race and every gender. I would imagine Outfits take considerably less time.
---
not in game because anet dont  care about guild since abandoning guild missions
---
I thought my 220 to 280 ping was bad for doing the twitchy shit in this game.
---
I do mean scourge. I didn't mention it because I didn't want to turn this into a qq or balance thread. I'm really down that they're murdering my favorite spec and wanted to find something new and fun to start fresh with. I understand its not "dead", but they're changing it into something I won't even remotely enjoy playing anymore :( 
---
That said, fire brand does sound fun. The conal aspect of their skills sounds neat, because at least I can stand a bit behind the melee blob to feel a bit safer. The low health is a bit scary though. What do you personally enjoy about fire brand?
---
Ooh, I see. I wondered if there was a direct reference to Cthulhu. Lovecraftian could mean a lot of things, not specific to DSD, but intriguing anyway.
---
Thanks for the suggestion! I heard you can spam f1 tome endlessly with the trait that refreshes it. Is that pretty satisfying to play? I really like things that refresh on kill. I have a mirage with runes of tormenting that has sigil of endurance in the weapon slots to refill endurance after every kill so it gets to spam dodge endlessly which is pretty fun. It's a little one dimensional gameplay wise though so I do tire of it sometimes.
---
Even if they have a separate team, I am sure some resources are shared between the teams,  like the 3d artist, the concept artists and so on..
---
I used to build PCs for a living, and had access to pretty much every component on the market for about 5 years. Above a certain threshold GPU speed doesn't seem to matter at all, the 1650 is well above that so that isn't your issue.  The biggest bottleneck in this game is single core CPU speed. The absolute best performance I've seen in this game was on an 8700k running at 5.1Ghz with a GTX 1080 and 16gb of DDR4 memory, and even that rig couldn't hold 50 fps in Lions Arch, however 60fps was pretty consistent everywhere else except events with a large amount of players.  I have heard the dx12 mod helps a lot especially on faster CPUs, but haven't tried it myself.  That said your I7 should be able to put out more than 30fps assuming it's actually boosting up to 4.5ghz, you can make sure it's not going into power saving mode in the windows power settings, just set everything to max performance.
---
I'm confused, I saw another comment saying they nerfed thieves as well, but what did they nerf?  It looked like straight buffs and fixes in that section.
---
I think I prefer the old style. It felt so digitally dorky, in a good way, and matched the narrative well.
---
If you want easy CA, yoy could run spirit and just heal them xD. Work has good has healing other players.
---
Just referencing isekai in general (long running ones like Deathmarch that are still going), if you mean "that time I got reincarnated as a slime", yeah it ended with chapter 249, it was a good read though. I do need to pick up the light novel version at some point to see how the story differs.
---
Haaa I wish monthlies were still a thing, it'd be a good way to encourage us to redo all these awesome aventures! Even though some can be hard with high ping I get it
---
Hope Anet see your post then.
---
Mudfish reduces mine quite a bit
---
Interesting you replied to me enjoying firebrand you probably didn’t mean me haha, but firebrand is currently my favorite class to play and I usually am a chrono main. But they butchered my class too so I know how you feel ^^ 
---
I love firebrand because even if you play support (quickness’s viper) your damage output is still insane and dont even start talking about full condi firebrand. I never used to aim for top dps spots in raids, but with firebrand it’s so easy, even on burst power damage bosses. Other than that you have soooo much aegis, resistance, condi cleanses, stability, quickness of course, CC, pulls. It’s not as much of a hard carry as scourge. Nothing is. But it brings soooo much utilities with the tomes. Just carefully read through them and know what does what and you’ll love it.
---
kinda pointless,but you have nice voice =)
---
Met a KISS player yesterday, all shiny and with the WvW backpack. He tagged Matriarch once and then proceeded to die and afk for the rest of the fight.
---
Bloodlust destroyed a fair GvG match due to the original stat values given and it was impossible to count on keeping it even. Remember back then there was no place to go other than windmill.
---
The guild's entire main focus at the time was GvG and competitive play....so both GMs quit along with 50% of the guild.
---
You were in the guild?
---
&gt; Death Nova scaling off your damage now is huge. For Reaper that means Lich Form 4 will be adding ~6.5 gravediggers worty of damage in Death Novas, so already it looks very valuable for burst fights. Might be able to use Rise as well if timed correctly.
---
very unlikely to be meta reaper build, because other traitlines are vastly overpowering death magic and death nova even after the change. but it will definitely be a buff for core necro.
---
also where did you get that 6.5 gravediggers worth of damage :D 
---
unbuffed death nova tooltip dmg is 582dmg, increased by 60% it's ~932. gravedigger tooltip is 3707. if we have all lich minion explode thats 932*8 = 7456 death nova dmg. so like 2 gravediggers
---
that being said i will definitely try out the burst rotas with the trait, but even if it came out super nice, we would really need lich form cd reduction. currently if your party is fast enough, your lich wont be off cd on last phases of skorvald, enso, arkk
---
Thanks for this, finished it last night with help from the wiki and I must say that you have way better screenshots than some of the stuff on the wiki I had to use.   
---
Some of those screenshots (Coin #14 for example) on the wiki are confusing as hell without the minimap shown. Hopefully someone in the wiki community updates those with your versions. +1 OP
---
lich is an absolute beast in a team fight. Minion storm puts immense pressure on the enemy, especially ones they begin going down and lose mobility
---
2 mins with taco XD
---
I can understand why they did it, it does introduce slightly more counterplay against Scourges in WvW/PvP modes. But it doesn't really do enough in WvW for the changes to matter aside from some clunkiness and slight counterplay (balanced by low-counterplay 10 man ranged spikes), and instead weakens the class/pisses people off in PvE or roaming WvW/PvP players.
---
Though I agree Nov is most likely, they did release HoT at the same time as Halloween way back when... There were issues they knew about with HoT's releases and that was their reason, I'm just pointing out that a release during a festival isn't beyond the realm of possibilities.
---
im getting TERA vibes here.
---
&lt;3
---
With a lvl 80 character a lot of fights and exploring become trivial, for that reason i will always suggest that you level up your first character normally (doesnt take long anyway) and save your booster in case you'd like to try a different class later on.
---
Thanks , yeah I cover a lot of stuff from super easy to harder stuff, thanks for the feedback.
---
Why does this even need a guide...
---
Yes this is actually pretty standard. The first Time loading new textures with d912pxy you will have those slow load times. Should be fine after that.
---
Just a little video as an explanation, I do videos on all kinds of stuff from easy to hard..
---
&gt; It would have been even better if in a grandmaster you could share it with a group. 
---
I like the idea but this might be overkill. But a nice idea for support necro as it would finally have a third traitline to pick. (I mean Soul Reaping almost offer nothing to pure Heal Scourge and was only picked because there is no better option. And I think almost nobody uses the optimal variant with Curses, as the Gear just is too special and useless on other classes, while the magi or harrier gear was usable on tempest at least. + If your team is good enough that your support scourge can play condi hybrid you don't need a support scourge at all...)
---
Pros: you see the beautiful new areas sooner. Cons: you will have trouble playing your class, the story and probably the game itself, too.
---
I'd play through in the following way: play the core game - &gt;Play the first pof mission and get the raptor-&gt; Play through hot content - &gt; play through pof :)
---
People also say that when ingame rewards are lacking again. Or when a big update comes out and there's more than triple the amount of skins and the like that came with the content added to the gemstore. Just fyi, we're only 6 outfits away from hitting the same amount of armor sets availabe to players.  
---
In the end, I get what you're saying, but they could easily slow down on new outfits and create new armor sets inbetween. That is, if outfits weren't an easy cashcow for them that they probably will never give up.
---
Warrior main, loved to pull out the Thief from time to time. Granted I don't think I've played the game in a year and solidly for probably another year on top of that but yeah, gotta keep this laptop lasting and not a heaping pile of scrap that any Iron Legion Charr would get itchy fingers over.
---
Warrior, big and simple, also versatile, although RIP combat banners, used to love running the last personal story dungeon of Orr with mine when it was still open to the public. Can mix and match traits, skills and weapons to flavourful effect which was what drew me to GW2 in the first place. All classes have this but the fact a typically standard warrior class can pull this off is great testament to making the classes all fun. In short, **GREATSWORD SMASH, HAMMER SMASH.**
---
Thief, fast, elegant and vicious. The Thief weapon skill combos never get old. Never. Fun and fair class in pvp too, you know what you're getting yourself into by using one. Very squish but very mobile, you can definitely play this class wrong but there's enough choice to really go exploring with it.
---
You wrote something I want to address though, and let me be honest. This is an MMO, you're ALWAYS going to be missing out on something, and that's OK. You're not paying a sub for this wonderful game so remember that too, if you need to stop from time to time and ask yourself if you have had your money's worth to stop yourself from going crazy than do it.
---
One day necro's will get a damn pet window!
---
Why make another website when you can do those things in the wiki. Sooner or later it will always be on the wiki either way so why not centralize all of the efforts into one instead of just having spread out resources that go offline or are not maintained after some time?!
---
Videos can be posted on a youtube channel, Guides and locations of coins or anything can be on the wiki.
---
Life Force scales with Vitality, do that would have been silly OP. Building around a Protection buff, as you said, would have made it more viable. Maybe they don't want Death in group play.
---
Level *at least* one character manually. It doesn't take that long and does provide a lot of insight into how the mechanics of the game work. If you start immediately at lvl80, you will be severely overpowered on many maps even with dynamic leveling.
---
Scourges will be pissed lol , warriors on the other hand oh my ....
---
I'm always excited by them.
---
It's funny you say that, cause I only come back to the game for the story. :P
---
Watching this, I'm looking around for Scourge shades and Tome 3 reflect bubbles, it got me thinking, this is what it must be for the younger generation of Star Wars fans who grew up thinking that Han shot 2nd.
---
Use the booster on second character that will be focused od pvp/fractals etc.
---
Who needs a guide for this?
---
You never know.
---
iirc the tooltip scaling currently (and the entire trait) is quite buggy. I was going off wiki skill co-effecients which have Death Nova at .75 and Gravedigger at 3.0. Death Nova also pulses twice which is were I derived that number, though I will admit I am unsure if it is poison only or the direct damage portion as well post-patch.
---
At (8 x .75 x 2(?) x 1.6)/3 = 6.4 Gravediggers worth of damage. If it doesn't pulse you can half that number.
---
As for Carapace Stacks with Lich 4 + Blood Fiend + possibly Rise you are looking at  16 + 2 to 12 + 5 Carapace stacks with the Minion trait. Also worth noting Rise could actually be a strong DPS skill especially on fights with adds you can precast it on before burn phases.
---
I speak from a more Raid-centric view though keep in mind. You probably have a better understanding of Reaper burst windows/scenarios in Fractals/CMs than me, so I won't comment too much on that regard.
---
+1 to this idea. just build the wiki pages. Dulfy did everything on separate website for **money**
---
Met a player who was cosplaying as Tybalt with a mini of Tybalt and it was down to the T how they looked. He would go around asking if people wanted apples and mailed it to them. Holding the one he gave me in my shared inventory spot.
---
cleanse - power cleanse  
---
continuum split - chronobreak  
---
ice wall - crystallize  
---
signet of fire - ignite  
---
blink - flash  
---
barrage- cannon barrage  
---
why do you have to pretend?
---
I just used the wiki to help out with finding the last few coins on Grothmar, and you know what? It was just as good, if not better than Dulfy's guides (some of which have since become outdated).
---
So also +1, and the wiki will always be there and updated very regularly.
---
&gt; x 1.6)/3
---
what does this stand for? gravedigger coefficient and scaling?
---
you can't compare them like that, utility/trait skills use different weapon power (690) whereas gs has 1100. just compare the tooltips separately like i did and there you have it.
---
i just went to test the death nova if it pulses direct dmg twice or just once, and it doesn't even deal direct dmg, seems like a bug xD it ticks the poison but i dont even get in combat because of no direct dmg. meanwhile corrosive poison cloud doesnt even have direct dmg but puts in combat from just applying condis. w e i r d
---
rise is bad for death's carapace if there's only you and boss. 2 minions. might as well run the bone minions so they dont expire. lich form minions shouldn't even count for death's carapace theorycrafting, they are disposable af. we should think about upkeeping perma 30 stacks for 300 power. and even if we could it would still be worse than spite/soul reap/reaper lines
---
skills so generic you could put them in almost any genre
---
I think the benefits of leveling start to dry out as you approach lvl 60. Since you already have a little history with the game, you could both boost "safe" characters for various lvl 80 content, and go through the natural leveling process and core story with other characters. There are big gaps between some personal story chapters, so you'll either need to know what to go for in the meantime, or risk getting bored with exploration.
---
I wouldn't recommend going for the raptor too soon, storming through maps can quickly turn them to just random fields that are wasting your time. While I don't think spending first few weeks primarily exploring is the best way for people like you to "start", it's still good to actually experience the world. Glider mostly helps you avoid unnecessary deaths, so I wouldn't be too concerned about it taking anything away from the core experience.
---
In my opinion boosting mainly trades story cohesion for earlier access to good farms. You can hit many good spots during normal leveling, most certainly putting you in a better position to start farming once you reach lvl 80 by merit, but I'd at least strongly recommend boosting if you ever start doubting if this is the right game for you. You'll end up with more than enough different ways to speed level more characters later, so I wouldn't worry too much about spending that/those free boosts.
---
By "safe" I'm referring to classes you'll likely want to have in your roster for utility anyway, like mesmer or ranger.
---
All armors, weapons, backpacks, trinkets, accessories, and amulets that allow stat selection will allow all choices for the regions of Tyria the account has acess to. F2P will have all Core Stats. Paided accounts will have Core, HoT, and PoF stats (since HoT is free with PoF).
---
Voicing agreement. Some players go as far as calling the personal story and your progress to Lvl80 the tutorial for the game. Compared to what you see getting to lvl80, the rest of GW2 is just HUGE. But you do need to go that way at least once, or you will quite likely just be lost.
---
Because to put in the extra effort you might as well do it for a little extra cash. 
---
The wiki option has always been there, it isn't the most appealing option though.
---
One of the biggest things you will miss are the waypoints you need to get around. You can use the level 80 boost to try out your character while limited to a map, and revert afterwards. You can also try level 80 builds on PvP.
---
I don't think playing from 1-80 will necessarily get you playing optimally, and you can get the same amount of training with access to most skills by going through old zones (which are somewhat scaled for better rewards to your level 80). I don't really buy that "you must level 1-80 to train yourself properly" argument that much anymore - you can do it as a level 80, but you have to dedicate the effort to go through the motions to learn your class, at least by doing the storyline for your character and doing a few map completions.
---
Or you can just save your level 80 boost and use it as a level 80 PvE preview for any class.
---
I am hoping for a "Patch content overview" page on the wiki for each large patch, that show the new maps, item, skins, features, general changes...etc
---
[Like this](https://www.wowhead.com/guides/patch-8-2-5-bfa-wow-overview)
---
Some days ago I mailed two exploits to anet (both have been there for years, elixir u and ranger gs aa) and they fixed both in this patch.
---
I'd say anet sees it as an exploit.
---
I wish the core story was a tutorial for the game, it cannot even serve that purpose :(
---
I dont mean to be rude but who are you are you a partner? Its just you say people keep asking you to step up and do something but unsure if I have seen any guides from you.
---
lol truth
---
yup some of them might be interested as well, true true ...
---
It is the best there is. At least it does give you an idea of your character story. What it is not good at really is giving hints about skills/mechanics. There is one event where you have to dodge, but that's it and I am not even sure it is mandatory.
---
I'd play PoF before HoT because HoT masteries are QoL changes while PoF ones are close to must-have for solo play and definitely must-have for anything done in squad. Springer is awesome for HoT maps and overall having mounts is much funnier than HoT masteries imo.
---
"Sneak peak" is a stealthy mountain.
---
PoF is a better tutorial imo. Core story doesn't require anything of note to succeed. Walk around, push skill buttons randomly, resurrect if you die by accidentally walking off a ledge.
---
SC is so dead, poor Roul has to solo for his weekly clears
---
not sure how or if people get rewarded for wiki contributions but the benefit of running a seperate website would be the possibility of ad revenue. if it becomes a popular website they might even be able to start a patreon or something like that. all in all i think its possible they would get more for their work if they did their own thing
---
Yeah just gathering. Sometimes 1node can give you up to 5chilis +-
---
I'm really impressed by this comprehensive breakdown, thank you.
---
[deleted]
---
Why even say that they are mechanically different, when you know that the same skills exist in these games?
---
Relatable
---
Or boost an alt to 80, finish the POF expansion 1st mission just to get a raptor mount+ its fast leap mastery. Then go back to your intended main for leveling. Its what i did, and what made the difference for me. Youll be able to use the mount to traverse the world much faster on a lvl 1 character. Just dont unlock the other mount with high jumps if you wanna enjoy the challenge of jumping puzzles.
---
Bangar has a lot of potential, so does this saga. We are getting an Ebon Vangaurd skin as reward in the new map, I'm hoping that we get a new one with each episode and hopefully it means that eventually the Vanguard will come into the story. I'm hoping that they will finally do Ascalon some justice too.
---
Looked into that thread and everyone, like you, is addressing it from an ingame perspective, "what would make sense in that situation". OP is talking more about how this looks from the outside, and that's the part I agree with. Charr never get called out on their bias, and in the main story/trailers all we ever hear is the Charr side. Without extra context (having played GW1 or read up on the lore) it's possible that a very significant portion of the playerbase doesn't even know the story from an Ascalonian POV, which removes quite a few layers and conflicts from the story. 
---
After 7 years of neglect Anet really should throw a bone to Ascalonians.
---
If you own path of fire:
---
Make an alt for a class you think is interesting but don't want to play right now, boost it to 80, unlock the raptor by doing the first path of fire mission, then level a character normally with the added convenience of using a mount. Learn the alt later, park it at a chest, whatever.
---
The boost gives some free 15 slot bags iirc which is nice. The gear it gives you isn't great though.
---
And while some people would say you're ruining it for yourself by unlocking the raptor early, the alternative is constantly spamming swiftness generating moves while running around. I don't miss those days. It doesn't take long to get tired of just how slow you move in relation to the size of the maps.
---
The wiki is the best plattform for the community, because its more up to date and has everything anyway.
---
I dont see why anybody would want to help OP make money with adds when doing this on the wiki makes so much more sense.
---
510 for the whole collection and 10-15 per is not "ridiculously expensive"
---
This is awesome. The griffon and raptor cam remind of helicopters following rally cars.
---
That's anet's way of saying abandon the heathen faith of Greatsword and return to the one true faith of good ol Bearbow ranger, start pulling arrows out of thin air and get one of the bears out of hibernation.

After which they invaded Kryta, Orr, and the Shiverpeaks. Pretty much everywhere with a border to Ascalon, really, fighting everyone and anyone they found there including the Norn.
---
It's interesting to me that people don't ever seem to stop and wonder why the war driven military dictatorship society have a homeland that apparently consists of pretty much everywhere.

In all situations, you used it at max range. There is never any reason to use hammer in melee range, swords do way more damage and staff does way more CC. It is *only* used to deal damage from long range.

Yes. Do you? I was a Sheriff's Deputy on Rural Southern Georgia as well as Kansas. Welfare country was my beat. Rural, dirt poor, living in dilapidated shacks and trailers. Mud plugging holes in the wall to keep the cold/heat out/in/whatever. Meals on Meals from two counties away, so the service was not daily. In addition to delivering papers for subpoenas and other court functions, you have a list of older folks to check on at least once a day to make sure they are okay. So, yeah. I've seen it.
---
Been overseas? Been to Africa? Or South America? Away from the touristy areas? I have.  Peace Corp before college. I went to Ethiopia (1995-1996). No comparison. None. American abject poverty is head and shoulders higher. I had to haul my own water 5 miles. I've heard other peace corp alumni laugh at me and I have heard some say as high as 10 miles, and one 'bragged' 15. Given what else he said he accomplished on the same day, I think he was lying, but I included it because you essentially asked for anecdotes. 
---
Water is 8 pounds to the gallon (about 3.5 kg). I'll just say it is a hard thing, learning how much you can carry for yourself and balancing ease of transport versus number of trips, and still teaching English and math as my mission.

You seem like a genuinely decent person who is appalled by the conditions that your fellow humanity lives in. I'm not attacking you. I think we can do better in this country, and I am appalled by the wealth disparity in our nation. I just feel context is important.

First thing we see on this page (apart from the clip) is a 3 headed water dragon that is not in the game.

just use fake data?
---
Yes, since the changes were supposed to be "WvW centric".
---
Collections tied to the pre-events as well as the world boss would be great. Have collection items drop in the chests for completing those events.
---
So no condi thief nerf? Noice, gonna enjoy PvP a lot
---
Exactly. What's the point of horizontal progression and basing performance on skill level rather than better gear when you dont need any skills for majority of the game?
---
I honestly don't understand why you would defend this collection. The weapons are cheap because they have been in the game since launch and they aren't that visually impressive either (except Jormag's Breath)
---
If you check the TP you'll see that there are between 30 to 50 weapons in stock for each skin. Why? Because there's no demand. Now imagine anet for some stupid reason makes some of those weapons relevant again, like a new collection or title or whatever. Or a new collection based on another world boss but with the exact same acquisition method. Well fuck the economy, because you can't reliable produce those weapons. The moment there's any demand for those weapons their price is going to sky rocket 
---
You're being fooled by the current numbers on the TP not realising that the method for acquiring these weapons is very poorly designed
---

Your welcome sir
---
So I’ve asked this question before on Reddit, and Gw2 Forums. People say that when they made armor people didn’t like that since armor should be acquired in game instead of gem store. That’s why they kept making outfits. IMO I hate that people complain too much for stupid stuff... I would wish they would continue making armor instead of outfits but that people who bitch are the ones not cash shopping... If only they brought back armor packs.
---
But 3-4 episodes now means two zones, not 3-4.
---
They might be bigger, but so far we don't know what "dynamic map growth" will look like. We also don't know if any of the releases will include fractals or raids, or what the spirit masteries will do.
---
Meanwhile I still have yet to get the drop to actually unlock the collection part of it.
---
what do you mean? there was never a mobile game
---
That is true, but I personally think too many maps is becoming an issue anyway, and we don't stick around in them long enough. I liked the idea of Silverwastes and Dry Top, we just stuck in each for TOO long. If we can get maps of their quality and size every 4 months still, and it has us stick around a bit longer, but we get the story faster as a result, I'm ok with that. Especially if they can get Strike Missions right going forward. The first is too easy, but I think it's fun, and worth stopping back in every day or so to do, and I don't have to wait for a timer to do it either.
---
haHAA ecksdee
---
This is why you should never just skim such things. Always check the writing and the associated guide (if there is one).
---
This was originally a mobile game that got scrapped. They used it's trailer for gw2
---
*Laughs in European*
---
You can make gold so easy in this game, one run of Dragonfall gives you almost enough (and usually enough) to buy two of the corrupted weapons.
---
Here are my thoughts. A new MMO something you never played will only have that one first time. The time were you know nothing and you experience it and learn it. As a veteran with over 15.000 hours of game time in GW2 and that is just on my main account i envy every new person because they have this infront of them.
---
Is it possible to boost. Sure it is. There are people who start this way and manage it. But this game is huge. The endgame is huge. the combat system is huge even though i am very sure that you comming from WvW at a first look at it will be like what are you talking about??? But put that aside, the combat system is bigger then wow and more engaging then wow, you just need to understand it.
---
Everybody can autoattack and then press other buttons and this will likely be your first impression. If you digg deeper in to the combat system you will find out that all weapons have their own skills. Some weapons have support, some condition (our debuffs) and some are for power. To tha we have weapon swap. So you do not only have one weapon set with 5 skills but 2 sets and you swap when ever you want. Then we have the skills on your right bar in which you can swap when ever out of combat and there by adjust to any fight. And then you have your f1-f5 (some have more some have less)
---
On top of that we have combofields. You pass a player who place a smokefield for him self, use a blast that you have on a weapon skill and now you suddenly are stealthed. Or a waterfield give you heal if you step in to it. If the person placing it is traited for it you can gain a lot of boons and cleanses just by stepping in to it. If you blast it you now get aoe heal for you and people around. 
---
And then you have the dodge and your personal heal. Your traits and your sigils/runes and stats which all have a synergy. You see now what i mean with digging in deep? Our combat can be pressing 1 or it can be amazing. All up to you to learn it all. Which is something you do when you level up. Maybe not so much by the game but you try things out, and learn along the way. At lvl 80 if you get the expansions you now also have two new elite specs for each class which totally change the way you play.
---
Leveling up in this game is easy. You can do it fast or just in your own time. Don't tunnelvision on hearts, go for events and if you want to make the hearts at the same time then sure just dont burn out on the hearts. Do the personal story. It starts up at lvl 10 and a new chapter every 10 level. This give you buffs and gear and keys and xp and other stuff. And a introduction to the story pre expansions. Story will pick up and be way better when you start to get in to seasons and expansions so don't worry if you are not to happy about the first story.
---
Some mobs have a bluish-greenish bar under their health bar. It is a break bar. Noone will ever tell you about this but it is the most important mechanic to learn about in the game. This link will tell you everything about it. https://youtu.be/ZvC4GtQXKHA
---
You will find this mobs already in the starting area in larger events so watch and learn :)
---
Tekkit have a lot of other things that are good to watch too.
---
When leveling there are no rules really. You try what you want and do what you want to learn what you can. But a few things to think about. Condition damage is very weak at lower levels. There for try and go for power/precision/ferocity stats when you can.
---
http://metabattle.com/wiki/MetaBattle_Wiki
---
This webside have meta builds and other builds to look in too. A way of learning whilst leveling. There are usually a description of what you need but remember all that is for endgame so just take it as info for future.
---
Later on at endgame there are other websides to use for raids, fractals (our dungeons), sPvP and WvW so beaware of that.
---
Oh and if you ever get stuck in game because you lack of info use the ingame chat write /wiki wordyoulookfor and hit enter and it will take you to the wiki and show you infor of anything you need to know. Our Wiki is one of the best i ever seen a mmo have. I still use it every day after 7 years :)
---
Anyway this is too long already but this is my input :)
---
The hell is that link hidden? I checked the community Portal page and the how to help page. It's not on the main or about pages either.
---
Xpac 3, 2021 if ever.
---
There's a difference in being required or being rewarding I guess. Sure, you could ignore the hit/mechanics which stun your character... Or you could aegis/stability to prevent it from stunning in the first place and clearing the encounter faster. Even stuff like might or vulnerability stacking isn't *required* but they do speed up encounters as well. Most boss fights will go faster when you don't ignore the mechanics.
---
I guess you could make the argument that random trash mobs aren't challenging enough but... Should they be? For example: Big Nose Ted and his gang have some of the most annoying stuns for a new player to experience because they both lack stun breaks and a means to avoid the instant hits.
---
I get what you're going for man but not every class has access to all those mechanics. Boon stripping can be remarkably useful but not every class can do it. LS2 has some very painful reminders of that for eles with the rental bits out to ruin your day.
---
I come to and from Asia once every three years or so. All I ever need to do is input the code they send me in email. I don't do 2FA.

But yeah it definitely looks like some mobile game trash
---
Every class has access to dodge.
---
The entirely of the personal story combat was possible by using auto attack.
---
Great to know thank you!
---
Actually, it's on the mainpage (under 'wiki community'), on the how to help page (under 'I'm stuck'), and you can access it via the search term "Discord" (which leads you to [this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_2_Wiki:Discord) page, also searching "gw2 wiki discord" on google works as well.
---
I get why it's not plastered on the footer or header, but why not add it to the How To Help page? It's not like people are going there to ask in-game questions. Add a note that it's for contributors only, not a help desk for the game
---
That article doesn't exactly apply to MMOs.  In Single Player games it's incredibly easy to have "difficulty" modes.  In an MMO, at least in the open world areas, you can't really do that which makes it more difficult in terms of design.  For instanced content you can have difficulty settings easily enough though which is why you see exactly that in WoW and FFXIV with their raids.
---
The article mentions trust and accepting failure as part of progression which is exactly how raids are done in all MMOs: you repeat the same raid boss over and over again learning from your mistakes and eventually succeed.  However, the general GW2 playerbase sees failure as bad and refuse to play a gamemode with a fail state.  Unfortunately, because of the way people are today they don't want to learn or progress but just want everything given to them without much effort.
---
I'll tell it to that one firend who sent me the photo, thanks bud!
---
The trick is using those mechanics sparingly.
---
For example, take finishers. In most of the game, you don't need them against NPCs. But when fighting toxic alliance, every freaking toxic courtier needs a freaking finisher.
---
Too much and too little is always bad.
---
How to solve that? Spread the mechanic:
---
* First, separate enemies between those that work together and those do not. Those that work together can go downed and revive each other. That'll include all sentient races and pack creatures like wolves.
---
* Then, make it so enemies that are too far from other enemies go downed instantly.
---
* Finally, make going downed based on rank:
---
 * Weaker-than-normal enemies like mordrem menders and branded hatchlings will never go downed, even when they spawn as a higher rank version like a Champion Mordrem Mender.
---
 * Normal enemies will only go down in limited numbers and only when they spawn as large groups, and the entire group has to share the number of 'downed' opportunities they get. For example, you fight an enemy party of 5 Forged, take one down, that one gets downed, but none of them will go downed against for the rest of the fight, the party already used up the one 'downed' that they got assigned to them.  To recover their downed opportunities, their whole party would have to leave combat, if one of them gets killed, they'll lose it. 
---
* Veterans and elites will go downed only if they have enough nearby allies. Veterans will need more allies to get downed than elites.
---
* Champions and higher rank will always go downed.
---
* Legendary and Epic enemies will also upscale with nearby players, and require more that one finisher, indicated with stacks of an effect on them.
---
This way fighting toxic courtiers in the open world outside events would now hardly ever get you a finisher, but at a boss fight, you'll see everyone pitching in and showing off their finishers. and players learn that when an ewnemy gets downed, you better finish them.
---
If I hear this line while doing the event I'm going to die. He was my first mentor and I have too many feelings towards that perfect charr. Never forget the great sacrifice.

---
I don't have the game installed rn, what is the cooldown between placements?
---
Sorry but that's just wishful thinking and marketing by starlink. Satellite internet isn't new and it's always slower.
---
Satellite communications are always analog by nature. Converting between analog and digital alone is going to cause it to be slower than fiber. It also suffers greatly from noise and packet losses. Resending a packet isnt double the time, it's often quadruple because of the acknowledgment that needs to go as well. And it decreases assumed deliveries. 
---
Speed of light is only 40% faster in vacuum than glass. And we wouldnt be converting every hop to radio either, only one or two major connections. Everything else will still be same connection. So you cant expect a decrease from 360 which assies often get down to 50-100.
---
It also ignores money. If this new network is indeed better, there is a scarcity issue. Your ISP doesnt necessarily pick the fastest route, it often picks the cheapest route. This is why ping is so high for aussies. Asia doesnt play nice when it comes to country to country connections and direct routes r often dozens of times more expensive than back hauling to some other countries, adding unnecessary hops and longer distance. Like instead of going from Australia to USA, it might go to Singapore, then Hong Kong, then Japan and then USA. This happens very very often. Same issue is going to be played here. Satellite is naturally more expensive than laying fiber. So this connection is going to be more expensive for supply reasons. If its better, you also have a demand reason for yet even higher price. So unless you're a direct customer of starlink, this new backbone is largely going to be ignored. Even if you are starlink customer, theres still no guarantee that the server is going to be peering with starlink and may have to travel by another carrier anyway.
---
Like starlink even says, it's for connecting the most remote places which is what other already existing satellite internet is for. It's not a replacement for internet we have today.
---
Oh yes sorry! My mistake!
---
They did change it a bit. There was like a couple year period where they literally didn’t release any skins outside of the gem store. Now they release a solid amount in pve content.
---
It's 2019 now, but GW2 wiki is still mobile-unfriendly.
---
It's quite well known that Dulfy is a woman. https://twitter.com/dulfycleric
---
See you added another variable to the argument, which nullifies the entire point of the discussion.  The original point was that the corrupted weapons are ridiculously expensive.  Flat out as a gold price for the weapons, too expensive.  It wasn't "the corrupted weapons are too expensive, BECAUSE I only want to use dropped gold on them and not sell anything for gold to go towards acquiring the weapons".  To that argument, i'd say almost everything in the game is ridiculously expensive, because liquid gold drop rate is terrible in this game.  That's not even remotely a viable way to acquire items.
---
A couple counters to that:  
---
- My second reply to the now deleted post, I acknowledge that if you are a completionist and you are going for the AP and the collection, then yes, it's obvious you are going to spend more money or time on it.  That's just the nature of going for completionist end game level activites.
---
- Grawl Paw is account bound.  So of course it will have higher drop rates.  The fragment for the Corrupted collection is set up in a way that if you want to try to farm it you can, it will take longer but you can.  OR you can farm gold in considerably less time and buy it outright.
---
- Godskull weapons are visually a lesser skin.  Corrupted have particle effects.
---
- They are also rare rarity, and level 65 compared to corrupted, exotic, level 80.  So they are naturally not equal on the value scale that anet sort of goes by.  
---
- Corrupted are tied to a world boss, so it naturally makes sense to have them more expensive than the others and require more effort to get the collection finished.  
---
BUT even after all of that, in the current ecosystem of the game and the current content we currently have...My original comment I still stand by 100%, all of the items in that set, weapons and the fragment, aren't "ridiculously" or "ludicrously" expensive.
---
are seriously arguing that gw2 is similar to overwatch because both contain an ice wall
---
I thought the guides were rather redundant seeing how much of the same info ended up on the wiki. 
---
However, I loved the showcases of cosmetics Dulfy had. You can find screens of new mount skins rather easily, but the fact she always showed how it dyed and stuff convinced me the pull open my wallet on numerous occasions.
---
Beautiful wonder.1560
---
Why are posting this ?
---
You mean just like how you can reset the password...?
---
https://account.arena.net/password-reset
---
The fact that the require some sort of verification from an unknown network connection is surely a GOOD thing?
---
I personally don't have a problem with it. They ask for a lot of information for one to do the reset themselves and if they don't have it they must contact support. That is Anet keep the account as secure as it can be. I'd rather wait a few days to get a password reset then have my account hacked. Especially if I had a CC attached to the account.
---
I bought the game years ago. Not everyone keeps ahold of that type of info. Wanna know why? Because arena net is the only fucking company to require that. Not even apple or Google require such strict password reset requirements and they are all for privacy and keeping your shit locked up tight
---
3 days is way to Long imo.
---
Ah, so just because other companies have stupid rules and lack of security ArenaNet should as well?
---
There are other ways to have good security and making the process much more convenient.
---
It's a lil tricky coming from scourge, I play both and the revs circles have cast time so be aware of that, basically all scourges stuff feels like instant cast but especially the elite skill on rev can be easy to double tap by accident and turn it off lol
---
Alright, how would you suggest that they make sure the rightful owner is getting access to the account?
---
I'll try this. Thank you.
---
To my understanding the new Lost Time will only grant alacrity to the mesmer. Unless you consistently stay out of your own wells (Deimos tank on ranged strat?) any decent support build should be able to compensate Improved Alacrity via shatters.
---
Well of Action is the one that can be dropped, at a substantial dps loss. I doubt that will pay off for speedkills but in PuGs it will probably allow forcing more mechanics onto the chrono player again...
---
gw2 only uses 1 core of your cpu, thats why the usage is so low.
---
Jesus that's stupid. This explains why my wifes like decade old AMD Phenom runs this game better than me.
---
Use them on alts, not on your first main.
---
So it would seem -.- I gotta be honest this is probably going to keep me from playing. I'm not super interested in playing an MMO that looks and runs like dog shit which is ashame because it seems like a great game. I love the weapon system and the art style.
---
Sure, but on a wiki the collaboration is often 'incidental' in nature. When Dulfy was active she had guides out super fast because work was delegated out to be completed (I believe she had a guild helping her, or some kind of group?). That happening on its own with a wiki takes longer.
---
And for things like say a solution to a jumping puzzle, with a wiki you get people sitting there sniping each others edits to make sure it's their video guide that's in the article (so they can be the ones to get the youtube views/ad money). With a site controlled by one party you don't get that.
---
Besides, does the wiki even do in depth "here's everything you need to complete every achievement in this chapter, step by step" style guides? The wiki has been around for years, I imagine the reason Dulfy remained popular up until she vanished was because she was actually offering the service that the wiki doesn't.
---
Are you trying to say that being forced to use suboptimal traitline for your gameplan is not a drawback of given elite specialization?
---
I've been playing GW2 since launch.  Back then a bunch of accounts were stolen because the password reset was too weak, and ANet took a ton of criticism across social media for it.  So they increased the difficulty of account/password restoration.  Overall it's a good thing, even if it occasionally inconveniences folks like OP.
---
Pro-tip:  save your CD keys, serial #'s and similar important bits of info in the notes field in your password manager alongside your actual password to that site/game.  Just one of those things living in the modern world necessitates.
---
Hah, welcome to Guild Wars 2!
---
You can get more FPS by turning shadows to "low", character model limit/quality to "low", render sampling to "native" and reflections to "terrain &amp; sky". Try lower resolution too.
---
Also try d912pxy addon.
---
Proof: https://imgur.com/a/PIxBVj4
---
Ah.. lots of the language is "benefits from single cores" I didn't realize/didn't see that it literally can't use additional cores at all.
---
Just wait.   
---
No need to have a cow.
---
GW2 doesn't run on a single core.
---
if an AMD Phenom system is outperforming your rig, then there's probably something else wrong.
---
GW2 has performance issues, but it shouldn't be this bad.
---
Specialization was not specified, only tomes.
---
Tomes have no drawback outside of that niche trait that glasscannon guardians take in pvp - Literally it's only use.
---
I've been waiting 3 days
---
Almost entirely. It uses more cores for a few things.
---
Too few.
---
I would have to replay or go check some videos to be sure but I think he had it equipped for way more than just showing up with just 1 skill. I probably wouldn't have noticed it if it was just the one skill.
---
to be fair, she moved the site to AWS which is expensive just to keep up with the traffic.
---
That was the main site that convinced me to get an ad blocker. I hated three videos screaming at me all the time.
---
I read you already tried d912pxy, there is also a similar thing for "vulcan" you could try this, since you are using a Nvidia card
---
They are probably just really busy. They deal with requests as they come in. So they just have to take care of everyone that put in a request before you. It does suck that one has to wait so long but I'm certain they will get to your request as soon as they can.
---
yo this is really neat. i love seeing people take a whack at concept art, i hope you continue to make more! the idea of world bosses dropping unique weapon and armor skins is so cool.
---
I said they have same level of protection, which doesn't mean it is hard to restore password, it just requires phone confirmation. Anet doesn't have access to my phone. It is pretty common in games, which involve large sums of money and time involved to require data like purchase receipt to restore your password. Yeah, it is easier to do those things in games like wow, but is it really a good thing, considering how some people treat their email account security?
---
Yeah I know. Just frustrating.
---
Congrats my friend. I give you much respect for grinding that out. Must have been hell.
---
No they don't. Ive been able to more easily reset my passwords with them and never been asked for a serial code.
---
At the bar you order 2 apple ciders...and from the mists you hear "proud of ya"
---
Eso doesn't. They have a security question.
---
You shouldn't be getting only 21fps. I only have an 1700x and I get 30+ even with many people standing around me.
---
Yes, you got me. My post history is a good example of how much of a "white knight" I am.
---
But they require more than "a simple password reset email", which is what you asked for.
---
&gt;Telegraphing is the core of the trust system, since it’s where the game designer effectively signals exactly why you died (here is a big, bad, flashy animation that you didn’t notice) and how you can overcome it (you need to avoid this attack).
---
Looking at people dying to huge ass attacks that actually are green/red/whatever or just light their screens up  
---
I don't see, however, this is applicable to an mmo. Here we don't get different difficulties, which is the main topic of the article.
---
yes it does but no setup will let you play in high populated areas with 60fps, what you can do is decrease the character limit, that helps alot
---
I'm not laughing because I think you didn't report it, I just don't believe GS aa evade is an exploit. It's hard to pull off while fighting and offers little in terms of advantage. I would say it's in the same category as double jump.
---
Screenshot please.
---
Just tested it with battle.net. I got sent a code to my email. That's it. I type in the code and get to reset my password. Simple as fuck
---
[Nobody](https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/) [will](https://discretize.eu/builds/mesmer/power-chronomancer) [use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xGNgq4QCxg) [them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qm6_nEa2Z4s) [huh?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IpqH2AX164)
---
Like I said, sounds like a personal problem.
---
This is with supersampling, max model count, and everything else at the highest possible setting. This doesn't really surprise me if I'm being honest. My FPS drops in wow in main cities from like 120 to 90.
---
Must have changed that then, because a couple of years back I had to dig up my old serial keys in order to get my account back.
---
To be fair you are suggesting people are over-exaggerating a problem that clearly exists, and is provably pretty bad. I don't think anyone is over exaggerating. The game seems to be incredibly poorly optimized. It's still using DX9 for starters which has been outdated since like 2012, and it's implementation of DX9 is still limited compared to other games that use it. So yeah I'd say it's pretty poorly coded.
---
Thank you! That’s a brilliant idea! Do you happen to know how often the daily is in Vabbi?
---
* you can use the booster an unlimited time, on unlimited characters as a trial, that only temporary boosts your charactet and sends you to a lvl 80 zone.
---
You can try the class out there and customize it as you wish
---
* instantly boosting gives you all core skills and traits as well as a lvl 80 exotic weapon armor and trinkets set. It can be overwhelming all at once as well as confusing.
---
* leveling up normally unlocks skills and traits in a "normal" pace'. Letting you use ,experiment and learn them with time.
---
However you might also feel "underpowered" at times as you will get a mix of random gear (with random stats) which will most likely weaken your build.
---
In both cases i have a small build guide for you here.
---
All classes have 5 core specs:
---
* One is focused on power, dps, bursts and regular dmg. This is prefered in open world as bursting down mobs around the world makes things done faster
---
* One focuses on precision (crit rate), condition damage (increases dmg from debuffs such as bleeding, burning, poison).
---
Condi dmg can be great against prolonged fights such as with harder boss monsters, but usually it takes some time to ramp up by stacking condies.
---
* Defense, damage mitigation. Pretty simple. Can be used as a layer of defense even with glass cannon gear stats
---
* Healing, support, utility, condi clenses, helping allies and self, applying buffs all around. Always nice to have, specially offensive boons such as might and fury
---
The last 5th trait line is profession specific.
---
For warriors it can improve weapons, adrenaline, burst skills.
---
Rangers boost the efficiency of their pets, and guardian adds effects on their 3 virtues...
---
* For burst builds go with stats that add power, precision (crit chance) ,ferocity (crit dmg)
---
* For condi go for condition dmg, expertise (condition duration increase) as well as precision as many traits have "on crit" effect
---
If leveling normally, focus on having your weapon up to date before armor. 
---
And in general, invest into gear once your lvl 80, no need to waste gold and mats on early levels
---
&gt; ...Well Final Fantasy 14 for starters? Looks amazing...
---
Did you just compare FF14 gfx to GW2, and called it better? Oh boy...we have completely different definition of good gfx.
---
&gt; ...The game is unplayable on modern hardware unless you set it at the lowest settings or install 3rd party software to fix it...
---
This is the definition of over-exaggeration. It's so unplayable that I can get 60fps on max settings in cities, even with gw2hook. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
&gt; ...and yeah 20fps is unplayable in my book.
---
So, why are you still here?
---
Battle.net is easy as getting a code sent to your email that you then type in regardless of how inactive the account is. So idk what your argument is supposed to be.
---
That explains a lot. GW2 was not made to be played with these settings. Unfortunately.
---
When you're in a desert and dying of thirst, any water you come across is a welcome sight. 
---
Just happens that we're in a "crystal desert", and the thing we're dying from is poor class balance, not thirst. And the water we're getting is a small damage boost and a semi-revert to our survivability nerf. :D
---
This is due to a recent Windows 10 update and has been reported in various gaming subreddits, Microsoft has acknowledged the problem and said a fix would be coming by the end of September, I had no problems on GW2 but I did on ESO.
---

---
I'm not sure why, I clicked spoiler and it didn't show up?  Others see it, but I don't as well lol.
---
Nope she has a job shes focusing on.
---
i had the same problem
---
Turning off reflections for water also helps with FPS ( every map has water underneath it across the entire map)
---
&gt; This way dying to something like that would be only your fault because you can't use tools you have properly.
---
Am I going to have to quote the definition of tedious and frustrating?
---
Here is another example of tedious and frustrating but presents 0 threat to the player. Plop down a mob that just does a channeled area heal and give it a decent amount of health. In a 1v1 a player could chip away at it even if they just autoattack. Now think about 1v2, 1v3, 1v4, etc. There are also multiple solutions to this. Push, pull, stun, launch, knockback and maybe poison but the simplest solution would be to simply ignore them anywhere they hang around. This is for open world stuff since instanced things are generally more predictable.
---
is the d912pxy folder were the .exe is?
---
Oh I see your answer is "Make the game look worse". got it.  
---
and apparently how powerful your processor is doesn't really matter? It comes down to how powerful each individual core is, so a 2.3ghz dual core will run it better than an Octocore with 8 2.0ghz cores. The Octocore is arguably "more powerful" in that it can leverage more power but it's still going to run the game worse despite that.  
---
But yeah, when I can run every other game I play at absolute max settings without issue I expect to be able to run a nearly decade old game just fine.  
---
and I think you're nuts btw FFXIV looks orders of magnitude better than GW2. Like I'm tempted to bother taking screen shots, uploading them and linking them because I can't believe anyone would argue that GW2 looks better than FFXIV. I'm not even a FFXIV fan boy. I haven't even hit max level in that game but even I can recognize it looks really good. 
---
GW2 has an art style that hides how bad it looks, like Borderlands which is clever but doesn't change the fact that the draw distance in GW2 is less than half of what it is in most games. That the incredibly dense fog isn't "Aesthetic" it's designed to hide the incredibly poor LOD textures that you get.   
---
Truth be told though there really aren't any good looking MMORPGs.
---
[I don't think anyone has the right to talk about difficulty on that website anymore. Just write for a different site about that topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FD-uwu847Q). 
---
Also quite funny that this comes from a anet dev, our beloved company that is notorious for not introducing the simplest mechanics like breakbars to the players and for literally requiring two button presses to complete the game: Forward and Autoattack. Sometimes "use". The game is literally too easy to fail, and yet here we have someone talking about difficulty as if she even remotely had any access to that concept.
---
Yep. The installer for d912pxy runs great, i choose all of the defaults, i get no errors, and the .dll shows up in the bin64 folder as expected.
---
I'm sorry if it's been asked before, but what happened to Dulfy?
---
Why is the Asura running?  Looks like Norn propaganda to me.
---
And yes, the female is a Norn, because she carried her greatsword sheathed at her waist..
---
I'm European and I live in the us. I go home every year and have no issue playing from anywhere.
---
In fractals you do get a choice but some people have decided to ignore the existence of that choice. In fact it gives you two different knobs.
---
If I recall correctly it was at the end of that period where their CEO Mike wrote a post on the forums about how cheaper gem store skins was a relative failure: people simply didn’t buy them for whatever reason, maybe they looked worse cause they were cheaper and not as much time was spent on them.
---
Paraphrasing here but he basically said that fewer and more expensive skins targetted at richer players, combined with FOMO was much more profitable, which could mean that resources were freed up for ingame skins since artists didn’t have to churn out so many cheap skins.
---
The post is still there if you wanna find it.
---
What peope overlook: A website like that **is** a job. GW2 was not the only game there. Every blogger can tell you that writing articles and providing images takes a lot more time than it looks
---
Well, tell him if he is tired of playing a PvP game, GW2 will be a refreshing change.
---
Sure do. Haven't see an ad in years.
---
Until mounts. Traveling Dry Top was a nightmare!
---
There is also a bit more to it than just telegraph or no telegraph. An overly long telegraph can also make the timing more difficult. Most telegraphed attacks in GW2 are ~1.5 seconds but some are longer(the spinning thing from the awaken is 3 seconds if you don't get out of the circle).
---
What was the name of the level of the rift above the pond? (could you perhaps try to recreate what you have done to see what rift exactly it was, preferably with screenshots so I can add it to the rest of the information?)
---
If it was level 5 (V) then we have seen it before (also there was one like that in the woods on the same map where the giant devourer spawns), but since no one could do anything with it, people considered it just a bug.
---
Also I'm not sure if you will be able to do anything with the skyscale in FoR, as that part shipped back in 2016 when basic mounts were not even a thing, let alone skyscale. 
---
Unless they updated FoR, but it doesn't seem like that yet. I think they just added new Auris to GV map for now :)
---
I'm just glad the minor trait for swiftness on overload isn't on the minornslot now.
---
yrou shinign amror deosnt leme tpye porperly
---
Well many of us get it from black lion chests as well, I have 2 2000gems mount skins just from them including the stag and I dont even key farm much because of limited time to play.
---
The issue could have been avoided or at least reduced with better labeling. Call it something like cinematic mode/movie mode/observer mode/etc. instead of "Very Easy". The naming should better reflect its purpose.
---
&gt; ...Oh I see your answer is "Make the game look worse". got it...
---
If that's what you got out of what I said, then you're hopeless.
---
Also, in addition to that, if unnecessary clutter is better in your eyes in terms of visual look of the game, then: "...we have completely different definition of good gfx..."
---
&gt; ...and apparently how powerful your processor is doesn't really matter?...
---
Are you seeing what you're typing?
---
Also, if you're still confused because you missed it last time:
---
&gt; So, why are you still here?
---
You should just quit. Go play FF14. Nobody is going to be upset if you did that.
---
That's a nice looking website.
---
How old are you?
---
Because it is tedious and frustrating. 
---
Mobs in pve do laughable damage to the point where you can just tank a couple of them even in zerker gear. Add evades and you're just waiting to be allowed to kill theem. Case in point: harpies.
---
On the other end of the spectrum, in wvw you have camp guards that spam ranged blind from a combo field constantly for like 8 seconds. Ofc you don't want to waste your reflect/cleanse/cc on npcs in case an enemy shows up to defend so it ends up being an exercise in misery.
---
In both of those cases AI is too stupid do pose any actual threat because you can just run away/LoS in case you drop low.
---
same here. Playing Chrono as main character since beta but at this state I don´t even know how to play Chrono. They are transforming the class into sth which really I don´t know what they´re expecting the class to be like.
---
I´m playing less and less. The game has really passed its zenith.
---
Hmm i dunno...  How would i check that?
---
We should have a fixed topic about performance issues
---
nvidia inspector can do that
---
I'm starting to think that they just do whatever changes (perhaps tossing darts at board is the way of making decisions what should be done?) so later there would be any reason to do something else or revert things back, so the balance patches could any reason of existence in the end...
---
I switched from league of legends to gw2 as well. I do miss the art and characters and trailers sometimes. Other than that it’s the craving for something more permanent and a sense of progress and new exploration. League world was amazing but it was always in the same map and it was hard to “experience it”. Other than that, maybe the high stress levels from playing league vs the collaborative nature of gw2 was more relaxing.
---
Did you by any chance chopped other planted orchid nodes? Because these aren't behaving like normal Draconis Mons orchid nodes - there's certain use limit on these after reaching which tree just flips not giving anything in return
---
How did you get D912PXY to work for you? I had a bunch of issues with it, stuff not loading (character portraits being a main issue)
---
It just worked honestly i followed the directions in the github and didn't have any issue
---
The wiki team are great, they have a discord which I belong to. It is interesting to see the work that goes on behind the scene. The quality of the wiki is greatly improved, and with the added support of Anet gold wiki project. You would be great addition to their team .    
---
https://discord.gg/C4RMwPN
---
On the other end, where you queue certain attacks after your third auto, it will sometimes give you half the frames for evade as if you were cancelling. It is inconsistent, but removing it for 15 endurance flat on hit is a pretty bad replacement.
---
whish the stab on overload would just move to minor. its so essential!
---
Listen both of you, sometimes we have to be realistic!
---
I would encourage greater utilization of the wiki as well.  The GW1 wiki contains an enormous amount of rich content, much of which is buried behind the articles on their discussion pages.    If you have a question about something you can just view the discussion page to see the whole conversation, which is always on-topic.
---
Unfortunately the GW2 wiki is missing that depth of knowledge because it's been scattered elsewhere across the web on subreddits, the official forums, and fansites like Dulfy's.  I definitely like the idea of players pooling their knowledge in a more centralized and structured place like the wiki.
---
Wiki is the way to go... unless... OP is just looking for a place to post his PPC ads. ;)
---
Wikis let other editors modify your work, and that's a huge red line for a lot of people. The culture of each wiki is pretty important too.
---
Still, you can use your user page if you want to keep your guides safe.
---
As she well should.  
---
That's a lot of time and effort, she fully deserved to make money for it.
---
Only once though, and for Ranger none at all
---
Tbh i used my lvl80 booster.
---
And i dont regret it, i did get early glider+the first mount. After that I started with my personal story just to understand a little bit wtf this huge game is about and sometimes am lost but it was good getting the glider+mount made everything easy
---
Was a looong time ago that we did things with this event, but if I remember correctly, yes.
---
All the 'obvious' stuff has been tried within the first week the event came out, yielded almost no result (no one got past Stabilizer II device), and after that the tinfoiling started aka trying to play the organ in FoR as an anomaly, going into Thaumanova, datamining etc :)
---
I once accidentally opened Dulfy's site in a Chrome Incognito window where most of my browser plugins are disabled, and hooooooooly shit does she run a ton of third party scripts and ads.
---
I would argue for at least getting the glider masteries before doing the rest of PoF. The glider can save your life in falls and is quite useful for getting around. The griffon or skyscale need a lot of gold to unlock that a new player is unlikely to have, they also require a decent time investment while gliding is a quick unlock.
---
And if you care about story, you would want to play through HoT first.
---
We had Aurene when facing Balthazar as well. In single combat without both Sohothin and Aurene we were literally killed.
---
\&gt;  However, the general GW2 playerbase sees failure as bad and refuse to play a gamemode with a fail state. 
---
The fear of the  reaction of folks when  you fail, not the failure itself, is arguably what turns people off. People don't like to be yelled at, and raiders are pretty guilty of getting mad when things fail, too. 
---
I recently quit a guild where the GL would just start yelling at and insulting folks despite us performing pretty damn well. I liked the guild, I liked the gameplay, but I don't play a game to be (or to see my teammates, which is why I finally left) drunkenly yelled at because our five-man group couldn't *always* take on twenty and outright win. I just joined guilds where there is no yelling, even if the gameplay is different.
---
Let's count! So uhh.. 2 with me! Come on boys, line up.

Why? I didn't say the game was hard for me lol. Yeah, I'm a Necro main, so how is that relevant?
---
This is great. Thanks!
---
Branded griffons dont just dodge though, they evade for like 10 seconds--compared to a dodge which is something like 1. Long stuns/evades are just boring or a PITA to deal with for no reason.
---
&gt; I hope the trend continues, and perhaps one day, we will actually get a mount skin for playing the game.
---
I would be satisfied with 4 dye channels, really. No mount skins needed. Yes, this is unpopular opinion.
---
Ah I thought you meant the entrance to Zomorros which literally requires people standing on things.
---
The actual event itself you can still do with very few people if they bring CC and focus targets. CCing djinn is the most important thing with fighting them.
---
Engineer = McCree. but also Bastion
---
happens to the best of us :)
---
Sorry but in terms of the actual visual impression I just need to put in *waaay* too much of my own imagination here. The sceptre and the crown are the only ones I can even remotely visualise to in-game standards in my head and I still have no idea how any of this would capture the billowing ethereal feel of the monster itself.
---
I'm not asking for fully rendered 3D animation but the torso looks like a cookie cutter "breast"plate with giant boobs despite being labeled "Male". Basically I feel any critique would be based more on my own imagination and biases than what is objectively shown in the image.
---
That said the sceptre **does** look pretty epic and we've had severed arms for weapons before so I think I can picture your intent pretty well on that one. Might end up a bit too bulky if we use the Behemoth's actual arm proportions.
---
Thanks, I'll try these out then :)
---
If you play Charr, you will find that Ebonhawke NPCs take special notice of you being Charr (they actually have some different lines for Charr PCs, the Wiki doesn't show that I think).
---
Separatist sympathizers will specifically insult and threaten you for being charr.
---
However, "Officials" of Ebonhawke fully support the treaty and are basically like "we can use any help we get, it doesn't matter that you're Charr". 
---
So they will probably not be personally against Charr joining in, but might avoid it to not stir up more hatred.
---
It actually asks for dual core cpu on launcher if you have a single active core. Verified by disabling all other cores to see it.
---
Wow thats a nice attention to detail! I'll have to test this out x)
---
I mean... they kinda do?

Don't if their interest is PvP. I used to be a mid-plat player but swapped to LoL for my PvP. The game mode is good but once you get to Gold 3 issues with the low number of high quality players just kills the competitiveness of it. You end up with a couple plat 1, a bunch of plat 2-3 and a Gold player or two. The skill difference between a plat 2 and a plat 3 player is HUGE. That leads to Gold or low plat players getting farmed and high plat players getting frustrated because their team doesn't know proper strats and tactics. 
---
Unranked and low ELO ranked are a lot of fun but competitive high ELO is just frustrating and sad. Relatively as far as quality goes a Plat 2 GW2 player is around LoL Plat 2 - note Plat 2's right in the middle of League's ELO but Plat 2 in GW2 is top 90%. There's only a literal handful of GW2 sPvP'ers whose skill all thing equal are high LoL Diamond quality.

No more seasons. No more xpacs. Only sagas now.

2021: Welcome to season 7 of Living Story, the Asuran "CHRONICLES"
---
And for that one pvp fan in the back, we're finally implementing swiss style tourneys
---
Mesmers are great , keep on trucking .
---
Well, it does seem like I’m safe then.
---
Thank you for clarifying this
---
Welcome back agent, it has been a while! Did you remember to bring the apple cider?

&gt; Scourge will be harder/more annoying to play in fights with a lot of movement
---
This is my problem with the change. Its going to make Scourge one of the most frustrating classes to play. No other profession has to jump through so many hoops like Scourge will. Imagine if Druid spirits or Warrior banners only gave their buffs if you're standing directly on top of them. That is our new mini game and its going to make Scourge one of the most unfun professions.
---
&gt; It will also be slightly nerfed in that scenario.
---
Its going to be worse than this. Any fight where you have to move around is going to be nothing but frustration. You either sacrifice a lot of your DPS for self barrier/cleanse or you do your normal rotation and lose a ton of defensive stats. Yet again, no other profession has to make decisions like this. For them its either use a melee weapon or swap to ranged. If Scourge was doing 37k+ DPS I would understand this nerf but we're bottom of the barrel in terms of DPS. This is purely a WvW nerf and its going to destroy Scourge in PvE.
---
This is a good new to hear.
---
Thanks!
---
Well, I had trouble activating 2FA with my mobile number, so I went with the Authenticator bound option for 2FA.
---
Should be safe on this point.
---
This is not true at all unless there are caveats to the rule. I've gotten shackles while actively kiting, or running a bomb out ie. no where close to dhuum.
---
I play everything and imho you should too , this way you'll never get nerfed :D
---
It was nerfed but still very viable in WvW, where chrono mostly is not. Almost every long-term chrono player I have encountered either switched to Mirage or rolled to another class entirely.
---
Not in WvW
---
I also red on forums of a certain french game that you needed to sent a ticket to the support if you intended to play from the US on the french based servers (as it is not permitted  may default)
---
As I have no idea about where the GW2’ servers are located, I thought it could possibly apply here too. 
---
Thank you anyway :)
---
I understand the pain, I got my good ol Kiwi internet.
---
Scepter being a ranged weapon, I usually do less damage with it because I might use it, you know, ranged. Where not all of the stacking for boons is going on.  But yeah, lets nerf it because 5% of the player base do more damage with it than with greatsword.
---
Having to wait 0.35 seconds between pressing F and seeing the kick definitely adds up over 25 flowers plus the small delay for the spores.
---
My laptop runs GW2 beautifully and so far with no performance issues or framedrops; I run everything at max except for shadows and reflections at low and sampling at native.  In WvW I drop player model quality to medium, though I think it would do fine at high (I haven't tried yet).
---
It also has really good cooling.  But it's a $3k alienware (that I got for a fraction because I was fine with a few cosmetic scratches), i9 processor, etc.
---
Except it's not and people do play it.
---
The issue is they dont split functionality, only numbers 
---
It won't be 5+5pbaoe in one mode and 5 + no pbaoe in another
---
You've got the tune to play on the Grove when they go on tour, right there.
---
We just need a festival to happen there to bring them around for the occasion.  
---
What about... "Pale Mother's Day"?
---
66% of Big Nose Ted's attacks are CCs
---
50% of Twitchy Jake's attacks are CCs
---
&gt; Boon stripping can be remarkably useful but not every class can do it. LS2 has some very painful reminders of that for eles with the rental bits out to ruin your day.
---
I can only remember one section where retal is an issue with LS2(the wolf in Iron Marches ...) but boon strip is also useless there because it's not a real boon and you can't strip it.
---
Mean while in WvW we begged for changes to the Shades because the simply make the fights unfun and have been since PoF came out. And yet the game mode were we asked, begged and raged for a nerf now instead is a buff. How can they so blatantly miss the mark in WvW and instead of nerfing it they making it double so annoying and unfun.
---
this change is like a worse version of the ventari tablet in how clunky and awkward it is going to be... but as an inherent spec mechanic. the worst part is that it will miss it's mark on what it is trying to fix by a significant margin.
