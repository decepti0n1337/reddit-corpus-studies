Nice.

Apex is free to play, why do others watch people play that?
---
I catch myself doing that all the time. If I see someone with no points or down arrow, I tend to hang around and help them get hearts or stuff.
---
Maybe lack of a proper system to play it, or reliable internet connection? Or simply the ability to play for whatever reason. I wouldn't be able to tell exactly, but it's certainly not a case of "if you can play football, why do you watch it", though.

\*angery gesticulating\*
---
While the whole I'd rather play it myself excuse is valid and not something you could argue against, personality also plays a big role, most streamers are not that fun to watch (imo) they often put on fake personalities and behave loud and obnoxious, or you get the complete opposite where they are quite and barely interact with the viewers and once in a while answer some questions in a low and barely recognizable tone.. Streaming isn't as easy as you think and it's most certainly not cut out for the most of us. And streaming 1 single game is pretty much a death sentence for any sort of success you were hoping to gain xD 
---
Tldr: go stream, have fun, don't expect too much.
---
If they'd up the cap with 100, they could abandon GW2, live of the money from the banktabs and make a GW3 engine lul.
---
Don't give them ideas you fucking moron.
---
Sadly Reddit is the wrong place to be asking these things. Many of the comments or viewers here aren't interested in Twitch in general. Try going into some of the more popular GW2 streamers and ask them some of these things and I think you'll see a more positive response. 
---
That doesn't mean the feedback here isn't valid or important, GW2 isn't an overly popular game to watch on Twitch and people here have already listed the reasons why.
---
Do it for fun, build your community, be regular (something I suck at). Get in twitch chat and be part of the general community.
---
My point is that a game being F2P doesn't mean people won't watch it. In fact most of those games do better because everyone can play it for free. Fornite or League of legends for example.
---
This is awesome.
---
Behold, Doctor! I can fly!
---
If you aren't using it, try action cam mode (and watch tekkit's youtube guide for tweaking its settings: very important). GW2 is like an entirely different game with it. From WoW like tab target, push buttons, tab again, repeat; to feeling like a third person shooter. It makes everything way more fun, especially if you've played other action mmo's before.
---
Being in a 34/50 squad with green names around and calling it zergbusting is laughable.
---
Thanks for the reply, and don't worry; it was an informative read. :)
---
The Plains of Ashford glitching so bad that they had to briefly disable all NPCs from it makes me wonder if the Branded appearing there were a remnant of one of the beta weekend events where Branded would invade Ascalon to take down Rytlock and where each played killed by a Branded would revive as a Branded to fight in Kralk's name while the survivors' numbers gradually diminished. It could be an interesting side effect of the devs testing something new possibly related to Season 3 on the map and the code causing some hiccups like us getting a glimpse of the GW2 junundu who briefly replaced some of the wurm models in Twilight Arbor prior to PoF launch. :)
---
An interesting tidbit about core Tyria tengu is that they apparently use the charr "rig" so it's more that tengu are based on charr than the other way around when it comes to GW2; the HoT Quetzal tengu, however, don't use the core tengu rig for whatever reason maybe to further differentiate them from their core Tyrian cousins.
---
I just hope that if the Blood Legion insurrection ever happens, it won't be a black and white morality scenario. As a Blood Legion charr player in particular we should be torn about a decision to turn against our imperator even if there was no other way in the end as charr should always remain loyal to their chain of command unless command messes things up catastrophically. Bangar should have some nuance, which we've thankfully seen in his interactions with Rytlock in Requiem: Rytlock story, so I hope they continue to write him not as a Balthazar 2.0 or Baelfire 2.0 but as a cunning warlord mastermind he's supposed to be and who may have genuinely sympathetic reasons for his actions.
---
There's a lot to play with when it comes to charr politics given the rather complicated narrative centering on the Ebonhawke Treaty, and who knows if they tie other lingering plot threads into it too like the sudden introduction of Overseer Kuda in S4Ep2 and her potentially being Kudu's daughter and continuing her late dad's crosscorrupted dragon minion research. I can only imagine what damage could be done if Bangar or any of the surviving Flame Legion splinter group tribunes teamed up with her... :)
---
Just keep an eye on the authorized retailers. Both exp's bundle together for 25 bucks all the time.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
and as a fellow long time tera player, make sure he sets up action cam mode according to tekkit's video. It makes gw2 feel almost exactly like tera.
---
Same here mate. I never watch streams themselves but I do like to watch 10 minute long stream edits like those of RTGaming. I guess audience interactivity is just not that big of a draw for me
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/pPLHC5C
---
Viewed this post at the right time.
---
Either make the stream about something interesting in game, challenging content or skillful gameplay; or make it about the streamer personality or community feel and less about the gameplay.
---
I guess ignore the other 13 minutes? I put that one in because it was fun =D
---
The event does not reset when the fire elemental is defeated, it has its own timer.
---
If someone else started it, it will be on cooldown  for 15-20 mins
---
https://youtu.be/4u_mn6tCsBc
---
Fantastic, another awful build against outnumbered pugs.
---
Thanks for this! I keep hearing to chat in other streams, so sounds like that's what i'm gonna do :)
---
The most reasonable way would be changing the dialog that appears when using the devices both on the platform and at the core to only allowing opening the core after the meta, and only allow starting the event while the core is open.
---
oh shit, that one wasn't even intentional haha
---
I'm not rich by any means, but maybe this is the best motivation!
---
Appreciate the insight :)
---
Make an art stream. You don't even have to be good. Talk about GW2 once in a while -not mandatory.    
---
    
---
Now you can get hosted by the official GW2 channel = profit.
---
Sounds awesome! Thanks for the suggestion :)
---
Thanks man! (Or woman ;) ) much appreciated advice!
---
Thanks!! Will work on both if I can!
---
The Reddit community is the same community that cried when mods decided to un-sticky the bug section on Wing 7's release for a day. Quite literally a single day. Honestly, not the best community to reach out to with this sort of thing. I don't think you'll hit huge numbers streaming Guild Wars 2, but I do know of a handful of successful GW2 streamers who have a small following with GW2 being their main game. It helps to have other games to branch out to if you want to get huge, but you need the foundation first and foremost. Obviously I wouldn't commit to this full time unless you have a solid contingency plan, but if you think you can do it in your spare time actively enough, I say go for it! There's a streamer called NoctWolfTV who is more than happy to share his GW2 streaming experience if you're interested, he's live every weekday from 6 PM - 2 AM Pacific Time. He manages 50 viewers or more playing a variety of gamemodes, consistently.
---
If only xD I am working on some stuff, so this actually gives me some good ideas.
---
100% correct, every fight in the video my giant dick and I outnumber the guild groups. good catch =D
---
I'll take a look at his stream, thanks!
---
Fair enough but why the down vote? I am just curious what's the point of a single player MMO RPG that is neither an RPG or a social MMO. Aren't there co-op single player games for that that allow you to play how you want?
---
I'm not into watching streams that much but when i do i watch top PvP streams to learn and improve my own gameplay. I can't stand watching gw2's pve stream even though i enjoy pve as well, mostly because i get frustrated watching someone play poorly.
---
Whoa, that's nice.  I don't get it though, the amount of damage output is obscene and even more devastating than pre-nerf Meteor Showers.  So how come those got nerfed?   :O
---
That looks like a helluva lot of fun. I’ve been recently just screwing around with trap DH which is hilarious. :)
---
the damage from this is only really stupid if you can get them to group up like at chokes or when they try to res, otherwise it's about the same as a weaver damage in comparably glassy gear
---
How much do you want for account-wide character bag slot upgrades?
---
Over 20k hours: 2 precursor (dusk &amp; dawn), 2 winterheart infusions for 700g each and a snow diamond infusion for like 400g. Oh and I won Zap once in a stream giveaway if that also counts as rng.
---
&gt;I wish Anet would add more Elite Specializations
---
FTFY
---
Ye they need to make a passenger seat mastery to allow players to ride on friends mount. Would be great to give new players a ride. Would tie the community together :D
---
Yeah, but aren't chokes and clumped up groups also when Weaver's old meteor shower used to shine the most as well?  
---
Regardless, I'd love to give your Guardian build a try.  It's got a ton more damage potential than what I could do as a Weaver in the past, so it could really help my server's blob a lot too.
---
Thanks for sharing, man!  :)
---
Yeah, in my "Elite specs in LWS5" post a while back, I wrote something on us getting more lore alongside the specs.   
---
My idea was a collection that unlocks your role -- something similar to Skyscale that would have you gather items, meet people, travel and learn about your profession.   
---
In the end, I didn't like the idea of putting classes behind collections **but** I do wish we could receive some more achievement/collections alongside our specs. Maybe every spec has an armor set (like FFXIV) that you could unlock the pieces of by doing all of these lengthy collections. They already do it with weapons -- I would love to get a greater sense of what exactly a Scourge is and where their magic came from.   
---
At times, I wonder what parts of my character's skills are even canon. Are little zombie pets a natural sight in Tyria? Do necros just chill in bars at times with tame flesh golems behind them? Is my noble human popular because they fart purple butterflies? Help me understand the story attached to these powers!
---
They could buff power Revenant damage by like 200% or make its skills hit 5 targets tho.
---
Power Rev is a fcking meme!
---
Red killed the lord way too early. If you can't end the game with the lord kill it is not worth it to give up map presence.
---
Look into a Support Boon Revenant - its great!
---
That would be a delay. I predict July 30th for episode 1 of season 5 or Festival of the four winds. Usually bonus weeks are to bridge the time between big releases. As for PAX they never really do reveals at conventions with the exception being HoT reveals. I expect episode 1 before the anniversary with festival of the four winds releasing with the 7th Anniversary along with a video like last year of the past 7 years and what comes next. Obviously this is my prediction.
---
Don't drag your axe on the ground like that...the magic will jam
---
I've kinda gotten used to almost always holding down right click lul.
---
Well the trailer would be this Tuesday but I agree I'm 50/50 but I agree its a possibility but we need to be prepared about the disappointing announcement of Four winds coming so soon after Dragon bash.
---
It can get buggy sometimes. Both my medium zerk and viper uses the default ascended skin and I found that sometimes build template don't switch out the armor. So I always check my equipped gear after loading with build template. 
---
I'm going to skin my viper set, hopefully it'll solve the bug.
---
Not quite, it's actually a name for a warband that's being punished for some reason.  [Here's the wiki page on the term](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Scrapper_(warband)).
---
Renegade: We have scary af condi damage.
---
ANet: Whelp, better nerf Revenant.
---
\*Nerfs swords and Notoriety. Buffs Mallyx.\*
---
Heralds: \*quietly sobbing\*
---
Nice
---
I started streaming gw2 just a month and a half ago. I average 20-40 viewers a session and reached 50 subs already. If you’re doing high level content, look good, and are personable, people will come. Play off of connections and make friends with other streamers. I’d love to help you out if you decide to make a run at it.
---
From a content creation standpoint there is very little variety. For simply streaming the game sure you can do pretty much anything but for getting newer players interested in the game you have a very limited pool to pull from as there isnt a whole lot of end game repeatable content.
---
Like there isn't any incentive to do Fractals other than to finish achievements or do your dailies, Raids reset weekly and there isnt really much to do once you did your full clears other than achievements/collections or training runs.
---
Open world farming is repetitive but its not as eye catching to new players since its just the same as your typical MMO grinding.
---
Arguably the only content the game has that fits would be the PVP or WvW modes, which as we know get very little love from ANet as far as content goes. SPvP has its occasional automated tournaments and ranked seasons with a fairly good system to keep players somewhat interested, WvW usually gets an update or an overhaul once in a blue moon when the stars and planets align.
---
Streaming aside, Youtube is in the same boat as there's multiple gold farming guides, collection guides, wvw/pvp montages, build showcases, lore videos etc that its generally oversaturated, and some of the rare gems are hidden away in small niches that most people wont see until they scroll as far down as possible or be 5+ pages deep into their search engine of choice.
---
&gt; What would you like to see?
---
A unique/fresh perspective on the game. 
---
Game isn't enough in most cases but especially in the case of GW2. WP's scraping up the bottom of the content barrel by doing completion streams, Teapot does organized/community stuff and commentary, what will be your niche?
---
Or better yet, don't give banners out like that. You can't place banners in WvW anywhere anymore there are so many useless ones, and the enemy just trolls by placing the free useless banners on your territory so you can't place heroes or spirit banners.
---
Everyone that was successful from a GW2 streaming point of view was because they offered something different.  I'd also like to add that I'm putting in content creators/YouTubers in there as well.
---
Aurora Peachy: Slower pace, very in-depth and takes her time exploring everything about the game.  She's a sweet person who loves everyone that watches and is very engaged with her chat.
---
Wooden Potatoes: Known for his extreme in-depth look at lore and speculation.  The meme is that we will get a 10 second trailer and he will make a video that's 45 minutes long explaining everything we saw.
---
Docgotgame: Kind of all over the place.  He's just an outgoing guy that loves community based content.  What I mean by all over the place is that you might see him in PvE with a zerg or leading one in WvW.  He loves all aspects of the game.
---
Phantaram, Chaith, Helseth, Vallun, etc.- PvP streamers that generally teach you more next level tactics.  They might not be the most entertaining but they will show you how important it can be to  do things like canceling weapon animations to get shorter cooldowns.
---
So yeah, it just depends.  I don't think you're going to be huge given that GW2 isn't very fun to watch, but there's still a chance at 7 years into the game you could get a following.  You just need to be different.  Don't expect me to even think about opening twitch though to watch you level up to 80 or walk around in open world PvE.  Its just not gonna happen.
---
GODS
---
is there an actual nsfw pairing to this one :eyes:
---
Don't just sell the gear flat, salavage it for mats and then sell and for maximum results open it all on a bag opener which is a level 45-55 character in order to get platinum and linen which is worth a fair coin. Though getting mithril, elder wood, and silk is still plenty of coin.
---
Don't get me wrong, it can certainly help in some combat situations for closing gaps, getting to dps or mechanics sooner, etc.
---
But it's such a marginal benefit. It's primarily an engineer mechanic, but whenever I look at it I always wonder... why is it here? If they scrapped superspeed applications and replaced them with other boons, then engineer (and to an extent ele) would have support options.
---
If they replaced all engineer superspeed sources with different boons, something like a diviner support scrapper could be interesting.
---
Its suppouse to grant immunity to chill/cripple which is a good thing. But, I am not sure if ANet had long lasting ideas about superspeed.
---
Copy that! I think I'll find a spot for myself soon enough :)
---
Yipee. Shame I hit cap a year ago.
---
25% off isn't that great of a deal though... unless you're converting from gold.
---
is it matter if I play LW4 story before other LWs
---
Fair enough! Hopefully I'm more exciting than drying paint xD
---
The final proc of hunter's ward is loaded with back-damage.  It does more as well as the immob.  If you can add that onto the symbolic avenger trait, you can boost that even more.  10% or whatever.  Its hard to get people to stand still that long and not dodge but its easy to secure at least one down each time.
---
No. But I recommend that you do so that you get the full story. If you don't care about the story, you can play LS4 first.
---
I used to run servers in other games back in the early days of Counter-Strike and the like.  One of the hardest parts is setting up an identity for yourself.  Once you get that following, more and more will come.  Good luck but its gonna be really hard with GW2 to establish a following.
---
I think the extreme movement speed effect is here to stay, especially in PvP/WvW. I don't know about superspeed in general, and it would be nice if it was a more useful boon/effect in PvE.
---
Thanks! I'll keep at it :)
---
Yup~ they are using rifle build, one of them is dual rifle and one is rifle with sword dagger. Reflect isn't very effective against them because they can just stealth away or atk other people, at least that is what I face when I using Mesmer's feedback. But thanks for the idea :D
---
Ding-ding, bro. It's 5 stacks now. They nerfed it from 9 (10? idek anymore) a long while ago because suffer.
---
And I purchased one last week...
---
I care about story but my English is not so good, I don't understand half of the story...
---
Dungeons in GW2 have 2modes: Story mode and Explorable Mode.
---
Story mode is what you can run through while leveling, it is an easy story driven version of the dungeon - usually labeled as "story" in the lfg. It's worth running once in general, but after that it has very little replay value.
---
Explorable Mode is something, that opens up once you've finished the story mode, and covers what happens in the dungeons after the storymode. It's usually split up in 3 Paths (4 in a specific dungeon) that each can be run daily for tokens that then can be traded in for lvl 80 armor and weapons. It's usually labelled as "p1" (p2, p3) in lfg, depending on which path you intend to run.
---
Those explorable versions of the dungeons are usually run by people that are already lvl 80 as they can get a bit iffy with lower leveled characters.
---
With this information available to you now, lets look at possible reasons why your lfg didnt succeed.
---
As others said, maybe you're not lvl 80 yet. It's not neccessary but it helps quite a lot and people shy away from lower leveled players on that.
---
Maybe your lfg wasnt very clear in what you wanted to do. Since the dungeons are split and work a little different in gw2 you may have been looking for something that doesnt exist in that way.
---
Or maybe the dungeon was currently not available due to event chains (someone linked it already). You can see that on the map by checking out the dungeon icon. If it is crossed, you currently cant enter.
---
Hope this helped and gave you a bit of an idea on how to tackle dungeons. CoF used to be one of the most run dungeons in the game due to easy access to berserker gear &amp; 2 fast and easy paths - that being said, zero clue on how lively the dungeon lfg is these days :)
---
And yet, I've only personally seen Invisiman during Serpent's Ire. And he's only there when the hydra is NOT culled. As soon as I leave to kill sparks, his name on the meta box is back to normal.
---
Invisiman can see sin.
---
My drunk raid team keeps wiping on Spirit Woods. Need is so, so subjective.
---
That's definitely what I think I've seen; most of the discussions on Revenant that I've seen have been one to two years old. It's good to hear all of the positive responses on it now, and nice to know that ANet does change things based on player opinions!
---
Yeah, I feel the emphasis on superspeed for scrapper is completely irrelevant to any content that isn't PvP. Which is a problem -- scrapper has had virtually no place in PvE except as a healer, and they just destroyed that with this patch too.
---
There's better characterization in this one image for Jori and Kass than Arenanet has ever put into the game.
---
I love stjepans art style :D
---
When the score was roughly 250-425, I was pretty much in the mindset that we'd lose.  I never afk or quit a match for many reasons, but this is one of those times where me continuing to play paid off generously.  
---
We worked super well together to secure the far point and due to overconfidence (I assume) from the enemy team, they funneled us kills by trickling in instead of fighting as a team.  
---
Overall super good feeling and expanded my concept of comebacks when it comes to GW2 PvP.  It really is possible to come back even when super far behind late into the match.
---
Ah, that's right.  It's been a while.
---
&gt; 1) They remove a condition, 2) They give a small heal, 3) They give alacrity, 4) They give quickness, 5) One of them gives distortion.
---
Thanks for highlighting why shatters are all loaded base skills which needs even more nerfs.
---
His guild is just as toxic as he is.  Definitely wouldn't recommend it.
---
all rolls, all bosses booM™ :D
---
Yeah, I've pretty much exclusively played PvE while running Greatsword, Sword/shield, and for me it hurts a lot, since now it actively can HARM you to run chronophantasma as all my phantasms created take too long to become clones after their two series of attacks. As well, when just casually porting folks for jump puzzles, I used to just spam out all my shatters just to get a little bit more Alacrity and get portals out a bit quicker, but now it's just so slow in comparison, with the only way to gain alacrity is by the well, or shield 5.
---
Hard disagree. Groups I've been in with him with him not being leader have been subject to 37% alacrity uptime (yes, this is with him and others alive the whole fight), and shit like him constantly typing in squad chat to slow DPS on frozen king when we're on pace to wipe to enrage.
---
Care to elaborate or are you just throwing this statement out without backing it up?
---
This was fun! [Log for anyone interested](https://dps.report/x8yB-20190719-234102_cairn).
---
Same for you too, you can try contact Anet Support, to give you the gems different, I'm sure they'll be willing to assist you further :)
---
I'm also not liking the new playstyle of chrono... maybe later I'll get used to it, if I'll still have to tank in raid, but atm it's not enjoyable at all.
---
Currently I don't even see the point why they left the alacrity/quickness on shatter there. After this change this is pointless.
---
Putting distortion and CS on the same button ended up it having a very limited usage. I'm totally not going to use it for distort - that is if I can get rid off of muscle memory. :S
---
Thanks for teaching me how chrono traits and shatters work.
---
[My chrono](https://i.imgur.com/Ttft7IE.jpg) is eternally grateful for this amazing vast wealth of knowledge you have shared with me.
---
What's your third trait line? I settled with Alchemy for now for the Elixir buffs.
---
Idk about LOTS...unless you kitted out half a dozen characters or something, a set of ascended gear is only like 2500 relics compared to infinite potions at 5K, 5K, and 8K
---
Hmm, the benefits of having a Mesmer GF comes more clear to me.
---
The benefits of having a necro GF though...
---
Serial, I've seen many many of your vids in youtubes and i'm simply amazed at the things you were able to pull off in those clips.
---
Sad to see the class after this patch and you not having fun.
---
:)) u think social responsibility depends of social grade :))) I get u point :)))  just to be clear - tier 1 or 2 ;)
---
how do you learn someone is new? I was helping a newbie crowd and 2 of them started flying with skyscales...
---
Would be more impressive if you killed him while he was alive
---
Why watch a game if you just could play it by yourself?
---
Except that Wychmire Swamp is not at all connected to the Ullen River. Nothing relates the two, that's just player theory (which doesn't make sense) being spread as fact.
---
Besides that, there were dozens of such faces in GW1, not just the Riven Earth falls.
---
Tell your little sister she's pretty good at drawing.
---
Yes they have been. There's actually several "giant rock heads" throughout both GW1 and GW2. The trend began with Eye of the North; the most famous are the [Riven Earth faces](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/File:Riven_Earth.jpg), but there were many others.
---
You can find another head in this style in the Tears of  Itlaocol mini-dungeon nearby, and a different style of giant heads in Hoelbrak, Diessa Plateau, and Fireheart Rise ([God's Skull](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:God%27s_Skull.jpg)).
---
A great piece of two fantastic characters... who sadly don't get as much light shined on them as they should.  I worry that Anet is going to start phasing out our Dragon's Watch buddies. 
---
:( Marj and Kas fighting with little to no screen time, Taimi getting the incurable disease flag, Rox finding a new home with the Olmakahn, and Braham -- while on better terms -- still having started his own guild.  Kind of feels like they're just sweeping beloved characters off the board.
---
As a 6.5k hour mesmer, I agree. WvW mesmer was fun to play when SoI could share your boons, because you could see the effects of your class on your mates. We got that trashed, and became a very subpar healer with good utilities and survival. And now we got our survival trashed as well.
---
My take on this subject: either split mesmer skills between modes and give us our boonshare in WvW back, or give veil and pulls to another class, preferrably Necro or Guardian, since we're advancing to a 2-class not fun at all meta.
---
God u must be so much fun at parties aren’t u
---
just throw them away
---
The superspeed is pretty useful on River of Souls however I fully agree that giving Scrapper access to both alacrity and quickness to allow direct competition wjrh Chronomancer would be preferable.
---
I think they remove it as a general effect so they can tweak it individually for every profession.
---
Why don't you open your own training squad in LFG? My first boss kill was my own training run of Cairn while playing a banner warrior.
---
Thats quality Artwork!
---
Fuck me literally just bought 2 a couple days ago... anyway to predict what they’re putting on sale in the near future?
---
Wow it’s almost like they’re a profession mechanic or something...
---
Great match history. Reminds me if that clutch finals match.
---
Worth it.
---
This was fun! 💕 Thanks for the epic run.
---
Sure do miss this game.
---
Some gear can be obtained without them and you need to right click said piece to select whichever prefix you want. Just hover over your gear until you find the one with no stat bonuses and thats the one you gotta select it for
---
And what do shatters do exactly? You miss sooo much damage from sword that you will not regain by using more shatters
---
Which glider is that?
---
If you add a scourge to your squad it will make it more balanced. Just a pro tip for you.
---
&gt; We will be best friends beast! Until we slaughter you! eeeehahahhaha
---
Einhar is the best
---
Nah it's just a trade off between playing mesmer and playing a class that consists of (in WvW) two weapon skills, two utilities and an elite (gravity well, illusion of life and portal).
---
they were not tryint to nerf anyone. They simply trief to add the "drawback" they are adding to all elite specs.
---
Support Raid Chrono has not been OP at all in 2019 (since introduction of diviner stats in january).
---
 Only the DPS chronomancer build has been op in the best groups (i believe 2 guilds maybe 3 pull off these teamcomps) where you stack 7 dps chronos and thanks to timewarp and very precise communication they maintain quickness without any support chrono - this way they gain an additional dps slot while being one of the higher benching specs, even if pchrono rotation is very hard to pull off.
---
play how you want
---
Holy crap..that thief at 2:25m mark got 100 to 0 in an instant.
---
If you think that then you will do everyone a fabor by not playing chrono anymore.
---
Most condi rotations are even worse to me, but to each their own I guess. Soulbeast, autoattack Mirage, Scourge and almost any Condi build is just braindead spam stuff on cooldown. The only remotely interesting rotations there are engi and ele, with engi being quite bad as condi and with all Ele condi rotations being super simplified by this very patch.
---
dagger/dagger.
---
Staff because I like the skills and how it looks
---
Read install instructions, you need to download from releases page
---
And there are walls made out of wood literally 3m away, but no, we have to blow up the reinforced metal door
---
I’m upvoting for the naked blue man, thanks.
---
I'm curious and I genuinely mean no hate OP.
---
Why do you join a PvP mode and then play a build that's entire intention is to avoid PvP? I would understand somewhat if this was a zerg build but for soloing it doesn't make much sense to me.
---
If you learn to play an actual roaming mesmer build you can stop a lot of camp flips, pick off the tail ends of zergs ect.
---
&gt;There's no way I can have a clone out in WvW 
---
This is a little dramatic considering you are never in the zerg, I have zero issues getting clones out when soloing.
---
-----
---
Anyway, Play what you want it's entirely up to you obviously but I think the shatters may have been a targeted nerf, You listed yourself the amount of self-peel they have
---
&gt;1) They remove a condition, 2) They give a small heal, 3) They give alacrity, 4) They give quickness, 5) One of them gives distortion.
---
This is all ontop of stealth, teleports and some decent mobility if running staff. Chrono adds a really strong block skill x2 and a rewind. That's a hell of a lot of survival.
---
You're even saying yourself it's SOOOOO powerful, That's probably why it was nerfed.
---
Tradeoffs - Scrapper got them, Chrono got them. I wish they would hurry up with the other classes though so things can feel more inline and less like targeted nerfs.
---
I'm of the opposite opinion. Not for PvE and levelling, but for endgame content like PvP (or TvT as I've always called it; Trolls vs Turds), raids, high-tier fractals and WvW. The main problem here is the squad functionality, which because of its kick ability lays all power to be abused in the hands of the "mob" itself. Play what they want, as they want, or kick. 
---
Sadly, squad/party abuse isn't yet reportable. The day this happens, boy would we have an awesome community. All across the game, not just in single player mode.
---
No more desert pls
---
yeah of course. but even if you have someone who can't find their button on cool down, the negative effect on the squad is far less than what happens with a bad chrono, which is my main point. currently chrono has so many tradeoffs, there's nearly no reason to have them, except against high pressure bosses where shield 4 and sword 2 just outclass other possible tanks. against most bosses a FB healer will do just as well as a chrono, has an easier time keeping quickness up and brings more utility because chrono needs all 3 utility slots and can't even swap them out.
---
**Some bonus stuff:**
---
Some additional notes on the development process of my Living World Season 5 idea:
---
* The goal is to focus on standalone episodes instead of an overarching narrative. There are lot of unsolved mysteries in the game, and this is a good opportunity to finally bring proper closure to them, right before we move on to new storylines far from Central Tyria.
---
* In earlier drafts, [Aurene](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Aurene) had a minor subplot where she went around cleansing the Brand to win mortals over to her side. I'd rather move away from branded and crystals altogether, so I got rid of that. The finale was originally at [Dalada Uplands](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Dalada_Uplands), and it dealt with the Blood Legion turning everyone against Aurene. As the Foefire plot grew, I relocated the zone south and made the ghosts of Ascalon the catalyst for the third expansion instead.
---
* The [margonites](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Margonite) were a late addition. I wanted to revisit Elona for a last time before moving on, but I couldn't get a decent excuse for visiting the Domain of Sahlahja. Initially, this one was the fifth episode, dwarves being the fourth, and it was named Pretender Wars. No point at a war for Joko's throne when Elona is moving away from the old government anyway. I didn't know what to do with the conspiracies around the Order of Shadows, and I figured out their proximity to the Mouth of Torment could have a double purpose. Margonites returning is also a good opportunity to bring back the Apostate and solve other GW1 plots including other demons too.
---
* [Lord Jadoth](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Lord_Jadoth) is supposed to work as a minor recurring villain, not some big bad evil, that role is reserved for [Bangar Ruinbringer](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bangar_Ruinbringer). I want to deal with the [bloodstones](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bloodstone) in the future, and the return of the margonites gave me the perfect driving force behind it. The [shadowstone](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shadowstone) could be its own big thing too, so why not. I wouldn't rule out Ruinbringer and Jadoth working together at some point, as I've long planed to have one of the missing bloodstones be inside Blood Legion territory, maybe under the Blood Citadel itself. Lady Glaive could be working for the margonites as well, knowingly or not.
---
* The ritual to break the curse of the [Foefire](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Foefire) was sabotaged, but the public opinion is unaware. Those implicated have gone into hiding until they can prove their innocence. The Blood Legion is somehow involved, but that's all we know.
---
* The new masteries would enable mounted combat for raptors, springers, skimmers, and jackals. Junundu wurms and rhinoceros would have combat capabilities from the very beginning.
---
Some notes on my third expansion idea, which might help understand some of the decisions behind my take on season five:
---
* The third expansion is all about retaking Ash Legion territory, by forging alliances with other races and factions. Bangar Ruinbringer wouldn't be properly dealt with until Living World Season 6, meaning the expansion itself wouldn't have a finale including the death of a major villain. Instead, the finale would be a big classic battle between two armies, and the first big victory of many to come. That doesn't mean the enemy faction won't have leaders of its own, some of which could even join our side later on.
---
* The new region is based on multiple Asian themes, from India to Mongolia, with touches of lost world and prehistoric fantasy. The Blood Legion would bring us back to the times of GW1, when charr were a barbaric warmongering race. They would favor beastmasters over engineers, riding oliphants, rhinoceros, and panthers into battle, boosting them with shamanic bloodlust magic. The region was inhabited by the [forgotten](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Forgotten) and the [jotun](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Jotun) in ancient times, and exploring their ruins would be an important part of the story. A tribe of tengu lives in the jungles near the spring of the Elon River, and one of the largos houses has a permanent hunting lodge in the area. Multiple races of ogres roam the plains, giants inhabit the mountains, and mantid hives dot the landscape. The Ash Citadel is located under the mountains of Dzalana, inside a labyrinthine cave system. The female champion of Jormag can be found in the region, spreading her master's corruption among the ogres and giants.
---
* One of the main features of the third expansion is new playable races, three in total: [Tengu](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tengu), [Largos](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Largos), and [Barathrum](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dwarf) (crystal dwarves). As of now, GW2 gives you no reasons to have multiple characters of the same profession, heavily downplaying the addition of new races. This feature would be reinforced through racial masteries, which would unlock account-wide bonuses, together with race-exclusive upgrades for open world PvE. Things like [norn spirit forms](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Spirit_form) and [asura golem suits](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Scruffy_2.0) would be integrated into the game through these new masteries. Additionally, the new warband system would let you attach two of your own characters to another main character, enabling character swap without needing to go to the character selection screen, making the use of race-exclusive features easier.
---
* One of the big features to be introduced either during LW5 or X3 is a reimagined quest system, combining the best of story instances and map meta events. These quest chains branch into different paths depending on your decisions, your performance, and secondary objectives. They reset daily upon completion, letting you replay them to see all the different endings. Elite quests are be longer and require a party of five to be completed, some spanning over multiple zones across the world, resetting weekly instead. Being strictly open-world, other players are able to join you and share progress easily. Dynamic events, renown hearts, and story instances wouldn't disappear, but quests would effectively become the main driving force for the story.
---
* I want to introduce new weapons [(few examples here)](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/712235/#Comment_712235), either during LW5 or X3. My ideal number of new weapon types is 6, the same number as the episodes, so we could get one legendary weapon for each new type during the season.
---
I would like to develop the third expansions idea properly in the future, including new elite specializations [(here are some early ideas)](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/38383/ideas-for-27-new-elite-specializations), and some sort of player housing system, following the ideas of Sun's Refuge.
---
The fourth expansion would be Cantha, I guess [(here's an outdated prototype)](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/36018/guild-wars-2-the-celestial-tournament-cantha-expansion-idea). Going north after Jormag is also an option, but I think that would work better as the fifth expansion. Of course, these are all just fan ideas, none of the above is official in any way whatsoever.
---
Now that's really it, hope you had a good time reading through everything!
---
I mean ye but it seems to be one everyone wants to ignore.
---
"I have to actually make clones now? Chrono is dead"
---
I think they are removing it from classes that have too much of it, but don't really need it or have any connections with it thematically. 
---
I think it's very good to keep it unique on ele and scrapper (similar to alacrity being limited to 2 classes) with occasional skill/trait that helps a certain niche (like setting up spb bubble).
---
I doubt that both groups are identical. But anyway, the joke is, they're not at all toning down the power creep. Chrono certainly was OP for a very long period of time, but the nerfs of the previous year have brought it down to a level where it has serious alternatives. The current changes do little to address the remaining problems, but they again make it much more tedious to play. Holo is even worse - it already was a mediocre PvE spec and the "drawbacks" totally broke it for PvE, while doing nothing in PvP modes, where holo is strong.
---
On the other hand, they're giving other specs power levels that are nothing but obscene. A year ago, I had some hope that the balance team finally had found a path to reason - the latest balance patches however make it obvious they're just as clueless as they've always been.
---
Power chrono didnt change apart from not being able to shatter without clones.
---
If somebody can't level up in a game such boringly easy as GW2, he probably has some brain issues or something. Also, "helping" with it would be killing the most fun you can get from this game, because when you've learned its basic principles and fully developed your first character, adorning them in full exotic gear (which hardly can take more than a 2-3 months), most of the game instantly dead for you, because except from DLC maps, high-lv instanced content and some bosses and metas in the rest of the Open World is boringly easy and you can annihilate it solo. You find yourself literally re-doing the same limited content over and over 8-9 months after you started to play alraedy.
---
So no need "helping" with leveling, let the little guy have the most significant portion of fun they'll ever get from this game.
---
It will take a while until sc will get updated, but follow their discord and youtube channels, there are plenty of videos and numbers already
---
I would try FFXIV but I don't like the weeby style, combat personally.
---
I just want them to show us anything new for us to look forward to.
---
WoW is getting Classic and a bunch of people are hyped for that.
---
FFXIV launched a very successful expansion.
---
ESO launched an expansion as well.
---
I can't help but feel we're staying behind. We need something new and big to show that gw2 is still rocking.
---
I've tagged up in open world and lots of people joined, not a single person communicated anything, I felt I was playing alone with bots it was disappointing/depressing.
---
Lots of "why watch a game when I can play it" here unfortunately. The strange thing is most here probably enjoy playing the game more than posting on Reddit, yet they still post here. I could say "why post about a game on Reddit when I can play it".
---
Oboy you have a lot infront of you. HoT story was a step in the right direction and improved the story by a lot, but jump on to season 2 and then PoF and then season 4 and you will get your mind blown if you felt like that for HoT :)
---
This just seems really disjointed, while ANets idea of Living World is to tell a continuous story. I also heavily dislike moving away from dragons, there are still 3 out there and they should always be major forces in the story instead of being shoved away.
---
it's not even exclusive to GW2, asmongold has to put on an exaggerated persona to keep people watching while he is raiding and even then it still isn't that entertaining unless he is talking about something i'm interested in, it seems to work for a lot of people though.
---
I left the game due to the Chronochanges a year ago when mimic  became a thing. I didnt think they could destroy the class even more but here we are now. Im so sorry for thouse chrono mains that had  faith and  didnt leave because anet doesnt like your class.   
---
I wish you the best of luck and i hope that at some point they are fixing the stuff so that the class becomes fun again.
---
any number of reasons, they could just feel like talking, not enough time to play the content they want, taking a break from the game but not from reddit, on the bus / plane / in a car, multitasking while away from home or multitasking at home.
---
Why lb? At least for pve (freaks/raids) GS/z+f is Meta pdps
---
LOL, a siege hugger that is typically off tag and plays full nomads, I have zero sympathy, you should stay in PvE where you belong.
---
I like the esthetics.
---
I don't care about distortion getting merged with Continuum Shift, heck, I'd be fine if Shift only gave aegis instead of distortion (or gave neither, the shield has a good enough block). The annoying part is that they require you to have clones to use any shatter, not even Mirage does that (also, does Mirage even have a drawback?). 
---
They didn't even really nerf chrono's strength so much as nerf how much fun they are to play. Now it's just clunky and a chore. I don't care if a class has top DPS or boon uptime or whatever, I just want to have fun, and right now, chronomancer is not fun.
---
do you know the word balance? cos well it's from the beginning of ls3 that they we are working on that , there is no reason at the moment to defeat other dragons
---
Chrono got hit hard in raids though. It actually looks awful to play now
---
Sure, no reason why this wouldn't be allowed. You have to pay for the accounts so it's money for Anet.
---
Yeah for WvW this must be a horrible change,  but to all the other people that cry about pve and stuff... learn to play your class.
---
Glorious
---
Be aware that lots of the daily rewards aren't that great and the great rewards are often account bound.
---
Power mirage is and has always been more fun in open world. In any case, the problem with power chrono in open world is that most of its DPS comes from phantasm skills, which have an unbearably large cooldown (relatively speaking) when jumping from enemy to enemy in a mob.
---
Oh, I see!) no wonder i haven’t met them then, I believe I started playing right after this release)) thank you!
---
I don't know. More interesting play? I've not played PoE so I can't comment too deeply on it.
---
You could also get a much cheaper gossamer insignia, and use the mystic forge to change the stats to Zojja's.
---
someone wants it to be extra spicy
---
This is why I said this is not the best place to ask these questions. Some people here are simply not interested in Twitch, which is fine but it means you aren't likely to get the answers you are looking for when it comes to streaming.
---
How did Scrapper healer in PVP get destroyed?
---
Raiders in Training may be dead but Raid Academy is far from it. They directed people to RA in their announcements, go check it out
---
Guardian is a solid all-rounder and has one of the better balanced core builds with solid alternatives as Firebrand or Dragonhunter. It's also fairly sturdy in PvP. Most of its damage mitigation is *active*, meaning you have to time things carefully, but when you get that down you're bloody unkillable. 
---
The three "pet" professions are all very safe and tanky. 
---
Necro is excessively tanky due to them having a second health bar and if you use a pet-focussed build you can pretty much destroy your way through most solo content and their sturdiness makes them very strong in PvP. Rangers are another strong solo class because you get a pet and "bearbow" builds with a bear pet and a longbow are very safe. I'd actually say mesmers are very tanky because you your illusions mop up (and do) a lot of damage *and* their melee toolkit is pretty good at negating damage - chronomancers with sword and shield were the default tank for a long time, one of the reasons being that they were very good at not dying due to having lots of blocks and evade.
---
Warning: because both of these builds are very safe, it's easy to mistake survival with good gameplay which means that you can end up learning bad gameplay habits that come to bite you in the arse in more difficult game modes.
---
Multiple classes can give themselves quickness, but only Revenant and Chrono can apply alacrity, and base Rev can only apply it to themselves. What we need (besides making chronomancer actually fun or at least tolerable to play) is to give more classes alacrity (and quickness too, of course, but if I had to choose between the two, I'd prefer more sources of alacrity).
---
ikr. It is confusing because if you spend at least a small amount of time playing chrono, you would know that popping shatter without clone is pretty common and important for combat, and even small things like quickness to gather veins, open chest etc.
---
I never like the "devs don't even play the game" criticism, but in this case unfortunately i think it's true.
---
Can someone show me a good build for DH after patch? Open World an Fractals and Story prefered. 
---
TY guys
---
Scourge is that mindless dps now? no weapon swap just stupid rotation?
---
This topic pops up every once in a while. They often use real life photographs and paint over it or incorporate it into their concept art. You can/could also so a guy with a blue tshirt stand around in the lion's arch concept art. Another concept art has neon signs.
---
Dragonhunter is still the goto build. Just google "dragonhunter metabattle"
---
The encounter where superspeed comes to mind is River of Souls and to a lesser extent Siege the Stronghold, where you need to escort an NPC through danger. You can give the NPC superspeed to make the event go faster, otherwise you're limited by the run speed of Desmina / Glenna
---
Nothing changed for open world DGH
---
makes me think of my guild few years ago.
---
did w1 naked. was fun and challenging 😁
---
inb4 its not an idea but an actual leak
---
NA: join the very active [Raid Academy](https://discord.gg/mpVnEju) (that was already more active than RiT).
---
Wing 7 training happens a lot on RA, it's super popular and most trainers decide which boss they're teaching based on a vote
---
I think that's a mistake. The problem aren't the maps, but the stupid story instances. That's where most resources are spent-wasted.
---
That's one of the biggest reasons why I'm advocating for the return of classic questing (with a modern spin, of course). Not only is questing more immersive, you can also tell good stories without all the Hollywood explosions, and spend those resources on open world content instead.
---
If you notice, both raids and fractals have heavy story elements to them as well. The idea is to move some resources there too, and let players visit those places during story instances or easy modes. It's a win-win for everyone.
---
Should ArenaNet truly start releasing less new zones, the game's headed for disaster, in my opinion.
---
The dragon plot is boring, and I'm pretty convinced most players are tired of it. It's been 7 years fighting the same world-ending mindless minions over and over again.
---
There's far more interesting stories out there.
---
They're the toxins spread by Canach which were used to aggravate the local wildlife.
---
Well, at least for the next 10,000 years, I guess?
---
Or until a few expansions later, when someone screws up and they awaken once again. If we enter a longstanding "Tyrian civil war" scenario, the "united against the common enemy" trope would be a good way to conclude it.
---
its called photobashing or something like that
---
I love bitterfrost , it’s my map of choice. It’s all about salvaging and selling the mats you get.
---
Well yes. Again, PvE context so I don't see how arguing with concerns about WvW negates that. As you say, a numbers split could occur and may be sufficient but there have been enough negative changes made to PvE in the name of WvW and I don't think changes should be beholden to a fundamentally broken game mode.
---
I love the idea of standalone episodes, in order to tie loose ends. There are so many of those and a continuous story in a season can't tackle that many. It should cover only GW2 loose ends, imo.
---
I do think that there should be a subtle overarching story across the season that would ultimately lead into the expansion. Doesn't have to be much, just something to make it smoother while transitioning into expansion.
---
The ammount of human female characters on the squad tells me why you decided to take on the naked challenge ..
---
Totally fair! Can confirm I'm not a hot girl, so I don't have that going for me xD I've heard zoom is a problem for others too, so I'll try to fix it.
---
There are actually group content to do in that game. That's the reason to play it. On top of that, the combat is fun enough once you are at cap to want to play through the raids. 
---
When I play FFXIV with my friends it doesn't feel like I might as well play with bots, and it sure doesn't feel like there are nothing to do. The sense of community alone is worth sticking to the game for.
---
Old news. All you had to do was use the search function for "Hoelbrak loading screen".
---
Don’t be, ur art is awesome and I love the little bird flying above ur character and the Skyscale, their expressions are very well done!
---
I would love to see all of these maps, especially after reading to compelling descriptions that you’ve written!
---
Quick question: what do the red circles on the world map represent? Raid locations?
---
Be an actual individual and an entertainer. Teapot is imo kind of childish and caters to the 16 year olds. Peachy caters to the “omg everything is so cute” crowd. Idk much about other streamers. Woodenpotatoes is an individual, he’s pretty okey but he can be pretty boring at times but credit where credit is due, he doesn’t try to cater to anyone but himself.
---
And no, I’m not being mean for sake of being mean, that’s just how I see things. And I get it that it’s kind of vague “be an individual.” It works if you actually know who you are as a person and don’t try to cater to people, stay true to yourself. Just gotta hope that while you’re ‘true to yourself’ it’s also entertaining.
---
I love this idea! I'd also love to deposit Heroes/Spirit Banners to the guild as well :D 
---
^^anet ^^pls
---
I love this community 😭 thank you!!
---
You are really talented, have you used a programm like photoshop to draw it or have u used paper and scanned it afterwards?
---
Im really a big noob in this art field, so sorry if this quesion sounds a bit stupid \^\^
---
I think it's perfectly feasible. If we don't get more content, it's because design decisions, not because of a lack of resources. The expansion content would be something like this:
---
* Return of classic questing, replacing the story instances as the main driving force for the storyline (introduced during LW5).
---
* Six new weapon types, usable by some of the core professions (introduced during LW5, with one new legendary weapon per map).
---
* Three new playable races (they begin their story during the expansion, they can't play previous stories). Race change in the gem store.
---
* Nine new elite specializations (the usual stuff, some of them will use the new weapon types).
---
* Racial masteries, letting you customize your characters even further (these would replace racial skills, and include things like norn transformations, asura golem suits, and more; only available in PvE). Every race has some basic customization options, and more can be bought in the gem store.
---
* Player housing, giving you a hub for your activities during the expansion. Gem store oriented (sound of money).
---
* Warband system, letting you attach two characters to a main character. These characters wouldn't be playable on their own while attached, but you would be able to swap between your main and them without needing to relog. This would encourage players to create more characters, and make racial masteries easier to use. Character slot sales in the gem store.
---
* No new mounts, but we get mount subtypes for the core mounts, including an ingame skill and additional mastery abilities. The warclaw would get a split PvE version, called the Sabertooth. The other four would be a mordrem raptor, a largos skimmer, a barathrum springer, and a margonite jackal. You don't need to buy PoF to unlock these, but you will miss on some of the classic mount skills if you don't.
---
That's pretty much it. Something like this would make GW2 be relevant in the market once again, and as you see by my constant references to the gem store, the profit potential is there.
---
It's a secret!
---
[](#s "Bloodstones.")
---
Ooh exciting. I do hope that the bloodstones return to the forefront of the story soon!
---
It's kind of ridiculous because if someone should lose ilusionary persona, it should've been mirage, who's whole thing is you need to look like you're a clone to confuse your enemy (which is why they don't move on dodge).
---
As a power chrono, these last changes killed the game for me. I have no desire to play anymore. I was wondering about quitting since they removed the aftercast of continuum split, and now they nailed the coffin.
---
Power chrono suffers for no reason. I have no desire to play anymore.
---
What's the easiest heal spec/build? My guild is in dire need of heal/supports so I'm thinking of giving it a go if there are any builds that don't rely too much on quick reactions. Like if anyone here plays Overwatch I'm looking for more Lucio and less Ana? AoE heals, keeping people topped off etc. I wouldn't be the only healer so off-heals would work?
---

Put a wvw ability point into the warclaw mastery
---
You need to put 1 point in the Warclaw Mastery in Ranks and Abilities

My ign is TripleOBlack.2950 if u want that noob tagalong 😤

Next time you will ask to increase the limit of banners guild tab can hold

Definitely means we shouldn't stop focusing on them tho.

Thanks a lot! Feel free to check out my DA - I post most of my work there

wait, has there been any deep sea dragon activity?
---
No need to sorry! And thanks a lot  
---
I draw with a iPad pro and the pencil suited to it, using the app Procreate, which is pretty much the same as a draw tablet + photoshop
---
Those reasons are also applicable to twitch.
---
Although this is a joke, I feel it may feel all too real for those affected by heavy nerfs. When your main gets overnerfed it sucks, I get it, hopefully it won't be sucky forever. One day it'll happen to me and I'll be on the Salt train for my Guardian, and that'll suck too.
---
Unrelated, but I have to ask; are you the one and only Emikadon on MobaFire? Long time no see!
---
True, I forgot to mention that you need to have collected the data disks. However, you only need to have done T1 Shattered Observatory :)!
---
Yeah, pushed the krait, quaggan and other aquatic races out of the unending ocean.
---
the record is around 17 s atm I think (when you respawn from gging to activate the key and doing the jumping), but that requires a lot of practice and grinding the skip :P
---
For some reason I always assumed that was Zhaitans doing
---
If you don't have the time then you probably just shouldn't bother
---
You still haven't watched any of the videos. The commanders who have worked with him have all the respect in the world for him and what he does. Maybe you just salty at Serial because you got your ass blown up by one of his portal bombs...
---
Dont forget sigil of draining. 1k heal per interrupt with no ice. It's so much fun
---
I was so focused on the match if it did happen, I didn't notice.  However, I know we have a 3v4 fight far that we were winning while other 2 were capping mid and home.  Since mid was capped, then decapped, and never capped again, I'm assuming their absurdly tanky spellbreaker (who I typically ignored due to being able to run away from any losing fight while other points needed attention) was preventing that mid capture.
---
Well, you probably made a mistake by getting him boosted.  If most of his play since then has been in Queensdale, an easy newbie zone, he's not going to be feeling challenged.  And because the boost gives him gear with horrible stats, you can't really just take him to Verdant Brink or Crystal Oasis and have him fight there, as his gear won't be up for the task and you'll be carrying him.
---
Just wanted to let us know? alrighty.
---
This isn't Cantha, therefore no thank you
---
It definitely felt amazing to do.  GW2 Pvp isn't snowbally (I suppose Capricorn can be different due to how the bell works, but it's not like the enemy is stronger as they get more points), but the losing mentality as you fall further behind can definitely lead to less motivation which impacts performance.  Or of course you get an afk or dc.
---
They’re warming some space in my bank currently. xD
---
You get enough hero points by the time you're level 80 to unlock everything there is in the game. This means you can do whatever you want while leveling, because you'll end up with everything unlocked by the time it starts to matter.
---
Don't worry about it too much, you won't really need them until lv80 ; and by then you'll have unlocked all of them, swapable outside of combat !
---
Yeah, I still enjoy PvP a lot even if I get losing streaks here or there because there are so many matches in between where the points are super close near the end and you feel like its an even match-up in terms of team comp and PvP skill (including map awareness and rotation).
---
It's better to focus on one specialization because you can only equip one at a time.
---
And the second, much more important answer: There are more than enough Hero Points in the game to unlock every specialization and all skills.  Simply by levelling to 80, you'll have enough points to fully unlock the base trees for your character.  You'll then need to find extra Hero Points for the Elite Specializations that expansions offer, but those cost 500 total and there's 700+ Hero Points to find out in the world, so you'll be fine.
---
And that's why a building tool isn't really necessary for while you're levelling.  There's no wrong answers, you're free to experiment.  If you don't like what you picked, you just need to gain a few levels or explore a map or two and you'll earn enough points to pick something else!
---
I really like this pose! Great job! :D
---
How did you get 631 points? Must have killed the lord to do that?
---
But yea red made tactical mistakes for sure...
---
True, but I thought everyone was happy with the Thief changes? I haven't heard one complaint, but I also have like Zero thief time, so I gauge based on whine posts.
---
well, dragon lore is lame as f... and I think making them main antagonists was a mistake, still by what is set up in lore, tyria is not safe and glint's plan is not realised yet, making it logical for races of tyria to be focused on remaining dragons
---
Congrats!
---
I give away money a fair amount of the time.  30g at random in a map to a new player is asking questions.   Someone excited in LA about just being 1 piece of ascended away from a full set? 50g.  Hang out with a brand spoken new player might drop 100g on them and suggest how to spend it at 80.
---
I have a goal for something small to do for wintersday this year, and I'm almost at it.  Next years wintersday goal I have is stupid difficult and I can't ask guildies to help with it.  Mostly because none of them were in my gw1 guild when the community helped me out in a way, at least back then, I thought was unimaginable.
---
Something went incredibly wrong when the game tried to apply textures I think. Atleast that is what it looks like for me.
---
in game or in lore? Because we haven't seen anything from him in main story, yet we know quaggans and krait migrated from unending ocean because they were scared of deep sea dragon, same way norn left far shiverpeaks
---
&gt; This version of Chrono feels like the most clunky variant of Mesmer in the entire game's history. To explain my point, I need to give a quick history lesson: Not being able to shatter unless you have at least one clone up was actually a thing in the past, before even Heart of Thorns released, but there was a trait that would allow us to shatter on the Mesmer itself. This trait was basically almost always taken because of how much quality of life it gave, to the point where it was made baseline in the 2015 specialisation rework.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I consider Chrono now to be clunkier than back then because we are honestly very hard-pressed to get any illusions to shatter now. In the past, phantasms never used to turn into clones and would also be shatter-able, so despite not being able to shatter without any illusions up, we still had more ways to instantly give ourselves illusions to shatter. Now, we have to wait for phantasms to turn into clones. This wait is compounded by the Chronophantasma trait, which means we have to wait upwards of 10 seconds sometimes just to get the clone we need for our shatters. This was never a problem before, but now that we need clones to use our profession mechanic, it feels terrible.
---
This is the most confusing part. I could get it if clones didn't "tie" to a target and would stick around until you shattered them. For that matter, if clones did no damage, took no damage (but could be targeted as a distraction) and stayed until you shattered them or got over 2000 away, that would make sense (assuming they just stayed where they were summoned and pretended to attack the nearest target). 
---
But this, this makes no sense. It would be like if Warriors could only build adrenaline off of their #4 and #5 attacks, and not 1-3.
---
i hope you are because the changes are trash
---
You're missing out on the last 4-5 years of GW2.  Oof.
---
Thanks, my popcorn needed extra salt.
---
you mean p*rn
---
Bow works alright in wvw, it's just harder to land the symbol and requires better positioning than staff
---
Tbh if they were to make this change they’d be silly to not make that one as well.
---
Yeah but once you start the story the Commander makes mention that he doesnt make it back to Camp Resolve so youre not that close to the crash but youre not all the way back to the other edge of the map.
---
This is t1, where else would bg groups be?
---
Is the game dying? I've been considering coming back (left after doing all the release PoF content and getting the mounts, etc.) but the layoffs and general downward trend doesn't look good. I've also heard that recently released content has certainly been under par and that's there's very little chance for a third expansion or much more Living Story.
---
What's the deal?
---
I think that that's a little unnecessary with how frequently you evade attacks. Only reason Renewing Oasis and Mirage Mantle are taken are because there aren't any better options for this particular build. Having a Superior Sigil of Force is better.
---
Ah yes, the infamous "The Thing" infusion.
---
Totally get it! That's my view on sports too, so I understand.
---
Makes sense! Would raids be something you'd want to watch?
---
Fair enough!
---
As my only viewer most of the time, thanks for this xD
---
The narratives of the expansions are a good bit better than the base game, and elite specialization are, for most classes, more fun. Gliding was a nice QoL feature and mounts change the game with mobility. The mount system in particular is really well implemented. I’d say you missing out on about 65% of the game without the expansions.
---
I appreciate this! I get what you're saying, and hopefully i'm interesting enough!
---
We were initially going to do CM on this, but Cairn just straight up down half of us with 1 single cleave. After second pull we just turn off CM and wait for ppl to join. 10 pulls later, we got it while naked. 
---
Took us around 2 hours and get 12 pulls out of Cairn. It was a really fun experience.
---
Thanks! Planning on this :)
---
&gt;extremely limiting compared to what the expansions offer.
---
That is a bit of an overstatement isn't it?
---
Core:
---
20 Fractals
---
WvW
---
sPvP
---
8 Dungeons
---
28 zones
---
HoT:
---
10 zones
---
4 raid wings
---
PoF:
---
11 zones
---
3 raid wings
---
If you care about story, you're missing out on not only the expansion stories but also the living world episodes continuing off of them.
---
Also mounts, new collections, new legendaries, raids are a lot more than what you're saying, etc.
---
From HoT, you are missing very engaging Map-Wide boss Meta events, much better than all the bosses in core (maybe except for triple trouble), as well as the 9th class, the Revenant..
---
From PoF you are missing a very well told story, as well as the awesome mounts, which offer the best mount-experience in any MMO.
---
From both expansions, you miss elite specs, which are a little like secondary classes to your main class and change (mostly upgrade) certain core mechanics of the classes.
---
You also miss Raids, which are the most difficult (and IMO the most fun and rewarding) PvE content.
---
I agree that in pve its just nice little boon to have, but well timed superspeed in sync with commander is very important in wvw. Dont remove it.
---
The hylek made me lick a toad in my garden.
---
I quit freebasing heroin when it became the cool thing to do, but then I met the hylek and thought how interesting it would be to lick them.
---
/s why did we need to know this?!
---
[https://snowcrows.com/](https://snowcrows.com/)  &lt;--   
---
Here  you can find the builds for your char   
---
and also in the community page you will find NA/EU training groups (I started 2/3 weeks back with raids)     
---
very friendly com's  (and yesterday there was a "toxic" player that one got kicked very very fast)
---
"weeby style"? I hate to break it to you, but the giant animal wings and the glowy particle effects are about as "weeby" as you can get in online games. Other than the eastern themed Stormblood expansion (well, half of it anyway), it's very multi-culturally influenced. It feels more European/middle-eastern themed mostly to me.
---
You're forgetting elite specs, masteries, guild halls, adventures, and the fact that expansion zones are of much higher quality.
---
Alright, fair enough, Masteries. I did mention raids though?
---
You mentioned them as "4 raid wings", which makes it sound like there isn't much content there, but for a new player it's actually quite a lot.
---
Would it be better if I said 2 raids then? I think most people would read 4 as more than 2.
---
It all depends on what are you trying to achieve in the game, but for the most part game is pretty much alive and has thousands of hours of content to offer.
---
New living season is on the way which will include some expansion-like features, but we don't know whar or when.
---
Two years ago I would come and strongly argued that Wizard's Tower [b] has to be a raid [/b] as it's the only thing that will do it justice.
---
After W7 I no longer have any hope Anet will put anything interesting in it; just destroy it. So all I can say right now is
---
[B] TAKE IT [/B]. ANY OTHER TEAM THAT WANTS IT JUST TAKE IT.
---
That gives me a great idea
---
Imagine if the added an infusion for each dungeon, made them drop rarely and made them buyable for a huge amount of dungeon tokens
---
I think that would at least double the playerbase of dungeons
---
I disagree. If season 2 has one story telling element that works better than in subsequent seasons, it's the revisiting and building upon existing locations, giving the feeling of a connected world rather than the isolated slivers that the 1 map per episode meta has brought us. One problem with a season like approach (I do expect more then 2 maps anyway, just not 6) is of course that season 2 didn't really adhear to the "frozen in time" standard yet. Consolidating these two principles is to me the most promising development that season 5 might bring.
---
I don't disagree about your points on questing, but would be surprised(although not unpleasantly) if they would introduce traditional questing now. I think it is much more likely that they will continue to refine their ability to mimic traditional quests with achievements and collections.
---
Finally about the story instances. There certainly is a balance to be found on exactly how much to invest into instances and cutscenes. These values are most certainly in constant change, since they also depend on the impact that a story beat aims for (e. G. It would have been a bad idea to invest less into story instances and cutscenes in the two latest episodes, as this would have likely resulted into a(nother) lackluster elder dragon fight.
---
I do think thought that you underestimate the value of the story instances. Gw2 has a huge casual audience that played the game primarily in a fashion not unlike a single player rpg and for this huge demographic the story instances are the most significant part of the gw2 experience. While I I personally don't play the game this way, as a lore enthusiast I am still reluctant to echo your calls for less investment into the story instances. While you are correct that story telling does not exclusivly take place in these instances, but virtually everywhere, with a few notable exceptions the most polished and impact full narrative and lore developments have come from at least story-associated content.
---
Speak human you imbecile.
---
I've played power boon chrono in raids post patch, it's basically identical to pre-patch except for losing Distortion, which is annoying, but workable. Haven't tried tanking yet though; that's probably a lot more unpleasant without Distortion.
---
It's not about quantity, it's about quality. Fractals, dungeons, pvp and wvw are ruled by elite spec balance. Maps in core game are garbage compared to expansion ones.
---
It's nothing more than a glorified trial so yes, it's quite limited.
---
[removed]
---
W7 was pretty good encounter wise IMO, they just botched the difficulty. Anything else than a raid will be even worse though.
---
I wouldn't say that it's dying, no. But the past several releases have indeed been *relatively* infrequent and lackluster. The operative keyword is “relatively.”
---
The latest content is still enjoyable, but I think that the layoffs are indeed showing through it. For example, the meta on Dragonfall seems incomplete. The final event feels like a buildup to what ultimately is nothing. It feels like there originally were plans for another event to follow.
---
(I am from eu and I play at crossroads inn can't speak for the other raid train groups. And crossroads is not snowcrows)
---
Sounds like communism.
---
&gt; I’ve seen people say raids can take up to ten hours and I really don’t have that much time. 
---
This is definitely not true, don't worry. An organised raid might take 2-3h.
---
Joining training groups, guilds, or looking for training groups on LFG is your best bet. Remember that you can make a group, too. Make sure you're not joining groups that are experienced (Exp) or require 'Kill Proof' (KP). You won't get the experience you're looking for and neither will the group.
---
The game is good. Revenue is stable and if you buy in you'll get a lot of content. If you're going in to play through it and do most of the solo and open world stuff you're going to probably be set for at least a year of updates.
---
If you're looking for more hardcore communities then the game is old and slowly losing that base. There is clear decay in PvP/WvW and now the raid and endgame PvE scene, but it doesn't mean you can't do the content, since lots of people still do, it just means you'll have to look more actively for guilds or groups of active players.
---
Gems are there just randomly, or does it really give some?
---
Quickness always was about attack speed through. It was a boon since the beginning of the game. Superspeed was added later (in HOT).
---
Why not use both?
---
I'm guilty.
---
'Kill Proof' or KP is 'proof' (it can kinda be faked) of killing a boss.
---
The most common one is pinging the boss-specific item that drops, but legendary armour and titles that prove you've killed bosses are usually acceptable too.
---
It's usually a sign that the group is looking for experienced players.
---
I fucking love gems, that's why they are there.
---
If I want to craft several gen 2 legendaries on a fresh account, which currency should I farm first / what should I do daily?
---
I am strictly only talking about the account bound materials like skill shards, airship parts, aurillium, ley line crystals, fulgurite, etc. and not about Gold or anything that can be bought or obligatory stuff (like map completion, etc.)
---
I am having a hard time to decide which currency would take the longest/what my best farming method for dailies would be.
---
Yup that really bothered me. People dont believe me when I say I'm obstructed while standing  in open field. Happens more often than u would think 2.
---
Didn't know you use reddit :D
---
But I'll say it again here too: Your art is fkn insane!
---
Ooooh! You're right and thanks a lot :D
---
It's also sorta new, I've been a bit of a granny with this site so I'm trying for good now x)
---
Thanks a lot!
---
Not to mention they just nerfed it with the new balance patch. U can no longer fire a net shot while facing away from the enemy, and the autos are semi strafe-able now because they made it doe the rifle shots dont follow their target anymore.
---
I'm on jq, so that isn't going to happen for a couple months
---
      
---
Now I'm curious, is bombing PMA/VR the only metric that matters in a game mode with hundreds of guilds?
---
*Actual plans for infusions in the future, hidden in the code, bugged by Arah*
---
What is everyone working toward right now? I really want to get back into the game, but after I finished my legendary I'm having trouble finding something to work toward. I'd love to hear what other people are doing and hopefully get some ideas of my own.
---
I'm not a hardcore player and I got my skyscale a day after you were able to complete the last collection. Don't even raid or do fractals atm.
---
It's really not a hardcore reward. Slightly prestige maybe.
---
The collections weren't that hard, but me and my friends are lacking the different stacks of map materials (diffluorite etc.). And farming them all is so tedious
---
Should probably just be deleted since sharing acct info is against TOS
---
Tbh having multiple alts help and that's not a hardcore thing to have if you're a veteran
---
It's funny how he said it's awful to play now, and you counter with: well it still does its job. If you were to pursue a career as a garbage man, and one day your boss would say: "Welp, as of today you have to work naked and pick up garbage with your mouth instead of in the bin", would you also say "I guess it's still the same job"?
---
I've just returned and am out of the loop - what have I missed?
---
Gonna ask again here since I managed to post right before the switch to a new questions thread (I did get one answer but would like some second/third opinions for comparison): 
---
What's the easiest heal spec/build (for raids)? My guild is in dire need of heal/supports so I'm thinking of giving it a go if there are any builds that don't rely too much on quick reactions. Like if anyone here plays Overwatch I'm looking for more Lucio and less Ana? AoE heals, keeping people topped off etc. I wouldn't be the only healer so off-heals would work?
---
Wait what is this?
---
Just like D&amp;D, they thought certain storylines don't matter.
---
&gt; Well, at least for the next 10,000 years, I guess?
---
No, Primordus and Jormag didn't go into a 10,000 year long sleep. They went back to sleep to recover their wounds. 
---
Elder Dragons don't wake up after a certain time like 10,000 years. When awake, they consume magic until nothing is left. Then they went to sleep (because there is no more magic to consume). One of their champions stay awake and wait until the there is enough magic again to consume. If there is enough magic, their champions wake them up and the Elder Dragons start consuming magic again. 
---
Glint was Kralks champion, the great destroyer was Primordus champion. Both awakenings were delayed, because the great destroyer died and Glint betrayed Kralk. 
---
We don't know about Drakkar and possible other champions from Jormag and Primordus, but we know that both have more than enough minions out there. So it's very likely that both can become a threat in the future.
---
It's basically the same to play now, is what I'm saying. In raids the only change is loss of F4.
---
Nothing else about Chrono in raids has changed at all.
---
Well, at least I finally know now why the OP is always negative about every ANet decision across every sub-reddit thread. Turns out it's just the rantings of another wannabe-GD.
---
IDK I just hold the button down. But I've played several classes now and none of em just auto. Even super simple ranger is always using gs2/lb2+5 and the pet class skills while leveling.
---
This is all just so amazing! I’ve wanted to write out my own ideas for the future of the story but I never really did get around to it lol. But this is far better than anything I could have come up with
---
Really?  Is it any harder for target to move out any melee weapon's symbol? Scepter aas aren't  "painfully slow" for few years now.   Also scepter used to be tuned for large hitboxes, but this part of scepter 2 was nerfed many times, including in this patch. 
---
No, right now there is no justification for  what scepter is in high end pve. People just want lb to be the same.
---
Why did you use weapons?! :)
---
I see what you did here and overall it's good to pick up the directions which were abandoned and provide content in spaces that were untouched since 2012 but I wouldn't finish each storyline - unless you were aiming at continuing these in potential season 6 - again thematically in each episode
---
No one:
---
Literally no one:
---
OP; time to show how ridiculous I look
---
That’s so cool! You captured the bioluminescence really well.
---
Random Videos without further context are so credible!
---
you people remind me of peple like this - https://images.app.goo.gl/NAP9FJa3SUoiJJNA8
---
sometimes, less is more :)
---
I don't think they were "pretty firm" about that at all. They said content teams would have more discretion to make that decision, so they could decide to add on to an old map instead if they feel that works best for the story. To me that sounds more like we might start occasionally getting episodes without new maps, not that we're suddenly gonna drop from 6 maps a season to 2 or something.
---
Guessing it's too late to partake?
---
Absolutely nobody:
---
ANet: We don't like Chrono having five F skills and all other classes only have four.  The lack of symmetry hurts our eyes.  So we're combining Chrono's two most powerful skills, Distortion Shatter and Continuum Split, into a single F skill.  Even though you rarely ever want to use them simultaneously, symmetry with other classes is more important.
---
&gt;What's the easiest heal spec/build (for raids)?
---
Druid 
---
&gt; I wouldn't be the only healer so off-heals would work?
---
Heal tempest seems to be making a resurgence. There's also heal renegade.
---
Nothing. I've effectively stopped playing, only logging in to check if fractal dailies are quick. I've moved on to greener pastures.
---
The charr made me a furry so I commissioned a fursuit paw so I can roleplay getting it good from big fuzzy daddy :3
---
lost partnership for criticizing feelsbadman
---
Making Chronos lose Distortion is a tradeoff. So I don't understand their thought process when they added another awful tradeoff on top????
---
Didnt he quit like years ago?
---
I suspect they’re preparing for something. A fundamental change or addition to professions.
---
&gt;  Festival of the Four Winds should be released during the anniversary so it should go bonus week ends 23rd, the same day or later next week Anet release a trailer of season 5 episode 1 detailing whats different
---
Except you forgot 1 thing.. Sure they can release a trailer, but as thing have been going they don't like to leave you waiting a week without a bonus event going.  So think about it.. 23rd when world boss rush ends.. the same day festival of the four winds starts.. about 2 weeks later.. the trailer drops.. the week after that the festival ends.. Season 5 Episode 1 starts.
---
I mean.....he seemed like a nice guy and had some good advice on builds. But a pillar of the community and had a huge impact on our lives? Doesn’t that seem just a bit melodramatic?
---
They could be applicable but they aren't because almost no one watches gw2 streams.
---
Yes but last year we didn't have Dragon Bash. Having 2 festivals back to back is a bad idea people won't play it as much because they just played 3 weeks of another festival. Doesn't matter how popular festival of the four winds is having it so soon after another festival will just tire people out on the game. Also no bonus weeks don't go straight into something else. Patches aren't released on a weekly basis they are released on bi weekly basis which means it can go bonus week ends on the 23rd, trailer on the same day or later in the week (the last 3 episode trailers for season 4 released on different days than a Tuesday), with a release on the 30th and festival of the four winds on the 20th of August the same week as the GW2 headstart.
---
I don't know when bosses are I just randomly gets chests and accepts my fate as a non-participant
---
You can still get the rewards retroactively.
---
What are you on about. Bonus weeks are to bridge the gaps between big releases they can go trailer and release on the 30th without a bonus week as long as people know its coming.
---
&gt; Doesn't matter how popular festival of the four winds is having it so soon after another festival will just tire people out on the game.
---
I mean I agree with you, but look how often these bonus events are going.. I'm already sick of them myself.. but doesn't mean they won't do it.
---
Not in PvE, but in WvW i find superspeed really strong.
---
Making left mouse pretend to be the one key as well just opens up loads of other problems.
---
So, as a player since launch, I really feel you’re missing _most_ of the game. I personally find the core gw2 experience to be overly easy in terms of difficulty, and simplistic in all ways compared to the expansion content. Both expansions really take the game to the level they needed to be in order to hold anyone’s interest long term.
---
There was a post like 2 weeks ago of a engi who does something similar and they got shit for it. :(
---
Maybe I'm just guessing, but I think season 5 episode 1 is going to be more closer to when they go to pax west.. and yeah normally announcing an expansion before a season is finished would be sort of spoilery.. but not if they don't announce the name or the theme of it, but that they are working on it.

&gt;	Any tips for targetting people to heal them?
---
Depends on which class you're playing.
---
Ohh, I misread. My b.
---
Pretty much all of the scourges were healing, actually, which is why the dps is so ridiculously low. Much of scourge doesn't really revolve around dealing damage but rather positioning your shade to abuse your barriers and pick up people while downed. If you go to the logs that Vincent posted, you can check how much damage was soaked proportional to how much damage was taken, along with the number of revives, condition clears, etc. Scourge is definitely not difficult by any means, but to call it mindless would definitely be an oversimplification.
---
There were plenty of naked female bodies to rub, ah, if you know what I mean.
---
If you replace superspeed with a boon it would heavily nerf scrapper in wvw where the high super speed uptime matters a ton and can really make a difference in fights. If it's a boon then it'd just get corrupted and wouldn't nearly be as good.

congrats on the kill!

---
It is very useful when it's hard to keep 100% resistance and you get chill + cripple = turtle speed. Also if you just turn around (that movement bug still exists). With superspeed you don't have to worry about any of that.
---
Yeah, in a raid they won't die, but in PvP I feel like there's so much AoE spam going on nowadays that they're too often the victim of collateral damage. Unless you're side noding against a class with minimal AoE (thief, for instance), the clones just pop.

For your second weapon run whatever makes you feel happy inside.  Greatsword Symbol + Whirling Wind deals very high damage because the symbol grants retaliation which has synergy with the Radiance traits. If you want to take one-handed Sword then run Radiance 2-3-3.
---
When using the bow open with Spear of Justice then spam Longbow skills 3, 2 and 4 within the retaliation window. Damage is massively increased by the increased crit bonus that you get when you have retaliation. You get retaliation from your virtue skills, your heal, and Stand Your Ground, try to reapply retaliation before each True Shot. 
---
You also get big damage buffs from Aegis, tethering with Spear of Justice and standing far away. Regarding your traps: try to precast them and lure enemies onto them or just use them when you switch to your melee weapon.

apparently he still plays from time to time. maybe he’s just salty he isn’t a partner anymore. he sure as shit didn’t make any money off youtube. no, don’t tell me 20$ week is sufficient. anet paid him and they stoped removing any reason for him to make yt content, he still plays tho sometimes. i mean, his behaviour is very human considering this but i wouldn’t say the community lost anything.

At what point are you granted a slot for Skyscale Mastery?   I've completed all the collections and I have my Skyscale saddle.   I'm at the point after the Skyscale Saddle collection where Gorrick asks you to fly through the a rift.  But I don't have a mastery category for Skyscale and Rift Mastery that goes with it.
---
I'm a returning player.  I don't have a Rollerbeetle or a Griffon but I don't see those as a prerequisite.
---
I'm working toward map completion on my main character as well as finishing up its set of ascended armor. At t3 fractals and loving the challenge. Just now getting into WvW to make legendary armor since it can be done mostly solo with patience. Looking at what it requires, I'm hoping I can avoid salvaging my fresh new set of ascended gear for those balls of dark matter. But hey, i only need to make it once right?
---
I also need to finish up the living world season maps, and unlock the roller beetle and skyscale
---
Interesting, I’ve only found a way by getting under the map, but the void makes me hella scared. Thanks for the inspiration for what to spend my evening doing 🤪
---
Thanks.  It wasn't clear to me that you had to hover in the rift location.  Flying directly through triggers a pop-up that points to the Hero icon and says that you need Rift Repair mastery.       On to the Skyscale Flight collection!
---
You are missing out on most of the game. The new story is "better", zones are prettier, some gear stats mandatory and superior (but berserker still great ofc)...and the living world is offering ascended trinkets.
---
Therefore getting the addons is 100%recommended, exploring those maps is fun if you want to do that and then theres livnig world which sucks because you will have to purchase it. There you can decide to hope and wait that LW5 will come with a big discount on older episodes or simply..buy it. I enjoy living world maps, i even enjoyed some of the story.
---
That being said whatever you chose now, consider this: MOUNTS ARE FUCKING AWESOME. go pop some tags. HOT gliding is awesome too.
---
Sigils of nullification are the reason
---
Even the cheap open world skins like blossoming mist shards have lower unlock rates than raid skins.

Yeah, they are preparing to make the holdouts buy PoF to have not gutted specs, and yet make them all weaker than whatever they put out with Xpac 3 (assuming the game isn't truly dead by then, the layoffs do not indicate a pretty picture).

Pretty much, base armor skins looks average on Light/Medium, and bulky on Heavy, only the light effects are nice but there are similar effects on other pieces.

Well then I hope the devs add that as an option one day! But I use ahk in other games without issues, the script can be written to only apply to one running application. Good luck!
---
Mordremoth made massive ammount of use from zhaitans magic. Just like how primordius made use of it as well with the green destroyers. The thing is the elder dragons werent meant to be killed but put to sleep. Killing them caused a spike in magic released that hurts the world. Its basically overloading a generator type deal. Which means the magics werent meant to mold together. Maybe they were able to control 2 at a time but after kralk holds at least 3 types they all conflict and overload his system causing torment and pain.
---
Aurene absorbed mordremoths magic and i figured thats why she somewhat looks like him as well. But she also has kralks power because she his granddaughter but because of glint her mother she is our ally and friend. Being that she is young and pure could be why she can control the magic or she very well could be fighting them like kralk idr. And now aurene has replaced kralk to keep balance pretty much
---
dhuum
---
You are reading way too much into mysteries behind PR communication. We don't even know at what stage season 5 is currently. It may come next week as well as being at draft stage.
---

---
Superspeed helps scrapper a lot in situations with a lot of chill/cripple because i cant maintain barrier if i cant get to my target to attack it
---
Best class/build for someone that likes to outplay people and have really high mobility in PvP?
---
Ohhh, I watched the first picture. My bad.
---
Did Anet *ever* hint at things?
---
A not finished jumping puzzle in Caledon Forest. It's beautiful, there even are plant mortars (not active) and a clear path to follow once you get inside. At the end is this asuran room with an interactable console (but it does nothing).
---
Diviner and commander mix (to keep up crit chance) is really tempting for me to be a support scrapper but i cant let ferocity get that low compared to zerk armor or my barrier upkeep suffers significantly
---
Festival of the Four Winds is *definitely* related.
---
Literally a festival about the Zephyrites, and their deity just became an Elder Dragon.
---
&gt;Did Anet ever hint at things?
---
Constantly.
---
Sphere vs egg shape isn't a particularly strong argument ...
---
The biggest annoyance was shocking aura's sound
---
Nice to watch!. What's impressive is that you guys still dedicate yourself to push some limits in this game that's going downhill and not switching to something like FFXIV.
---
Left click is used for a lot of things in GW2 that having '1' be sent alongside it would make problematic, most prominently any npc conversation.  I really don't know why anyone's recommending the script.
---
Thanks, I am unsure if I prefer to take strength or arms, but right know I spender more points in strengths. I have also another question: tactics are related to the use of specific weapons, or for example if you use a sword with strength specialization you can still get the bonus?
---
Rev uses staff for healer
---
We like this game and we don't want it to end ! There is still so much to do in raids tbh.
---
It wasn't just the magic of the other dragons harming him.
---
His torment was made out of his own magic. 
---
Just like the Bloodstone Crazed creatures found in Bloodstone Fen, the magic in the dragons is driving them mad and making them hunger for more magic. 
---
Mordremoth was fully crazed when we go into his mind, but the commander and Aurene managed to go past Kralkatorrik's torment and contact his actual mind.  
---
Realizing he was well beyond salvagtion, Kralkatorrik willingly let Aurene take over over his core. 
---
Mordremoth was fully capable of using Zhaitan's death magic. He was combining it with his plant magic to make unlimited clones of corpses.  
---
Jormag and Primordus were also able to use plant and death magic.
---
But it seems that Fire and Ice magic counter each other, so if Primordus or Jormag tried to consume each other's magic, they would cancel each other. 
---
If they were to attack each other it would be a huge problem. We would have to stop them from destroying tons of magic and imbalance the magic on Tyria to destruction.
---
Maybe it's a question of the taste. 
---
However I don't think LW episodes are big enough to bring good episodic stories without open ends.
---
&gt; as far as I can tell 
---
It's kinda funny how members of the PvE/WvW/PvP communities are all assuming that Anet must be ruining their specs for the sake of the other gamemodes. They are all pointing fingers at each other.
---
In reality Anet doesn't care about anything and have this roleplayer approach to balancing now. If something sounds cool they just roll with it, not considering anything.
---
Thanks! Gotta spend wait times on something, I guess. I tried to make it shorter than previous times, I think the result is satisfying. The original plan was to give it an infographic appearance, using an image gallery, but I didn't find good enough artwork, and I didn't want to drag it for too long, else an official announcement ruined it (PoF's sudden announcement kinda did that already to an early idea I had).
---
Maybe next time, though I don't think I'll ever get to write the charr expansion idea at all. You can consider this one all there will be to it, since I'm pretty convinced that's where we're going in the future anyway.
---
The actual error might be useful...
---
Likely your PSU or possibly a ram stick or CPU problem. Try each ram stick seperately. If that changes nothin ... then unfortunately youre gonna have to swap PSU for a fresh one &amp; try that. Last resort... try a different CPU, if you can :/
---
Only been there myself once, you have to break out of the map to get there, but there are (old) videos. IIRC, the path shown in those videos  is not possible anymore.
---
Here's one: https://youtu.be/jyQucH0skl8
---
I think it's okay, LW1 already did a somewhat decent job at it. Integrating the whole patch (raid and fractal) into the episode's story would help a lot too.
---
This ⬆. You get a ascended weapon, cheap.
---
The Zephirite are one of the few groups that we know have visited territories outside the current map.
---
If we were going to embark on an adventure to find  more replacements for elder dragons, they would be a good start.
---
Thank you! I'm still leveling up and have mismatched gear but I think it looks good, can't wait to see whats next. My sis thanks you for the compliment :)
---
"Tactics" is one of the Warrior specializations, just like "Strength" and "Defense," etc. Has nothing to do with specific weapons. 
---
There are, however, specific traits within each line that enhances specific weapons. Strength has a trait that enhances Greatswords, Defense has some that effect Shields and Maces, Tactics has Longbow, Discepline has Axes and Rifles, and Arms has Swords.
---
Wait, you guys don't alt+tab? :I
---
Done. She really appreciates it and says thank you very much &lt;3
---
She's glad you liked it, and appreciates the compliment! thank you
---
depends on which piece and weight
---
Hmm first and second page is mostly heroic dragonsblood  weapons
---
Three beeps means it's either memory or grapcard, since you've ran memtest and it gave nothing of value - it's the card. I'm assuming it's some specific GUI element or shader in PvP that triggers it, but without error logs I can't delve into further speculation. Prime suspect so far is the card from the way things sound, though. Hope you'll get through this shit!
---
illidan?
---
When they made the bosses have daily timers they made it so he doesn't lose his wings so when the event fails he can fly off
---
This looks like the laughing Tom Cruise meme. I love it
---
Yeah I used to alt tab, a second monitor literally will change everything. Before I had stacks of tomes of knowledge I’d have to make my gw2 resolution half my screen so I can have gw2 crafts on the other half
---
Having two monitors now, I could never go back
---
Mordremoth' clone ability is not granted by Zhaitan for sure.
---
1. In Bitter Harvest, it's clear to see that Zojja and Logan were both not dead but the tree could still make clone from them.
---
2. The Sylvari were very possibly created based on human corpses by the Pale Tree, which is wayy before Zhaitan's death.
---
Thanks a lot, agreed with all of this and it was so clear to see this was gonna be the result. I want to add to your list that this change did NOTHING to the problematic aspects of Chronomancer in all modes. They already gave it a tradeoff with the removal of distortion: *it makes no sense to remove IP on top of it*.
---
Absolute terrible decision that shows the lack of knowledge and competence of the balance team.
---
WoodenPotatoes set a goal for himself to unlock absolutely everything - skins, minis...
---
Wasnt that just a bug though?
---
Try going to a city or one of the maps where a world boss is to trigger it, if you haven't recently.
---
Really? I thought it was a bug.
---
The event could be failed before too, couldn't it?
---
I’ll definitely try that in the morning. Thanks :D
---
Looks like a nightgaunt.
---
I hope she returns soon :I.
---
Turns out Obsidian weapons are so ugly nobody wants them.
---
Nobody's pointing fingers, and not the devs, nor the players act or believe they're ruining specs for the SAKE of other game modes.   
---
If they at all gave a flying fuck about flavor confusion wouldn't have been made this stupid useless condition in PVE and they would have at least split the difference between PVE and PVP confusion.  Or does no one remember *that* debacle?  The reality is that I'm certain that they literally could not find a way to split PVE and PVP condition effects, as stupid as it sounds, so they just fucked everybody over.  Likewise to keep things simple they put a blanket design change (with mesmer in this post) likely because they didn't want to end up making quite literally, two different classes in terms of design.  
---
If they gave a flying fuck about flavor, skills wouldn't be consistently nerfed, buffed, then nerfed again, playing footsie around a shitty max DPS balance.
---
They literally stated that confusion was doing its job too well in PVE then they gimped it to shit.  They spent a month doing nothing before finally putting agony in place of confusion for Mesmer's condi ticks.  
---
I don't like Anet's balance design at all, and their gameplay is fundamentally flawed, but your ideation of them is just flat out juvenile and doesn't remotely even factor in how game design works.  It's not constructive.
---
You do realise mordremoth used corpses to create minions right?...which wouldve came from which dragon?
---
&gt; What the hEK is this?
---
Why are these fools are breathing my air?
---
to be honest, if i didn't know u i wouldn't watch ur stream
---
How hard do you guys think it would be to drop player numbers? Is 5 the cap, or could you potentially 4 or even 3-man Xera?
---
The outcry on the ele changes to lava font and meteor shower were higher I think and they didn't change them back
---
This is excellent, I wouldn't mind this actually being the future of the game as long as releases were around once every 3-4 months
---
The pale tree was born from a purified blighting pod and the pale tree grows the sylvari we know and why do you keep bringing up clones when i havnt mentioned one thing about clones. The blighting pods used by mordremoth can USE CORPSES to create minions. The sylvari are also humanoids because of the grave.
---
"destroyed" xD
---
I never thought about that reason ( well I never did see it fail ) but I thought it was some kind of censoring
---
I don't know where you got the impression that I was talking about dropping to 2 maps per season. In one of the follow up posts in this thread I explicitly stated that I do not think it will drop to 2. I think 4 Maps in 6 Episodes might be a good balance, but in any case I'm confident that the Content teams will make a productive decision.
---
Blossoming is not expensive is it?
---
Same thing here, Mordremoth uses the corpse as the template to make clones, just like the Sylvari.
---
Death magic is never unique to Zhaitan, we've seen many Sylvari having the ability to animate the dead. Glint could also create Facet of Darkness.
---
There are tonics and that's close enough
---
Bottom bottom middle.
---
Mordremoth had 5 methods to create minions that he seemed to figure out over time by experimenting.
---
* Out of plants and plant elementals like treants and fern hounds.
---
 * This was mostly vines, husks, thorn wolves, thrashers, this was likely what came the easiest to him.
---
 * Vinewraths are this too. 
---
* Out of sylvari. 
---
 * This was slow at first but once the Pale Tree was weakened, it sped up and resulted in Mordrem Guard.
---
* Out of corpses.
---
 * This was thanks to Zhaitan's magic.  
---
 * His first experiments appeared to be the creatures of the jungle, resulting in mordrem trolls, mordrem wolves and mordrem teragriffs having skeletal features like skulls and exposed bony bits, maybe the corpses rot, or he had plants 'infest' the corpses. 
---
 * Later he got better and faster at this, using fresh corpses made mordrem versions of jungle creatures like itzel, nuhoch, saurians, insects and wyvern look just like the originals, just with a wooden skin and leaking mordrem magics. 
---
 * He also seems to have captured some charr in Iron Marches to experiment on them, since some of the early mordrem like grunts and menders look a bit too much like charr. 
---
* Out of other living creatures.
---
 * We've only seen this with Logan and Zojja. It seems this was his latest trick he figured out before we defeated him. The clones were probably done in part with Zhaitan's shadow magic and Mordremoth's mind magic, to make copies and then put them under his control. If we didn't take Zojja and Logan out of those pods, Mordremoth would have probably created a massive army of them.  
---
* Altering and merging other minions to make something new.
---
 * Teragriffs are likely an early experiment on this, since they kind of look like a mix of colocals and wyverns. Mordrem mounts also appear to be oversized horned raptors. Then he also designed Vinetooths specifically to hunt exalted, and finally merded Faolain with a vinetooth. 
---
 * Mordrem bombers are also nasty things spawned as they are by thornhearts and Mordremoth himself that look like nothing in particular. Well, maybe a bit like Choya with horns, but they are likely unrelated.
---
I've been playing since beta and don't even have the jackle
---
Well I am hoping so but I couldn't find anything conclusive about it. If it is indeed a bug then maybe shed a little light on it may bring us a fix. Who knows? Six year long bugs are not exactly a rare occurrence in the game though.
---
That's a huge difference here. Mordremoth cannot reanimate the dead, it makes clones, so it's not really corrupting but just using it as a template to create plant minions.  So it's not much of a work of death magic but  his own plant magic.  It's just like the Sylvari's creation through dead human bodies. Does the Pale Tree have death magic? No. 
---
Many Zhaitan's minions has their former memory as well. Mordremoth' clones don't, only the Mordrem Guards were kept intelligence. We can also see from other dragons. They either add the death magic power onto their minions or can rez the dead which Mordremoth cannot.
---
They're the clown weapons, right? It's a shame, because I remember the Obsidian Sword being one of my favourite skins in the first game.
---
Im curious on where youre getting your information and how long youve played gw2 for
---
WTF kind of Children of the Corn shit is this?! Kill it with fire before it lays eggs!
---
Have the next current events be collecting legendary materials to turn Zojja and Mr Sparkles into Blish 2.0 
---
Secondary quest is build yourself a legendary golem mount using the same tech that can switch modes to mimic the capabilities of any unlocked mount you have. (essentially an ingame earnable skin pack for all mounts)
---
You may be mixing up things. 
---
Jormag corrupts in a different way. Jormag freezes those he corrupts. Those skeletons are the frozen remains of the corrupted victims trapped inside the corrupted ice. 
---
Mordremoth could only corrupt plants. The other minions he made were grown in Blighting Trees with all the methods I mentioned. All mordrem except controlled sylvari came from mordremoth's vines and blighting trees.
---
Sylvari were made by the pale tree. She says she chose human shapes to help them be accepted by the races of Tyria, and some people think they have human forms because the pale tree was planted on the graves of Ronan's friends, but those are debunked theories by now.
---
Malyck also had a humanoid form, but his tree did not have a connection to the Dream.  
---
Thanks to him, we know that this humanoid form is the natural appearance of sylvari.  
---
Not because the Pale Tree decided them, not because she was planted on graves, but because Sylari were either made directly by Mordremoth with that form, or Mordremoth corrupted some ancient and unknown race that already had that form, and the corrupted minions became the ancestors of the sylvari that produced the seeds from which the pale tree and other sylvari trees came from.
---
&gt; Maybe their strategy is to engage the biggest subset instead of trying to engage the biggest percentage.
---
Exactly. It's like the short route, but then your income depends on a small amount of people, making the ups and downs far more volatile. Everyone making 1€ purchases is far more healthy than some guys spending 100€ each.
---
Humble Bundle works great. That's the way to go.
---
&gt;I don't think that matters as far as income is concerned. Gems bought with gold still came from someone else buying gems with cash in the first place.
---
But then gold to gem conversion goes insane and lot of people just stop consuming gem store products, due to the prohibitive costs. You need to encourage people to spend real money.
---
It's generally healthier for the metrics too, since you can see who's more invested in the game far more easily. Nowadays, many veterans will never spend real money because they're drowning in gold.
---
&gt;Can't buy a skin/dye/outfit/etc. more than once which means there is no way to spend more.
---
I was thinking about new systems, not "resells" of stuff you already own. 
---
Swimsuits and player housing should be their next goals.
---
Because they apparently joined pug groups and ran no gear without the group actually agreeing to this. It’s all fun when everyone is doing it as a challenge but when a scrapper joins and says tank it already raises some eyebrows and then when the team wipes at 80% and someone has to explain that they aren’t running any gear it’s a bit obnoxious
---
Fire is the name of a traitline, first number is the vertical position of the first (adept) major trait in that traitline, second is for major master, third is for major GM.
---
I tried but for the pre it's was bad xD
---
I think Anet needs to overhaul their Living World system. The current one is kinda killing the game due to lack of replayability and rewarding content.
---
I'd rather they focus on new and exciting features *cough elite specs cough*, instead of new maps that take too long to create. Maybe even returning to Season 1's formula with faster smaller releases instead of long waits for nothing.
---
Chrono didn’t get better or worse in raids, it just feels worse to play. It is in an almost identical spot pre and post patch, the only difference is the loss of distortion f4 but it doesn’t matter too much because chrono has enough blocks and invulns without it to tank
---
I just read them again and I see nothing other than no shatters without clones and no more distort, am I missing something?
---
Didn't the bonus boxes used to be tradable?
---
I'm sure i made quite a bit of gold selling them, but now they aren't listable on the TP.
---
Maybe I'm thinking of Meta Event rush boxes...
---
Three monitors will blow your mind.
---
I always thought some of them came naturally 
---
(graham beeing a guardian and picking up his mothers longbow=dragonhunter)
---
That's Zojja, with two J's. *holds up three fingers.*
---
game is dead, at least nice to see that guardian is not useless anymore and ele op, but it took them way too long to balance that shit, they lost me in the years where it wasnt fixed and now the content is garbage anyways (only ultra casual "living" story and nothing else lulw)
---
You can still find his broken wings on the bottom of the ocean thou.
---
It'd be cooler if he turned around and snuck off into the water.
---
Mine are the mistforged obisidian weapons at 0.038% and sublimed mistforged triumphant armors at 0.676%
---
you're already on effi, so why not just use the currency tab?
---
&gt; Patch notes: we're also slightly increasing the penalty for holosmiths overheating, as it wasn't commensurate with the level of power granted by holoforge mode.
---
*slightly*
---
still dont understand the toolbelt skill lockout, as you never wanted to overheat in wvw/pvp anyway, and it only serves to make the pve rotation incredibly simple/boring
---
Holosmith could also use a rework like deadeye regarding weapons. Heat should have some effects on all weapons (and kits), not just on exceeds and sword.
---
If it wanted to target PvP/WvW it effectively missed it completely because you never intentionally overheat there, no clue what they wanted with that.
---
Serial :(
---
Yes the new chrono change is the worst thing anet has ever changed in a class. It isnt even very viable in wvw anymore because the clones die before you can generate more than 1.
---
Do you see Scrapper healer in PvP?
---
it would make more sense if they didn't actively reward you for overheating with the best PvE grandmaster trait Holo has aka PBM.
---
But they forgot to remove/change it if that was the case
---
Yep. Someone could do a 5 hour jawgeous holo compilation and you might see him overheat two times.
---
&gt; make the pve rotation incredibly simple/boring
---
Sounds like Mallyx rotation with the difference that it got buffed.
---
Well, it takes roughly two years - if not more - to successfully work out and approve a law or restriction.

It takes roughly two weeks, or less, for a staff of lawyers and clever designers to find loop holes or change the formula so that the restriction doesn't fit anymore.

The reason why blcs are blocked in belgium is most likely, that the amount of potential costumers is not worth the hassle to came up with an idea that can than also be regulated by the same law.. You wait for a big swing, and then you start taking actions. And noones says that what comes next will be better just because ppl think it is already at it's lowest.

For example: There is a reason why the gemstore is selling keys and not black lion chests. For some of the early attempts of regulation of 2017-2018 (that never really come to live except for china where it was quickly worked around - eg blizzard with overwatch) this alone would be enough to exclude them from the list of bannable behaviors. Because you know exactly what you get for your buck. A key. Not more. Not less. For a normal person there would be no difference between buying the key or a box but for laws and lawyers there lies a world inbetween.
