Why do we only get two slots for gear saving when arc provided infinite for free? At the very least we should have 6. Since that’s the average for people who use templates. 
---

---
It’s really a slap in the face to Raiders, WvWers and PvPers that have been asking for this for 2+ years. Gw1 and every other game provides it for free.
---
---
---
This probably took them tons of work and those workers want to get a paycheck at the end of the month, so the company decided to make some money off that work
---
Think of all those precious seconds you've lost!
---
;)
---
Can't wait to buy 15 different equipment slots just on my guardian alone to be able to continue raiding without the severe cancer caused by manually swapping full legendary gear. And then there's the other 6 classes I play. And WvW and PvP. Monitizing this seems like very sensible idea.
---
Jokes aside, you can't even deliver content worth mentioning for this game anymore and now you take away the convenience we've had for years by a great third party tool to make some quick cash on it? Fuck you, seriously. I'm done. You're no better than the complete asshats in charge at €A and Activi$ion.
---

---
Typical anet charging money for something we've had for more than a decade in gw1. Scummy
---
If we get 3 for wvw 3 for pve and 3 for pvp it will be ok for MOST people, of course the tryhards and raiders who have like 15 builds will struggle, but really most people need this.
---
Pve: open world, fractals dps, and a heal/boon spec.
---
Wvw: a zerg spec, a roamer (lol like this is a thing) spec, and a... well that's about it unless you are a commander and need like 14 builds to super min max a zerg mode.
---
And pvp same thing basically.
---
But if it's only 3 for all modes combined that will be a no bueno
---
Your post is super toxic and I'm probably a carebear, but I agree with you.
---
Gotcha thing is that you can only attach legendary items to multiple Gear Templates. So if you want to use the same ascended jewelry, etc on multiple Gear Templates you would most likely need duplicates, at least before confirmed otherwise.
---
It's hard to tell. 
---
Since PoF, ANET seems to have gotten greedier with gemstore decisions. However, I'm not sure great people like Mike Z put so much work in GW2 simply because they want to exploit people with loot boxes. There does seem to be genuine passion that goes into GW2.
---
My theory is that NCSoft constantly hovers over ANET, scrutinizing them. We see how hard they slammed ANET with the layoffs. That was a show of force: "You better make more money OR ELSE!"
---
... or it could just be execs at ANET being greedy.
---
Dunno.
---
Comments in this thread confirm one thing. Majority of the people here can't seem to stop bitching. Just not capable of it.
---
But do they save separate transmutes for the same armor ;)
---
Under the assumption that Anet would ever make them? Surely not. However, Delta’s version of templates has been around for ages now and they let you use the legendary functionality to the max, unlike anet’s version.  Anet’s version essentially punishes you for having wanted the best gear to free up your bag space/streamline your character in years past.  One of the reasons to get full legendary previously was to get rid of so much ascended gear space. Now anyone can do that just by buying templates. Oh, but wait, legendary gear users have to buy templates too. 
---
It’s really only a big fuck you to hardcore players anyway and anyone who mains only one character, so I don’t expect most casuals to be upset about this. but they don’t even make content for us more hardcore players anymore anyway so why should I care to buy these exactly?
---
Most of the "big questions" here are just inappropriate and phrased in a non-constructive way. If you asked me most of this in person, I'd just blow you off for being an asshole.
---
Why charge money for builds?
---
Gear storage/templates sure. But why builds? You're taking away arc templates and giving us less at a cost.
---
Do you know how GW1's build templates work? Can we get that in 2022?
---
And the absolutely worst thing is that we don't even get the content, where the need for the build templates manifests the most. What exactly am I going to fund by buying BT slots? Next 2h story episode? Fuck that.
---
I think how they've monetized the system is fine. This is a convenience feature. Respeccing Builds doesn't cost inventory slots, and they're essentially giving us free inventory slots with Equipment templates. With a bag-slot expansion upgrade, you can store a spec's equipment very comfortably in a 20-slot bag. This all just depends on the price of an equipment template upgrade vs a bag-slot upgrade.
---
It's honestly fine. What if the feature was locked behind a purchasable expansion? That'd be fine by me too. If this is crossing the line, don't use the feature, don't buy the upgrades. Some of us are happy to support the development of qol features.
---
I'd think that 600 gems is a good price. that's 200 per template slot, the same price as a LW episode!
---
I offer 1 gem for everything. After all this waiting for a feature I feel should have been there since day one, I feel that is fair.
---
You will literally be better off than you are right now without spending a single penny.
---
Are they not giving you free build template slots and free equipment template slots?
---
r/gw2: Content updates are so slow. This game is dying because content release cadences are months apart.
---
also r/gw2: why should we pay for additional qol features when we could be getting them for free?
---
Yeah, but it's more than one. :)
---
Ahem, let me introduce you to my friend *EA*
---
100 per slot
---
Of course the general pub scene is gonna be elitist *to some degree*. When people are pugging content, they're hoping for a reliable clear. People are generally really lax about things like dps being in 50th percentile or boon uptime being spotty. You'll run into a few people who are beyond extra in that regard but for the most part, so long as you're not messing up critical mechanics related (dropping poison on the group for slub, not running out time bombs on sab, etc). Those are the things which are critical to the success of the run and what they're assuming you have the knowledge of.
---
It's not going to be easy to get started, but it isn't easy for really anyone unless they're in a lucky position to be carried by friends trying to get them interested in raiding. Expecting to be on the same level of people who have been running this type of content for years or literally those specific instances for years is a bit silly. You have to put in the time to learn some basics for your build, rotation, and mechanics. Raid guides, videos, and training runs all help with that, but yes it's intimidating and hard to start.
---
Just like with fracs: You probably won't be ready to run with a 200 Ess group right away because they are relying on high boon uptime and high dps burst and if you are dead weight it is felt very quickly and hurts the overall run significantly because the expectation for 200 Ess is for psuedo-speedrun (not like world records but y'know) clear times. You'll have to spend some time learning how to improve first before you're ready for those reliable and fast groups.
---
Think that is kind of incorrect. For example thief in pve. There’s boon thief, boon thief tank, heal thief. Then there’s power deadeye, power daredevil.  
---
For ranger, there’s condi soulbeast, power soulbeast, Druid, Druid hankite. Also you can Druid tank on kc, xera. 
---
For guardian. There power dh, condi Firebrand. Power quickbrand, condi quickbrand. Healbrand. Healtank. 
---
For ele. Power weaver, condi weaver, power tempest, heal tempest (with magi), boon heal tempest (with harriers)
---
For mesmer. Mirage, power chrono, power boon, condi boon. Boon tank, condi boon tank 
---
For warrior. Condi berserker, Core power warrior for cc, power berserker, power spellbreaker
---
For rev. Condi rev, heal rev, diviner rev, power herald. 
---
Etc etc. As much as 2-3 seems like it’s the right amount. It’s very inaccurate for people who use different classes and builds for different reasons. Since meta has changed that mesmer isn’t number 1 anymore, diversity with raids and fractals have changed compositions drastically. Which leads to having different builds for different comps that are very different then it use to be. I would say per class you would need 4 just for pve. Since wvw is another different ball game, it would be nice for having pve, wvw, and pvp to have the amount limit added separately. 3 for each game mode is fine to start. But an ideal safe number for each would be 4.
---
Exactly
---
sounds like a hell of a slippery slope.
---
I have two questions:
---
What made you think that 2 slots would be close to an acceptable number for raiders/pvp players/experienced players in general, when that portion of the community usually has atleast 8 builds per character on arcDPS which has already existed for several years and it's free.
---
Is making a quick buck out of addicted whales worth further damaging the company's reputation in the eyes of long term fans of the guild wars franchise?
---
Thanks.
---
Build slots: 0 ideally, wouldn't pay more than 50 gems per 3 slots. 1 slot is worthless to me, I need 10 per character to play comfortably.
---
Account build slots: don't matter, they aren't unique per-profession, and hence are useless for players that play multiple classes
---
Equipment slots: 200 gems per slot is fine, since it essentially saves you bag slots. But they really should be free for gear slots with legendary items equipped. Legendary gear is already devalued by the existance of this feature, but to add insult to injury, they make swapping legendary gear stats much more limiting.
---
I'm disappointed at such low limits and that bloodstone fen jewelry won't work well with it.  
---
What I think they should do instead is make it like GW1 in having it being virtually unlimited and then additionally offer SHARED equipment slots like we have shared inventory in the gemstore.  Being able to easily swap legendaries to other characters would be so worth it.
---
We use yolo mouse like the other friendly soul said :^ D
---
Yeah I didn't change the meaning, only made the sentence sound better or something. I did it before you sent it.
---
It's not a matter of convenience at all, it's a matter of *additional* convenience. You get 5 bag slots on a new character, a single bank tab, the ability to buy salvage kits from vendors, etc. but it is *more* convenient to have more inventory and bank space and use a Copper-Fed all the time instead of continuously buying kits. 
---
Similarly, you get a few build and equipment templates for free, but if you want more convenience of swapping several different builds on the fly instead of reequipping, changing skills, etc. it is monetized.
---
In your example, waypoints are the existing convenience in the game, while things like lounge passes, home instance portal stones, and waypoint unlock packs are the additional convenience.
---
Legendary gear is future-proof. Metas change, non-legendary gear doesn't (for free/zero time, at least).
---
Why are you expecting Anet to account for unsupported and unsanctioned third party tools in the development of their game and why is it Anet's fault in any way if those third party tools stop working after they update their game?
---
You are literally giving Anet shit for changing their game which causes third party tools to stop working. Do you not realize how stupid that is?
---
Lucas is that what you had to resort to cause we don't have a daily group now :peepocry:
---
not really, they just have to do what they currently do. When templates release, it'll be a net benefit to everyone, just a slightly bigger benefit to those that buy a few more pages. 
---
I mean, I personally would love it if all the pages were free, and all the mount skins were free, and all the inventory slots were free, but at some point Anet would stop making enough money to be able to fund the game  ad hoc and would start requiring sub fees or some other way of monetizing the game. 
---
Overall, given the fact that they need to make money in order to continue developing the game, monetizing features like this are a smart decision without engaging in problematic behaviors (CoD, FIFA, Archeage, Black Desert, Shadow of War, etc... looking at you). Hell, even WoW is less consumer-friendly than Gw2. They've got a sub fee, expansions every year that are *required* to play the game (vertical progression vs horizontal progression), and microtransactions. 
---
TL;DR- necessary evil that I feel Anet are doing a good job of balancing their need for monetization and our ability to enjoy the features they add.
---
I'd rather pay once for all characters than many times for each one of them.  
---
If there was account-wide bag slots, I would get those. But since they are character-based, I don't bother with them.
---
And do not forget we can get gems with coin. I don't get all gems with coin, but I like to complement gem purchases with gem exchange, to make do for the annoying purchase sizes in multiples of 800.
---
can legendaries in the template be used across characters? is any of the build template stuff account-wide?
---
I already spent 800 gems times 65. I've paid enough. If it is 70 then I'll go play something else.
---
I’m more excited for people to stop asking for this and bitching it’s missing than for it to be added
---
You found out about my suffering :(
---
If I'm okay with them monetizing any feature, it's this one.
---
I'm sorry... are you somehow taking away from this that somehow you won't be able to select stats on your legendaries anymore?
---
Any amount is too much. I hope they are ashamed of what they're doing. I will never buy this.
---
Love how this system is strongly targeted at milking Raiders and WvWers, but both are practically abandoned game modes at this point. Why should either of these groups buy Anet’s template cash grab if Anet doesn’t provide them with content???
---
Then all you have to do is wait for the authors of those third party tools to update their tools to work with the new UI and everything will be just like before.
---
build templates: zero.  
---
The fact I can store build templates in a text file to circumvent this feature is the reason why.  They can either store that on their servers, or just store it on a text file in my computer.  Either would be fine for me.  
---
Equipment templates are tricky.  Especially because they seem to be indicating that characters with legendary gear will save less inventory space than those without.  Which would be a slap in the face of the veteran players if they did that.
---
But I'll put it like this.  I have about 30-40 full sets of ascended gear on 9 characters.  If I have to buy 20 equipment template slots to regain the functionality I get with the inventory slots I've bought already + arcdps, the price won't matter, because I'll be heading out. 
---
This could be Anet's greatest update or greatest mistake. I doubt they will land somewhere in between. I hope they don't fuck it up.
---
And i should care about what you'd do why exactly?
---
Oh I'd absolutely want to pay you if you did! Your labour is well worth it.
---
For most players, this system is opening up options, not restricting them. Having a second slot is twice as many as probably 95% of players have ever had, and I would guess most won't even really use the second slot much at all.
---
I swear some of you are dumb on purpose.
---
You're implying it's impossible to ever have more unless you pay, when many other games prove otherwise, but sure, those ANet boots won't spit shine themselves, so keep at it.
---
&gt;That's not true at all. I often switch builds going from WvW to open  world to fractals. Templates make that so much easier. Also...
---
So cause you do that you think most people do? I would really disagree
---
I mean, I could do like 5 gold for a sketch?
---
That’s on arc not ArenaNet lol
---
Not sure what you're trying to prove. People have been asking for this feature for ages, and once we got a third-party solution, people started using that.
---
I don't really see the fuss about it being monetized. We have literally went the entire life span of this game without these templates. I'm grateful to have any for free.  
---
  
---
This is coming from someone who will probably never be end up buying any slots. My account is like 4 years old and I still haven't even bought a single bank expansion tab, bag slots, global slots, gathering tools, salvage kits, etc.
---
You do realize right that the entire reason cHolo works is due to mainly the skills and traits already present in its core traitlines, it isnt reliant on a single GM giving it a 200% damage modifer. Core engi still exists and even outbenches cHolo  hell you can eve go condi scrapper for literally this same reason. if you want to get technical with it Condi chrono also exists its used in niche comps but it still exists, not every class needs to have a support/power/condition option available to it just look at DH,DD,DE,Herald,Druid,Spellbreaker etc. Like stop complaining because your bad build is bad in other game modes. If you want to play power mirage just make your own group.
---
edit: the difference being what youre talking about is having a playstyle be essentially worthless unless you add a heavily bloated damage modifier to clone auto attacks.
---
Are the stuff in the equipment template wallet (idk what to call it) just for that character or will be shared across the account?
---
Is the template slot limit per account, per character? Will the gemstore unlock also be bought per character similar to bag slots?
---
So the system is perfect for those who don't need it, and useless for those who do?
---
Having a set number of slots is very common in both monetized and non-monetized games for a variety of UI/UX and technical reasons. Assuming that the options are monetization or infinite free slots is... Ignorant.
---
It's probably useful for some even smaller set in between, but I take your point.
---
You got yourself a deal. I'm about to go to sleep - literally lying in bed - but tomorrow I will gladly send you the gold over and some screenshots of my bab, sound good?
---
Thank you, so so much. ^^
---
&gt;The only reason anything would be taken away is if the developers of those third party tools decide not to update their tools to work with the new UI. This is not Anet's fault.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cz1rrb/build_templates_only_available_with_legendary/eywxzz9/?context=3
---
&gt;This. One of the conditions to ANet allowing my templates extension was that I let it die when an official solution comes around, and that condition hasn't changed
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/b8ur72/we_won_the_war/ek2b7zy/?context=3
---
&gt;Correct. Removing my templates solution when an official solution does roll out was a condition for being allowed to do it, and any future arc build after any official one is out won't have the functionality needed for templates to work
---
That sounds great! anything to keep me from studying for midterms lmao ❤️
---
It is. But build diversity is also maintained by not making every spec excellent in identical ways at every role.
---
I would hate for specs to be locked in roles as is the case in ff14, but they really aren't. 
---
OP is not asking for build diversity though, but for their favorite spec-role combo to be made meta for no reason other than their power fantasy and in a way that does not match the class identity. (note: specs excel in ways that are not super aligned with the class is entity all the time and there is nothing wrong with that. It can be refreshing and amazing *looking at you boon thief*. But imo it's rich to expect a spec to excel in a role that is not aligned with its class identity, while I'd be much more understanding at frustration about lacking performance in a specs core identity roles. If a scrapper or spellbreaker were horrible at sidenoding this is an issue. If mirage is not meta at power dps... Not so much)
---
Either make them free, or I uninstall the game.  
---
thanks
---
&gt;Items you add to Equipment Templates will no longer take up space in your character’s inventory, **and you can reuse them across each of that character’s Equipment Templates.** Items stored in this fashion will display a link icon in the upper corner and additional tooltip information listing all the Equipment Templates you’ve used them in.
---
Like this, with the added benefit of also being able to have said gear change attributes I guess.
---
And the developers should care about questions asked in inappropriate ways why exactly?
---
I ran training raids weekly for 3-5 hours for over a year after HoT came out. There have been very few times I've kicked people. Even when we couldn't make the dps check for Gorseval, we would just take a break and talk to each person about their rotations and builds, telling them what they needed to bring next week or what they could practice on.
---
I kick people for obscenity (sexual harassment, "hard 'r's", and targetted abusive language.), for afk without giving us a reasonable timetable, and for lying. Liars were the absolute worst. 
---
Had a necro come into a VG saying he's experienced (we didn't care. It said training on the tin. Always glad to get a volunteer experienced person though). As soon as the fight starts we realize he has more toughness than the tank. Which was impressive, considering this was old chrono-tank on a training build with 17-1800 toughness. As soon as VG starts hitting him he starts running away in circles.
---
He had no idea what the fight was about, refused to alter his gear, and began to get testy when we refused to let him play as he wanted. We kicked him and half of us received nasty whispers about how awful we were. There was name-calling and we joked about it for days.
---
For what, having standards with their group?  
---
I want to point out, I'm completely against that type of behavior, but nobody is entitled to be part of a group just because its being advertised in the LFG, the party/squad owner is completely in the right to decide who they want in the group based on player build and experience.  I hate the 'KP or Kick' situations, but if thats how they want to get their squad formed then all the power to them. If you don't like it you're always able to form your own and be open on who can join, and thats the power we have as individuals.
---
Microtransactions lost its meaning years ago. Look at other games other than GW2, how expensive some skins or other things are.
---
I was originally mad that these were another microtransaction, as well as a lot of people. 
---
But after thinking about it, I'm not. These are something that are a QoL feature that should be a paid addition to the game. 
---
What we should be mad about is the fact that all of the amazing weapon skins, armor skins, and mount skins, are all paid additions to the game. 
---
Make some features in the game that allow us to progress cosmetically, and introduce more QoL MTX, and I'll be happy.
---
&gt; Also wtf am I going to do with all those invisible bags? XD
---
Right! Collect random bollocks in them? :D I keep a slot of Chak Gerent Eyes on my necro and Rainbow Cakes on my main for no reason whatsoever :D
---
I already left 2 of my main's bag slots empty after I'd gotten a copper salvage-o-matic (the bags in them went to alts instead). Now that there's global unid gear there's even less use for bag slots 🤷‍♂
---
We'll be worse off because arcdps does it better, for free. And arcdps is officially dead once build templates arrive - because Anet is literally removing support for arcdps *specifically so it stops working*, as the creator has said MANY times, though you clearly don't know that seeing your responses in this thread.
---
I often stay quiet, but this is really big for me.
---
I and several of the friends I play with have used arc templates for years. Although what we really wanted were official build templates, deltaconnected offered a fantastic 3rd party tool that made the game feel so much richer because of how painless it was to change up the build of a class, and thus the entire feel of it. We were all incredibly excited when we heard the official ones were finally on their way into the game.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
This however has been a very big letdown for all of us. Not only do the official templates seem less versatile than arc templates, as they are only split into 2 groups (equipment/skills) rather (skills/traits/equipment/legendary-stats), they will also be locked behind a paywall.
---
2-6 templates may sound like a lot for players who don't engage with swapping around builds too much, but this will have a big impact on my enjoyment of the game.
---
I have dedicated a lot of my time and resources to obtain legendary gear to be able to utillize templates better, so that I painlessly change between the many playstyles the game has to offer, to obtain ultimate freedom in terms of build versatillty. I have 8/9 legendary armor sets thus far. This however takes away that complete freedom I strived to achieve, and I am now asked pay to get some of it back. It may seem silly that someone who is ok with crafting 8 sets of legendary armor is not ok with paying for build templates, but that is where I am at.
---
The many playstyles this game has to offer is what keeps the game fresh for me and many others. I do not think limiting the builds people can access easily is a healthy direction to take for the longevity of the game. People should never be discouraged from changing their playstyles.
---
As others have mentioned a model where character bound templates are unlimited and free, but account bound ones are optional upgrades at a cost could be a better path to take for the overall health of the game.
---
Whenever/ifever "fashion"-templates are added, that would be a more fitting place to monetize templates. Putting price tags build templates very much feels like lines are getting blurred.
---
I have enjoyed the game a lot, and I don't mind spending resources on it, because inherently its a game I want to see succeed and grow. This however is crossing a line for me, I can not support this. For now I will wait and see how the changes play out, but knowing myself I fear the reduced freedom will make me feel too restriced and ultimately leave me dissatisfied.
---
Also, manually selecting stats on legendary gear *sucks*, to the point that it's actually worse than inventory-swapping to a different set of ascended gear.
---
"WHY IS ANET MONETIZING TEMPLATE SLOTS?"
---
1. You get 2 equipment and 3 build slots for free which is literally 1 and 2 more than what you have right now. Stop whining.
---
2. You get 2 equipment and 3 build slots for free which is literally 1 and 2 more than what you have right now. Stop whining.
---
3. You can load builds by copy pasting them in chat, which you couldn't do before.
---
4. If you're too lazy to tab out to copy paste a build it's 100% a you problem.
---
5. If you ARE too lazy, you can literally Autohotkey that shit for free.
---
Stop complaining about stupid shit please.
---
&gt;that you have purposely being holding back
---
And also stop making dumb and baseless accusations.
---
Do you know what Anet could also have done? Not implemented any of this.
---
I'm really sick of idiots shitting on Anet at every turn not realizing how good Anet is at listening to its player base versus other MMO developers out there who literally don't give a shit. They gave everyone the feature for free and even implemented a way to get more of it for free with little effort. Quit whining. You don't seem to realize how much Anet is giving for free in this game and how spoiled we are.
---
3 build templated are actually fine. Not like you can't manually swap a trait or a skill here and there. But AS a Mesmer Main I need equipment templates for off chrono, minstrel tank, low toughness tank, tank with firebrand in squad, Mirage and maybe even power chrono, and that's not counting wvw builds...
---
10 Gems each. 
---
But I know they will be no less than 400 for 3. More likely 800.
---
I'm good with 2 per character, but I already have multiple characters of several professions.  4 necros, 2 rangers, 2 revs, 2 mesmers.  If I hadn't made seperate characters because I was tired of my bags being full of gear, or had made sets of legendary armor instead of gearing my characters with individual ascended sets from drops, I would be upset with 2 only having 2 free templates.
---
It's not like my inventory space is magically disappearing now that arcdps templates are going away. I knew that was a risk this whole time.
---
The replacement, however...
---
At 400 gems per equipment template (the price of a bag slot), it would cost me $35 to continue playing my Guardian and $40 to continue playing my Mesmer as I am currently playing today. Add in the templates for skills/traits and the handful of other classes I have with multiple builds, and we're easily looking at over $100 to *not* suffer feature degradation.
---
Finishing a new set of legendary armor is going to change from a cool and exciting moment to "insert $20+ to continue".
---
The hardcore PvE scene is already suffering, and they're telling everyone left to open their wallets or gtfo. Meanwhile we have no news on repeatable raid CMs, no news on wing 8 other than it will probably exist eventually, no news on new fractal CMs, and the joke of a fight they're calling a "strike mission" to keep us excited.
---
They'd better think *real* hard about how much these template slots cost.
---
I agree with the top post’s suggestions, also I really wish there was an option to turn off player’s pets models, even if they’re in a squad cause I really don’t care about all those minionmancer pets running around metas and cluttering up the screen.
---
I'm just going to keep using arcdps - if I had still played this game that is
---
Nice try but no. Your post was in violation of the duplicate post rule as well as stirring up drama but putting it in it's own post instead of a comment as it should of been in other threads.
---
unfortunately. i wonder why they didnt give us 3and 3 of templates and equipment...
---
after asking for this feature for this many years, it should cost spirit shards not gems or gold !!!
---
2 minutes? Something is seriously wrong. My PC is NOT high end and it loads in 20 seconds in LA since I updated to an SSD. Without the SSD, it took 55 seconds.
---
Last Week, arc didn't work and raiding had never been this painful. People regularly needed around 5 minutes between boses to swap their builds
---
oof. you really don't know what you're talking about, do you?
---
What if you use legendary armor though? It will still take up 2 slots for 2 different stat options even though it's one set of armor. And equipment you are wearing doesn't take up bag space either.
---
Bit hard for it to be a duplicate post when no one else did it, but sure. Gotta love power abuse.
---
&gt; Thread removed: Duplicate post, please check the recent posts for a similar one and use that. This includes making a comment post about a another post.
---
Again, nice try.
---
I'm fine with it depending on price.. 600 - 800 for three I think would be fair, but 400 is preferred
---
Wow, you quoted yourself? I must be so wrong.
---
Again, nice try. Back to polishing those ANet boots my friend.
---
It does.  Anet only allowed arcdps to have could templates until they came out with their own.  When this is released, arcdps is required to drop full support.
---
It's the biggest shittery that I could never expect from any company other than ArenaNet and well EA of course
---
I'd be ok with a 2000 gem "Unlimited Build Templates" option. I want to support the game I love, especially after realizing that raiders spend the least gems of any group. I just don't want to be forced to decide between spending potentially infinite money vs having just a few builds and having to constantly manually adjust everything (might as well not even have templates then).
---
&gt; They have monetized fucking inventory slots 
---
Yet they give you enough to start with so that your gameplay isn't impaired by not buying any. Not only that, but you can deposit mats from anywhere meaning you can salvage and empty your inventory anywhere up to a certain point.
---
Also let's see what other game monetizes storage...
---
PoE
---
STO
---
ESO
---
BDO
---
Tera
---
Need I go on?
---
PURCHASE MORE TEMPLATE SLOTS IN THE GEM STORE HAHAHAHAHAHAAHA
---
Can we copy back and get the 10v10 guild battle?
---
You definitely should,  this is amazing.  I'd pay (gold) for one. How long does a sketch like this take you?
---
I'm ok with 400-600 per. I'd be pleasantly surprised by anything less. 
---
I'd likely pay any price though. It's just gold to me.
---
well with how balanced this game is and how well they do it....  only 1 viable build per class anyway.
---
Saying we get 6 free build templates is just being disingenuous. Its 3 per character and 6 (assuming a players  picks up the 3 extra free ones in the time period) account spread across all characters which is effectively only of use if I have multiple of the same class.
---
It could work this way. Though I would imagine it would work more that if you wanted to just change runes/sigils, you could as well (it would likely be worse if it didnt work this way as most PvE builds are variations of the same zerker stat base). Even still, this would mean, unless you want to drop a ton of gold, you cant have niche templates, you need to use your slots for big stuff. For example, I run 99CM and slot in krait slayer sigils; with only 2-3 slots, it would be a waste to have one where the only change is krait sigils since itd be smarter to use a slot for major build changes, like reaper to scourge--with current arcdps, it is super easy to just carry one sigil to swap into a lege weapon or a separate weapon for the slayer.
---
This is huge. I can't be only who thinks this is huge right?
---
For the record, I think everything in the gem store is ridiculously overpriced.
---
I wouldn't pay anything for Build Template Slots and Storage Slots.
---
For Equipment Template Slots, 100 gems maximum if it's account-wide. 20 gems if it's for one character. I'd always get said gems through converting gold. No way I'd spend actual money on this.
---
I mean that's the argument isn't it? That build templates should have been the existing convenience. But no point arguing on what should've been.
---
Because what you're describing is exactly what would get you banned. [Chris Cleary](https://www.removeddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/704oem/_/dn0eys7/) had to step in to give delta permission to make these build template addons, and work with delta to implement restrictions into arc to stop it being a "must have to win" feature. Did you know, for example, that Arcdps stops functioning if you are using skills? That it purposefully runs slower in a raid instance than in a city? And there are other restrictions for stuff like WvW? No, you don't know anything, do you. But it so far hasn't stopped you running your mouth off.
---
Only other issue I could think of is a firewall via router or antivirus
---
 #expansionlevelcontent because you get to pay for it, ITS WHAT WE WANTED ALL ALONG
---
I don't understand why an account would need an account wide profession build. I get multiple people have multiples of the same profession, but most of those people won't want the same builds on each character (that's king go the point of rolling that profession. The only thing that makes sense to me to have account wide would be armor (so a mesmer can use an elementalist's armor or a ranger can use a thief's armor, or a warrior can use a necromancer's trinkets).
---
man, you really need to work on your "snarky" comments...
---
&gt;The *old* version in the *first game*, which was released 14 yeas ago, had it for free so OBVIOUSLY the new game (which is heavily based around the gemstore) should too!
---
&gt;A *third party* fan-made *mod* has it for free so OBVIOUSLY the official one should be free too!
---
Please stop.
---
Is Anet the new EA
---
best i can do is build template expansions
---
Your friend is right...
---
This isn't about the space. You're not going to use gear templates for the space, you're going to use them because clicking every single piece of legendary armour to change runes, stats, sigils and infusions is cancer and honestly not acceptable with today's technology.
---
I'm not going to pay real money for a rather basic feature which has been asked for since the beginning, and when I've been using it free without problem thanks to delta. I probably can't afford to buy them with gold either because of how many builds I have, so notepad links it is, I guess :)
---
Every raider I know. My guild mate and fellow raider Enigma has 20 builds for his Chrono alone.
---
Looks like I'll be continuing to use ArcDPS for this. I got 4 builds only for my warrior. 6 builds for my mesmer. Sorry ANet, but this is not good enough.
---
Well that's the thing any f2p / no sub games it's very hard to know who is actually even playing it.  I can tell you wvw in general is a dead zone and that was one of the only areas you could really grasp how busy the game was since everything else is instanced.
---
"why should I pay for this when I'm quite literally getting jt for free right now, because a member of the community had to step up to address the cancer that is gear swapping?"
---
use SSD
---
I fail to see how Anet could disallow overlays that can upload text to your clipboard.
---
I have 8 alts, each of them have at least 4 templates, up to ~12.
---
I won't be happy if tomorrow I log in and I can't use arc templates anymore. I won't be buying gems if I'm not happy.
---
Whats the number 1 time? WR or whatever?
---
Us wanting something does not obligate them to make it, so no, they were not slacking for 7 years. The moment they decided to start them is the moment we can start counting how long it took.
---
Buy 15€ worth of gems a month, boom: sortiment of free stuff to chose from coming with your subscription!
---
Select license wasn't a thing when the first set came around.
---
Not sure if they'll make that available when it comes back to the story tho
---
&gt; that pricing is pretty aggressive.
---
This is what I was responding to but I think perhaps I misunderstood which thing you were referencing. Did you mean the shared inventory slots are aggressive?
---
You know what? I haven't played much in a year or so but this right here would bring me back.
---
Which is the exactly a fundermental idea of "F2P yet has sub" games. Sounds dumb but this is classicaly effective idea. But yes 800 gem is expansive still, but Anet can maybe bravely decide to make it cheaper. This suggestion is very conservative approach. Aney clearly can be more generous. But I doubt it.
---
\+25% chance at a Black Lion Key for each map completed, then can sell the Gift of Mastery for 500g (though technically you can do this with a single character slot by deleting the character)
---
Well, no, the store team is very small and would have zero effect on expansions or living world. The store is *very* separate from everything else. Regardless of whether or not they do expansions, the store would always exist and would not take away from content.
---
You know what would also help with development speed? Not moving the majority of your devs to side projects.
---
Indeed, but this happend anyway and resulted in something controversal.
---
Side project can be promising for safety of future income but this is possible ONLY if you have stable income already. Which, Anet do NOT have. (,in NC's perspective at least.)
---
And yes NC did right decision. We are getting far more progress since the lay offs. Which is extremly unusual case, especially when it is done by greedy dumb company like NCSoft.
---
Problem is not just a money for sure, but more stablized income is always good for company and can reduce their dull desires.
---
&gt; Build templates upgrade would essentially be useless if you can copy paste the code somewhere.
---
Which means we'd be paying for convenience if we purchased the slots. And that's exactly what the store is for. We're not getting screwed at all.
---
Yeah, it's not amazing, but it is a total convenience piece, so I think charging is fair. I just hope they don't gouge us on em.
---
Wait, ArcDPS templates are going away?
---
It was back in the store two week ago without a select license.
---
Yeah considering how mount skins, BLC Keys, outfits, gliders, dyes packs and all the other crap on the gem store already cover their pay check. This must give them a sweet cherry on top right????
---
Yeah no. This is profit for the company. The chances for any of this to trickle down to the devs, is small.
---
I feel like this is kind of the point. They could have said, "nah, no option to copy/paste, make them pay for it all! muahaha!" but instead we're able to choose between the convenience of the slots or just simply copy/paste.
---
i'm hoping delta changes his mind when he sees how awful anet's system is looking to be be :/
---
those are 2 very seperate camps of gw2 players lol
---
What do you mean "sell the Gift of Mastery for 500g"?
---
also tornados and the lightning aoe that targets all 10 players are invisible on air djinn lmao
---
&gt; months of hard work
---
why do you seem intent on shitting on the most dedicated players with garbage monetization on a QOL feature that should have been part of the game at launch
---
I gotta admit I was surprised at how chill the FL were upon meeting someone who always left piles of FL corpses in their wake. Bangar is right to be terrified of The Commander.
---
Number 1 EU is 6.800s or something. Portals may have had an influence on that..
---
100-200 single each, I'll consider, convert or card. It's fair for both sides.
---
This is the biggest reason why I'm so concerned about Living World replacing expansions. Expansions are an ethical industry norm. You buy the box, you get the box. There is an expectation of value from the box, there is a standard of content that is supposed to be delivered. 
---
We all should know by now, nothing is free and the Icebrood Saga won't be free either. We just don't know what the cost of the Icebrood Saga will be. Will it be predatory monetization of game features that would otherwise be great for the health of the game? Will it be through more loot boxes etc. A paid expansion says on the box what you are getting and how much you pay for it. Freemium monetization models (which GW2 is the current commitment of GW2 - expansion now or being worked on) are predatory and full of hidden costs.
---
I have no problem paying for content. I am very unhappy with the freemium predation when something is "free".
---
Build templates should be cheap for first then gets gradually expansive. 
---
For example, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, and up to 1200.
---
Reasoning is that equipment template serves as extra stroage so it should be easy to buy from start but far less efficient when bought too much.
---
Metagaming. This will include joining a guild, making friends, creating content, living the drama, losing friends, changing guilds etc. It's the best part of playing an MMORPG.
---
You should! I love sketchy like this.  
---
What media/program did you use?
---
That's what they were implying, yeah.
---
If equipment templates are account wide (which they won't be), I'd pay 200 gems each.
---
Build templates I'd pay 0 gems for, they're a joke.
---
Subs don't make as much money as loot boxes or macrotransactions ($20-30 mounts). Even WoW makes more money from their much more limited cash shop than they make from subscriptions these days. The trick with real money transactions in MMOs is they often add up to more per month than sub fees. Sub fees become a constantly assessment of "am I getting my money's worth" while RMT services or cosmetics sneak up on players with spontaneous purchases. It's easy to assess each month if you want to resub (and you won't need a second sub, it's the same every month) but with RMT services or cosmetics it's easy to gamble on more loot boxes, or buy two mounts or another outfit or something else that spirals into more purchases.
---
Even sub MMOs are moving into freemium RMTs because that's actually where the most money is being made now. The end result is games are becoming more expensive than ten years ago while offering less value, or being incentivized to make design choices solely for monetization (limiting build templates we can access) rather than focus on making the game better and being paid to do that.
---
&gt; The shade changes give risk
---
I want to know: What are the risks other players have to take? We're the *only* class who has to decide if we want to do full damage and lose defense or keep defense and take a huge dps loss. I'm all for nerfing Scourge in WvW but keep it there. Having it bleed into PvE where we're already one of the lowest DPS isn't helping anything.
---
&gt; but little reward
---
What is the reward? Our shades affect *2* more targets? That is hardly a trade I would take. 
---
&gt; Added a 0.5-second warning to enemy players on each shade and on the player when activating a shade skill.
---
Also this is referring to our F1 abilities. When we activate one, there is a internal 0.5 sec delay before they go off. I know Scourge is a problem in WvW but changes like this make the class feel so clunky. It punishes good players with reaction time and adds a feeling of "lag" to the spec.
---
I want to see you draw my Charr! If you'd like to do one.  As one of the ones above would 5 gold be okay? Haha. If not I could add in a bit more for you.   
---
I really wanna see how you draw Charr people!
---
It rotates daily but the time it rotates seems to a few hours after reset. You should be able to get it if you go before tomorrow's reset.
---
Well, plenty of other non-Flame Charr did the same thing. Efram's probably just scared enough of everyone that it kinda evens out.
---
As is should be. Scourges are oppressive, visually obnoxious, and are un-fun to play against.
---
Get it for free now or pay later is imo a stupid strategy. Why punish players who just join now or come back later? 
---
With the sheer amount of garbage loot the game throws at you it is like they force you to buy endless salvage kits. Many years ago I got the ecto gambler item and this was such a huge qol boost. Bank contract is equally great. Also fuck bags in bags and 197 different kinds of bags.
---
For an someone or something that doesn't manage their resources well it doesn't matter how much money they have. They more they have the more they will squander.
---
You can swap builds from your account bound storage to your character's build tab but they are separate entities
---
As far as I can tell, one of the primary intended uses for the "Build Storage" is so if someone links you a build template for a class you're not on, you can save it for later. Not sure what else it's useful for.
---
Here's a thought: What if the mobs are all red because they're trying to kill the Commander before the Commander kills them?
---
I agree. I am quite supprised that NC's lay off decision resulted in something positive. For employee Morale wise Anet clearly has serious issue. They ran into stagnancy and this is not a good sign.
---
I have never said that, so idk why you're asking me. That's on the individuals who said that.
---
what dps does it pull atm?
---
[I made a thing.](https://github.com/fmmmlee/GW2-Addon-Manager)
---
It doesn't do reshade (since reshade has its own installation process) but I *think* that putting reshade's plugin into either the game folder or bin64 folder should allow it to work alongside d912pxy. I don't use reshade, though, so other people would know better.

Hey guys, so I've been scouring YouTube for advice and have probably gone through a couple "SHOULD YOU PLAY GW2 IN 2019" videos. I played the original game and really loved the story/campaign. I like the PvE aspect of the game and don't plan to PvP much, if at all. I'm usually playing alone and have no real life friends playing the game at the moment.
---
My questions are:
---
1. Is it worth getting the two expansions just to play their campaigns?
---
2. Roughly how many hours of content would they provide an average player?
---
Thanks!
---
matt is in wing 2
---
As a primarily WvW and PvP player, I find it frustrating and intimidating to even try to get involved in Fractals or Raids, people are super hostile when you don't know the content.  Like, I have all ascended / legendary  for literally any profession and can spec however but it's like an elitist wall that doesn't welcome new players.  Great way for the community to sustain itself imo \*note sarcasm\*.
---
The Irony is that I've been a very hardcore raider in other games, but somehow GW2 has always felt prohibitive.  WvW tends to be much more welcoming of newbies.
---
Well you do get 3 extra for free for logging in that day. But my money is on the 250 per slot with a deal on if you buy multiple ones. It's right in that ballpark of having to buy gems but have some left over and cheap enough that you can justify buying it.
---
Hallelujah!
---
Nice.
---
I dunno how you walk into their line of sight multiple times and not get seen. You weren't even behind a wall for the first one!
---
I don't like per character things. So I would never buy that. The accountwide... I don't know what I would like, but if it's bundled by 3, I would say something like 200-400 gems. It will probably be a lot higher though.
---
&gt;Legendary gear is future-proof.
---
Yes it is, but chest like this one [Chest of Sabetha's Armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chest_of_Sabetha%27s_Armor) are also future proof.  
---
Everything with a prefix like Assaulter, Defender, Healer and Malicious is future proof in its specific category. Granted only one time, but the meta doesn't change daily.
---
i use procreate! thank you ^^
---
Unless, as someone else noted, they make arc's version non tos.
---
For me it's enough. I like to make separate character for different spec and relate them with their race, background and fashion. I'm focused on a few main builds, so most of my characters ended up with 1 or 2 equipment sets. I'm not the kind of person who have 5 different dps-variant builds, or put 20 builds for all game modes into 1 character.
---
yeah no thanks hard pass. if they do this they just turned a feature I've been excited for into a huge disappointment. i don't feel like a player anymore i feel like a cow being milked.
---
The most beneficial option is, that it is directly ingame and dont need to be redownloaded and relocated with nearly every single patch. I am a very active player and even I struggle from times to times to have the motivation to reload ARC DPS every other night in the aftermath of a major patch. Let alone someone who is firing the game simply once or twice a week ... what is the majority of the playerbase. And those that are around on even more irregular basis won't even know about ArcDps / ArcTemps. So for them the update is a netgain, because they have nothing to compare and at least doubeling their existing slots with the patch.
---
Community: "Why can't we have build templates? I would totally pay for build templates! Anet, add build templates!"  
---
Anet: "Okay. Done."  
---
Community: "I'm not paying for this shit..."  
---
Anet: "..."
---
For real. You should get 1 bonus slot for clearing a wing for the first time, and 1 bonus slot per CM boss.
---
1). Imo the story were pretty decent so I'd say yeah. Plus you'll only be paying for 1 expac now since the 1st expac is bundled with the 2nd one now.
---
2). Depends on the pace of how you play. Some people can be done with the content in less than a thousand hours, some people have been playing for thousands of hours and still haven't done everything.
---
People are all complaining about having to pay for the slots, I assume most really hardcore players have and make enough gold to just convert that into gems... It is like you all forgot about that.  
---
But people these days want any excuse to grab a pitchfork and start shouting. I play like a couple of hours a week, spend no real money on gems and still average out at about 300/500gold at any given moment. So the people that play hardcore should have (imo) at least 3x that.
---
I get that people are upset and want tons of slots, but I have trouble seeing this as anything but pure convenience.. Can someone explain to me how this is core gameplay affecting and not just a convenience item to have 3+ slots...?
---
&gt; For mesmer. Mirage, power chrono, power boon, condi boon. Boon tank, condi boon tank
---
christ, yeah. And not to mention that if you're being the boon support, you might very well have variants with 1000 Toughness, 1001~ Toughness (i.e. minimum toughness to tank if everyone is at 1000, like a single piece of armor with +toughness as a secondary stat), 1121 toughness (to beat a sword weaver), 1151 (to beat a power soulbeast), 1251 (to beat firebrands, and scourges who are running mercy runes, since teapot made that so common), 1271 (to beat condi weaver), and 1381 (to beat kiting soulbeast). Then you have the "+fuckload" Toughness variants (for both Condition and Power tank chrono) for the Desmina/Twin Largos fights, or for stuff like Deimos if the herald hk can't do it without a load of extra toughness. I mean, that's all what I have ready to go.
---
When idiots pretend like this game hasn't been nerfing classes due to PvP/WvW at the expense of PvE already. Or the other way around, refusing to buff atrocious power revenant DPS and power reaper because of their performance in spvp/WvW.
---
This is all speculation, and should have been phrased in a less matter of fact way.
---
People are perfectly fine to be assholes though. All types of personalities exist and form the gw2 community, not just the ones preferred or praised. The reports would go ignored, they are violating nothing by restricting their group to certain players. Please show which rule is being broken by having this restriction though, since you believe it is reportable
---
This thread and the announcement one are absolutely unreal. I think they didn't quite announce the price yet because they want to gauge what people think is reasonable. . but wowee.
---
Arenanet isn't doing anything out of the ordinary that people in the community didn't ask for. Sure, they seem to really be pinching money on this based on the announcemnet, but I also recognize the countless threads begging for templates and telling Arenanet to "take their money" because templates would be money worth spending over outfits and other gemstore shit to many people on here. If you strongly disagreed with those people, you could have offered your opinion then and there so that Anet doesn't think it's a general consensus. 
---
This community (at least on reddit) has always been shameful like this. People barely chime in to disagree constructively on threads where players highly suggest something (be it build templates, non-Meta maps post-HoT, miscellaneous balance issues). Then when Anet listens to those players who were quite vocal about what they wanted, Anet is trash for not reading the other players' minds.
---
When some people who say ANET is greedy or even greediest, idk... it's just I have seen way worse out there.
---
You probably can't eat Halloween food underwater because it has a Costume Brawl transformation.
---
chrono phantasma only works in a dps build if youre able to actually follow through that rotation, power chrono rotation is a bit of a strecth away in complexity compared to something like mirage. Around 25% of of a power chrono's damage comes that trait which still revolves around manipulating cool downs using CS and sigent of ether, again what youre talking about is just having the modifiers be purely in the uninteractive clone autos. Youre also downplaying core engi being one of the hardest classes in the game to actually play properly, core engi doesnt rely on heavily bloated damage modifiers for it to actually work.
---
I find 0$ acceptable. And that's what i'll spend too.
---
Up, my friend but the downward pressure is strong indeed.
---
The same tired excuses that have been countered time and time again.
---
Idk why i even expected anything else from the reddit drones.
---
Most people never change their build... Like ever.
---
cant tell because of all the armor but just looks like a yellow celestial infusion not worth. when showing off infusions take off your armor.
---
Which excuses have been countered and how? Explain this to me?
---
How come GW1 could have unmonetized build templates and GW2 can't? Not everything has to be restricted with gemshop FFS.
---
“As long as the party does not need the CC” sadly, from what I’ve been hearing... they need it still. (Numerically they don’t... but in practice they do)
---
I know that I'll probably set up a second build on my main and then completely forget that it's there.
---
I don't think many of us would want to play GW2 in 2019 without gliding or mounts while everyone else did. It's not the same as a pure gameplay feature, but it is definitely in a grey area between convenience and functionality, something the gem store rarely wades into, and always controversially.
---
except it IS free to play if you only play the base game. Sure it has limitations but all free-to-play games do.
---
WELL DON'T USE IT THEN
---
yeah it's not like this is a legit game feature serious raiders have been asking for forever. why don't they save the money grabbing for cosmetics? imagine if you had to pay gems to switch talents
---
They need to address equipment sharing for account bound before I am willing to pay for anything.
---
Equipment and stat selection on legendary gear is what makes changing builds a huge inconvenience.
---
I'd send you 100g for two! Put me on the list!
---
Putting those there will clog maps with afkers. Good luck doing quick metas without switching maps
---
At the end of the day, don't.  I don't expect they will suddenly start banning people who use the arc ones.  Once again you are strictly paying for the convenience of not using a third party program, or of having extra storage.
---
I like, great idea. 
---
It's like fancy emotes and I'd probably use the novelties more often
---
Theres a .5 second delay on all shade ability skills. F1 hits when cast but f2 through f5 have a .5 second delay so people can react.
---
The risk is hitting a target at range vs anyone around you and 10 targets from 900 range is very powerful, but its too little of a reward and benifits 1 play style of being away from the battle, but therr are so many ways for people to close that gap that it becomes more risk than reward.
---
As a PvX player I find raids and fractals most enjoyable with WvW players I know. I found it much easier to find a community guild in WvW who are nice to each other compared to PvE, and bringing inexperienced WvW people into PvE and getting better together always produced my best dungeon, fractal and raid "statics".
---
Mm, now that's what we in the biz call a spicy boi.
---
Scourge has the most weaknesses of any spec in the game. If you habing trouble against them try 1v1, running away and attacking after they use thier long cooldowns and just dance in and out if thier hit range. They have no way to escape on thier own effective enough against imob and chain cc
---
To me personally, as a very casual player (I play only in two modes - WvW and a little less often the open world of PvE, and I play mostly with only three characters), adding such a number of templates is enough, and it’s very conveniently functional. However, I do not envy the players, who play in more modes and more characters. As I understand it, they will have to buy a lot of additional templates. In general, let's see how it will look when it is released on October 29th, but so far there is such an ambiguous impression.
---
Default bag slots with all 20 slotters is adequate for some players. Not for all, but they can craft 32ers and still get by without spending a single gem. 
---
Default build template slots will be adequate for some players. Not for all, and the only answer to that is to spend gems to solve it. 
---
It's not equivalent.

It felt a bit forced to me. Flame Legion are nice little kitty cats who seem to be openly rejecting the previous leader. It feels very one sided. They seem far too unified under rejecting Gaheron and embracing Efram, and the flaws of the Flame Legion seem glossed over (like the position of women within the legion seems to be revised as less toxic than it was portrayed prior to now).
---
It's kind of what they did with Braham. He turned into a total tool after HoT but players hard rejected that and wanted him dead, so they went all in on positioning him as sympathetic and likable after Season 3. It was character development whiplash.
---
It feels like the "nuanced" Flame Legion we see in the prologue undermines the portrayal we saw back in 2012.
---
As someone who: still only has 250 material storage, used disposable salvage kits for HoT content, has no extra bags unlocked, only 5 character slots, and only recently bought more bank space; it really isn't as bad as you're making it sound.
---
The only issue I really ever complained about was bank space.  Having played WoW for years, having a bank character was nothing new.
---
The stealth detection and oakheart were game changers. It was nice to see oakheart in DF

---
Before HoT it was totally acceptable but since the expansion the game spams you with items. Having one or two extra bag slots and the Copper-Fed Salvage-o-Matic is almost a must have if you don't want to constantly run to a vendor (to buy more salvage kits). Though the Unidentified Gear items improved this a bit.
---
While some of the nerfs can be justified its not that scourge needed the nerfs, necro as a class has a scaling problem.
---
Necro scales way too high in aoe and thus has poor single target damage and the lowest defensive options (no blocks/extra evades on any skill/any invuln).
---
This makes them rely on thier teamates in any kind of competitive game mode and they fall behind in damage in PvE. Thier support is also different as morr damage preventers than straight healers.
---
Tldr: necro has a core scaling issue that hold back the entire class and all elite specs
---
Losing a second health bar for more utility is a huge change of playstyle. No damage reduction in shroud and no second health bar. Being able to effect 2 places at once is a risk reward tradeoff that give a lot of versatility and utility.
---
Moving all your CLASS mechanics to a different location is a massive risk that limits versatility and utility. It would be similar as an engineer that you could either overload a turret or place, but never both and both actions shared a cooldown. Or if a rangers pet could only attack at 120 range and just be a second melee attack.
---
Shades and wells are stationary and you can move out of then. Mesmer clones track you, ranger pets track you, certain projectile attacks track you, many classes can just teleport to your location, or away if they feel pressured and staff as a 1200 range weapon is lackluster. Any ranger or class with 1200 range can easily keep a necro walled out and more than 3 cc's is too many for a necro to deal with. Thats why they get picked off. Yes thats in regard to PvP and WvW.
---
Being able to hit multiple targets is why necros scale too high and have to be toned down for single target anythinf and rely on the teamates in competitve modes. Not being able to hit targets in multiple locations at the same time is so massivr a change it needs more reward
---
400 gems a slot, account bound
---
Lul join a training guild.
---
That's exactly the point though, it did have a shop and yet not even it stooped as low as monetising build template storage. Mainly because the system was done correctly
---
because it's a feature from the first game that should have been in this one at LAUNCH, and because there's a 3 party tool that already does it, with unlimited slots.
---
i expected, and was prepared to be ok with a little bit of monetization, but they took it wayyy too far.
---
When this tech is over 15 years old, and ships for free in most other games, yes, greed
---
and this time the target aren't the casul player base - 'we'll get to you too, ehhehh'
---
Oh yes, legendary stuff works exactly as it should.  But that doesn't mean legendary gear, 'takes advantage of' the system.  In fact, legendary is really a waste in this system.  Think of it like this.  3 sets of ascended armor/weapons is 36 slots of inventory.  All legendary is only 12 slots of inventory.  So by spending all that money to make legendary armor/trinkets, your equipment templates are saving you 24 less spots of inventory space in this 3 build example. 
---
You'd be better off using that gold to buy more equipment templates and fill it with more ascended gear, rather than make legendary gear. You would have more equipment templates this way, and the same amount of inventory left in your bags.  
---
Of course legendary has other benefits.  But specifically I am pointing out, legendary doesn't really take advantage of the system in any way.
---
Title should be build.. typing hard. Not sure how to edit from edit screen. 
---
Sorry all
---
just because you don't know how to play more than 1 build per class doesn't mean only 1  good one exists. i have like 7 just for my guardian in PVE alone, and many people have far more than me.
---
Maybe they aren't ignoring you in purpose. You are new so they need to get to know you. Also people have RL etc or just don't know what to answer. Don't think they'll like it that you talk about them here like that though.
---
Will the build templates be editable or are we going to have to use default builds?
---
it seems likely, but Anet hasn't told us specifically yet.
---
great job, you win :D damn awesome, you get gems and you get gems
---
You think the plebs on reddit who dont even play the game will give a shit? They still think scg=cancer no matter how free of a kill you are even before changes in pvp and how you are borderline hanging in pve.  Just reroll to different class. Too many ignorant fucks here.
---
There should be 3 separate model limit settings. Friendly NPCs, Enemies (mobs &amp; players), and Friendly Players.
---
I wouldn't really care about this feature.  I never swap gear between characters.  Between my weekly raid static and doing my home instance a couple times a week, I have enough ascended gear for every build I could ever want on every character.  
---
Honestly, I kinda wish I could unspend the gold I spent on legendary and instead put it towards equipment template slots from what I've seen so far.
---
A quick calculation based off of my (current) arcdps templates.  
---
Elementalist: 6  
---
Mesmer: 7  
---
Necromancer: 2  
---
Engineer: 6  
---
Ranger: 3  
---
Thief: 1  
---
Guardian: 4  
---
Revenant: 1  
---
Warrior: 3  
---
Total Builds: 33  
---
Less 2x9 (free slots): 15  
---
In order to purchase slots for all my current builds (and ignoring planned future builds) I would be required to spend:  
---
If slots are 100 gems: $20 USD  
---
If 200 gems: $50 USD  
---
If greater than 200 gems: $100 USD+  
---
Prices are listed based on gem "bundles" on the store, as gems can only be purchased in specific quantities and also excludes the possibility of bundled slots being discounted.  
---
How much I'll actually spend is kind of irrelevant. I'm playing the game in maintenance mode right now, as there's no new content coming that interests me. As such, I probably won't buy any build slots. But I hope this puts into perspective the actual cost involved for veteran players. This update, and the associated cost will negatively impact me from setting up new builds for my toons in future, thereby reducing the amount of time I put into the game even further.  
---
If build template slots cost more than 100 gems, it will cost me more than I spent on Heart of Thorns or Path of Fire. If they are greater than 200 I will have to spend more than I spent on two expansions combined. **Build templates are not worth more than the price of a full expansion.**
---
This would be too op.
---
Thank you for the input! It's giving me more reason not to do legendary as I can't justify the cost (2k gold is about 10 ascended sets, which can also be different armor weights for that cost).
---
Do you guys know for how long the sale will be online both for 30€? Want to buy it for my cousin, but im kinda low on money this month. Next paycheck in 15 days
---
Well, they want our money and the decision to give 2 slots free is certainly, and simply, another attempt at getting some.
---
Would you say it would be LEGENDARY?
---
Did some more attempts and managed a 14.960 time! Thanks for posting this by the way, it's an improvement over the route I'd been using previously.
---
I’d love one of my sylvari!
---
Why not?
---
So far haven't rally seen whats so bad about it the way they do it.
---
&gt; It just hit me that this renders the qol legendary gear provided useless. 
---
Not only that, ascended gear is better because you can have more designs for fashion wars x)
---
What about using different non-leg runes on the same leg armor piece on different gear templates, does that work?
---
What are the limitations of this build in WvW? If players are able to switch kits really easily on the battlefield it could potentially be unbalanced.
---
1. [Official sales](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/Expansion_Sales) were pretty common but now that they recently bundled both expansions together it's basically already 50% off and I don't expect another official sale soon. Goon news is that [official retailers](https://www.guildwars2.com/retailers/) have sales like [DLGamer \($20\)](https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-path-of-fire-43807)
---
2. The personal story has a new section every 10 levels from 10-80 + dungeon content if you wanted more of the side stories. So it's kind of hard to say for sure but if you level quickly I'd say you can do it all in a week or two if you put in a lot of hours/day. How long to beat says an average of [84.5 hrs to bear the main story](https://howlongtobeat.com/game.php?id=4154) and the expansions are listed as 30-40 hrs (but only have 1-2 people polled). On top of the main story (which you get for free in the base game) and the expansions you have season 2, season 3, season 4, and the new icebrood saga ([more details here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Story)).
---
3. Open world bosses are very easy, most people just group up and mash auto attacks with no problem. Harder bosses come in the form of 10 man raids (7 wings right now), 5 man fractals, and to a lesser extent old dungeon content (though most of that is pretty trivial with power creep now). The end game content is great imo (though we could always do with more) but it's not a "gear grind" like in some other games. Exotic gear is [fairly cheap and easy to get](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character) and is only ~12% worse than the best gear "ascended". There are lots of minor things you can grind for (like infusions) but you can be geared up for raids very quickly if you wanted and then just worry about learning the mechanics and your rotations. GW2 is also very alt friendly and kind of expects you to play multiple characters. Raid rewards are good though and will give ascended equipment as well as gold and raid currency to buy exclusive skins, items, infusions, chairs, and more ascended gear.
---
I'm not talking about awkard phrasing or language issues, I'm talking about people asking obtuse questions like "Why do we only get two slots for gear saving when arc provided infinite for free? At the very least we should have 6." That's not something anyone would answer, because it's phrased in a confrontational way rather than a conversational or inquisitive way.
---
I just want as much of it be account wide as possible. I got 12 alts and I'm not going to spend a fortune.
---
Buy to Pay game amirite?
---
Wich was the Agreement to have it allowed with Arc in the First place..
---
Well yeah if you can make up examples as you want to support your argument, so can I. :)
---
Do people actually buy transmutation charges?
---
but PoE is at least not buy to play. and they offer some kind of material storages to buy. they are still pricy but very often on sale, so a new player can get the essential ones with the first blood pack for 20$
---
Let me just scroll through the top-level comments on this thread real quick. These cover about 80% of the actual questions above this particular sub-thread.
---
"Why charge money for builds?"
---
"Why do we only get two slots for gear saving when arc provided infinite for free? At the very least we should have 6."
---
"What made you think that 2 slots would be close to an acceptable number / Is making a quick buck out of addicted whales worth further damaging the company's reputation in the eyes of long term fans of the guild wars franchise?"
---
"Why are you monetizing a key feature of this game that you have purposely being holding back?"
---
"why do you seem intent on shitting on the most dedicated players with garbage monetization on a QOL feature that should have been part of the game at launch"
---
"Why are we being charged to unlock things that have been provided for free from a third party, because you've been either too incompetent or lazy to provide them within the SEVEN YEARS the game has been out?"
---
It might be the last nail in the coffin for me after a long list of disappointments by Anet and the game.
---
dude, you realize that the more dedicated players use arc dps for build templates currently?
---
Hm, seriously... "Build Templates" should be free... as it was in Guild Wars 1! To pay for that feels weird.
---
To charge some $ for "Equipment Template Slots" seems fine, that's actually extra inventory space.
---
Whats the point of build storage? I think build templates are already fairly moot since skills/traits arent really tough to change, its the gear that takes a while, especially if using lege gear. But where is the functionality of build storage? Perhaps Im wrong, but arent the only people who would make use of this feature are those that want to play the same build on the same class, but just a different character, because of....reasons?
---
400 sounds like decent middle ground. Players can choose if they want an inventory slot or equipment slot, depending on what they want to store.
---
There's stil dilemma on whether it's character upgrade like inventory slot or is it upgrade of full account (which may need more gems).
---
I find it kind of disgusting that they're charging for extra build templates, the same way that League charged for Rune Pages.
---
Not sure if it's because of the feeling of, "Yay, a feature I've been looking for for ages" then it getting spoiled by them charging for it, but damn, I feel kind of bad rather than excited.
---
There really aren't any. You could go heal ren and run harriers but diviners actually has more options to get. Check [this guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character) but specifically the [mist shard armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mist_Shard_armor) or [bladed armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bladed_armor) will take you into the start of T4s as you work towards getting ascended or you can always craft/[stat swap](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stat_changing) other gear (though it requires the annoying [Serpentite jewels](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Exquisite_Serpentite_Jewel) to swap).
---
They need to make money to be able to run the game. 
---
They don't want a monthly fee and the only thing for them to earn something is with this.
---
Reading from the title, that would nine build storages in total? Is that accountwide or per character?
---
And at night!
---
I'm just going to use arcdps like we've had to for two years now.
---
I'm totally fine with
---
&gt; Your account will have access to three Build Storage Spaces for free. To obtain more, you can purchase them in packs of three in the Gem Store.
---
but I believe that this
---
&gt; Each of your characters will have access to two Equipment Template tabs for free, and the first will be automatically populated with an Equipment Template containing the gear your character was wearing when you last logged in. You can purchase additional Equipment Template tabs from the Gem Store.
---
should be more accessible and work like transmutation charges - be available freely in game since game heavily relies on character customization. Of course if the prices will be reasonable - slightly less gems than for a bag slot expansion then I'd be fine with both. And I really hope they weren't forced by ncsoft to bring this feature finally after 7 years only to start milking players.
---
Oh thanks. Sorry, had no idea that this was a food that existed..
---
Everything above is wrong
---
&gt; The reason why necros get picked off is that if you don't, they kill you. That has always been the reason.
---
No it hasn't. They just have no self peel, invuns, stability or anything.
---
They are literally the fastest class to kill with coordinated attacks - Every other class has major stalling mechanics and Vigor.
---
At launch they was considered super shit yet was still focused over the glass eles, thiefs and mesmers because they died quick.
---
&gt;Default bag slots with all 20 slotters is adequate for some players. Not for all, but they can craft 32ers and still get by without spending a single gem.
---
Those weren't an option for 5/7 years and during that time, it was still fine.
---
Can ascended gear in the bank be used in the equipment templates and equipped if you are accessing the bank at the time? /u/Anet-PaulS
---
Do you actually see the difference? Then you're a super human!
---
You're right I never thought about it that way. I guess I made my gear for the wrong reasons. Now I wish I can exchange my gear for 320 inventory slots. Couldn't care less about the shiny.
---
It s a shame. Anet it s a shame. As support player in raid, it will be really expensive because we have different build and archetype for almost everything. I will just stop playing support class and just play dps class.
---
Unless you really care about inventory space it is a downgrade.
---
Only part that really annoys me is how legy gear works in this.
---
Perhaps everything will be stored within dat file of GW2 AppData folder on Windows and Libraries on OSX but yeah, storing build as text files just like GW1 would be a nice addition as well
---
Arc wasn't a business trying to fund a MMO without a subscription fee. This isn't a downgrade, its a realistic in every respect. I personally have no problem with it and they should monetize things more. This game certainly needs it since it literally has gems to gold PLUS free content with a minimal wall of having to login in the 2-3 month cadence for FREE content. I disagree completely.
---
How many gear sets you using on 1 char? 2? then its fine for you there are players the got a full legendary char or nearly like me and i have on guard 7 gear slots
---
Do you think it is fair that us veterans who played the first game with unlimited Build Template storage and us having to wait over 7 years for this mechanic that arguably should have been added to the game from the beginning and charging us Gems for?
---
You won't answer this question, I guarantee you because you know this a scumbag move. I'm pleased to see it finally released, but of course you gotta nickel and dime us.
---
because ppl here don't want to grind for anything they just want to be given everything for free because playing the game is too much effort
---
Well not much thats going to be done about it.  Considering it'll be the only option anyone will have and ANet will not allow development of a 3rd party tool for the feature they are trying to sell.
---
Holy crap. 114 videos. WP is really into pvp.
---
If you like what you're using now, use what you're using now. This is built into the game though, and carries over from device to device, and all players will have access to it, **for free.**
---
Yes, the forums do not represent the opinions of most players, many never even write anything on these forums. How representative this sample (on the forums) is - I do not know. Of course, it is too early to draw any definite conclusions - we will wait for the release of this new function:)
---
Looking good. Whats your usual price for comm ?
---
Bundle 3 pack of Template Storage Slots &amp; Equipment Slots (1) for 400 gems.
---
Not many people play them or want them, but yes, a few.
---
[removed]
---
ANet:"We'll offer unlimited slots as long as you pay. Oh and guess what, Arcdps will no longer work" big brainz yo.
---
*People steps up and walk out of gw2.
---
Not sure what you're on about but you can just grab any FPS counter overlay and then yes see the difference. Otherwise if you mean there is no difference in visuals between high FPS and low FPS then that is just false. There is a huge difference.
---
Until there's no one to monetize
---
Can we have different skins on the same legendary if it is part of different equipment sets?
---
Anyways: this is just amazing! Being able to just have 1 legendary and have all my professions use it without sending it or using shared inventory spaces are so good!
---
To everyone who complains: ArenaNet need to make money and the monetization is fine. We get a few template slots already for free and it is only a QoL change. If you want to use it, just pay, or use the old method that have worked for 7 years.
---
You'd do better to read the actual article rather than a random Reddit post.
---
Each character will get three builds for storage.  On top of that, you can store three more builds account-wide (for things like copying a build someone else links to you, when perhaps you're playing a different class), and the free pack in the gem store will give you three more of those account-wide builds.
---
Also we don't have:
---
\-Bloom toggle
---
\-Effect cutout setting (like "show only my spell effects")
---
\-Extended FPS limiter 
---
\-and list goes on
---
What is reason behind it? We will see that in next episode of "New community made addons to make gw2 better" (maybe)
---
Yeah, I was referring to the shared slots.
---
I assume that is what happens if I delete a template, not what I need to do if I want to get an item out of a template, otherwise it would be a loss of QoL (which is not what usually devs do in GW2).
---
I mean, if I decide to switch my weapons like I used to do, do I need to delete the template? I don't really think so, but since I'm not a dev can't really answer that. I guess Anet should show this on livestream to clarify it.
---
Omg please change how legys work in this. What is the point in having them when they now give the benefit of just 2 asc armors.
---
I presumed that the Dredge feminism rubbed off on some of the FL. Efram has a daughter. He saw the old strict order murdered. He saw the Dredge/Flame alliance also torn apart. It's been 4/5 years in-game since the death of Gaheron. Elfam saw his leader killed, most of the old order killed, splinter groups killed, dragons killed - had a female cub in the meantime. 
---
I think he basically noped out with fellow supporters.
---
So for a feature we had in gw1, and someone else has already developed for them with arcdps in gw2 you think we should pay a stupid amount of money for?
---
Wow we sure are greedy
---
They had to implement the notepad itself.
---
Don't post if you're not in the loop. ANet specifically ordered them to stop once the official one is out.
---
uh the docks with the bell do actually, on one side u get only one exit point...
---
i joined 5 different guilds and kept swapping them if  i didn't get along with them and joined every pug i could when i started out until i accidentally found a cool bunch of people who adopted me into their static even though i was sucking ass 50% of the time. now i still suck, but not as much. continue to search my dude ;-;
---
2 base equipment slots is waaaay too low, especially for ppl that sinked tens of thousands of gold into legendaries.
---
we need AT LEAST 3 (condi, power, support). 
---
then it depends on pricing - 200-400 for a slot is acceptable, if the go higher, its big faceslap compared to arcdps.
---
Ah yes, because Blizzard is known for their user friendly monetization.
---
GW1 only had focused active development for about two years after launch, with Prophecies releasing April 2005 and Eye of the North in August 2007. The game made money by releasing 1-2 campaigns/expansions a year, at full retail price. Two years after the initial release, the game was already dead in the eyes of ANet: Eye of the North only was made because they wanted an expansion focused on long-term (read: grind) content to bridge the gap between GW1 and GW2, both in terms of story and as a play-time filler for the players.
---
So for that time, if you were an active player, you paid 4x$50 in 2 and a half years. That's as much as a $6.50 subscription fee.
---
Aside from boxed products, GW1 was absolutely trash at monetizing the game. I believe it didn't even launch with an in-game shop, and once it had one it had barely any items or upgrades you'd actually want to buy. For years the only thing I purchased were additional character slots and even those only rarely. They did eventually add about a dozen outfits and mercenary heroes (arguably P2W) but even those you buy once and not again.
---
GW2 is the opposite now. They focus so hard on free content that they *need* to milk the gem-store. How else are they going to make money? The full game--7 years of content--is $30, $70 if you buy Living World through cash to gems. This forced ANet to get good at monetization, and they did.
---
If I'm an executive at Anet Build Templates came out years ago and were free so there is no issue.
---
Fashion build templates??? 😲
---
anet whiteknight detected
---
I know you're busy right now but whenever you're free, I'd love a commission. Offering 25g for a sketch.
---
Whoa I never knew NPCs are also considered into character model limit... This is plain stupid.
---
"30 builds"  
---
Ok
---
Imagine playing raids with friends for FUN. Xd
---
while the progression is definitely the best part, I also enjoy clearing, because you can improve on your classes or swap to a different role/class if you got enough.
---
But yeah pugging is more like gambling with your free time.
---
Actually fot three things, build slots, builts template slots and equipment slots. Two of which are per character.
---
Build and equipment templates in Guild Wars 1 were also stored locally on your computer, so if your computer crashed or you deleted the related folder for some reason you lost every single one of your templates. Surely having the security of keeping them even if your computer dies is worth something?
---
&gt; Being able to just have 1 legendary and have all my professions use it without sending it or using shared inventory spaces are so good!
---
That would be pretty powerful if it worked that way.  Unfortunately I don't think it does.
---
I’ve been in the guild for about 5 months now lol I’m not new.. but I’m looking for a new guild
---
i think you misspelled soldiers
---
You have some problems on your end....2 minutes is definetly not normal. If your computer is high end, your network is dying. How much ping do you have? Run the network diag tool in your game folder.   
---
Last time I had 2 minute loading screens(+400 ping), the ISP had to reset some shit on their end before it went back to 7ish sec. 🤔
---
Monthly engine pass
---
Well, you could add a prompt that says "Removing this item is not possible". On the plus side, having a Template with trinkets only would be insanely valueable, cuz it's the most common items to be swapped between characters.
---
Are you doing something other than critizing it in random post or not buying these kinds of microtransactions?
---
Because to me is little funny that they wanna gems for every additional slot for each one.
---
So I stated, that they should only charge for account wide to begin with, and rest should be for free. But I am not stupid and I know that they will not do that, so I really want that prices to be reasonable as fuck or potentialy good system will be destroyed by corporate decision big way.
---
But you have point I just missing one sentece after my first opinion.
---
Not exactly the question of the post, but what I would like to see is this:
---
- Want to share Ascended Gear? - Unequip and send it via bank/shared slot to your toon.
---
- Want to share Legendary Gear? - Jup, available to all classes with the correct Gear weight, without the hassle of unequipping and equipping.
---
This would be a way to not invalidate the work people put in to get legendary gear, and a huge qol improvment for any vet with toons.
---
(I don't own any legendary gear yet, but I just think it would be fair for the people who went through the troubles of getting it.)
---
On actual topic question, with mentioned improvement:
---
- Per character build slots:  
---
If they are shared amongst PvE, WvW and PvP - 5gems, max.  
---
If they are seperate per gamemode - 50-200g is ok, because they provide a keybind to switch gear; which will probably mostly affect the speed runners. (You can just store strings for not on the fly switching, so you really only pay for a quick keybind.) And tbh, probably no one will buy them anyway, because the people that could use this feature have learned to be quick about switching their traitlines without arcdps templates.
---
- Per Account Build Slots: ? 0 Gems, because what am I going to use them for?
---
- Equipment slots:  
---
250-400gems? Can't really tell yet if I'd actually buy them at that price. 
---
(And it sucks for any Mesmer Main; who does a lot of content. Everyone I know who mains Mesmer has at least 3 completely different sets(unless legandary), plus some other runes, plus some other weapons etc. to get them to around 20 templates..)
---
&gt;if I decide to switch my weapons like I used to do, do I need to delete the template?
---
No because the gear eaten by a template can be used by that character in any other template or spot it said. It just cant be used by other characters, that is what i understood.
---
corporationism\*

in capitalism, companies care about their clients, cause they can look for other companies products if they're unsatisfied. and many unsatisfied customers of gw2 already elft to poe, classic wow, ff14 and so on. they retargeted for pure casuals, sure. 
---
but here's a problem. casuals can buy glider or mount skins, but most of them dont give a fck about build templates - they just run in 1 set of gear in their open world trains. its veteran raiders/wvw players that care about build templates, which were free for a long time thanks to delta arcdps templates. only free 2 gear templates and limited trait/skills templates are freakin faceslap
---
you are trying too hard.
---
What I'm using now will be discontinued because of this update.
---
well you can get an usb stick for 1 dollar, so to save those on a stick was much cheaper than the gemstore prices will be. So no, its not worth something
---
Yes, how dare I not hate on everything?
---
That's just, like, your opinion, man...
---
at this point its save to say gw2 just is a downgrade from gw1
---
yeah, definitely the 5 minutes i need to restore those in some case that might never happened.
---
YEEEEEEEEEEEEES
---
I am for sure not buying them. Criticizing and shaming them in public increases the likelihood of other people seeing and agreeing with the criticism and refusing to buy them too, which, hopefully, will ultimately result in making a dent big enough to reconsider such practises. Or at least a worsening of player-developer relations, which could fuel the same process. That's the least I can do.
---
arc build templates won't be bannable
---
the agreement was to let them die. you can use them as much as you like after the build templates patch but deltaconnected won't be able to push updates. that means if anet makes some change that permanently crashes arcdps, deltaconnected won't be allowed to fix it.
---
Pack of 3 will prolly be 800...
---
grinding is fine, but not for something like build templates. I am fine with the gemstore, expect some parts are a bit expensive like bagslots. But paying for buildtemplates is just bs because we had a working system.
---
This is truly sad. I prefer your version by far!
---
Exactly. This has always been a 'nice to have' thing.
---
You mean the gemstore prices that you can completely pay for by simply playing the game and convert gold to gems?
---
It might not be worth something for YOU, but a back-up system is by definition worth something, even if you personally might not value it.
---
GW1 had them for free and as many as you want. This is 7 years after the game has been out and something we have been asking for since day 1. They are basically slapping us in the face with this.
---
you can literally save that file in your gmail account, drive whatever you use for cloud storage, not even 1 dollar
---
Storage is immensely cheap. I'm guessing the build template will be at most a 100 character ASCII string. That's a kiloByte. Multiply that with 10 million players (generous), and you get 10GB. I'm sure ArenaNet could afford at least the 100 dollars to get a Terabyte hard drive which would last them the entire lifetime of Guild Wars 2.
---
Build templates are 7 years late and they should have been free.
---
Where was that announcement?
---
Dude you have no fucking idea, WHAT is greed in game industry, GW2 is still pretty weak with their monetization
---
You are trying to justify templates being monetized because they are saved in the cloud, that's pushing it, most settings already are stored in Arenanet's servers, like sound options and keybinds.
---
Across alts, not on one...
---
Which is quite irrelevant to my point. I said nothing at all about it costing much or anything at all. I simply pointed out that the system in GW1 that people seem to bring up, did have its flaws.
---
&gt;Do you think it is fair that us veterans who played the first game with unlimited Build Template storage and us having to wait over 7 years for this mechanic that arguably should have existed in the game from the beginning and charging us Gems for more slots?
---
Yes.
---
I don't either ... except my "reasonable free amount" is higher.
---
We're numerous to have between 5 to 10 builds for several characters, and they're all useful, not just for flavor.
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Both you and me know how it goes - anet will avoid these questions while pointing to the rude ones, ignoring the substantiated criticism and normally worded questions that ask the same thing.
---
I had split into using several characters for different builds a while ago so I could play with more races/looks and have more places to park alts for doing things, so only having a few slots across 3 or so copies of each class is not really a problem for me.
---
I think if we either had more slots to begin with, or that new templates for single characters are cheap/easy to stack then it would be less of a problem. I want to see the final prices on these, and if they have unlocks per character/per account or both before I decide just how sharp my pitchfork should be.
---
Also kind of a shit meme. People who play multiple roles tend to do so across multiple professions so its not really killing them (Unless they do WvW and PvE at the same time in which case RIP), and people who aren't that beat up about it are far from monobuild players, 3 builds per character covers plenty by itself if they're just doing PvE.
---
You have a very small window of time before the game/vision actually responds to you. Some seem a bit more reactive than others, the first one you can get away with it a bit more.
---
Would voice unpopular opinion.
---
Build templates should be totally free unlimited feature.
---
Equipment Templates should be in-game character progression unlocked through quests and some symbolic fixed gold price if you want a lot of them, like 10 runes of holding per slot.
---
I'd pay 50-100 gems for one slot per character, with unlimited slots.
---
700 to unlock +1 slot on all chars.
---
make gear (stats) a mastery
---
And you know what? You can do exactly that. You do get free slots that you can use and then save the rest locally (or in a cloud storage) and pick them out when needed.
---
You are aware that you can have unlimited amount of build templates stored in a text file and just copy them into the free slots when needed, right?
---
Efram says that the Flame Legion charrs in Grothmar are the part of the Flame Legion that wants peace. I'm pretty sure there are a LOT of Flame Legion "renegades" out there, who don't want peace at all and still follow the old Gaheron ways.
---
That's like saying, dude, chill, you just have cancer. At least you don't have AIDS!
---
I've also got all legendaries, but I'll have to manually swap stats everytime I need to switch because each instance of legendary stats still costs one equipment template. :(
---
&gt; Of course the general pub scene is gonna be elitist to some degree.
---
I swear to god the word elitist gets thrown around so lightly in this game. Wanting to win fights and kill bosses is seen as elitist nowadays.
---
GW1 was not pay to win game like Guild Wars 2. You could not buy 
---
"raids" or other in-game goods there with direct transfer of real world cash through gemstore.
---
GW1 was fair priced and complete game in the box with online functionality. Guild Wasr 2 is pay to play, pay to win, pay to look good on top of "reasonable" by modern gaming gambling simulator.
---
Thank you! I hope I find a guild that’s like that! :)
---
I’m secretly hoping ArenaNet announces that they will scrap this whole idea due to the community reaction. It’ll be hilarious.
---
I'd interested in commissioning you whenever your available. Feel free to message me when you are; your art looks great!
---
That seems like a ridiculously high number of builds. If they're storing these on their own servers, they would want to discourage people from making massive amounts of arbitrary builds. An associated fee would do that, and pass the costs associated with the system to those who use it the most, rather than those who only use it as a minor convenience.
---
Equipment Templates can also record the customization of legendary items, which can freely change attributes and upgrades. You can equip a single legendary item to multiple Equipment Templates with different attributes and upgrade choices for each.
---
10 runes of holding bro.
---
GW1 was Buy2Play too and build and equipment templates were free.
---
I log in twice a week and raid with my static.  Whats the problem with that?
---
How do you check this?
---
Congrats, man.
---
Build templates in this case are more like build save slots. You put in your own build and save it to a template
---
Poor small indie company Anet...
---
I want a bank contract so badly.  Ugh, must acquire an insane amount of gold...
---
I kept reading many threads about people getting "scammed" and not receiving anything in secret toymaker. Which is not necessary bad as it's nice to send someone a gift, but it's much more awesome to send and receive something :D
---
I know this is not possible to guarantee but it's been the thing that kept me away from it.
---
Anyway it's always nice to read on reddit what others received.
---
Will you consider giving 3 equipment templates for every character instead of two? Each class has two elite specializations and  their core. Each class has traits and builds that focuses on condi, power, support. It just feels weird for you to only give us 2. Unless the main reason is you are hoping everyone is going to buy a third.
---
But you could also have several ascended items in each of these tabs configured differently, and you’d have the same advantage. 
---
The difference is that an ascended armour piece is about 6x cheaper than a legendary piece, and you can only have 6 equipment tabs at most. 
---
You can’t even break even and make legendary armor worth it monetarily.
---
You can also store 787890 individual armor pieces in your templates 🙄 no advantage for leggy
---
&gt; what's the gem price for all slots.
---
definitely a burning question for me. I don't necessarily have an issue with it - but if it costs as much as shared inventory slots, that's fucked.
---
You forgot to mention the Living world Season 2 to 4 ^^
---
&gt;  ...but i do find it weird that most comments basically call him an idiot...
---
OP's has willfully ignored all of the spec synergy it has with condi, how evades, vigor and ambushes work into and heavily favour condi over power and traits and utilities that are condi focused. All the while saying its not a condi spec. They even wave away that the mirage rune/headpiece/axes are all condi stats like the design intent and direction behind it all has no bearing on anything. 
---
OP has done so much fighting that mirage is not a condi spec they cant back down now or they would have to admit that they were wrong and made a ass of themselves. Its unfortunate (and frustrating) to see something like this play out.
---
What a joke. Even mobile games are more fair about these things.
---
How do you justify releasing a badly designed and monetized version of a feature players already had available for a couple of years?
---
How come apples are different from oranges? Both are fruit! Because GW1 and GW2 are two completely different games with a decade between them. GW2 is bigger, Anet is bigger, the monetisation system is different, the times are different, the playerbase is different. These games share nothing but the name and lore.
---
yes but you would also need  787890  runes and infusions
---
It wasn't if you frequently ran train content and also carried more than one build on you at the time. Especially in the days before unidentified gear, and absolute 250 cap on material storage. 
---
100 slots disappeared in a heartbeat, and that was even WITH my infinite salvage kits, TP express and merchant, which is more inventory-management tools than I'd expect the average player to be carrying around.
---
Capitalism being shit doesn't mean we should all throw up our hands and just accept it whenever a company does something shit, my dude. I don't think anyone is surprised, just incredibly disappointed.
---
Yeah, I just wish there was something else they could do, to help relieve that issue. Like, if it's a legendary, you have an option similar to "add to wardrobe" that moves the legendary into a tab specifically for builds, and it just stays in there, and you can equip it, but no longer have it in your inventory. I'm pretty sure people would hate it, but something like that would be so nice.
---
Can we buy more equipment templates then or is two a hard limit that cannot be extended?
---
You would need 6 at most, and 6 ascended pieces cost as much as 1 legendary piece (with less work required in raids/wvw/spvp).  
---
You’re better off having more ascended sets.
---
because of what you mention is that I find this system so good, I will probably be doing the same as you. Also finally finding a use for the tons of ascended gear boxes that I have laying around as a result of doing fractals.
---
Somewhat, but I still safe on equipment slots, never have to grind for new stat combos ever again and got fucking cool skins on top of it.
---
Fully with you on that.
---
Yes I guess another question for me is oc k buy more build slots are they accoubtcwode or character. As I would love to buy a few more across the account.
---
Yeah we'll have to see how it actually rolls out and what will they fix/add later on. It certainly would be smart to add a legendary spot to items templates to be acc bound and to make legendary gear usefull beyond the skin and aura.
---
As for your reply to a stats swap. I use curent templates and I still have to bag a couple of asc sets while guard takes 30s to be ready for anything in wvw, pve, raids, fotm. Still have to have plethora of runes around though.
---
Also when refering to stat swap its for literally ANY build. If something new comes out you'd have to spend xx:xx time to get gear mats etc.
---
I know you're getting swarmed with comments, so I'll keep this brief: did you consider not fixing that problem at all and just let players break their template if they want to? Prompt them with a '[gear] is already in use in [other character's name] template. It will not be available anymore for [other character's name] template if you proceed. y/n?" and be done with it.
---
stop undervaluing your work dude. 50 gold at the very minimum.
---
I must be playing the game wrong, because I swap the legendary gear appearance away, and hate having my inventory filled with gear for different builds (to the point that I've been gearing different characters of the same class for different purposes)
---
I don't think that Legendary gear will lose its QoL value.
---
Ascended gear is cheaper than legendary gear for sure but you still have the ability to switch the attributes, runes and infusions on the fly  instead of having a single set for each of the attribute combos that you use as well as infusions and runes or you would have to change the stats through the mystic forge and extract the infusions and runes from the ascended gear.
---
legendary gear replaces the need to have multiple ascended gear sets and it is also future proof. With any balance patch a attribute combination could be replaced with a different one which would mean you have to either get a new set of ascended gear or change the combination through the mystic forge which takes resources. With legendary gear you only need one set for everything really.
---
U give them too much credit. That would require some actual work, and forward thinking.
---
oh so I got it completely wrong, my bad. If that's the case then build templates and equipment templates will be sold separately? if so that's extremely greedy from anet.
---
&gt; For now this game's income is super unstable - for NC's perspective at least - and this is not a good monetization model, which is one of reason why development speed of this game is far slower than that of Joko's sanity improvement.
---
yeah, no. 
---
first: they have bad management and shuffling ppl around all the time. thats why the output is "slow"
---
second: the income isnt unstable. look at all the graphs and it shows you that they are nearly on the same level for 3 years now. so the model works and it gives them steady income.
---
third: to change the model this late in the game to what gamers consider atm consider the "worse" model, would really kill the game.
---
so are people going to get banned for using the arcdps one? since it sounds like its better
---
Maybe you should have donated at least few bucks to Delta then. He spent his time on it.
---
what do you want legendaries to do instead?
---
7 years to implement a feature that has been begged for since launch, and then they have the nerve to cap you at 2 equipment templates unless you shell out for gems.
---
Thats reasonable
---
Yea, maybe. Maybe it is just time to let go Anet just like I let go EA a decade ago.
---
Did you download the game in the whole, or hit "play" when download meter reached "playable"?
---
The only reason you use Legendary Armor right now is because of Arcs Templates. Otherwise it takes three times the clicks and alot more time, thanks to scrolling the stats, to switch stats. With multiple Ascended sets its just one click in the equipment tab for each piece. 
---
Not only that. You also lose the chance to have a different look for each your stats if you use a legy.
---
All in all Iam rather angry that I'll have to pay for a service that won't benefit me fully, because legy armor doesn't have the "out of your inventory" advantage.
---
I always let it finish its downloads to completion
---
Wouldn't doubt it.
---
Highest priority was probably new shit in the Gemstore very 2 weeks, no excuses.
---
guess what. i already quitted 2 weeks ago when they released their great stepping stone for raids.
---
and i honestly love the game. i like the graphics, the story is okay, the combat feels so smooth (want something to compare? try ffxiv. feels like its 2009 again), but the direction anet is currently going just feels like a slap into zhe face for someone who is here since the beta weekends
---
Indefinitely
---
Yes please! Omg, now I have to go pick a char and find some screens. Is there a race that you prefer to draw? Also, would you prefer real money or Gold?
---
Finally this is coming. It's more or less what i was expecting but a few things could be done better:
---
Build Templates
---
I find a good idea that any character can have 3 or more preloaded builds to be able to change "on the fly". However, the account templates (that 3+3 thing) seems to be done this way to be able to monetize it. Lets be honest, there's no secret in build templates, They could have copied the GW1 system where you just get a txt file with the chat link stored on your machine and you could have infinite build templates if you wanted.
---
Equipment Templates
---
Here's the real challenge for anet. I like the idea of items that are part of a equipment template not taking space in inventory but just having a default of 2 is definitely low. If you play both PVE and WvW you already have both slots occupied and in both game modes you could have 3-4 usual builds to use. But in this case i'm completely fine with anet monetizing the extra slots. Let us purchase at least up to 5-6 slots, and please, this purchase should affect in an account bound manner, not per character.
---
Next step in equipment templates department: The first step we are getting is good, but we cannot stop here. We need some kind of account shared equipment bag so we can share certain equipment items (trinkets is the best example). I realize that this feature could force anet to redo the equipment template system but it's necessary. They can even monetize the number of slots of this equipment bag just like they do with shared inventory bags. Those slots would only accept account bound equipment items and placing one item there would have the treatment as being part of the equipment template of any character in your account. Removing an item from that special bag would also remove it form any template form your account that uses it.
---
Should I download it again from scratch? Cause I've had the game files on unchanged since a couple years now. Maybe all the updates stacked or something and there's lots of unused data that would not be downloaded again if I did a fresh install
---
I assume that all the portal non-sense is just to reset the timer on getting kicked out of the area?
---
&gt;guess what. i already quitted 2 weeks ago when they released their great stepping stone for raids.
---
Well ok then, problems solved all around!
---
&gt;and i honestly love the game. i like the graphics, the story is okay, the combat feels so smooth (want something to compare? try ffxiv. feels like its 2009 again), but the direction anet is currently going just feels like a slap into zhe face for someone who is here since the beta weekends
---
I don't know, I've been here since the beta weekends, and the only time I've felt they really slapped me in the face was when they added raids, but I stuck around anyway, and it's still been mostly fine.
---
3-400 gems per equip slots is way too much, dude. Thats 5 € 😅
---
**My agreement** is that if they piss me off I'll just go play Destiny 2, I'm not going to loose my workflow coz they want me to buy templates slot or whatever.
---
I like the game as it is: you want give ,e something more? Fine.
---
You take away a thing I've been using extensively every day on every alt for many years? Oh boy I'm gonna get loud and hungry.
---
&gt; when they added raids,
---
ah.. i understand.. you are one of that guys 🙄
---
Bro I love you man.
---
I fucking dare them to answer this on stream. Never gonna happen though. Pussnet doesn't like criticism.
---
So, a bag slot per character is 400 gems.
---
I'd assume build and gear template slots per character to be monetized similarly - after all, "wE aRE paYiNg fOr geAr sTorAgE". However, a new character slot is 800 gems.
---
If an equipment slot would be 400 gems, it'd be easier for many vets to actually buy a new character, because it already has more free build templates as well, than to purchase the amount of slots needed to continue playing their builds. Which kinda defeats the convenience of not needing to swap or load characters.
---
So honestly, I am hoping for gear and build slots to be 200 gems each max, so 600 gems for the 3x package we'll get in the store.
---
As for build storage slots - not sure. It might be somewhat close to that of shared inventory slots, but that would massively overstate the value of these things, especially because you can store your build links in external files.
---
Could be anywhere between 200 and 800 per slot for all I can imagine.
---
I sincerely hope they find acceptable price points.
---
Also, I feel like owning legendary armour should award at least one free build slot per sompleted owned set. Crafting egendary armour is not rewarded or accommodate din the slightest by this system.
---
As long as it is legendary gear, it should be part of build template, not gear template. That way the legendary gear will take up one slot and can be utilized fully for free switching. But once you include non-legendary changes or sigils or whatever, that needs additional gear slots...
---
I would love if it would be this way, but that's probably too complicated to be true.
---
I'm not denying that it is way cheaper but currently you can get legendary armour in PvP and WvW as well and not only in Raids.
---
For the long term legendary gear will the way to go even if it is something expensive. It is just another goal and you don't have to worry about having the right equipment anymore or have to go through the steps to make it right.
---
In my case, I got full legendary armour through PvP and WvW. It took some time but you will get it eventually. And then it replaces your existing armour completely. Currently, since I don't use ArcTemplates, I switched between my Ascended WvW set and the legendary Set just because I was too lazy to select the stats on my legendary gear every time I switched the game modes (or I forgot), with the Build templates I can retire the WvW set completely, I can extract the runes and use them for the legendary gear.
---
So, build templates will make switching gear easier but the restrictions to ascended gear and the convenience of legendary gear will still be available.
---
smol indie company
---
Yeah and you get 2 for free, instead of the 20+ I have right at this moment with arc.
---
&gt; What exactly am I going to fund by buying BT slots?
---
The next release of super challenging strike mission.
---
I really liked GW1's approach where I could basically use one single armour with the addition of a few weapons and and then completely change the way I play the game by switching out my skills and rearranging my attributes.
---
GW2, on the other hand, not only ties the skills to weapons (which is similar to how GW1 did it, with the difference that a "wrong" kind of weapon in GW1 made you less effective (outside of very specific skills), whereas in GW2 you get completely locked out of certain skills), it also splits between condi and power and has tons more of armour pieces to gather, with the BiS gear also being much more difficult to obtain (because grind = achievement). Which means that I have been basically playing a single build for the last years.
---
So, templates really do nothing for me. But it also means that I have been playing pretty much the exact same fucking build for the last 7 years and why I am kind of bored of the whole thing.
---
What I want to say is that ... I want to blow the hairy-chested guy.
---
This is just gaming now. If people had any conviction whatsoever they would flat out refuse to pay for a feature like this, but whatever, they won't.
---
I think it's pretty bad. I still play through the LW and browse this sub, but sometimes I just log in, do a few events, look at my inventory and.. eh, screw this, I'm going to play a game with decent inventory management.
---
It is ok for me judging by the fact that for the few classes i have more than two builds playing i can use the shared slots. I think they chose the limit well that most will not need extra but the few that will will buy them. I would be happier with more free ones but not a big deal as it is.
---
&gt; Otherwise it takes three times the clicks and alot more time, thanks to scrolling the stats, to switch stats.
---
they implemented a search function for stats and upgrades a while back, so scrolling isnt neccessary anymore.
---
That‘s exactly the problem. As guardian main I also have like 7- 8 builds right now, for raids and fractals only.
---
Imagine only having 3 per character now. That‘ll ruin everything...
---
Changing traits and skills is not the main problem. But changing all the stats from legendary armor, weapons and trinkets, swapping runes and sigills, that‘s just super painful right now.
---
Isn't it nice that the arrival of build templates is actually a step back since now it costs money. Never change anet :)
---
It's own vocal minority for each (non)issue. Glorious.
---
You can't. 
---
Well, I mean you technically can stop it from downloading things I suppose, but that also means that you won't be able to login to an play the game.
---
Hello, installed it like you said and got a few questions:
---
a) When I look at my task manager, I see that 75% of my RAM is being used (6GB), but on my graphic card it only says 2%, is this normal?
---
b) How long does it take until the shaders are built and the game renders everything smoothly on mapload? Is there any way to preload everything, for example while I'm at work?
---
God... what a sad state of affairs
---
The virtual folder that holds all game files is treated by file system as a single file and thus, these are prone to defragmentation tools operations (tho file fragmentation still occurs if I'm not mistaken); this issue doesn't apply at all to SSD drivers which are recommended for GW2 to run by community
---
Depending on your settings, game may download maps and content on the fly - IIRC the minimal playable game was about 7GB for English-only version last year. The current GW2 size is about 43 GB.
---
I'd rather not be fucked around as a customer from a company that had this as a previous limitless feature for free in the previous game and that should have shipped with the motherfucker upon release.
---
Even if you bought the skills unlock you still had to buy the normal skills in PvE and go capture the elite ones, they would only be truly unlocked for your heroes and in PvP.
---
I am fine with it but i can imagine that it is not enough for support players that also play DPS unless they have multiple characters of the same class.
---
&gt; loud and hungry
---
Eat something then.
---
Instead of selling them like their bag slots, that is, character bound rather than account bound, they should sell them like shared inventory slots. When you buy one, it should add an extra Template Slot for ALL characters, yet it should be character specific, so the changes made in one character's slot, does not change all the others as well if that makes sense. If they did that I would be more than happy to buy some and support them further.
---
Ah, fair point it was only unlocked in the competitive modes.
---
I don't think massive is the right word. But it is indeed time that they prefer investment in other parts of the game.
---
&gt;Alternatively, it is super easy to just boost up an alt of the same profession for two more slots.
---
The whole fucking point is so that we don't have to do this shit anymore lol
---
This is not a singleplayer game..you cant just stop updating and play on the old version. You can only play on the old version until the game kicks you and closes the game.
---
Thank you very much for your extra kind words :).
---
For me, the most satysfying outcome would look like this:
---
1. Build Template for Characters sold separately in packages of 3, with option to manually assign each of the new tabs on selected characers. 
---
2. Build Templates for Account to be scaled with number of character slots. Number can be adjusted, but it could be 2 Account Template tab for each character slot above baseline.
---
3. Gear Templates, like Character Build Templates, sold in packs if 3, to be distributed individually. 
---
As for the price, since Templates do not come with an option to share Equipment between characters without headache, and do not support legendary gear usefulness, it needs to be low or there will be little to no incentive to purchase it. 3 build tabs ans 2 gear tabs combined should cost less than character slot, since the latter comes with a plethora if other usefull things, like gathering parking, map completion, birthday gifts, aesthetics of race/class combo, etc
---
They did not reverse their approval, the approval was given on the notion that if they released their own version, his would no longer be supported.
---
&gt; I just hope to be able to play for as long it takes for them to realize that taking away things and killing the user workflow is bad for business.
---
Anet makes nothing on Arc, meanwhile a single USD earned on their new templates is good for business.
---
so what is it? are you just gonna go play Destiny 2 instead or are you gonna get loud and hungry?
---
I'm glad i left the game
---
The rightside may also be a result of templates. I usually run one stat/build in PVE because its easier that way, allthough i have the equipment available to statswap.
---
&gt; the community reaction
---
You mean, the loud reaction of a handful of raiders on some social media site who've not ever been the main target audience?
---
On the contrary. This is when it's really going to start to shine (assuming you are one of not using arcdps build templates). Equipment templates would allow you to use your unique legendary equipment piece with a different setup on each slot without having to change stats anymore.
---
The only unsolved problem is that equipment builds are per character not per account, so a legendary item that could be potentially used by any character on your account will still be attached to one character. That means you would still need to craft 3 of each legendary armor weight sets instead of only 1 want to cover all your classes.
---
As nicebrood said, it's not f2p its b2p (buy to play) . There's a small difference, but it's there.
---
Let‘s see what the price is. If it‘s like +5 extra slots for each character for like 800 - 1000 gems, it‘s totally fine.
---
But I‘ll definetely not pay **hundreds of euros** just to play the game the way I did before, using multiple builds on multiple characters. That would honestly ruin the game for me personally, since raids are the only content I‘m playing regularly.
---
I've used them to block projectiles and things for my team in fractals like on Old Tom - you can literally wait out the projectile spin by standing behind a clone.
---
Being able to buy competitive advantage is literally a definition of P2W.
---
I was hoping that it could be like not having an expansion: you just loose the can't use the most recent content.
---
You can never play in instances together with players who updated game. If you want to play solo, then try tinkering.
---
Also, I believe that all instances of old patch are being shutdown when game force you to restart after some time in game when patch is being released. This probably prevents anyone from logging without update.
---
Thanks for all the fish :)
---
No, /u/good_live is right... It depends on how much you min max. As a support Chrono you can very easily run giver's or minstrel's everywhere and be fine, just like as a DPS you can have one set of berserker gear and be fine, but if you want to actually min max you're looking at multiple different builds.
---
Dragonhunter builds, for example, vary depending on whether you have Spotter or not, whether you're taking the Right-Hand Strength trait, whether you're taking Perfect Inscriptions, whether you're in a raid or fractal, etc. Power Chrono builds vary whether you're on Illusions or Domination traits, whether or not you take Danger Time, whether or not you have Spotter, and whether or not you're in a fractal.
---
I personally have perfectly crit-capped or condi-duration-capped power and condi builds that shuffle the exact number of trinkets, legendary stat swaps, and infusions to hit the right stats. Similarly, I have support builds that are perfectly capped on boon duration depending on which content I'm playing them in. It's absolutely unfeasible to remember all of those minute changes in my builds without templates, regardless of whether I'm on support or DPS.
---
No. Nor will I be surprised when the player base actively and vigorously defends this pure bullshit.
---
If you think the game will die because of this you are truly delusional.
---
From a company standpoint they need and should monetize this kind of feature, it's a business not a charity.
---
If you don't have an expansion, then your account simply has a flag that prevents you from accessing expansion content.
---
You still have all game files on your PC, and all game files need to be of the current game version to be able to connect to the game servers.
---
I dont want to sound offensive, but it is very clear, that you have no clue what you are talking about. getting different gear in gw2 (complete set costs like 15gold) which is almost nothing, (you dont need ascended gear, exotic is all fine) and the trinkets cost nothing, because they are very easy to obtain with living story mats.
---
And for the Gw1 part you are also completely wrong, because it is almost the same as with gw2, you need different armor for different builds, because of the armor upgrades do affect your build in a massive way. for example I have 6 different armors on my ranger and around 10 different weapons, and  4 different armors for my necromancer and 6 different weapon sets.  When I gw2 I only have 2 to 3 armors per class and around 10 weapons each class
---
This is something players have wanted for a while in-game, they've just made one of the expansions free and the build templates *are* free for a the first few. I don't see a problem with selling extras ones. 
---
This game costs them money to run. We've already had one round of redundancies this year, so monetizing aspects of the game will help it longer-term. 
---
Don't forget that gems can be got for free in game a couple of ways.
---
Dam that's to bad, so I'm fuuuuked :(
---
"bohoo this free Update isnt 100% fitting my Playstyle cause im the minority and have all the legendary Gear" - Jesus Christ i hate donkeys Like you
---
A favourite Stats function is what we would have needed. Not that thing.
---
Dam I was hoping I could prevent unwanted upgrade like you do with Windows.
---
Game automatically repack it's .dat file (that contains whole game) and checks crc. There is no way for any leftover stuff unless devs left them there, so everyone have the same .dat
---
Hyperbole.
---
Exactly, they make a lot of money selling skins and income seams stable. 
---
Hence more reason not to milk the playerbase for tiny bits. 
---
So eather they value their profits more than their customers or they are on the brink of shutting down their servers because they can't pay there bills and milking the playerbase is easier than to improve the game/add content. Not happy with either.
---
It's a fucking copy paste tool for the code that gets generated from skill and trait combinations.
---
You can probably store the build chat codes on a phantom guild description. Represent, pick your build, done, that seems a valid workaround
---
Buuuuu, that's to bad
---
And another infusion that i don't like. Personally i only like infusions that add effects (subtle or more notoriuos) to your character, but not those that completely alter the color scheme base of your skin.
---
My favorite infusion is still the Liquid Aurillium one, it has a light/subtle effect but you can increase the effect adding more infusions.
---
&gt;	I’d rather pay for expansions than have to pay for QoL features that should have been in the game at launch.
---
I’d rather pay for expansions than have to pay for QoL features that should have been in the game in 2012 and were added in to the previous game in the series in 2007.
---
I feel like numbers make it seem even more crazy
---
You cant play for month, only a couple of hours, depending on what your are doing.
---
Thank you!
---
All those nerfs and it is still the best dps in WvW.
---
Yeah of curse you are right, this is going to teach me not to invest much in a _game as a service model_, something that as I can see can unilaterally kick me out if I don't agree to a new policy.
---
The sad thing, for me at least, is that I don't have any problem with the game as it is now, I was looking forward to buy new expansion / content / whatever and be part of the community.
---
If only they could have delayed this template thing longer...
---
And I’m fine with that. They are giving everyone not decked out in full legendary more bag space.  Yes I could wish for 1 more slot per character but it’s reasonable as it is.
---
Okay buddy
---
Yea me as well, its pathetic that they give us 3 templates per characters, is that really fucking it. Even the most basic features that should have been in the game day 1 are being used as gemstore bait. Both pathetic and disguisting.
---
Good rule of thumb is to just ignore everything before that but.
---
It already is.
---
They have only solved half of the problem with the equipment template.
---
Until now (unless you were using arcdps addon) the capability of legendary equipment to switch for free was very unpractical because it was a nightmare to keep changing stats/runes/sigils/infusions on each of 10 to 20 items every time you wanted to switch a build. It was just easier to have an ascended piece dedicated for each build and just double click it each time. Now that is solved.
---
The unsolved part is that equipment templates only work per character, so if you place your legendary armor in your guardian you would still need to get 2 extra sets for your warrior and Revenant for optimal performance. And similar situation with other armor weights, weapons and trinckets.
---
Can we at least agree that people are bitching pre-emptively?
---
Scrolling by and had to do a double take as I thought it was Overwatch icons
---
It was NEVER intended as an be all solution for you.
---
I don't understand you people. You get one finger for free, you want two hands FFS.
---
You got a little QoL stuff, don't friggen look in the gifted horses mouth.
---
It is better than what we had before. END OF.
---
i doubt that wow was the first to showcase a cartoony character breathing fire after eating something spicy
---
&gt; It's a pain but Anet has to earn money from somewhere and right now its build templates.
---
Just make a 15euro expansion that goes by _Your old 150 templates will still work_ with included sad panda pet and I'm good with it :)
---
&gt;A Template for Jumping Puzzles"
---
Fall damage trait, probably. Different weapons for leaps and swiftness and whatnot.
---
&gt;3 gear sets for every of 9 Professions for different builds.
---
At some point you're gonna have to realize you're not a common case, you're part of the minority that wants to min-max every little breathing aspect of random alts you probably barely play. So yes, there's no reason why they should cater this to people with 20 different builds.
---
this is an MMORPG and not a single player game.
---
They have to pay money to keep the game running and fund future development. Personally, throwing the whole game into the gutter just because you are inconvenienced by one thing is very silly.
---
Lots of cogs in the system interacting. You can just freeze your version of the game. Imagine if you could stop an exploit being fixed. This post is just mental
---
What? I have three
---
I would get the [converters](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Converter) if you can. [Princess](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Princess) is pretty easy if you follow a [guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Lion%27s_Arch_Exterminator). [Herta](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Herta) is another easy collection with a [guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/A_Study_in_Gold). [Mawdrey](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mawdrey_II) [requires a lot of bloodstone dust](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/calculator/a~0!b~1!c~0!d~1-66999), a collection with a bunch of steps, a lot of daily crafts and season 2. It takes a long time but also gives an ascended back piece. [Star of Gratitude](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Star_of_Gratitude) is only during winter's day coming up. [Gleam of Sentience](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gleam_of_Sentience) is made out of a couple other collection rewards from season 3, more that you'll want to follow a guide for as a couple are pretty long. Also unlocks the start of the legendary trinket collection [Aurora](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Aurora).
---
There are several items and one time uses for the ascended materials but as it is now you have more than enough of the refined ones, I'd stop making any more and look to use the ones you already have. Some can be used for ascended crafting, or guild hall upgrades, or collections (like the new 500 chef).
---
TBH you can toss a bunch of it since it isn't worth a lot and is easy to get. I personally hate "wasting" it so I try to covert as much as I can or use it.
---
this character had some other visual effects on its equipment so i thought its better to unequip everything. wearing a helmet also reduces the visibility of the flame aura.
---
Forced is a perfectly correct word, but this force was applied in universe. 
---
They are pretty much defeated and a truce with a peace settlement was the best peace deal they could ever hope to get. Unlike with an unconditional surrender, Flame Legion continues to have some autonomy and continued existence. Granted, they paid a hefty price for that, but Efram is the right charr for this job. He can smooth over the differences with the other legions and in time have it become a well respected legion of the Charr.
---
It has seen better days, fully agree on that. But it's not this that will kill it, if anything it will pump numbers up slightly.
---
We've been hearing the "omg it's gonna kill the game and I'm out!" every announcement, and yet the very same people saying this or a good bunch of them end up staying. If you are so bothered by the game state stop playing it. It's that simple
---
&gt; Equipment templates would allow you to use your unique legendary equipment piece with a different setup on each slot without having to change stats anymore.
---
But how is that any different from just having 2 sets of ascended armor in your 2 build templates?  2 sets of ascended is way cheaper than 1 set of legendary.  1 set of legendary use to at least save you some inventory space.  Now it wont
---
Not a question but a request. With the introduction of Templates, can we finally separate the visuals from the gear? Can I have a certain look on my character not tied to gear itself, but to gear template tab?
---
Being able to click one button to deposit all crafting materials into its own bank, while also being able to compact your inventory with one button isn't decent inventory management?  I must be behind the times, because I thought GW2 had great inventory management.
---
Here's news for you. You don't get 3 equipments templates, you get 2.
---
But the creator of the tool has said this all along. You have had plenty of time to come to terms with what's happeninf
---
Awesome work, let me know your price and I'll certainly buy one too!
---
its not like the flame animation looks any different during the day. Its not equipment that reflects ambient light.
---
I don't ask for free, I';m good to pay for content or added features I can enjoy.
---
When something I use extensively on a daily base for all my alts is going to be taken away from me so that I'm forced to buy gems and waste time to recreate ~150 template / builds for all my alts: I'm not happy!
---
So do I have just to STFU and eat shhhhht and not even try to avoid it?
---
What? We already have two hands, now they cut off 9 fingers so we have 1 left, and sell the other 9 in the gem store.
---
Hang on it's not so easy for us! I also have a single piece of assassins armour I have to swap out for my BS. It's a very time consuming operation.
---
that doesnt work with gear tho
---
Paying per character? 
---
Ye no thanks.
---
Would way rather just store it on my computer.  If my computer dies, so does my access to gw2, so its a pretty moot point.
---
Recently made this for a friend to show my characters, I'm proud of the screenshots so wanted to share ^^
---
I love how expansive the character creation and customization is in GW2.
---
Yeah you are right, I see that.
---
They can just kick me off at any moment and I will lose all my play time, I guess I should just avoid to invest much time / effort in just one game in the future.
---
As someone who runs all the builds of guardian and mesmer in pve, this makes me hope someone picks up arc dps templates when they drop it
---
This mechanic already exists with Elementalist's Arcane Power and it has never seen use (for it's party ferocity buff effect).
---
Also arcdps templates won't receive QoL upgrades as development stopped as soon as Anet announced they were making theirs.
---
Yeah, pay tens of euros for it~ open end~~ i want a complete product. At a reasonable price,  no open end shit
---
Right side is me playing a class that uses Zerker for both dps and support builds
---
You realize the people 'complaining' about buying templates aren't the same people who said they'd pay for them?
---
It's the same with people who complain about a class being too strong then after patch people complain about the nerf. They are not the same group of people. It's not a difficult concept to understand.
---
Yep, got a similar one on my DD Main too.
---
It's too bad the loot system sucks and feels u rewarding.
---
Do that jp? 2 silver and trash.
---
Kill those fractal bosses. 5 silver and a chance at up to 2-3 gold. Oh and some trash.
---
Farm a map for a skin  every day because it's not attainable by non rng methods? May not see it for years... Oh and some trash.
---
It's really my only complaint anymore. Feels unrewarding to play.
---
200 gems sounds like a good price
---
let me see.... windows is a local copy you run on your own PC and nothing more. You dont even connect to ms servers unless you pull new daily wallpaper/updates/ telemetry bullshits.
---
Gw2 on the other hand is a MMO where hundrets of players connect to a single server using hundrets of individual clients not patched all at the same version. So player 1 bubble will still affect 10 targets, cuz he is running 5 patches ago client, player 2 thief steal will still have 1200 range, cuz he is running 3 patches client ago, player 3 will have nerco OP as fuck, cuz he havent patched his game since 1 year to keep running his OP necro, player 4 wont have raids at all, cuz he havent patched raid patch, player 5 wont have masteries cuz he havent patched since start of HOT........  yeah, sounds very fun and likely for anet to do something like that.
---
There are very different things 
---
* Storage slots : those are gw1-like builds that can be manually loaded to your characters when you need them. They are the key to build diversity. They are the main thing I always wanted from build templates. And most importantly, they can be emulated with a text file do you can copy-paste instead of paying. IMHO, those should be cheap in big packs. Like packs of 20, 50 and 100 for 800 2k and 4k gems or something like that.
---
* Build template slots : those are pure convenience to have several builds loaded at once so you can just press 1 key to instantly swap ooc. With ability to run around with 3 builds that you can hotswap depending on the looks of monsters or wvw enemies, that's quite good. I don't mind them costing more. However, the price I'm willing to pay really depends on how they're delivered : is it only a per-character unlock like bag slots, or is there an option to unlock each slot account-wide to affect all existing and future characters ? If it's per-character, I'll be hesitant to buy them and only buy when I really need one ... I already paid for bag slots and gathering tools many times over the years as they're per-character, but now a new character-based unlock would be quite a paywall if I had to update my existing characters. I think it should be cheaper than bags slots. Maybe 200 gems per slot per character. However if there is an account-wide unlock option, then I don't mind paying a lot (even if mathematically the account-wide option costs more than total what I was willing to pay for character-based option ... Cause permanent acc-wide unlock is something I like) ... like thousands of gems.
---
* Equipment template slots : the reasoning is the same as above, except they also count for nice storage (not only it's 19 slots but also it's 0 mess contrarily to a bag). I think it's fair if they cost the same as a bag slot, 400 gems. But just as above, I'd be willing to pay a lot if there was an option to unlock each slot account-wide for all existing and future characters.
---
1. I could be ran to the Docks and get my BiS gear at level 3.
---
2. Running 40/40 gear or energy gear was decent, but simply running a basic staff (that didn't even need to be for your class) or vitae runes certainly didn't make the difference that can be seen by running berserker, soldier or vipers.
---
So fuck off.
---
It's a huge thing for me, if for whatever reason my add on does not work I just don't play the game because it's no fun for me if I'm not able to change my template on the fly with a full set of bags with something like 8 armor sets.
---
Very cool!!
---
Not allowed to criticize the game in the Cult of Gw2?
---
Current arc template is superior to anet's solution as it allows for near infinite amount of templates and it's free. 
---
So how is it better? Just because some of the gear is moved from inventory to the template? What good will it do if you're limited to 6 or whatever number it is and you still have to pay for them.
---
Builds are a second to swap traits and skills. That's not the biggest problem (although it's not nice to be limited there as well). It's equipment swapping on legendary gear that takes a ton of time with all the different gear/rune/infusion/weapon combinations. And those don't have codes as far as I can tell.
---
How to completely miss the point 101.
---
Agreed.
---
I don't wanna re do all my actuals ~150 templates.
---
What if you made one character the owner of the template, then other char could borrow (use) it, but not change it, since only the owner is allowed to do that?
---
Ohhh yeahh B)
---
People were honestly thinking this would not be on the gemstore lmao.
---
What do you mean? The heart part? That easy part made you quit?
---
And are also limited to two, not three by default :(
---
yea most of the carebear casual playerbase can't even handle the word "raid" or they lose their shit, pathetic twerps.
---
What about skins templates?
---
If I didn't miss anything it's not planned for the moment to have skins presets?
---
Ye but I've already spent a lot of gold in the last 6 years to max up inventory slots and bag in order to carry around my ~6 sets for many alts, now I have to pay again and re-do 100 templates and I have no need for it.
---
And I play all of them. My only hope that build templates will be sold as additional crafting licenses, not as bag expanders, I.e. plus one free slot for all characters, not just for one of them.
---
But I really doubt so.
---
It means that the kernel of legitimate concern gets drowned out by inflationary bitching and whining 24/7 about literally everything ever, and the rest gets taken over by exaggerations so ridiculous it kills every attempt at an actual discourse until everything is made up and nothing matters anymore.
---
Nuance and objectivity have never been characteristics of a public discourse, it's not different on the internet.
---
In my opinion, the changes in gear that are done within legendary, should be part of build template and not gear template. That way you actually are encouraged to get legendary gear as it takes only single gear slot, while you can have a lot of build templates.
---
At least we don't have subscription. So if your cheap ass can't afford templates this month, you can at least play the game until you save that 5 euros to purchase them later. With Wow you just can't play the game if you miss on paying your subscription. You can't expect a company this big to live of bread crumbs
---
Just leave the old system in place for those who don't want a new trick.
---
This is only a dilemma in your head.
---
Is having 2 build templates better than no templates? yes
---
Is ArenaNet monetizing a feature that should have been present in the game's release and already existed in guild wars 1 and practically every other mmo in the market with no limits, absolutely pathetic? yes.
---
&gt;exotic
---
implying people don't still have blues and greens, and I'm not talking about underwater gear.
---
That could simply be an edge case. Limiting certain templates to only be available to certain races. Much the same way armor classes limit equipability.
---
Wahhhhhhhhhhh
---
&gt;Anet release templates, practically gifting you plenty bag slots that gets freed from the inventory and would have to be bought otherwise 
---
&gt;hur durr, greedy Anet wants me to buy more tenplate slots, I want them for free :v
---
Just saying... They gifted you practically 18 free slots per equipment template for free, which would mean one extra bag slot per set, yep people comes here nagging about having to pay *cough* gold conversion *cough * to have some extra templates.
---
And yet reading the notes on it the templates will be a small QoL improvement over a note pad chat code, yet we are having a giant uproar over being "forced" to pay. I'm in the same boat as OP with multiple builds and gear sets for my main. I'm buying the equipment slots and going to use chat codes on build templates because that's an obvious work around.
---
or you could just buy gems with gold
---

---
Complaints about not having build templates ended ages ago. People either moved on and accepted ArcDPS as the solution (me included), or accepted the lack of them or deal with it with a different way - my guild leader has 3 warriors, each with its own set.
---
It's time to stop. Just get a job and you will be able to afford playing a God damn game. Yall been living at your mom's for far too long
---
MMOs are fucking dead.  Honestly.  Fucking whiny people are so god damned spoiled and they still find something to bitch about.
---
I would be shocked at anything at or above 400. One Character Slot Expansion is 800. Two extra template slots being equal in cost to a character? No way. Having the extra character has additional benefits.
---
I have like 6 characters with mostly 1-2 builds each, maybe 3 on one, I just don't bother with min-maxing variants when playing instanced content. I wasn't using arcdps templates so this is gonna be a nice QOL change for me and I'll even happily buy some more slots probably.
---
Not doing events? Flame is out there making themselves useful, working with others and are busy recovering from their recent loss. In exchange for magic support for the other legions he has bought enough time to recover to a position of strength. Their diplomacy is not identical to 250 years ago, which is hardly surprising. Not to mention that Bangar's, or rather Crecia's, interests of Charr reconciliation aligned with the interests of Efram's faction.
---
As for Efram himself, do you think he can be nice and weak at the same time and survive in Flame Legion? His demeanour might be that of a gradfatherly charr sage, but if you challenge him to a magic battle, I suspect you'll burn in his lava font. A good number of wannabe tribunes probably made the mistake to assume Efram is an easy promotion.
---
Hod the f do you get an exotic breather anyways? They don't sell it on TP.
---
Cool, hope you enjoy it.
---
Just leave the old system alive and updatable coz I have spent tons of gold buying inventory slots and perfecting 150 templates.
---
The game that came before GW2 for one.
---
that's not how it works lol. it's the most likely and logical conclusion, without any evidence to the contrary (when all the available info supports it) it stands as the only conclusion. you're arguing semantics because you really don't have any information to support your claim and you don't like my conclusion, that doesn't make it wrong.
---
The GW2 playerbase, yes.
---
You need a time machine back to ~2005 then, before this all took off.
---
I still open my unid gear because of the chance of getting higher tier loot. While the results aren't amazing, since they added "consume all" we're talking a couple of extra clicks.
---
Overall though, I just prefer not having to dick around with salvage kits. I have the copper fed in one shared inv slot, and a stack of mystic salvage kits in another.
---
The problem is more: why are some classes allowed to do everything, while others aren't?
---
Like rev, or guard?
---
Both can be healers, buffers, dps.
---
IMO that depends on the situation. you might be able to reuse a gear set or mix two sets but basically have the same build or vice versa. Or why should one have to buy equipment slots if you have legendary gear?!
---
I'm starting to wonder how (if) "most people" in this game are able to find toilet in their house tbh.
---
The blog specifically says your legendary equipment can be tied to different builds with different stats, runes, etc. So you don't lose any QoL. You just move the same item to different slots and put there different stats. At least that's how I understood it.
---
Itd be nice if they moved transmog off of gear to the slots the gear are in
---
&gt; Third, they can do whatever they want.
---
What about they just add instead ov remove?
---
But right now you have a better tool than the one they will implement with arcdps.
---
no different at all, it's just effectively making use of the legendary free change status without the need to aquire any new piece of equipment. If you already have all your ascended pieces there's no difference at at all. Well, legendary still has access to any future stat that is added in the future so you won't have to grind for it if you have it.
---
Lets just say that the free changes features of legendary equipment was broken until now because it was easier to get different ascended pieces with the correct stup than having to piece by piece chaging each thing every time. For sure at this time you alreadu have all your ascended equipment variations, but if you have legendaries you won't need to get anymore ever again (except to unlock skins of course).
---
&gt; The system has been running for 6 years with the old template system, just acknowledge that and let it go on.
---
The ArcDPS Build Template integration was release [2 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/704oem/build_templates_actual_release/)
---
And there was no template system in GW2 and many things have changed since release that probably made it possible to have build templates in a better form than before.
---
What does the necro "do" the strongest?
---
&gt; they've just made one of the expansions free
---
Lmao I already paid for that years ago.
---
Comparing the not so average casual to the average raider doesnt work.
---
Was there something confusing about this paragraph or did you just not bother to read it?
---
*Build Templates can also be copied as a chat link in the game. You can send them to friends to help them prepare for a raid—or to your enemies to boast of your superior build. These chat links can also be copied and pasted out of the game and back into it from your clipboard, making trying a new build from another player or an external website a breeze.*
---
It's not coz I won't buy anything new if that's how the game rolls, and neither should you.
---
You can't stop anyone from spending their money. And since you are currently not bringing money to anet while using arc, they lose nothing by monetizing their own templates.
---
&gt; you might understand the context of my statement.
---
You might also understand the context of the whole frigging game, but you - along those like you - don't want to.

**This is not a game with a lot of content for people with a lot of money. This is a game with moderate content for people with little money.**
---
No matter how much you people complain about it, it won't change. *The MMO market needs a niche non-P2W game for casual players with low price tags for average content,* that can get compensated by overpriced cosmetics and QoL, and GW2 is exactly this. The fact that you found some parts of the game good enough to join anyway doesn't mean the whole game should be tailored for your needs.
---
It's literally the same as if I liked some anime targeted at kids because it was cute and wholesome, but then went to complain about how it's not smart and witty and dark enough for my grown-up tastes. If you're in the periphery demographic of a product, your first world problems are your problems - not the seller's.
---
That's, honestly, why "raids were a mistake" in the first place.
---
We'll probably see more on the livestream today, but isn't it so that you can use one piece of legendary gear on every equipment template ? The template then saves rune and stat settings, but you only use one item for it. That's how I understood it and that would mean even legendary items would need more equipment template slots to cover multiple builds.
---
It's in the video description
---
Yes, you are correct. But you might as well do the exact same thing with ascended gear which is cheaper and easier to obtain, and get the same results. Legendary gear's main QoL feature was the inventory space saving, which now is effectively disappearing as gear is stored separately from your inventory.
---
People who doesn't use build template plugins mostly doesn't need the official one. So no
---
&gt; Equipment Templates can also record the customization of legendary items, which can freely change attributes and upgrades. **You can equip a single legendary item to multiple Equipment Templates with different attributes and upgrade choices for each.**

I have bought and paid for everything available for this game for 6 years!
---
They did not have a template system for 6 years, we used arc, now they are taking that away forcing me to redo all by scratch? Just acknowledge that the arc system _has gone on forever_ and let it survive.
---
We currently have arc dps allowing for switching between however many gear sets and combinations we want for free. They are going to stop you using this add on with their replacement which isn't as good functionally and requires payment. If I want more inventory space I can buy that right now. I don't need a free bag. I want the ability to switch between builds that require different gear sets. At least 1 per specialisation as a start,( core +2 expac.) I know as a mes I have minstrel chrono tank, diviner tank, axe mirage, scepter mirage, power chrono, fractal diviner chrono. This is the reason people say it's not good enough. If i replaced a free system with one that requires money to be anywhere near as good you wouldn't be happy either.
---
GW2Taco has a notepad feature, no?
---
The only acceptable price is $0 for build templates, end of story. Build templates should have existed in this game *at fucking launch*. They have been asked for *since fucking launch*. And if the only way they could have possibly made them (because devewopment is so hawd you guysssss, devewopers cost so much money, this game is fwee to pway!!!) was to monetise the scheme, then at this point I'd have rather this game charged me a sub fee.
---
I'm sick of ArenaNet nickel and diming their player base - notably their veteran player base more frequently than not - and I'm equally tired of hearing all the dick-sucking ANet shills run around desperately trying to pretend that this game is somehow free to play and those poor little developers have families to feed. It isn't my job, or the job of any player, to pay a multi-million dollar company's employees, and it has never been our job - and this notion that somehow it is our responsibility is fucking ludicrous. I'm tired of this company having poor release cadence, taking multiple years to develop simple QoL features, and then trying to hide their nickel and diming behind the excuse that "well the Living World seasons are free! All this content is free! Look at how *free* it all is!" because not only is not free by technicality (because in order to play these Living World seasons, you *had* to have paid for Path of Fire) but the reality is that if a sub fee would have guaranteed this game had quality expansions, decent release cadence for things like raids or fractals, and genuine QoL updates that have been needed for years that also *didn't* involve actual daylight robbery, I'm willing to bet a decent number of people would have been pretty happy with a sub fee.
---
The amount of people who ask that question is fucking dumb. "WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE PAID A SUB FEE FOR THIS?!?!?" they screech. The answer is yes. Yes, I would have done. All of these people seem to think ArenaNet is dirt fucking poor and can't afford to pay their employees unless they grossly monetise the game in the way they have, and if that's *true* then maybe they deserve to go out of business. But beyond that, if that is actually true, maybe having a sub fee in place and developing *real expansions* would be the better route, then constantly trying to toot the "free content" horn all the goddamn time only to increasingly monetise every little thing they can monetise.
---
short version: you won't be able to.
---
long version: i'm really sorry, when the update with the new build goes live chances are that arcdps will stop working like what happens many times when there's an update. But when you get to install arcdps again the it's build template system will be deactivated/removed because that was the explicit condition it was given to the developer to make his 3rd party addon TOS compliant (condition = you have to remove it when the game offers that function in a way or another).
---
Food, shelter and safety is covered.
---
There will always be complaining.
---
Pls stay away with your Facebook wisdoms.
---
Wait, what? That's it? A liquid-y golden head?
---
i am of a similar opinion, but maybe not so strong.
---
i think of it as; weve waited like 7 years for this feature since most of us who played at launch expected build templates to be in the game from the start, just as we expected guild halls to be.
---
now FINALLY anet, after a long period of saying it will come "soon", gives us this long requested and long long overdue feature, just for us to find it will be pretty hampered unless you atleast shell out some money for it.
---
it just cheapens the whole thing. it just feels like just another money grab/cash cow that they throw on us on a much wanted feature that shouldve been completely free in the first place and that we've waited YEARS on.
---
theres still a lot of questions surrouding the equipment and build templates, things like how much will the upgrades cost, and will it be character wise or account wide. depending on that, it will either make or break it for me personally, opinionwise. 
---
if say equipment template slots are gonna be characterwise, and 800 gems? then yeah definitely it will feel just cheap...since 2 equipment slots per char is not nearly enough for what you need even on an average non-build concentric character.
---
Anet might also shoot themselves in the arm because most people have worked around the whole non-existence of character builds and equipment loadouts by having multiple characters instead and that has been working just fine for most people for years and years. pressing f12 and going to character select screen and picking say mesmer #2  with the setup for a specific gamemode like raids which takes like 10 seconds isnt too complicated and its definitely doable. then swapping back to mesmer #1 to continue playing open world.
---
so why would they suddenly feel the need to dish out yet even more gems to be able to have all those things on one character, leaving all those other characters now completely useless to minimize the hassle just by a fraction?
---
sounds to me like equipment templates in particular, might be something more aimed for people that are either very new and thus havent built up a lot of gear, or does not have a lot of character slots, or a combination of the two.
---
seems to have very little actual temptation for people who have played the game for a long time, and have build up multiple characters/char slots and gear. 
---
all coming back and depending on those initial questionmarks about accountwide/gem cost of course.
---
oh well, i guess we'll see where this will go.
---
In game where you can just turn your gold to the game's cash currency I don't really see an issue in the monetization of build templates
---
I got the impression (and I think it was explicitly stated, although I can't recall where) that the Flame Legion members we encounter are those who actively want peace, and there are still plenty out there who want a return to the old ways. Whether we'll see more of that split or not over S5 remains to be seen, but I wouldn't be surprised by it.
---
&gt;It is better than what we had before
---
It's better than not having an official solution in the game is what you're saying, right?
---
&gt;No one said it is better than some friggen plugin others developed
---
So because it was a 3rd party plugin you don't consider it as an available solution prior to this announcement?
---
&gt;Most people, don't use plugins you know
---
Care to share the statistics on the amount of players that use vs. don't use plugins? Because there are a lot of popular plugins out there and to name few: reshade, taco, radial mount wheel, arcdps (dps meter, templates), relatively recently introduced d912pxy etc.
---
You probably meant most people don't use arc templates and you'd probably be right. But why does this bother you or why would these opinions/complaints/suggestions bother those who don't use templates? You are getting more than what you had officially in the game with great features, but those who used unofficially supported templates are getting less for a price. 
---
I personally don't care there is a price attached to templates, so long as they are not overly expensive and there isn't a small cap. And that's most likely what others are concerned about and are raising their voice so that in the next month Anet can take in all the feedback, good and bad, and adjust the templates for smooth release.
---
I have 3 legendary armors for my mesmer(the only character I have).
---
I got a green level 50~ exotic lulw.
---
I was always wondering why there are pieces like breathers that straight up aren’t in the TP. I can get underwater weapons just fine, but not breathers for some reason
---
Agreed. If more updates were given for wvw/fractals/raids along with balance patches then there wouldn't be much room to complain about the transition from arcbuild templates to this new one.
---
What? Can I save my 3 legendary armors as ‘for everyone’ and they will equip them?
---
Just leave the old system alive and updatable.
---
I think you will be able to move the same ascended piece to different slots as well, **BUT** not with different stats, as swapping stats on ascended requires the mystic forge.
---
I feel stupid for crafting legendary armour sets now
---
nobody expected anet *not* to slap a price tag onto it. however anet apparently is going all out in that regard on a feature that frankly should have existed at launch and has been requested just as long, half-assedly forced it into the already existing UI that was already in dire need of a cleanup, slapped **3** different monetization methods onto it, and decided on a borderline useless amount of baseline-unlocked slots where it counts.
---
in fact for build template slots, the part that is literally just a tool to hold build codes, aka a glorified text file, they went with the absulute minimum number they could easily get away with, one for each mode.
---
now if e.g. there was a part of the gear templates that worked with a account wide storage solution, something particularly attractive for people with legendary gear, i'm rather sure virtually no one would have complained about the monetization of that.
---
mind you, we don't even know yet whether the purchases they do plan to offer for this will be account or character bound, and naturally they haven't talked about the price point yet... but frankly anet has managed to normalize mount skins as expensive as entire expansions, at this point i don't expect them to *not* abuse that fact.
---
Hi my necro wants to have a word. 3x wvw builds, power reaper, condi reaper, vipers raid, trailblazers pve, magi heal, marshals heal for the extra dps, 3 is not enough for something that used to be free
---
Everybody has a level 80 and plays level 80 content. There is no shortage of or demand for level 80 materials. For mid rarity materials, however, there is. And you make more money selling those.
---
A bag opener character remains at around level 50 and is tipically used to open Bags of Gear from farming silverwastes (RIBA/CF).
---
open them, salvage, sell.
---
You can only see 6 in the screenshots in the blogpost. It doesn't look like there's a slider or anything, but you're right, it's not confirmed for now. Just speculations.
---
hm lets think. you can have 10+ warrior berserker variants for fractals/dungeons/raids, but if berserker itself was shit you would have 0. hope that explains it to you
---
Arc build templates are being discontinued.
---
Because it's been free for more than a decade in gw1 and should have been in gw2 at launch, that's why. And you could have unlimited templates too.
---
No, Gear Templates are character bound and can´t be shared with a links. But you can create 3 different templates with the same legendary armor and just switch the stats on the templates
---
They never had to make a system like that. And sure, it's understandable you and others chose to invest in your own system, but that doesn't mean Anet owes you any support of that 3rd party system now.
---
You can copypaste from a Guild's MoTD, so you use, say, a bank guild to paste your builds into &amp; grab them from there.
---
Looks awesome!
---
Youre right and it might be the better way of handling them. But still, the widely accepted decision that copper fed is the best gemstore item came from a very different situation imho
---
I don't know what your perception of the average casual is, but I'm a "follow the zerg" player. I like swapping between condi necro and power reaper for open world stuff, and will have 2 more builds for my WvW zerging too, so 4 off the bat.
---
This is to say nothing of me wanting to try Minion Master, or dip into fractals here and there.
---
Maybe I'm less casual these days than I thought, but I definitely don't feel like I play on the hardcore side.
---
You'd have a point if this was the launch of the game but its not, we've already bought those bag slots.
---
It shouldn't be per character, if we wanna expand it should be account wise.
---
Oh my god i was just about to craft legendary armor!!!
---
Did i Dodge a bullet am i right? LOL
---
And we can call them out on that too. Eternal issue between legal right and moral right.
---
That's not gonna happen and you know it, it would kill any profit of the official version.
---
You can find exotic breathers in Orr, in the final map, at the west side in a pact camp!
---
&gt; Taking into account they HAD templates IN THE PREVIOUS GAME, it does reek of slacking.
---
They had multiclassing too. When are they adding that do you think?a
---
I've seen worse. It's hard to balance out rewards in a game, because if you just "give people better rewards," then that becomes the new expected baseline, and people start complaining again about "rewards not being good enough." 
---
I do wish that they have some sort of "collectable token" element that would allow you access to more RNG rewards in a non-RNG way, but the endgame of even that system is "having all the things," and then there's nothing else to chase. Nothing's quite perfect.
---
There is nothing immoral in selling their work.
---
Looks like I hit a nerve there lol
---
What I don't get is how people are that angry with Arenanet and rant left and right about the way they do things and still play GW2.
---
Kindly stop suckling your own dick.
---
NOBODY FORCES YOU to play this game, "you absolute bumbling moron."
---
The boundaries are what you set them to be.
---
They lose any purchase a leaving player would have made, outside of templates. Whether that is a big number or not is another story ...
---
Were you expecting never having to pay for the product?
---
All of the ones I listed are the rude ones...
---
Doesn't taco have a notepad option?
---
ahh I c your point, now you don't have to change the stats of the legendary.
---
that doesn't work either since the "new system" is not part of the game but a work around by a 3rd party.
---
And as Deltaconnect (the dev of the Arctemplates) said themselves 
---
&gt; One of the conditions to ANet allowing my templates extension was that I let it die when an official solution comes around, and that condition hasn't changed [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cz1rrb/build_templates_only_available_with_legendary/eywxzz9?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
there is really nothing else to say about this. It might or might not work when the patch hits but even if it still does it might not for long.
---
There is in basically hijacking a market. It's extremely similar to Apple destroying all low and medium price phones, and forcing people to buy theirs ... or nothing.
---
The choice won't exist anymore, it's buy or quit (because nobody using 15 templates will keep his sanity playing without them).
---
I bet they already calculated that with profits they will gain with templates. They are business, not reddit pleb - they know how to make money.
---
And I doubt most of the whiners will leave at all
---
Well if didn’t then there would be no reason to use it.
---
lol such entitlement
---
Tbh, I don’t understand why an account build template and not account gear template.
---
I can see the use of an armor set on other characters but why would I want to have my elementalist build on any other characters that my ele? Maybe if someone have many ele.
---
TaCo already have notepad feature IIRC.
---
The class that gets destroyed every patch the most is chrono, and what kinda chrono only has 1 build...
---
&gt; "Why charge money for builds?"
---
if you think that is rude then the problem is you
---
Yeah but I already have full legendary gear, so it's not actually saving many inventory slots.
---
Criticism bad! Bootlicking good! Everyone expected this to be gemstore related, but with in reason, i suppose most casuals don't see the people who REALLY need this have multiple alts with dozens of builds from all modes, so them having their level up gear is barely affected, but for us? This is nothing, it might as well never been release and i might as well stay with arcdps which we are losing too.
---
It makes totally sense to charge for the equipment template, since that is going to free up bag slots, but good golly, let us have free everything else just like how arcdps currently works. Let us load traits at will and load equipment from our own bags, this is the least they can do since thats what we had in gw1
---
I did the math  
---
If you play on all 9 classes. use 4-5 builds (condi power heal wvw openworld lets say)  
---
You will have to pay 32400 gems.. 
---
   
---
THATS 400 FUCKING EURO for something we had free with arc now.
---
Might be. I already did at the annoucement of Icebrood saga. I know many raiders (of course) whose guild disbanded and went to other games.
---
And this .... is the final nail in the coffin for me. I will still play this game, freely at each update. I won't pay for anything in the gemstore anymore, ever. Up til know, it was thousands of dollars.
---
They chose their market, and I'm (we're) not part of it. Oh well, there are plenty of games.
---
What market? They never had to allow you using Arc, but they did. For years. For free. You are on their yard, there is nothing to hijack. By accepting ToS you agreed they can do whatever they want, whenever they want with their game. Dont put morality into this. Dont play victim.
---
Those folks with 2 dozen builds were awfully silent every other day when somebody made a thread asking for templates and telling Anet to monetize it and "take their money".
---
You can complain that Anet doesn't listen carefully or communicate enough, but they can't read minds. Folks need to own up that in all the hubbub about build templates they said next to nothing about how they just liked Arc as it was and didn't want Anet to drop something in that they'd monetize.
---
I guess the solution is allow Arc to still exist, though I don't know if he'll still be bothered to support it for free either.
---
That is assuming that gear templates will store items. If it will just equip it from your inv legg armor will still save space
---
i bought 3000 gemms yesterday to max out on templates at day 1, but if 6 gear limit is true, it will still be worse for me than arc dps ones
---
They never considered raiders relevant community to begin with. Raids are not even properly monetized, thats how low they think of you.
---
How do you imagine them actually approaching answering a question like this on a stream? What do you envision an acceptable, or even unacceptable, answer to that sounding like?
---
We expected similar functionality and comfort. This is not what was expected, this is below the bare minimum acceptable.
---
i am quite sure he is
---
The message was very clearly received by everyone, don't worry !
---
&gt; Does Delta release a new update of Arc for *every* game update?
---
Pretty much. Some patches don't break it, and thus don't require an update. But those are the exception.
---
The fact that we don't know the price yet is worrying me. Bag slot expansion is 400 gems. Build templates have more value in my opinion, so 400 they'll be at least I am sure.
---
It looks similar togift of runes/sigil to me, maybe legendary infusions? who knows?
---
I'd love to have one of your sketches!
---
My favourite thing about your response is that when somebody points out to you how wrong you are about how "free" this game supposedly is, your only defence is "WOW GEE, GUESS I MADE YOU ANGRY, LOL. WHY DO YOU STILL PLAY?"
---
It's almost like you don't actually have a proper defence for this game after somebody tells you that it isn't free. It's *almost* like you don't understand what you're talking about when you claim this game is free, and when somebody calls you out on how *factually* incorrect you are, you're only able to say "Gee uh wow why you so angry" and try to play it off like "lol I hit a nerve" when the reality is you didn't hit a nerve, you're just kind of an idiot.
---
No templates for me then.
---
For what its worth, thats around 5€ per episode for a whopping 1-2€ a month.
---
you are right, but the reason is wrong.
---
Oh look, it's the same old 'just quit lol' post again.
---
And i have 25 alts each with 3~5 different builds, and mains having 10~12 builds for every single mode, what's your point?
---
Lol 20,- worth of gems barely gets you a single thing, this game doesn't have micro transactions, they're full on investments.. An expansion has way more bang for your buck.
---
Thank you for the advice, I probably will. Thats why I’m keeping it to 2 at a time, also. It might just come down to “first come first serve”
---
RNG monetization is bad i completely agree with that but anet made a clear attempt to make them customer friendly-er
---
I'd commission you right now
---
And remember, we care.
---
guess what, they would still lock the amount to something and allow more to be bought
---
Yea, maybe.
---
I only have one complaint:
---
* Not having build templates that work the way I want them to work.
---
the heat generated from furious circle-jerking
---
What is the build template storage slot? Is it going to act like shared inventory slot, so it only fits a single item? If so that is the dumbest thing ive ever seen them try to release. They should be Storage template TABS. The same size of bank tabs that can only fit things that go in a template. If they are actual slots and not tabs then they fucked up big time.
---
this is a really bad take
---
I agree that those with legendary armors get nothing from this aside from it being an official/supported way of quickly switching.  But that feels like a 1% problem.  Pardon my insensitivity to your plight here, but surely such accomplished players have multiple sets of ascended armors, multiple characters even. I'm pretty casual and I have a separate wvw firebrand and story guard.
---
I agree that this feature is slightly unfair to some people, but most would probably pick bag space over unlimited loadouts .  2 seems low though,  3 per character maybe the sweet spot.
---
Did you really think we'd get build templates without anything gemstore related?
---
Nice. While I have you here, do you do multi-character commissions?
---
Like, if I were to send you images of three of my characters (Mes/Necro/Ele) could you make a piece with all three of them in it together? Or do you specialize in single person pieces?
---
I was thinking maybe 250-300G for one like that.
---
I do remember those as exotic but it must been long time since I got those. Sorry for the bad info. I've been playing the game since beta and sometimes I do forget some details 😅
---
I'm alright with it because I want ANet to have a good revenue stream from GW2 that allows them to keep the game alive and allows them to maintain a more robust development team.
---
I have the opposite opinion: I don't care for stories or content and I'd gladly pay for QoL features. There's obviously a limit to this, it's not like they can release a game with absolutely no QoL features and them proceed to sell them all
---
And I don't like your view of this. It literally doesn't matter at all if it was free in GW1. By doing what they're doing, they're making the game more sustainable for a longer period of time. Would you rather receive free upgrades to the game that would make ANet abandon it earlier due to a lack of sustainable revenue stream?
---
I don't know the specifics like how many templates you can have per character for free, and I agree that the move seems a bit scummy depending on your opinions and how you see it. But in the end, if you want the game to be alive for as long as possible, you should understand their move
---
i get away with 100 slots pretty good on most my alts though. its all thanks to the copper fed salvage o matics and the portable merchants (and ofc the shared inv slots), and if you planned to anyway, the portable ecto gambling items that work as merchants with a sell function only. the window even stays up as you move around. the "deposit all" was a very good feature to help with inventory management as well.
---
i rarely actually ever need more than the base 100 slots for anything i do in game. sure ill have to manage inventory a bit more often than someone with 320, but thankfully the management can be done in mere seconds these days.
---
I could certainly try! I have one I’m taking right now with two characters so I’ll see how that goes and let you know!
---
11 Million Strong!
---
Only 1 mount skin every major free update costs around 20 USD lol.
---
If you do not get topic message it is clear: "I would pay full box price for a complete game/expansion every now and then" not "I want to pay every now and then for half assed asset flip and major gameplay updates/overhauls of aging game"
---
They want my money, better work to offer me something decent in exchange...
---
Or using your words... "where's this magical money to buy qol that must be baseline going to appear from through?
---
Reaper does just fine in fractals. It may not be optimal but it's not a bad choice.
---
There are two types of players in GW2: those who use arcDPS templates, and those who don't. FWIW, I'm part of the latter group.
---
Those who don't use arc templates will see this update as welcome addition, or just won't care, since they don't use templates now.
---
But for those who used arcDPS templates, they went from having unlimited number of builds FOR FREE to now having a very small number of free builds, and being required to pay $$$ for additional ones.  
---
All this for a feature that was available for free in GW1, and has been asked for since GW2 went live.
---
If you can't then understand why this has some people upset, please seek out a grown up and have them explain it to you.  Thanks.
---
Ugh there's that buzzword "pReDaToRY". As if any monetization is an affront to the noble working class. We literally don't even have a price point yet and you're already decrying it as anti-consumer. It's childish.
---
I'm not against monetizing build templates but how arena net is doing it. I'd rather just buy the feature than being sucked over and over again for the same thing.
---
Anet has gotten us, 2 equip slots and 3+3 build slots, giving us the free slots to make it seem "great" but if you look at it, they got us where they want us to be, either buy more equip slots, or buy character slots, either way they earn $$$
---
TBH it is a great feature to be added in, we all wanted these for so long and it's finally coming. It sucks they monetized it very cleverly that it pisses a lot of us off (for those who realize anyway) but all in all this is what we wanted. End of the day it's "Use it or don't" kinda thing, if you wanna utilize it better, spend on it, if not then yeah a few clicks here and there should do the trick.
---
Very clever Anet...You got us good...
---
it doesnt matter how much it cost tho, the method they're selling it stays the same
---
Why bother asking a question thay will never, and probay *can* never be answered?
---
A question like this is as answerable as "Why didn't you mow the lawn on Oct 15, 2010?"
---
I mean... Assuming that you had a lawn and that was an appropriate day to do something like that.
---
The point is, the answer is probably, "I don't know. Someone probably had to choose the priority order of things and chose some other task to schedule instead".
---
Wait, wait... I will have to buy build templates?
---
so it's too expensive for you
---
But...but...we don't even know the prices yet.
---
Yeah, by continuing to milk mount skins/gear skins/outfits. You know, things that don't negatively impact your enjoyment of the game when you get to the next raid boss and have to stat swap for the umpteenth fucking time. Not something that should have been included in the game years ago, and has been provided to the community for free by delta for the past 1-2 years already.
---
The only talks about templates :c 
---
We play without it somehow so why you start this discussions after they make it?
---
Holy hell dude. You're taking his comments as some kind of attack for some reason, but he's just stating the cost and what he thinks is worth his money. Maybe you *should* try to consider the context of his statement lol fucking whoosh, holy shit.
---
Yeah, gotta agree with you on everything here.
---
Yes, exactly. By definition Arc breaks ToS and you were allowed to use it for years anyway. You have no base for complaints.
---
Oh btw... Dont like it, dont buy it. Or leave. But we know you wont.
---
You really think those updates are worth 20€? Low standards imo.
---
The fact is arc dps will not be an option anymore.
---
Deltaconect agree with anet to let the arc build template without any update or kind of fixing.
---
So after the release the arc template will be down. Maybe you could still use it for a month or so.
---
Despite the fact the feature is monetized. A lot of raider have far more then 6 template. For my own I have like 20 template.
---
Why not paying for slot with gold. I mean not using gold to have gem, but in-game gold purshase.
---
Casual player are not really impacted by the way anet want to release the feature. But the hl community is and a lot.
---
I also did the math. 
---
You don’t need to buy them = $0.
---
#MINDBLOWN
---
Great, build templates aren't really catering to you in the first place then??
---
It might be not real money, but it's a couple of *hours* of grinding. Let's say you only earn by getting amalgamates - 7 of them is a 2 h 15 min run, each one is 98 s right now. So after removing fees it's 83 s. One day is about 6 g with those 2 and sth hours. So 50 g is about 21 hours of doing HoT and PoF meta events.   
---
That excludes other types of earning, but as you can see, we spend our time here instead of money. Idk how much time it takes to make such a drawing but I would say 50 g is still a fair price. But more? I would argue.
---
Two equipment and 3 trait/skill. Not enough for professions like Elementalist or Mesmer.
---
Guild Wars 1.
---
I absolutelty hate the trend that absolutely everything they release is tailored towards monetarization. Even a minor thing like cooking. That's why PvP and WvW updates take so long, they can't make money on it, so it's not a priority. GW2 is more and more like a freemium mobile "game"
---
It is not only raiders, you read alot of post of people who have tons of builds for open pve, fracs, raids and wvw all together. And you cant you arcdps templates anymore after they release their own build templates.
---
cause Arcdps isnt going to update build templates anymore and will probably be unusable soon. on top of that, who are build templates made for if not raiders? you dont need it in pvp, wvw players tend to have separate toons for their wvw stuff, and open world... you dont really need a build for. so who's that leave? fractals and raids. but sure, let's be happy for the open worlders to say they have a separate build fo use
---
makes me want to recover my GW1 account.
---
Yes everyone would rather have the system free and unlimited. However the response by those people still highlight to the Dev's that 2 aren't enough. If they made it extreme and had like 15 slots I doubt we would hear much on that front.  
---
Also the argument you follow with is one of the reasons games are so messed up. Our game isn't as bad as X game so we should get away with it. The bar then keeps moving as others get more extreme and that is the reason we have so many mirco transactions in all games now. Gonna try not get into that argument into how screwed the industry is on that front but wanted to highlight how harmful that argument is.
---
400 gems per each of 19 slots
---
You have barrier and shroud which significantly increase your effective health. In pvp it may not have as big value compared to long blocks, multiple evades or invulns, but in pve it's more than strong since you can avoid most hard hitting skills and other classes usually bring none of the defensive mechanics from above.
---
There's a reason why power reaper is god tier build in general pve.
---
getting real tempting these days
---
Absolutely
---
Imagine going against jormy without the flame legion
---
Imagine going against icebrood corrupted flame legion
---
Not to start shit, but I timed myself and it took me exactly 45 seconds to casually change my entire build (every trait, every piece of gear). 
---
I'm looking forward to the ability to share my builds, though.
---
* Build templates were already a feature in GW1
---
* Build templates have existed free for the past 1-2 years thanks to Delta
---
The bitching is for quite good reason
---
Gee, entitled much.
---
Again, it is easy to think about stuff that you think are the correct way to go. However, reality doesn't work that way and many things might not work or might be more complex to implement the way you think it should be.
---
They gave the reason that it was a design decision that they didn't want to give the player the opportunity to break other equipment templates and then probably complain why this is possible.
---
I mean, they did say that they didn't came to a **good** solution, So while they could have come to a solution it might be more complex to implement and a "simple info" solution might not be a good solution.
---
Oooooh I see! Thank you.
---
I won't buy it, as templates aren't important to me, as I've already stated.
---
But the point is, this change will likely hurt ANETs business more than it will benefit it, since this is likely to drive some players away from the game (as you so tactfully put "or leave") over this, which will hit their bottom line possibly more than any revenue increase they would see from the average player who just doesn't care about multiple builds.
---
I realize low hanging fruit like you doesn't see this, but you should just trust in those smarter than you, people like me, that we know what we are talking about.
---
You see thats where the issue is.Deltaconnected aka the dev of arc has an agreement with ANet that if they ever release official Build Templates he has to kill his third party Build templates. I would love to continue using arc but its just not a possibility
---
It's definitely **A** reason, of many.
---
Well, as I said, it's about sustainable revenue. You just don't like it
---
and this is the moment, you should realize that you are wrong and your whole post isnt based on the facts
---
I am also pretty sure there is a lvl 78 karma breathing mask somewhere
---
Well i'm not denying that the people that are affected by this in my specific example are probably a minority but don't you think it leaves quite a sour note that those that put in the extra effort on gaining legendary gear now are the ones being left behind? I mean overall there is more to this problem than just the upcoming build templates and i thoroughly agree that 3 gear templates should have been the minimum to start with but i can't help but feel uneasy with whats coming.
---
My biggest personal hope would be that they decouple the storage space from the total of gear templates. Basically give you 16 (19 with underwater?) slots for storing gear (per set, aka starting with twice the amount) you can buy more of but if you are willing to just store the things in your inventory you might as well make as many templates as you want.
---
The same kind of casual as u/kalamari__, probably. Meaning no disrespect to casuals, but if you're not going to be affected much by the monetisation of build templates that have existed for free for the past year, then tbh build templates aren't catering to you in the first place.
---
You are the reason shit like this gets accepted
---
No more waiting on patches or having to constantly update tho, and it’ll save inventory slots as you can store your gear.
---
Go back to the circus you clown
---
Maybe it's a good thing we don't get new elite specs.
---
Oh, ARR for GW2 would be great.
---
I'm just making a joke about the hundred meaningless fetch quests between the end of ARR and Heavensward :P
---
YES. This, so much. And as to how would it work? Just check out SWTOR.
---
this is not a good reason. You also dont pay that your ingame settings will be saved on servers and not on your computer. Shitty argument
---
It's still more than you had before without relying on (technically not allowed) third party tools. People have managed to play ele and mesmer just fine before, and it's *really* not that much effort to swap a weapon out.
---
I get its not Guild Wars levels of build templates, and I agree that a higher limit would be better (though seriously, not 500+), but let's not pretend this isn't an improvement over what we had before.
---
Legendary armor especially would be a good candidate seeing as their entire purpose is sidelined if you don't have enough gear template slots.
---
But shouldn't templates cater to those that want more? Aren't they the demographic that needs templates the most?
---
I almost got baited :(
---
Not possible, ArcDPS Buildtemplates won't be usable anymore after official build templates are out. It was the deal the dev (deltaconnect) struck with anet so the addon would be allowed.
---
It's not free if it costs actual money. That's kinda like saying your car comes with a free windshield. It's only free if you ignore the tens of thousands you just spent.
---
It's also not something anyone asked for. We've already dealt with the inventory problems of multiple gear sets. Mostly by getting gems and buying more bag slots.
---
Sure, the inventory slots would be nice... If the build templates didn't cost money. I would gladly take free ones that don't free up inventory spaces. If that's the whole reason they cost money, I'm fine with my gear sets staying in inventory.
---
Easiest fix:
---
Remove the Warclaw
---
1. I'm not sure how to comment on this, given that it's speculation. Also, given that this feature was available in GW1, I don't have much sympathy for the devs finally getting around to creating it
---
2. I play much more than 3 builds in both raids/fractals and WvW lol. I get unlimited slots free with arc templates. This is a downgrade and there's not really any way you can argue that, mate.
---
I know you get 3 slots per game mode. That's great, until I remember that I play more than 3 builds on a good deal of classes, and I'm quite far from the only one to do so, as you can see from the current disappointment on Reddit.
---
It would have worked the same, but with a gold cost each time you spoke to the trait-reset NPC. I would imagine.
---
so, buying an expansion with a big feature like this would not be paying for it?
---
I've read that part of the deal was that ANet agreed to allow Arc templates while they didn't have their own, but that once ANet's went live, Arc's would be disabled.
---
Many players *do* in fact get (third party) features taken away from them though.
---
I made a couple of legendary armours for classes with big build diversity and Arc let me comfortably switch stats for any occasion. Now arc will not work anymore and I made those legys for nothing, because I sure as hell won't be purchasing 5-10 template slots per character.
---
I wonder if I can swing "I'll probably never use it" into free gems?
---
I know it is not only raiders but his what was he/she aimed at. Allthough regardless of it there are still more players not using it then there are players using it. If we look at reddit then there is likely more people using it becaus they are aware and are more involved in the game then the causal player, but outside of this ArcDPS is not common knowledge and why implementing it too the game is by far better and will hopefully even create more awareness of builds.
---
It was not technically not allowed. ArcDPS was explicitly allowed. It's worse than arc. It's not an improvement over what we had before.
---
Why almost everything in the game is locked behind gemstore? Why can't we just unlock this with ingame "achievements" ?   
---
Reach level 80 in Spvp &gt; unlock 1 tab  
---
Reach rank 1000 in WvW &gt; unlock 1 tab  
---
Complete all fractals &gt; unlock 1 tab  
---
Clean X raid wings &gt; unlock 1 tab  
---
I'm so tired of this "you don't have to play the game to have nice things, just buy them in gem store" shit  
---
I want to feel that I "earned" those things, not that I grinded my ass off to buy them (or passed my visa)
---
Indeed!  On my ranger ive got a druid, bk, hk, condi shortbow template   and ranger isnt even my main xd
---
Best answer given!
---
If you think this is bad wait until the final three week before the next episode where everyone is claiming the game is going under.
---
And i have 53 alts and i am still not hyper ventilating over it, even though on my main ele in WvW i swap build and gear probably 10 times every evening.  What is your point?
---
&gt; I still think this is pointless
---
You think this is pointless but felt it was important enough to create a reddit thread?  Logical.
---
This is almost on par with ESO and their outfit slots. Greedy as hell.
---
Absolutely. I've wanted this for years. And players would have stomached the monetization of fashion templates far more than build/gear templates.
---
Many already did. The game is not doing better for it.
---
You don't "need", but you still want to optimize what you can.
---
The "average" casual for me is a player using maybe 3 alts in open world and maybe wvw. So if he uses templates at all he will maybe need around 6. And that is assuming he isnt one of the "that weapon looks good so ill use that" people.
---
If you want to compare that to the "avarage" raider running maybe 2 classes with 1 static build, ye the casual "wins" in number of templates assuming the raider only raids. 
---
So both of them are most likely fine with the provided free templates or a minor upgrade.
---
Now there is the raider running in a static group trying to get the most out of his builds. How many templates is he using? What do you think? Wanna see my min-maxed chrono templates? 
---
And honestly if you stand around in open world for 1 min changing my build doesnt really matter. If you have to do that in raids it will lead to major downtimes. Imagine everybody manually changing his builds after every boss. So biggest beneficiary of templates are hardcore raiders wanting to keep fullclear downtimes to a minimum. 
---
Plus being used to unlimited arc templates while now getting a downgrade which they even expect you to pay for feels bad.
---
Yeah, this place is rather crazy right now.
---
Well my guardian sometimes needs to be a dps and sometimes a healer.
---
That may actually be a way to avoid running out of template slots. Just get a notepad with the links and apply them when u need. Not the smoothest experience but is better than changing everything by hand
---
Clearly you don't use many builds.
---
Many classes have many different builds, where entire gear sets need to be replaced. For example, classes like thief don't live very long in their berserker raid gear, when in WvW. So if you only want to play thief in raids, and WvW, you will need at least two sets.
---
Thief is also a class that has viable Condi builds. Kinda memey in raids, but does work just fine if you aren't going all Snow Crows speed runs. That's another set if you want to do that. Also, Condi is viable in WvW, so, another set if you want to do that.
---
Thief also has access to a bunch of weapons. They change the playstyle of the class fairly drastically. Now, not all are exactly viable for raids, but certainly viable for a lot of PvE content, and sometimes, even a better choice. So you'll need all those. You'll also need a set for WvW, and some Condi versions as well.
---
So that's like 4 armor sets, 4 trinket sets, a few dagger sets, couple swords, a few short bows, couple pistol sets, couple staves, couple rifles. Don't forget the food. Even if you just want one condi and one power food that you split between every game mode, that's 4 slots right there. It adds up quick. If all you have is 20 slot bags and base amount of bag slots, you'll have like 5 open inventory spaces after you're done.
---
That's why people buy additional bags for gear. They do more than one thing on the class.
---
Dude you do realize that "me" stand for "all the people that are in the same situation"? Can you tell me how many are using template / arc right now?
---
Don't worry it won't be a charr. Most likely asura, human or salad. I'll pm you ^^
---
&gt;This is what build templates should have been for.
---
See, I disagree. First, raiding has a lot of dicking around time, waiting for people to set up and such. You're not at all pressed for time to trade off a few traits here or there, you don't need a build template for that. For the skills themselves, it's not even an issue since you can just have a plain text file with all your builds in them anyway, so really we're talking about swapping your equipment, and the equipment templates are gonna be doing something that arcdps could never do: store your gear. Don't use the templates for, like, switching one weapon out. Just do that manually. 
---
Where this is really going to shine is the fact that it's going to be hotkey-able, which means you'll be able to quickly swap entire builds in open world or WvW situations where quickly swapping between roles is useful. WvW because obviously, but open world PvE can quickly jump between solo play and group play and back again within minutes, and being able to play your character optimally in both of those situations is huge for QoL. That's functionality that you simply can't do right now (and, also, arcdps can't do either, because it's limited in its swapping time outside of towns). 
---
Lastly, expecting a company that needs to polish and sell something to do for free what a freelance developer does in their spare time is ridiculous. Arcdps is a great tool. It's not official and it would never be published officially in its current incarnation. It's a hack, fundamentally, while templates are integrated in the game. They never needed to allow arcdps to do what it did, but they did allow it on the condition that it was always going to be pulled from the game once they introduced their (obviously paid) template system. Getting pissed about that now is childish.
---
Always remember to do your daily asc mat crafting. Elonian Thread, Mithrillium, etc forgot the other names.
---
You will need those to craft your ascended equipment. Or can be sold in emergencies once you've stocked a few.
---
I'd say I personally would have stomached it better; but I'm not sure the entire subreddit would agree. 
---
As another comment somewhere in the outrage threads put it: For some people, the sky will ALWAYS be falling. :)
---
I feel like for PvE you could easily pare that down to power reaper, Condi scourge, and support scourge...which would neatly fit in your free slots.
---
And if you absolutely need all 15 builds on hand at a moment's notice, then yeah, I also think you should have to pay for that functionality. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Call me ignorant, but 15 just for your guardian?  Is this exaggerated or is there actually a need for 15 different armor sets just for one character to raid?
---
Can you?
---
That doesn't make the game hard.
---
For me, the "outrage" is that GW2 needs to attract more players, not drive them away.  For many in the community this change will be welcomed or will have no impact, but anyone who heavily used arcDPS templates will be disappointed if not outright angered by this change.
---
Will that drive some of them to leave?  Very possibly.  And that didn't have to happen if ANET had done this better.
---
I'll concede the Gear templates is a nice feature, which is exactly what they should have monetized, while giving players unlimited build templates.
---
This way ANET can raise $$$ by offering something arcDPS didn't.
---
Seems so simple, right? I'm not even in the video games business, but this is so black/white clear as day obvious, it's frustrating to think the devs are so narrow minded they can't see this.
---
I'm just worried that I have to probably pay $$$ a bit more than a expansions worth price on just build/Equipment build templates with the necessary amount I need to be satisfied with. Which in most cases in this game the "microtransactions" arnt really much micro anyways soo... I don't know in the end I feel a bit disappointed. Gonna go back to Gw1 where things weren't 200% monetized.
---
That's a good reason to release templates but does not explain why official version has to be garbage with a price tag.
---
The part that was in the previous game - the build templates - are free and unlimited via text codes. The slots are for hot-swap-able templates, but you can just store as many builds as you want for free and swap them around yourself with copy-paste.
---
The real limiting part, the equipment templates, were not in GW1. That was always the limiting factor here. Storing and recalling strings is easy, that's all that skills and traits are. Storing and recalling equipment is much, much more difficult.
---
Months from now no one will be able to live without them.  Kinda reminds me about the reaction to gliders in WvW. So much hate over something everyone accepts now.  Still manage to pull off air ambushes.
---
Fuck, I'm just gonna have to keep copy-pasting this comment, aren't I?

---
Same here. I'd pay a sub fee if I had the choice to incorporate all stuff from the gem store into the game. This is what I always say to myself whenever I think about how few cosmetics you can actually earn in-game compared to the gem store. (There are no mount skins you can earn in-game, no gliders besides the three legendary ones, how outfits are given so much priority when so few in-game armors are released by comparison, how some raid rewards are put into the gem store instead of being boss drops, loot boxes, etc.) 
---
Sure you can farm gold and just buy X skin but it feels better and more immersive to have earned that skin by accomplishing something unique that shows people that you were able to dodge 500 lightning strikes or whatever. To have the path for a large portion of the cosmetic items being a credit card or doing the same gold making method to convert to gems diminishes that, as every reward from the gem store is earned that way.
---
All those things are expected for their b2p business model for a mmo that's no longer releasing expansions. Even during HoT/PoF I get it. They're a business out to make money and I was still able to get thousands of hours of entertainment with more to come. Compared to any other game's cash shop I've experienced, Anet has the best store for the business model that they choose.
---
However if I had a choice to pay a sub fee to have all that stuff be actually incorporated into the game (cosmetics and quality of life features like the build templates) then I would pay one too. Nevertheless that won't happen because the sub fee models for most games don't make nearly as much money as the current system does. That's why mobile games are so popular with shareholders.
---
Guild Wars 2 is not a bad game. Plenty of these redditors are critiquing it because we're passionate about it (not always in constructive ways with myself included). While the b2p gem store model works for Gw2-- the game world would be much more enveloping if the store wasn't in your mind at all. That is worth a sub fee.
---
Note: If I got anything wrong feel free to correct me.
---
Braindead to play and braindead to fight sometimes. Just wait for both dodges to be used and then pressure hard to kill.
---
Skilled players know to either run away from most fights or have to wait for the chain CC to stop before trying to combat say holos or warriors or thieves or mesmers
---
&gt;	I think that anet should make you pay for whatever core functionality of the game you are reliant on, coz hey! 
---
Funny stuff!
---
So you're claiming to be "reliant on" a "core functionality" that isn't even part of the game yet? That's hilarious. If you're using the Arc system, you have known this was coming, and you've essentially been using a free workaround that ANet *permitted*, with the alternative being lots of time, or gems for new character slots. 
---
You do not need 15 templates on one character. You can play the game (that pesky core functionality you're talking about) with exactly *zero* build templates. They're nothing more than a timesaver, QoL. 
---
And if you can't survive or see any point in going on unless ANet gives you 15 build templates per character, then as far as I'm concerned good riddance. Stop playing the game, and the rest of the population will be better off without you. Less load on the servers from someone who clearly sees gems as being out of the question, even for QoL functionality that would really benefit them.
---
It always cracks me up when people bitch and moan about new gemstore skins and suggest that, rather than ANet making that kind of content, to drum up income to provide them with a non-subscription gaming experience...and instead demand that ANet should focus on exactly what *they* want, but of course it should be supplied totally free.
---
No. He has no idea what hes talking about. Straight from the source, it sounds like itll be each character will have 2 for free, with legendaries able to go anywhere as the gear will be character bound outside of legendaries. 
---
&gt;Each of your characters will have access to two Equipment Template tabs for free, and the first will be automatically populated with an Equipment Template containing the gear your character was wearing when you last logged in. You can purchase additional Equipment Template tabs from the Gem Store.
---
Don´t you think that they did not think about that? There is probably a bigger reason and problem behind that which they can´t fix easily.
---
It's the biggest entertainment industry now and they pay developers very low wages for the expertise required under the assumption you should be grateful you get to work on games so not gonna accept that argument. When Ceo's get millions of dollars just for joining and huge bonus's while Devs as an example at blizzard have to live in shared flats and be Uber drivers on there spare time. The argument about the expense of making games is invalid, sorry it's just bull and been disproved over and over. I agree that they where going to monetize it but I was pointing out the argument of our game isn't as bad as the other so let our game off the hook isn't healthy.
---
Its been free in GW2 for almost a decade too, with a better implementation. So whats your next excuse?
---
Same. I always get asked why do you have more than one of a profession. Because I can set up different playstyles and play with more fashion. For me it was always faster to swap characters to change from power to condi BS than deal with a third party tool or manually changing everything.
---
Well, I will not say that, however I will say that if you made legendary for QoL you did it for the wrong reason. It is much cheaper and QoL to have multiple ascended sets (I agree it's not how it should be, and legendary gear should have something more in the build templates, but they said that it's not a fully completed feature and they need feedback, so there's hope).
---
Also it's not like they are "taking" anything out of legendary stuff as it were, you probably crafted it way before build templates were announced and before build templates you had to manually swap anyway... So, they didn't take anything from you.
---
Keep in mind I do think they should have done something extra for legendary items, but the honest truth is that legendary is more cosmetic than it is QoL, build templates could have been a good way to improve the QoL part of it, but they are not (yet?)
---
The way I'm seeing it now is, I don't h
---
ave 3 sets in my bag and manually change them every time I want to play another build. And that is great... The legendary stuff, there's hope for a better feature I guess.
---
What’s a build template
---
&gt; This outrage over build templates is the ultimate sign that the guild wars 2 community is just burned out and would protest for the most minimal thing. I just a saw a post of someone who is leaving the game because the build templates being monetize... like wtf
---
Don't judge about the whole community because of a single player or a few players...
---
Obviously some people said it. You said that the majority said they would pay for it though and the top voted response to that thread says it should be free. And the second top. And the third top. And fourth top.
---
See that's one of the problems, necro is "just fine" or "ok" most of the time. There isnt a lot that necro excells at or is worth the effort.
---
Necro can eek out a lot of damage but its a lot of work to get that extra 2% damage out that its not worth it.  Play holo and use a specific rotation every few seconds and do more damage apply more buffs and cc than a necro can even with a super carefully made and maintained rotation.
---
&gt;anet doesn't give a fuck about what u guys have to say
---
And that is a good quality to you from a development team struggling with employees been fired and the publisher wanting to close them?
---
No, there's three sides of the argument actually:
---
The people that are going to buy build templates and have no issue with it.
---
The people that are going to buy build templates while loudly bitching about it.
---
and
---
The people that don't give a fuck.
---
Metabattle.com snowcrows.com lucky-noobs.com
---
Baseline is you get 2 equipment templates, and (seemingly) you can buy up to four more per character. That actually is really bad for people who play ranger and chrono especially, because raiders who play those classes typically have more than 6 (sometimes even more than 15 for min-maxing purpose) on current ArcDPS templates.
---
What I'll probably end up doing is having baseline equipment templates that I'll just have saved for my ranger to be able to have a normal raid support druid setup and a power soulbeast setup to start with as baselines, and switch weapons/upgrades and stats manually. If I decide to buy more down the road for convenience later, then I'll do that.
---
As for chrono, idk what I'll do. Because that one has a power dps, various combinations of zerker+diviner for support, commander for low-pressure tanking, minstrel for high-pressure, and several other setups. A lot of chrono mains have a lot more setups to play around with than I do (condi chrono support, condi dps chrono, condi mirage, etc.), so they're even more screwed.
---
10 open world builds can probably clear most raids.
---
Again, gw2 isn't hard, the combat system is great though and people love to optimize it.
---
I was personally not expecting to have to pay for templates for each character separately.
---
I think it's even easier in SWTOR, you can "outfit" slots for your character in which you can save a setup you like (except weapons of course) and to "save" the outfit the first time you pay credits (the ingame money, like gold in GW2). You can then switch back from any outfit slot and your main appearance as you like, free of charge. If you modify something (change the helmet skin for another one for example) you'll have to pay again.
---
The amount of credits seems to be level dependent, so it's better to set it up fast (if you can that is).
---
You can also unlock more outfit slots for Cartel Credits (gems in GW2) or usual credits (gold).
---
Works really well to be honest, and allows for easy roleplay for those interested.
---
Dye system sucks though, so a mix of both games would be wonderful.
---
na nevermind was wrong there
---
Well maybe this indeed do sound screwed
---
Specially for the gear logouts, since they have their own storage.
---
I understood it as per template, meaning you have 2 build slots on every character and if you buy 3 more you have 5 on every character. I'll wait for the pricing before I get my pitchfork out, I'm happy to let someone else get upset for now
---
Oh I know they have, u/Anet-PaulS already mentioned it, but I'd rather highlight what an improvement it'd be (at least for some) than let the opportunity slip because it didn't have an easy fix.
---
What you suggest is how it was in gw1.  If you didn't have the gear in your ineventory it just wouldn't equip it.  I don't know if they simply did not thing equipment templates through very well or they simply wanted to make two products to sell.
---
While I'm happy to have build templates in the game equipment templates feel a bit lacking...
---
For players that utilize account bound equipment on multiple characters these equipment templates do nothing for that.  They will still need to be made to move the physical items from character to character and if legendary select the stats and runes/sigils.  This is the majority of the inconvenience these templates should eliminate.
---
Apparently people don't want to hear about these flaws.  I like you will buy the build templates but the gear templates are meh.  Why buy equipment templates when you still have to manually move the gear from character to character?
---
Asks a question
---
Get's banned from twitch chat.
---
I think it provides nice QoL at no added cost to the vast majority of players.
---
For those who think they have to have a dozen templates per character, ANet has made that capability available to them for an added fee. 
---
I think that's more than reasonable, assuming the price is reasonable.
---
What I think is unreasonable is this whole line of reasoning that says, "I didn't get exactly what I want for completely free, so if you're happy, you're wrong! And it's not for you!"
---
selling you an optional feature that we've been able to live without for 7 years is not in any way, shape or form "predatory".
---
SWTOR had a feature like that. It's legitimately one of the few things I miss about that game after moving to GW2.
---
Possibly, but Blizzard is often made fun of for having 'spaghetti code'.
---
I'd also say that in many ways the inventory system in GW2 is far superior to either of those other games. The wardrobe system GW2 added was effectively stolen by both of them a couple of years later. The wallet system for currency is somewhat used by both of them, but is superior in GW2. The deposit all reagents from anywhere is still a massive convenience that neither of the other two have etc.
---
Poeple are just complaining about limited free equip template slots, not happy that they are literally an inventory expansion. And we already got one for free.
---
Of course the others won't be free ffs.
---
its actually hilarious that every time there's criticism someone comes and whines about people giving legit feedback
---
&gt;BANG, everyone is then happy.
---
You have never changed between few similar, but different and  precisely tuned to various situations (fractal precision/spotter/banners/different sigils and runes/different toughness or boon duration/infusions etc) gear sets. Like you are going to remember them all. Like you are going to go and click stats and upgrades on every single piece of armor and find that special piece of jewelry in your bag.
---
Build templates themselves aren't as important. Up to nine traits, up to 5 skills, not that much clicking. It is gear templates where problem is, and two sets is insanely small number (so is six, honestly). And people give much less fucks about gear storage (not that bag slots weren't monetized for years now), but about a-net taking away easy gear switching.
---
 Yeah, I can perfectly imagine how for some people, already hurt by questionable class design choices, raid/fractal content neglect and the insult that is a strike mission this would be a push strong enough to leave the game. Imagine your typical chrono main, for example.
---
This game from the very beginning had a monetization method of selling QoL and skins tradeoff for no subscription cost. 
---
The $15 per month they are missing from you they have to make it in some other way, and if you aren't paying anything at all they need to entice someone else to pay for the equivalent of your $15 and for their own $15. For every 100 people not paying anything they need to get the equivalent of those 100 x $15 from the remaining people willing to spend.
---
I chose my words poorly; maybe "minute" wasn't the best term.
---
Think of the "minute" adjustments as changing runes or stats to fulfill the same role. For example, you might want Thief Runes on your power firebrand in raids to cap crit chance, but you want scholar runes instead in fractals since you get more crit chance in fractals. Or maybe you want pack runes for more boon duration for less optimised groups.
---
So it's basically the same role (quickness providing power firebrand), but every time you make an adjustment in the role you need to change runes/stats on your equipment. Without templates, having to switch out all the items all the time quickly becomes a chore.
---
Sorry that you're trying to put words in my mouth, but quoting me on things that were never said is rather childish. I'm stating a blunt fact that a lot of people tend to forget, and thats the fact that a community is made up of many people of many different personality types. Just because everyone isn't helpful and fun to play with doesn't make them any less a part of this game. I'm not justifying what they do or how they act, I'm simply saying that no matter your opinion on the matter, they exist. That's a standard fact of life.
---
I played WoW from vanilla to Cataclysm and there was never a build template or an equipment template.  And just to change your spec cost gold with increasing cost (to a cap).  Saying it is a basic feature is a bit of a stretch.
---
Time to spread those builds around different characters if you don't want to use gold to buy some build tabs.
---

We didn't buy a free-to-play game. We bought a buy-to-play game that turned into a free-to-play Korean mobile game.
---
HoT was the right direction for most of us. Since PoF, they've been catering to an entirely new audience.
---
You would pay the silver? How is that possibly an issue?
---
Are they? I thought they were pre-Legions tribal Charr, although I suppose in functional terms there isn't a huge difference.
---
It would mean that I would only ever need 1 set of heavy berserker, instead of 3 for my power builds.
---
While it would be lovely for new players, it would invalidate loot and legendary convenience. (only ever need 18 pieces (6 light, medium &amp; heavy)
---
And once you have 18 pieces of legendary armor any and all ascended drops are useless... even less are needed for trinkets. Once you complete the set (we are at 4/6 legendary trinkets  right now) you'll never need another trinket ever again...?
---
😂😂👌 do you believe these people? XD
---
6 legendary armor pieces, all legendary weapons, 4/6 legendary trinkets. Getting 2 storage spaces in exchange for limitation on stat swapping convenience is a terrible trade to me.
---
Ah, different question. Let's see....well, do you remember what the build system was like back then? It was very different from today's streamlined specializations; the details aren't completely important. The point is, it's clear in hindsight that they were still iterating the system. They weren't gonna devote the time to building a build template system for skills and traits if they weren't even sure if the trait system was going to stay the same. 
---
Second, and probably more important at launch, was the fact that we couldn't freely swap traits around at launch, remember? We were expected to go to a vendor and buy a trait swap manual for some (not insubstantial) gold cost. ANet thought that they'd need to do that to make people more attached to their character build or some other such nonsense. It's funny, because they did the exact same thing in GW1 with respec points, and then scrapped it after launch. Anyway, the point is, they weren't about to build a quick-swap build system into a game where they thought (before launch) that players wouldn't swap builds regularly, and would have to pay to do so.
---
That philosophy obviously changed, but by the time they figured it out, they a) probably also figured out that they wanted to change the entire trait system, and b) definitely were busy launching the start of Season 1, and so didn't have developer time to devote to making build templates.
---
So it's probably literally been on the table since the trait change to specializations, years ago. They've just now had the time to fit it in. It's not like they've done nothing in the interim; we've had a ton of other big QoL features (eg, wardrobe). And they let Arcdps exist as a stopgap while they worked on it. 
---
So, that's why. They didn't want it or think the game needed it at launch. By the time they realized their mistake, they didn't have the time for it. And by the time they started to have time for it, they wanted to make it bigger than just build templates and include gear templates, which made it a bigger project and therefore take longer. 
---
Pretty easy to figure this stuff out if you start from the assumption that they're **not** assholes or morons, but rather are just imperfect people trying their best to deliver the features that they think the players will most appreciate, factored against the time it'll take to deliver them.
---
A non-annoying way could be triggering a notification when we logged a gearless character, as when they reset selectable trinkets "Hey, some of your stats got reset! / You are missing some gear" (although that might have been mail and I know they don't like using mail willy-nilly).
---
Aaand I'd bet the second issue had already been dealt with, same as how you can't equip account bound racial gear. Just a guess tho.
---
never played WoW so i wouldn't know. GW1 had this since factions and its a feature in basically every modern MMO. It should have been in gw2 since launch.
---
Thank you for saying this. People need to think about what this word really means. 
---
Predatory means it involves some kind of behavioral psychology manipulation in order to extract more money out of the player than they would otherwise want to spend. These types of practices are incredibly effective and practically coercive to those that are vulnerable to it. 
---
For example, people prone to gambling problems are particularly hurt by loot boxes and how they can become incredibly addicting looking for those big dopamine highs of striking it big. 
---
Just because you don't like a monetization model, doesn't make it predatory.
---
ANet respects your time a lot more than other MMO companies, and actually is much easier with its monetization than most companies. That's the difference with the wardrobe and the wallet system. That's a separate matter from how well the underlying database is put together. ANet tends to not...future proof its systems too much, so reworks and additions end up being much more difficult than they would be for other companies.
---
I wish they had 1 more equipment template per character.  Not sure why we have 3 build slots and only 2 equipment slots per character.  That doesn't make a lot of sense to me.
---
No its not and that a disgusting and idiotic thing to say.
---
&gt; The problem with giving people unlimited storage space is that, frankly, they will use it - and when you're dealing with hundreds of thousands or millions of accounts, that can lead to databasing issues alarmingly quickly.
---
I don't think you need a Database at all because those things could be saved in the local.dat file in your player profile. And since you can share build templates it would be possible to just store the hash value that already represents the build.
---
As for the equipment template, I don't have an answer for that. Still 3 to 6 seemed weird to me for a "storage" thing.
---
That's a good point to remember, thanks!
---
My post is based on experience and logic. You trying to stir up things based on 'there is no proof the moon won't fall on us tomorrow'. Entertain me more.
---
Its odd that its easier to just get an ascended one from the winterberry vendor in Bitterfrost, provided you have that LW episode.
---
Even in the early hot maps the masteries were optional shortcuts. Literally got ye there faster instead of being the only way.
---
&gt; With some exceptions I can understand the complains about the templates. 
---
Hey, we're circlejerking here and painting this as a simple have vs have not issue.
---
&gt; guild wars 2 community
---
Only a small portion of the player base uses reddit, and only a portion of the reddit community uses ArcDPS, and only a portion of those uses the build template add-on.  
---
I understand why those players are angry: they had everything for free and now they'll have to pay to support a couple builds. But those players are nonetheless a tiny minority (albeit a vocal one at the moment), not the "GW2 community" as a whole.
---
that would be nice, i already have like 3 go-to styles and when i switch them i always forget the dye channels so i have to spend time being unsure and reapplying them
---
Fair enough, i guess this "punishes" (over arcdps) those that like to do a lot on single char unless they pay up.
---
It's almost like half the people commenting seem to have forgotten that developing and maintaining an MMO is *extremely expensive*, and in order to continue not charging us a sub fee ANet needs to make their money in other places. This isn't motivated by greed, but by a desire to keep making the game and having a job, and I'd personally rather pay for some extra convenience now and then than get everything for free for about a year before the game implodes. Honestly, you'd think people wouldn't need this spelled out for them.
---
&gt;What is your point?

What is yours?

I think Tyria is an intelligent design where we have a sayng about the general weather.

---
**exactly**
---
I like analogies.
---
So much this \^. Thats my major criticism. Right now i can use arc to swap my legy gear around like i want. I want unlimited equipment templates and idm having all the gear in my inventory. If i need more space i would buy bag slots and not template slots.
---
aww, thank you!
---
Danm that's amazing
---
I just put on whatever has the highest stats for me in the moment LOL I know nothing about this game
---
I suspect many veterans just farm gold and buy gems with gold, but neither of us has proof of this so this won't go anywhere. 
---
It is true you don't need $15 per month to keep the game afloat, but the game exist for profit, not just to make enough money to not close doors. When a game only generates enough money to stay afloat you get a Wildstar situation, it reaches the point where it's a waste of resources that could be used on a more profitable game. 
---
Anet doesn't owe people content, but they have to keep pushing content if they want people to keep spending in their gem store, this is all part of the same tradeoff they made in exchange for no sub fee. The content they develop isn't being made for free, it's made with the expectation that it will generate revenue through gemstore purchases, no content means no one will have any motivation to spend.

Id pick char slots
---
Can be re-used, played with the lvl80booster trial, a new profession /race or just kept as a mule for storage (more than a bank tab)
---
So we are gonna lose arc dps templates and gain nothing but shit. Anet never fails to disappoint me.
---
Okay I dislike how build templates are being done but you jumped the shark with that comparison. The two are in no way equal.
---
No one important is going to quit the game over freakin' build templates. Barely anyone is actually going to use them, which is why it took them so long to implement them. The people in charge did not see value in spending the time needed for creating the feature.
---
&gt; Every piece of gear, on the other hand, is a database entry
---
...of a text string. Bytes of data.
---
Yeah, it's not the same as traits, there's obviously more going on, but it's ridiculous to pretend like this was any kind of technical undertaking. Gear in this game is not complicated, there's no crazy rng rolls or billions of possible weapons like in borderlands or something like that, a piece of equipment can be condensed down to a short string of text.
---
&gt; If you don't understand how data architecture works, stop laughing and try to learn something. This isn't difficult to grasp.
---
Neither of us work for anet, and everything we're discussing is conjecture. Cut the condescension.
---
So wait, you're saying the solution to an in game problem is to use an out of game tool?
---
So why just not use arc at that point
---
I'm aware, but it's still an additional feature of the system that partially alleviates the baseline of 3 builds per character that we're getting. I wasn't trying to present it as some kind of magical feature that we should be grateful to have, merely saying that we did have that feature before because it's super simple to make text strings share-able. The question was "why did it take so long to get something that was free in GW1?" and there are multiple parts to that question, so the answer is going to have multiple parts as well.
---
I'd love one of my Guardian. Let me know what you'd want to charge, I'd be willing to do up to 500g.
---
I cant believe there is people complaining about some things...
---
Really?
---
"Uhhh, You gotta pay for more builds and equipaments template slots"
---
IMO, this new system is amazing. Sure I need to test it and get my conclusions, but come on...
---
ANET is a company. They made a great system that 90% of community was asking for years. 
---
Now they need to profit about it, of course! People complain about evertyhing....They dont know how real world works!
---
Sure, as long as we get PvE legendary backpiece then. Sounds fair.
---
Please no! I use visuals to quickly see what gear I'm running. E.g. on my druid my condi set looks toxic while my power set is heavy/blunt. And my heal set is bright and flowery.
---
Which means the ultimate goal of getting legendary armor is "nope, you really shouldn't". Current "customize" screen is a disaster and "hey, you can have TWO (two) selections easily available out of infinitely customizable stuff before your wallet gets kicked in the nuts" is not a very appealing proposition unless either gem costs are small-ish (100-200-300 gems or so) or we get "stored vs activated" bonus ways to store equipment template. As in "you can _store_ 6 builds per character but only have two active hot/swappable, so need to re-select from menu"
---
This comment chain is a prime example why discussing is so useless on the internet. Even if you completely destroy and dismantle the opposite opinion, the ones having that opinion will never change it anyways. Not even the ones reading this comment chain. Tribalism at its finest, and we even play the same fucking game.
---
I still play the game, I still think the build templates, as advertised, will improve my gaming experience. I think this conversation has as much to do with me as it does you, even if we will be using the system differently.
---
I just gambled for the achievement and stopped (the skritt one)
---
I think i went down around 100-200gold for it.
---
But i was up for 400-500at one point.
---
I wanted the achievement, and when i won 400-500 more than i started with ,the amount looked so small (cause i was spinning 100g+250 ectos per roll)
---
If it were moved to the slots your gear icons would no longer change, this wouldnt change anything, just look at the visuals of the icons
---
"So many nerfs and they're still OP"
---
Hell yeah, I could really get behind that :D
---
The thing is, anyone who cares about build templates would just keep using ArcDPS. It's not nearly enough of an extra hassle to justify spending money instead.
---
Any actual art commissions will charge you roughly $15-25 from what I can tell. Gems -&gt; Gold and you're looking at anywhere from 300-500g. Also, Amalgamated gemstones are a really poor way for obtaining gold. Just doing Silverwastes with a bag opener will net you more than that casually in 2-3 hours.
---
Bold of you to assume they're still playing the game.
---
You definitely won't be paying silver for that. 3s50c for each single point, on 80lvl character. How many points you would need to reset?
---
do you actually perform
---
High health pool does not "avoid" hard hitting attacks, it gets hit.
---
Avoidance mechanica are evades, blocks, invuln that actually avoid the damage. Even protection reducing damage is more defensive than just having a lot of health. 
---
Pve is easy, the damage is small and theres a lot of telegraphs and you can always run away after killing 1 or 2 enemies. Even raids are 2 manned by rangers and mmesmers and elles who have more options than just "more health".
---
More health also requires more healing to make up for when its lots. Ie the difference between a damage sponge and an actual tank.
---
Then again, anet isn't known for the best business decisions or consistency in their actions. What anet does or does not do is completely irrelevant at this point, what is relevant is what is needed by the playerbase.
---
And this ain't it, chief.
---
Storing stuff like that locally sounds like a great way to get people tampering with their builds remotely, not to mention it sort of breaks down if someone wants to play the game from multiple computers. Also, storing the hash value only benefits you if the chat links don't include the name you've given the build, which to be fair is entirely possible (and is probably quite likely, although not guaranteed).
---
As for the per-character limits, I would speculate that the current structure grew from not wanting to give players too much free bag space with the templates (as inventory space limitations are an important part of any MMO's economy), and the separation of Build and Equipment Templates along with the addition of Template Storage is a compromise between that and wanting to give players as much flexibility with their builds as possible. That's just an educated guess though - hopefully the upcoming Guild Chat will offer some insights.
---
The example is extreme but the logic checks out
---
that's exactly what has happened, what's happening now and what will continue to happen until the inevitable death of the game and anet. but hey, burying your head in the sand because the only part of the game you care about (buying gemstore shinies and 2 hours of story content every 3 or so months) is doing fine is cool. if it ain't my problem, it ain't a problem
---
Please no... i dont want to block 400+ players for spamming their guild recruitments in cyrillic in map/zone chat like in ESO all the time :(
---
No, it really doesn't. You pick an example that is so far removed from this that it's hysterical.
---
Ez game ez life
---
I hope they allow arc templates to keep updating.
---
It's not providing the same in game hotkey/gear storage functionality, and for most players is likely not in competition with the official build templates at all (how many run arc?).
---
not a private server game so no way to stick to a single build or change build versions.
---
what you want is an option in the options menu to simply disable the build templates feature.  I don't see that happening in the near future as it doesn't make sense for the long run.
---
No you can’t just have 9 Characters with no templated builds and 18 templates on one character.
---
This thread is a nice one to stroll through  [https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/90htov/discussion\_what\_are\_build\_templates\_worth\_to\_you/](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/90htov/discussion_what_are_build_templates_worth_to_you/)
---
Build templates are by and large useless, its the gear templates that are important as they save the most time if you have lege gear. Swapping skills and traits takes like 2 seconds.
---
Not over powered, niche. They do well at aoe spam but its easy to work around aoe spam. Dodge to avoid or run away. Movment beats static fields
---
"already exists for free"? Are you referring to Guild Wars, or just the MMO genre? 
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they had to justify the resources to NCSoft West to add this to the game by using this model. We get a few slots for free, at least. I've seen people say they have 12 builds for their chrono (which is ridiculous in my opinion), but this is a convenience feature.
---
We also don't know how much additional slots will cost. I believe nearly everything on the gem store has received a sale price at some point as well, so it's bound to happen with these in the future.
---
I prefer not to look at my inventory but instead look at my character model :)
---
Seriously one of the more exciting things that is probably overlooked about these equipment templates are the fashion options! You can have 3 sets of the same stats for different climates (Desert, Snow and Jungle for example). And swap as depending on the map you're in.
---
I wouldn't complaining if the unlock was account wide (they should do this with bag slots too =/). No gemstore unlocks should be soulbound, but some reason these two are.
---
&gt; ...of a text string. Bytes of data.
---
Dude. A free standing string is miles different from a database entry, ok? If you have never worked with databases, please stop talking. The fact that they're all 1s and 0s at their base level does not mean that they function similarly from a coding perspective. 
---
&gt; Neither of us work for anet, and everything we're discussing is conjecture. Cut the condescension.
---
It's not conjecture to say that copying and storing a string is far easier than cutting and moving around rows in a database, a database that the user can also "edit" manually by moving around individual pieces of gear. The gear itself does not need to be overly complicated. The process of storing the data for individual pieces of gear and then retrieving those pieces of gear when asked for is what's potentially complicated. 
---
Notice that GW1 never tackled the second issue. Notice also that ANet actually side-stepped the issue entirely, by forcing you to store all gear used in a gear template in a separate "inventory" so that you lose your ability to "edit" those database entries manually by clicking and dragging. 
---
This is not some grand technical achievement. I didn't say it was a herculean task. I said it was **more difficult** than build templates in GW1, and it obviously is, for anyone who understands data architecture. I do not need to know the underlying code base to make that statement, any more than I need to know the underlying code base to make the statement that build templates are a text string.
---
Delta commented themselves that arc templates will be discontinued when these launch.
---
Shit, I did it on 5 engis before arc was ever a thing. Relogging is an annoying way to swap template, but lemme tell ya: I don't regret it.
---
in the not so distant future people who still play the game are gonna be the only vocal minority left lol but just leave if you dont like it 4Head
---
I'm one of the left picture guy but with the right side guy's face.
---
Why ? Because I prefere this than nothing. Even if I can't understand why we don't have build templates since 2012. I remember we asked for it since the launch day. But I guess we'll have to deal with it so, better than nothing.
---
Fine by me! 
---
But in reality, despite the PvP and WvW legendary back pieces, I don't think further accessories will come from those game modes. I don't want to wait to Alliances until I have my full set of accessories, because I don't see them pushing new rewards there until that time.
---
Happens with any and every new feature.
---
You want everything for free and you want it your way. That sure sound like you are being entitled to me.
---
I think it *is* a database thing since the items in the templates don't take inventory space.
---
Then drop a few dollars or some gold. The whole argument for "it was free" is moot, Anet approved it only with a stipulation that it would be cut. You along with everyone else seen this being monetized, so why is this such a shock? I play a good 6 builds on my main with 5 gear sets so the whole "it doesnt affect you, you dont understand" is wrong. I'm dropping $10 in gems specifically because of this, that's less than me buying my lunch for one day at work which is a fair price to pay, delta works for free updating and creating new stuff for arc, would you also work for free? If he dropped a patreon I'd also donate to him because it's not fair to expect free stuff when people are working their asses off, I sure as hell wouldn't work for free unless it was a close friend.
---
Dunno what build your game is, but mine is 99335 and I haven't seen it in-game yet.

Hiya, thanks for the reply. Can you drop me your source? I'm now reading an article on commissions (time to educate myself) but I would like to take a look on what you used.   
---
Also, yeah, I know it's not the best way of farming, especially with those prices now (seriously, what the heck happened to the prices???????), but running Silverwastes is so freaking boring after some time. I have to focus on a mindless task all the time for 2 hours, if not, I'm outta the train. I like metas because I always have some time to make myself tea, watch something in between or feed my cat. I value convenience :)

---
It's not a necro wide issue at all and it certainly hasn't been like that since launch.
---
How will dye channels interact with the equipment templates? Will the different equipment tabs remember their dye selections?
---
&gt;      
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Because we have several gear sets and an invisible bag prevents it from popping up on the merchant list so we don't accidentally sell it. The same reason that any specified types of bags exist.
---
Who sells gear worth wearing? 
---
&gt;That's a good attitude to have. Who cares if a feature of the game is being impacted by something because you don't have it? It's only why the game's hardcore players are leaving.
---
Again, who cares if they do? The game's done just fine without "hardcore players." If anything, they've only caused more trouble than they're worth by advocating for content to be locked behind things like raiding. If they leave, long term it would probably work out better for most of the players. Have fun in Rapture.
---
&gt;Then the conversation about the criticisms of this system does not concern you.
---
Again, they do, because my response to the criticisms is "you like it less, I like it more." Positive viewpoints matter as well as negative ones.
---
Yeah, each set is easily going to be 800+ gems.
---
Get an education and learn how to argue, then we can continue this as a real discussion.
---
Extra bag slots cost money: No problem!
---
Extra bank slots cost money: No problem!
---
Extra character slots cost money: No problem!
---
Extra build templates cost money: **PROBLEM!!!**
---
See how silly you are being about the monetization of this?
---
Im hyped for these reasons. Especially the hotkey
---
[Don't forget what happens right before that](https://i.imgur.com/WwFecm6.png)
---
Warning: scuffed paint edit
---
That'd prob be the most elegant solution. Still would require a bunch of hooks between systems that could be complicated. The wardrobe system is probably completely isolated from the stat/equipment system, so writing extra pieces there could pose problems. I dunno tho, still could work after a bit
---
Thanks reading more on these!
---
Build templates were a very very highly requested item for years and years, so how is this not needed by their playerbase? My whole guild lost their minds over it in excitement even tho most of us use arc, we aren't salty because we all knew this was coming since build templates dropped on arc, there are seemingly those that somehow didnt which I have no idea how.
---
I don't really care who or what wished Arc was banned.  Anet has no obligation to pay ANY attention whatsoever to it.  They could have banned you for it and they didn't, beyond that they don't owe you shit.
---
WvW was impossible to play for months, because there were eternal squads of 40 scourges who would just run over entire guilds like a freight train, killing everyone in under a second and making it literally impossible to walk through any choke point in the game
---
I'll just repeat what I said to another user...
---
Extra build templates cost money: PROBLEM!!!
---
Have plenty of education thanks, not really interested in discussing you whining about a fucking free video game.
---
And you make up shit as you go. I think you've demonstrated your inability to understand the fundamental problems with the implementation of build templates by now. We can stop this now.
---
Super thorough answer, thank you! This is perfect.
---
That helps a lot, thank you!
---
Got it! Thank you!
---
maybe he thinks  scourges playing only with staff and spaming 1-5 marks :p
---
&gt; *extremely expensive*
---
Prove it.  They had some 200+ people just working on side projects with the GW2 income so obviously it wasn't that costly to keep in maintenance mode.
---
I don't feel I'm *superior*, only *more reasonable*. (I guess you could argue that my feeling that I'm more reasonable is a form of superiority...in which case I'd say I don't see it that way, but if you do, I don't feel particularly compelled to argue the point.)
---
I see this as a simple case of getting new QoL goodies, getting a bit of that for free, plus a small free early bird sample. 
---
QoL features in GW2 are features I expect to have to pay for, and I think that's reasonable. I'd rather have the option to pay for new content and QoL, or keep playing without them vs. a subscription model where you pay constantly no matter what. If someone feels differently, that's fine, but then maybe they should look into games with a monetization model that better suits them.
---
I'm not being hypocritical, no matter how much you might like that to be the case. And you're right in that you are within your right to complain about anything you don't like...but just the same I think your complaints and sense of entitlement are laughable and ridiculous...am I not just as within my right as you to express that sentiment as well?
---
open world casuals who literally havent changed their build in years LOL
---
"I don't like this, it seems greedy and unfair"
---
"*YOU ENTITLED BABY, YOUR OPINION IS SHIT AND BASED ON SHIT LOGIC*"
---
k dude, also not sure what logic you're alluding to, but whatever
---
if its 700 for 3 more slots, I'm just gonna make a new character LOL
---
The problem is that it isn't to your liking. That it costs money. Even though all other convenience items - bag slots, bank slots, and character slots, etc. - cost money. But you choose to get mad about build templates - a convenience item - costing money.
---
Your argumentation is wrong. Arc templates gets removed because of the poor design, and now, we have less than before. I think than monetization is good in bag, character and bank slots, but not this time.
---
Well you kinda demonstrated your unwillingness to discuss already by not arguing the points I brought up, but instead falling back on insults and strawmen. I can see that without you needing to point it out.
---
Good thing that's not what's happening, then.
---
&gt; And it isn't, because as the OP makes very clear, the Equipment tabs and "active build" tabs are character individual. 
---
So, I wouldn't doubt that this will be how they run it, but how do we know that? Did they announce it or are we just basing off of trends?
---
Euhh, I already did look there and tried to find the English version. I wouldn't have asked if I hadn't look first. Thank you though and there was no need to downvote me.
---
How many builds do you play per profession?
---
:/ hopefully their pricing model isnt gross to the point where itd make more sense to relog to do different roles even WITH templates.
---
This sounds like a smart solution.
---
&gt; Unpopular Opinion...
---
You got that right...probably the only thing you got right in this whole post.
---
&gt; Me no metaslave, me smart.
---
*Dies to first mob in story instance and complains how game is too hard for casuals*
---
This one is good. Thank you.
---
Arcdps costs nothing.
---
Why are build templates different than those other things? They are items of convenience. Well, maybe the character slots can be looked at as more than that, but still in the same category. There's no reason to complain about extra build templates costing money and not complain about bag and bank slots costing money.
---
This is the real reason why you cant link gear. They cant come out and say it, but yeaaa.
---
Yeah, true. Since I have no idea how Anet implemented all of this, I have no idea how much work it would need to get the fashion templates.
---
My suggestion is merely „if it could be done without a huge redesign of the code, I'd love to see it“. If it could be done somewhat quickly, I wouldn't mind them pushing back bigger features they haven't started developing yet. But I definitely don't want them to drop anything they are already working on for this. :)
---
I'm thinking that most of us would actually be content if the Living Story content was released as part of paid expansions (with extra features added such as more raids and fractals than what they are producing now (are they even producing any?)), and have basic QoL features be free.
---
It's how they choose their money that's making this community rile up, not the fact that they want money, which is understandable.
---
so. then tell me again: how is it free? or do you continue to talk around the arguments of other people.. (just a rethorical question, nobody needs an answer...)
---
Obviously, people that only play 1 or maybe 2 builds are not going to be affected. It may well have not even been implemented in the first place for these people. The vast majority won't use build templates to their full potential. I don't disagree. Why does that mean that the people who do use multiple builds, the people who have legendary gear and want to use this gear for their intended purpose, have to suffer?
---
I would guess that accomplishments more towards the difficult or grindy end are going to be overrepresented among accounts that have put in the effort to sign up with the site.
---
Copy pasting sc traits and skills = top dps?
---
we haven't had templates for 7 years, you will survive manually swapping.  The UI to swap stats is 100 times better than it used to be.
---
&gt; Extra bag slots cost money: No problem!
---
They did in GW1.
---
&gt; Extra bank slots cost money: No problem!
---
&gt; Extra character slots cost money: No problem!
---
&gt; Extra build templates cost money: PROBLEM!!!
---
They did **not** in GW1.
---
You don't need it. You really don't. Takes what 30 seconds top to change build and equipment? You really need to save 30 seconds each time you change spec?
---
And yet they're still OP
---
Just because you link a build, doesn't mean that's the build you have equipped.
---
&gt; Are you retarded?
---
Yes i am! Any problem? 
---
Its time to grow up and learn how bissiness around the world works.
---
You paid for the base game.  You got the base game.  Every single update since then you have paid nothing for.  Absolutely nothing.
---
I understand this is really hard for some people to understand so keep working at it.
---
1). I believe basic kits are fine for anything white, green, or blues under level 80. If you have the extra money to buy the kits you might as well salvage what you can as salvaging is how you can get [Essences of Luck](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Essence_of_Luck) which up your magic find. The runes and sigils you'll be getting on most equipment will be next to worthless, so don't worry about prioritizing them. However if you haven't hit level 64 yet, make sure you select the Sigil of Nullification as your level up reward when you do. That's a sigil with some actual value. 
---
2). Once you hit level 14 you will unlock map completion, with this it will show you a small box in the upper left hand corner when you open your map. When you're on a certain map it will show you your progress in unlocking everything on the map. Doing 100% map completion is necessary for crafting legendaries and it gives you a chance at Black Lion chest keys, but it is absolutely not necessary for normal gameplay. My recommendation is to make sure you have all the waypoints and hero points completed on a map before moving on. 
---
If you feel you're still missing a lot and aren't sure how to get it, you can always download TaCo and Tekkit markers for map complete and follow along. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quKSP6hdqFo) should get you started if you go this route. 
---
3).  [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/List\_of\_basic\_chests](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/List_of_basic_chests) 
---
4). Once you're level 80 and want to either make ascended gear or gear with stats that can be obtained by crafting, then yes it's worth it. But it's not something I'd worry about until you're ready for that. And once you are you can [follow the guides on this site](https://gw2crafts.net/) to make it a little easier. 
---
5). Map completion to get BLC keys. They took the makeover kits out as a random drop but every chest has statuettes that drop, you can use those at a BL vendor to buy a kit for 10 statuettes (aka you would need 10 keys assuming you only get the guaranteed drop).
---
6). I.. don't think so? Sorry I don't have a better answer than this but I honestly don't think there's anything that isn't repeatable, at least that doesn't make it explicitly clear before finishing.
---
dude ... you dont know there is a thing called gear templates and we only getting 2 per character? And that is a problem as they will be sold separately and will be more expansive then build templates, as this is their scam. They are giving 3 free build templates but only 2 gear templates? they forcing you to get 1 more of gear templetes to even use your free 3 build templates. And dont tell me you can use 2 build with same gear, as situation like this would not require build templates at all as changing traits was fast already.
---
The problem is, they're taking a long requested QoL feature (that was available in their previous game for free) and selling it back to people.
---
No one likes content being cut and resold to them for an additional fee.
---
Thank you very much for this thorough explanation: I get it now!
---
You're not paying for a downgrade because Arcdps was always against ToS.  You're simply no longer able to continue performing actions that would normally be bannable.
---
Main DH at most xD  
---
Because main guardian means DH,Firebrand DPS, quickbrand, healbrand, power quickbrand (even if not much used) and then a wvw build at least, if you wvw xD... which means also 1 set power, 1 condi, 1 healer and at least 2 different sets of runes and sigils to swap between the quickbrand and firebrand dps xD
---
You get some free slots of amazing QoL but they need to make money somehow so they monetize extra slots. Just like bags, just like bank, THE AUDACITY
---
THIS! This is what I wanted and more! \*rolls in delight\*
---
Don’t know why people downvote you, but i agree.
---
the gold/gem conversion makes the templates only beeing able on the gemstone less impactful.
---
same could be said about mesmers.
---
Pulling the victim card again, classic anet.
---
What are build templates.
---
&gt; while taking away the unsupported 3rd party hack.
---
A "hack" that was only necessary because it took ArenaNet 7 years to implement a basic feature such as build templates.
---
https://i.imgflip.com/3c2m8g.jpg
---
I have and it's the same thing there, a group moves up, bates the fields, then either goes around them or waits them out of pushes through them.
---
Choke points are part of the game made, and theres always dodge roll.
---
Takes more time but I can use it on other chars too. as I understood is that if I use my legendaries to the gear templates I can only use it on one char instead of all.
---
Gotta git muh dailies
---
So you are mad at people telling the truth?   
---
Both of these features should have been in the game before it even released.
---
Zero dollars is the only acceptable price for a feature THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE AT LAUNCH
---
If he breaks his agreement on that, Anet might well ban the entire thing.
---
Just another indicator that as a whole they don't care about content, only money. And while sure it may be a bonus for those who did not, it is a slap in the face for the ones that did and have supported them for years. Build templates have been in the game for years and have worked amazingly well, and now all of a sudden they want to hop in and monetize it? Fuck outta here with that. It took then 7 years to put something in that should have been implemented day one, as a sequel you would think important QOL functions would be implemented to the next game, but apparently I'm giving too much credit
---
You've never touched Chrono, I see.
---
From a gameplay standpoint, it seems as though Flame will maintain some kind of existing identity, although what changes that identity will take on are hard to say.
---
While the Roleplaying aspect of this is somewhat irrelevant, I've been imagining what efforts some of the various Legions are putting-in to facilitate outreach to Flame.
---
I've got a Flame-blooded, Iron-raised elementalist who's been 'ordered' to act as a Primus, for the time being, to use his "unique" experiences (growing up a mage in Iron, not always easy one could imagine...especially with a Flame slave dam) to help integrate the mage cubs into more useful and constructive ideologies.
---
Essentially, I think Iron Legion will at the *very* least be thinking "Oh sweet, look at all these magic cubs that can help run the forges!"
---
Just because my account is 4 years old doesn't mean this game didn't exist to me prior to that. My best friend and his brother were GW1 veterans, so I had my eye on this game since way before it was even released, but nice try with your assumptions, bud. 
---
Yes I realize that, but I also realize that arcdps, while it was going to be free anyway, was forced to be free because Anet would have cracked down on it if it were a paid service. I also realize Anet themselves allowed it to be made, which I also realize was a mistake given how ungrateful the community is that they were allowed to even have a free iteration of it for as long as you did. When you consider the 3rd party app had no possibility to be a paid service, and was always going to be shut down when Anet added it to the game (implying that they were going to add it eventually), you have to expect this coming from a mile away. Look at everything else that is monetized in this game...and you're surprised? For someone who wants to flex on talking about since beta, you sure are clueless when it comes to Anet's monetization practices. Do you seriously think that because an app that couldn't possibly be monetized was free for years, and that justifies it being free on the game? Lmao. That's wild.
---
It is still a buff to you because you're still getting a little over 30 slots of inventory space for free from the start, per character...that's what I am mostly focusing on because I see no reason at all to bitch about having to take less than a minute of your time to manually change builds. How you can consider that a net loss is beyond me lol. I don't care if you have like up to 20 builds on a character, I have a shitty memory and I can still memorize builds because of how simple they are in this game. You can actually just preset a bunch of builds according to what type of content you want to do.Of all the things in the world you're gonna let trigger you, that's what you're gonna let win over your mental? Incredible. It's 2019. GW1 might have had free templates but that was in an entirely different era in gaming. Anything that can be monetized will be monetized these days, and you can point the finger at specific devs calling them greedy and shit but at the end of the day pretty much everyone is doing this kind of shit now. If you aren't desensitized to it by now, I have bad news for you because it's only going to get worse because people keep buying the shit anyway.
---
When did anet get you addicted to a substance that will physically kill you?
---
what you have and what you need are two different things. 
---
If you want to save everything across all accounts so that the player has access to those things from anywhere (like switching computers etc) then you would need to save that somewhere and that would be good to have in a database. But you don't "need" to do it that way if certain situations or design decisions are being decided upon.
---
For example, in GW1 you had to manage your own "database" of build templates, you could load them from your computer but had to name and organize them on your own. The game only did load and convert them but nothing more.
---
I actually would have expected it to work similar in GW2 which might not be completely "possible" since you can't share equipment templates.
---
Changing builds takes like 30 seconds tops. This is a purely convenience item to save that amount of time each time you change specs. It really isn't that big of a deal.
---
Fair enough. And fwiw, I agree that if there was a *required* sub fee the content output currently isn't high enough to warrant that. 
---
I guess I don't see how additional templates slots are different from character slots, bag slots, bank tabs, etc. Again they're locking extra convenience behind a paywall. It's completely in line with their business model since basically launch. I get that people don't like it, but it's pretty consistent with what the game has always been. 
---
But at the end of the day, they're trying to figure out where their income is going to come from. The last required purchase for GW2 players was in September of 2017 (PoF Launch), and there's no required purchases on the horizon in at least the next year. It's why I brought up the concept of subscription fees, not that I think it would work for GW2, but the challenge of how best to monetize an mmo in lieu of a sub fee is interesting. 
---
Thanks for the discussion!
---
You use the word "tolerated" like anet was unhappy with it. You didn't fix anything with your post, you are deliberately misleading anets intentions. 
---
There FTFY!
---
This
---
Yeah, that be fine as well. :) 
---
I just tried to not invalidate transmutation charges and the like with my suggestion; and still provide a way for arenanet to monetize it, should they choose too.
---
3 Free Build Templates.
---
2 Free Equipment Templates.
---
You know, so you -have- to buy more if you want things to be equal right off the bat.
---
We've had templates for a couple years now. Not sure if you have a full set of legendary gear and are used to swapping all that but it's not fun.
---
Just because you reference a build from snowcrows, doesn't mean you know how to play it properly.
---
You think so? Never really read up on it, but there are a lot of things hinting at something else. I mean, we have the Astralarium in Istan and pretty much half of Canthan society relates to star constellations and what they mean to the people. If it really was just Chaos out there, they wouldn't bother with any of this.
---
Yeah, better pay a box + monthly free and 4 buck per month if you want the extra retainers because the inventory is abysmal :v They totally do not want to hog your money just like any company out there.
---
That's the exact reason people are annoyed about this. To a lot of people, templates are important functionality, not cosmetic. So monetizing them is extra irritating.
---
i agree that the game is a team game, absolutely.  Necro's depend on their teammates in comp modes because of their inherent weaknesses.  My OP issue is that scourge has only had nerfs since it came out and is now getting another nerf making a weak class even weaker.
---
While comp modes dont expect you to 1v1, there is a lof of 1v1 in spvp with side nodding.  And in high level pve content while you have a healer and tank dps is basically 1v1 because your doing your damage to a single target.
---
No farts? guess it needs more pepper.
---
also a gearcheck option: pay 200 gems per gearcheck :D
---
*"Forsaken Swordshame 1332:  A Flame Imperator you can trust!
---
'*
---
Imagine wanting to pay for text files.
---
Sometimes I wonder how many games people with such an opinion played in their lives. What even is this worldview and relationship with money.
---
"I want Build templates even if i have to pay for it"  
---
\*Anet makes you pay for it\*  
---
"That's bs, Anet mercenary"
---
I have full leg armor and some trinkets, it's a pain but it beats carrying around 5 sets of armor.  Templates have been unofficial and dont always work.  An official option with this level of integration is really nice.
---
This is good enough and you have no idea if was even possible to be implemented from the beginning. So, no I am not mad about people telling the truth because their 'truth' is purely opinion based in the case of "Not good enough" and purely conjuncture in the case of "You should have added this earlier."
---
Wait you can't use the old mod?
---
*prices apply per log, log parser sold separately
---
Ain't you a merry one.
---
Can you just not...
---
You can always create new characters. I got 4 different warriors for example: Berserker condi BS, berserker power BS, vanilla power BS and pure DPS berserker. All have their own full set of ascended gear and weapons.
---
That’s what large parts of video games are my friend. Don’t disrespect the coders
---
This is why Anet is charging. There are people who think a singular template is worth 5 dollars, and say people "claim" to need 6 or 7 like this is somehow an impossible goal to meet.
---
I personally have no issue with templates being on the gemstore. I have an issue with the tiny amount of templates that we start with and that the max amount of (equipment) templates doesn't seem to be that many either.
---
Word is arc templates were only allowed until ANET released their system.  After launch, arc will remove their implementation.
---
META DUMB ME SMART
---
It's actually a bit predatory in the sense that they stood on stage and called out "free quality of life updates", and showcased build templates only for them to actually be extremely restrictive unless you pay.
---
When they figure out a way to monetize them.
---
Mounts pay for maps, outfits pay for armors, material storage upgrades pay for meta event farms, and so on.
---
pls dont give them ideas. Wait, they don't read the feedback anyways. Nevermind. Vent your anger.
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
When they add dps meter they can also add dps boost primers. Your dps will appear higher for 12h based on how much gems you spend.
---
200 gems - 20% higher dps.
---
400 gems - 50% higher dps.
---
700 gems - 100% higher dps.
---
Note that it doesn't increase your actual dps, it just increases the number in dps meter.
---
People are not overreacting at all.
---
Imagine believing this.
---
no OP just niche.  Necro's excel in group scenarios and lack in single target times. they need to be babysat in comp modes and have no activatable defense outside of barrier which is flimsy at best since it just goes away.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dbhj8j/build_templates_coming_next_month/f220ib2/
---
How can the same reddit that demands free mount SKINS every other week be okay with the fact that people are now being asked to pay for putting in effort in build variety? I (and i'm pretty sure everyone else) was fully aware that gemstore upgrades were to be included in build templates BUT for one i was expecting it to at least cover a reasonable amount by default (that being power/condi/support, aka 3 gear slots) and even more so I am not willing to pay extra for a feature (storing gear in gear templates) that has no use once you acquired legendary gear.
---
So you'll just not use the free ones then out of spite?
---
You have limited slots so there's no reason to save a build that you don't plan to use, especially if those slots are shared on multiple chars.
---
Did you know that other games included logs for FREE in their game!!!!!!
---
Arcdps templates will be, as per the agreement between Anet and Deltaconnected, not be supported and very likely not work at all anymore.
---
One per character. Create character -&gt; set it up -&gt; never touch equipment, traits or skills unless balance update forces to.
---
thats the game mode.  WvW group play is all about getting hit by more than 5 people at a time and getting wrecked if out of position and using the terrain to your advantage.
---
it would be like if 1 warrior could run into a group of 20 people and remove all thier boons and then run out with extra evades, leaps, charges, blocks, stab, and resistance ...... oh wait they can do that and do lots of damage
---
You must admit that for gw1, it's only about PvP armors and PvE/PvP builds. The management of armors in PvE was horrible (my zaishen bag with 25 slots of armor/weapons for optimization/fashion reasons)
---
But here, my main problem will be armor management as well: not about space inventory, but more the speed to switch gear (using legendary already solved the first problem). Paying for template because it grants me bag slots is not really worth it IMHO
---
well I can understand it.  This isn't a vanity item that one should HAVe to pay for.,its a QoL item and should have been included with the client right from the get go.  Since when do we pay for QoL items?

&gt; # **10/01/2019—October 1 Release Notes**
---
&gt;
---
&gt;## **World Polish**
---
&gt;- Optional dialogue in the chapter Coming Home now appears in the chat log.
---
&gt;- Seimur Oxbone will now provide chef vendor services in the home instances of players who have unlocked the Gourmet Training collection.
---
&gt;- Fixed a bug that destroyed ascended herbs growing in players&amp;#39; home instance gardens after they harvested nodes in the same location in another player&amp;#39;s garden.
---
&gt;- Fixed a bug that caused repaired Brand Stompers in Grothmar Valley to still appear as broken after players left and returned to the map before completing the entire collection.
---
&gt;- It is now possible for players to complete the Khan-Ur&amp;#39;s Right Hand achievement if they have already looted the chest in the same day. Progress is now granted upon approaching the final chest with the required conditions met.
---
&gt;- Maximum scaling has been adjusted for several microevents during A Concert for the Ages. This generally increases difficulty, but it also gives more opportunity for participation.
---
&gt;  - The events most affected are the &amp;quot;Repair the faulty wires!&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Stop the amp from blowing!&amp;quot; events.
---
&gt;  - Leaps occur faster in the &amp;quot;Catch the leaping charr!&amp;quot; event to increase difficulty.
---
&gt;  - Pyrotorrick can now pick up more people because not enough players were getting chucked.
---
&gt;  - The cooldown between shots has been reduced for launching fireworks in the &amp;quot;Hit the firework targets!&amp;quot; event.
---
&gt;- Transitions between hype tiers in A Concert for the Ages now adjust by the appropriate value for the completed/failed event instead of a set transition value.
---
&gt;- The public version of Strike Mission: Shiverpeaks Pass now requires at least 5 players to be in the map before they can progress forward.
---
&gt;## **General**
---
&gt;- Added a checkbox to the Customize window for equipped items to apply the currently displayed stats and legendary rune choices to all valid items.
---
&gt;  - Valid items for stats are equipped legendary items, separated into groups of armor, weapons, and trinkets.
---
&gt;  - Valid items for legendary rune choices are legendary runes slotted in equipped armor.
---
&gt;- Text searches in the Customize window now search all displayed text in list view.
---
&gt;## **Items**
---
&gt;- Casino Coins: A Consume All option has been added to this item.
---
&gt;- Spirit Banner: Fixed a visual bug with this banner that displayed all potential effects rather than the three being granted.
---
&gt;## **Profession Skills**
---
&gt;### General
---
&gt;When we originally created the alacrity and barrier effects, they were intended to be profession specific, but we&amp;#39;ve changed this stance after seeing how the game changed and evolved over time. While the original effects were visually iconic to their initial professions, it was a good time to update them with a look that could fit any profession.
---
&gt;- Barrier: Updated the visual effects of this effect to be less profession specific.
---
&gt;- Alacrity: Updated the visual effects of this effect to be less profession specific.
---
&gt;- Special Forces Training Area: Conditions on the Preview Holo-Golem will no longer be removed by player skills.
---
&gt;- Low-Health Traits: Updated traits that activate when the user drops below a specified health threshold so that they behave more consistently.
---
&gt;### Items
---
&gt;- Superior Rune of Antitoxin: This rune no longer removes additional conditions from allies cleansed by the player. Instead, it removes an additional condition from the player whenever a condition is removed from the player.
---
&gt;### Elementalist
---
&gt;In this update, we&amp;#39;re following up on some of the tempest changes from the previous update. Speedy Conduit has been a lackluster trait for a while, so we&amp;#39;re combining it with Harmonious Conduit and creating a new trait that grants concentration. Imbued Melodies is being removed—we felt it wasn&amp;#39;t very interesting while also being unnecessarily restrictive by being tied to the warhorn. Its replacement, Transcendent Tempest, provides an effect that is unique among other grandmaster traits, which we hope will provide a more meaningful choice when compared to the other options.
---
&gt;- Signet of Air: This skill can now be activated to break stuns without a target. Activating the skill while out of range of a target or without a target while not under control effects will put it on interrupt cooldown.
---
&gt;- Glyph of Renewal (Renewal of Fire): Reduced the amount of invulnerability granted when reviving the elementalist from 5 seconds to 1 second.
---
&gt;- Burning Rage: Reduced the burning duration from 5 seconds to 4 seconds.
---
&gt;- Speedy Conduit: This trait has been removed. Its functionality has been combined with Harmonious Conduit, and it has been replaced with Gathered Focus.
---
&gt;- Gathered Focus: This new trait takes the master tier, minor trait slot, and it grants 120 concentration plus an additional 120 concentration while the elementalist is above 90% health.
---
&gt;- Harmonious Conduit: This trait no longer increases damage after completing an overload. Instead it grants swiftness in addition to stability. It has also changed positions with Invigorating Torrents.
---
&gt;- Invigorating Torrents: This trait has switched positions with Harmonious Conduit. Its functionality is unchanged.
---
&gt;- Imbued Melodies: This trait has been reworked, and its name has been changed to Transcendent Tempest. This trait reduces the time it takes to attain a singularity by 33% when switching elements and increases outgoing damage and condition damage by 7% for 7 seconds after an overload completes.
---
&gt;### Engineer
---
&gt;When the scrapper&amp;#39;s profession ability was changed to an F5 skill, the tool belt skill from Sneak Gyro, Detection Pulse, was replaced. That skill was sorely missed as it provided useful and skilled counterplay if well timed. As the profession mechanic needed to remain on the F5 key, we looked elsewhere and saw that Purge Gyro, an inherently defensive and utility-centric ability, had a tool belt skill that did not fit its intent. Scrapper is also getting a bit of a tune-up with its hammer skills and a reduction to the vitality loss of the Impact Savant trait, which was leaving them a bit squishier than we intended for a bruiser style of play.
---
&gt;- Equalizing Blow: Increased damage by 9%.
---
&gt;- Electro Whirl: Increased damage by 9%.
---
&gt;- Rocket Charge: Increased damage by 10%.
---

---

---
&gt;- Holographic Shockwave: Reduced range from 600 to 300.
---
&gt;- Function Gyro: Increased damage by 100%. Increased land radius to 240 and underwater radius to 360. Added clarification to skill description to clarify that function gyros are destroyed when their skill is interrupted. Reduced recharge from 30 seconds to 25 seconds.
---
&gt;- Shaped Charge: This trait now increases damage by 0.5% per stack of vulnerability instead of by a flat amount.
---
&gt;- Solar Focusing Lens: This trait now also grants 2 stacks of Afterburner when deactivating photon forge. Increased stacks granted from overheating from 5 to 6.
---
&gt;- Chemical Field: This skill has been replaced by Detection Pulse as the tool belt skill for Purge Gyro.
---
&gt;- Detection Pulse: This skill replaces Purge Gyro&amp;#39;s previous tool belt skill, Chemical Field. The radius of this skill has been reduced from 1200 to 900, and its targeting has been improved in large group settings.
---
&gt;- Purge Gyro: The tool belt skill for Purge Gyro has changed from Chemical Field to Detection Pulse.
---
&gt;- Sneak Gyro: Increased the cooldown of this skill from 45 to 60 seconds in WvW.
---
&gt;- Med Kit: This kit can now be used underwater.
---
&gt;- Med Blaster (Med Kit): Increased healing to match tooltip.
---
&gt;- Cleansing Field (Med Kit): Fixed a bug that caused this skill to remove more conditions than intended.
---
&gt;- Elixir U: Fixed a bug that could cause this skill to give endurance.
---
&gt;- Supply Crate: Fixed a bug in which the Healing Turret created from this skill would not overcharge.
---
&gt;- Health Insurance: Updated description and tooltips to accurately reflect the functionality of this trait. This trait increases incoming healing by 10% and increases outgoing healing by 20% while using Med Kit.
---
&gt;- Mechanized Deployment: Fixed a bug that caused this trait to grant less than the listed 15% recharge reduction.
---
&gt;- Mass Momentum: Increased stability duration from 3 seconds to 5 seconds.
---
&gt;- Impact Savant: Reduced the vitality loss from this trait from 300 to 180.
---
&gt;### Guardian
---
&gt;Firebrand prevalence in group content has been quite strong as they offer significant support options to the point that they were crowding out other builds. In particular, Tome of Courage had a bit more power than was healthy, so we&amp;#39;ve sought to tweak that down while retaining its overall playstyle by removing some of its boon generation. We&amp;#39;re also reducing scepter damage and increasing sword damage in PvE as the best melee damage option should not be a ranged weapon.
---
&gt;- Orb of Wrath: Reduced damage by 10% in PvE only.
---
&gt;- Symbol of Blades: Removed the double strike that occurs when the symbol is first created. Increased damage of each strike by 20% to compensate. Overall damage is unchanged.
---
&gt;- Zealot&amp;#39;s Defense: Increased PvE damage by 20%.

---

---
&gt;- Sanctuary: Increased number of enemies that can be knocked back by this skill before it expires from 10 to 20. Decreased duration from 6 seconds to 5 seconds. Decreased recharge from 75 seconds to 60 seconds.
---
&gt;- Tome of Resolve—Chapter 2: Radiant Recovery: The existing split of cleansing 2 conditions in PvP has been brought to WvW as well. This skill continues to cleanse 3 conditions in PvE.
---
&gt;- Tome of Courage—Chapter 2: Daring Challenge: This skill now grants retaliation for 3 seconds instead of aegis.
---
&gt;- Tome of Courage—Epilogue: Unbroken Lines: This skill no longer grants retaliation. The existing split of a 15-second cooldown in PvP has been brought to WvW as well. This skill retains a 12-second cooldown in PvE.
---
&gt;- Purging Flames: This skill no longer reduces the duration of incoming conditions. Instead of removing 3 conditions from allies when cast, it now removes 1 condition from allies and 1 additional condition every second the skill persists. Fixed a bug that prevented this skill from being properly extended when Master of Consecrations was equipped.
---
&gt;- Eternal Armory: Changed burning from 2 stacks for 2 seconds to 1 stack for 4 seconds.
---
&gt;- Stoic Demeanor: This trait now inflicts burning for 5 seconds in addition to inflicting slow. Reduced the internal cooldown from 5 seconds to 3 seconds. Cooldown is now determined per target instead of globally.
---
&gt;### Mesmer
---
&gt;Chaotic Interruption has been reworked as a trait that offers a dynamic and skillful form of play by giving savvy players a means to use their abilities to recharge weapon skills. Some chronomancer tweaks are also in to offer another means of granting group quickness and to clean up some functional redundancy between Delayed Reactions and Lost Time.
---
&gt;- Illusion of Life: Reduced the amount of time a resurrected ally is invulnerable from 5 seconds to 1 second. This skill should now target more effectively in group situations.
---
&gt;- Power Spike (Mantra of Pain): This skill now requires mesmers to face their target and respects line of sight.
---
&gt;- Power Lock (Mantra of Distraction): This skill now requires mesmers to face their target and respects line of sight.

&gt;- Chaotic Interruption: This trait has been reworked. When interrupting a foe, it now recharges one of your currently recharging equipped weapon skills by 5 seconds. This trait has a 1-second internal cooldown.
---
&gt;- Delayed Reactions: This trait no longer grants alacrity but now triggers on any control effect rather than only on interrupts. Added a 3-second cooldown per target.
---

---
&gt;- Seize the Moment: This trait now applies quickness in a 240 area-of-effect radius around the mesmer and can hit 5 targets (including the mesmer).
---
&gt;### Necromancer
---
&gt;The Death Magic specialization has had a significant rework this update, revolving around a new effect and various means of gaining additional defense while bringing together a more cohesive set of playstyles. The scourge elite specialization has also undergone a significant change such that its shade skills will only fire around them when they do NOT have a shade up. If they do have a shade present, then those skills will happen around their summoned sand shades. Alongside this change, the scourge and each sand shade now affect an increased number of targets by default, which can be increased further through the use of the grandmaster trait Sand Savant. This change leans into the dependence a scourge has on their unique elite specialization mechanic, shades, and opens up the specialization to future potential improvements across its kit. This change creates a choice between whether scourges expose themselves to some melee risk but charge in to affect foes around them, or whether they hang back and summon a shade near their foe and are unable to affect themselves with shade abilities (unless they also place one on their own location). We&amp;#39;ll be keeping a close eye on the results of this change and making adjustments accordingly.
---
&gt;- Scourge: Shade skills no longer affect the area around the scourge while they have a shade present in the world. Increased the number of targets affected by shade skills from 3 to 5.
---
&gt;- Manifest Sand Shade: The duration of sand shades in WvW and PvP has been increased from 10 seconds to 15 seconds.
---
&gt;- Minion Summoning Skills: Fixed a bug that could allow minions to persist after the skill was unequipped.
---
&gt;- Oppressive Collapse: This skill now requires line of sight.
---
&gt;- Feast of Corruption: Reduced damage by 20% in PvP and WvW. The existing split of corrupting 2 boons in PvP has been brought to WvW as well. This skill continues to corrupt 3 boons in PvE. This skill now queues behind other skills rather than interrupting them.
---
&gt;- Devouring Darkness: Reduced damage by 20% in PvP and WvW. The existing split of corrupting 2 boons in PvP has been brought to WvW as well. This skill continues to corrupt 3 boons in PvE. This skill now queues behind other skills rather than interrupting them.
---
&gt;- Grasping Darkness: Fixed an issue that could cause the claw effect to pop out of existence before the skill completed. Removed misleading legendary projectile effects from this skill due to it not being a projectile.
---
&gt;- Blood Bond: Fixed a bug that caused this trait to heal the necromancer when it activated.
---
&gt;- Sand Savant: Increased the number of targets affected by the larger shade from 2 to 5 so that it now affects up to 10 targets.
---
&gt;- Death Magic: This trait line has been reworked. Many traits now revolve around a new effect called Death&amp;#39;s Carapace that increases toughness by 20 for each stack up to a maximum of 30 stacks. Death&amp;#39;s Carapace stacks are applied for 10 seconds from all traits except Flesh of the Master.
---
&gt;  - Minor:
---
&gt;      - Armored Shroud: This trait now gives 5 stacks of Death&amp;#39;s Carapace when entering shroud.
---
&gt;      - Soul Comprehension: In addition to its previous effects, this trait now also grants 1 stack of Death&amp;#39;s Carapace for each kill the necromancer participates in.
---
&gt;      - Beyond the Veil: This trait has been reworked. It now reduces condition damage by 10% while the necromancer has at least 10 stacks of Death&amp;#39;s Carapace.
---
&gt;  - Adept:
---
&gt;      - Flesh of the Master: Instead of granting armor for each minion, this trait now causes the necromancer&amp;#39;s minions to grant them 2 Death&amp;#39;s Carapace stacks as long as the minions are alive.
---
&gt;      - Putrid Defense: This trait has changed positions and its functionality has changed. It now causes poison to deal 15% more damage and grants 1 Death&amp;#39;s Carapace stack when applying poison.
---
&gt;      - Shrouded Removal: This trait has changed positions. In addition to its previous effects, it now grants 3 Death&amp;#39;s Carapace stacks when a condition is removed.
---
&gt;  - Master:
---
&gt;      - Necromantic Corruption: This trait is unchanged.
---
&gt;      - Dark Defiance: This trait is unchanged.
---
&gt;      - Deadly Strength: This trait has been reworked. It now causes Death&amp;#39;s Carapace to grant an additional 10 power per stack.

---
&gt;      - Death Nova: Updated skill facts and description. Updated attack name from Lesser Poison Cloud to Poison Nova in order to indicate that it has different behavior from Corrosive Poison Cloud.

Fixed various issues that caused this trait to behave inconsistently with certain minions. Increased damage by 60% in PvE only.
---
&gt;      - Corrupter&amp;#39;s Fervor: This trait has been reworked. It now grants 1 Death&amp;#39;s Carapace stack when applying any condition. Additionally, at 25 Death&amp;#39;s Carapace stacks or above, the necromancer gains pulsing protection for 3 seconds every 3 seconds.
---
&gt;      - Unholy Sanctuary: This trait is unchanged.
---
&gt;### Ranger
---
&gt;In this update, we&amp;#39;re making a major change to sword skills in order to better improve their flow during combat. Monarch&amp;#39;s Leap, Hornet Sting, and Serpent&amp;#39;s Strike are all shuffling around into new slots, which should make the weapon a little easier to understand. We&amp;#39;re also including some enhancements for the off-hand dagger, which has been a pretty weak weapon that hasn&amp;#39;t kept up with the pace of the game very well. Finally, we&amp;#39;re simplifying the greatsword&amp;#39;s Counterattack skill and taking some power out of the chain-attack sequence. We hope these changes will make the weapon feel a little smoother while removing some of the frustrating random dodges that happen when fighting against it.
---
&gt;- Long Range Shot: Reduced the minimum damage of this skill by 14% and the maximum damage by 11% in WvW only.
---
&gt;- Sword Chain-Attack Sequence: Updated icons for Crippling Thrust and Precision Swipe.
---
&gt;- Stalker&amp;#39;s Strike: Base damage of this attack has been increased by 200%. This attack now deals double damage and inflicts 2 additional poison stacks if it strikes a foe with a movement-impairing condition.
---
&gt;- Crippling Talon: This skill now uses the ammunition system and has 2 ammo with a 15-second count recharge time and a 1-second recharge between uses. Reduced cripple duration from 6 seconds to 4 seconds. Reduced bleeding duration from 8 seconds to 6 seconds.
---
Scourges
---
&gt; excel in group scenarios
---
are game-breakingly overpowered in group scenarios
---
&gt; lack in single target
---
are boring and underwhelming in single target
---
&gt;- Hornet Sting: This sword skill has moved to weapon slot 3. It now recharges Monarch&amp;#39;s Leap if it hits. Its recharge has been increased from 8 seconds to 15 seconds.
---
&gt;- Monarch&amp;#39;s Leap: This sword skill is now the primary skill in weapon slot 2. Using this skill flips it over to Serpent&amp;#39;s Strike for 5 seconds. It now has an 8-second recharge.
---
&gt;- Serpent&amp;#39;s Strike: This skill is now the follow-up skill to Monarch&amp;#39;s Leap. It no longer has a recharge.
---
&gt;- Swoop: Fixed an issue that prevented the casting bar for this skill from matching the actual casting time of the dash.
---
&gt;- Counterattack: Removed the Crippling Throw follow-up skill. This skill no longer automatically uses Counterattack Kick when blocking a foe within the range threshold. Instead, blocking any attack flips the skill to Counterattack Kick for 5 seconds. Increased the number of targets for Counterattack Kick from 1 to 3. Counterattack Kick now evades for its duration and activates faster.
---
&gt;- Power Stab: This skill no longer evades for its duration. Its name has been changed to Enduring Swing. This skill now grants 15 endurance if it hits.
---
&gt;- Quick Draw: Fixed a bug that prevented this trait from reducing recharge time.
---
&gt;### Revenant
---
&gt;In addition to some changes to Coalescence of Ruin and Gaze of Darkness aimed at WvW play, we are also tuning up a few of Mallyx&amp;#39;s Legendary Demon Stance skills from the last update as we felt they ended up on the weak side. Jalis&amp;#39;s Legendary Dwarf Stance skills are also seeing some improvements aimed at making them more powerful and easier to use to better warrant the use of your energy.
---
&gt;- Coalescence of Ruin: This skill no longer deals increased damage with successive impacts; it now always deals damage equal to what was previously the second-impact damage. Its damage remains split between game modes. Added a red warning rectangle visible to enemies.
---
&gt;- Embrace the Darkness: Lowered the recharge from 10 seconds to 3 seconds.
---
&gt;- Gaze of Darkness: This skill now reveals stealth enemies up to a range of 600, inflicting blindness and vulnerability.
---
&gt;- True Nature (Assassin): Reduced radius from 600 to 360.
---
&gt;- Call to Anguish: Decreased energy cost from 35 to 30. Reduced recharge from 5 seconds to 3 seconds. Increased radius from 240 to 360. Damage increased by 33%.

---
&gt;- Focused Siphoning: Increased base healing by 88% in PvE.
---
&gt;- Elder&amp;#39;s Respite: Added a 10-second internal cooldown to this trait.
---
&gt;### Thief
---
&gt;The previous Shadow Arts update landed pretty well overall, but we think that the siphons ended up a little weak. We&amp;#39;re tuning these up a bit, as well as touching up a few other traits that didn&amp;#39;t feel quite right. In addition to these changes, we&amp;#39;re updating Improvisation to recharge a random utility skill on the skill bar rather than a random utility skill type. This change is intended to lower the variance on the trait and to allow for more flexibility in utility selection. Finally, stolen bundles now use the ammo system in order to help with readability.
---
&gt;- Steal: Fixed a bug that could cause the shadowstep to fail in rare situations.
---
&gt;- Swipe: Fixed a bug that could cause the shadowstep to fail in rare situations. Reduced recharge from 30 seconds to 25 seconds.
---
&gt;- Hidden Thief: Fixed a bug that could cause this trait to activate even if Steal failed.
---
&gt;- Leeching Venoms: This trait now immediately grants a stack of spider venom when the thief first enters stealth and every 3 seconds after.
---
&gt;- Improvisation: Instead of recharging an entire skill category at random, this trait now recharges one of your equipped utility skills at random.
---
&gt;- Stolen Bundles: Stolen bundles now show their number of uses as ammunition.
---
&gt;- Shadow Siphoning: Increased base healing by 62%.
---
&gt;- Cloaked in Shadow: Increased base damage and the damage multiplier by 100%. Increased base healing by 100% and the heal multiplier by 60%.
---
&gt;- Lead Attacks: Fixed a bug that caused this trait to grant less than the listed 15% recharge reduction.
---
&gt;### Warrior
---
&gt;In this update, we&amp;#39;re focusing on changes to the Tactics trait line and warhorn skills. We&amp;#39;ve removed the traits related to reviving allies in order to make room for new traits and improvements to old traits that focus more on ways warriors can affect allies while they are still in the fight. The new Tactics traits are focused around empowering allies through boons and effects, helping allies who are taking a beating, and a selection of warrior-enhancing battlefield strategies.
---
&gt;- Charge: The icon for this skill has been updated. This skill now only removes movement-impairing conditions. It now increases the damage of affected allies&amp;#39; next 2 attacks by 25% (10% in WvW) for 8 seconds in addition to its previous effects. Increased swiftness duration from 10 seconds to 15 seconds. This skill is now a blast finisher.
---
&gt;- Call to Arms: This skill has been renamed Call of Valor, and its functionality has changed. Removed an unnecessary unblockable skill fact. This skill now removes 3 conditions from affected allies instead of specific conditions. It also now applies barrier in addition to vigor.
---
&gt;- Sight beyond Sight: Increased the radius of this skill to reveal stealth enemies within a radius of 600.
---
&gt;- Burning Arrows: This trait has been removed, and its effects have been merged with Crack Shot in the Discipline line.
---
&gt;- Crack Shot: Instead of granting bonus adrenaline for base harpoon gun shots, this trait now adds 3 seconds of bleeding to each shot.
---
&gt;- Tactics: The Tactics line has been reworked. Several traits in this line now revolve around a new effect called Soldier&amp;#39;s Focus, which grants bonuses when executing bursts.
---
&gt;      - Marching Orders: This new trait grants the Soldier&amp;#39;s Focus effect every 15 seconds. This effect is expended when hitting with a burst to grant 3 stacks of might for 15 seconds to allies within a range of 300.
---
&gt;      - Empowered: Moved from the adept tier. The effects are unchanged.
---
&gt;      - Mending Might: Applying might to an ally heals the warrior.
---
&gt;      - Leg Specialist: In addition to its previous effects, this trait now also grants a 7% damage bonus against foes suffering from a movement-impairing condition. The cooldown on this trait is now calculated per target.
---
&gt;      - Soldier&amp;#39;s Comfort: This new trait heals nearby allies when Soldier&amp;#39;s Focus activates.
---
&gt;      - Roaring Reveille: This new trait increases the number of targets for warhorn skills from 5 to 10 and causes warhorn skills to grant an additional boon. It grants fury for Charge and resistance for Call to Arms. It also grants an additional 120 concentration.
---
&gt;      - Warrior&amp;#39;s Cunning: This new trait increases damage by 25% against foes with health above 90%. Additionally, it increases damage by 50% against foes that have barrier. These bonuses do not stack.
---
&gt;      - Shrug It Off: This trait has moved, and its icon has been updated. In addition to its previous effect, it also causes the warrior to heal allies when removing damaging conditions from them.
---
&gt;      - Empower Allies: In addition to its previous effects, this trait also increases the radius of Soldier&amp;#39;s Focus to 600. Added a missing number of targets skill fact.
---
&gt;      - Martial Cadence: This new trait causes Soldier&amp;#39;s Focus to reduce the warrior&amp;#39;s equipped weapon skill cooldowns by 3 seconds.
---
&gt;      - Vigorous Shouts: This trait no longer grants adrenaline when using shouts. Instead, it grants healing power equal to 13% of power.
---
&gt;      - Phalanx Strength: Increased might duration from 4 seconds to 5 seconds.
---
&gt;## **World vs. World**
---
&gt;- Warclaw: Added a new skill called Lance. The skill is obtained by training it in the warclaw Rank and Abilities line. The skill allows you to throw a lance at a target. If the target is a mounted player, it will dismount both you and the target if it hits.
---
&gt;## **BLACK LION TRADING COMPANY GEM STORE**

---
&gt;- Fixed an issue that caused the arms of the Mage Knight Outfit to appear stretched during certain emotes on female norn characters.
---
&gt;No one likes content being cut and resold to them for an additional fee.
---
I'm still salty the Tormented Weapons from GW1, THE most sought after and prestigious full set of skins, were brought back behind a loot box.
---
And of course all this only show a max. of 5k dps. Unlock your max shown dps to 10/15/20/.../45k for only 1000 gems per step.
---
&gt;Pushing and Healing
---
In most cases its the same, isnt?
---
&gt;Hand Kiting and Tanking
---
Works well with same build.
---
I have 9+ on my main alone and most other classes have 5-6
---
And build templates do not include the stats in your gear. That's the equipment templates, and they didn't say you could link those, which means they aren't really 'templates', but 'loadouts'.
---
What other reason is there not to like it? It is what people have been asking for. You got what you wanted, but have to pay for a little more. So if it isn't because of the money, than it is because you feel it isn't good enough. And that is completely subjective and no reason to argue over.
---
It takes a while but you can always earn gold and convert to gems. Its not like you absolutely have no choice but to use real money.
---
Realistically the equipment slots are what people are in a kerfluffle over the most. Pricing I would consider "fair" would probably be:
---
**Template storage slots** - $0. Put a cap on it of like 10 or something if server storage space is an issue. People can just copy codes to a text document, so it's not like the convenience factor is very high.
---
**Build Template Slots** - 1 unlocked immediately for free, one unlockable through in-game progress for each elite spec you've trained completely on a character, and additional ones purchasable as an account-wide unlock of +1 per character for 400 gems.
---
**Equipment Template Slots** - 2 for free immediately, purchasable as an account-wide unlock of +1 per character for 800 gems.
---
At least that's the optimist in me talking. Realistically we already know storage slots are going to cost extra, and nothing is going to be unlockable through gameplay.
---
&gt; I'd like to remind everyone that build templates were completely FREE in GW1 
---
Which words in 
---
"*two different games that share the lore world and huge amount of code*"
---
you don't understand? Are you fucking aware that these are away from each other by 7 years? And fucking MMORPG market changes as well? Not mention that there are far worse locked on features titles than GW2.
---
If you fucking believed that while having already upgrades for inventory bag slots, shared inventory slots, materials storage, bank tabs and character slots they won't monetize this, you were fucking deluded. Wanna complain about something then go complain on official forums about fact that in case of deleting a character, all character-alike upgrades are lost and not transferable. And go tell them that you want these upgrades for build templates being available for reasonable amount of gems.
---
The trait/util cap of 3 is redundant since you can circumvent that with chat codes. The offender is equipment templates. 2 for free? My mesmer has more than 10 gear variations in arc. Each of which is a pain in the ass to do manually. Even more concerning is that it seems that the equipment slots will be unlocked per char like bag slots and will be capped to six. Fml playing chrono in raids.
---
To prevent toxicity if you have lower dps. Other players cannot see if you are running the booster.
---
They officially approved its usage. Your argument is invalid.
---
Auto-loot is a mastery that used to be handled by add-ons before masteries where a thing (source: a guildie that played during that period, I started way after)
---
You pay for them yes.
---
Skins for the bar display.
---
Great. Now try it when you have 5-6 different full gears of ascended, including trinkets, under a pressure of raid group to not take too long to switch. 
---
It might only take minute or two, but that minute or two adds up and adding something into game thats behind huge paywall isnt fair.
---
You're running Mesmer main?
---
Yes!
---
&gt;Warclaw: Added a new skill called Lance. The skill is obtained by training it in the warclaw Rank and Abilities line. The skill allows you to throw a lance at a target. If the target is a mounted player, it will dismount both you and the target if it hits.
---
I'm going to enjoy this so much
---
Anet doesn't cater to veterans and this sub is full of veterans, what do you expect? Every single post from Season 4 onwards will be like this as they've given up implementing stuff that people on this sub want. 
---
I guess the majority of people in game don't give a shit, I doubt they even bother with multiple builds per character
---
It's free dude. You can't pretend that it isn't.
---
Ganker's paradise.
---
But would you need to be near a trainer to do that?
---
I know that GW1 had free unlimited copy/paste build templates and 4 hotkeyed weapon slots, but did it have full armor equipment templates? (I haven't played much of GW1 and honestly can't remember)
---
&gt;Added a checkbox to the Customize window for equipped items to apply the currently displayed stats and legendary rune choices to all valid items.
---
&gt;Valid items for stats are equipped legendary items, separated into groups of armor, weapons, and trinkets.
---
&gt;Valid items for legendary rune choices are legendary runes slotted in equipped armor.
---
If I read this correctly, it will please quite a few of us.
---
So they added jousting to WvW?
---
And every game mode needs one diferent meter, selled by gambling coupins or buying the full pack at double price.
---
Wahhhhhh
---
I just went and counted them, build/gear templates. Not counting weapon/sigilswaps. And I don't play wvw that much.
---
Necro 4/4
---
Ele: 6/12
---
Mesmer: 7/9
---
Engie: 4/4
---
Ranger: 6/9
---
Thief: 6/6
---
Warrior: 6/9
---
Guardian: 9/11
---
Revenant: 8/8
---
&gt; Be glad they decided not to ban your ass for using it.
---
Yeah that was what I said, genius.
---
This is one of those updates that cater casuals with one or two builds.. 
---
I am part of Raid guild, where I am doing multiple roles including chrono, cdps, pdps, separate builds for spotter/non-spotter builds + enjoying occasional WvW with some meme builds, full upgrade is going to cost me thousands of gems. 
---
They wont even let me keep my arcdps templates..
---
How is this not a low-effort post, mods?
---
That fixes quite a few things honestly
---
Warrior, although my mesmer probably has as many. I have a pve roaming build, pve meta build, 4-5 raid/ fractal builds and 3 wvw builds. I'm not including pop because from the sound of it pop is going to be separate for right now.
---
Again... ArcDPS was free. They had a clause with the developer to stop updating their templates once ArenaNet put out their own.
---
So even the base isn't really free. They're deprecating an *actually* free add-on to put out their own monetized feature.
---
The predatory element to this would be the 2 equipment slots vs 3 build slots imo. 
---
Low key, but still predatory design.
---
We really do need to thank these people more.
---
When arcDPS breaks after an update, the game really does feel weird. I have no idea how well am doing in any fight, from WvW to PvE. It's such an incredible tool for self improvement.
---
Taco just makes so many tasks braindead simple. From certain raid mechanics, to the most optimal route to gather something. So helpful for so many things around the world.
---
GW2 efficiency is so great for so many different things. From figuring out how to make the most money from selling a dungeon currency, to planning out what's the cheapest dye you don't own to finish the collection. It provides so much data and information about so many parts of the game, and while it's just a website, I use it almost every day I play the game. Even it's stats can be fun to read and compare with friends.
---
It's easy to forget that people just work on these for their own love of the game. Each of these tools improve the game in so many ways, and the amount of work gone into each of them is appreciated. After using them all, I can't imagine going back to a time without any of them. Thanks to all the people behind these projects, you make GW2 an even better game.
---
Depends on profession.  Most are 2 maybe 3, but Rev has 4 and Chrono has 4 or 5.
---
As some one who played on release then stopped and fell way far behind - a super bundle would probably entice me again
---
How much do I have to pay to stop seeing all the petty whining on reddit
---
Ah, I see. Mind linking me that?
---
Yes, the main purpose of build storage is so that, if a player sees a necromancer build in chat that they want to try out, while they are playing their guardian, they can store it for later, and to allow them to share their own builds for other classes while on their guardian.
---
All of these are a problem, it's just not worth the energy of complaining for 7 years straight.
---
[ posted on ](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/88856):
---
Nothing about the icebrood track being fixed, tho.
---
&gt; my response to the criticisms is "you like it less, I like it more." Positive viewpoints matter as well as negative ones.
---
"I like it and your criticisms don't apply to me so they don't matter" is not a valid argument.
---
Just the one I play the game with.
---
&gt; it might be starting to get too late.
---
It already is too late. It started when the core game went F2P, and culminated when the two expansions got bundled together for $30. The entire game is basically on a F2P model now.
---
Same. And about 3 characters per class. However, I only have 1 support chrono whom I have to manually switch traits for every niche encounters, it's tiring.
---
&gt; Seimur Oxbone will now provide chef vendor services in the home instances of players who have unlocked the Gourmet Training collection.
---
Yey. This should be included by default but better now than never.
---
One. I set character and equip. If I want a different build or specialization I just use another character slot.
---
&gt; Complaints about not having build templates ended ages ago.
---
That is 100% wrong...
---
No bugfix of the Icebrood Saga reward track resetting to zero every day?
---
I know I'm going to sound like an a-hole but let's not forget it took 6+ months for a dismount skill for warclaw that players have been asking since it's release.
---
They won't because changing UI is impossible and build templates took many years already, and they don't even need moving components and multiple detailed breakdowns/menus.
---
I am doubting if they even have the spaghetti code knowledge to integrate a DPS meter into current UI. Haven't most of their engine and original backend designers moved to Amazon now? Just content teams left.
---
Well, you're playing a game that's focusing on open world stuff, has been for the last seven years. If you don't like that, you're off the mark.
---
&gt; Warclaw: Added a new skill called Lance. The skill is obtained by training it in the warclaw Rank and Abilities line. The skill allows you to throw a lance at a target. If the target is a mounted player, it will dismount both you and the target if it hits.
---
This is big. I love that.
---
And all minions
---
Microtransactions. Microtransactions everywhere
---
30 on warrior. But I'm pretty anal about optimizing. Condi, three power rune sets for core + berserker with and without spotter. Core + berserker for fractals with 2 different foods. Spellbreaker builds for the rare situations when it's needed. Some special builds like Thaumanova heat room or Deimos handkite.
---
You know there's a huge thing people are missing here. Back when exotic gear was the standard and very easy to get you could play any random build you wanted. You could have some weird fun stuff going. Ascended gear was/is too expensive to have random gear sets and people usually only go for what's best/meta. The only flexibility you have is when you have a full set of legendary armor. Apart from one ring and a amulet you can play around with your stats. Build templates was something that could give part of that fun flexibility back. Something the game has been missing since Gw1. It's not so much about the cost but the actual limitations set on people unless your willing to pay. While I understand that the gear templates have a cost (due to it actually storing gear) the build part should be unrestricted. A lot of people just settle on guides but some of us like to experiment with gear/build combo's just for the fun of it.
---
Exactly.
---
I just use a pet to distract them.
---
When developers do poorly work than any modder is the normal way of action .
---
Off-screen, yeah. In the actual episode they tell you Crecia's been trying to convince  Bangar to give them a chance for years
---
Which is what I have been doing till now.
---
The thing is I tried to get along with as less builds as possible 'til we get build templates, but ANet let me down here.
---
Was planning to set up gear templates for
---
- PvE power
---
- PvE condi
---
- PvE support/Heal
---
- PvE open world /node farming
---
- WvW zerg
---
- WvW roaming 
---
As soon as I got (at least) the legendary armor on the character (yeah was aiming for 9 full legendary toons 'til the announcement dropped) but that would be 4+ gear slots per toon not even getting to the actual builds. 
---
Tl;Dr aimed for 6+ builds per char, probably won't happen anymore
---
Because expansion features haven't been monetized?   
---
Glider skins, Mount skins, ect.
---
Actually most ppl just use the same build
---
That's sucks. I'd rather to see the entire price for the tab to unlock these locked slots.
---
Scourge Minion Master is OP!
---
Yooo is roaming 20% restored?
---
Couldn't agree more. People can be mad about this, but it's fucking delusional to call it predatory. Gem store stuff can be purchased with gold, without spending a single dollar, and there's zero RNG involved in buying template slots. I hate this move, but it's not fucking predatory. It's just shitty.
---
Derp, but if you're on foot and in combat, you can't mount up to use the Lance skill, eh?
---
Or is Lance usable any time?
---
I don't suppose skins change with the templates? Or is it just the equipment that changes and the skins stay the same? 
---
Would be nice to create an outfit and save it without needing the equipment.
---
Spending Gold for character slots instead does not resolve their issue.
---
I have about 3 or 4 builds that I have on my thief I use for raiding, with the main being a power Daredevil build, a rifle Deadeye build with some seperate Assassin's pieces for Pylon DPS on Wing 7's Qadim, and a Condi Daredevil build. The latter one doesn't really see any use nowadays due to the small nerfs condi thief has been getting over the last couple of balance patches, so I could probably just live with only having 2.
---
It really is going to depend on the price per template whether I would want to convert some gold into gems for that condi set, but its honestly not really a neccesity at this point.
---
But you CAN save a build in a txt-file on your computer and link that.
---
Its about time! I'm so excited!
---
You don't get to decide what I do or don't need.
---
Stat swapping every piece of gear, inserting new runes, sigils and stat infusions takes more than 30 seconds.
---
- Can you play fine now?
---
- Can you use ArcDPS after build templates are added to the game?
---
- Is this purely a convenience for players already using other substitutes for build templates?
---
Im more for a "pay for what you use" monetization model. So for every 1000 DPS shown in the log, you pay 1 euro. Ez.
---
I guess the colours and the skin is saved on the equip so giving differend equip different looks is a nice thing to do, but I hope there will be a solution for the legendary equip to fit in the different styles.
---
3. Go to options, content guide, set to disable events and personal story. Only map completion will be shown, including unexplored areas.
---
you can totally outlast them on scourge and even core necro
---
reaper wasn't designed for that but for burst melee dps and it does exactly that
---
That you now get to free up two build worth of gear, for free, for every character.
---
Thats a truckload of storage space anet is handing you for free. And you're complaining it's not enough. 
---
And the gear is the only issue here. Everyone can just use text files for skill templates, that's a non-issue. So unless you're telling me that you seriously have three full sets of gear on each of your 25 characters, this is a win for you. Even still, you get the benefit of sharing builds and extra storage space. Oh, and you get hot-swapping of builds out in open world and WvW, something arcdps can't do right now either. All of that is free, baseline functionality. 
---
As a trade, they want some gems if you want even more functionality. And that's not good enough? 
---
This community, man.
---
Yep. They'll be back out in force and population will drop more.
---
So why are you allowed to tell me what I am allowed to believe? This is convenience. Simple as that. You don't need it.
---
That’s not true. There’s lots of dialogue about it in the story and open world.
---
oh snap, anet did read my comment :D
---
Wish every class got a Warrior/Necro amount of attention in this balance patch. Or any other. Then it'd be good for a quarterly balance update cadence.
---
*squints at original WC release and legendary upgrades*
---
riiiight
---
Arcdps templates didn't come with their own inventory space, and it wouldn't work with the permanent bank access to pull items from your bank. ArenaNet's solution is much better.
---
Isn’t auto loot  Central Tyria Mastery?
---
This is the question i'd like answered, if i customize the skin of a piece of equipment is that saved in the individual template or applied across all templates? Hopefully the former.
---
I only have one set of equipment but do change skins regularly depending on my mood, fashion templates would be awesome.
---
Any ideas for the Waypoint and Bag?
---
OK, show me how you swap builds manually in 30 seconds.
---
not on the read team no, there is only one jumping point
---
&gt; You use the word "tolerated" like anet was unhappy with it.
---
I'm using it because it was specifically forbidden by the ToS and an exception was given for it after the fact.
---
Yeah but it's literally off-screen in that it was never brought up at all until this episode
---
Indeed!
---
And people gave them hell for it. And now when they actually take their time to try and avoid making mistakes again people whine about that too.
---
800 per slot is a fair price make these white knights pay to help support the game instead of hiding behind reddits.
---
hmm maybe if I'm invested in the game I already have things I'd rather be working on rather than using gold to buy back functionality I already had 4head
---
The whole thing of me using your insulting answer to my previous comment just went over your head or what?
---
I don't even care about the game at the moment.
---
You trying to make solid and firm point with a language like that throws the whole thing under the bus.
---
If you where to not behave so angry and insulting I would be willing to listen to you.
---
Four PvE builds for my Main Guardian: Power DH, Power FB, Condi FB, Heal FB
---
No.
---
No, I just think your post is obnoxious, and I wanted to reply "STFU!"
---
Moved towards Marauder's myself.  I'm a necro, gimme all of the hit points.
---
Now the zergers gonna complain they're getting ganked and leaving while roamers return
---
This is good. Random people would trigger it as 2-3 people not realising they cannot get more, often times leading to stupidly long strike missions.
---
&gt;  water 2  as decent dps skill
---
So much for shatterstone jokes.
---
&gt; I don't have many builds because I'm too lazy to bother switching
---
That's what build templates are supposed to fix. You're supposed to feel more open to switch at will. This should be a fucking staple in an MMO, instead we're being charged for that convenience. Anyone who takes this lying down deserves to have anet's hand in their wallet for the next few years.
---
W..what? But this is a change on something that is already released. 
---
It is almost like r/guildwars2 asked for them for a search bar, to be able to search stats directly (power etc) and a way to apply to all instead of 1 by 1 and Anet improved it according to the feedback.
---
Oh the horrors of giving feedback and receiving higher quality features in return. What were we thinking?!?
---
Damn you are right, why did I not think of that before
---
Well, glad I spent all of last night throwing my greatsword around.  Be interesting to see how this effects Soulbeast rotations and builds.  Was hoping for a major upset to possibly prompt a weapon change to the meta, but I don't think the changes to sword will matter enough to do anything.
---
Yeah I've been trying that, I just don't know what the best rotation would be. I think swapping to water for s h a t t e r s t o n e would be nice
---
Fixes can be implemented after the patch notes are finalized?
---
Use the "/maploadinfo" command line so you get a status blurb during map loads.
---
Check what it's doing in those 2 minutes.
---
I stopped raiding for 2 months and now when I start pugging/helping guildies, it pours in ascended and extra rare items. So it's a good life for many casual players like myself.
---
Didn't think so.
---
I've been thinking about creating a mesmer mainly for WvW, and I wonder If the new balance update would affect the [Shatter Mirage](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Mirage_-_Shatter_Mirage) WvW build?
---
Look at all this space I've been given to put my nothing in! 
---
Oh look a socket. Better put a plug in it, [https://www.reddit.com/r/PortraitProphecies/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PortraitProphecies/)
---
Yes, but you don't have access to Central Tyria masteries until you buy at least one expansion. Free and core accounts cannot unlock them.
---
Who cares lol
---
Which is locked behind having an expansion. Expansions give access to the Mastery System. F2P are stuck capping at 80 and that's that.
---
That's my point, if end game is not the focus, and you barely get an open world episode every 3-4 months, is it worth to pay a sub?
---
Sounds like too much effort to "fake dps".
---
I have no anime girl reaction image for this, but it's difficult to find one whose face says "I expected it to be bad, I was right, but somehow that doesn't make me feel better".
---
Same here.  I kinda want them to raise the character slot cap tbh.
---
They should be separate, bc they serve different purposes.  Honestly build templates aren't that important - equipment templates have a much bigger impact.
---
Let's see after how many lancings I'll stop logging in to WvW even for the dailies.
---
GW1 did not have equipment templates.
---
They had PvP equipment, akin to what we have with our PvP builds now. But there was no equipment templates or way of storing and loading armors and weapons. And thats the big difference between GW1 builds and GW2. You'll be able to freely swap and trade skill templates as text codes, just like you could in GW1. Just use a text file. The thing you're paying for in GW2 is the ability to swap builds as a hotkey, and the storage space from equipment templates.
---
No I just don't want them to ban the template add on that we have been using for years. No free staff, no additional setting: just don't screw with the 150 templates I already have with all my alts.
---
I’m quite upset about that but if we could at least save equipment templates we could keep them all on a text file for a temporary bandaid.
---
I'll have to pay attention now instead of running through everything I guess. Bad for zerglings who want to get back to zerg but good for roamers who need them to get "fights".
---
The idea of making WvW more accessible due to mounts ferrying players to zergs is just not reality. Populations still declining and newbies who would log off if they didn't get a free and safe ticket back to zerg are still going to quit to some factor or another. But protecting players with mounts isn't going to stop them from dying on engage.. )
---
Huh. Me and my friends where just talking about how it was dumb that everything in the new zone is in Tyrian time, but there isn't actually a way to see Tyrian time.
---
Problem solved.
---
This is something I genuinely don't understand. How does arc make it easier for small changes like changing a sigil or a single piece of gear, for example, as is common for fractals? How is opening the build template menu and selecting your specific template with that one sigil change any different than opening your hero panel and dragging the sigil over yourself? That's what I do and have never thought that I needed build templates to do that so I'm curious.
---
It happened offscreen while the commander was taking a break in Dragon Bash and the Four Winds Festival.
---
The skills they changed on sword weren't in the normal rotation anyway. The only change to the rotation that I can see it that you don't throw GS4 anymore.
---
I wasn't calling anyone names... 
---
And I'll mount up and cast it in 6 hours when I get home from work.  But in the meantime I figured I'd ask a question.  Shame on me!  zero internet points today!
---
Too much effort? It would literally take less than 30 seconds. People are already faking drops (which probably takes longer) so it is quite likely that they would also be willing to spend effort on faking build.
---
If that is supposed to be the same chair, they need to fix it.
---
imagine instabuying chairs
---
So you ordered one off wish.com?
---
For character equipment templates, I'd say around 400 gems (same as a bag slot) wouldn't be unreasonable. Like mentioned, it is a 19-slot bag of sorts so they could be competiting with bags in a sense. For the others, I'd say less per slot but maybe a similar price for a bundle of a few?
---
But if it were something like 800 per for equipment that is a bit much and for build it is way too much. While equipment does hold items, compared to bag, bank, and storage expanders, templates are largely QoL. It really isn't that hard to swap builds or equipment so it shouldn't cost that much to get a quick option.
---
If they charge too much per template, it won't be worth the cost. For example, my Ele mainly uses Berserker or Muarader Armor with Berserker TRinkets; so simple, two templates, right? Well, note quite since I have WvW Berserker Trinkets and Fractal Berserker Trinkets, so that would add 4 variations. Factor in the two Staves with the different sigil and it snowballs even more; even if I did just sigil swap my legendary. So it would make more sense to just swap the staff and even trinkets myself, but if I'm doing that, it starts to defeat the point of having a template anyway... Still, I might spend $10 for a couple of templates to save from swapping trinkets, but even that is a bit much for such a small thing.
---
&gt; Why are you monetizing a key feature
---
Because bootlickers are willing to pay for it. Supply and demand.
---
&gt;access to more than 6 build templates  
---
It's called notepad and copying your links. Dont want to do that drop a couple hundred gold to save 5 seconds.  
---
&gt;skill templates not being treated as equally valuable as build templates 
---
That's because one is "hey, we saved you a few clicks" the other is "hey, we saved you a few clicks and gave you 17 slots of storage for free"  
---
&gt;6 is not enough.  
---
How so exactly? You get 6 per character, we dont yet know if WvW is split so let's take the safe route. You have a DPS build, a condi build, open world and a healer build. That leaves 2 for WvW so it's a bit tight, but a notepad would solve that issue or swapping before hand when you change game modes and that's assuming you are not running your dps in open world like most people do or swapping one trait which imho is worthless to use up a slot and that WvW isnt separate. If it is (and it should be) that leaves 4 open for WvW which is plenty and 2-3 open for PvE
---
The Flame Legion storyline concluded nearly a decade ago, in 2012. Maybe 2013, with the remnants joining Scarlet.
---
Their impersonator was killed in the 2012 CoF storyline. AND his revival was stopped!
---
They are in a "surrender or die" position.
---
Well it's pretty obvious that you literally know nothing about computers nor game security...
---
If it was as simple as 'hacking in items' by editing your loadouts then people could have figured out how to do that long ago using just cheat engine or something similar.
---
It's supposed to be the same one at least.
---
I'm guessing the bag is where all the necro tears from update notes go.
---
Since you are the second one who read that wrong I should make myself clearer.
---
It is not about storing your equipment inside your local.dat, that would be stupid. My argument was to have unlimited amounts of entries to store your templates. That, however, would be quite a lot of data if every player could save everything they want to as someone has pointed out already when it is saved in the database.
---
However, my point was that you don't store it in a database but rather use the hashes or whatever is used to actually share the builds and store it on the computer of the player like the local.dat or a separate folder which contains simple text files from which you can load the template instead of having it all on the server.
---
And that was only for the build template and not the gear template as I have already pointed out. And that wouldn't really be hackable since you can't really give you skills that you can own in the first place.
---
Basically, I was thinking about the way GW1 did it.
---
Will the chatcodes work? If so guild message could be the band-aid.
---
Never tried to mail chat codes, if it works could also be a thing.
---
Of course. All you need is to enjoy yourself. I don't see instanced, organized PvE content as "endgame" and wouldn't enjoy another WoW-clone in that regard, so it wouldn't be worth the sub for me, hence I don't play another raid "endgamer".
---
I just tested that and it's amazing and great.  If they fix legendary rune/sigil bugs, I'd start making them for other characters.
---
I'm sad though that bloodstone fen jewelry can't have this applied.  I tested that. I reset them all, tried to customize, but no checkbox.
---
Stop looking at reddit then, at least not after a controversial announcement.
---
But sucks tremendously for everyone wanting to low-man it, doesn't it? Every competent, organized player who'd easily two-man or solo the content now is fucked and needs unlocker.
---
Thanks for supporting the game.
---
I make a great team!
---
But there has to be a limit, right? Why not set the limit at "okay, let's not charge people to save their fucking builds". I mean, right? Am I out of my fucking mind for thinking that's just too god damned far?
---
I will wait until I see the prices to raise my pitchfork. I was expecting that there would be some monetization for extra build template slots, but if its 800 per extra template I will be mad. I am indifferent about accountwide vs per player template expansions as some classes need more template than others. Between a more expensive accountwide template expansion and cheaper character bound template expansion, I would choose the latter as I am a cheapskate.
---
Though the 3 build template vs 2 equipment template is bit annoying. I can't see a reason why they would leave it uneven, unless they want to force people to buy one more equipment template slot to match.
---
Oh I'm sorry I offended you and your $7 coffee that you get 2x a day. Glad you think im a scarecrow.
---
Pretty sure that roul's old rotation uses both attunements on every 2 or 3 fire swaps. Now you just swap when fire is on cd.
---
...you really don't know the difference between a hacking tool that intercepts and modifies location data in the data packets sent and received by the server, hacking the actual database where your item data is stored, and modifying a local file stored on your own computer?
---
You think those are equivalent tasks? 
---
And you call \*me\* ignorant about computer security?
---
Hasn't Scourge been fairly dominant in WvW and PvP since 2017 and hasn't Reaper been getting constant buffs pretty much since the same time? Even Core Necro shroud got a look in recently.
---
We don't even know what the cap is on buying more gear slots. The preview showed 6 tabs, which would *still* be a huge downgrade from "literally infinite" even *after* a bunch of microtransactions.
---
oh my fucking god
---
I'm pretty sure he means the opposite, it's fixed, but it won't be mentioned until the first late patch notes is released.
---
Faking build doesn't make your dps better though.
---
&gt; * Signet of Air: This skill can now be activated to break stuns without a target. **Activating the skill while out of range of a target or without a target while not under control effects will put it on interrupt cooldown.**
---
A lot of targeted skills could use that.
---
Its a generic option for all posts, why do you want to report patch notes?
---
Much better, imo!
---
At some point you would have paid more total on a subscription than you would have by buying the occasional convenience items ArenaNet offers.
---
Sounds like something I wouldn't need to buy.  Never saw a need for it in any game I've played.
---
Lets see...
---
*Necro: 5
---
*Mesmer: 5 full setups + 4 gear only setups &amp; 3 traits only setups
---
*Elementalist: 5
---
*Ranger: 6
---
*Engineer: 3
---
*Thief: 6
---
*Warrior: 6 
---
*Revenant: 6 
---
*Guardian: 7
---
Not including wvw which would probably add 1 more to each for my occasional visit.
---
Ya but some all ready have had some of this level of rework
---
I suppose the lance is a good change though it'll be even more annoying now to get away from gankers near your spawn
---
I'm sorry the only argument you can have is against your own made up strawmen.
---
Eye of the North was my guess. Alpine is the eternal name for the Shiverpeaks region, and zones get internally named as "Region.Zone" e.g., "Valley.Arch" for Lion's Arch. So Alpine Eye could be early rendition to mean region:Alpine(Shiverpeaks) zone:Eye (of the North).
---
"Few" being the operative word.
---
Not many people has enough legendary gear.
---
Scrapper only needs one build in total. Perfect example of a sidegrade elite spec.
---
A charr chair too small for charr...
---
Inb4 can be dodged.
---
&gt;	 i would prefer a sub fee over the monetization style gw2 has
---
I would stop playing immediately.
---
That makes it awfully hard to use one for PvP, one for WvW, and one for PvE right out of the gate. I still after all have to equip the appropriate weapons in my character to use the standardized PvP gear-sets.
---
Will we have any 'magical' template labels that auto-load and unload those two based on entering and leaving those modes?
---
WTF? The legal term for that is "actionable".
---
If only they had other things to monetize, like I don't know, loot boxes or paid skins...
---
Yes. You must now be facing and have "Line of Sight" to use Power Lock on your target. Viz. you cannot use Power Lock running away from your target with Camera "Look Behind." AND you cannot use Power Lock behind a Tree/Pillar/Obstacle. You must have Line of Sight. Otherwise it's the same.
---
Maybe the charr in the advertisement is smaller than yours! ^(/s)
---
&gt;You can't expect a company this big to live of bread crumbs
---
Yeah what would this poor company do without you here to defend them. They are literally living on ramen noodles, each and every one of them.
---
This is only for the public versuon right? If you want to solo or duo just creat a swuad and make a private party.
---
Yeah I know the old rotation with Water2 and Earth5, but it still feels a bit awkward, probably just need some time to getting used to but I'm sure once SC or someone finds a good fluid rotation this should be a buff
---
If he said "it's fixed now" that means it went out with the latest patch.  But he missed the patch-note window, which seems to indicate that fixes can be implemented after the patch-notes are finalized, which is what I was clarifying.
---
I like it, got one of the new barrier effect yet?
---
Uhm? Like running for 1 hour in WvW? You get so many of those notary thingies.
---
Just as advertised!
---
Oh boiiii
---
Sadly I'm kinda not playing these days anymore.. but still nice to see this.
---
Hahahahaha
---
I will just have one for each elite, so fcking useful
---
No feature is free in any kind of game. It's always paid somehow...and when you do not directly pay, because you're not forced to do so like say...an xpac, someone else is doing it for you with optional purchases.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cz1rrb/build_templates_only_available_with_legendary/eywxzz9/
---
Yeah, it's too far. 
---
Put it this way. Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that it took a team of ten programmers working on templates about 100 hours to work on this (this is database code, art, everything, I'm just lumping everyone in with the title of "programmer"). That's also including all the meetings that everyone would need to go to to make decisions about the project, the project managers running the project (or their share of the time spent on this project), etc etc. That's 1000 man hours, and I bet that's a lowball. A "programmer's" salary is probably about $50k, but in general a company's actual overhead for your work is about double that between taxes and healthcare and whatever, so let's assume that ANet spends $100k on one programmer for a year (again, lowball, and it's not taking into account that some of the people working on this are almost certainly better paid and higher up in the company). In a year, assuming a 40 hour work week and a 50 week work year, you're going to get about 2000 work hours out of a programmer. So, 1000 man hours is about one guy for half the year. 
---
Therefore, ANet spent about $50k (under this conservative estimate) on this project alone. 
---
And you don't think they're going to want to recoup that? Newsflash: nothing that is done in a game company is done without having metrics on the ROI for the feature. If they're dropping that much money over the course of X months (and obviously this is not the only thing that these programmers were working on, and they weren't working on it all at once, which is why it did not actually take one programmer 6 months to make), they're going to want an idea of how much they can stand to make from it.
---
ANet is a business. Every piece of content released (in ANY GAME EVER) is made to either be sold, or make money by incentivizing you to buy something else. We're fortunate that GW2 is so frickin easy on our wallets as it is. 
---
For reference, assuming they sell packets of four equipment templates at 400 gems (we don't have numbers), and 400 gems = $5, then they need to sell a pack of four equipment templates to 10k people **just to break even,** and that's again using my conservative estimates here and these made up numbers that I'm just guessing at. Frankly, that's a pretty thin profit margin as it is, because I don't think there are that many people who use arcdps right now, and for everyone who isn't using arcdps, the build templates that are coming are going to be, alone, a HUGE upgrade. 
---
So yeah. Charging for this is justified. People need to get the fuck over themselves.
---
Arc is removing the functionality once build templates come out. This is part of the agreement between them and Anet that allows it to be used.
---
So then charge for the free storage space, not the ability to click a button and swap your build, which should be an absolute staple in a game such as this one where build and equipment swapping is such an integral part of the experience.
---
Fuck that I gave you an internet point.
---
Chrono: 17
---
Guard: 13
---
Literally the entire reason we wanted build templates **is so we didn't have to spread our builds around a bunch of different characters**
---
As I only really play one character I am forced to adapt in build and role quite a bit.
---
I don't really play PvP. So none here.
---
PvE:
---
1. pChrono with Focus
---
2. pChrono with GS
---
3. cChrono
---
4. cMirage
---
5. Support Chrono
---
6. Solo variant of pChrono
---
7. pMirage wirh GS
---
8. Open World variant of Support Chrono
---
WvW:
---
1. Shatter Core Mesmer with PU
---
2. Shatter pMirage
---
3. Interrupt pMirage
---
5. Illusion of Life Chrono :/
---
6. Gs pMirage
---
Literally the entire reason we wanted build templates is so we didn't have to spread our builds around a bunch of different characters
---
&gt;The public version
---
Your charr need more flow to sit like that
---
Now make it an account bound station.
---
I feel like the baseline should be 2 slots per character/per xpac. 
---
One main + one alt for each 'spec' (core, HoT spec, PoF spec). 
---
Then you sell slots to those players who must have a slot for every little skill swap they make. The price should set at something that would be a moderate gold dump if you want to go gold-&gt;gems.
---
Yup that's my plan as well. Notepad for builds, and manually for gear (downgrade from arcdps). I have way too many gear sets for Guardians at the moment: Berserkers, Assassins, Vipers, Minstrels, Harriers. Some of those have rune/infusion variations too. All of this was handled by 1 legendary armor set and arcdps, but in the future I'd have to manually change everything on my legendary? Fuck that.
---
Sorry, we are not all playing bearbow ranger in open world you know.
---
Just is weird to have a pink Orders from Above now.
---
Agreed. If you want to "support" anet, send them a fucking check in the mail.
---
I just don't see how 45 to 60€ per episode can be justified.
---
2h of story at most, with some running around pressing F and 11111 every 3 months while paying a sub fee is really bad value no matter how much you enjoy yourself.
---
It's ok for you to like the game that much, but you can't pretend something like that would be acceptable.
---
Tbh, they do both sound exactly the same.  Basically build templates for clothes.
---
Gaming today is GaaS
---
Erm, I use a Krytan Drakehound, tyvm
---
Might very well be a back end fix, which they can roll out whenever they feel like it.
---
Speed running full clears during mondays. Those 45 seconds do add up and in the end it can be closer to 30 minutes of downtime.
---
"It's entitled not to think not sending them checks without compensation in the form of a good product is acceptable."
---
Ok ok I've vented enough.
---
would be better if we can get a time like this for the minimap aswell, like we have with server time now
---
Thank you for your sacrifice
---
Anyone know if it can be dodged?
---
I understand the balance reason.  But the last thing players new to the mode need is every group of heavy mouth breather gankers being able to dismount you on the way to your tag without being able to do nothing about it.
---
I'd even argue that to use it, you should be dismounted even if it doesn't hit... But hey took em 6 months to add even this.
---
How is that predatory
---
Isn't that the sigil of rage?
---
This is exactly the problem. The business model stopped being "make the game better, and reap the rewards when the game becomes popular again". The business model is now "identify what people want, design it in such a way that we can maximize profit while ignoring how it affects the game". This game is a shell of what it once was. It is being used to bleed people dry until the population dries up.
---
Yeah dude how dare other players attack you in a PvP game mode
---
It says that "Valid items for stats are equipped legendary items, **separated into groups of armor, weapons, and trinkets.** "
---
So trinkets are separated from armor, likely because they don't take runes.
---
It is account bound as is an achievement that you do once and then you have to only level up chef but yeah, it could be done easier - some Gift of Gourmet Chef perhaps? To dump least useful cooking materials...
---
Anets build templates seem way better than arc you can’t argue that. Apart from the price. And anet isn’t a bank they’re a company that makes products that people buy. What is it that you don’t understand?
---
Since the game was released...
---
GW1 **did not allow you to store equipment templates** (outside of PvP, which functioned differently). 
---
GW2 **will not allow you to share equipment templates** (because despite the name, they're more similar to a second inventory than a single clickable summary of your gear).
---
You cannot easily "hash" a list of equipment while also keeping it available for editing, and players expect to be able to interact with their items. So what GW2 will do, is lock those items in essentially a second inventory, which must be stored in the same way that item data is stored in the rest of the game because every other system in the game will depend on being able to query those database entries as if it's your currently equipped gear.
---
Just, no. Your idea would not work. Computers and databases are not magic, you cannot hash an entry to secure it on your local environment, but also have it be available for stuff like quick-swapping or simply reading and editing it in the build editor.
---
Oh TIL.
---
Just tried the trinkets and it doesn’t seem to include back item.
---
I actually need template for options! I love WvW, PvP, Raid PvE and story/Lore, and Everytime I need to change 4+ options.. Is so frustrating
---
I'd really like for ascended gear to act like legendary and let us change stats... It costs so much to craft, I don't want to build more than 1 of each armor set....
---
Hell no.
---
Condi Renegade, Power Renegade (shush), Diviner's Alacrity Renegade (Raid var.), Diviner's Alacrity Renegade (Fractal var.; more 'zerk pieces as fractal potions make up the boon duration), Harrier's Alacrity Renegade, some mostly Magi's thing for handkiting.  
---
I could roll the two Diviner's one into one and manually swap over a couple of pieces, but for the rest of them(bar the two templates we do get) that's ~fifteen pieces of gear to find in my inventory and swap over one by one each time I want to change.  
---
It feels like they're trying to strong-arm us into giving them money by taking away a convenience we had for free and charging to get it back because it's really annoying to have to switch the gear manually, and there's no way I'm going to play along.
---
hmm....that's a good point.  Tho why wait for patch day, then?
---
Doesn't look like a bug fix on the achievement 'Picante' for spending 300 peppers at a festival vendor eh
---
Thank you for the info!
---
I just have 1 per character that I update after balance patches.
---
My first thought was "nice, that actually looks kind of mist-like, very fitting for my renegade."
---
No, it's not. Besides who really needs more than 2 equipment slots anyways. All you need is gear for power and gear for condi. It's all pretty much the same few prefixes that people use all the time. Berzerker, Assassin, Diviner, Marauder, Viper and Carrion.
---
But you will have to **if you don't want to pay for them**.
---
You actually can!
---
Then why are people crying about having only 2 build templates when they don't have any yet?

The fuck you talking about? This change unequivocally makes the game better. Arcdps is not the game, it's a hack that they allowed people to use because they didn't have a competing functionality yet, but they didn't have to let that happen. The only way build templates can **in any way** be described negatively is in relation to arcdps, and arcdps was not a widely adopted tool.
---
For the vast majority of the game's population, build templates will be exactly "make the game better, and also reap the rewards when people like it and want to use it more."
---
yeah, but scrapper is an engineer that have multiple spec
---
It's a Legionchair...  
---
Also, to all the Charr friends out there, apparently there's a bit of a sizing issue.
---
Helmet maybe.
---
 Chest/legs 99% no.
---
So... No fix for the Visage of the Khan-Ur's abysmal low droprate?   
---
That thing is currently being listed at 10K in the TP already.
---
Well, also flipping a camp or shaving some dolyaks *since you got in anyway* wasn't out of the ordinary.
---
You have evidence that Lance "works correctly and is balanced"?  
---
ANETs trend of late would suggest differently.
---
"Ass fucking"
---
Please. On the build template side, they'll get the positive of being able to check their squad's builds instantly, and the ability to share builds around the community more easily....with he downside of needing to keep an organized text file. That's a wash, at worst. Frankly I think it's a positive.
---
On the equipment template side, they'll have 2 free slots for the big changes, and then they'll be able to sub out specific items. A couple more clicks, but as I said in a previous comment, raids have a **lot** of wait time. The QoL for an open world or WvW player with a fast swap is going to be huge comparatively speaking. Oh, and that's assuming that they don't want to buy even the smallest amount of equipment slots. I'm assuming dedicated raiders use a lot of shared slots for their consumables already, right? So they're not averse to paying gems for QoL. 
---
If the raiding community is expecting ANet to make official build templates and then just not charge for something they spent money to make because it inconveniences them, well, they're the ones acting entitled. It's not going to be that bad, and for the majority of the community it's going to actually be a huge positive. 
---
The problem is, this subreddit is skewed towards the hardcore players, and they're all losing their goddamn minds. I don't know what y'all were expecting build templates to be, but they were definitely going to be monetized.
---
I wonder if they even realize how bad the charr sitting posture is for most chairs. They keep spamming it into new chairs, so I guess not.
---
The thing is, when sittable chairs were released for open world, they did a great job with the charr posture. Why are they fucking up the paid chairs, but get the free ones right? It seems very unlike ArenaNet.
---
I want my money back.
---
I dont think the etherbound shoulders qualify as "branded"... it's more of an ethereal magic theme.
---
You should be able to dye to purple color to something else.
---
so the people who don't deserve to be exploited for money?
---
I was one of those people.
---
I expected them to monetize it but I vastly underestimated how many slots they were going to give us for free. I feel as a customer low balled for having to wait 7 years for 2 slots. Not even enough for each game mode to have 1 build slot.
---
It's like ordering 30 chicken nuggets and the restaurant only giving you 1 sauce packet.
---
I super duper did not want to get into an argument about salaries and such, so I went as lowball as I thought I would have to to avoid the argument.
---
It actually does a pretty decent amount of damage. So it will probably be a slight dps increase on sword auto chains, but then slightly lower dps when you switch back to GS. But losing the quick dodge with sword 3 will be annoying. Made it super easy to greed for dps.
---
Here we go, they DID cave to the vocal minority of cancerous players who call themselves "roamers" (while having no idea what "roaming" meant when wvw was at its peak). Mount now useless. Back to spending ages taking down one (or more) of them before you can actually play the game. No I don't rage at getting killed, I can actually take them down. And no, there is no fun and not even satisfaction when it dies after you spent several minutes getting rid of it while you didn't want that fight.
---
&gt; both local/server time and tyrian time though
---
Tick-boxes would be better than a dropdown menu now, yeah.
---
It's convenient for the "story" so it happened somehow ^^
---
Instant Gaming is not an Official Retailer, just a FYI
---
A video game is all text files... Why should they be free? Someone had to get paid to make it, why would we not have to pay for it?
---
Charr at Ooze pits and charr on promo image both use existing animation for a Charr on Dhuum throne from raids. So it's clearly not the matter them not being able to do it since it's literary first animation they did for such items.
---
Core necro is very good in 1vs1. It lacks disengage potential, but compensates it with excellent medium range capabilities.
---
yea but they can't drop aoe spam machines on node that put insane pressure on most of the enemy team either..oh and unparalleled boon hate too
---
it's the price you pay for playing necro, the whole class is balanced around it and has been since forever
---
The subscription fee for this game is not monetary, but a faction of your hope, soul and disappointment each month.
---
I'd rather pay the money.
---
This is why I don't buy items from the store anymore.
---
It's all good :)
---
I prefer the previous effect.
---
literally false advertising
---
It shouldn't put it on any cooldown in that situation, just return "unable to cast right now."
---
I'll copy what I wrote in the main notes thread:
---
&gt; * WvWers kept crying about needing more players.
---
&gt; * ANet added Warclaw to speed up and degank the game to bring in new players. New players got interested.
---
&gt; * WvWers immediately cried about their ages-old status quo being disturbed.
---
&gt; * ANet nerfed Warclaw to the state where it didn't disturb the ages-old status quo as much, and made Warclaw not really interesting for new players anymore. Many new players turned away.
---
&gt; * Gankers kept crying about not being able to gank.
---
&gt; * ANet gave dedicated gankers a veteran-tailored ability to gank the rest of the new players.
---
&gt; Hooray?
---
&gt; The whole situation is ridiculous. Either you shake the stale everything up altogether and ignore the anti-change people, or don't touch it at all and leave as is. Semi-measures just annoy everyone and satisfy no one.
---
I genuinely didn't know about the whole deal, or forgot about it, who knows.
---
Point is, arcDPS actually sucks. It takes fucking forever to switch your gear, every single infusion, every single rune, every single trait. You stand there like a dumbfuck waiting, waiting, waiting. And then it forgets to equip your offhand and you have to re-tell it to switch your gear.
---
I mean, it's great. I got a dozen templates. But it has its issues. So I was always excited to see actual ingame templates and planned to keep the bigger templates on arcDPS, the ones that I'll use a while, once switched, like pDPS, cDPS, etc, and outsource the ones which I switch back and forth quickly to the ingame system. Open world roaming build &lt;-&gt; open world support build, stuff like that.
---
But if the addon is going to get fucked, I'm getting fucked as well.
---
My scourge is in full black and white dyes with equinox weapons. Best change.
---
Kiting and single target like you're describing works in 1v1s-5v5s ish. Anything larger than that and it won't do you any good, and that's most of the interations in WvW outside of roaming.
---
Scourge's 10 target ranged aoe spam is super unhealthy for the game and have dictated the meta since PoF dropped, and that probably won't change any time soon unless the specialization gets reworked from the ground up
---
That's a fair point, forgetting to get the patch note included, instead of implementing a patch after the note window had closed.
---
reaper is mediocre at best for fractals, he get outclassed by burst dps so much its a joke do even compare them ...
---
But yeah open world is reapers strong game mode for having self quickness and might
---
hdd full?
---
No not worry. Fix is up!
---
- "Recovered" Charr Artifacts now have increased rewards: an additional piece of charr-themed gear, one of the four legion keys, and double the chance of receiving a Visage of the Khan-Ur.
---
Now we gonna get 3 or even 4 per week!
---
As a developer, writing up documentation feels like such a chore that it's hard not to delay and end up "forgetting" to do it.
---
It's still slow, easy to kite and very vulnerable to CC.
---
Not worth it, I just have like 6/8 ascended armor sets
---
no
---
&gt; The game clock can now show Tyrian time. Go to the General Options tab of the Options panel and select Tyrian Time from the In-Game Clock dropdown.
---
&lt;3
---
&gt; I can't go in-game to check myself, but I think you're confused.
---
Only that I talked in that part you quoted about build templates, not gear templates.
---
&gt; Nope. You're storing the database entry of the equipment. That's why it's removed from your inventory, so that you dont' go and put that piece of armor in your bank and then the template can't find it later.
---
My Point about gear templates is the following, you are storing the gear in the template window but not in the hash that you can share and the hash can be created from whatever you want.
---
It wouldn't matter much because you probably won't have the referenced equipment somewhere but that doesn't mean it isn't possible, it just wouldn't make much sense.
---
Impersonator?
---
One guy impersonating an entire legion. That sounds like it takes skill.
---
I don't find it hard to believe that things were happening behind our back while we were busy killing dragons.
---
It's not really that big, just means you want to save a dash when running back to your zerg so you can evade lances from lonely gankers.
---
I swear, ArenaNet was so close to making WvW not a frustrating tedious slog, but they're really trying to undo it...
---
Shit, didn't know burst DPS was the only metric for fractals, not comfort, consistency, or QoL, just RAW DPS.
---
Must be why I see so many groups of 4 Weavers and 1 Chrono, and almost NO reapers, certainly not at least 1-2 in every run.
---
and that people actually are able to use them to their full extents.
---
The only practical difference between pricing at 400 gems or 100 gold is which side of the conversion gets affected long-term by gold/gem inflation.
---
Are you kidding me? I played wvw and pvp since release and it always was the main reason to quickly kill any kind of necro, be it core prior HoT or reaper in HoT or scourge. It was slightly different between balance patches where you started to focus the firebrand, because when he cod freeheal the scourge together with scourge sustain you would lose.
---
Honestly this looks like a scaling size bug. I hope you submitted a support ticket.
---
You're confusing 'decent build' with 'decent instanced group content build'. Engie main. Off the top of my head I use:
---
* Solo holo power for open world
---
* Farming build for movement/mob tagging
---
* Condi for backwarg
---
* Power holo raids/fractals
---
* Scrapper dungeon mobskip
---
Could add a couple for PvP and WvW.
---
I don't understand the title.  According to the screenshot, I don't see any "guarantee" of getting a legion key, only that it is part of the loot table.
---
Technology just isn't quite there yet.
---
Very much so. However there is something interesting going on—the meta is changing drastically and quickly. Often I get paired up (about 50% of the time) against players I’ve played with / against before, since there are fewer high ELO players than lower ELO players.
---
I usually like to play condi / healing guardian, and there’s one Firebrand who has lots of sustain and always counters me. I could never beat him in a 1v1.
---
So at the start of the match, I change to my Ranger instead, and suddenly taking him down is easy.
---
This is ‘t just me doing this, everyone is constantly choosing a “meta” and then the rest choose the opposite to counter it, so every match is different since most people have multiple toons with multiple builds. I also play sustain Warrior and precision Reaper, but I’m planning on learning thief and mesmer to add them to the list of available toons at the start of the match.
---
**Build templates slots** should be free, there is no reason for it to be paid. It is just a line that points to what skills/traits the game should activate. This is an unfair move from Arenanet if they sell those slots for gems.  
---
**Equipment templates slots** I'm totally fine with these being monetized because they work as bag slots to keep your armour, weapons and trinkets there without taking up inventory space, I'm okay if they charge 800 gems per Equipment slots. But they should share all the gear placed here within your account so we can access those items in any character at any time without the needed to use the bank to move everything (let's be fair Arenanet, this is a horrible way to do that and you guys should have looked after years ago together with templates). I'm fine if they restrict these slots for account-bound items only
---
It's a concept for a little thing called a sustainable business model. If you push away your consumer base with anti consumer practices then the short term gains won't make up for the fact that they go elsewhere, which they are doing in droves.
---
&gt;Over the years of playing this game I have seeing many posts and videos of people talking about build templates and how they were willing to give their left arm for it and now they are killing themselves because anet decided to monetize it.
---
Oh please you know these are not the same people. All of those posts where people say they would pay for it there are also comments in there saying the opposite. Yes the bitching and "I quit posts" are dramatic or w/e but people are allowed to be unhappy about shit and express it (even if some of them are being big cry babies about it).
---
Most people who play WvW care. Don't act like roaming is some huge majority of the WvW playerbase, lmfao
---
It's almost as if different people want different things and that the game market that attempts to cater to everyone is producing game after game with no clear direction and major design issues at several levels.
---
lmao @ shitty fences trying to pass the promo as their own
---
No, these are just cosmetics. This is a highly impactful gameplay feature
---
Did you buy it from Wish?
---
&gt; is going to get fucked, I'm getting fucked as well.
---
Yeah, this is why people are angry. So far the counterpoint seems to be "Well I don't use it and won't need it, so you'd better pay up you entitled children." I know things aren't going to change, so I'll end up just settling for being a little bit shittier on my mains most of the time, I guess.
---
I'm confused as to why it doesn't look like, you know, a barrier?
---
Instead of a sparkle?
---
As you should
---
the real point:
---
arcdps: free unlimited templates
---
gw2: &lt;|8^)
---
Im not paying for unsupported 3rd parties nobody takes reaponsibility for, thank you.
---
"charr" isn't even a word and you used it twice in this sentence. Do I even have to say I down-voted your comment haha I think it's implied 😂😂
---
Reaper is inferior to Soul Reaping? What?
---
/r/shutupwesley
---
Autoattack in scepter is one of the weakest auto attacks because it relies on a full channel before hitting the strongest scale.
---
Players unhappy with their number of template slots can buy gems
---
Alone on my main mesmer:
---
3 wvw
---
3 open world
---
1 fractals
---
1 pvp
---
Necro also 3 wvw and 2 open world
---
Considering the size on the preview, it could be argued yours is asuran lmao
---
If we don't get a large number if account-shared equipment template slots for legendary armour, can I suggest that ArenaNet allow us to salvage legendary armour somehow? I've had that pile of hot garbage sitting on some alt for years because of how ugly and useless it is, holding out for this patch, but it seems it was for nought.
---
Damn!!!
---
As feared, Ranger Greatsword is now a dead weapon that not only no longer works as intended, there does not not seem to be any intention.  Now that the evade is gone, things that I used to easily kill now kill me.  I know what you are going to say "well you should dodge more", but dodge puts you out of melee range, so you have to run back into the fight. This wouldn't be so bad, but it gives the opponent a run away option.  Usually I could stop them with a double tap of 4, but that is gone now, too.
---
I went back to Arcane tree to test it out and arcane's Elemental Enchantment "fixes" the issue; but I think as others are pointing out doing a dip into water for shatterstone might be better?
---
well, the game suddenly not become "online" anymore just because you store some player skill template information on your computer.
---
And also, what exactly should people do? the code is being loaded and everything that is not being found will not be loaded. there is no modification here or anything, you load something that is then being evaluated if that is possible, everything that is not is discarded.
---
Toughness is not a strong choice in fractals. Nothing about the stat makes it good for fractals since you either get hit by mechanics meant to down you or you get hit with minor damage that a healer wearing diviners gear will be able to patch up. PvE is a DPS mode, defense stats only really serve to set the tank in a few raids.
---
Fuck.
---
I know you are foolish to hope for the removal of this perfectly fine mechanic. What can I say, I want this game to not be braindead.
---
I completely see what you mean. 
---
However I guess there's also more convenience in the equipment "loadout" we are getting than a simple bag slot expansion that can justify pricing it higher than a bag slot expansion, and possibly significantly higher if they unlock another loadout for all characters (so yes, let's say for at least 5 alts). 
---
I'd rather spend more money and have them account wide rather than stuck to characters, I so dump or delete characters and reroll that I would never buy a single one if they were character bound.
---
I agree that 3 builds (per character, right?) sounds fair.
---
Read the whole post...
---
The ranger sword skill change is a hot pile of shit.
---
Processing image...
---
You can still do the same and now people can stop you on your way to taking their camps
---
She might, I accidentally do that in my drawings often
---
In what possible comment did I mention Toughness
---
Wasn't that always a thing? I feel like I saw that option a long time ago, but when I checked a couple days ago I couldn't find it.
---
It's already slated to be retired. ANet demanded it as part of their agreement with delta.
---
Your first mistake was putting the words "GW2 PvP" and "balance" in the same sentence.
---
Of course. They're separate workflows, and the patch notes go through editing and translation before being posted so odds are the cutoff is the Friday before, or maybe early Monday.
---
ABSOLUTELY. It felt *incredibly* forced. There's a few offhand comments about racism thrown in by ambient dialogue NPCs and that's it. We're all cool now.
---
It's just... weird. No real resentment on either side portrayed in the story. Efram's a totally chill guy who's totally peaceful and somehow didn't get brutally murdered on his way to Imperator (despite that being the norm for warband leaders, let alone legionnaires or tribunes).
---
It's a sad case of 'oh, it all happened offscreen, the Legion's reconciled. There's a big story there but you didn't see it'. Which in good storytelling is tantamount to 'it didn't happen and we just shoehorned it in'.
---
I'm not falling for anything... You are just delusional.
---
At 15€/month, that'd be close to the price of a full AAA game per episode... How can you possibly believe that a GW2 Living World episode is worth that much?
---
If Anet tried to pull that off the game would tank instantly, and rightfully so.
---
Low low price of $29.99!
---
Hmm. Acceptable. Still not sure how I feel about this greater embracing of Alacrity as a global mechanic, but it is what it is.
---
Wow, even Bethesda doesn't threaten people who fix their shit FOR FREE.
---
Imma sayin that in order for it to be actually balance, it shouldn't be one or two classes at a time. With this much time between these patches, in ideal world, this should be feasible?  
---
Also, they're extremely hit or miss or "why" in general, like that Deadeye one that didn't do anything good to it or made it any more viable or less clunky, or ChRoNo, or Scrapper. With that kinda speed we can hope for these three to be good to play as in about three years? Or however long Berserker was in obscurity.   
---
But eh. I'm just glad warrior can now flex their abs on puny weaklings to make them feel better. That's something.
---
And yet there were tons of people saying "I would pay for build templates" but when it comes time to actually pay for build templates: "Get your pitchforks, boys!"
---
uh....what?
---
do those big glowy swords illuminate dark areas around you? (like jormag's breath)
---
But only per character. And month.
---
No. Local time and "server time" were the only options. Server time was just UTC.
---
ha ha...lol
---
You'd have to be an idiot to think they would not monetize one of the most wanted features in the game. This is an MMO and if you want GW2 to survive, it needs revenue.
---
Then why monetize it?
---
Nah I'm already playing a fantasy game
---
Aw, but I liked blasting my allies with sand
---
Ah, that's probably what I was thinking of.
---
It's not screen clutter if it's important information you need to avoid dying.
---
2 times nothing is still nothing
---
I actually haven't seen much of a counterpoint at all. But I guess I'm in the "the sky isn't falling" camp. Shit always gets blown out of proportion and I've very rarely shared that kind of hysterics.
---
But that doesn't change that losing the addon is going to hurt like a bitch.
---
On the other hand, it's GREAT news for like 95% of the players. I'm well aware that I'm a niche in this game. I got far too much shit and AP and everything to be Anet's main focus.
---
Imagine you order a takeaway.
---
Hours later, it still hasn't arrived.
---
You make your own food.
---
You're eating your delicious food when your takeaway arrives.
---
The delivery driver takes the food on your plate and tosses it in the bin.
---
They then serve you 3 slices of cold pizza and demands you pay extra for the rest.
---
Would you complain?
---
We wish, but arcdps will be disabled after build templates are officially released :')
---
[what?](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/787/356/d6f.jpg)
---
It's so subtle it's useless. They could've made a slightly more glaring outline on the character or a grounded swirling circle around the character.
---
How many Branded themed armor sets do we have?
---
Beware:runecrafter's will salvage the upgrade. Not simply remove it.
---
I use copper for greens and blues, and I'd recommend it first since it's the majority of what you'll be salvaging.
---
I use silver for yellows, but the mystic isn't much trouble (I used to do it when the Mystic Forger daily was on) so there's not much need to get it.
---
I'd love to take a commission.
---
&gt; This game wasted to be a wow killer potential to do things for casuals instead of hardcores.
---
Every time I see a self-proclaimed "hardcore" player, it's all the same biased entitled complaining all over again (interestingly, almost always also with poor grammar). It's as if *the whole industry needs only you, "hardcore gamers", and no one else but you*. I've already posted this today, here's the same thing again:
---
&gt; No matter how much you people complain about it, it won't change. *The MMO market needs a niche non-P2W game for casual players with low price tags for average content,* that can get compensated by overpriced cosmetics and QoL, and GW2 is exactly this. The fact that you found some parts of the game good enough to join anyway doesn't mean the whole game should be tailored for your needs.
---
&gt; It's literally the same as if I liked some anime targeted at kids because it was cute and wholesome, but then went to complain about how it's not smart and witty and dark enough for my grown-up tastes. If you're in the periphery demographic of a product, your first world problems are your problems - not the seller's, since he designs systems for their 80% of the buyers because those take 20% effort and it's the most conscious business decision to make.
---
You know what this game wasted? **This game wasted a perfect casual PvE MMO potential by trying to do PvP, WvW and Raids.** Just imagine how much more great content PvE could've had if the resources weren't spent on those infinitely problematic tacked-on game modes that only a handful of people play.
---
&gt; Go play fortnite thats good for bad players.
---
What you wrongfully assume that I and other players like me *even want* to play a PvP mode. Why'd you assume that? Well because obviously, all *real* gamers are competitive alpha-males who sit at home to dominate others in competitive environments, right?
---
Wrong. We, "casuals", can tolerate and somewhat enjoy WvW/PvP if it's comfortable enough. We either play with a cool Warclaw and without gankers, or just don't.
---
So, yeah, I was fine with not touching WvW after World Completion was removed from it. You could've had your WvW without any mounts for what I care - because yes, it's completely fine to have hard-only games like Dark Souls! - but ANet added them anyway in a mostly useless way that satisfies neither of the crowds, thus my attitude.
---
Same reason they sell extra bag slot, bank slots, and crafting licenses. Convenience.
---
&gt; GW2 is an improved GW1
---
Controversial opinion.
---
Then people could spam the skill until it kicks.
---
Thats a cool and thorough answer. Thanks!
---
Looks like I wasn't far off with my feelings. Maybe SWTOR spoiled me in that regard, doesn't hold a candle in combat to GW2 though.
---
Will check out the wiki!
---
Out of all the complaining people are doing, this is the one gripe I can get behind. Legendaries need to be incorporated in a way that allows for any stat choice at any time -- easily.
---
Guild wars 2 isn't a clicker game where the core gameplay is to stockpile items. It's a game in a franchise that has always focused on highly customizable and personalizable gameplay that is meant for players to constantly adjust their skills and abilities to adapt to different situations. To claim otherwise is to willfully ignore 14 years of design and gameplay in order to protect a corporation that ultimately doesn't care about you
---
Boonless med kit support too, don't forget.
---
With the overhaul of Death Magic (which, as a minion master, looks pretty sweet!), I was hoping they’d add a “store” button like Ranger has to remove minions to deal with aggro issues. Can’t tell you the amount of hate I get when my minions wont stop beating on something... I don’t know if that’d be unbalancing in some way though.
---
ROAMING HAS NO PLACE IN WVW AND FUCK EVERYONE THAT THINKS DIFFERENT/s
---
They all convenience(though one could argue a character slot is more than just convenience) so their value is exactly the same.
---
Get back to me when you're being chased by 4 enemy players in their territory, and you only have 3 dodges.
---
Before you likely would have been able to get away, especially if you're on a mobility spec. 
---
But now?  GG
---
Yeah, but he was saying to attach the skins to the gear templates. And that would mean you could not equip them separately. 
---
It's better if you can switch the appearance of your armor separately from switching the stats, in their own slots.
---
"Hey Joe, we just gave charr their own LS episode. Do you think we can go back to screwing them over on vanity items?"  
---
"Yeah, who cares, it's just charr."  
---
I feel really welcome in the game, ANet.
---
I wouldn't, I hate subscriptions.
---
Why wasn't this in the patch notes???
---
But isn't this the best MMORP with a buy-once play as much as you want value in the market? You are right, and I understand why some people are upset (as everybody I would prefer if everything was free of charge, included World of Warcraft Classic and FF XIV), but even if they complain they are not leaving the game. 
---
So yes, the $ sign would be funny,  and at the same time I prepare for the downvotes from our beautiful community :)
---
Just like we don't owe them gem store sales. We can log in to play the new LW episode every 3 months as they intended and then move on with our lives. Or they can charge for that too and we can uninstall. Either way works
---
That's the whole point of it. Just like the Chak Egg Sac.
---
I'm not protecting a corporation. I'm saying that people who are bitching and moaning **for getting what they wanted** are silly and entitled.
---
I am so grateful, I am about to burst in excitement.
---
200 acceptable, 400 absolute maximum.
---
If you don't have 17 templates, you aren't trying hard enough.
---
^^\(I ^^actually ^^have ^^a ^^gathering ^^template.)
---
People are overreacting, plain and simple.
---
It'd be nice if they scaled the chair scaled based on the race of the character.
---
You are right. Leave the game for something better! World of Warcraft Classic is having lots of amazing criticism, and it'is only 13 USD per month and you can play retail WoW for the same price!
---
Well you said equipment templates in the first post, so you're talking out of both sides of your mouth. I repeat: GW1 did not have ewuipment templates. You said it did.
---
Tyrian time can be useful, but does it mean I can't see the current time if I want to see tyrian too? :&lt;
---
I think it still looks as loud as the old effect.
---
It is in the late notes now.
---
This is not a good example of Alacrity since other boons and effects are occurring with the unsheathe. Specifically the purple smoke orbiting the lower half the charr.
---
Only the iridescent jagged flames and grey cloudiness with it are alacrity.
---
The update to Deadly Strength to get +10 Power per stack of Carapace seems like a decent trade back though. But I’m also a casual running minion master in Open World and Fractals.
---
A character with infusions, or even with armor equip at all is not the best to show an effect visual.
---
Death Magic is toughness, thats pretty much all you get. There is one trait that is actually quite nice, but it doesnt come close to being enough to make the entire tree compete. You dont have to say toughness, but if thats all you get, thats what you end up discussing.
---
Lmao
---
The entire game is lines of code.
---
Also the the first campaign "Personal Story" is literally about a nobody going out from their home into the rest of the world. You know as much as your Character does.
---
In what possible comment did I mention Death Magic
---
Health helps against condition damage, where toughness and protection are absolutely useless (except prot with soulbeast). 
---
You can theoretically evade more with a dodge than with barrier, true, but you don't share dodges with others without even investing into it, right? Dodges aren't a infinite ressource either and most classes aren't able to cast while dodging (thats why for example mirage dodge is so strong). You can grant barrier whenever you want. Or at least that used to be the case until today. The problem with the patch is that you have no way to cancel shades. If you would have a button or if f2-f5 would consume the shade on activation (would need reduced shade cd most likely), it would be better. maybe a short icd before being able to consume it? 
---
At the end its a combination of many different mechanics that make you survive. Heavy damage pressure is a way to survive longer as well (thats why berserker is much stronger in pve than soldier or why peeling in pvp is important.
---
Guesstimate would be 400-500 gems per build per character. In reality I'd be willing to spend that much for a bundle of multiple slots, let's say 5, that apply separately to all characters on the account. Obviously there's a huge disparity there, like 50x for me with 10 characters, so I guess that settles it.
---
they definitely cheated. True, the background on the picture is more fitting and the pose is better too but there's a big pilar behind the chair that induces the player to think it's actually forms part of the chair.
---
I'd wish it was more like a dome, like the fire aura. But hey, it's still pretty.
---
Yes, and more fun.
---
not a buff to core necro unless you just want lich form burst. sustained dps is still best achieved with spite+soul reap+curses. (tested it all today)
---
death magic is shit.
---
must be, huh
---
well,its rainbow puke instead of purple flame...k.
---
That’s orders from above.
---
Why? For pointing out that people are saying "This could have been in the game since the beginning" have no real way of know if that is true so they are just talking out of their ass? Or the people who say "This isn't good enough" just sound like whiny, entitle, jerks because they are complaining about getting what they wanted?
---
How about raid DPS DGH with perfect inscriptions? That's a sigil swap. How about PI without spotter? sigil swap plus gear to make up the difference, or rune swap to Thief runes. How about Radiance healbrand? Tank healbrand?  Virtues Dragonhunter for Cardinal Adina? Maximum aegis spam Firebrand for River of Souls?
---
Rip my karma
---
Why the double post?
---
And yet all the things that cost real money are optional to playing the game. So if someone spends their rent money on it, kind of their own fault.
---
Do you then have multiple of the same profession and ascended gear for each of them?
---
Assnet will always be trash.
---
How's Axe/Shield Firebrand and Pistol/Pistol Thief, nowadays?
---
I agree with this sentiment however I'd say build templates should be really cheaper (per character) and equipment templates should be around the cost of a bag slot since it's around the same amount of storage. Maybe 100 for a build template on a character and 200 for an equipment template. Build templates as they've outlined is so minor that if they price it any higher than that it would annoy me significantly.
---
And if mounts did the same, but charr and some norn players get to be stuck looking ridiculous. Mounts and chairs are fun and all, but is it really so much to ask that I can get a mount that isn’t smaller than I am? I feel bad for those things.
---
Ironic.
---
Looks like CoR no longer goes for the target, it goes wherever you're looking/walking. Such a great functionality in zerg fights.
---
On top of that some or all sections regularly disappear on all kinds of terrain.
---
Can't tell anymore if those are bugs or features.
---
&gt; Now cancers can force others in stupid (and extremely long, due to abuse of stealth/movement skills) fights that they don't want.
---
Why do you even go to a PvP mode if you don't want to fight honestly
---
I play with one guardian and i don't want to roll another.
---
I have max bag slots, infinite tools, and i don't have any shared slots besides the free 2 (because i mostly play this character).
---
Also i have 100% completion on story and all maps.
---
Then i have an alt thief, also with max inventory slots and infinite tools. Also with 100% on story and maps.
---
Then i have a slot for weekly keys, a slot for map completion, and a ranger mule. I don't need or want more characters.
---
You could try spelling the word "monetized" correctly before posting your unwarranted outrage.
---
Personally I like the idea, but those greedy Koreans at NC Soft will probably monetize the duck out of it!
---
It's sad how people will fantastically defend Abet from all criticism whilst simultaneously missing the whole fucking point.
---
the problem began when u paid real world money for a fake game CHAIR
---
Scourge doesnt have the heavy damage pressure other classes do because other classes can eathier wait it out by running away and back in with more mobility or can activly defend the pressure with defensive abilities or just keep the necro locked down with cc's
---
The fact that necro ONLY gets 2 dodges and doesnt even have the option of choosing an evade on any of thier skills already puts them way behind every other class in the game defensively
---
Yet to see any criticism. Just whining and entitlement.
---
453
---
I use 2 to 4 builds on my Warrior, depending on situation.
---
1 on my thief
---
2 on my Ele (I have 2 Eles anyway)
---
That's it. Having equip stored will be the big deal for me.
---
Yeah my bad, was only thinking from an instanced pve perspective.
---
The others dye, why wouldn't these?
---
Uhm.. Its third party. 
---
I've seen a couple of comments stating this exact thing: that why should Anet be charging for additional templates when arcdps is free. 
---
Correct me if Im wrong, but if the creator of arcdps were to attach a monetary fee in exchange for the software, that's grounds for some legal trouble.  They literally can't.
---
I'm not good at WvW, but shouldn't you *expect* to lose if you're being chased by four opponents?
---
RIP pop scourge
---
I'm so glad they made this change. So many juicy carebear tears on forums and reddit! YUMMY!
---
Who says I paid for it with real world money?
---
Gold to gems is a thing.
---
They aren't quite comparable imo.
---
Honestly I hate many decisions Anet has made in terms of balancing and every balance patch makes me wish death but the game is way more balanced that many messes of games that you can find out there.
---
There's still a lot of room for improvements tho.
---
&gt; Warclaw: Added a new skill called Lance.  
---
But when are they gonna add a skill called Justin Timberlake?
---
How can they answer a question that reads more like a statement/opinion/leading question? 😂😂 Like I understand  it’s frustrating to have these features finally come into the game and be monetized at that, but honestly how entitled can you be to expect something that was in another game entirely? We ultimately don’t know how these things are developed/prioritized, as well as the possible spaghetti code that they might’ve had to go through to implement this feature. Maybe it’s the concept of monetization that finally brought it into the game? It is a company afterall.
---
I imagine many of us were using arc to accomplish this. That will get removed as per the original agreement with Anet. That means what I was able to do before is getting removed and replaced with something that is less capable then what I was doing before and in order to restore the lost capability, I now have to pay. 
---
It is one thing if I had the choice and could keep using arc. As that is what I would do, but now using my legendary armor on my guardian for example will not be much more annoying with the new system.
---
even the pose is different and clearly made to fit that exact chair which is why he's sitting like a fat person in an airline seat  
---
Anet just lied, it's not a bug
---
Hmm, shouldn't a Charr chair be a big pillow they curl up on?  Or maybe a box they sit in?  ;)
---
It can be reliably dodged if you pay attention, so your best move would be closing distance so your target has less reaction time, which is good design tbh
---
Most of my characters have 2 or fewer builds, but they also don't get much play.
---
It gets interesting when you look at my guardian and mesmer
---
Guardian:
---
* Condi Tank Quickbrand
---
* Condi Firebrand
---
* Condi Quickbrand
---
* Tank Healbrand (doubles as WvW healbrand but with different skills and traits)
---
* PVE Dragonhunter
---
* WvW Dragonhunter
---
Mesmer
---
* Mirage
---
* Power Chrono
---
Boon Chrono
---
* Tank Boon Chrono
---
At least we aint at archeage/black desert levels, boys. That'd be hell paying to actually participate at the high end. At least here it's all convenience
---
Others have already advised you to check the wiki, so I'll elaborate on that a bit.  While in-game, if you're facing something you don't understand, feel free to type /wiki confusingthing which will actually open your internet browser to that wiki page.  If you want to know what a Destroyer is, /wiki Destroyer will show you.
---
But beyond that, a lot of the information really is out there in the world to find... you just have to find it.  If you see an NPC with a name, try to talk to them.  Some won't have anything to say, but others will happily talk about the background of their area, creatures nearby, or sometimes completely inane things.  On beyond using that talk interface, NPCs will often have voice-acted conversations separate from the visual interface that can show you even more information, or even just silly easter eggs (The leader of Penzan's Pirates has a certain song to sing, for example).  If you're just rushing through the game, you'll miss a lot of this background.  The game won't throw it in your face like others might.  But I can say that after seven years of playing, there's still plenty of conversations and dialogues that I haven't seen yet simply because I haven't been in the right place at the right time to catch them.  And for lore hounds, isn't that the sort of depth you want to have?
---
elite specs,fishing,housing allllll of it
---
GW2 player's tears.
---
They are the cheapest commodity to buy right now due to high supply, and I think I can flip them at a pretty nice profit later.
---
Nobody has ever been banned or will ever be banned for using arcdps

*wipes a tear from his eye*

Given the current state of the sub I read that as "rageguild". Whoops

Istan loot is limited to one run a day now for Palawadan and the Great Hall, so it's not farmed as heavily.  RIBA is still RIBA.
---
Dragonfall from Episode 6 is a new popular farm, so you can look into that.
---
Yeah... I forgot about that...
---
I'd like to hear a game that has balanced PvP, because I'm fairly certain it's not achievable.
---
I'm confused on build templates.. what is the benefit to account templates vs character? Just if you have, say, two of one profession?
---
And if you place your zerker scholar armor "into the equipment template", are you able to take it out and give it to someone else later?
---
That's a beautiful post.
---
You say that. But I see it as more of a QoL thing than an impactful feature. 
---
It isn't going to change how the game plays at all. Just save some time on those that have different builds.
---
I don't think Istanbul is great anymore but dragonfall is good by just tagging events and doing meta
---
That's a GPU error. I had that before and I needed to disconnect my graphic card and reconnect. It allowed me to install after a restart
---
Pistol/Pistol Thief is as one-dimensional and boring as it always was.  If you enjoy pushing 3 a lot and hoping that your target dies before you do, then it'll be just as fun as you remember it.  If you're expecting it to have gained depth or synergy between its weapon skills, then you're out of luck.
---
Pistol/Dagger has received some interesting changes, with Repeater becoming a flip skill on that weaponset that inflicts heavy bleeds and thus has better synergy with the condi-focused auto-attacks.  But even so, it's not meta.
---
ah, thanks for the clarification
---
If they don't make money this game doesn't exist by tomorrow. They gave something for free and also put monetization on it. It's just a quality of life thing. Maybe spend some money to support something you've played for thousands of hours
---
I only use a power and condi gear set on my warrior main, so that part isn't so bad. I'll be getting more inventory space as a result.
---
But since its my main, I use it for PvE, PvP, and WvW. I know the PvP templates won't be ready at launch (they can wait, literally all I need to do is load into the map and swap weapons atm), but having 1 build for each game mode feels bad.
---
With arc, i had builds for condi, power, memey heal shouts and warhorn. I had banner builds, pure dps builds, wvw roaming builds, wvw zerg builds for berserker and spellbreaker, a wvw build for dps warhorn support and another for range. I could even move my legendary armor onto him if I really wanted to min max runes (scholar or thief) and crit chance (with and without spotter)
---
I was looking forward to having extra PvP builds to quick swap to while we wait for everyone to ready up. I was looking forward to working warhorn into a WvW build. I was looking forward to making a silly support build for PvE to go with the tactics changes. But now its looking like I'm being reduced to 1 PvE build, 1 PvP build (coming soon), and 1 WvW build until I pay more. And I'd rather save up for more legendary gear than pay for arc basically.
---
 Hi being, I'm Dad!
---
Looks like  $6.99 Walmart special chair
---
I'd honestly just rather pay a monthly subscription and have these types of things unlocked by default than have these types of microtransactions in a game.
---
&gt; ... it dismounted the user regardless if it hits.
---
Yeah that would be the best thing, but it would not stop a 5 man gank squad. Since you don't have 5 dodges, and they have 5 shots.
---
Something something those worthless lazy devs :p
---
I totally feel you man. Hope your day is going great! It was a cold morning here in WA.
---
Ok, but you can't argue that the tooltip is wrong. When it says "this will recharge one of your equipped utility skills" it should recharge a skill that isn't charged, because you can't "recharge" something that is charged.
---
If you never used ARC for template management, I think Legendary would have just been for looks in the first place. It's not cost-effective much of the time, and the inventory space it saves is negligible.
---
And if you raid regularly you probably have enough raid currency to outfit any spec you please just about any time with full ascended gear. Because of this, I am not even sure I'd go for additional gear template slots over just additional character slots. That's how I've been "swapping builds" so far, is by having 3 warriors, 3 guardians, etc. That's my 3 "gear templates" right there and it's easy enough.
---
Same pricing structure as black lion keys sounds reasonable, or something similar.
---
Soulbeast says hello.
---
I think you are confusing predatory and completely optional. 
---
Also, at this point if they did what you suggest and charge for LS, people would screech, "I CANT BELIEVE YOU ARE CHARGING ME FOR SOMETHING I PREVIOUSLY GOT FOR FREE!!!!!"
---
Because as we all know, if you get something for free, you can get it free in the future forever. (doesn't seem to work when I go into shops and other retailers though in the real world though. Hmm.)
---
The main issue with gank squads is that one guy can keep you in combat while everyone else catches up. If the shot dismounts the user, then dodging a few of them means that enemies get separated, which allows for counterplay. If they only get dismounted if they hit, then it means they can just sit on me until one of them hits.
---
Dunno what's wrong, I ordered it from ebay:   
---
"Amazing Tribune Chair Charr Metal Sitting Animation Epic Legendary Fast Shipping"
---
Seems like people didn't want build templates exactly the way they have made it. 
---
Obviously people were expecting something at least as good as arc-build templates.
---
How convenient!
---
Getting caught is dismounted and dismounted is fine - the whole point of WvW is to encourage fights. 
---
The problem with warclaw is that it almost instadeath when fighting more than 1v2 as you have the other enemies using the leap skill into the fight. At very least the leap damage needs a major nerf, i.e. 50%+.
---
Leaps should be primarily used to finish downs, not cheese a closely matched fight.
---
This meme works as the perfect example of the brain process of an Anet Fanboy reading any sort of criticism, lacking in textual understanding.
---
The Olmakhan were formed and fled during the Flame Legion's reign and ran to specifically escape their rule according to their own records (they call it their own act of rebellion). Some of them didn't believe that Kalla's rebellion wouldn't succeed, and others wanted out of the High Legion life altogether. They started as a single warband and were joined by more deserters as they fled. It doesn't say which legion the original warband was from, but they almost certainly had at least some Flame members within them given their proficiency for magic.
---
is that awful sound it made before gone?
---
guardian has weapon skills that are ranged damage, dragon-hunter has a 1200 range bow with aoe on it.  Ranger has 1500 range and barrage persists after the casting animation and can hit behind walls without LOS
---
Meteor shower is risk reward, long cast time for a gigantic high damage long lasting aoe skill that yes can be interrupted and moved out of.  All of necro's staff and utility skills can be interupted and moved out of. only shade skills can't be interrupted.
---
Europe bud. English exists outside of the US too and it ain't always the same.
---
Dude, I feel you. People in this sub want to complain about EVERYTHING.
---
No he said that he forgot to write up the note and it was discouraged to make changes after deadline.
---
But I can dream! Seriously anet would make so much money if they’d complete these gemstore armors. I’d buy all the pieces I don’t bother with
---
Unless I've misunderstood: 
---
Character templates are like you inventory. Account templates are like your bank.
---
Assuming it's account bound, it should be fine to take out as it is now.
---
So they made the purple/pink fire... Rainbow? I withdraw all of my earlier complaints lmao
---
Plz provide pictures :p
---
Interesting perspective. Never viewed it that way.
---
Firebrand still sets everyone on fire and does it very quickly. Shield is a tricky one as it can push enemies away but lots of firebrand's skills require them to be quite close. Save 5 as a panic button and you should be fine.
---
Only if they catch you.  Just like the saying, falling off a cliff isn't a problem - it's the landing.
---
Yeah, I play Guardian primarily, with mesmer as a second, and have been dinking around with rev.
---
I'm not as excited as I should be looking at where the 'free' line is.  I'm nowhere near hardcore at this, and still have like 8 guardian sets in PvE and WvW.

&gt;# **10/01/2019—Late Notes**
---
&gt;## **Living World**
---
&gt;- Fixed a bug during the &amp;quot;Pass the flame from torch to torch to transport it to the upper brazier&amp;quot; event that allowed players to get the Sacred Flame Wielder effect before picking up a torch.
---
&gt;- The &amp;quot;A Concert for the Ages&amp;quot; meta-event will now award Iron Legion Keys only after successful completion of the concert.
---
&gt;- The game clock can now show Tyrian time. Go to the General Options tab of the Options panel and select Tyrian Time from the In-Game Clock dropdown.
---
&gt;- The command /time shows the current Tyrian time.
---
&gt;- The command /emotelist shows which emotes are unlocked.
---
&gt;- &amp;quot;Recovered&amp;quot; Charr Artifacts now have increased rewards: an additional piece of charr-themed gear, one of the four legion keys, and double the chance of receiving a Visage of the Khan-Ur.
---
&gt;- Fixed a bug that caused the Icebrood Saga reward tracks to reset daily.
---
&gt;- Fixed a bug in which Knife Tail skritt could appear in PvP matches. The ability to rally has been removed from these skritt.
---
And other MMOs have build templates that are monetized. So what's your point?
---
Don't fall for that meme.
---
There were definitely posts like this in almost every thread about build templates.  Nice one guys.
---
25 builds as a mostly pure WvW player. I only play 5 of these builds regularly but I have the rest more or less geared in legendary or ascended.   
---
Herald x4  
---
Renegade x3  
---
Scrapper x2  
---
Holo x2  
---
Guard x4  
---
Mesmer x2  
---
Elementalist x2  
---
Warrior x3  
---
Necromancer x3
---
Theory craft  suggests this would work well but the other problem is that there's just not a whole lot of bosses that use confusion well.
---
How many chairs could a Charr char if a Charr could char chairs? 
---
(Flame Legion obviously)
---
Unlocking legendary armor could unlock access to any stat for that specific weight and armor piece
---
Implying the "roamers" that use cheese builds are interested in a fight.
---
do you understand you are like the 1% o the players and most of us do not need so many sets nor they have so many sets ? 
---
3 build for character are more than enouigh. i do not belive u have really all those full set nor that u bring those with you or you keep in bank.  
---
so 3 are ok according to me for most players. who wants or needs more is pro enouigh to pay some money for the additional service.
---
oh and anet is not a noprofit company.
---
You need to re-read Martial cadence. 
---
Soldier's Focus partially recharges ALL of your equipped weapon skills when activated.
---
Firebrand is very strong in all game modes right now, with several different builds to use.  Berserker/Diviner's Quickbrand can spit out Quickness for you and your allies while wielding Greatsword and either Scepter/Focus, Sword/Shield, or the other combinations of those off-hand slots.  You can go for Condi Firebrand with Viper's/Grieving gear and burning everywhere, using Axe/Torch and Scepter/Focus.  Or you can set up a healing Firebrand with Harrier or Minstrel gear.
---
Daredevil is in a good spot too.  It's just that P/P is still as boring as it's ever been.  You can run Staff to dominate in melee, and Shortbow as a ranged option that has actual options for times that melee is too risky.
---
Yes and no. People will always bitch, but Anet caves in easier than US politicians to the demands of the military-industrial complex. That's the biggest problem. They're so afraid of offending any part of their population that they fuck it up for everyone. Like the Warclaw. Or raids. Or everything that's not open world PvE, really. That's the yes part.
---
The no part of the issue are the other is players and their unending and unrelenting toxicity towards everyone they don't agree with in general and casuals specifically. Exclusivity kills. Fresh blood is the most important resource of every gamemode, especially competetive ones. You can only strangle a gamemode for so long before it's only you and your three like-minded friends.
---
No wonder WvW dropped off Anet's radar. How is a dev supposed to sell to their boss the need of additional resources for their gamemode if literally *every single change* hurts the game as a whole. God knows even **I** would stop throwing good money after bad.
---
Of course Anet COULD tell all the rabid haters to go fuck themselves and that they're going to revive the gamemode no matter what, but Anet genuinely lacks the balls to do something like that.
---
It's a bunch of sparkles!  But if you can't spot that you can look at your buff bar too.
---
It's really bad example, as the confusion in comments shows.
---
Elementalist: Power DPS &amp; Condi Weaver for raids (2 gearsets, 3 builds in total for power tempest/weaver)
---
Engineer: Power Scrapper for Open World (1 build)
---
Guardian: Power DGH for raids (1 build)
---
Mesmer: Condi Mirage and power chrono for raids (2 builds)
---
Necromancer: No build right now  (0 builds)
---
Ranger: (my main) Power SLB (Raids/Fractals/Open World variants) Condi SLB (raids, two variants for iboga or lynx pet) Heal Druid (raids) Deimos Handkite (raid) in total, 7 armor sets would be required, but I have legendary armor and just swap stats and runes with arcdps, still have 3 sets of trinkets.
---
Revenant: Alacrene (Raids/Fractals) (1 build)
---
Thief: Power DD/DE (1 armor set, 2 builds)
---
Warrior: Power &amp; Condi BS, condi berserker (2 gear sets, 3 builds - could be more, I just don't play them)
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
After looking at everyone's feedback and looking more into it, I have revaluated my stance of "I hate that it's tied to the gemstore".
---
Instead, I feel like I *get* why the equipment slots are purchasable via gemstore, since it holds all your gear. But I feel like it's completely pointless for build slots to be purchasable. I would just save it to a note pad. Instead, I think this should be part of horizontal ingame progression, rather than gemstore bullshit.
---
The 3-6 "account" templates are intended for when other players link you a build for a class you might not be playing at the moment.  Say you're playing your Engineer, and the Elementalist you're playing with links their Weaver build that looks fun.  You can't equip it right now because you're on your Engineer, but you can save it to your account slots for later use when you swap characters.  Once you do that, if you like it, you can move it to your Elementalist's individual slot and thus free up the account template again.
---
They can also serve as spillover if you have a single character that wants four or five builds, but the main intention with it will be to save builds you're shown for classes you aren't currently using.
---
Anet took an official stance that they will never add full armor sets to the gem store ever again. So instead they add costumes and partial armor sets. GG
---
🙄
---
that's what i was already doing lol
---
&gt; Getting caught is dismounted and dismounted is fine - the whole point of WvW is to encourage fights. 
---
Well yeah, but see the whole issue stems from before the mount, the high-mobility roamer builds were able to choose to avoid a fight they knew they couldn't win.   Eg. 1v5 or something.   But non mobility builds, often those geared for zerging, were at the mercy of said roamers - they couldn't get away, nor could they win 1v1 (for the most part).
---
Then the warclaw came out, and all of a sudden zergers could also choose whether or not to fight, and the collective roaming community lost their crap, as if all of a sudden fight-dodging was created, not willing to recognize they were doing that all along.
---
So of course they screamed for a dismount skill, and here is the irony that has me laughing: currently while in enemy territory, when your mount is slower, a roamer could still run/evade from a group of players trying to chase them down.  Even if they could time their attacks to dismount the roamer, they could probably still evade and escape.
---
But now when a group is closing the distance, one can dismount with a lance while the others will pounce on them before they can escape.  The very thing they screamed for will ultimately make it easier for larger groups to farm them.
---
Funny thing is, before the warclaw zergs would ignore the odd roamer they saw in the distance; I myself saw it as a waste of time for 10 players to chase down 1 ranger.  But ever since their collective apoplexy and condescension, as if to suggest that I as a Power Herald shouln't try to avoid 1v1'ing a Condi Mesmer, but should just bend over and take it...well, now I have no sympathy.  They wanted fights, (only on their terms of course) and now I help to see they get what they want, even if it means 10 players stomp and siege 1 roamer.
---
100% false advertising.  They need to give you what the picture showed.
---
The "Underwhelming" is why people don't want to pay for it.  It should just be another little mechanic in the game, basically, and wouldn't even be noticed if it was.
---
A lot of people are comparing to gw1, but keep in mind there were no armor templates in gw1 (weapons, yes)
---
Because the Merchandise Collector achievement straight up imply that every single player in the game have to find at least 3 of them. 
---
There is no way that the current droprate is correct. I don't think that anyone will be able to complete such task at all. Nor now nor in the future.
---
I would have preferred a model-tight effect like Jallis stone form.
---
Well I have three warriors and not enough diversity between them so I'm set on that.
---
I also have two thieves and two guardians.
---
My one ranger only has two regular equipment setups (condi and harrier) and very few build switches.
---
So while I cannot give an exacy value, I think I'm good with what we are getting.
---
Uh no thanks.  I'd rather have fresh rich content, new features, QoL drops, and story episodes for free, and pay **only** for the number of build templates I require to play all that cool content.  It's not like build templates are only available as a separate purchase; if you own the expansions and are a current player, then you get build templates for free.  How fuckin' cool is that!?
---
And...
---
&gt;...each feature will make them more money if they sell them separately.
---
No shit, Sherlock.  We got a business school graduate here, folks! ;)
---
Please stop comparing new features in GW2 to those in GW1.  The two games are separated by many years, and the gaming industry has seen complete revolutions in pricing standards, monetization, marketing, development, hardware, and much more.  *GW1 had free build templates, so GW2 should too* is a naive argument in almost-2020.
---
How about this? - maybe go get a job so you can afford the occasional $5 purchase in the gemstore to - you know - keep the game up and running, so you can continue to bitch about ArenaNet's *predatory* business tactics such as "let's sell stuff people want, in order to make money."  How dare they... /groan
---
This is not an infusion. This is straight up a piece of gear that is required for an achievement. The players are supposed to find this items.
---
The thing about Reaper Fractal/Dungeon builds is they’re WAY better in disorganized groups than other builds that would be way better given a good team comp. Stuff like Guard and Ranger is no doubt really good for Fractals, however Reaper is insanely good at self sustaining and self buffing, so if you don’t have an Alacrigade/Quickness Firebrand/Chrono/Bannerslave etc. to buff up the group, then Reaper pulls ahead by a fairly significant margin. So is Reaper META? No definitely not. Is it a very good, easy to play, reliable “solo carry” for Fractals and Dungeons? Heck yes it is.
---
They are right, you know.  You come across as pretty uneducated using all caps and straw-manning.  Just saying.  You might want to re-assess how you approach an argument.
---
People wouldn't mind so much if it was just build storage on the gemstore. Since those are like bag slots.  It's that tabs cost gems and that we get very few tabs to start with.
---
It's been too long standing in circles. Feelsbadman seven years!... I refuse
---
I'd rather they making money on cosmetics than utilitys tho. That would be more fair, but hey, its just my opinion.
---
Charr chair should be just a load of all the clipping mashed together
---
That's the reason of why if you go to WvW to do this and then complain about changes like today's mount skill your opinion shouldn't be taken seriously.
---
And even then, PvE dailies are even easier, they're my way to go to get them done fast.
---
Those 24 account-wide build slots don't include the (three base, up to six) character-specific build templates.
---
If you've been playing GW2 since launch, to have paid the same as a subscription, you're at roughly 89,440 gems to break even. 
---
Which gives you, assuming you never bought anything on sale:
---
LW 2-4 (if you slept through them existing)
---
Full salvage o'matics
---
full home nodes
---
world boss portal
---
+10 character slots
---
max bags on 1 character of each class
---
15 shared bag slots
---
39k gems for cosmetics, or limited-time upgrades.
---
If you reeeeeeally like cosmetics, you might be in a hole based on those costs, but if you dont care about those, you're well ahead.
---
Boy oh boy asura r34 incoming Kappa
---
Everyone is on the moon
---
Anyone else getting frequent, totally random crashes?
---
but they like their game and love working for free as any sensible company do, arent they? /s
---
It's a good animation, but I'm not sure going full-on rainbow made it "less class specific". It now looks like what Quip's aura should be if it was an actual legendary.
---
Each character can have 6 personal templates.  Then there are 24 templates that you can make shareable across all your characters.  So each of the 9 classes can still accommodate their own builds for each game mode.
---
A) boon management is not interesting in this game. All boons are 100% on or nothing. It's silly, pointless make busy work. But I get it, it is good to have some of those, though I would like more CD's. But...
---
B) Alacrity is bad because of its effect. The game has to be balanced around having the effect, because any situation worth balancing must assume you would have perma-alacrity. If it was simply damage that would be fine, losing damage is not actually all that noticeable especially when, but it changes the speed of your character. Because the game has to be balanced around having it, changing the speed of the character makes gameplay worse most of the time, as opposed to better some of the time.
---
Look at it this way. Imagine if instead of alacrity, Slow was a permanent debuff always on your character unless specific characters used specific abilities to remove it. That would be insane. It is also what is happening now.
---
what do you get paid for coming to Anet's general defense? what motivates it? no one with actual control over anet says that it's either paid gem tabs or a sub fee, and the implication is misleading and indicates your confusion. If Anet's artists need to be paid, Anet can use the money they've been making off bank tabs, keys, skins and other gem store fodder since launch. you talk like you're defending the poor or something. honestly, you'd think people wouldn't need this spelled out for them.
---
Looks like nobody has ever visited a Macdonald's in their life. You think you're gonna get a burger like on the picture? Ha!
---
(That sucks, sorry this happened and thanks for warning others as well!)
---
&gt;Gear templates store gear so that's 18 slots freed up from your bags (mentioned as a justification for the cost when they were discussing costs)
---
So yes gear templates is explained but build templates behind a cost isn't or am I missing something?
---
I think this is the right way of seeing this, despite them being called "templates", they are extra equipment inventories.
---
&gt; Turns out inventory code is scary and they're not allowed to touch it. 
---
Well atleast we know why equipment sharing isn't a part of equipment templates.
---
They should make a vendor that will let us make copies of our legendary gear for the sole use of populating equipment templates.  It is kind of self defeating to have gear that features account wide use to increase build availability and another feature used for build convenience with it restricted to characters.  This would make equipment templates much more desirable for people that would otherwise have to shuffle gear around regardless if they have templates or not
---
Good they fixed the icebrood reward track, now can I get my 10 hours of deleted reward track back please and thanks?
---
Said 15€ because that was the price you wrote in your parent post.
---
I'm not totally against a sub fee either, just think it's silly to even suggest it considering the current release cadence of content.
---
Maybe 7€/month is something I might be willing to pay, **IF** we got 1 episode every 3 months, alternating 1 Raid and 1 Fractal with every release, and adding proper support to alliances development and PvP tournaments.
---
84€/year for 4 episodes, 2 Raids, 2 Fractals, and keeping WvW and PvP updated, wouldn't feel like throwing my money at them without getting anything in return.
---
&gt;Also² there should be an option to link build templates to equipment templates to easily switch certain builds, but with how limited everything looks, that's not gonna happen.
---
They're going to be working on having a single keybind for both a gear and build template.  If you want to do that you should be able to using keybinds.  Not at launch tho.
---
&gt; * Your account can have up to 24 builds that can be shared across all characters.
---
ouch... that's the limit **after** paying?
---
One question they didn't answer on stream is what happens to the currently automatic switching from live? Will it set my active build to the last active build in WvW when I join WvW? And when I exit WvW, will it automatically set my active build "back" to the active build I had in PVE before joining WvW? Because, if I understand it correctly, there'll be no more PVE, PVP and WvW builds. But maybe they still separate the active build per game mode.
---
I think it's not that bad a thing it's not there because you'd see "ping LI + Ping KP + ping gear" and if people don't like any of those pings, kick x)
---
It's probably not the reason why they did not but it could have been an "abuse"
---
Their answer was Spaghetti code basically
---
Guess it all comes down to how much money one wants to spend on it then.
---
I probably think too complicated right now and really need to try that for myself, but it looked very limited.
---
I speak with everyone in English.
---
Are there Dutch guilds? Yes.
---
Would I join one? No.
---
Why? Because I like to communicate with people of my server and want to be open to friendships, and not cage myself into a tiny comfort bubble of a guild.
---
Fucking hell
---
Not the 2 very prominent expansions and living world seasons that you need the expansions to play?  Nobody paid for those expansions either?
---
I think a system like that would make the most sense and make the value of leg armor more apparent with the template changes. I don't think they'll do it though :-\
---
well yes naturally. what i meant to say is that instead of paying the gems for bag slot upgrades, you can spend that money on a salvage o matic, and a bit of gold for the portable merchant (and a few shared inv slots), and that way you should be able to live ur life at 100 inventory slots without too much problem.
---
not much need these days to pay the 400 gems for a bag slot upgrade at all if you do it that way instead.
---
No shit? Damn, I need that snippet.
---
&gt; Anet approved it only with a stipulation that it would be cu 
---
Yes, under the stipulation it would no longer be updated once Anet's build templates came out. From what I remember, they didn't say "it's also going to be monetized btw". 
---
&gt; so why is this such a shock? 
---
Again, because not only is this a feature included in GW2's predecessor, it should have been included at the start of the game, and definitely by the introduction of legendary armour and all the stat-swapping interface clusterfuck that entails. Also, once again: because it has been provided for free already, at Anet's go-ahead. I'mt not really sure how else to explain to you that being angry I have to now pay for something I've been receiving for free is pretty reasonable and to be expected.
---
Also, to make it clear - I'm not just angry because it's free right now, I'm also angry because build templates are inarguably mostly geared towards more 'hardcore' players who utilise many different builds and probably have legendary sets. It's those players that now have to pay, presumably because Anet or NCSoft are no longer happy merely milking mount skins at 2000 gems apiece. 
---
&gt; $10 in gems 
---
Speculation
---
&gt; would you also work for free? 
---
Yeah, I'd absolutely work for free to create a tool as amazing and helpful as arc and arc build templates. However, I have 0 training in anything computer/programming related. Best I can do is create chatcovers lol. Also...I'm not sure how that's relevant, sorry.
---
did they fix Guardian sword 3 yet?
---
As it is now I've just been making new characters when an alternate build becomes too tedious to swap to.  Since I have multiple characters of each class depending on spec, really I would only need one or two alternate builds per character.  I know not everyone is an altoholic but this will be great for me, personally.  The only character I have now that is going to feel a strain on the buid template slots is my mesmer, and since I was thinking of making another mesmer this is still an improvement.  
---
People seem to be forgetting that you can still swap these things manually if you want.  For those annoying times where you're swapping from power/boon support chrono over to condi mirage this is a lifesaver, but if you're talking about using a build template to change a couple utilities and a weapon, is it so hard to just do it like it's always been done?  It takes like 10 seconds...
---
They didn't really go much into the monetization of this system.  As they were talking about gear templates the guy (whoever he was) mentioned that you can store up to six armor sets on your character, and each set is 18 slots... so that's a lot of free storage.
---
The builds can probably be explained by them needing to keep the lights on and the servers running.  Why are some mount skins $25?  Why are storage expansions $10?  They have figures that help them predict fair pricing for the community and their bottom line I guess.  We'll have to see where the price point actually ends.  Builds are going to be sold in three-packs so maybe 800 gems for three more builds isn't a bad deal.
---
GW1 had unlimited **build templates**. That you had to swap from a menu.
---
GW2 has unlimited **build templates**. You can swap as many as you want from a text file, and the ones you keep in game you can hot-swap at the push of a button. You can pay to be able to hot-swap more of them at the same time, or you can continue to just store them in text.
---
GW1 had no **gear templates.**
---
GW2 has 2 **gear templates** per character to start, and you can pay to unlock more. Each functions as up to an entire bag's worth of gear storage in addition to allowing you to hot-swap your gear. 
---
GW1's system is more versatile. GW2's is more functional. "Better" is a matter of opinion, but for the game that GW2 is, I think the GW2 system suits it better.
---
GW1 did not had equipment templates like GW2 have. NEVER. Even in PvP if the person who argued about that with me earlier come here. Not even mentioning that GW1 "templates" was a glorified notepad reader.
---
I was very happy with what I saw. Kudos to Anet.
---
The issue is that the three armour classes have different seams between the chest and leg pieces.  When making a gemstore armour that's universal across all armour slots, that will cause issues between the different weights.  The chest piece will go down too far on the medium armour classes, or not far enough on heavy.
---
So they can do all the other pieces for sets like Etherbound and Lawless, but they have to leave chest and legs out.
---
Heh, I *wish* I got paid for this, it would be much more fun than my actual job. I'm just the sort of person who gets touchy when people on the internet act like game development studios are magical entertainment machines that produce entertainment out of nothing, and only take our money out of spite or greed. Far too many people forget (or ignore) that these developers are actual *companies* run by and employing *people* with *lives and needs*, not to mention owners and shareholders who expect not just profit, but growth. The money has to come from somewhere, be it a sub fee or a cash shop or something else entirely, and while I have very little doubt that a lot of people at ANet would gladly give us everything for free if that was a practical option, it just isn't in the world of modern large-scale game development. Smaller indie developers can afford to give out all their updates for free and make their money on the resulting spike in sales of the base product, but that's a luxury large developers like ANet don't have.
---
what should i use insteadd for normal, blues, and greens?
---
&gt;Your account can have up to 24 builds that can be shared across all characters.
---
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA what a joke. at this point they should really say "pls just use arc"
---
Oh, I really don't know if it was gear template or equipment template.  I'd have to re-listen to get an answer for you.
---
While the tooltip could be better worded for clarity, it is not wrong.
---
Your comprehension and understanding of the tooltip is based on assumptions.
---
You can't use notepad for the gear templates. They aren't shareable.
---
That was a really bad dicision. Should have been gone for unlocking stat combinations instead of using the item. Exotic and above. Exotic per char, above account wide. This way you could easily link it. Also skins templates. Too bad they didn’t think this through.
---
They said it would be in line with other storage expansion prices.  Whether that's material storage, bank tabs, or character bag spaces... we don't know.
---
Yes the "Personal Story" is very much like a Choose Your Own Adventure Book. You aren't supposed to just read it once. Except instead of different endings you get different PoVs of what's going on in the world.
---
You missed the part where the pancake stand was set up on land that ANet owned, and they always planned on putting their own pancake stand there, but they said while they were planning their own stand that someone else could come by and build their own stand. 
---
And now, years later, when they're ready to build theirs, everyone is pissed because they thought the old pancake stand would last forever, when they were repeatedly told it would not. 
---
=X
---
Oh it's gear ones..I thought I read build. That sucks big time then...why would they discourage people to play multiple builds like that...
---
Wow that's.... Wow
---
We aren't. You get 6 for the vault, 3 for traits/utils and 2 for gear. The vault is capped to 24.
---
really? can you keep 100% quickness without boon duration?
---
Noticed in other comment, read the OP wrong.
---
I think its still meant to be a random utility skill. When i tested it with all utils on CD it consistently recharged one of them (when improv itself wasn't on CD).
---
Except it isn't since you're limited in your options
---
In fractals its good enough, dont really do raids
---
Wait you want to have your gear just be equipped stat combos instead of actual items? Because that is not how GW2 works
---
I don't have legendary armor. I have all the provisioner tokens but no armor yet lol
---
I would love that change though
---
I thought I read those, but I must have skimmed over that part. Might have to go back and take another look later.
---
so account wide I would have 3x70 total on the account (3 per character) right?
---
So I store gear for the 2 Armory slots that I get, can I store a third BUILD TEMPLATE pulling from the the characters inventory? Not sharing gear, just keeping it on one character? Or do I have to buy a third Armory slot?
---
I thought that said pull up a seat with new charr skin because of this screenshot xD.. I was about to think tyrians were going around literally skinning charrs.
---
I don't even play this game anyone and this post is still the most pandering fanboy bullshit I've seen since Fallout 76 defenders.
---
Your problem is not being shortsighted enough :p
---
Min-maxing 10 extra stats isn't going to change any fights. There's no reason why you need nearly that many.
---
Those are shared template slots only - mentioned under "max".
---
I will never forgive the 2018 extra life stream as it was the first place I heard baby shark. Seriously though this is a good cause and I'm glad Anet are doing it again.
---
Ah, yes, that shitty ArenaNet allowing us to use third party tool until they implement first party version, how bad they are! They should've never allowed anyone to make hacky version of tool everyone demanded, just because developing something that works on par of the rest of the game takes time. D'oh, how could've they done this! /s
---
Hey y'all,
---
I'm sure this is relatively google-able, but what exactly is the gear progression like in the endgame? I just hit 80, googled some decent "starter" sets, bought a set of Berserker's and a few others, but is that, like, it? Not that I necessarily need the game to be a gear grind--and apparently there's like certain amulets and whatnot that are needed for the later fractals--but is there any real way to customize my character gear-wise? For example, just cause it was fun, I got that set of armor runes that summons a fuckin parrot, and I'm enjoying having it on hand. Beyond that, though, is everything based on just picking the exotic gear that has the best stats for you and rolling with it? I guess I was under the impression that there was like a whole world of endgame gear that wasn't available in the Trading Post, but my friend said that's basically not true. I kinda just like making my character feel like "my own", and for all of GW's strengths, I've never felt that way and I guess I thought that the endgame would facilitate that. Am I wrong on this one?
---
Different conditions shine in different environments.
---
In raids Confusion/Torment with expertise is king.
---
In open world and fractals, Burning is far more effective.
---
What you are suggesting would be catastrophic in any of the competitive modes.  Your proposal would minimize the counterplay of condition cleanse while allowing Engi, Mirage and Renegade to set up condition bursts.
---
Better to just manage expectations better, and education your friends on the different conditions, builds, weapons, and which are more appropriate in different environments.
---
you're literally getting 6 templates for free thats plenty and if you really feel like you need more then thats on you if you think you need to spend the x amount of dollars to get it
---
Ok my idiot butt can’t tell if you’re agreeing or disagreeing with me 😂
---
6 for free with 24 on purchase. Which you then have to divide yourself in PvE, PvP and WvW. So it's still a major downgrade no matter how you want to put it.
---
&gt; Builds are going to be sold in three-packs so maybe 800 gems for three more builds isn't a bad deal.
---
A genuine question: are you insane? You're fine with paying $10 for the equivalent of THREE CHAT LINKS?
---
I quite liked sword/X for levelling. GS feels weird to me on guard, sword is a bit faster paced and you've got offhand options. Firebrand works nice with offhand torch, so you could go sword/torch while leveling to get used to the setup. Doesn't matter that you're mixing power and condi because levelling is a cakewalk anyway.
---
Unfortunate but that's not unexpected. Some things in this game are just stuck in place and have to be maneuvered around. Such a shame.
---
Not really ou only get 2 equipment slots...
---
The point is that legendaries will lose a lot of their value with this downgrade, from arcdps to a to this strongly monetized feature.
---
Ehm they seem to have messed up build templates and their excuse is often spaghetti code. They also said an engine update to use DX12 is not gonna happen. Do you really think ARM is in any way realistic? I would be happy if the would update the engine to make use of modern CPUs but this seems more than unlikely.
---
What does this even mean I don’t understand the templates fully, what is capped?
---
ANet could make legendary armor and weapons have no transmution charge to counter the multiple armors with equipment templates. With that they could also attach the transmog to the equipment templates if you use legendary armor.
---
I understood that part, no worries! Unfortunately, my mesmer's not the only character that has more than 6 builds. My necro, revenant, guardian, thief, and ranger all have more. I won't be able to fit everything... and as I gear more builds this will only get worse.
---
Its still pretty cool tho
---
Pull up a seat with *fuck you.*
---
Yes, but say WvW is template 2. If I edit template 2 for a second Raid build, what happens to my WvW build? Does it use that new Raid build, or do I have to change templates as I move through modes?
---
The monetization is in two things, mainly. 
---
Build templates, for the ability to hot-swap builds.
---
And gear templates, for the ability to dump gear in a separate "inventory" slot and then hot-swap between them.
---
If you think these templates are supposed to be used to hot swap between like individual pieces of gear to min-max your crit chance, you're barking up the wrong tree. I don't even know why you'd need build templates for that, isn't it the same number of clicks to just change one piece of gear from assassin to zerker or something?
---
Yeah it'll still work like it does now. The templates are not part of your active build. You can change your active build without touching a template. Templates are just for saving/loading builds. Moving from pve to wvw or the other way around won't activate a template. You have to press load on the template to load it.
---
Oh so fun. Not only do we have to place a shade, we have to stand in it AND we have a .50 second delay on activating our F1 abilities. I know you guys hate Necros but holy hell, this is just pathetic to play.
---
Apparently it's in the patch notes
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dbyepf/game_update_notes_october_1_2019_late_notes/
---
&gt;When this topic comes up, I often hear cries of, “but all of the outfits in the cash shop look way better than the skins you can get in-game!” That’s wholly a matter of opinion.
---
Umm...yeah, but saying it's not is also a matter of opinion.... You cannot quantify something subjective like appearance.
---
I'll just say this:
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Starborn_Outfit
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mist_Stranger_Outfit
---
It has been said by many that these two outfits look FAR more impressive than even Legendary Armor.  I would challenge anyone to find armor that you can earn in game, that has similar levels of particle effects.
---
And even if you could, my bet is it takes far more time and effort to earn those armor sets than it would to farm the gold and buy these outfits.
---
I don't like outfits at all since I like to customize my armor piece by piece.  But to suggest that ANET isn't prioritizing all their high quality aesthetics to the Gem store is just living in denial.
---
I absolutely agree.
---
But I fail to see how this has to do with the implementation of build templates in anyways. It's not like you can suddenly not change your traits and skills on the fly anymore, it's literally the same as before.
---
The clipping in those pauldrons is insane omg.
---
Yes. Around 17 minutes into the livestream Rubi mentions that it will be in the Gem Store, free for a month.
---
Just a small thing, it's be nice if the command could give the current open world time on top of the current local time. Mistlock Sanctuary is locked at 11:00 and it's not possible to see the "real" Tyrian time without leaving it.
---
So, I have a question. The 3 build slots for your character, not your account wide ones, are one for pvp one for wvw and one for pve, and I cannot change that? Cause .. whats the point then? The game already switches my stats across game modes .. I play all 3 of them, with multiple characters. The shared slots are not enough to accommodate all the possibilities. 
---
So you kinda have to use the shared slots as ways to store some build templates, like condi variant builds for pve, then swap in and out with the power pve variant , if you want to have one slot per game mode at least. And since these are character bound, man this is really way more limited than I hoped it would be.
---
Learn to do math in your head and realize that you could pay much less for these things than a monthly subscribed game
---
&gt;Can't wait to buy 15 different equipment slots just on my guardian alone to be able to continue raiding without the severe cancer caused by manually swapping full legendary gear.
---
Hey good news, they just added a check box in this last patch to make that easier.
---
&gt;  It's a PvP mode after all
---
Except its not. Its a PvPvE mode.
---
Phantasms do not have additional effects on self, and have channeling times.   
---
But you can activate clones when they have an additional effect, like Decoy, Mirror Images and Phase Retreat. 
---
Let's me be more specific:
---
* If the skill has a beneficial effect that only does something on self, and only under certain conditions (like self stun break or self condition removal), and also an effect that only works with a target, if should not require a target to be used, and it should go just on interrupted recharge if neither effect happens. 
---
So Decoy would still go in full recharge without a target because it always gives Hide in Shadows, but Mirror Images would go on interrupted recharge if it doesn't hit an enemy or break stun, since it does nothing without a stun or a target. 
---
Other examples of this would be Judge's Intervention and  Infiltrator's Signet.  
---
They should be usable without a target, but only go on full recharge if they shadowstep to an enemy or breaks stun, or both, but not if used and nothing happens.
---
I want to clarify I’m not agreeing or disagreeing here. Just thought it raised some interesting points.
---
You can change them, they're not locked to a specific game mode. By default, when it launches, these 3 will be set to your current PVE, PVP and WVW build respectively. You can remove or change them at any time (OOC).
---
Definitely, after experiencing FF.
---
Like you said, they're not perfect. No game is. If you think a game's perfect you're either delusional or your standards are very low, **IMO**.
---
One main issue I have (and will always have) with sub fees is the obligation to play. That's all well and true, but as a new player why wouldn't you feel that way? It's a breath of fresh air and you most likely will find yourself playing everyday or as often as what's possible for you. Then when you feel like you've experienced enough of it, just cancel. If you feel like you've wasted your money, why'd you try to play it in the first place? Free trials exist for a reason.
---
So far I'm loving FF. Content that matters, balance patches that make sense. But is it going to keep me occupied forever? No. One day I'll definitely cancel my sub, but I sure won't view it as a waste of money. I had fun playing it, so the money was well spent.
---
Yeah :D I've been doing just that since Grothmar came out, feels good to give back.
---
&gt;&gt; Can you use ArcDPS after build templates are added to the game?
---
&gt; Yes.
---
Not that it affects me. But you can't use ArcDPS build templates anymore once this is released.
---
Why is this even a question? It's a fact that we get much more gemshop outfits than actual armor sets. Hell, they even think it's worth mentioning a new set in big announcements like the last one.
---
You put actual items in shared inventory slots. Items that you otherwise wouldn't have a place for, wouldn't be able to use. Items are finite. You can't throw away an ascended sword because you ran out of space in your bags and then magically conjure up a new exactly same one, at any time, for absolutely no cost. Builds are NOT that. Builds are infinitely replicatable. You don't spend any resource on builds, nothing is added or removed from the economy by you retraiting your character. Even better, builds can be turned into literal text and stored in a notepad. How can you possibly justify paying $10 just to avoid pressing Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V? You have to be a millionaire for such spendings to be in any way acceptable.
---
You got the right size; the person in the picture is just super small
---
&gt; Min-maxing 10 extra stats isn't going to change any fights. 
---
Thanks for telling us how we should play the game.
---
The shared build slots and character build slots should be extremely cheap. How cheap? The shared I would pay 400 gems and the character should be account wide, if you buy one you get it on all your characters. 
---
The gear slots I don't mind that much, since they have other convenience attached.
---
I wanted to clarify I’m not agreeing or disagreeing here. I simply read an article that I wanted to share and here some feedback on.
---
Your wvw build will be as you left it last. But yeah, if you want multiple build templates to load for every game mode be prepared to shell out the gems.
---
Edit: just to clear up confusion for some people, your wvw character won't use template 2 or 3 as its build, it's just that when templates release, they will be populated with your current builds from pve, pvp and wvw. What you do with those templates is up to you. Changing template 2 won't change your pvp build, changing template 3 won't change your wvw build. Your build is only changed when you load a template.
---
Yes... you can literally count them. 
---
Armor development takes a lot of resources compared to outfits so they now prefer to make outfits
---
thats so freaking low ... guards and mesmer can have over 10-15 buils for pve alone
---
Looks like you're going to be paying for those templates but to be fair, we don't even know the prices yet.
---
Heh. Yeah that's what a lot of these feel like.
---
"You don't understand, I run 20 different builds on my guardian in raids!"
---
Bitch please. I'm absolutely confident you could divide those neatly into 3-4 general builds and then tweak from there if you don't want to unlock a dozen different build and gear template slots.
---
Yeah I've got like 7 for guard, ele, mesmer, and necro, 4 for warrior, 3 for rev and ranger, and that's only for pve. I'd need a bunch more for wvw and for pvp. At this point it feels so necessary to have all them that charging so much for build templates feels bordering on a pay-to-win advantage, and I think that's why people are getting so mad. 
---
At the very least they need to be VERY generous with them like in packs of 6-10 or people won't be happy with them. Really though this is something they shouldn't be monetising since other games don't. It should just be a built in feature.
---
Aint happening to me, i dont use warclaw lol
---
I'm not gonna pay a sub fee for 7 year old game. Make gw3 with sub fee, no problem.
---
1-3 each, have 12 chars so some Classes twice
---
Currently in LIVE, we have 3 separate builds already, being PVE, WVW and PVP. So I was just wondering if it would auto ACTIVATE the LAST active tab/build since I was last in this particular game mode. The tab might have been removed/modified, so maybe it will just keep the current active and that's it, or maybe it will keep the last known build from that game mode, no matter what you have in the tabs, or maybe it will be something else, we'll see.
---
sPvP is way too toxic, nothing will ever bring be back to it.
---
Good enough for 1/3 of a character.
---
\\o/
---
GW2's PvP sucks, but it's still one of the best if not the best PvP experience of all MMORPGss out there. 
---
Not a high bar to jump, since PvP sucks in most  if not all other MMORPGs, but GW2's PvP is quite over that bar.
---
That being said, while GW2's has its balance issues, the fact that all gear is standardized helps a lot. It's just not fun when fights are won with pre-grid and stacking stats. In GW2's structured PvP, all players have access to the same stats and equipment, leaving grind out of the equation, and leaving just skill and build-making.
---
But hey, the core game is free, and you can always try it.
---
I've been away from the game one year (again) and look how many are those now. They are breeding!
---
You are suggesting that the issues with GW2 are because of a lack of revenue, when reports have shown their revenue has been steady, despite not having released a new expansion in over 2 years.
---
Y'know what is good for generating revenue?  Expansions.  But they have different vision/plans.  And that is fine.
---
ANET isn't sitting still, they are adding more and more things to the game. The only problem is, what they are adding isn't worthwhile.
---
Just look at the recent past:
---
Vision - a legendary trinket that has the exact same animation as Aurora. You only get something new if you have BOTH equipped.
---
Legendary Runes and Sigils.  LOL
---
Ascended Cooking.  Not a bad addition, but didn't light the world on fire or anything.  Now I care about picking herb nodes wheras before I didn't, and I kill any dolyak/sheep/moose I see.
---
And of course, their announcement today of templates, effectively removing access to unlimited and free build templates and replacing them with a limit of 3 per character unless you want to pay.
---
ANET doesn't have a revenue problem, they have a quality problem, in that whoever is driving the bus is taking them down the wrong lane.
---
No way would I ever pay a sub. Ever. 
---
If Anet wants my money they can make expansions and put cool stuff in the gem store.
---
Typical Chrono main here ! I already left the game and happily play GW1 where I can store and swap my zillions build as much as I want.
---
Well said. In fact, most open-world PvE content can be played using nothing more than 1, V, and F.
---
Though I'm sure speaking the truth on reddit will lead to downvotes.
---
Yeah i saw they added in late notes now that they fixed it so i also swappe and hope for the best. What bugs me with the whole thing is not so much the bug it self but how simple it would be for A-Net to just respeond on forum on reddit that yeah guys we know about the bug and we will fix it asap, and sorry for the inconvinice. A few words simple words, few sec of writing and so much less annoyed players.
---
Imagine if raiders during a week did not get their raid rewards. Imagine the riot on reddit and forums and how fast A-Net would tell them yeah sorry we are working on it. But as soon as it comes to wvw and the most simple things it is like walking uphill in a snowstorm were ir also raining glue. It bugs me.
---
Not your fault at all it is just me throwing out a bit of frustration over so simple things.
---
And every day when i make my zaishen missions i miss it in gw2 after that
---
You have 3 spots available for whatever you want them to be. It's up to you to decide what you store in them.
---
&gt; And even then, PvE dailies are even easier, they're my way to go to get them done fast.
---
Daily Dungeon or Map event is easier than Master of Monuments or Mist Guard Killer? Well, Map Events and Guard can be a coin toss depending on the map and how many of your team mates are murdering camps or how heavily the enemy is camping.
---
Thing is, I'll go out of my way to leave people in peace and they'll still chase me down like my ass is worth its weight in gold when all they're likely to get is a bag with a trash item in it.
---
I will admit there isn't much that's more satisfying then finally deciding to engage some pursuer, kicking their ass and then leaving them in the downed state (note: not defeated) while I go back about my business, while they slowly rally. Sadly, I'm not exactly fully geared for WvW so it doesn't happen often, but when it does, I laugh.
---
Zerker (POWER, prec, ferc) for Power DPS. However since Quickness and Alacrity are so nice it is permissible to mix in Diviner's Gear (POWER, CONC, prec, ferc). Concentration is that that that increases Boon duration i.e. Quickness and Alacrity. Although everyone says try to get 100% Boon Duration. Even something as low at 50/60 is still helpful (for others and GW2 is a cooperative game.)
---
I really like the sword changes, it feels a lot better. I will say, though, that the roll back has an extremely awkward pre-cast on it that makes it feel pretty mediocre. If it was faster to activate I think it would be in a really good place.
---
Oh man also the xunlai chest, a lot of those can be found around Gw2.
---
I remember playing FA pvp gw1 with mm necro and you felt like on top of the npcs u had an army backing u up
---
As a casual, I might quit the game, because subscription gives me the pressure that I have to commit, and that’s going to take away the “chill” approach that I enjoy.
---
I work with what I have, or freely given, and I’m pretty content with that.
---
I don’t think any people in this whole debate is wrong, we all just think and see things differently, we have different priorities in life. If you don’t like something, speak up. If it can’t be changed, then you either leave, or enjoy whatever is there.
---
If, however, this kind of thinking is deemed wrong, and unhealthy to the game by a majority of player base, then a monthly fee will guarantee to solve the problem, the game will lose someone like me, a casual, but it will thrives on with dedicated community, finally realizing its fullest potential.
---
 I din't see things fixed when they had $$$ in the bank. What makes you think After 7 years of BS a subfee will ....?
---
You only had it because Anet let you have it. This was the reason why. because they were planning on making this system and monetizing it. This was merely authorized as a stopgap.
---
You would have *nothing* if they said so, but they didn't.
---
Yeah this twitter post was little crazy, it was in the late notes before he made the "apparently" tweet
---
1 build. I ain't no bitch.
---
At least pretend to not be garbage and say PvP.
---
Luckily, firebrand has some beautiful ones!
---
How to get effects???
---
without paying, you can store whole 2 armor builds. sure, you can still swap the stats, but at the same time this will always instantly also overwrite your currently active gear build.
---
&gt; literary
---
Even worse - Chrome spellcheck.
---
&gt; On a sidenote: voodoo code has been this game's bane since forever. It feels like Anet has to spend half their time completely reworking everything from scratch everytime they as much as want to implement a new icon at the wrong place.
---
I've had to keep a handful of websites up to date since I made them around 2006. Adding any modern feature without breaking everything else that's been put there before, keeping the links intact etc., while trying to meet the everchanging standards, is an absolute nightmare. Sometimes it's just easier to break old stuff down and rebuild it from scratch since times changed and then retrofit it back into where it was and slowly phase it out...

When the dev was talking about all those edgecases, I physically felt her pain. And mine was just simpler websites, not actual serious software that people pay for which handles their hard-earned data =/
---
Its server vs. Server. You generally follow a commander around and take various holds on the map to gain points. What server you're against switches up every week. 
---
If you enjoy pvp but on a huge scale, WvW is a great spot to be.
---
Agreed, whoever leads that shit does it terrible, and still I see people defending them with "but mmos cost money". And I'm sure they get a shit ton of money from the gemstore, possibly more than from a sub fee. But wouldn't it be cooler if all those resources in the gemstore went to actual ingame rewards and gamemodes? I know that GW2 doesen't lack funding but I believe the gemstore is just a huge "fuck you" sign
---
Well then fk me.
---
I for one am very happy they are adding this. It felt so weird when you have two warclaws running next to each other on different teams with no real way to do anything to each other.
---
I also always thought it was pretty crazy how safely you could jump into a giant group on warclaws and escape. It didn't always happen, but that should absolutely be a suicide and now it will be I think.
---
Hello nice to meet you sir / Your daughter calls me daddy too
---
Not very fun having a host server that speaks a different language, is it? Not sure what Arenanet were thinking... Many people in that situation are transferring or just stopped playing.
---
* WSR is the ~~bandwagon~~ fight server, they are skilled but try to avoid T1 so they can farm more easily, so if you want fun fights you should avoid it.
---
* Gandara has lots of players, but many roamers, so it's a struggle to fill squads with proper classes.
---
* FSP is also active, but also struggles to fill squads. Many players just like to stand on the walls and follow comm around without joining or contributing much. At least the #1 drama commander moved somewhere else so maybe things have improved in that regard.
---
* Desolation was nice too but haven't played there in a few months, so not sure of its current state.

They said they doubled the drop rate in the late notes.

&gt; Zealot's Defense: Increased PvE damage by 20%.
---
At work anyone got a screen of the pauldrons?
---
The same as it was from the very start. The person suggested that people with alts will be upset over this, and i have alts more then most and i am not upset. So maybe it is about personal perspective. But i get that is a hard thing to grasp and easier to try and make it sound like the whole world stand by that suggestion.
---
Either way this whole post is a shit storm blown out of proportion and full of whininers who do nothing but that. And i bet you the time Arena net give all players 100000 gold for free. There will still be the very same shitstorm creaters there who will for sure create something that makes it bad. 
---
I can't really take this crap anymore it annoy the hell out of me so i quit the topic and all other topic full of this cry babies. Have a nice evening.

For raids? Boon support chrono (since you're taking shield)? In general [this is the suggested build](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/power%20boon/) but if you're learning chrono I'd suggest getting some more diviner and aiming more towards 80% boon duration instead of the ~60% recommended. [Jaffa also has a video guide](https://youtu.be/H1154AbvI34) on the general boon chrono rotation. Also of note, if you need to be tanking you should have options to raise your toughness up to ~1300 (to go past firebrand's 1250 and condition weaver's 1270). You can get toughness by replacing berserker with knights or using tankier options like minstrel or givers.
---
They need to figure out a way to make it so that having lege armor isnt just a waste. The value of lege gear is getting a serious downgraded since it becomes a PITA to stat swap without arcdps (unless you want to waste a template on maybe just a few minor changes like sigils for the same general build).

---
They probably don't play that much because they have responsibilities they cannot abandon, especially if they have kids and job. They also have (by average) more money than players who spend more time playing game so they are more likely to spend it on game.
---
Source: I am one of those. I am not "disgusted" (like some user said here) at all by this template stuff. I was like you before (being so invested in game and complaining about changes) but then reality hit hard and it changed.
---
Why would anyone buy the skill/trait slots if you can just copy+paste?
---
Wait, nevermind. Better shut up, less they notice and we can't even use txts lmao.
---
Was my 3ed character if I am not wrong. Took sometime to learn how to play it. The constant blood sacrifices and spawns you have to do is what made it exciting for me (my main was a healer monk). 
---
Vaguely remember it was capped at 11 or 12 minions? I was an army of my own. Good times.
---
...that's literally the problem. you don't get to give sth for free and suddenly start charging money for it. it's fucked up.
---
mind you wardrobe system was completely free, ascended crafting was free, pvp build system was free, traitline rework was free, probably many other features i forgot. and those were things we didn't have before. this is a thing we already had and now they reintroduce it with better UI and make us pay for it. 
---
stop licking their boots
---
Ofc sub fees have their own problems but the thing is, in FF i feal like, yeah, I paid for this game and can get almost everything while GW2 feels more like a glorified f2p mobile game next to it. Which is a shame given that the combat, fractals and raids are really cool.
---
I do want to step in here and say that on this particular matter, Lon-ami is correct. After the admin team had decided to ban Lon-ami we reviewed the discussion that had gone on in the Discord and were disappointed in some of the comments that users, and in one or two cases an admin, had made during the conflict. Some of those offending comments may have been deleted after being called out. There was a message pinned until recently reminding everyone that the wiki has a rule against personal attacks, and that we expect it to be followed on the Discord as well.
---
We should start with 3 equipment slots by default, 2 aren't enough. I think that's a good enough compromise, and would cover most game modes quite nicely.
---
I don't think it's worse than other software, no. If you have a piece of code that's existed for several years and you don't have supporting architecture (unit tests, design patterns) to help you change it in a lower-risk way, and if that piece of code is a critical thing that breaking would be Very Bad, it's going to be a nightmare and no one's going to want to touch it. People will be more likely to code around it instead, which does often make the problem even worse the next time some other similar issue comes up. This isn't really unique to GW2.
---
Most games with a gem store make more than a sub fee. It’s a management issue not lack of resources.
---
Good at monetization? There are far better examples of TRUE f2p monetization that went right, like Path of Exile and Warframe. And those two don't even need to pay for expansions, yet they release far more and far better ones than those in GW2.
---
There is a simple way that GW2 can make money: release more expansions. It's basically what keeps MMORPGs alive. WoW does that. ESO does that. Albion Online is doing that nonstop since they went F2P. If we have more content (and I mean, TRUE content, not a living story filler for an never comming expansion), we will buy it. It's simple.
---
[what?....WHAT?...you ok?](https://i.imgflip.com/3c3tky.jpg)
---
aww geeze, you guys are even more crazy than the r/DotA2 community. aight gonna see myself out
---
Ahh, good to know. Thanks for the advice!
---
that doesn't have to do with alacrity itself but with cooldown alignments and how combat feels more fluid when given the boost, applies to quickness too.
---
So rather than criticizing the consequence you could look at the source.
---
Here take my upvote dead nekro friend. The limit on death nova „kill a enemy on xp“ is so useless and make the death magic trait useless in high end content
---
fractals?
---
ok good, at least theyre not gonna sit on it not being what its supposed to be. like warrior shouts
---
FF14 (the elephant in the room on the sub thread) puts a crap ton of crap on the mog station....
---
By who? You already stated gandara is full to the brink yet unable to field any decent group because they're all roamers. AM is the german version of gandara. JS is the french version of gandara, but can atleast try to show up when the french guilds decide to carry them. Each of these servers is handicapped by having 90% solo-oriented players with no interest in builds, group play or teamwork making it impossible to field a group that can actually perform against non-trash. 
---
Which two servers in T1 are capable of making a group of players that will doubleteam? Or are we talking about WSR being so bored with nothing to do all week they'll push an EB keep with frontline tanking 15 acs and 50 players on walls; backline getting pewpew'd by 60 gandara roamers?
---
&gt; Thing is, I'll go out of my way to leave people in peace and they'll still chase me down like my ass is worth its weight in gold when all they're likely to get is a bag with a trash item in it.
---
Killing and stomping enemies gives points to your server, and if you forgot about it while doing your dailies, WvW matches are played by servers who try to beat the other two at the end of the week.
---
Delta has no obligation to maintain arc, he does so our of the kindness of his heart and I'm sure we all appreciate his efforts. The problem is that he should not have to. The obligation is entirely on ANet, and its only because they've don't nothing that arc was developed.
---
So, the question is, how much are templates worth? I would say nearly nothing, and it seems that many in this thread would agree. No one wants to pay gems for something that should be free and has been effectively free.
---
Thanks, I found his Reddit account and confirmed it. Hopefully this is something that ArenaNet gives him permission to continue to do, because otherwise it just looks bad with a shift to something with significant monetization. It's not like people wouldn't pay for it anyway , like they do with the crafting discipline increase.
---
But then again, this involves the people who run the gemstore who are now closer than ever to NCSoft's behest, so I'm not holding out any hope.
---
Adding a subscription to a game is a surefire way to make me stop playing it.
---
I don't play WoW anymore, why? Sub. I don't play ESO anymore. Why? There is a sub involved which adds QoL that really shouldn't have to be payed for. You couldn't PAY me to play FFXIV, why? Its a sub game.
---
My buddy msged me about build templates last night. I was pretty much removed from the game, especially after watching the very underwhelming "event" they streamed about season 5 on twitch. The build templates got me pretty excited again and had me considering coming back, but nope, after watching the stream...disappointed yet again. Rather give my money to other companies that are more deserving.
---
Everything in the gem store is optional
---
Sadly, wasn’t endless... it hardcapped at 25. But with adrenaline mushrooms and lich form back then, you hit 25 QUICK.
---
Lance for the warclaw is actually a great feature
---
They said that might be a feature in the future but after this patch we ll have to manually swap when changing game modes.
---
Yeah ik. At least they have free build templates lul. Most of the stuff they put in are little extra event items and stuff like swimsuits and I think that's fine since the coolest looking stuff is still obtainable in the game itself.
---
That is pretty sad.. I'm sorry for your loss. Best advice I can give is to roll an asura, that's obviously the race your current seat was crafted for.
---
I don't get why it always have to look like you need a shoehorn to get your Charr in to the chair. Why can't they do a big ass chair for charrs. 
---
I realise their neck likely makes problems but still charrs stand straight when doing cross arms emote so it is possible to straight them out a bit and make a more comfortable look on them without shoehorning them in to the chair. Or so i wish for anyway :)
---
I personally enjoy the permanent contracts, a few cosmetic items, and unbreakable tools
---
Sweet because I'm on a holiday until the first week of november :p
---
I mean honestly, it's cool when you want to try out stuff and have a bit of inventory compression but before Arc build templates it was waaaay more annoying to swap a leg armor stat+runes than to just having to swap an Ascended armor set.
---
Just like with Legendary Rune, that fact there is no support for it in the current Arc template (for very good reason since the offical one is coming soon \^\^) the set I made is nicely sitting in my bank because it's just so much annoying to change them manually compared to using regular runes on a leg armor with Arc template.
---
No what they should have done is made build templates years ago. And what they should do now is not beeing greedy little goblins and trying to squeeze every last cent out of their long time users before they jump ship.
---
Which is why it would suck for us. GW3 would be cross-play mobile micro-transaction heavy etc.
---
It's cheaper to join a linked server with medium population than a host server with very high population, so I'd suggest give Ruins of Surmia or Vabbi a go so you can play with Gandara or Desolation and see how you like them.
---
So if they're worthless, then do without them! Simple solution, have a wonderful day.
---
That's funny to think that raids are actually hard content. Try playing against something with a brain, like PvP.
---
I like how you tried to use big words to make it sound like you know what you're talking about but you're apparently too ignorant to know that Cheat Engine is a memory editor not a packet sniffer/injector.
---
So yes, you're very ignorant about computer security.
---
Do you want to have a rational discussion about this, or do you just want to use hostile language and throw a fit?
---
i'd prefer to not have a sub fee because in my mind all that will happen is gem store will remain the same and you have to pay a fee to simply play the game when you want to.  there's no incentive to cut back on the gem store whatsoever, that's just extra money on top like with how WoW's shop works.  if they were to put more of the gem-intended items in as earnable drops/rewards then we'd see the same sort of grind complaints as with any of the newer collections that have some sort of nice reward (skyscale, astral/stellar weapons, inquest backpack from sandswept isles, dragonsblood weapons, aurora, etc).  
---
Would i like to see at some more mount skins added as in-game earnables, sure, but i also don't have a problem accumulating gems from gold conversions and misc black lion key farm rewards since gold is pretty easy to come by.  As it stands i think asking about a sub fee is a "be careful what you ask for" question.
---
So quit then.
---
I'm sure the whole community will miss you deeply.
---
I'm sure we'll still get new, dedicated MMORPGs, it's just going to go back to a reasonable level now that people have stopped trying to reproduce WoW success.
---
Seriously, there are far worse and less fun quest lines in this game. The hate on skyscale questline is basically a meme by now.....
---
300 extra of a stat isn't going to change a fight. The only thing I really agree with is that yeah, having a cap is pretty dumb.
---
Yeah I've got like 7 for guard, ele, mesmer, and necro, 4 for warrior, 3 for rev and ranger, and that's only for pve. I'd need a bunch more for wvw and for pvp. At this point it feels so necessary to have all them that charging so much for build templates feels bordering on a pay-to-win advantage, and I think that's why people are getting so mad.
---
It took me a week to do the skyscale quest and that was before it got nerfed. It's fine. And I never have to do it again.
---
New players didn't get interested they got the Warclaw then left WvW, exactly as I and many other predicted.

&gt; Hey all. Just got the news a few minutes ago. We're a go to run a "monthly" tournament this Saturday October 5 at noon PDT. 
---
&gt;A few notes. The tournament infrastructure still has some big flaws to fix. What we've done for now is gotten more robust tools to try and resolve issues with the tournament manually, should they come up.
---
&gt;Even given all this, I want to be clear that there is still a chance something could go wrong that we're unable to recover from.
---
&gt;We're still in progress on the full fixes we need. Expect to hear more about them in the future.

Glarpsnog Foodeater sits.

Omg so much bs written in this thread. The issue was never about being able to gank. The issue is by far more trouble then that. You have very capable players who are able and willingly to fight. But they all run lazy and simply just move around and cherry pick. Why is this a good thing for WvW? 
---
Or why should enemie zerg have players sitting on their mount feeling safe and then stomp enemies in zerg being downed without having the possibillity to stop them? How is that making fun for WvW players?
---
How is it ok that you chaise enemies around the border who apparently are capable of taking camps, towers and sentrys but refuse to get of their mount to fight and you having to run around the border over and over because they can create gaps get out of combat super easy and mount up even if i have bleed stacks i watch the thief mount up. Why is this ok and how is that making happy wvw players?
---
How is it ok that a person on a mount can contest waypoints just by using their mount and nothing for us to stop them? 
---
I can keep on counting on probably 20 more of how is it ok, whilst you only see one reason which is ganking. WvW is way more then that and it is actaully not us the WvW players that are our worst enemies, it is the players who do not really understand WvW that is.
---
or overhaul how items are represented in the game engine ... but that would be a huge amount of work
---
I never understood the whole "Sub fee means no gemstore" thing
---
How is paying for a gemstore item worse than paying for the ability to play the game and then having that ability taken away after a month?
---
Nope, they did actually say that you can't change anything about your build or equipment templates while in a PvP match
---
&gt; (I actually have a gathering template.)
---
Hey, I just have a gathering *main*!
---
^I ^mean, ^what ^else ^do ^I ^even ^do ^after ^all ^those ^nerfs...

So, this feature has to bring some value to the game. While raids are an important part of the game for a set of players, and is a valuable part of the community, it doesn't seem like it brings in enough players/revenue to justify spending many resources supporting it. This is evidenced by... A lot of things I'm sure you're more familiar with than I am, since I don't raid.
---
So, with this new feature, the 80-90% (totally a made up number) of players that don't do raids will very likely barely use the featute - maybe grabbing 1 or 2 slots on a main character or something, so this brings little value to them - so how does the company justify spending money building the feature? You ask the relatively small set of players that *will* use it extensively to please pitch in to cover the cost of building it.
---
Tl;dr: this feature (probably) doesn't really sell the game to many people, so it needs some other monetary motivation or else it would never happen.
---
didn't they also say it will be sold in lots of 3? so even if the price was the same as bag expansions (which it wont be) you need to buy 3 of them at a time
---
Yes Zietlogik is right I meant the engine. 
---
And you are right too, it's controversial. 
---
I know i'm wrong with a bad example. 
---
It was just a very easy, no effort and simple way to share my point. 
---
I'm glad we got build templates and i'm happy we'll have it soon. I didn't expect it. But i'm really frustrated with the number of builds available.
---
Please don’t get this wrong, but maybe, from my point of view, GW2 isn’t the game for you then. Your definition of rewards seems to differ from mine, and because of that, you are never going to feel rewarded in this game, and I’m not even talking about buying things.
---
Upper limits?
---
But if they pay you to play FFXIV then you lose nothing
---
Only reason I visit this sub!
---
"greedy little goblins" isn't truth, it's non-constructive opinion.
---
Thanks for these explanations. Really. (-:
---
Galaxy bikini isn't really all that good though
---
I lose a fuckload of build / templates I made in years of playing each class with every spec in different games mode!
---
I'm gonna login, insta loose all my flexibility, having to decide if I want to spend a fuckload just to have less than the day before while wasting days to recrate all those builds and that fine mix of gears that was working well in that situation.
---
Number of builds a character can have
---
The chat codes can be saved out into a text file, so the in-game Build Storage and Build Templates are for convenience.
---
Not deroir too D:
---
For PVP, yes.
---
In GW1 equipment wasn't so unnessary overcomplicated as in GW2. If you switched builds dramatically: you usually had to change your weapon + head piece of armour. That's it. Two pieces vs. 14 in GW2.
---
As example a heal monk is wearing a healstaff and a headgear (+1 on healing prayers + heal rune in it). To switch to smite monk he'd switch these for a smite staff and a smite headgear.
---
You are talking about losing access to things given to you by a tool that does, and has always, violated the ToS, and you were granted a temporary waiver while a permanent solution was created.
---
From Iron throne to the manspread-chair 😬
---
Could you possibly find a tiniest hill to die on?
---
Equipment Templates are character specific because of the way the game and database are coded. They made that clear in the stream. Equipment templates also can't be shared due to the same reason as a character's gear in the game is tied specifically to a character in the Database. Changing that without potentially breaking a ton of crap is damn near impossible
---
At release I didn't care as much but as it stands currently is that pretty much 90% of the QoL things are monetized in the gemstore. Sure you can convert gold to gems but the rate is so abysmally high that I just can't afford it.
---
I would not ming the mount loot boxes and gem store skins if we could have complete features for free or low price.
---
Game is great, don't let that stop you from enjoying the game, but yeah... it's getting more desperate and ridiculous...
---
As another Dota 2 player, I agree that I bought a lot more skins as I didn't have to pay for the game itself or the content of the game. I haven't bought any new gemstore skins in 3 years other than that supply drop.
---
I'm fine with the skyscale. It's acquirable in-game and makes it kind of prestigious, just like the griffon at first.
---
I just started this game, pretty cool so far! Im playing an Elementalist, asura if that matters. What should I pay attention to and what should I work towards?
---
Who?
---
Ah, yes, the classic "just quit" arguement. The reason why people raise criticism is because people care about the game. The people who leave silently are the ones ANet will never win back.
---
But you're right, I haven't logged in a while, and haven't bought anything in over a year, maybe I will end up quitting. Not a big loss, seeing as I can't really be monetized, but the tides will shift.
---
As it turned out you apparently can dodge it with a Guard.
---
Indeed ... you could just count. Most of us are probably capable of comparing two numbers figure out which is larger.
---
I have 75 builds for my revenant. Each with different stats, runes, traits, and legendary swaps. I’m so disappointed. Assnet is trash.
---
This system seems really crappy. Why can't they just let us store builds locally and as many as possible? The chat-code system even works similiar to that.
---
Chrono actually sucks now as a gathering main. Firebrand has much more and easier available quickness. I'm faster on my Mirage gathering my home instance than I am on my Chrono, thanks to Glyph of Reaping, leaps and Jaunt.
---
Oh how the mighty have fallen. Everything that was fun and unique is gone.
---
Ohhh okay haha thank you!
---
Thank you :D I am quite rusty still and found it odd to not being able to locate it!
---
Even if you pay it limits you to 6 build templates. (Which are even shared between PvE, PvP and WvW)
---
r/GuildRecruitment is also a good place to post this.
---
Also I don't have to waste my food when switching from power to condi
---
Drama queen
---
Well, I don't know if we're "good" but my guild &amp; I would be happy to adopt you. Msg LoliNoxTan.1264 in game if interested
---
You can have up to 6 gear templates and build templates on each **characters**, as well as up to 24 **accound-wide** build templates in a library of sort.
---
I just started getting back into fractals with scourge yesterday. This is fucking ridiculous, one day of semi-trying makes it obvious how important it is to be able to have shade skills at both your shade and your player
---
Because Assnet will always be trash.
---
Well longbow is definitely pretty useless in fractals, which is what I play most.
---
Axe and dagger are both DPS losses which is a bummer.
---
Are you using arcdps?
---
"Tons of people" doesn't mean everyone. Hell, it doesn't even mean a majority.
---
Wait, they're removing the extra ones per game mode and autoswapping? I was wondering why people were getting annoyed about having only three templates. I'd be fine having three to switch between if I still had the PvP and WvW ones as their own thing, since I usually just use one or two builds per class in those modes. But the only thing we're really getting is mainly the ability to use our builds from one mode in another...which is usually a bad idea anyway, or giving up those to actually have the functionality we were asking for, but only in one mode.
---
It's like Hearthstone's deck slots all over again...
---
I’ve been trying to branch out to other classes, so thanks for the suggestion!
---
These are at least worth opening now.
---
[me_irl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pl1LAr-Cd4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=8)
---
&gt; but in game you get the list of skills, traits, etc that are equipped so you know what that build actually has
---
I don't need any of this, when I can just give it a name. Which I can do perfectly in notepad as well.
---
&gt; It's not that big of a deal
---
It is for me, and it sure as hell looks like it is for a whole lot of other people on this subreddit.
---
&gt; especially after they detailed the amount of technical hurdles they had to overcome to get this implemented.
---
Excuse me if I don't feel bad about employees having to do work in order to get paid. Because that kind of the point. Any work involves hurdles that need to be overcome, otherwise nobody would be paying anything to anyone.
---
&gt; This was a 2 year dev process
---
It's both a tragedy and a comedy that this took them this long to overcome. I can understand gear templates being a problem, but builds - give me a break. That should be a few weeks worth of work, no more. But according to the stream, they spend on it all the time since April 2018 to the beginning of this year. 8 months.
---
&gt; this will just be v1
---
Nobody is going to allow devs to spend "2 year dev process" on a feature that will have to undergo more major changes later. Almost everything is set in stone at this point. There's not much that needs changing either, so I don't understand why you bring up this argument: the system looks pretty good. The problem lies in the monetization, and decisions regarding monetization are in the hands of higher-ups, not the designers and programmers that created templates.
---
I was ok with the time gate, the materials, the quest overall was fun. However I hated having to repeat jumping puzzles I've already done many times. It would be nice if they removed that part for normal map spots.
---
Can't make mylegendaries without WvW
---
The fact that the cap is 6 gear templates is laughable when i have over 10 saved on arcdps for my mesmer main alone. The money isn't the main issue. It is the fact that I will be forced to use a subpar product (even after paying for it) that is the problem. It seems like no one understands this very important point.
---
Just add random people in game ,so your friendslist is full and pretend you actually have friends . 
---
Works everytiem.
---
This honestly feels like it's a post on bad faith. People aren't mad abt build templates, people are mad at this ridiculous inclusion of monetization. If you think this is ok, great for you but I honestly think this is the kind of system which shouldn't  be monetized in this way. People who pay various characters and builds are forced to pay what in the long run might amount to more than an expansion's worth in gem value to unlock a feature, which I believe should be either sold in an expansion pack or come as a free quality of life upgrade, as it's been done in the past with the wardrobe system back in 2014, and many other systems so far.
---
Why would you assume that? How would they make any money off of that? That's the price of a character slot which offers far more for your money.
---
What if their reason is, "We need to make money to keep the game going and we're not asking you for a subscription fee and you don't need templates any more than you need the other convenience items in game so...?"
---
Only thing that is irritating about it for me is the rift mastery thing popping up when i'm gliding/on my Griffon, and I'm nowhere near getting to that part of the questline.
---
Yup. Anet's response to "Necromancer is doing well" is to crush it with a nerf bat. (Halloween 2016update is proof.)
---
They sure did, and they got 4 and 5 zones and a whole story to go with them!
---
A youtube and Twitch content creator, most recent I saw him was here on the subreddit when he had first solo kill of the new strike boss.
---
I mean if you categorise all complaints and criticism of a product as whining and entitlement, then yes that is all you will see.
---
There's plenty of stuff on the store that's "important functionality" for convenience.
---
OH NOES ARE PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET GOING TO THINK POORLY OF ME?
---
source?
---
The 3 scavanger hunts in Dragonfall are horrible and I would have never done it without a guide. "Somewhere in X". The rest is ok.
---
I definitely get that, but the fact that it's so limited (in terms of slots) is unnecessary, especially since they proved that they can handle giving more slots, but you have to pay for those.
---
The pure nonsense part was the fact that it has absolutely nothing to do with what happened here.
---
that's pretty neat
---
Tell me then: How do I get a gift of battle without WvW?
---
I think the big yellow bar over the health bar is enough to notice the barrier.
---
This will just turn into another 250 Li link very fast lol .
---
A mansplainer.
---
You're welcome. ;) Have fun, mate!
---
People will say, “Good, let the veteran/elitist leave”. The problem is, there has not been a new movement of content creators to take their places. Sure, there are new partners, but I rarely see anything that they have produced.
---
We want 3 and 3. Why don't they match? I need to buy 70 gear slots to match. I already paid 50,000 gems to get to 70 slots. That's enough. If it was, lets say, 400 gems for one more gear slot with 70 alts that would be 28,000 more gems. Yea that isn't gonna happen.
---
it's mostly those with legendar gear, and support role players minmax a LOT with BD and toughness. Others with critcap. What would make sense is require gems to unlock slots to put armors in. but armor stats+runes+sigils are saved under "build" template
---
Probably not?
---

---
A sub fee everyone has to pay would be more ethical but you can't really do that now, that would of been something you have to of had from the beginning but milking people dry of their money on things that should be ingame rewards is easier.
---
Having it be a place you can interact with, sun's refuge style or not, would be super cool. I just don't know how they would reconcile the fact gw1 players can already teleport there.
---
If they did do it refuge style like you suggest, it might be a little simpler since they could consider all the gw1 unlocks optional pieces of it for people that have them. Still seems unlike them to do that though.
---
/r/ExpectationVsReality
---
Oh wow, I stand corrected!
---
I never intended to villify you. I'm only making the argument that you are not losing anything built into the game, which was part the conditions of my response above.
---
The cap on builds should be easy to work around, since you can copy/paste text codes to import a new build.
---
Yep exactly. I work in the industry and it absolutely costs several million dollars a year for servers. And that's *just* the servers. Then there's the rent of the studio building, paying employees, power, etc. etc. etc. Now look at their earnings and you'll quickly realize that almost all of that money goes right back into keeping everything running. They're not rolling around in all of that cash.
---
The first order of business is to redesign the minor traits. It really feels like this change was rushed through, as they didn't even acknowledge the fact that the minors are mostly non functional now in pve. 
---
If the ability to place a shade is being re-emphasized as a choice rather than an always correct decision, they need to redesign the minors to something completely different. As it stands now, scourges in pve are heavily punished for laying down shades and the spec has moved mostly to being a melee PBAOE spec. Right now, we basically have no minors a large percentage of the time. 
---
I'd also like to see them have f2 and f3 still have their defensive benefit on the scourge even if a shade is placed. That would help immensely in terms of not punishing the player for wanting to play at ranged (and there are obviously many scenarios where it just doesn't make sense to be in melee range).
---
Ok I'll add u next time I'm on the PC thanks !
---
Active in terms of what though? 
---
ATM there are alot of open tag fights in T2 between WSR and Deso, but SFR seems quite dead compared. 
---
T1 has Gandara and Abaddon's, who are more PPT oriented but the former may have a few open tags now and again. The rest are in the lower Tiers, who might climb by the next relink and piken is piken, rather more casual, but they are full anyway.
---
😂
---
Tell me if I am wrong... It seems you can Chatpost the Buildtemplates to others. This must mean there will be some kind of Chatcode for every configuration.
---
Tactic No. 1: I store my Builds that I don't need that often in an Excel sheet and copy/paste them for myself in the chat to quicklyread them in.
---
Tactic No. 2: I store my Builds in the MotD of my Bank Guild
---
One Chair! One Chairrrrrrrr!
---
It's definitely geared to the hardcore OW-PvE players. In theory, that's not a bad thing, considering the other 6 mounts are relatively very easy to get. But it seems that the way it was implemented is a bit overkill, and is a rare case where it sacrifices the happiness of one part of the community to please another. The timegating doesn't sound too bad after the nerf (and wasn't even that awful before the nerf), but the 250 of every LS mat and repetitive collection achievements are really painful if you're the type of person to only have an hour or two to sink into the game each day and not have stockpiles of them. I'm currently only on step 2 since I put off getting started on this for so long and so far it just feels like a slog for a glorified flying bunny.
---
yikes
---
They would have to increase the quality of content in all the aspects first, otherwise they might shoot themselves in the foot.
---
You're right as far as I gathered.  Fringe builds can be stored elsewhere amd only store common builds for your characters in the system.
---
anet is a business and not a charity. they will not change their stance on something they want to monetize.
---
Will do . I have to make a new post tho right
---
I think they mean having that cooking station for home instances across all charters vs just the one that completed the collection.
---
So people do pay plenty for this game.  Not even counting gem store sales, simply on buying the game and expansions.  Stop assuming everyone is some freeloader just complaining about "free stuff".
---
Expectations vs. Reality
---
I imagine it will be like extra bag slots. You can't move those around.
---
Well I'd say the huge borders in win7 were the problem as they're the ones wasting space. But I guess anet hard-coded maximum dimentions for the game calculated from the side of the main monitor minus win7 border sizes, and didn't change when win10 came. At least it doesn't prevent perfect 1280x1024 windows on my 3rd monitor (which I use for accounts that mostly just gather dailies)
---
&gt; But needed in the, 'dps players need to have a power and condi option' sense.
---
Sure. That's still not 13. I have a power and condi build, or power and healer builds on multiple toons and that doesn't eve remotely reach that many options.
---
(shrug) I have options but I don't see the need to have so many variations of the same thing. Maybe in builds but not equipment.
---
Anet can keep making excuses for it, but the logic and veterans know better. Thank you for pointing it out.
---
Wow....that's.....
---
Wow that's really sad.
---
This is so sad, alexa play despacito
---
Wait seriously?
---
Server time on the left of the minimap, Tyrian on the right would be nice
---
Two people dancing around each other on their mounts for five minutes straight and the one still mounted disengaging when the other attacked was a huge issue and boring as fuck. I had to reset my WvW abilities on my warrior so it would show the "no mount use" icon to make people actually engage me again.
---
You shouldn't be forced to play some pew pew range build just to start a fight in a gamemode that is about PvP.
---
Good change
---
That's their problem, not my fault they wasted their money on useless shit
---
Let’s hope ANET starts to listen to the feedback and how people need build templates to work.  Right now I look at this as a #cashgrab and a wholly insufficient implementation in terms of number of builds/variations a character needs.   The costs involved will be astronomical for those who have many characters compared to a casual who plays one toon or so to three builds
---
&gt; gw1 also had weapon templates
---
No it didn't. Those were weapon slots just like in GW 2 only you could swap freely at any given time, even during combat. The other difference was you had 4 slots rather than 2.
---
There was a reddit post a day or 2 ago where they did a 3 mid burn on the game lady and the ranger used a LB for it. There was also a Siax world record kill where a ranger used a LB (I think) and the warrior used a rifle. Granted this is super organized, min-maxing, speed clearing, god tier players doing this stuff. Just thought it was worth mentioning.
---
Today I played a popular Moba with some guild mates.... I got called elitist for wanting to win....
---
That's a questionable bug to miss, even the posture is wrong.
---
You think GW2 is not micro-transaction heavy? Wow.
---
because he is **losing** the current, **free** build templates that are included with arcdps. what has changed is that he has just lost access to a superior, free system because it is competition for anets new milking idea. if you cannot see how the actions of the majority will still harm the minority then i don't think there is any hope for you.
---
7 years and we still don't have official meters in game to check buffs / debuffs damage taken dps hps .
---
But hey let's break Arc , just because we can some money .
---
This falls into the same category as siege ie. its not pvp, which anet yet again show they fail to understand.
---
I totally agree. I love that they offer a new skin as a map reward in the Prologue of Icebrood Saga. I honestly hope that they continue this trend, as long as the skins continue to look good (RIP Requiem)
---
11/10
---
Yea, i'm just fine.   
---
Are you?
---
scaling it on height slider instead of race is next level amateur coding
---
After the addition of unidentified I haven't had any inventory space issues at all. It's a shame that's the reason we have to pay for gear templates when we just want to swap between full gear sets fast.
---
Because being a partner is not a job Anet offers you, it's more of a veterans discount. Aint no company gonna pay full time pay for youtubers or streamers. 
---
Only when you have +10k viewers per stream can you get a months worth of money in a day to play their game :^)
---
only the account shared templates will be sold in lots of 3.
---
&gt; There's no point in legendaries outside of convince.
---
TIL skins are convience
---
No... that's why I'm here, I don't see an end of my quest...
---
Sooooo... as someone who playes PvP, WvW and PvE I basically have to buy slots if I wan't to use the system? I had no problem with the monetisation and thought 3 slots per character would have been fine because I thought this was PvE only but this is like getting no Character Build Templates at all.
---
there's always a bunch of people who deliberately miss the point so they can karma whore, i've seen it happen many times on this subreddit.
---
I dunno I personally can't wait for Anet to milk people out of their money.
---
Neither of us have statistics on this, so we're both not right, but I disagree. I don't think very many players will actually take advantage of the system. Having build variety means you can do whatever you want and still be successful, not that you need to have many builds.
---
Also, anyone new that is being retained by this likely won't have a bias of thinking 6-20 builds per character is standard, and will likely be fine working within the existing system.
---
I can plug my laptop in and recharge it even when it's at full battery. It's not good for the laptop, but I can do it. Phones too.
---
Just wanted to point out that words are weird. For the record, I do 100% agree with you. It's dumb Mesmers got an upgraded version of the skill.
---
the only reason the **current** build templates were allowed was on a condition that they would be pulled as soon as the official templates were implemented. Anet could have very easily said "nope, can't do it" and y'all would have been in the dark ages until this announcement and completely hyped over it.
---
Wait, you mean, in the game? TIL that NPC has a name
---
I see - you either did not even tried to read the linked thread or your comprehension skills are lacking. Sorry for bothering, I guess.
---
I'm more amazed that they managed to come up with something worse than arc.
---
I bought the original game, both xpacs, and even spent money on gems for QoL items ONLY (no gems to gold).
---
I don't feel that ANet values me as a customer anymore, and hasn't for a long time.
---
God bless gw2 wiki, that map with extra info was so good🙏
---
Why does this seem overly convoluted?
---
Yes, the second set of gear is no longer in your inventory. Which is nice, and for me completely unexpected.
---
They even put a cap on total unlockable templates because of UI limitations. That's just limiting the selling potential (not that I agree with the sale model anyways, but thats besides the point)
---
Didn't he leave recently already ? Or am I confusing with someone else ?
---
Love the questline. Its a bit sad that it starts of with basically doing the same collection 3 times (it's a fun collection, but once would have sufficed), but after that it becomes fantastic.
---
Do you realise how ridiculous your request is? Cool your head and later read what you wrote.
---
You’ve supported trash and garbage up to this point. Good to know you finally see your mistake.
---
Never could get into PvP because I can't stand the Conquest Gamemode. Other games that use similar modes just don't click with me either.
---
Thanks, I legitimately don't know the guy. I've never seen anyone other than Dulfy and WoodenPotatoes mentioned in the ingame chat but that may be because I joined after HoT. Was he more relevant at launch?
---
I'd be willing to bet a good 90% of the playerbase doesn't even know who this guy is.
---
Im sure the Developers value you as a customer, but the corporate side of the company certainly doesn't, they don't give a single fuck if the game is actually a good product they care about squeezing your wallet until nothing is left for their shareholders.
---
What's to learn, stack up, press 1.
---
They even gave you a way to skip them...
---
Mighty Teapot or Jawgeous probably?
---
monetize it wouldn't even be that big of an issue, if it wouldn't be a massiv downgrade for a lot of people who are used to arcdps templates allowing them to fully utilize their legenderies.
---
Screams for cosmetic templates, but has no mouth
---
or just.. you know.. use your damn brain. it's what you have it for!
---
You remember shared slots? in first place we get 5slots only! You dont know how hard they work to implement this.
---
So stop be ungrateful. I saw stream about this and thinking is good and game will faster with change build a lot.
---
Templates was good true,but a net and this game is for earn money too .You not pay for gaming every month so use brain for a moment.
---
Most of the people defending this system are defending for the sake of defending. They don't seem to understand the issue at all. Look at some of the comments "devs need to eat, MMO's cost a lot to upkeep, Anet is a company, etc"
---
limited to 6 equiptment template slots is why we're angry.
---
That pride in wvw disappeared years ago from the most
---
convince*
---
Sounds Gucci my dude
---
Monetizing it wouldn't even be that big of an issue, if it wouldn't be a massiv downgrade for a lot of people who are used to arcdps templates allowing them to fully utilize their legendary gear.
---
Arc can hold unlimited builds. Official templayes are limited to 6 per character.
---
That's just considering the trait and utility swapping functionality.
---
He's prominent enough to have an NPC in the Mistlock Sanctuary named after him, but definitely not quite WP level
---
build templates is not the issue its the equipment slots you can have (only 2 per default) and you cant copy/paste those around
---
A8, bye rando asshat
---
No idea but I was referencing a quote from I think Miyani
---
Whats the movie/clip from lmao
---
ah okay, just checking. i have seen people trying to say that her firing was unjustified and "reddit got her fired" lol
---
Feel free to leave. So tired of people continuing to threaten to leave the game over some obscure change they don't like. Derior never streamed anything noteworthy anyways.
---
damn they keep stealing shit from chronos and giving it to everyone else
---
i should rephrase that, by negativity i meant criticism
---
Probably just the straw that broke the camel's back.
---
Busy work for an avarage mount , at least Dragonfall didn't have Deathwing 2.0 - oh wait it did .
---
Please, just stop talking about things you have no idea about...
---
Like all of 16 people, sure!
---
And now I'm scared to use it 😱
---
Yeah, for like 16 people.
---
Late answer, but this happens to me too and u think it might be caused if you keybind mount skills with keys used for skills.
---
I do remember shared slots. They were without a doubt, the most expensive QoL upgrades yet I still got all of them and didn't complain about it.
---
I even paid real money for the gems to help "...a net and this game [...] earn money..."
---
Shared slots and Build Templates, however, are not the same thing. They have a much different impact on the game and how the player is able to engage with it. I understand where you're coming from, but comparing templates to any other QoL (bag slots, shared slots, bank tabs, character slots) is comparing apples to oranges.
---
Dismounting someone who is running isn't terribly hard. Any ranger or high mobility dps build can do it reliably.
---
The fundamental problem with the warlaw is how quickly it unbalences fights, both in terms of time to arrival + dismount dps. Everyone getting an easy dismount attack is simply going to show how badly the warclaw creates unbalenced fights.
---
i.e. when you are in enemy territory you are likely going to die in an outnumbered chase regardless of whether you run or fight. At least before the option of running gave a decent chance of survival.
---
thats is right, arcdps will still be there...maybe i understood the comment wrong, but i though he was refering to the template function of arc.
---
Yeah, that's why they increased scourge damage and barrier application in wvw instead of reducing it like they intended.
---
Thats 3 free account-storage slots (the account-wide slots)  
---
The Gear/Build-Template Slots (the per-char slots) are most likely like bag-slots per char-purchases. Because each slot free up to 18 inventory-slots.
---
I guess I just don't think core features or quality of life should be monotized in this way? To be fair, I feel the same way about inventory slots and bank space being sold. I would kind of prefer a more clear client / customer relationship, than them introducing more features that you don't *have* to spend money on, but *it sure would be a lot more convenient if you did*. 
---
Maybe you're right, I wont be spending much money on it over all, and I can earn it with in game currency, but it just kinda feels bad.
---
Possible solution: get your devs to tag each merge ticket with the release version it's meant for. QA or they can then filter by release date and grab everything at the end and write notes. The same thing can happen, devs forget to tag the ticket correctly but tagging a ticket is quicker than writing the notes into the document on the spot.
---
You just need an easy system to be able to come back to the change you made later when actually writing release notes. You can easily tag tickets with release versions or keywords that you push and they'll always be grouped for you to work on later rather than writing the note up on the spot.
---
I prefer native templates instead of 3rd party, so no, thank you.
---
No. Man up.
---
Same reason hotdogs and hotdog buns are never sold in the same quantities.
---
Well shit. 
---
I mean, it's nice to not have to switch everything *every* time I want to change builds, but I was hoping they'd be per mode, since having two builds per mode sounds like a reasonable-ish middle ground. You'd have power and one of condi, support, or heal gear sets in PvE, and zerg and roaming sets in WvW. If someone needs an extra gear set slot, they'd usually just need one or two for the other non-power PvE sets they have or any other WvW set, like support or something else. 
---
But as it stands, we either have one PvE and one WvW slot or two PvE slots and no WvW slots, which sucks for those of us that play both modes. We should at least get three to start with, which would likely be two for your main game mode and one for the other. You'd still have people who would want one or two more, and more importantly it lets people that don't want to buy more experience both the new functionality of them (not having to switch gear manually) in their main game mode, while still encouraging playing in more than one mode (because they don't have to manually switch gear when going between them). Plus then it'd be symmetrical with the number of build slots we start with.
---
I would love just a giant cardboard box with my charr peeking out of it.
---
I figured that living people with lives who are alive  worked there, yes. What I'm wondering is why you're so worried about them financially. They didn't even indicate there was any trouble when the layoffs happened. You going off about how they're (likely) so giving but still need to make rent is like walking into a casino, telling a dealer that he's generous, and asking him if he's alright. Of course he is. They call gambling an addiction, not a hobby.
---
Devs will push changes and forget to either write a note for that change themselves or just completely and consistently forget to tell anyone else on their team that they made a certain change that probably wasn't even on their to-do list for that week. So the notes never even get written for those changes.
---
It’s taking me more than 5 min to find it via google, but they made it clear in a post on their website before PoF launched. It wasn’t in social media or an interview, I believe. But, this is commonly shared knowledge. WP has referenced it in a few of his videos.
---
Also, I appreciate the salty downvotes for sharing facts. I just don’t want OP getting their hopes up. Anet stated that new full armor sets will no longer be sold on the gem store. They would save those for in-game content and then continue to sell outfits and semi-sets or single pieces of armor on the store.
---
t for pic n good charr fashion war btw
---
If it calms you -
---
* they've been background-testing some code for around half a year to catch edgecases,

* on map change, a function runs to make sure nothing gets stuck,

It's [this thing](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Death-in-a-Bag). You could gain multiple of them if you never opened them, resulting in mine having the name "34 Death-in-a-Deaths-in-Bags". It was such a quirky name that I kept them, but after today's patch they just say "34 Bags of Death".
---
Shame, really.
---
How are they threatening exactly?
---
Where tf is the night watch stool
---
I did the same thing. I valued my time and convenience more than my gold (still do). But if you want to save every penny, I'd recommend whatever is the green rarity salvage kit for greens and lower (and then mystic for yellows, black lion for exotics).
---
This. It always feels like it's 2 steps forward, 3 steps back. This feels like a re run of "expansion worthy content" only to find out that phrase included levelling cooking to 500. It was the same with their big announcement in the theatre and now this.
---
They have a habit of exciting people then pissing them off almost directly straight after.
---
This game needs some sort of monthly sub you can opt in for various gem store items. Imagine if you pay $12-15 a month and you something like: A mount license, a outfit of your choice, 10 BL keys, etc. That is a service a lot of players would gladly sign up for each month.
---
Each character gets three personal build slots.  You can get more by unlocking extra slots on each character.  Your account can have 24 shared build slots and you'll get 6 off those free at launch.  Technically, if you forego shared builds on other characters, you can have 9 saved builds at launch.
---
It's ok most people don't really understand the time value of money or do an analysis of what they spend on. It's the same reason people won't spend $2 on a mobile game that they'll play for 20 hours but will spend $20 on takeout the same day.
---
If you're in this sub you've gotten an incredible time value for your money probably. It costs like at least $60 to go out and get dinner and a movie at any decent place for just one evening
---
On the plus side, Ascended gear now actually has some value and isn't an ignored step child. A small plus side, but one nonetheless. From here I think it's far easier for them to add value to Legen. Whether or not they actually do so is uh.. on the table I guess.
---
I think arc just demonstrated the simplicity and full capabilities of such a system that it makes anets limitations seem needless outside of a monetization standpoint.
---
I think we'd still be questioning the limitations had arc never been a thing, we'd just be blind to exactly how much anet was limiting the system's potential
---
wait, you thought they were trying to make it MORE visible?  the effect that made your entire character look like they had a pink dragonball z aura?
---
I play everything, and I have [everything](https://i.imgur.com/OXjUKel.jpg).
---
Paying for equipment tabs is really not that bad...and can be justified, as it acts as extended inventory.
---
However, paying for build tabs is stupid and cannot be justified by any means.
---
it definitely looks less like an earth element spell, more like holy magic.  but anything that's a bright glow is going to get lost in this game.  no saving it really.
---
Would you care to explain to me how spending money on a bad product makes me less of a baby?
---
And exactly how much do I have to spend to be an adult?
---
Can I pay half price and just settle for teen or young adolescent?
---
Yes, the upper limit of 6 equipment templates is "fucking fantastic" /s
---
This community is absolutely insane. That is 24 builds account-wide, that you are NOT USING. When you pull them from the library they are no longer taking up space. So your character can have 6 templates and then you can have some in a "bank".
---
This is like declaring that 17 bank tabs is "not too much in the grand scheme". Are you fucking insane? WHY on God's green earth do you need so many goddamn builds? If you need more than 6 builds per character, why not just fucking make another character and use that character's template slots?
---
The system they showed off is more than anyone was reasonably hoping for. I was 90% confident that they weren't going to even let you store your equipment in the template and that it would be like the fan-made build templates in that it would just swap gear out. And yet the first thing I see, like always, when I look at reddit is people who haven't engaged with any of this and don't know what they're talking about telling everyone who much of a failure the game is.

&gt; i expect that this costs at least full 400 gems like bag slot
---
This is also what I put them at. If they're 400 gems I deem it acceptable. Anything more and that's gonna be a issue.

I just made a Twitter for my current art! https://twitter.com/ButterUp5

Yes.  Each character gets 3 personal builds, with three more per character available for purchase.  You also get 6 shared build slots that can be expanded to 24, so you can have some builds that all characters of one type can use.

I feel like you and I are on the same page in that a lot of work went into this so it shouldn't be scrapped, but the current sale model is offputting

10 years too late, thank you Anet 🤦‍♂️

Personally I think the Skyscale questline is bad game design, pure and simple.  
---
The quest line doesn’t know what it wants to be or what it is trying to achieve.  It literally feels like it was designed to time consuming for the sake of time being time consuming.  Even then, the components of the quest line feels like it was haphazardly thrown together with minimal rationalisation.  
---
It is a far cry from the Gryphon quest line, which was largely designed to reward players that fully cleared POF content.  Even then the Gryphon quest featured a major GW1 Nightfall character and had some awesome story moments built into it.  
---
The Skyscale is a classic example of what not to do in game design.  It’s a bad idea to deliver your rewards via “Rube Goldberg game design”.  Rewards must always be a journey that feels natural to the player.  It is worth noting that the “Rube Goldberg game design” is not restricted to the Skyscale and is something that affects Season 4 as a whole.  
---
In all honesty, I would like to see more discussion on reddit on the game design of GW2.  What works, what doesn’t work, what needs improving?  If the player base make a loud enough noise on the game design issues of GW2, we might start to see better game design in GW2.

they were scattered remnants who were no real threat, and then yes, bangar got them to sign a treaty offscreen immediately before the events of bound by blood.  hardly a "handwave".

it can be blocked with guardian passive lol

Another post! Here’s my new Twitter!
---
it's fun sized, like Halloween candy
---
because they need a "technical reason" to charge money
---
Was wondering the same thing xD
---
plot twist. all this could have been avoided, if they never allowed a 3rd party dps meter.
---
So that's why I got a key, not because RNG smiled at me this time =/
