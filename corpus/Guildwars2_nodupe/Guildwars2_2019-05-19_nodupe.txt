It's more about what you want to prioritize. Some people prefer to keep their money to buy QoL stuff in the gemstore. Other just go for fashion and buy skins/legendaries. 
---

---
Personally I think that if you want to play high end PvE you should first work toward a full ascended stuff. Same if you want to play WvW seriously, ascended stuff is quite mandatory. Once you have what you need, go for the things you want.
---
---
---
I agree with basic skin legendary weapons! It was actually something they said they wanted to do before HoT but the idea was unfortunately scrapped.
---
My own guess for legendary runes and sigils is somewhere in the 2nd half of Season 5 (so some time next year?). The feature itself is probably not too far from being done as it doesn't sound very difficult for them to create but I think it will release as a whole package with the significantly more complex build templates (and *maybe* some other stuff they talked about in their future for gw2 post like cooking but the way they worded that part makes it seem like they haven't even begun to start working on level 500 cooking).
---
Except this last quarter was higher than the quarter before, therefore every quarter isnt' lower. You compare like to like in business.
---
In the months after HOT, the game did X business. In the months after POF the game did Y business.  Y business was greater than X business. In other words, even though the numbers were lower than the month PoF launched, they were higher than the months after HoT launched. That's called progression, not backsliding.
---
You can't say it's going continualliy down if it sometimes goes up.
---
The current quarter  right now, did more money than the quarter before. That's showing stability.
---
Yeah ive crafted my first ascended set 3 weeks ago and now im just wondering when to take the next big step
---
Yeah, I do agree. I'm a veteran - been playing since the 3 day head start, with a couple of months-long breaks between then &amp; now - and I really down't have much of an answer to the how do you keep veterans invested? question. There's stuff I've been doing in the game for years I still love doing now - fractals in particular - and I always look forward to the next patch, but I completely accept that isn't the case for many veterans of the game. Which can result in the whole 'there's no content!' thing.
---
What you prefer is irrelevant, it doesn't magically give story missions replay value. Even if you LOVE story, you really only can play it once, maybe a few more times if you go for achievements. That isn't sustainable regardless of whether you like the content itself or not
---
Honestly I'm assuming she was the elder dragon before him or something like how gods can be replaced. 
---
Tho not sure what of the corruption and all that. We know too little of them sadly so it's just wild guesses
---
Fanboys in this sub still in denial despite the countless times ANET have been caught doing it they will just downvote this
---
&gt; Where do you get the idea that people make business plans based on your internal logic. 
---
"Growth = Good" is my internal logic? Come on, now you're being stupid. It's not "my internal logic" that growth and more players are good for a game.
---
&gt;Name 3 MMOs that have more subscribers/players with each successive expansion.
---
[Well, warframe does](https://steamcharts.com/app/230410) does.

[Path of exile does too.](https://steamcharts.com/app/238960)
---
Dunno a third one, but these two are pretty good examples.
---
&gt;
---
Some people come back. Some people don't. That's NORMAL.
---
This is the first time I hear "Its normal for games to bleed users like stuck pigs".
---
I read that as joko willink 
---
An undead leadership specialist... I'm strangely ok with that
---
Season 2 was where they started introducing mechanics to mobs and story bosses.  There's a learning curve but you'll eventually overcome it.
---
You can but they are just un-engaging zerg content. But I'm mainly referring to living story missions and new maps (which for the most part have not had metas worth playing)
---
Ya because I totally would enjoy spiraling around a random location for 30 minutes looking for an inconspiciously placed object that is extremely difficult to find by myself and repeat that process 50 times that is surely fun
---
[Going by this chart](https://imgur.com/a/hY5ed0F#W7vehZA) Season 4 has been a downward spiral, save for 1 exception, but then the episode after the exception crashed even further below than the previous episode.
---
Not having as many people 6.5 years after launch as you do during launch is normal. Can you offer any evidence that it's not? Having a lower stable population is not bleeding like a stuck pig. Making more in the months after your second expansion than you did after your first expansion is not bleeding like a stuck pig. That is progression.
---
Only someone who has no clue about the industry things an older game will continue to get more and more players.

Tell me, does WoW have more players now than it did five years ago?
---
Iboga dps meta
---
Down with the tablets slavery! Let the nightmare free you!
---
Don’t mind me, my rp character just took over somehow.
---
A downward spiral with an exception, which is the last quarter? So it's gone up. Were there ever lower quarters after HoT? THere were. So we're higher than back then. I think you need to rethink what a downward spiral means.
---
Tell me about it, I got permanently banned last week for literally no reason whatsoever. I haven’t done any fucking shit and they said they won’t bother reviewing it. This is unbelievable.

Is the Gazelle "kick" ability while in beastmode an actual kick? Or just pure dmg

If you are brain-dead enough to feel 'immersed' to press 1 at a circle for 1 minute to fulfill your sense of immersion and wonder in a video game then this game is perfect for you because the devs cater to your exact brain-dead population that has ruined the game for everyone else
---
Unegaging to you. I'm engaged. That's the funny bit. There's plenty of stuff in this game I enjoy that raiders claim don't egage them. Raids don't engage me. See how that works?

Whether we wanted to or not, we've stepped into a war with Mordremoth in Maguuma. So let's get to taking out his lieutenants, one by one.
---
Oh no I love those. 
---
Its the... "other one"  I'm talking about.
---
Thanks you for this. So you suggest to grab all unlocks first then work my way down the document in order?
---
I realise that. I know we're not gonna kill him in the meta. But it feels like we should get the opportunity to press our advantage after weakening him, while he's stunned, before he manages to come to and shield himself.
---
The way the fight is structured, with the actual 'bosses' in the middle, makes it feel liek it should build to a greater finale.
---
Only trash developers can come up with these bugs. The worse one is when it’s trying to close a full map.
---
Only the most in demand item atm.
---
im at 76% still need to feed him 3 more rare candies... was anyone in the community able to speed run the story on release day and finish the collection up to the first time gate before reset on day one? meaning today they might have finished the skyscale care collection and should be on the next step or is everyone around the 76% completion on skyscale care?
---
No. Crafting is useless.
---
First generation is every legendary weapons that were released before HoT. Second generation is starts with HoT and ends before LS3E2. 2.5 generation is starting with LS3E2 and ended with LS4E6.
---
Oh my god, you're absolutely right - the roller beetle is SO much worse than the springer! You should make a thread about that!

There are no skins past level 30 HoM.
---
If you completed food collection the next one unlocks in 23 hours and 35 minutes from this post ^^^^^fml
---
With Season 2 they started lessening the amount of Waypoints in maps. And they also started introducing new mechanics to everything, so the difficulty ramps up a little through Season 2 and Heart of Thorns, especially that expansion. But with Path of Fire it kind of ironically cools down.
---
Thanks
---
I think you're in a good spot to start working on your first one. You mentioned having crafted your first ascended set - congrats on that! Should you choose to, fractals are a great way to get materials for legendaries, even if it's just raw gold.
---
I highly recommend using [GW2 Efficiency](https://gw2efficiency.com/) to help plan. If you're interested in a Gen 1 legendary, this will also let you know whether it's worth crafting or buying it.
---
I'm personally always working toward a legendary, even if it's rather passively, because I like having a goal in mind. You always need T6 mats and mystic clovers, but I choose to get clovers mostly through PvP/WvW so I don't have to pay for them, and I have alt accounts that help get me T6 mats quickly. Because of this, I'd say there's never a "material level" you should feel like you need to start since you have to start from somewhere! Materials will accumulate as you play. I fall in the boat of someone who doesn't buy any raw materials if I don't have to for it - so it kind of depends on how you're interested in the process, too.
---
I always craft the precursor first, and I like knocking out Gifts as I go along. (Gift of Metal, Gift of Wood, etc are particularly easy because you can plop a few characters off at node farms or run around harvesting trees).
---
First gen precursors can be bought on the TP (some of them are really cheap as well) and then crafted in the Mystic Forge without going through any of the collections. They're also not bound, so you can sell the end-result for quite a bit of profit.
---
Second gen precursors are only available through collections and are, just like the legendaries, accountbound, so you can't sell them.
---
So you didn't try and use one of the skyscales on the map, or a Springer? Or take a thermal tube and glide if it's in the fire zone? Or oakheart essence? Just because griffon is the easiest way to get it doesn't mean you need one.
---
It's written in the next collection that it unlocks after reset but ok.
---
A few people are one day ahead of that - so expect updates after reset Sunday regarding the next collection/s - but I think most are at the same position as you. If there are any who made it in before the first reset as you say they haven't posted on here this week
---
I hate time gates, but this is a good post. I would like to make a comment on the proposed solution as well as offer a thought of my own on how they could have made things better.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
For starters, the number *one* way, in my opinion, they could have prevented this fiasco? *Tell us about the time gating in advance.* They failed in community communication here. 
---
*Secondly*, the author of the post mentions making skyscales available outside the map. I think that could be done pretty easily by adding a limited number of roosts across the desert. They could have modified the lore of the skyscale minimally to accommodate this (the skyscales are spreading across the desert, but they're also aging super fast, etc.). Adding them to desert or Living World Season 5 maps would have, IMO, made sense here.
---
*Finally*, I have an idea of how they could improve this kind of mount rollout in the future. I think they would still want to follow my advice about community communication, but here's a way I believe they could improve getting a new mount like this in general: two-channel skins and branching collections. They could have mutually exclusive collections (selectable by the player) for acquiring the mount. At the end, they would receive one of a set of skins (based on the collection they chose and completed). The remaining skins of the set would be locked in the gem store, and all of these skins would be limited in dye channels so as not supplant the more premium 4 channel skins they seem to enjoy releasing there.

I'm saying a loot shooter is not an MMORPG. They're not listed in the same places. They have different sorts of thought processes behind them. I don't see them as the same. I've played Path of Exile. You compare MMORPGs to WOW as the gold standard. I don't see how an MMO shooter, or MMO strategy is the same as an MMORPG.  
---
Most people see them as different game types. The same way a moba is different from PvP in an MMORPG.
---
I think 6 months might be the absolute max if you're actively playing and farming. How are your materials looking (ectos/clovers/T6)? If you have a decent amount of materials already stocked up, I'd say it shouldn't take you more than 2-3 months. Up to 4 if you don't have many.

Hmm they dont look like sunflowers..

FML, so 48 hours to go instead of 24... guess I'll be playing the elsweyr early access while I'm forced to wait for this... can't believe someone thought time gating this was a good idea, especially over the weekend. i logged on, feed the thing than logged off. I feel salty having to wait out this time gate... Its nagging at me and is pulling enjoyment from this update...I can't even see Skyscale rentals on the map with my Alts who haven't finished the story. I would totally enjoy this collection if i could play it on my off day and binge out while I have the time instead of being forced into this waiting...  blahh

My first instinct scrolling through Reddit was that it was an origami hilt of the Master Sword from Legend of Zelda!

That said, when I saw the title, I did indeed see Kralkatorrik.

There was one throwaway line during season 3 from some gossiping asura that her time in Mordremoth's pod shenanigans had turned her into a drooling mess and her recovery was taking a very, very, very long time. Zojja's VA wishes to reprise the role, and ANet have said they will work with her again when she is needed in the story. That was quite a while though, things may have changed, who knows.
---
Her voice actress moved on to other things, so they had to write her out.  Although I remember hearing recently that she’s willing to come back.
---
I don't have the time or energy to do research for you, but a simple search found this thread from six months ago, so it's something to look at. The comments under will explain more. The point is, a 6.5 year old game isn't expected to make more money year on year...it's expected to find a stable user base.  That's just how it works.
---

---
It's both. Damage and CC.
---
Fairly well? Sounds like someone should try it with Guiles theme then
---
It's like the Mordremoth meta. The map meta is just a distraction as damaging his body does nothing.
---
If you assume they have them, you can't be disappointed if they do, just pleasantly surprised if they don't.
---
Yeah I hate this. I like to switch characters for open world stuff because it gets a bit boring using the same character all the time. But I don't want to do the story 4 more times for the characters I use. Even if you only have to do it up to the skyscale step, its still tedious.
---
Created this character right after the beta. I think a little before actual full release.
---
A comedy of errors I am sure
---
I am still waiting for her to jump out of a corner with her giant Mk. MCCCXXXVII Golem to safe an otherwise lost day.

ehhhh, I don't understand your question. are you asking if there are more epic events in the game?

There's totally not major issues with everybanwave that have to get fixed by reddit. No appeals!
---
I'm obviously talking about the interaction between Gorrik and the Commander after finishing the last feeding session as in I predicted how it will go down. No need to be rude smh
---
&gt; so the rules don't apply to them?

No, the rules applies to players, not people making the game.

By the same logic you'd expect devs to get banned for hacking when coding anything in the game.

you guys remember during living story 2 after that one episode came out where we had the vision from the pale tree and we are like swimming through the air? Remember all of the different tonics people used for the hilarious screenshots? I'm seeing this happening again.
---
I'm still disappointed about how they wasted Gandara
---
I think some people have it far worse and they're the ones I feel sorry for - if you don't have the Charged Quartz or Grow Lamp recipe that's a stupid amount of unrelated time or gold you have to drop. 
---
I think some time-gating is acceptable. My main issue with the patch is how disjointed the Skyscale seems from it. The mount should have been involved in the story, lore collections in the map etc. You should be able to gain experience when using borrowed mounts in the map (if you're implementing a time-gated collection). Instead its ham-fisted in at the end, you repeat collections across the same areas, collect 12(?) eggs yet hatch one, then  leave the map to do random magic collections.
---
I imagine it's the same as previous maps, it should work with multiple alts.
---
I was legitimately surprised they didn't use Fear Not This Night - particularly the instrumental version used for the personal story stage - when we fight the phantom Eye of Zhaitan in the last mission.
---
Great example, thanks!  Just tested it in-game to compare and it looks like the same filter but zoomed out?  Weird bug.

I'm gonna gear up now. I have a build that I am satisfied with, but maybe I should experiment more. And I try to accommodate the way I play according to the enemy, but during the battle it doesn't always work that way. Thank you yet again!

For the german voices they changed VA's of several characters over the time. Zojja got a new one somewhere in LS2, several NPCs have the voices of Faolain, Canach or Eir. And... since LS4 Braham has the same VA as Trahearne... ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
good question, and personally i enjoy the uncertainty for now. i will however say that i had more than enough of the human-centric nostalgia fan service.
---
Give the devs a break man. I'm here hoping to make legendaries tradeable again but there's no need to rush a third set. You're right there's no reason to stop per say, but they finally followed through and finished the second set. Better late than never. To promise another set and not finish it is going to leave a bad taste. Let them take a break with the weapons. Sigils and runes are next.
---
Oh my god you can't just ask someone why they're alive

It amazes me how much a sky can set the atmosphere, GW1 looks like a regular desert but in GW2 it feels dirty and sandstorm-y.
---
Guild Wars 1 had GvG battles
---
It amuses me that this is getting downvoted, but it doesn't surprise me. The community as a whole likes to forget about these quickly after the initial outrage because it hurts the game as a whole. In that regard, they aren't wrong, but it also means that ArenaNet doesn't change anything. Would the April 2018 banwave have happened if ANet was held more accountable for their actions?

---
They did say that season five was coming and have since spoken a little bit more about the process of how they'll do it, so that gives at least some confidence.
---
At the same time, there is very much that sense of finality that you talk about. To put it one way: IF this was the last bit of storytelling in GW2, it would be a very fitting ending.
---
My take on it is that they do plan to release more content and tell more of the story, but they designed War Eternal in such a way that if something did not go as planned or if there was an unexpected shutdown, the story would have a fitting conclusion. I think they intend to keep going but finished season 4 in a way that it WOULD work as a cap on the entire story if season 5 never comes for some reason. 
---
I suspect that season five will go in a very different direction storywise for similar reasons. Let's say they get 3 episodes into season five and then the word comes down that that's it, the game is going into maintenance mode or even shutting down. If the story of season five is about... internal Charr politics, or trying to save the Kodan from global warming, or doing some random thing in Cantha, as much as it would be disappointing not to finish that story, *the main story of the game from launch* would be at least be finished. The Elder Dragons arc could be considered done with. They will have told the main story of GW2 anyways. One can even imagine a situation where they find three episodes in that the end has come but they get to make on final episode to wrap things up. If we were still in the midst of worrying about a bunch of Elder Dragons there would be no way to give a satisfying conclusion in one episode, but if it's some new story maybe they could pull that off and end with everything tied up. Giving a note of finality to the Elder Dragon stuff now just ensures that that story gets a satisfying conclusion no matter what happens down the line, even if they still expect the game to keep going for years to come.
---
Thank you. As tempting as it is to go through with this, it takes ages because I can't get anything to look right, and it's especially slow since my phone has a really small screen that's hard to draw on. Maybe someday I'll ascend to some level of skill, but probably not today. Your kind words are appreciated &lt;3
---
you realise you're only proving his point, right?
---
I am 90% sure this is bait but I will answer anyway. You feed it only 4 times and there are two remaining collections, one will be unlocked on the upcoming reset.
---
The Game Director said Season 5 is coming in an official post. On the Guild Chat for Requiem a week ago, at least three of the writers confirmed they're currently working on Season 5. Just because we didn't get a trailer doesn't mean they're lying to us.

Yo shout out to you being really cool you were in my map on release day. Was an honor to fight along the legendary Pawala Joko
---
&gt; The longer the game has existed, the more people that will reach a place where they have all the gear they really want or need.
---
I mostly get around this by having 22 characters and not settling for one set of each weight ascended/legendary to juggle between them.
---
No idea what their budget for VO actors is or what goes on behind the scenes, but they have two pretty big VO names in the credits with Felicia Day and John DiMaggio. And as much as a love our nerd goddess, if the choice had to be made to shell out big bucks for her or shell out big bucks for the guy who played Bender and Jake the Dog, the choice seems obvious.
---
TBH, I'd rather see Day doing more MST3K. Because I want to see more MST3K.
---
I'd like the medium chest if it wasn't for the titties they put on it for males. ;/
---
Wait...so Palawa Joko actually killed Zhaitan and Mordremoth? The stuff they teach in the academy is true?!
---
One thing I am really happy with is that we for once get to come to a close without the next villain already standing by just waiting for his cue.
---
I wonder if Aurene can actually absorb magic from other sources. Kralk comments on the fact that they are in harmony within her, but this could have to do with her particular circumstances. She absorbed Zhaitan's and Mordremoth's magic before she was born, and Balthazar showed up for the moment of her birth, while her innate element is the same as Grandpa Kralk's. No guarantee that she can absorb Primordus without going crazy.
---
Personally I think that Aurene is going to take some time off to do Elder Dragon stuff and we are going to do some lower intensity stuff in the meantime. The only way to seriously keep her in the story would be if a villain shows up that is even more powerful than Kralkatorrik ever was and at this point it would be getting ridicilous.  
---
I really hope that we can do a bit of a rebuilding arc. The story only ever really glances over the fact that the world keeps going, that new airships are being constructed all the time and that the Pact is still recruiting. I would like to see a chance to set some things right in the world. We could try cleaning up the brand, instating a functional government in Elona, see if the Olmakhan want to go home or stay part of the greater world, push out and reclaim lands from Jormag while he is asleep and so on.
---
Serpent's Ire is not popular due to bad rewards compared to other meta events and it is difficult to complete unless organised by somebody. It requires a lot of CC in one of the phases or everybody dies and the event fails. You can guess what happens in most unorganised maps.
---
If you do want to do Serpent's Ire and you're in the EU region then [Mornjack](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bbyjue/can_we_talk_about_vabbis_meta_morpokks_back_eu/) runs it twice a week. [TTS Gamers](https://ttsgamers.com/event-calendar/) in NA did run it as well but I'm unsure if they still do.

In which case you managed to do it without the griffon, good job.
---
I could have, but the brain just didn't go there sadly.
---
Kralk's Torment appears to have been caused by the presence of multiple magic "schools", which hasn't really happened in history to our knowledge. Even the commander stated that EDs weren't "meant" to contain so much magic, that's why there have always been six elder dragons to keep the magic separate. So that kind of  madness isn't connected to whatever was happening in the distant past.
---
I assume they just want to leave Destiny's Edge behind story wise.

I can't help but think that if the old crew were still there, they'd have looked at this whole crazy time gate stuff and would have put the kibosh on it pretty quick.  Because they are experienced, they'd know this is a bad idea.  So, they fired those people, and this whole thing has me wondering who's running things now.. Like, some middle manager somewhere comes up with an idea, "Hey, I know!  Let's lock EVERYTHING behind 2 weeks' worth of time gates!  That'll be FUN!  People will LOVE it!"  And because all the experienced people have been let go, everyone in the room just nods, and says that's a good idea..   
---
I mean, I hope that's not the case, but there's this niggling feeling in the back of my mind that's making me wonder, as I stare at my computer waiting for tomorrow's next time gate, and not even knowing how much longer it will be.
---
This is the left overs of everyone who got fired while they were working on mobile titles and shit, and probably why the patch got extended just so they could implement this dumb method with what they know best lol.  
---
Find it funny how PvP Balance and this shit is what we see after the layoffs.
---
Haha brilliant
---
It's time gated but it's not much of a time sink. The gold requirement is only expensive because of the glow lamp which was flipped by TP barons.   
---
So far, you're not exactly right but I understand it feels that way.
---
Does the Orchestral weapon skins have special effect? Music?
---
Wait til they find out about quality armor...

Weren't all GW1 games pretty "finale" in feel? EotN was the only was that was truly an expansion and set up for GW2, but the rest were all standalone games really. Anyway, GW1 didn't always have an upcoming world catastrophes knocking at the door so to speak and it did just fine, so I'm sure GW2 can manage... Personally, I find it a bit weird how the community here seems so dependent on a teaser of what is next and can't seem to appreciate a resolution to a plot that started almost 5 years ago in S2. That said, I think they were so adamant about S5 continuing the story because they knew there would be some concern since the ending of S4 could have very well have been the ending of the game. But even if that may have been the plan at some point and the plans changed, we know we're getting more so I don't see why we need an explicit reassurance in-game to show us that.
---
As for "we have no major open story lines", that is debatable... And there certainly were some hints of potential plot points (e.g. "mother", Taimi's Illness, and even Caithe returning to the Grove). There also are some other unresolved plot points, though most wouldn't be considered major. Still, there is one active Elder Dragon that we know nothing about and two sleeping ones that can reawaken at any time for all we know. We may have a friendly Elder Dragon, but we have no idea how this will all work and there is a good chance Elder Dragon vs Elder Dragon would end poorly for the planet similar to what Kormir said about God vs God. Also, with how messed up the magic is, Aurene may have her work cut out for her trying to rebalance the planet's magic. But even if we don't go after another dragon directly, there is still the whole Jormag's Tooth situation and Braham did just kinda vanish on the Norn so they'll probably be expecting him to go kill Jormag when we get back; even more so if we have a good dragon to help. Also, all the hints at Lyssa are left unanswered...
---
Also, another question is do we need a major story? I mean there should be some big threat, but I don't think they need to be as big as Elder Dragons to be interesting or good. For example, as scatterbrained as S3 was, the White Mantle parts of it were pretty interesting; E3 didn't even involve Mursaat and it was still pretty great. So if we did go back to smaller yet still threatening scale stories like racial stuff, it would justify why we don't whip out the Elder Dragon since it is too petty of affairs to concern her while still giving us a new challenge. As for what we could do, the Flame Legion is still about. And we have no idea what state the Nightmare Court is in post HoT, but it could very well make a comeback. The White Mantle is probably done until they resurface again a few centuries later. The Inquest are surely about, but after Rata Primus they are probably not in the best shape. Also, we never resolved the whole Aetherblade fleeing to the mists thing in S1... And I fully expect we'll get a very angry mail or conversation with Zojja for killing Kralk without her (honestly lot to explore there since we still haven't seen her deal with Eir's death and it would be remiss for S5 not to involve her somehow).
---
Daily tasks. we have that everywhere in the game. Fractals, daily pvp, daily tasks etc, to reach a long term reward. I don't see the issue
---
Season 5 should be a brand new villain poking Steve. Steve gets annoyed and that’ll be the next expansion.
---
By the gods, a female charr... I thought those were just a myth.
---
Yea!! I took a screenshot of mine just now

They're extremely pretty birds
---
Just like mama bird used to make.
---
Okay this is ridiculous. I know people think this story stuff is written as they go along, but it's really not. The dragon at the end of Mystic Cave chapter was the one from the Sylvari tutorial. It started even back then. The egg that was Aurene started out in the beginning of Season 2, long before HOT.  Anet doesn't just make stuff up as it goes along. They have long term story arcs. Writers in the past have as much said this. 
---
That's not to say they can't think of something really cool and introduce it, but I guarantee you they're not just winging this. And btw, most of the stuff isn't teased until a week before it's ready to come out.
---
Waaaaaaay back when, there were these consumable consortium items that would create crafting stations.  Haven't seen them in ages though.
---
quality content take my upvote
---
Wow, TIL. canach doesn't sound like bender or Jake. I didn't event know bender and Jake were voiced by the sane guy! He's good
---
From what I heard the VO wanted a bigger salary but anet said no so they wrote her out of the story very suddenly.
---
You seem pretty low IQ yourself, as with most people in GW2Reddit, as observed by the constant whining by the general populous about the skyscale time-gate.
---
Generally speaking, people of the same state stick together...because they feel a sense of belonging; so, don't feel bad if you ever realize your futility.
---
Stay ignorant, stay blissful.
---
Most people playing gw2 don't have a 2080ti. It's not magic. Its money lmao.
---
The game is not GPU limited in those scenarios - or in almost any scenario, really. The FCAT data, should you actually try to collect it, will show that clearly.
---
Why movement speed runes? With mounts(or F3 auto for swiftness in dungeons/fractals) that seems like a waste, unless that movement speed is critical in raids? I'm not a raiders so idk
---
Title concept: "The Grind"
---
I see you have not heard that there is a second timegate inside the third collection. A minimum of 4 days is required for this part alone. If you didn't have the materials beforehand and are not willing to buy them from the tp then it would take you a minimum of 22 days.
---
Must be the new intern. Should probably stick to just doing coffee runs.
---
Monday would be the earliest, unless there are more hidden time-gates.
---
On the off chance you're being serious, this is a meme based on a character named Lord Faren from the human story, who stays with us through quite a bit of the later stories. He's the one who keeps saying it. It's just an NPC mate.
---
Yup, they each have a couple of unique sound effects. See [here](https://youtu.be/Y6jDbRmS4RU).
---
With minimal settings it can run \~60, because there will be nothing on screen :D
---
But still some areas, like Urban Battleground fractal start, will still lag out to below 60.
---
CHOYA STAMPEDE!
---
I believe we will know tomorrow after reset since people who were quick enough to finish the first collection before daily reset on tuesday would have done the last feeding today after the reset so gotta wait for the next day to get the next collection :)
---
that_shaman has pulled strings and posted them on twitter showing you'll have jumping puzzles to do and part 5 has you going over in LS4 maps. no clue whether there are more timegates there tho.
---
Anywhere. And I’m very excited about it.
---
The nostalgia!  
---
Every time a new map is released, I tend to go look for familiar GW1 places and landmarks. The feeling of finding and recognizing something is really great, but I gotta say your screenshots are absolutely amazing and they way you match the sceneries doubles the effect! &lt;3
---
Thanks to the devs for paying so much attention even to the smallest details!  
---
Also thanks [/u/that\_shaman](https://www.reddit.com/u/that_shaman) for your [Historical guide to Tyria](https://www.thatshaman.com/tools/guide/?v=4&amp;x=-776.06&amp;y=955.125&amp;z=3), which greatly helps in finding the landmarks every time!
---
Wow! Thank you so much! I really appreciate you taking the time to look and say something!
---
do you have any links for that? because all I ever heard was that due to motherhood she didn't have time for a while but is willing to come back. 
---
if there was a dispute over salary, ANet would just replace her, but since they still haven't done so, I find it unlikely, and more reasonable that they will get her again when zojja is important to the story. getting day for just a few lines in an episode is probably too much of a hassle due to scheduling though.
---
Only to +7 (wiki or checking the fractals npcs is your friend) 
---
You can sell them on tp and buy the +1's
---
&gt;A: Yes. So far you dno't need Chapter 2 ("A Bug in the System" located in Sandswept Isles)

You will need it very soon.

Not that I know of. Plus if there is one it would cost you more money to do than its worth. Upgrade them all to the same tier or sell the excess on the TP. Another option is to just keep them in your bank so you can grow a stack of them over time while you wait to do something with them.... this is my preferred method.
---
no they wont change anything, most ppl will have the mount before the 24th when the talk about in guild chat
---
I heard enough people dont mind it,but Well u only see the vocal minority. 
---
Griffon-to expensive 
---
Beetle-to fast
---
Skyscale-to long
---
And then back to crying there is no content
---
This won't end well.
---
I'll... Okay I admit, I thought that Mordremoth was a magical green Charr at first. Good stuff though! Keep it up!
---
Once again, artificially stretching "content" out is not actual content. Stop using this flimsy excuse.
---
Man I am so tired of this "people rush and complain about lack of content" crap. I like to do things at my own pace. I NEVER complain about lack of content unless the game is just BAD, and GW2 is fun at its core, so.. yeah.
---
It's seriously strawman-y and BS and I'm tired of it. I wanna earn it at my own pace then do whatever the heck I wanna do. Which is a bit of everything.
---
Yeah it's not like everyone doing this crap in map chats (In NA at least) are memeing and talking about how lame an idea it is... oh wait they are.
---
&gt;You got something against *Steve*?
---
FTFY.
---
im rich you know
---
&gt;"there is nothing to do"
---
which actually there isnt much to do in the new map it's always the same, new release that will be dead in 1-2 weeks and timegating doesnt solve anything, it's just prolonging the inevitable   
---
and do one said they want the mount right away with 0 effort, but just forcing us to wait for daily resets to start the next step in the collection or making you feed the dragon 3 times a day for no reason
---
Better than moot loot
---
I like it
---
I don't know if you're trolling or not but if a game makes you say this, it's time for you to take a break. Even joking about this isn't funny.
---
r/trahearneJokes
---
I recently had to go back to Ember Bay to farm an Ascended trinket, since I had more Petrified Wood than any other Ascended trinket currency.  I was surprised to see it's still an active map, with all the meta's being done regularly, even the event to escort the Skrit treasure hunting on the east coast fills up if you advertise in map chat. 
---
And yes the lighting is really fitting for the location.
---
I guess I'll just wait till they fix it to do it or ill just skip it entirely...
---
Yes, but Almorra's not the one calling the shots for Pact bureaucracy per se due to her Vigil commitment as general and in S3 she was simply the herald for the powers that be to deliver messages to the Commander, Rytlock and Logan with offers or demands (in case of Rytlock, and it's interesting that she even bothered to deliver messages on the High Legions' behalf). She only acted as a stand-in until Logan accepted the offer of becoming marshal.
---
Sadly we don't know if Almorra and Logan had any off-screen discussions about Logan's decision to join the fight on the front lines against the backers' wishes, but Almorra has always done things her own way (like allowing her grandcub Ember to spy on her for Ash Imperator Malice because she trusted Ember and respected Malice who respected her back so everyone involved was aware of what each of the women was doing and why) and would likely not let Pact bureaucracy or corporate decisions to factor into her chance to finally gut Kralkatorrik.
---
OP, welcome to tyria. I hope you have tons of fun in your journey. I have an advice, "don't rush", try to enjoy and absorb the world as you go. I hope this will be a great experience for you. My best regards.
---
P.S
---
Your drawing looks pretty good! XD I was wondering if you could do one for me, because I have no skill. XD
---
I like it. There are usually the same 3 people complaining in /m for an hour, rather than a full map complaining. I saw players asking how to mute /m because they hated the constant complaining by the few who dislike it. And the map did the meta, so there wasn't few people around.
---
Took us over 5 years id like to say, to see Aurene in an egg to being fully grown. I find it healthy to watch a creature in game, grow to be a mount that you get to control and in what.. a few days? Lol like grow up the game has been out for 7 years. What's a few days going to damage now?
---
I 100% agree. It’s seems like the world map version was the thing they put the least resources into considering how high quality the actual story was. I hope the fix it in a future batch.
---
What's the best way to do the t4 Verdant Brink meta? I really want the bladed chestpiece and have been checking lfg constantly all week with no luck. It seems like there are groups that want to kill the bosses, but none that want to do the whole meta event.
---
This argument comes up even in more traditional MMOs too. The hardcore crowd goes "no content" where really they mean "content I don't enjoy because I'm jaded and if it's not helping me progress into some higher social standing by having completed more content than others then I don't care about it."
---
It’s not the fact that it takes a few days by itself, it’s the fact that the 4 days adds nothing to the game other than unnecessary time hating for no good reason at all. Aurene was meant to grow up over the course of 5 years because she was a STORY character we were meant to build a connection with, not a GAMEPLAY mechanic that shouldn’t be built up the same as a character. Honestly I’m not feeling a “connection” to my skyscale by running around gyros with its egg and feeding it for 4 days straight. Honestly how does this excuse exist?
---
&gt; loool why you're keep denying about it 
---
Feel free to show me where I claimed to be rank 1, if you can't just shut up. I seriously hope you are at max 15 years old, otherwise your way of argueing is goddamn embarassing.
---
&gt; go ahead share api key of yours? you been claiming you're richer than 99% of gw2 accounts. let's go :D 
---
Why excactly would I share my API key with a mentally unstable,  narcissistic autist? You've already proven you can't handle being inferior in such trivial things as AP (wtf man, that's just a number), ingame currency in a game (seriously?), or having a certain amount of ingame items (e.g. legendaries). 
---
We started out on "you have 500-5k AP max and are not a veteran" (how is this even supposed to be an insult to me) and slowly evolved your delusion once you realised my alt account has more AP than your main. We went from you wanting proof to me having "hmtl edit skills". I didn't see you posting your API code btw, you just showed me a screen of 2 accounts and told me you have 3 more who are similiar lol. 6 months later I don't know if you're seriously still that stupid to think I told you I am rank 1, or if you actually realised I never said that and you're just keep going about it and me not proving it to cope your inferiority. Anyways, me showing you my API key won't change a shit. You've already proven several times to bend reality towards you not being a miserable little child, so even if I did show you, you'd just come up with the next excuse (how about my API hack skills?)
---
Someday I'll establish my prominence
---
You're making me sad!
---
I miss my bun buns, and honestly it was just buffed too.
---
Or,
---
Less violence, more violets I say
---
I like some of it. I don't like some of it. But the reaction is way overblow. I'm 57 years old, I guess my generation is used to working for stuff over time and not having everything right away. It's just not a big deal. What's the difference if I don't have a mount that I didn't have yesterday for a month or a week or a day?
---
I dont mind it at all. But I can play a bit every day and am used to grinding dailies for months. I can devote a bit of my playtime to the collection stuff and then go back to Fractals or what else I want to do. I dont mind taking things slowly, maybe others should learn that too?
---
The only thing that doesnt make any sense is a timegate that uses a material that is timegated itself. It would be fine if the time would align, but it doesnt, rendering the feeding timegate irrelevant if you dont already have the Charged Quartz.
---
Can anyone tell me how regularly arena net will do a sale of path  of fire and / or heart of thrones , not sure yet weather i want to get into the game
---
I have a great feeling that the next season will be a buildup for expansion 3
---
I had that happen to me today, and I also had the final pre-event bug on a different map. It's... been fun.
---
You need to spell out 1327 in words, like "thirteen twenty seven", or else people will start recognizing your gag by noticing the 1327 numerals at the end of your post. It's easier to recognize four numbers very quickly, than it is to recognize words out of the corner of your eye before you've actually read them. It's the same reason shittymorph spells out "nineteen ninety eight" in words.
---
Everyone COME!
---
Good meme
---
I wish there was more room to fly away from the island. Obviously there's no point than ever being more than five feet from the island since there's nothing out there, but it'd be nice to not get ported when trying to griffon my way around the map. Just needs a little breathing room.
---
BY STENDARRS HAMMER! WHAT SAVINGS!
---
Honestly, the best way is probably to not. It requires a lot of time and coordination that most people don't want to put in. If you want the coat box, join in on any boss kills you see: coat boxes have a chance to drop from the boss chests. Otherwise, for a guaranteed (but slow) method, run HoT reward tracks in PvP or WvW, you can get bladed coats from them (I think you have to run through the chain of Verdant Brink -&gt; Auric Basin -&gt; Tangled Depths tracks to unlock the Heart of Maguuma track with that option though).
---
If you want to go the t4 route, you'll probably have to find a guild group that runs it. I don't know any off the top of my head though.
---
Regular player of 3 years. Made Exordium, my fifth lege, and feel pleased with crafting at the moment, even though this has been my main motivation/joy of playing. Now I'm a bit stuck at what to do in game, as I'm a bit of a farming-person. Any tips of fun things to do?
---
I like the idea of putting errant debris around the edges to make it look more like islands from the mists fell onto tyria. Looks almost like 3-4 rocks conveniently landed in a square.
---
You seen the size of those? The little shit ate an entire dolyak by the end of it 
---
Imersion totally ruined
---
Agreed, my only guess as to why that is the way it is would be because of engine restraints, as the map has a whole bunch of moving parts and intricacies in it, so adding more space would stress it even more. Then again, the core PoF maps are bigger, but not as complex in some cases, so who knows whats under the hood :P
---

Wow. Thank you so much!

What if it is your real name? Joko is a common name in Indonesia so it might happen that someone named Joko Palawa IRL.
---
I chuckled so hard that my beer went up my nostrils xD
---
So tired...
---
I myself am quite enjoying the collection and I think it has a good pace to it. The feeding time gates is no problem as I have plenty of things to do in the game while I wait on reset. 
---
I find it amusing reading these whiny, impatient posts so I hope they don't change the collection.
---
Thanks for the warning. I did not know about that.
---
and today is the last day of those 4 days, for anyone who managed the first part on day 1. OP is asking if, after the last feeding, there are more timegates or if the rest is open.
---
No Endgame meme comments? O.o
---
Over the course of Living World Season 4, 4 new masteries were released.
---
One of them, "Bond of Faith", unlocks a skill with the same name that is available when you're riding a mount. You can press it to dismount yourself and gain a vertical boost. The reason why this skill has a blue wings effect is that the masteries are themed after a spiritual bond with Aurene.
---
Tbh for a veteran with max masteries, maxed mounts and lot of HoT experience the new map is easy to navigate, especially after the labyrinth that was TD.
---
But for new players that are still progressing through their mastery tracks, it truly can be challenging.
---
That was Always different between Maps. Diflurite was Always 1 full map per Account per day,
---
"Have you been to the cloud district lately?  Oh what am I talking about, of course you haven't."  Wait...what game are we talking about again?
---
Yea. It would already help if the water extended a bit outwards in some areas.
---
&gt; Is there any word on Anet foxing the skyscale time-gated bullshit that makes me suicidal?
---
Yes, they said all the mouth-breathers that complain that they have to log in to play their game can go kill themselves.
---
I appreciate the effort but in the end the cutscene was just a bit of camera movement with a low resolution and framerate sprite placed in the center. Which didn‘t look very good.
---
But as I said, doesn‘t mean that I didn‘t enjoy it. The cutscene is pretty great in it‘s own way.
---
and then you are foregetting your skyscale. Like some 3rd wheel on a date with our mounts. "B-But...No one loves skyscale..." as a tear of vostile magic leaves his eye. See you made him cry.
---
I don't know about everyone else but Springer is my unsung hero of Dragonfall. Riding my bunny all the time around the cliffs to get over tall cliffs. So much faster than Skyscale and she combos with Bond of Faith's leap well too!
---
They come up for sale at about 30% off fairly frequently and 50% isn't unheard of. We don't know much in advance, but they're frequent enough.

It's so stupid that, after Thunderhead Peaks, this new map is so cleanly rectangular...

The tail being clipped at the north side makes it all the more obvious. You can't fly around it.

This is the ambient dialogue you get from the melandru Lane. There is some more dialogue when you get at the end of the meta. But first I want to show the other lanes' dialogue :)

---
&gt; Literally no one I’ve heard in game or on reddit/twitter etc. actually likes it, so speak for yourself.
---
you just invalidated your own argument in the same sentence.
---
Thank you as always for this awesome tool. Please provide some clarification - In this post, you state that you recommend extracting the archive into the GW2 folder. However, on your quick start guide, you recommend that it is not placed there.
---
Because it works in combat.
---
So how did for example Primordus absorb zhaitans power?
---
I don't like how if you travel 2cm out to sea it says "You have met a strong current and will be pushed back". Like I just want to be able to glide around the edge on my griffon and it's really difficult sometimes to get to an open space when it's locked by a barrier. At least make the barrier further away from the edge of the map.
---
I find this especially strange because the previous three releases all nailed it with the borders. But now this one really hurts to look at. Like, really really. 
---
I don't believe they will fix a cosmetic issue like this though. :/
---
IIRC it's on sale in the gem store right now, like 700 gems.
---
As far as I know, power renegate is pretty limited to being a [Diviner's geared alacrity bot](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Renegade_-_Boon_Support_Power_DPS_\(Fractal\)) they do pretty well in Fractals paired with a firebrand. But the current issue with power rev now ends up being the fact that if you're intending on crafting diviner's gear, eh.... Have fun in Thunderhead Peaks.
---
Absolutely. A bit more empty ocean around would have been very nice.
---
You play as a Alacrity Renegade in Diviner's gear.
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Renegade_-_Boon_Support_Power_DPS_(Fractal)
---
Ohhhh this one triggered me.
---
Did they reactivate BL Keys for Map completion? I'm lvling an engi but havnt gotten anything in 10+ maps.
---
You can have diviners asc trinkets in S3E3, fractals, pvp, wvw, and dragonfall, and maybe some other ways îve forgot to mention. Not so restrictive beside diviners insignia and inscription.
---
I am always amazed by how little such threads find their way up here. ESO isn't nearly as pretty but the Summerset expansion had a number of "Wow, this game is sooo stunning!!" threads every week. Here in GW2, its like people just got used to it already.
---
I agree though, Dragonfall looks amazing. And your screens are well done, too.
---
The flesh worms kept photobombing.
---
Logging into click a button 3 times a day vs clicking it 12 times in 1 day is same amount the chapter "offers".
---
Timegates like this don't change what is offered or how much you play to do it. It only forces you to have an artifical block which may not be bad for you, it can ruin the experience for others.
---
So.. "Don't know why people think there is something more to do when something is just timegated."
---
Dragons are boring at this point, I would rather them do anything else for a while and return to dragons later if they must.
---
We still have other things to do, like for Asura maybe cleaning up the destroyers in deep Tyria now that Primordus is back sleeping or Norn making a return to Far Shiverpeaks now that Jormag is sleeping, finding the Malyck's tree and other sylvari and visiting the whole Blood Legion Homelands. There is also Cantha to return, but Humans are as overused as Dragons at the moment so maybe not.
---
More violets, I say. Less violence.
---
I was expecting more like, 10. Really confused me for a moment. :P
---
so power rev as a dps sucks eh? disppointing. Thanks.
---
Cut out the B part at the end when the rewards stack up at 3 bags of gear and the bulls are running.
---
Mount, dismount tag, and repeat.
---
i have a tshirt printed that on my back
---
These are generally so useful. I love just throwing them at annoying mobs to keep them on the ground while I am busy doing other things.

The Pact should ship these to other zones for future campaigns. It's not like they'll go out or something.
---
Found the "guys wait for me" person.

I love it when you talk to them at the camp and there is this heated exchange where Rytlock keeps interrupting Logan.

It does, i have like 5k +1's, tell me they dont take bank space :P

\*Tips Fedora\*
---
It's definitely a thing, and it is very frustrating. Found it hard to run the meta yesterday.
---
Here’s a tip that not enough people have figured out. It’s incredibly easy to get keys for doing the big events on the map, especially with the roller beetle circuit that runs around the whole map.
---
At the start of a new map (after reset) go run around and put 1-2 pieces in to the bridge event. Don’t stick around to finish, just put a couple of pieces in and move on. You can get 2-3, sometimes even all 4 bridges, which means 4 keys. 
---
Now you have the three camps. Tagging the initial escorts gets you 3 free keys at the end of each escort, and there’s 3 chests that spawn then as well. Boom, 9 free chests at the start of the map.
---
Each zone also has an event where you hunt down a branded mender. This also spawns 3 chests with 3 free keys each. Boom, 9 more free chests.
---
All three zones have collection events that need to be done in order to progress the map. Simply pick up 5 embers/chains/tears and deposit them and you can get the keys for those events. There are also dolyak supply escorts you can tag for keys after these events end.
---
Also all three events have an early event where you nuetralize the brand storms. Tag them all, get 3 keys,
---
If you want a spot where a bunch of events intersect, the brand storm zone just north of the olmachan camp frequently has events occur on top of each other. I’ve had 4 events on top of each other at one time, and the Ember Gate bridge isn’t far from there either, so you can easily see when that event comes up.
---
Also every one of the engineer events just before the meta is a different event, meaning that’s 9 events for 9 keys. 
---
Basically, once you learn what events occur and roughly when they are you can fly all over the map tagging stuff like in the Silverwastes. In my last run I had 30 keys when I finished the meta.
---
Thank you! :)
---
I personally don't care at all how the map looks like but i agree the new map is just so good. Best living story map to this day since silverwastes.
---
WTF lmao
---
I didn't read this post n just went straight into the comments cuz I genuinely wanted to know if this game was worth playing in 2019 but then ppl kept rofl'ing n saying "best shitpost" 
---
So I finally read it and getting "both expansions plus 50 other games for $2"?! 😂
---
Sweet, sweet loot!
---
Man, reading through this I could hear every voice line perfectly in my head. I haven’t played the game in months lol.
---
It's still *fine* as DPS but does much better as a supporting role that  brings some damage to the group, yeah.
---
U do not too had pickup them, there is a enternal Ember storage by the shrine of Balthsar
---
Blame the fact that the game runs on an outdated engine and that it won't take advantage of new hardware.
---
You can have the highest spec rig available and you'll still most likely run into problems.
---
This was a bit incoherent to read and I’m tempted to ask “Why The Bolds” but I do want to address a few points.
---
* Aurene actually firsts speaks in Ep. 5. You can hear her and Caithe layer their voices and the devs confirmed that it was indeed in there. 
---
* Aurene explains pretty clearly why she stayed dead. The brand pierced her heart and she was stuck like that until she was able to heal it with Joko’s magic. And that’s true, you can see where the brand pierced her. When we fight Joko in episode 3 and take him out he’s “dead” for about 10 seconds before pulling himself back together. That’s his magic, and now it’s Aurene’s. Being a Lich has always meant that you just come back to life when you die and don’t have to worry about its permanency. 
---
* The team has been setting up Rox’s story with the Olmakhan since episode 2 of this season, though I am surprised they kept so much of it tied to map events and not the story instances. 
---
* What exactly is so weird about flying into a giant dragon and stabbing its heart with a spear designed to kill it?
---
* Taimi sounded... normal. I mean, her voice actress is Jimmy Neutron. She’s going to sound like a kid at times XD
---
I assume so, too. It would be the wisest approach in boosting revenue and pleasing NCSoft for another few years.
---
It is the Elonian Elementalist outfit
---
Its my favourite area of the map, but I couldn't take any good shots without something just getting in the way
---
Gosh I remember how "Now I really am six feet tall!" cracked me up in Auric Basin meta
---
Always  misread it as "Less violence. More violence, I say." I thought it was a funny critique of the economic incentive for war. Now the line is ruined for me.
---
DEATH. GOOD.
---
Who would put an septicaliper in an opticaliper receptacle. Lunacy!

Let's play guess the zone the game where you guess the zone based solely on annoying NPC lines. Lets begin.

There's a pretty decent RP community! Be sure to [check out GW2RP.](https://www.guildwars2roleplayers.com/)
---
There is actually a pretty neat trick you can do.  Charge your jump with the spring, before it ends charging, press the dismount hot key, you will be launched upwards and unmounted, then you can either glide or mount the griffon.  No need for the skygate mount.
---
I figured this out before but thanks for reminding me.
---
"NOW THIS IS A FIND!"
---
Yes but Aurene talked thanks to Caithe. Im not mad she can talk, im unsettled due she can talk from the blue, *alone*. She didn't talked without Caithe before and now she will talk everytime at everyone. There is a gap between the first time she talks by Caithe and the begining of the chapter that its not being explained.  
---
I know about Rox story being worked on but the microdialogue didn't helped at all, was just 2 random sentences in the middle of other stuff.  
---
Lmao jimmy neutron? Anyways, she sounds way too more childish this chapter than last one for example (tone of voice at least).
---
Nice! But for long swords, the bottom hand needs to be closer to the pommel.
---
Its what gives leverage and the manuverability to make important cuts and parys.
---
Awesome, thanks!

Is that a full set of Elite Armour? How much does that cost and how long does it take?
---
Yeah, they seem to have a quite big variety of drink. The one I tried was horrible tho...
---
I’ve got deals you won’t BELIEVE
---
They are very short, about four or five of them strewn around the map. You'll likely find squads in LFG.
---
This Rose has thorns, and here they are!
---
It does look really out of place, visually - which is odd, given how much work they put into making Kourna and Jahai blend to Vabbi.
---
But it *does* make sense, in the context of the story. 🤔
---
What's this about an official post? I missed this.
---
Here is [some sale history](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/Expansion_Sales) though it might be missing a few. In general it goes on sale every few months now.
---
It's just something you'll have to embrace.  I have similar specs and same results.  Division 2 runs at 70FPS minimum at 1440 resolution and looks 10 billion times better.  It's just an old engine and it runs poorly.
---
As a side note, I was blown out of my socks when I saw Black Desert Online running at similar speeds.  Kinda looks like GW2 but vastly superior.  Sadly, I hate that game and love GW2.
---
Flipping the market
---
If you are new, there is one simple rule in this game:
---
If something looks remotely good, you can be assured that it is a $20 payshop item.
---
If it looks shit, its available ingame
---
That's actually not true. Immortal simply means you can't die. Different stories and myths have different interpretations of immortality, but true literal immortality would mean that nothing at all could kill you.
---
You're right. I just found that out today after not playing much for a few days after finishing the story. I guess a better thing to hope for is that they remove the timegates from between the 5 separate collections, especially if some already have heavy timegates.
---
And gw2 is another story where immortality is fake. Proved by Joko himself.
---
Just like brothers, i loved it.
---
Tybalt you lazy bot! GOLD?! Trigger!
---
I don't think you understood /u/kalamari__'s idea. Or at least you understood it in a different way than I did but then you should have replied to him, not me.
---
&gt; 3 available themes
---
I'm talking about duplicating each existing legendary into 3 similar ones with small changes (mostly colors), just like dawn/dusk/eternity. No way it's about fusing 2 existing totally different weapons into a 3rd one, it would make no sense.
---
"Thanks for pitching in."
---
Return to Orr
---
I think if any game can be artistically bold enough without ripping off Lovecraftian tentacles just because we go underwater, its GW2. That said, it might still be one of the inspirations once we actually go down that alleyway.
---
Let's say I created a character at launch with the name Scarlet, should I now face consequences having created the character because they decided to use the name in season 1?
---
Same for different variations of Gwen for instance. They are names based on lore, but at the time those characters were created the names were not relevant in contemporary Guild Wars 2. That rule, and related rules, is intended to prevent players from deliberately misleading or confusing playersor infringing on third-party copyrights as someone noted.
---
So yes there are cases where that rule may not apply to names used previously where they might apply if they were created today. Granted I have no doubt that Anet would forcibly rename a character with such a name that knowingly engaged in misleading players.
---
This one is the most annoying one for me. I spent a lot of time testing out classes with the character boost trial and I almost pulled my hair out. I had to turn dialogue off while doing it lol
---
"Let's see the color of your coin!"
---
"More people should learn to bargain!"
---
Oh! I didn't see you there! "
---
Is there a way to disable the display of names while hovering near them ? I mean I already have all names hidden for immersion but names still appear in the vicinity of my cursor/gaze. I would only want to ever see names when I target the player/npc/mob directly.
---
Damn your eyes...
---
Laughed way too hard at this!

Thats the one thing that saddens me as well with humanoid tonics such as this one.

There is a guild that runs HoT meta train daily Mon - Fri 12:00 PM UTC.  Check LFG they're quite organized.

That's the thing, bro was asked to pick for them. However we'll try to let them pick for themselves whatever appeals to them the most.

I love how you see this dotted around but in DS someone says it and 4 people all reply Thanks
---
Unless you have bad ping and end up locked into the dismount leap all the way to the ground. On the plus side, I discovered that you take no fall damage while performing that leap, which is a bloody cool way to jump off a cliff down into a fight below.
---
I had a chance to experience the Skyboga as well!
---
This whole relationship with caithe makes no sense. She should be the champion, not commander.
---
People generally don't recommend condition builds for open world.  If I had to answer I'd lean towards Dagger/Torch + Shortbow Soulbeast.    The Kalla Renegade build wouldn't necessarily be bad for small-group play either.  However,  I tend to think that Soulbeast is a little more fluid than Renegade is -- I wouldn't want to play Renegade nearly as much without boons like quickness or alacrity.

How to do it?
---
Really strange and really frustrating, I have tried through the fence now about 35 times and for about 30 minutes, none of the spill placements work what I have tried through the fence. I have literally tried every inch, the fire is blocked by the fence every single time. If you try to go around the fence, there is not enough oil to make the connection, Skill #1 "Spill Oil" does nothing when you need those last 2 spills of oil. Seems that there is some kind of a bug that prevents the progression from some players, so making a bug report.

Wtf. Pretty sure this guy is a serial killer.

How many times are you going to post this

Life is a trial. Koda the judge, kodan the jury.

Scourge is meta in WvW

Reaper is the best spec for open world because of how tanky it is even with the most offensive gear stat.

For Raids: Power reaper, condi scourge, heal scourge. You can fill any role besides boon support.

oh right, haha i forgot not every class gets soldier's, just most of them.

I'm making a T1 legendary at the moment. Sell only what you don't need. I've been keeping all my T6's and selling my T5's and I basically break even, but with more T6 mats and crafting stuff. It works out much cheaper than buying the T6's and you come out with a *slight* profit from the ectoplasm and other stuff.
---
You need to add things permanently to your HoM in gw:en.
---
The “hero” elite armors are drops from the challenge missions so you need to farm them and upgrade the armors before you add the hero to the pedestals in the HoM.
---
After that they show on the list.
---
yes
---
I do because I'm not saving them for anything and they net a fair chunk of VM.

Why do people keep downvoting this? 😕

[obligatory PrntScr Comment] \#2

Ok, but his dialog still happens in the past. The maps are frozen in time, but that doesn't mean that ANet can't change some content to fit the story better.

You mean Sebblub?
---
You have to believe in the heart of the cards for it to work.
---
It’s because you dyed the scyscale blue and called it a Aurene cosplay. Not really upvote worthy as it’s nothing creative at all.
---
either is fine, yeh sometimes you walk away from a mob at 50% and let the condis do the work, but its pretty good against strong vets, champs and legendaries
---
for open world i prefer trap condi soulbeast (theres a bunch of different stuff you can take, ill just be talking about what i take), provides pretty good sustain thanks to poison lifestealing, good but sometimes tricky aoe (some big stuff like wyverns or hydras wont necessarily trigger traps even if you're in dagger hitting range; you need to actually stand inside them) and i run a low defense build with no stunbreaks (viper nest/vulture stance/flame trap) but dont run into problems with it because the damage is pretty damn high (vipers trap is over 18k poison damage, without taking into account the direct and lifesteal damage, on a 16s cooldown)... CC is a bit lacking though (only consistent CC i have available is shortbow, i can swap to a lightning wyvern, but does come at a loss from the BB merge; which i rarely find worth it)
---
my condi renegade leans heavily on mallyx leap (about 12-18k torment damage, demonic defiance and maniacal persistence gives another 5-8k torment every 5s, but im not super keen on it because the self torment locks me in combat for longer than id like annoying often), and actually i play it very similarly to my condi soulbeast (planting high DoT aoes in melee range with little regard)... still it feels a tad more risky than my soulbeast (despite having a stunbreak thanks to invocation), a fun rune choice you can make though is [runes of tormenting](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Rune_of_Tormenting) which has no ICD on the 6th bonus, so a single mallyx leap equals a lot of healing; this does become a build consideration though because with vipers youll drastically overcap torment duration; so you could go sinister/viper mix, though this still comes with a drop off of your burns (mace#2 and citadel bombardment... which i only tend to use in shiro tbh, i prefer keeping my mallyx energy for leaps)
---
Yes, I was afraid for this,m. This is the first time iI did it without subtitles. I'm looking for a way to do it without puttibg hours and hours in subtitles
---
This still anoys me, and what is weirder is that they kept some of the old statues.  I always thought that lore explanasion could be the rising of Orr, they rediscovered the statue design from there and copied it because they like them more... But then there are some places that weren't visited since Orr rose, and they still have new design.

Is this the dude? If yes, none if his dialog indicates that it's 1330
---
I'm imagining it. What do I do now?
---
that is weird and rly sad. for me it always feel more like reddit just hate me for some reason. i mean yes pvp content gets hate and mesmer gets hate ususally a lot tho but i felt liek a lot of other ppl posting they content dont get punished that hard. soim usually not surprised to get downvoted into hell but on a guide its kinda strange and sad when i think abotu how much work is put into doing it. thx for your feedback tho &lt;3
---
Both griffon and skyscale have a mastery ability that lets you mount them in the air.
---
Looks crazy weird, you can even see a bit of blue skin on the forehead. Makes me wonder if faces are loaded in separately and this is a bug. But then again, you seem to be able to recreate it whenever u want. Looks like a fotoshop job gone wrong :D
---
Ah ok I see. Thanks for your explanation!
---
Doesn't feel like it HAS to be 1330+, imo
---
Mortals are not inmune to death. Inmortals are. IF an inmortal being is somehow 'transformed' to mortal it does not mean the inmortality is vulnerable to death, at contrary. But if a inmortal being is removed of inmortality and its killed due its new mortality, then its its not inmortality failure.
---
I already have 2 level 80 characters on my account and there is no sale available the moment I reach that level. Then there is nothing for me to do but to wait. So I suggest go buy them both so that you can still progress even if you're a casual gamer the moment you finish the core game.
---
Out of curiosity, what does GW2 being a casual game have to do with your post getting downvotes?
---
People are allowed to express a negative opinion. Get off your high horse.
---
I do not recall ever having seen anything stating that the Gods fed off the prayers of mortals, especially considering they existed long before there were any mortals that existed. 
---
The Ares bit I'm having trouble even confirming exactly what it is you're referring to in the Iliad. 
---
And Overly Sarcastic Productions has a video on Pan in which they explain that Pan being dead was likely just one man's mistranslation of what someone was trying to tell him.
---
Dude, what did you want them to do about the Charr female PC voice? Not have the PC talk at all? VA changes are a huge thing, of course, but the moment they decided to do that (and believe me, changing a VA is not a decision you take lightly), the only proper way to do it was just to replace voice lines and act as if that had always been the Charr female PC voice...
---
As for the fanservice, this is just your opinion. Like, the thing between Rox and Braham isn't fanservice, it's litterally character development? Those characters were friends, kinda drifted away for many reasons, but they found each other due to how things turned out. Would you rather have them not even acknowledge each other? Which do you think would be worse?
---
And I'm not even gonna adress the "vore fetish" bit, it made me feel dumber for even reading it.
---
I currently main Holosmith. Personal fun factor aside, how would you compare the 2, dps wise (pve and wvw)?
---
RIP Silverwastes for everyone except base-game players.
---
Quick, everyone! Farm the shit out of Dragonfall before Anet nerfs it into the ground!
---
Yeah it's ambiguous enough that it can work with most contexts (outside of finishing the latest episode of course).
---
For what it's worth, I really enjoyed your wvw video. Great choice in music! I usually don't bother watching those types of videos but I watched to the end, reminded me of old school wow BG montages.
---
isnt that just the golem´s sound? that mettalic clunk
---
God these comments are great but now that I hear and feel and relive all these lines all at the same time I hate you all haha
---
I dont even raid but to them its like getting a content drop once every 6 months to a year. Maybe the raid community is small because people are leaving due to lack of content like WvW players.
---
I’m an older vet player too (started way back in gw1).
---
I will only say this to add to your comment...
---
“Nothing fast or easy is rewarding and Nothing truly rewarding will ever be easy and fast”
---
I enjoy this mount acquisition so far (I know it’s tough on the instant gratification gen but putting your time and effort into something slowly is its own kind of reward)
---
And you can bet after this effort you will really love that skyscale a lot more then other mounts (doesn’t mean you will use it most.. just that you will love and fondly remember the days everyone bitching about right now)
---
Since when do you have them?
---
It's been a while since I've really done the story content. The PoF and HoT story content won't lock you out of any maps. They'll help you with mastery unlocks, cosmetics, etc. though. In general, so long as we're not talking Living World Seasons, you shouldn't be locked out of any content, other than achievements, a couple of collections and the like. It's up to you whether or not you really want the cosmetics and other items.

Welcome back to Guild Wars. I do hope that you have an enjoyable time with whatever you end up doing.

Dragonhunter/Firebrand, Scourge/Reaper, BoonChrono, Renegade/Herald
---
Thats what my alt accounts always get on creation. The Renegade/Herald is my healer toon, you might be better served with a druid if you pug a lot on EU... for whatever reason, EU pugs are very much married to double druid comp in raids and chrono+druid comp in fractals - guess they like to keep things challenging.
---
Dragonhunter is my power dps toon, power firebrand for quickness in fractals or raid.
---
Scourge is my condi dps toon.
---
Chrono because it will forever stay in the meta.
---
I typed into google, what kind of game is path of exile. Answer came up, action rpg, not MMO.  Guild Wars 2 comes up with online role playing game. They're considered different genres and not just by me. Sorry if you don't agree.
---
You'll need to complete the PoF storyline if you want to get the Griffon mount.
---
Wish I could say anything but that's just how it is with the game sometimes.
---
Turn off player names, reflections(it's just water), char model limit to at least medium and turn shadows down a notch.
---
Thats even worse man, the title and by extension the image is spoiler.
---
But Kralk's torment is showed as Branded creature, something that shows Kralkatorrik's magic itself, not only Death, Mind and Fire magic tormented him, but also his own magic did.
---
thank
---
What the shit. This is amazing!
---
I also looked on the companies website, which is where google got it from. They're not calling it an MMORPG. They're calling it an action rpg which is a different animal. Talked to my son just now, he recognizes those as a different genre.  Not sure why you're so anxious to disprove me.
---
I not only have played Path of Exile I'm a founding member. It's nothing like WoW or Guild Wars 2, which have more in common. It's just a completely different feel. You may not agree, and that's okay. The company themselves aren't calling it an MMORPG though.
---
Thanks to this it makes everything much more clearer now. TY

&gt; Legions vs Ebonhawke situation
---
Wasn't that a long time later? I'm not sure Gwen was still alive or actively adventuring when Legions came to storm Ebonhawke. I'm sure Legions fighting Flame took a while
---
Hey.
---
That is a good question and a lot of people will give you different answers. Seeing as you don't have HoT yet, my favourite class is a bit of a ways off for you, but I'm sure you'll get there eventually. I can mostly speak about open world meta, dungeon and fractal content myself.

My favourite class to play would be Necromancer, Reaper elite specialization \[HoT\]. You can play this in a lot of ways. The profession has great damage output and an equally as great an ability to survive, without foregoing damage output. The Shroud mechanic adds another layer of protection. 
---
Next up I'll have to most likely go with Ranger, Soulbeast elite specialization \[PoF\]. Great sustainability due to the variety in pet skills and very much suited for straight power DPS as well as Condition Damage. 
---
Another versatile class would be Guardian, Firebrand elite specialization \[PoF\]. Can be played in a lot of different ways, from Condition Damage DPS to full on support. Also has a decent amount of utility due to the additional skills that you can switch between on the fly. 
---
To be honest every class is viable in some capacity, it just comes down to your preferred play style and the group of people you're playing with. If you feel like going for support Mesmer, Chronomancer elite specialization \[HoT\] would be a decent pick. If you feel like playing something fairly unique go for a full damage Engineer, Holomancer elite specialization \[PoF\]. A lot of my friends play both of these and are having a lot of fun.
---
Hope that this helps and enjoy your leveling :) Heart of Thorns is great fun as well. 
---
I will try when I can. Beetle is my favorite mount and I was bit sad I couldn't use it for an extended period in the map.
---
so since LW S3 he is just an empty square?
---
Hhhheeeeeeeelllpp
---
Wow, it's almost like they have paths that teach you something.
---
Underworld: Mount up to test Soul Binders on floating Branded debris.
---
Burning Forest: Use Eternal Embers to destroy Branded turrets.
---
Recently finish heart of thorns after procrastinating for a few years here. The story was meh but the challenge from the increasingly challenging battles kept me going. Definitely worth to get the free ascended caladbolg tho, cool skin and title
---
I suppose i need to translate since some emojis aren’t universal:
---
LW S3 - *One angry boi*
---
Path of fire - *A slighty annoyed boi*
---
LW S4 - *A very drunk boi*
---
Thanks!
---
I want to do fractals/raids, but casually if that's possible/makes sense. Despite people not taking necros to raids, is it really so hard to get a raid group as a necro?
---
Wow!
---
In general getting both Expansions won't have an impact on you unless you start them and start unlocking things. Sales do happen from time to time. Enjoy your mapping and welcome back to Guild Wars.
---
Think this might be the 3rd time for 50% sale so I'm 80% certain there will be another in the future.
---
I know your face from my dream.
---
Asking the important question
---
how is it slightly spoiler? that aurene is still around is THE major spoiler for everyone who hasnt played the episode yet?
---
Great tips, thanks! Yes I'm sure most people (myself included) will adopt the RIBA like style of tag events and move on once they're done with their achievements.
---
P.S. I love the beetle track, and I've probably done it more times than some of the actual circuits when I was farming bridge events lol.
---
They’re saying that anyone who is super weary of time hating should probably be carrying a few charged quartz because this is not the first time they’ve been used in a collection.
---
But if you have zero and really really want it *right now*, aside from popping gathering boosts and hitting all the quartz nodes for a charged quartz as a rare drop, you can also buy certain festival bags and open them en masse to get them as drops.
---
They’re not looking the other way, they’ve made an official response and you can expect another.
---
I'd say that both elite specs are definitely viable depending on where you play them. I don't tend to look at meta builds, but from my own experience both Elite Specs hold up in all 3 game modes.
---
Regarding WvW: Scourge is great for big Zerg fights, whereas Reaper is a fun class to roam around the map with.
---
Regarding PvP: Both classes are great and play very differently.
---
Regarding PvE: Scourge is often used as a support class in Fractals nowadays, other than that Reaper is pretty much my favourite for anything open world/fractal/dungeon related. Reaper has great DPS and sustainability. Reaper is also very forgiving.
---
Overall I'd recommend giving both a shot. Reaper is definitely my favourite profession specialization in the game.
---
Enjoy being a Necromancer :)
---
Wing 7 will definitely be using gaeting crystals.
---
Ohh yes. I will definitely buy HoT just for the reaper. I've seen many reapers doing Boss events so it only means they are really good on that aspect. Thanks for the reply this helps a lot. TY

&gt; I also looked on the companies website, which is where google got it from. They're not calling it an MMORPG. They're calling it an action rpg which is a different animal. 
---
You can call a bike an airplane but its still a bike.
---
it is massive, multiplayer, played online, its a roleplaying game, with grind, leveling, crafting, loot hunting, buildmaking, customization, short and long term goals, rare drops, earlygame and endgame.
---
Can you tell me why its not an mmo? What are the criteria its missing?
---
&gt;I not only have played Path of Exile I'm a founding member.
---
So... why did you need to look it up on google and the company's website?
---
&gt;The company themselves aren't calling it an MMORPG though.
---
You can call battlefield a dating simulator. Does that mean its not a shooter anymore?

Holosmith is very strong, and very durable.
---
It's one of the reason why it is played alot in WvW, PvP AND Raids.

The only thing to overcome is the skill factor, because a bad Holosmith is horrible and it shows very well.

Try to use borderless window mode instead of full-screen. Have very bad GPS on full screen as well for some reason

Greatsword with Trahearne legend, summoning mordremoth-type minions or something.

People were asking me why I was waiting to get the skyscale. Here it is :)
---
I haven't had troubles, tho I barely try actively. There are few posts time to time here that they get kicked because they are necros. It's not common, but it can happen.
---
Casually it's super fine. I regularly top dps in those groups but I doubt I'd top dps if I was doing some minmax speedrun clear. There just are limits to the dps reaper/scourge can do.
---
As usual, good necro is better than shitty weaver. Or whatever else. It's all about players skill, and I'd say with practice you will do good.
---
"Nice work, Rytlock. You're one of the good charr." 
---
lmfao
---
I like it because we are actually hatching and raising our skyscale in a more realistic way instead of one day. So I hope Anet sticks to their guns on this one
---
For MMO's its not about getting your money's worth its about getting your times worth, its why the longevity of a MMO is so important and how long it can keep you engaged. If a game cant keep its veteran players engaged new players might stay clear and go to another game that can just look at WoW with bfa.
---
Just buy them now.... the chances you will see a 60% off bundle before you beat the core game is little to zero. (It probably won’t be 60-75% off until it’s basically dead game same as how they sell gw1 so cheap.... but gw1 is from 2006 so it should be dirt cheap by now right?)
---
50% off will be the best sale you will find for awhile so my advice is (no matter how casual)
---
Go ahead and get the expansions.. mounts and all sorts of quality of life improvements (like glider) are right around the corner!!
---
We are older and have 2 kids so I fully understand the busy life thing (that’s also why you should just buy them and be done.. now you only play when you want and don’t watch for sales or websites in your free time)
---
Play casual, or be hard core it won’t matter because the mounts and some quality of life improvements from PoF/HoT will make your limited play time more productive and thus.. more fun (imho)
---
So if you got the money just get it (even if you won’t be starting it for awhile it will be far more convenient to already have them unlocked)
---
OH and if you enjoy WvW as a game format you must own PoF to get the WvW exclusive mount (The Warclaw)
---
So Nike said it best.... “just do it”

Tuesday is the earliest. Its troublesum and riding left. Troublesum will be unlocked tomorrow for some. If there is no more timegate.

My favourite I noticed was the spelling of between. Betwix or something to that nature was put and I was staring for ages at how they managed to completely misspell a common word.

Depending on what is needed to make them.. they might increase in value.  Who knows we might need a stack of 250 of every single superior or something..

He just pulled a [Keiran Thackeray](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Keiran_Thackeray). Unlike us, players, NPCs are not bound to profession due to gameplay reasons. Drastic changes or experiences in their life can result into them changing profession. Like when Keiran found his inner resolve to lead others after his crossing of the Maguuma which translated into him switching from a Ranger into a Paragon in GW1.
---
Also Cannach is a master of transformations/ adaptation, just look how he changed his look from his young self in our visions of Caithe's past or pre-South Sun incident :P
---
Take heed! I haven't taken leave of my senses!
---
None, only kills
---
Btw meta maps events gives absurd ammounts of exp, so you should have no problems, at least its not as grindy as hot masteries were when hot was launched.
---
Try Mystic Chromatic Ooze there, you turn completely red-orange.
---
I survived the Provisioner Token timegate, twice. I’ve survived the ascended armor crafting, before the stuff was everywhere. I survived the celestial stat timegate. This timegate is nothing. I didn’t have the mount last week, I’ll have the mount next week. 
---
Timegates slow down the players that blow through everything then whine they have nothing to do later on. Relax and play either a different game, or something else in this game, while you’re waiting!

Pocket Raptors https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pocket_Raptor The one that kills most new players have only one skill which is bite. This are not hard to deal with you just need to understand them.
---
Now PoF

Water Djinn https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Veteran_Water_Djinn

Have several skill which all hits like a rock if not avoided. They also have defensive skills and break bars. 
---
Awakened Abomination https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Veteran_Awakened_Abomination
---
This guy have 6 skills, a break bar and are unkilleble at range and a whirling aura. 
---
Awakened Ravager https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Veteran_Awakened_Ravager
---
This guy have 4 skills in which all can kill you if not avoided. He also have defense skill were he gain boons when attacked at range. 
---
Forged Forerunner https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Veteran_Forged_Forerunner have 5 skills and hits like a rock.
---
In Hot the density of mobs is high but they are not like in PoF were the forged for example are moving in larger groups and if you pull one you pull 5 more at least and all in that group are had to deal with if you are new.
---
Mind you the above is written for what was stated in the topic as in new players perspective. So for me who played all of it for years i have no issues to move in any of the areas or deal with any of the mobs because i have learned how to counter then. In HoT you simply need to stop that one skill that is hard hitting, the rest is just fine. In PoF you need to stop several had hitting skills and be aware of the defense skills and the chain casts and counter that. Mobs in PoF is by far more intelligent then they are in HoT. Not saying HoT mobs are easy for new players but the reason we say PoF is easier is because you can avoid the mobs overall due to big maps and mounts.
---
I feel furious!
---
Yeah, for gear Dragonfall is the clear winner, just wanted to know about VM, since I've been thinking of getting max level enrichments because of the longevity this map will most likely have, end of season plus gear farm and all that.
---
Appreciate the effort, only one flaw. He doesn't have that much account value on his accounts. He just plans to have that much one day

Enjoy :)

---
I have 7600 hours in gw2 with 16 legendaries.  I've put a looooot  of time into that amazing game, its thr game I've played most.
---
Loving story content is short and easy.  Despite the hate HoT got I loved it.  Pof bored me and I cleared the story and such on a single sitting
---
&gt; I specifically mean the fact sylvari are shown to have souls (e.g. The Departing) which should be almost if not entirely impossible to "assemble" from random plant matter. Your average anorganic dragon minion also shows a fair bit more intelligence/complex instincts than the corresponding elementals though that could be due to hivemind control.
---
We really have zero understanding of how souls are formed. Or what souls are, to be honest. Or what the Dream is. Maybe sylvari can have souls solely because they come from the Dream, which has a heavy similarity to the Mists.
---
And as I said, sylvari have a **drastic** number of differences from any other dragon minion out there. Even mordrem. They're also the only dragon minions (sans Glint who is the scion of an Elder Dragon thus also unique) who have souls. And even that was a very recent development that probably came from the apparently recent writing style of ArenaNet: Write what is cool, think about ramifications of such later.
---
&gt; Plus Glint and the Pale Tree have considerable intelligence (Glint explicitly shown to have a soul/spirit but not confirmed to have been synthesised from inanimate matter IIRC) and other champions such as the Claw(s) of Jormag or the Shatterer are implied to be fairly smart. Granted I don't think we've ever encountered a free uncorrupted elemental anywhere close to their power but for the ones we do see "dumb as rocks" can almost be taken literally.
---
Intelligence in dragon minions was confirmed in the Order of Whispers PS narrative to be caused by the Elder Dragon giving them more magic. Not what they were made out of. Human branded are just as dumb as branded earth elementals. This is why only dragon champion/lieutenants - such as Glint, The Shatterers, and Claws of Jormag - are intelligent, regardless of their origin.
---
&gt; So if EDs can seemingly create both intelligence and souls "from scratch" (the latter possibly limited to the Mind domain) what exactly stops them/their minions from using these abilities to reproduce? Regular lifeforms still need food to do that too and there does seem to be a distinction between inanimate corrupted matter and fully functional minions formed from it.
---
We don't have any evidence of Elder Dragons creating souls from scratch. Intelligence, sure, but what does that have to do with anything?
---
As for what prevents minions from reproducing... how about the biological organs required for such. That said, nothing stops them from corrupting things into new minions (as I've repeatedly stated).  Corrupting things into new minions != reproduction.
---
Minions created by other minions, however, are ultimately no different than any other minion unless created by a purified minion (as I've repeatedly stated). If I were to point to anything for why there is a difference, it would be that purified minions have free will, and so do the 'minions' they can create (be it from plants, earth, or living beings).

/u/Kunaviech :  Wtf. Pretty sure this guy is a serial killer.

I mean it's amaze me a LoL / hearthstone player posting on Gw2 again totally out of the odds after 2-3 years. From Austria, why you just don't go pro on one of these, instead of commenting lawl.
---
I support earning it at your own pace. But we have a lot of “EK” players in GW2, that can’t understand “if you finish it now, you won’t have it later”. So good players like you get punished for it. Which sucks ass, but like, it’s whatever (personally). I didn’t have it before, I’ll get it eventually. This game is super chill and laid back like that.
---
(Timegates still stupid af, I just don’t bother worrying about them. Ain’t got that energy)
---
While the enrichments are never a bad thing they are not that powerful on dragonfall like on istan or thunderhead for example. Many events in dragonfall can be dragged out due to failing the mechanics. And every event that can be dragged out on purpose will not reward you with loot or xp from mobs.
---
LMFAO
---
The drastic rectangularity of the map is offputting, so is how damn close the map's knockback border is.
---
I'm am very aware, the map just shows such promising longevity that i think it warrants buying them nonetheless
---
My skimmer has basically been set free already.
---
It’s totally stupid, but our player base kinda is too... bingegame then complain. Gotta hold their hand sometimes to make them see to take their time... (which is stupid, would rather do at my pace. But we’re talking the unresponsible gamers)
---
I would suggest getting enough mastery points from the PoF story to get canyon jumping for the raptor and high jump for springer. They make HoT quite a bit less frustrating. You're going to hit a choke point on mastery points at some point because certain mastery unlocks are required to get more mastery points. You get the initial ones from completing story chapters.
---
If you meant “betwixt”, it’s just an archaic form of “between”.
---
To enhance replayability kinda like how timegating keeps us playing longer. /s
---
&gt; it doesn't play itself and rewards diversity and teamwork.
---
Wait.. all this time I could have just set my game on autopilot and it could have given me dhuum cm without effort? Fuck.. I wasted so much time with my team trying to get the kill. Where is the autopilot? I can't find it in the options.
---
Oh good gods im so glad its not just me that thinks the map view of it is offputting and cringy lol
---
You missed a couple. There's one if the escort gets to the bridge before it's been repaired. There's also one where Gwen and Rytlock have an argument, she's still rather bitter about being enslaved as a child and Rytlock counters it with how the humans treated the Charr when they arrived on Tyria.
---
I beg your pardon! The beetle is the best wall climber! (No seriously, it’s hilarious when it does!! A guildie and I have used it to climb walls in the aerodrome and land on top of shelves!!!)
---
How Balthazar showed up?
---
You should probably replay the story and pay more attention. It was told quite clearly how he showed up back in PoF.
---
That sounds amazing. I wish this was official or I was on an EU server. May I see the old footage, if you don't mind.
---
Hello,
---
I'm a new player (started yesterday)
---
Currently I'm playing F2P, but I saw that both expansions are in sale.
---
Are sales frequent  ? Or should I buy them while they're cheaper ?
---
Ps: Is the deluxe POF worth it ? It cost 12€50 more than the standart
---
Did you pay attention to the story at all..?
---
His name is Bob, by the way.
---
 Yes and NO, when we say it looks out of place its not because its location , its because it looks unnatural, too square, and even the  map view like whole world map, when you look at it it is a perfect rectangle. Not even the gods of geometry and gods of geography working together would make fallen debri randomly fall into a perfect rectangle. It neede something to remove that unnatural symetry off of it, even if it was inaccesible with invisible walls but like extra island parts and such to just break that  visual apart
---
Actually no I think season 5 will deal with trying to fix the mists. Just cause Kralk is gone doesn't mean the mists are safe he did a lot of damage to them. I think in season 5 we will see the mists blend more into Tyria and maybe at the finale Steve wakes up leading us to Cantha, or Primordus and Jormag wake up and we get the far shiverpeaks and the depths of Tyria. Or we go to the Isles of Janthir.
---
When was he ever a guardian?
---
He was always a W/En.
---
Well, springer is vertical, raptor is horizontal, Skyscale seems to be vertical diagonal. So something that’s too far for the verticality of the springer, and too high for the raptor. Of course you could mix bond of faith with max bunny then griffin. But that’s a lot of work to just not “Skyscale” over.
---
&gt; the balance of magic is even more unstable
---
Incorrect. The magic released by the death of Kralkatorric was absorbed by Aurene.
---
???? "child" lawl that gets me some giggles, I've been playing games before you're even born to this world son, let's assume on the way you're so toxic you're probably 18 to 21 years old max.
---
Secondary:
---
Why I would give an excuse, I asked you straight forward about your "API Key", just to confirm something?
---
Thirdly:
---
I don't care about "AP". Lol I was just assuming you had less AP. which doesn't mean anything. You could have less and have more I was targeting about "GOLD" alone not AP.
---
Off-topic: Anyway son did you learn what does 0x0 and NOP means or still need some lessons ?
---
If you purchase the expansions you start getting daily quests in those zones. I don't think anyone has mentioned that yet. The 2g and spirit shards every day are things that you'll be happy to have later on, and if you're doing content in order you will be missing it.
---
Straight up I'm a little muddy on the timeline so I looked it up. The GW1 and GW2 wikis state that the Ebon Vanguard took over Ebonhawke in 1080AE and the siege started ever since the fall of Ascalon City which would have happened at the same time as the Foefire which was 1090AE. So Gwen still would have been alive when the siege started, probably in her early to mid thirties.
---
Didn’t we just get a new map, story chapter, achievements and mount like, within the past week?
---
That is 100% incorrect. The xp booster , birthday / celebration booster , etc all give a flat increase to xp earned, not just kill xp increase. Whether that is from events, or even gathering.
---
There are eternal embers dispensers at the shrine and the burning forest camp.
---
Especially because there are collections. First thing I did was fly around the sides looking for the scales, only to be constantly reminded how closely I had to hug the land. This plus the awkward rectangle in the map is really disappointing.
---
Any booster that says +xp% . So xp booster , birthday / celebration booster ( but these are way more valuable for wvw levelling and shouldn't be wasted) , heroic booster. But also , kill xp can be very rewarding. +15% from food , +10% from utility , 50-100% from booster , plus kill streak bonus on some boosters. Plus mobe give more xp the longer they are alive. That bonus can triple or quadruple the xp. 
---
Also , not a "booster" but guild xp buff is 10% to all xp , and there is an xp amulet enrichment
---
I achieve things. I'm an achiever!

---
No, he did not.
---
The sales happen occasionally , but -50% is the best you'll find. And the expansions are 100% totally worth it. If you are going to continue playing , definitely get them unless there is another reason you're on the fence ( like money issues ) . Even if it takes you some time to really get into them , gliding and mounts work in the base game zones and I definitely wouldn't want to go back to not having them.
---
Yeah I hate it when the banker in captain's airship keeps threatening me.  
---
''You break it I break you''
---
Honestly I think they're a good mindless gold farm from the mini meta achievement. Also aether path drops an exotic weapon once per day that can sell well too.
---
since others already talked about meta, I'll add some nonmeta stuff that might be a bit easier to get into at first. assuming you're all fairly new, you might wanna do open world, story instances, dungeons, and later fractals together.
---
* one thief or scrapper (needs to be 80 though, thief already gets stealth way earlier) will greatly help with stealth. can be useful in dungeons and very few fractals.
---
* mesmer and later chrono for general utility, like portals, pulls etc. and reflects, which are very useful in dungeons. as chrono you also get quickness and alacrity at the cost of some utility.
---
* warrior for banners, cc and DPS. can also give 25 might for the whole group, which is nice if you don't have a druid yet.
---
* guardian has good utility with reflects, pulls, party blocks, stability etc and can adjust to many situations. * if you want a healer (before endgame you won't really need one) people tend to go for a druid (as it has good offensive buffs besides healing), so maybe a dps ranger as a start and when you get to content where you need heals, gear it as a druid.
---
once you reach endgame, you might want to optimize further, but those classes are more than capable to easily clear any 5man content. obviously meta comps will be faster but generally more risky, imho, as this way you can get a lot of defensive utility by sacrificing a bit of damage from some players.
---
most classes can bring various degrees of utility and so long as you don't run duplicates, chances are you will have every kind of tool you'll need anyway. say if someone wants to take a necro instead of a guard, you lose the blocks and reflects, but can run the blood traitline and get a bit of sustain for the group with vampiric aura and can ress downed players very quickly. until they get scourge and reaper I'd say it's generally less useful than a core guard, but they are not useless.
---
I heard about these, but they don't want to trigger :(. If i can trigger them, I will add them to the normal ambient in the map.
---
Some are kills, some are all game types. I had a few of the old ones that were definitely increasing the amount of exp from the auric meta and story chapters.
---
pay attention to the story next time
---
I used to farm silverwastes. Just got good at tuning it out

THERE IS A LIVING WORLD 4!?! DUDE! SPOILER!
---
/s
---
He's right thought, spoilers slip through titles despite the 28 days rule. And it's not enforced.
---
When he said to let his hair grow back I agreed and thought, we better leave that whole arc behind us.
---
Since it's the best people may have bought the node a long time ago.
---
I would be more okay with that than what we have now. Having a daily reset time-gate and only being able to play once a week means that I won't have the skyscale for quite a while despite having a lot of free time when I can actually play the game.
---
Time-gates are a no no because they conflict with people's lives. I'm not taking off work just so I can feed a virtual tomagachi. I need my job so I can afford utilities to play the damn game in the first place. And I'm sure I have it easy compared to a lot of other people. 
---
So realistically and mechanically, this would make sense as it creates a sort of catchup mechanics for players who cant make their resets and it also creates more incentive for playing the content rather than just logging in, throwing some food at a baby dragon, then logging out till the next day.
---
If this is about current episode then I agree. If this is about anything before current episode then I strongly disagree. Anything older than 28 days is not considered as a spoiler. Dealt with it and  don't visit this subreddit until you catch up.
---
Racing scarf you get from Beetle Racing
---
It is definitely enforced. But the mods are people, with (I assume) lives, they are not sitting here 24/7. But spoilery titles (and not marked spoiler threads) does disappear quite fast.

The thing is that we already have fire themed legend. How you can solve this?
---
Report them and we'll nuke 'em. We're trying to nuke them as soon as we see them too so other people don't see them, but we can't be here 24/7. Best thing everyone can do is report them, enough reports and the post gets hidden until a mod can address it.
---
&gt; Even mentioning a characters name can be a spoiler because we know that character lives until LW4
---
You're insane.
---
I hope not. There are plenty of themes and characters that can be used. Fire twice in a row? Sounds so meh.
---
I hope so! It's 2019, what kind of man doesn't at least apply a little foundation and blusher, and pluck their brows and thicken their lashes and put on just a hint of lip gloss? Honestly.
---
"I offer the best prices around" says the bank npc, offering his service for free. He isn't lying.
---
The Forgotten cleansing his heart but not his mind could make sense. It would explain why Glint was trying to kill him because at the time he'd be fully bad. By the time the Forgotten would try to cleanse him, he would have been exposed to the corrupting magics from the other dragons.
---
&gt;I think people had the expectation to get this mount on a silver plate
---
"On a silver plate" = free. I doubt ANYONE expected to get it for free. There's a huge range between free and "jump through endless hoops and time gates all hidden so no planning is possible".
---
Griffon, does it take long to get? I did the skyscale initial collections, And realized that due to story  requirements I won’t be able to get skyscale in a long time, bah.
---
You can also just use the Bond of Faith mastery, although your method is probably cleaner.
---
Maybe I have only third of your time and tenth of legendaries but i had similar thoughts at the beginning.  
---
My attitude toward game changed, and I started to enjoy PoF. I chilled about getting new stuff, and it finally clicked. Yet I agree that PoF have much much lower replayability.
---
While it happens, op complained that people spoil any story, period.
---
He is a new player "I know many of you have been playing for many years but some of us are progressing through the story for the first time! Thank you!", it is enforced to the best of the mods extent as lordkrall mentioned. Just wanted to notify OP that there is a rule about it and the spoilers he cares for are most likely not considered spoilers on this sub anymore, thus he should be careful with reading if it he truly cares about spoilers.
---
&gt;if you're intending on crafting diviner's gear, eh
---
Hence my alternative action ... get Legendary Armor xD
---
This seems suspicious - how do people unlock the collection if they buy the food? I wonder if just putting the food in your bank and then taking it back out will unlock.
---
For the most part, yes. The reason being the biggest pro of being a power dps build is you have spikes and dips in damage. Power Revenant doesn't have spikes, so it shares more in common with Condi builds but with the negative of "When you do mechanics, your damage stops instead of just going down." That con is negated with support since you bring oh-so-important Alacrity
---
Wait.. so there is "nuff trolls" in the map, so you want to give people an even worse way for people to troll? How does that make sense at all?
---
It would give the trolls more power too... Everyone can have a tag after all.
---
But how do you have a skyscale?
---
If you like what you saw so far I suggest you get both expansions. I also suggest to just briefly start playing them so you can unlock the first level of glider and first mount. It changes gameplay by 180°. You get around much more conveniently, exploration is more fun, you can play with the environment by reaching new locations and so on and so forth.
---
There will very likely be no bigger discount within the next years, so you won't waste money. Also the new maps feature new looks, which should be something you like as an explorer.
---
That's not true. I defended north and east as well. All of them have building as well as defending events.
---
I have not stated "for no reason" - blunt trolling, low dps, afk... all these are reasons for me kick from our raid.
---
I have (and earn) enough gold that I could not think about waypoints at all,  but I usually port to the closest point I can. Eg. Lake Doric for Divinity's Reach or my Elon pass for the PoF maps... probably not worth the time it takes to load 2 screens, but I guess I'm stingy :)
---
News flash: open world =\= raids. Kicking people in open world content cos they’re not paying how you want them to play is as toxic and people trolling open world events.
---
Even Logan Thackery said it at the end... That there is unbalance magic
---
Are the GW2 Heroic Edition CD keys from the Yogscast bundle still valid? I'm looking to get some for my friends.
---
I mean, it's totally possible to talk about the story without spoilers in the titles itself. I'm now "up-to-date" myself but I'll be keeping spoilers out of the post titles even after the 28 days out of common courtesy.
---
New and returning players are visiting the sub every day to ask questions so I don't think it's too much to ask to consider them as well.
---
all bridges have an initial build event, but I've never seen a defend event on north/east, and in other threads people are saying the same thing - only s/w has defense events. are you sure you're not misremembering?
---
it's raining cats and-- wait, no, just cats
---
According to the 20 posts from the last 2 days for the exact same question, yes you can get keys from map completion again
---
He did first we were preventing Jormag/ Primordus from waking up then out of no where they implement Balthazar and how he uses a Lyssa's mirror (never explained how he got it from Lyssa)... to use it to get out of the Mist after tricking Rytlock.
---
I honestly have never thought about the cost of waypointing. It's miniscule. Just doing your dailies for the 2g will pay for dozens of teleports.
---
We don't have, abilities are known from Dev stream
---
Nah bro , just started 6 years ago.
---
cool.
---
Well then they are a bit inconsiderate, but you know the risk when you go to a game related sub, and the rules are the rules.
---
Op just seems to not want spoilers in titles which is respectable. But core story spoilers this late on is kinda silly to be too upset over imo.
---
Since you didn't mention your PvE progress I'm gonna jump to an assumption here. My PvE goal is to unlock convenience. That means maxed gliding unlocking all mounts and their masteries. I even have Warclaw "maxed" despite not WvW much. 
---
Right now I'm doing the Skyscale collection. It's a real bitch for something that's not legendary, speaking as someone that owns multiple legendaries including Aurora and Gen2. But no doubt the wall climb would be super convenient, that's why I'm doing it. 
---
Once I've unlocked Skyscale, I'll return to working on Xiuquatl again. Tbh the progress will be slow since I'm also playing another game on the side.
---
Channeling Joko and attacking the enemy with snark.
---
GW2 is "play how you want". I do not want afk/low dps/blunt trolls on my map.
---
Why do we need extra wheat?
---
So people can play how they as they want, but only if you allow that play style? Grow up
---
Yeah, it probably is but I had nothing better to do with my numpad so I figured I might as well bind the mounts to it.
---
Please see [https://www.reddit.com/r/guildrecruitment/comments/bqflgv/eupveraidsc/](https://www.reddit.com/r/guildrecruitment/comments/bqflgv/eupveraidsc/) . I am the leader and we all share on mind.
---
*can't get them
---
But... then you would just tag up, and then no one could kick anyone, and the map would just get clustered with tags.
---
I first unlocked gliding skills from HOT then immediately did all of POF story lines to get all mounts. So if you want all the mounts, I suggest finishing. But at least follow the story until you get raptor, springer, and skinner. You’ll need those for ease of transportation on rest of maps. 
---
Since finishing POF story, I’ve used the mounts to navigate around HOT to farm and finish story line.
---
Can you give me an explaination on what do you exactly mean?
---
It is. But not everyone will. Therefore my point still stands: If spoilers is a really big deal, one shouldn't hang around on a subreddit where it can be discussed. Especially not just a few days after a story release. 
---
I would for example never hang around on /r/marvelstudios if I hadn't seen EndGame, since I know people tend to be lazy with (or not even caring about) spoiler tagging things correctly.
---
I want me a Legend of Togo. Something like...
---
#Ritualist
---
* Legendary Spirit Stance: Master Togo
---
* New weapon: Scepter.
---
* Profession mechanic: Call to the Spirit Realm. Summons and controls spirits. Spirits can be upgraded to stronger versions by channeling the same profession skill again, but when upgraded, they they will take additional upkeep. The last version is a  self-destruct spirit with a considerable payload.

---

---
* Utility 2: Rupture Soul (E:15, A:1s, R:5s) Destroys target controlled spirit or the spirit with the lowest health if none is targeted. Deals damage and blinds enemies near the spirit. 
---
* Utility 3: Flesh of my Flesh (E:5, A:2.5):  Target an area. Lose 25% of current health. Controlled Spirits are healed by that amount, and up to 3 downed allies in the targeted area are revived, then healed by 1/3 of that amount.
---
* Elite: Reclaim Essence (E:5, A:0.25, R:60s) Destroys all controlled spirits. Gain 30 energy for each spirit destroyed, and all spirit skills are recharged.
---
Because Togo is the man, the legend. He deserves becoming a revenant legend.
---
Springer still will be my main mount for uphill stuff. Skyscale is really slow.
---
&gt;!I really hope the Awakened memorial with Vigil weapons on it below deck in the epilogue isn't hers!&lt;
---
That.  Is.  Epic.
---
Alternatively, if you don’t care about getting all the mounts, the war claw mounts in WVW is much easier. Just set he reward track and follow a commander / zorg around until you have enough to collect warclaw. Pretty simple. War claw is most similar to raptor, in my opinion.

Full guide up now for the Newborn Skyscales Achievement

https://doncpauli.com/newborn-skyscales/
---
I also play a necromancer reaper, one of my favorite classes and specializations!
---
Team Griffon in.
---
Balthazar was around quite a bit before the Jormag/Primordus deal (which was putting them back to sleep, not preventing them from waking up, since they have been awake for quite many years by the time GW2 starts). 
---
The Mirror is indeed not fully explained, there are some hints that there is a future plot point there though (once again, PoF). 
---
There is however no indication whatsoever that he used the mirror to get out of the Mists. He seemed quite able to do that just by himself after he was released by Rytlock.
---
I feel...STRONG
---
&gt; You can expect [...] a light-hearted atmosphere.

hahahahahahahaha
---
What the fuck just happened
---
* Personal story completion: You get to complain about how bad Zhaitan fight is, and how worse it gets as we get better and better final boss fights on each season and expansion. Oh, and a free pact weapon.
---
* S1 completion: Tons of AP new players can't get, because you can't replay S1.
---
* S2 completion: The Mawdrew back and bloodstone gobbler.
---
* HoT Completion: Reforge Caladbolg side-story and the Caladbolg skin set.
---
* S3 completion: Legendary trinket aurora.
---
* PoF Completion: Griffon mount. 
---
* S4 completion: Skyscale mount.
---
AND GET READY FOR
---
Everyone, come!
---
"In the last instance, don't touch the branded crystals around the ley lines and in the final fight.
---
I agree, but still believe it’s tied to your cost. Some veterans leave because of lack of content, but they’ve already gone through what they wanted to do for a long time. They’ve still sunk thousands into the game for no sub fee. I would expect more content from WoW and FFXIV, but for GW2, they’re either at or above my expectations especially since they’ve gone free to play for base game along with frequent expansion sales. 
---
That’s a lot of engagement to me and never wasted since you can take a break and come back.
---
Death, Good!
---
I can't imagine why they wouldn't be. Just keep in mind that the only thing they do over the f2p version is ease the restrictions, not add any new content.
---
So my other favorite that hasn’t been mentioned yet is ranger with Druid specialization. It’s a middle armor and you still have pets for protection. I like the magically aspects of Druid. I use this character most in PVE and WVW.
---
Team griffon just showed you how to play the game.
---
Don't tell me they sent YOU to help.
---
Just to be sure, you chose Joko in your first time playing the instance (on that character) and you're playing through the story normally?
---
 *Oh* dear. *Oh*, mercy. The White Mantle is upon me. Woe! *Lamentation! Is this the end for poor Logan*? \~ Logan Thackeray 1325 AE

---
Take my land, take me where I cannot stand
---
I don't care, I'm still free, you can't take skyscale from me!
---
I have around 80g at the moment and I'm very frugile, I try not to use any waypoints, mostly only if I'm forced to because I died(although I can happily lie dead for half an hour waiting for some kind soul to revive me) 
---
The other day I ran across 4-5 maps to get to my destination, I love mounts!
---
My friends always get annoyed with me if I don't want to waypoint so there's the downside!
---
According to you how much gold do i have to start flipping items on the tp?
---
If you only have the core game you'll only get dailies in core tyria. If you purchase the expansions you start getting daily quests like desert forager. Since OP wants to do things in order he won't be able to do that set of daily quests since he would need to start the initial PoF quest to get there.
---
I can't believe you decided to play this game anyway after you were treated that way. I would have charged back anything possible and let Anet rot.
---
such ***MIGHT***
---
I'd say it's only empty right now because of the new content.  Give it a couple weeks and there will be groups active at peak times
---
Well Aurene’s mom and brother can both talk. I don’t know why this is so surprising.
---
Huh and know [dulfy.net](https://dulfy.net) is down D:

I was agreeing, replied to the wrong person. =P

Coming Tuesday: "Portals and waypoints will no longer be usable while carrying Oakhearts Essence."

There's a few achievements that give some ore: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Crystalline_Ore 
---
For the most part though, you have to spend time in Dragon Stand. You don't need the meta for them, but it does of course make it a million times easier, but every map has about 6-8 pods just sat in the wild. It's no way efficient, but it's something you can chip away at at least. 
---
I do see several DS groups on NA, I don't know what it's like on EU though. After reset it's usually pretty popular. And of course you can always wait til a DS Daily events comes up, there will be plenty of people then :)
---
You can find noxious pods even an empty DS map, there are a lot fewer of course but there are some if you run around, it's better than nothing
---
"FEEDBACK LOOP INITIA-- I FEEL SIX FEET TALL!"
---
It was way more than two lines if you follow Rox around in Chapters 5 and 6. She has a lot of dialogue discussing her views on her life and joining th olmakhan.
---
Well I had been playing since release and really wanted her to try it with me, she fell in love with the game. Absolutely loved it, it didnt take her that long to catch up on what she lost, but still, very frustrating for her.
---
Oh god that's clearly shows how a naive you're keep going man. It's all good (:. I'll have my time soon to laugh about how things can be different lawl.
---
That's why you linked cases you found linking 100% feedback ebay sellers and getting banned from buying their gift cards, right?
---
While it's rather slow, you can just go into DS and run around the Map, since there are always Nodes Up even if no Event is being done
---
(I'd guess there are up to ~8 Nodes in the Instance).
---
So every now and then when you have a bit of spare time, just go in and go through every lane, until the Hype of the new Episode dies off
---
This is an awful idea, sorry.
---
If you're from EU do what the video suggests. You may get somewhere.
---
Literally only getting Skyscale for the achievements. I hope it gets better because using the rental Skyscales on the map is really frustrating. They handle so badly
---
Something different I won't discuss about it publicly. x). Now be gone .
---
I would like a Togo themed legend, but... spirits again? We already have a spirit spammer espec with Kalla. Also Togo barely used any spirits. An ash/bundle or healing themed espec would fit more to him.
---
Riding beetles from the starting point to the three camps. 10/10
---
Yes, 100%. I've been in several multibridge squads and did defends myself as well has had people call them out. I do not know the exact circumstances which need to be fulfilled for the bridge defend event to spawn, but I definitely defended those bridges as well as the others.
---
I've only played necro since launch and it's very viable nowadays,
---
Just prove the haters otherwise by handling everything with exceptional skill.
---
I'd recommend power reaper as main powerhouse
---
I'm doing this collection right now. When the mission is done, open the item in your inventory and it will be unlocked. Same for all mission steps.
---
That's quality cabbage !
---
Nice vid mate, maybe ill grow a couple of hands and try that build. Thanks for the guide!
---
On FAQ add that you need to progress on "A star guide to us" in order to unlock suns refuge to start day 2.
---
So many over heard lines, but not one comment with “WE HAVE PROTECTED TARIR FOR OVER A CENTURY!”

Basically theres 3 parts to the map with different themes and factions (like olmakham, ghosts from mists etc). We help each part gain a stronger foothold and advancing their levels (a bit like 1st map of HoT). We do all sorts of events here to do that. Then when all bases are lvl4 we all converge to middle to attack kralk and his branded (which lorewise happens at the same time as the commander is attacking him inside the story).   
---
After this is done 9 champs spawn across the map, and you follow a train to defeat them, chests spawn at end of meta and when killing these champs and that is the map OP had made. You get the keys to open them by doing the events for the meta, also from defeating these champs so even if the train misses one you can still open the chests if you have keys.
---
Our next objectives are clear:
---
1.  Rebuild the Great Northern Wall  
---
2.  Deport all Charr back to their homelands  
---
3.  Make Ascalon Great Again!

is there's anything actually on the airship?

Guild Wars 2 Living World Season 5:  “Purple Crystal Cleanup”
---
If only he could have saved
---
himself
---
Earliest is, iirc, tuesday (or whatever day the patch released for you).
---
Day 1 for scales, sick and eggs
---
Day 2 for charging the egg
---
Day 3-6 for feeding (3 a day and 12 total)
---
Day 7 for the next step.
---
My favourite interaction was, suicide pact to rez 9 people with Dwayna's blessing, where players were dropping from buildings to rez each other,suicide 5 meters from the NPC that gave the buff.
---
Too bad that someone who will pick this collection up in the furture, will miss out on that helpful yet bizarre part of this mount rush.
---
I honestly never really used the springer that often until Dragonfall. It makes it super easy to get around there.
---
But so far it is an iconic look for Balthazar. And he has sweet fiery animations! Wouldn't you like some? To spread thick fire? Fire is good.
---

Now you're thinking with portals. And waypoints. And oakheart essence.
---
Watch your uphills and be careful when you make turns — it’s easy to turn into the Heart of the Brandstorm by accident and die.
---
But otherwise is fun!
---
I think "suspicious" is the wrong word. I meant that it doesn't seem to be wai if people can purchase the food from the TP but you have to craft it in order to unlock the collection.
---
&gt;How the heck could he class change from engineer to guardian?!
---
Actually, Canach is a Warrior, who just so happens to also be an expert on explosives and stealth.

I'm low-key wishing we could use his class someday as an elite spec. Something that sacrifices frontline brawn for a more targeted approach. Kinda like a buff agent or a hitman type class, who uses deception and stealthy attacks to lure you into a trap.
---
I would if previous elite wasn't fire themed.
---
The main reason for the double skip where just waypointing would've brought him just as far, is to avoid a loading screen.
---
By spacing the two out *just right*, he was given the ready for takeoff.
---
Troublesome Skyscale is correct. And you are also correct that no one is at this part as well.
---
I love this one (in french). I found it cute :'(
---
Moss is interesting. My first thought was like grass.. so you could have different beard types.
---
Apparantly you were desperate enough to mention it. You don't have any better person to share that with? I kinda feel bad for you now. So lonely I'm the person you have to tell.
---
Is it my fault that they are manufacturing playtime and extending it for no reason? Am I wrong to be pissed at that?
---
Start by doing the game story, if that is boring you, and you have no interest. Then start raiding and get to fractals/dungeons
---
That's what I'm doing for the bridge events.
---
underwater content was where i was going with it ..
---
NPC's and an achievement!
---
You get an achievement for speaking to either Taimi og the pirate woman on the ship.
---
But it is a short bow, it doesn't even engulf terrain with fire that much. Some of it, maybe. But greatsword. Can you imagine the blazing glory? Maybe fire and lightning combined. So much fire! This lot!
---
If you can't understand that not providing any evidence for claims you are making based on calculation directly implies that we should assume you did it correctly, then your logic is just as badly flawed as the maths you have shown to date.
---
Show your fucking working or shut the fuck up.
---
I’m speaking in pass tense (used the wrong words, sorry, but you shouldn’t think I’m dumb enough to say that especially when I’m talking to someone who does like it).
---
The in-game collection has "*This content requires all of the episodes of Living World Season 4.*" on Saving Skyscales. I've gotten players  complaining that they're still lost/confused as to what's going on so I'm trying to reduce clutter in the collection sections.
---
That is the worst idea I've ever read on this subreddit, congrats.
---
Thank you so much!
---
Clock through the meta events. LS4's metas are mostly well designed enough to keep you going for a while and you'll get a squad of 25 or so if you put it in the LFG. LS3's are fine too. Path of Fire's metas often feel too hard work for not enough loot *or* fun, but they have their devotees.
---
Sorry but I belong to Menzies team! There are dozens of us! Dozens!
---
&gt; I don't need to learn English to communicate with your toxic brain 
---
Nah, but you would want it if anyone is supposed to take you serious. Especially if you're talking that much nonsense. It gets alot easier to identify what you were trying to say if you don't need to guess the meaning of 50% of the content.
---
&gt; I can speak it a little bit that others can understand which is totally fine better than nothing kiddo xd. 
---
Yeah, better than nothing, that's true. But still bad enough that calling out others is kinda embarassing if you didn't even manage to aquire a second language.
---
Yep, API problems affecting [metabattle.com](https://metabattle.com) as well
---
Its the perfect final to cap off the post hot story
---
Heart of Thorns is unfortunately a prime example of GW2's really bizarre difficulty ramp. There is absolutely nothing prior to it that prepares you for the difficulty jump and it is a massive one.
---
Emojis, "lawwl", "pussy". Yeah, you definitly seem like a grown up adult.
---
Whoever made the bet is an idiot.
---
We lose to Kralkatorrik: everyone ded, can't even collect $$ let alone use it.
---
We win: everyone lives, he has to pay a fortune to Canach.
---
At least with Balthazar, some people believed he was still a decent guy if they had not run into him.
---
# Did I mention how much I hate Skritt?
---
my pleasure, big thx for your feedback &lt;3
---
thx nici :)
---
Man wvw is far from dead so I would try to find a small guild to roam with or just have fun and try some new builds
---
&gt;!With the end of the story talking that Dragons have thought and emotion but are corrupted by too much or multiple types of magic,!&lt; I still hope that if Steve awakes and we go to Cantha, I hope we "cleanse" the water dragon. There's a section of PoF that talks about the Forgotten (i think) attempting a ritual to cleanse Kralk but failed. I'd love to see some form of a cleanse verse another kill.

Some people treat spoilers much to serious considering how predictable every cliffhanger is.

oh no he's hot
---
&gt;Griffon is really quite a nightmare to complete without a large number of friends available to port in at a moments notice.
---
That is... not true at all lol, stop misleading the poor guy. The only pain is the one (1) legendary bounty, and commanders still run that for people who need the griffon. Needing "a large number of friends to port in at a moment's notice' isn't even gross hyperbole-- it's just false.
---
Oh?! Can you elaborate anymore on what the collections entail? If we have to buy anything from the TP, I’d like to get a jump on it before prices skyrocket.
---
That does not solve the problem since the cooldown is basically a "booster". It only ticks down for the character you are currently playing regardless of where the item is.
---
No
---
Wait, doesn't this make the item more valuable? 
---
So now instead of having to wait an hour across your entire account to use the item again, you just have to wait on a specific character, and can use it again instantly for how ever many additional characters you have.
---
I loved it. I did know what to do, whats going on and how i am going to survive. But you will get the hang of it and you will get better at fighting and navigating. Enjoy the journey, just go with it
---
Thanks :)
---
around one year before that famous banwave
---
Pretty much what I thought.  I see these Zerker Quickbrands recommended often, but I feel like in pugs it's best to get some Diviner Trinkets since you can't always depend on pugs to be reliable.
---
In a way, sure. But if you only play one character it really blows.
---
She's in the instrance where we mourn aurene
---
Where does one look up PvE builds nowadays? I used to look things up on the Snowcrows website, but it hasn't been loading properly for me, for a while now.
---
If you can spare the 10-15 minutes, do dailies for the 2 gold, after two months of saving, you should have enough.
---
I disagree. The deep sea dragon is suggested - by placement of where krait, karka, and quaggan make landfall - to be more west than south. I'd imagine Mordremoth - or Primordus on the Ring of Fires - was far closer than where Kralkatorrik fell.
---
What are the water precursors?
---
first off give this a listen to set the mood, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9D2mvoMKLE .
---
Next up take a look are you classes ways to block/ignore dmg pick up a couple of those, at least one stun break and one lowish cd condi cleanse. For the rest of it kill things before they kill you. You can side step alot of aoe attacks, jump over the snipers line shot thing, red aoes are bad. Pay attention to the mobs you are fighting, mordrem snipers are high dps but squishy af, the coztic shadow leaper guys are deadly af and retreat often avoid the aoes and close the gap so you can burst them down. Pocket raptors aggro you then wait a second and then charge, you can dodge at that time and avoid several first hits, also just dropping all the aoe to cleave them down helps alot. Also things like protection, blind, weakness and all forms of cc (stun, daze, knockdown/back etc) help alot.
---
Central tyria everything attacks so slow and does such minor dmg per hit its a cakewalk. HoT is the opposite of that, things attack at almost the same speed as you and deal threatening dmg on their own. Pay more attention to the what the mob is doing (and whats in range to aggro) than watching your characters pretty animations. This is a learning curve you will die and thats okay, once you figure things out your deaths will be further and further apart.
---
Urge to kill, rising!
---
Various guilds will consistently organize full HoT meta runs (td&gt; ab &gt; ds &gt; ab). Might not right now because of new map but it’ll start up again
---
Only 6-7, versus 40-50+ in a meta run
---
Conspiracy; ANet added timegates in the hopes to fix these typos and errors before everyone saw them.
---
Please yes! As I play I would like to age my male Sylvari from that twiggy goatee to a full-on Spanish Moss beard. Lol, from little acorns and all that.
---
Have you ever seen a serious ad with a person in it that doesn't wear makeup?
---
And she's on the map, but there's nothing about her in the missions or epilogue.
---
rage, venom and carcharias
---
And some flowers, of course 🌸
---
It should be available with the upcoming reset. I'll be browsing Reddit to see if there are any items to buy before they get gouged.
---
I have never heard of you church. It must be a church small with small candles and little stained glasses. Our church is big, it has bigger candles and big wall sized stained glasses. It sees better than those in smaller glasses. great eyesight. Potency!
---
Does the Mists that we explored in this season have any connection to the PvP related Mists areas or is PvP just not part of the lore in any way?
---
I hear you, but if you only play one character then the fact that you have to be logged on that character for the cool down, shouldn't really affect you much.
---
&gt; I mean low-ranking Branded, humans and earth elementals alike, seem to be quite a bit more intelligent, active and determined than non-corrupted elementals.
---
Because they're part of a hive mind with Kralkatorrik... Elementals and anomalies are not.
---
&gt; What about Glint?
---
Glint was Kralkatorrik's child before she was a minion; so like sylvari, she's unique, but in a different way. She wasn't created out of corrupted elements like destroyers or The Shatterer.
---
&gt; What is your definition?
---
Biological reproduction. I do not consider self cloning or creating constructs in one's own image to be a form of reproduction in this sense. That's more replication than reproduction in my mind.
---
On top of that, reproduction results in a similar (but non-identical) creature, whereas dragon corruption creating minions from elements would be capable of making any form. The Wrathbringer is the perfect example of this - it is created in the same manner as The Shatterer, yet one is draconic like Kralkatorrik, and the other is more akin to a bristleback. The Destroyer Queen from the skritt storyline, similarly, created destroyer trolls and destroyer harpies from its "eggs".
---
I see it the opposite way.
---
We lose to Kralkatorrik: Bet outcome not important.
---
We win: Against all odds, he gave additional motivation to one of the Commander’s closest supporters. With death near certain, this is perhaps the only worthwhile place to utilise these funds.
---
And here I was thinking *I* was smart using the fire tunnels.
---
I imagine it would be every single one we can earn as a player. The story is more and more referring to us as the commander when we are out adventuring meaning (to me at least) anything my character (or any) has done means the commander has done that also.
---
My character has a beard of thorns
---
Shubbery
---
If you're doing the treats part, go on chrono use improved alacrity trait and spam some alacrity on you when throwing them. u can throw extra treats cause the skill doesnt disapear fast disapear before it's off cooldown.
---
just found this, dont know how many u can throw cus i stopped after i threw one extra to look if it pinged the achief. 
---
But i saw the skill off cooldown before it was gone again so might be able to skip the whole time gate, dont know. 
---
will update tomorrow
---
You want to put broccoli on the talking cabbages?
---
*Did you mean: Beast Boy*

Okay, I'm just happy to hear i dont really suck as hard at this game as it feels right now

Yes i know that, but this chapter they throw you in the face 2words after flying a dragon, totally untimed and unrelatable to anything in the near time and again, rushed on the first 10mins.
---
I always wanted a charr character but because of this reason I have skipped it considering I spend a lot of time riding mounts.

I think Anet should apply special rule to charr height scaling.
---
If you kill off the duke i will be slightly upset then forget in a few hours.

There's around 80 total pods you can loot on a completed DS, just fyi.
---
So I got locked out of my account due to 2-factor authentication (changed phones and now changed internet). I've made a support ticket, but it seems I'll be missing the PoF sale :( 
---
Does anyone know if I can buy PoF from the GW2 site and then apply the game code to my account? Or if I use a new account to buy it, it's tied to that forever? If not, anyone got any tips for getting past 2FA?
---
Whatever you're looking for, it's on the ground, just run around.
---
Huh. I knew it’s around 100 ore total, didn’t remember how many pods. Haven’t done it in a few months, been taking a break from the game
---
He thinks he's in FFXIV clearly.
---
I can’t the wind pushes me away not letting me through🤔
---
Just to verify, the expansions are on sale ending today, correct? Does anyone have an official link? I can't find one I'd like to stick it in a Discord.
---
Make f2p account, buy expansion (or both) and make sure you don't apply it to that account. You'll receive a code which you can use on your main account when support contacts you back.
---
You're not supposed to go through.
---
you have to interact with a stone formation close to the sand
---
That description is adorable!  ❤
---
I only did one ascended armor set before my first legendary, and have hardly crafted ascended gear since, I just get it from drops and other rewards
---
Shot through the heart and you're to blame! 
---
Darling, you give Germans a bad name!
---
interesting. I'm already done with the achievement bit I'll keep an eye open, since this doesn't seem like most of the people here know about and the wiki doesn't have any info yet either.
---
😂
---
Are these needed achievements for griffon or skyscale account wide or character locked?
---
I have all maps open,  but only about 10% story done among different characters.
---
Neither does the trading post NPC! The bliss!
---
Greats word with weapon skills focusing on melee, cleave, and physical dps.
---
The legend/utility skills should focus on something revenant does not have yet, but I am not sure exactly what. There are lots of options.
---
That one is probably okay or overlooked by most people because it signals loot time is on it's way
---
I was thinking about that. You wouldn't be able to trim or cut a leaf beard, because the leaves would no longer have a natural shape, being cut off at the bottom. With a grass beard, you wouldn't have this problem.
---
You can start doing some high volume low cost flipping when you have a few hundreds (or even earlier), while you keep farming. You place some orders, go farm, relist them when you're done. When those hundreds start turning into thousands, there will a moment when your time will be better spent in front of a TP NPC. Flipping is % based, if you move 1000g and get a 2% ROI in an hour, you're getting 20g/h. Same amount per hour if you get a 4% ROI off 500g. So it's a bit complicated to give a straight answer, as that depends on what gold are you able to keep in movement and how fast are you getting the flips done.
---
Agreed, though they are so condescending as well, which stops me from really liking them as a race.
---
Yeah, that's how I got up there.  In fact I use the fire tunnels+griffon to get to all the high places on the map.
---
Same, a beard makes the appearance  more mature and after all the shit the commander has been through, I'd totally imagine him a litte bit worn down and rough.
---
Oh WOW that is beautiful!!!
---
Love your character too!
---
The other day I got to hear the full version in Black Citadel:
---
- You break it, you bought it.
---
- Joke's on you, I don't have any money.
---
- Okay. You break it, I break you.
---
I would assume that the "Mother" Part is the first Breadcrumb for the next LS Season Story. We have dealt with all Dragons so far beside Steven/Bubbles.
---
The music just makes me think "What. A. Beautiful... DUWANG!"
---
I ended up just going to Bloodstone Fen and mining more-I get a chance at rubies as well.
---
If you just need someone to listen and type, dictation is kinda my thing. Lemme know if I can help you.
---
Mix it up, and play other races/genders too? :D I love the sylvari lines.
---
"We have to go back to the island!"
---
Yup the egg collection
---
This makes me sad. If we had known and cleansed Zhaitan and Mordremoth  (assuming they were acting evil because of magic corruption) we could have avoided killing them.
---
That one is the single most annoying, as it repeats like every 3 seconds. The Camp Resolve ones are only more annoying because there's so many of the frequently repeating ones D:
---
Kralk hopes his granddaughter would never have to kill what she loved... Could it mean Kralk had to kill his mother?
---
Oh, hallo bill9 :D
---
The mount movement in the new map is unironically my favorite part of it: Cruising down the excellently-designed roads at near-top speed on a beetle. Lunging crevasses on Raptor. Rabbit bouncing up cliffs. Jackal portals in useful places for gaining altitude, then diving off that altitude in a griffon to fighter-jet around the map (especially fun in the Melandru zone, where there are lots of neat-but-not-too-close obstacles that make you feel like an ace).
---
It's an overall fabulously designed map that never feels like a chore to get around.
---
&gt; Statistically speaking, this is rather rare!
---
ftfy
---
Is that my dark angry lost brother?
---
Yeah, the three main pats seem designed to be easily traveled with the beetle mount. Stuff like this makes the map very fun to play
---
??? I didn't call you out about language  what???
---
:D
---
I can type lawl, xd and pussy deal with it.
---
Open up a guild, name it something along the line of gift/present or a nickname of hers and get people to join. On her birthday invite her to the guild, gather up all members at one place and take her to that place. I think it would be really cool for her to see that a bunch of people gathered for her birthday and cheer and dance for/with her on that day
---
I haven't really bothered. I found the skyscale underwhelming and the controls annoying, tbh.
---
That is such an unsmooth change to the event D:
---
Can just use position rewinder!
---
It's too hard for me to make a decent looking man. So I prefer charr females. The human mesmer is my bf's character.
---
that reminds me of the guy in Salma District:
---
&gt; I could uuuuse one of those!
---
and
---
&gt; Shut up now! I can't hear anything!
---
Canach is the new scourge of elona
---
I finally broke down and hot keyed my rabbit, dog and birdcat. I really didn't want even more buttons to hit, but constantly changing mounts with the mouse was far more brutal...
---
Agreed. He could have gotten his point across without going there
---
That's what I did. I already got 25/25 xD
---
More, Here!
---
I see someone doesn't have griffon yet or they are about to learn even more
---
I only play without sound when I just quickly log in to grab the daily chest from Tarir, and even then it feels so wrong not to hear what's going on. My mind goes as far as to mentally produce the sounds it expects to hear - from the leaps of raptor and the opening of the grand chest to the ambient shimmering :D
---
But it's not?
---
These are just game screenshots with a filter applied to them, no?
---
So if you use a brush on your hair, do sylvari use an underbrush for their beards?
---
Wow! Thats a great suggestion. Thank you
---
Welcome back agent, it has been a while! Did you remember to bring the apple cider?

Cant say enough how much I love this map. Seriously. Havent felt this happy with a new map since LS3

I think betting in favor of the player character probably falls under Tyrian Unethical Life Pro Tips.  And yes, there is a subreddit for that.

How can I hide my story quests marker?
---
Orr was sunk in a wave of spunk...
---
I just tried it, original taco files + your all in one zipped + reactif zipped and I'm getting the default diamonds everywhere.
---
It is one of the frames during the pet animation. You actually are bent down during it, but I angled my character on the nest so that it would be face to face to the skyscale during it. And I eventually got it by spamming printscreen.
---
It's time to install the radial mount menu! It's awesome!
---
It can!  I have the same key set for Swim Down, Look Behind, and Mount Ability 2.  They don't overwrite each other, so underwater it swims down, on foot it looks behind, and on a mount it uses ability 2.  No issues, and really saves keys for other things.
---
Try it just with my pack, other zipped packs may cause problems. If you wanna use them both, you have to unzip them and copy Data folder to both POIs folder as well as into Data in root folder
---
Lol, that's what I thought too, but so far I haven't gotten them mixed up.
---
Broccoli
---
Let the stupid whiny kids complain and stop playing, they wouldn't stick around long anyways! :s
---
The holy trinity in GW2 isn't really that strong, and basically doesn't exist outside of raids. Even in dungeons (and fractals, which are a kind of dungeon you'll see a lot), 4 DPS and 1 support (or just 5 DSP) is the norm
---
For 95% of the content, you want a DPS focus. The combat style is very different from WoW and similar games; you usually can't facetank. It's usually more dependent of avoiding damage and there are *very* few taunt skills.
---
If you like being in the centre of combat and melee characters, guardian might be good for you as they are pretty strong all round and have good self-defence skills.
---
If you just want, like, a million billion hitpoints, go necro. They're tanky, but don't do a tank role. 
---
Races are mostly cosmetic and lore differences. They do have some different skills, but these are fairly slight. 
---
If you want a character that will almost always get a place in a party, go for a support spec. Mesmer, guardian, revenant and ranger all have in-demand support roles and mesmers often tank in raids.
---
I envy your luck :) I contacted customer support, I hope it does not take forever for them to answer :(
---
what hinders to try? slow download speed? you may hear many terrible things about pvp; but you should definitely try it.
---
Can I get a Davy Jones beard made of roots or vines?
---
Okay thanks, yeah I was reading up on stuff. People say warrior is the easiest class. But I kinda want to play a range character, what would be a good range char?
---
just saying better than 0
---
did you check if you can remove that debuff by going to pvp match etc?
---
I feel like it's mainly a result of people complaining about how faceroll easy the core game is. They made HoT as hard as it is as a response to that and then the more casual crowd got steamrolled. I think Pof was a nice middle ground difficulty wise.
---
I’m thinking guardian. How is gameplay with guardian? Is it too slow?, like will I be killing mobs too slow?
---
Canach is the new owner of Caudecus' Manor confirmed.
---
Also, he kept all the portraits of Logan up just to mess with him.
---
Hit bond of faith while glitching against a map barrier like that.
---
I dare you. I know what happens.
---
Necromancer is a solid choice for a lot of situations. Scourge is a versatile spec and has solid options for all game modes. Besides that; Guardian, Ranger, and Engineer (in no particular order) all have great options for both damage and support builds.
---
I do tend to like support/healer classes, so I tend to lean toward professions that can fill that role. Every class has good options though. I'd suggest checking out Metabattle and reading up on builds that sound interesting.  [https://metabattle.com/wiki/Raid](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Raid)
---
Nice so i can pass on it thx &lt;3
---
What alternatives are there to metabattle?
---
It might :/ they might be a bit bogged down with tickets because new patch.
---
i even read it in his voice..
---
PvP is fairly mechanical and tactical skill based and doesn't need gear, whereas WvW does. GW2 does have a fairly unique gameplay and everything in your build counts.  Most of time you even have room to make small edits in builds to suit your needs, like for a certain playstyle or against a certain matchup. 
---
Balance is sometimes a bit whacky, but in general there is a somewhat fair balance wherein you can practically play every class and they all have at least two very viable builds. You do kinda need the expansions for that since a core class is generally less viable, although there are quite a few core builds that are fairly viable.
---
The pvp scene however is pretty damn cynical and where you'd find an "amazing community" pretty much anywhere else in the game, this is by far not the case in pvp ranked matches. Outside of those people are generally helpful though, even if it is to boast their expertise.
---
Yep, don't do it. That was my decision and I'm not even bothered now.
---
Hehe, yah. Each zone adds another NPC, starting with just one in Verdant Brink.
---
All these people here going "bUt iTs gRiFfOn uP"
---
bruh, yall don't use the S key to go up?? Feels WAY better.
---
Ranger comes to mind first. Mesmer and elementalist both have ranged builds but are both among the more difficult classes. I believe warrior has ranged capabilities too but not very familiar with the heavy classes.
---
I just learned more!  I always just used the "walk backwards" key to climb upwards on my griffon.  I didn't know the mount action 2 worked, also!  Thanks!
---
Entering Super Adventure Box might work! ;p
---
What do you mean "at least"? Account wide would have been better because the timer would run down regardless of which char you play
---
I think we should consider changing that policy, as a community. Because there are now major things that can be spoiled, having spoiler tags across all story stuff with a [SPOILERS S4E3] type tag might be a good idea and only a minor inconvenience for posters.
---
Nah I can't really recreate it on my own, it just happens every so often if I leave the game up too long. But then the client crashes when I try to log out anyway. Computer failing me probably.
---
Hell yeah, comming and helping people is rewarding AF!
---
Have you tried to come to the nest again? I believe I had something similar and just left nest and went into it again and somehow this treat appeared again.
---
TITANS
---
Thanks. Will do. You guys are already that helpful! I think ima love the community!
---
I think Canach has some kind of thorn moustache and on the chin...
---
i gotta say, every game has a salty pvp just because it’s pvp. I think noone should expect it to be not salty. i mean, i haven’t seen a not salty pvp in mmorpg yet
---
&gt; but if you do pick them up manually, you only get 3 at a time, remember you can pick up more, as it'll increase your charges.
---
theres a couple of other instant pick up 10s, like south of main camp spawn before the bridge
---
Explain please, or link.
---
Descretize.eu for Fractals. 
---
Snowcrows for Raids.
---
WvW/PvP... you can try asking on Reddit.
---
Open World... You're sol and will have to figure it out yourself.
---
I would say that its actually a pretty small difficulty increase from Living Story 2 - if any. But with that season being locked behind the gem store many new players don't play through it before jumping into the expansion. I wish there was more to guide new players to that season, if solely because it doesn't bridge that difficulty leap.
---
I'd say the community is slightly more friendly, on average, than the average MMO. Raids can get a bit salty and you get temper tantrums in ranked PvP, but it's pretty chilled out.
---
I have tried that a bazillion times, but all it does for me is slow me to a halt.
---
You are not my leader.
---
yeah, tested the other shrines earlier and those had them as well. 
---
I think each of the exits from the main camp has an ember bucket (maybe only after a certain stage though, like after a dolyak escort event or something), but no spears as far as I can tell. there might be more buckets near the waypoints as well, haven't checked yet.
---
best we have now is twig goatees
---
I guess no since guides are already up
---
Condi soulbeast is perfectly fine! Used to be absolutely most meta before power (finally!) muscled its way in.
---
Play it if you like. I'm just glad I can finally play power ranger.
---
&gt; Is that confirmed anywhere? I thought it was ED Kralk-&gt;Glint minion/champion-&gt;Ritual-&gt;Glaust-&gt;Glint
---
Repeatedly, yes. It's the entire premise of why Aurene calls Kralkatorrik "grandfather". The entire premise of why Balthazar wanted Vlast and then Aurene during Path of Fire. Because they're literally of his bloodline.
---
&gt; See here, most notably Parthenogenesis occurs in some lizards and birds meaning there is a real-life precedent for Kralk producing "biological" offspring without a mate. And we definitely haven't seen any mates in any of the dragons or Mordy's spawn.
---
I'm not saying that the Elder Dragons need a mate. I'm saying that The Shatterer is not considered a scion of an Elder Dragon. Not sure what "Mordy's spawn" have to do with anything given no such thing is (proven) to exist.
---
There is a **vast** difference between a scion and a minion.
---
&gt; In order to form a viable "species" the crucial point here is self replication which if we're being honest Kralk was not capable of and Glint's line is debatable, most likely extinct anyway by now because I doubt we'll ever see Aurene produce offspring of her own. I don't recall any other dragon minions being capable of such, the closest would probably be Corrupted Ice Elementals summoning lesser versions of themselves but we have no confirmation of those growing to full size and ability if not kamikazeed into us players.
---
Now I'm completely confused what you're trying to say.
---
&gt; If the Destroyer Crabs spawned by the Queen were able to grow into Queens themselves they would constitute a proper species in my eyes. All other cases seem to be non-cyclical and thus non-reproductive in the narrower sense but this definition also excludes RL worker bees/ants (except for those freak cases where they morph into a new queen if the old one dies...)
---
Dragon minions do not mature. They may increase in size and power when given enough magic (see asura chapter 3 storyline), but the fact that the Destroyer Queen was creating destroyer trolls and harpies alongside crabs and crablings (yes, not just destroyer crablings but also full sized destroyer crabs) rather shows that it is no traditional reproduction of any sort.
---
By your definition, then the fact that The Shatterer can create Branded Earth Elementals is full on proof that it is a species. But to me, that's not the case. It's just like an elementalist summoning various elementals or an asura creating golems.
---
Dragon minions are closer to Gepetto and Pinnochio than an actual parent-children situations. And this true for **all** dragon minions. A sylvari will never have a child, and similarly, a destroyer will never have a child. They are not a species.
---
But Elder Dragons can have children, and their children can have children. As proven by the very existence of Glint, Vlast, and Aurene. Whom are the only scions known to us.
---
Not enough speed then?
---
I imagine the beard would stay whatever shape the sylvari wanted without needing trimmed like their hair does.
---
A few years ago I commanded teq a few times a week. I got 3 tips over the 6 months I did it regularly, but I got a handful of thank you whispers and mails too.
---
Sounds like MMOs aren't your genre, friendo. Uninstall. End your suffering and be free.
---
The new rechargable teleport to friend seems like a good pick; then she can come hang out with you wherever you are in Tyria.
---
the "beards" sylvari have in game are part of the face, unfortunately
---
Bringing back the HoT masteries is what I like the most about this map. Shrooms, Tubes, Ley Gliding.
---
i changed maps and appeared in the purple smoke and died, thanks map change....
---
It's how the game was always intended to be played. Heck, even easier than it was back in beta. The mobs used to always run out of your AOEs, kite you around trying to backstab you and avoid your skillshots, and used CC. The difficulty was literally gutted by 95-99% between open beta and release because people QQd a lot. It was further nerfed in regards to Orrian mobs in the months following release.   
---
Of course the HOT mobs that are actually a little challenging were a rude awakening for many, after the terminally easy base game.
---
He uses thief pistol skills pre-HoT
---
Probably not since it's a bundle and you already need to carry the Oakheart Essence (same would go for using a White Mantle/Watchwork portal).
---
You didn't show us anything. You said you measure speed from the video, you did not at any point say where in the video or what you were comparing the tail to.
---
You're fully aware of what I'm asking, and you're now at the point of wilful blindness.
---
Show your working, or shut the fuck up.
---
No, he was always a warrior/thief hybrid until HoT, nothing to do with revenant
---
He was sword/pistol using warrior sword skills, thief pistol skills, and the thief dual skill Pistol Whip.
---
r/woosh
---
Been playing MMO's for close to 20 years. They're usually a good time-sink and I have tons of time on my hands. 
---
Recently though, it's become nothing buy Skinner and RNG loot boxes, daily log in "rewards" and developer concepts about "replayable content" that just isn't interesting enough to play over again.
---
If I could find something better for my time sink? I would be there.
---
What are you trying to reach in terms of FPS? You're not likely to attain 144fps. I don't understand why you're complaining when you can run it 80fps and full HD.
---
I do this as well. I hate having to juggle between all the characters. So over time I just throw more and more gear at the alts. However, I do want to eventually have 9 legend sets of armor on the 9 base classes of the characters I play the most. What would I do then? Probably work on weapons, while throwing more gear at alts. Eventually I'll hit a wall, but that wall is so far away.
---
&gt; Edit: not that I'm defending this artist. Their design sense is absolutely awful imo
---
Not only the design itself is horrible, but the execution is crap. See all the white he left around the gw2 logo ...
---
Sounds similar to my experience. I occasionally get one or two for portals as a mesmer, but that's really, really rare. Are you NA or EU, out of interest?
---
I just feel that a 15% BD Quickbrand is mismatched with players that aren't already running T4's or CMs, y'feel me?  If you're doing like SC/dT level DPS then you don't need boon duration or you could forego it all-together and stagger FMW!  It's just that that isn't exactly good contextual advice because it's an unrealistic standard that 99% of the people it's given to won't meet.
---
thanks i looked yesterday and didn’t see anything. i just did that. thank you!
---
Name it after the Canach outfit.
---
*Executioner*!
---
you can buy her some cool looking weapon skin for her character
---
sad but true
---
It's a valid concern, I would say that you should take it up with the moderators of the sub.
---
REALLY?! Now I gotta get back up there....
---
And on the other side of the coin there's people like me, who cannot stop appreciating the voice acting on some of the fractals, even after hearing it 30-ish times. Such as pretty much the entirety of the nightmare fractal.
---
All you need to maintain quickness with this kind of boon duration is that your renegade presses f4 off cooldown when the group is together, so if you have a renegade I don't think its unreasonable. If you're in totally alacrity-less groups than some diviner gear would be useful, but if I was making one set of gear while I levelled up in fractals I'd rather make the gear that will be more useful to me in T4s when I get there.
---
Or maybe I'm overestimating the quality of the average renegade player.
---
I would love to see this or barky beards or even some that look grassy.
---
I'd take account wide or a gizmo with a skill that has a CD over this implementation.  It's only useful on characters that you play because you have to let the debuff run out.
---
So thats why maps reaching the final phases of the meta suddenly go extinct and you get the volunteer to swap maps window?
---
Ugh.
---
How am i supposed to blow my keys on chests if there are not enough events that spawn chests, like the boss rush after hitting Kralk's weakpoints :|
---
I fondly call it *The Kitchen Sink*, cuz its all in there! :D
---
Dishonor &amp; White Mantle Portal Device to name two.
---
IMO this item still has value, it's just not nearly as valuable as I thought it would be when I imagined it being an account-wide CD rather than putting a buff on the character that needs to tick down.
---
I.. I think the debuff will have worn off naturally before then.
---
That's why lfg exists, there's always people who want to do meta.
---
There is no issue. S is for breaking. In different ways. You break to drift. You break to go down. You break to pull griffon up to stop the speed boost.
---
It would have to be a gizmo that granted you skills in order for that to work.
---
Try special forces training area and then your special action key it works with xera portal
---
The problem is that apparently now, when a map get flagged to be closed, you can't join it anymore with join server
---
If you don't get it, I'd be glad to help as well. Wouldn't take too long for a 6 min video.
---
No, Logan did not say that. You can't just make things up, attribute them to a character, and expect anyone to take you seriously.
---
What Logan said was, "But the balance of magic..." The fact that Logan doesn't understand the balance of magic shouldn't be a surprise to anyone.
---
Who voluntarily picks sylvari anyway ?
---
In other words, it isn't funny.
---
&gt; Show your working, or shut up.
---
[Here you go](https://giphy.com/gifs/fuck-you-middle-finger-ryan-stiles-x1kS7NRIcIigU). It's everything you need to know.
---
Humor is subjective. Stop being a dick and questioning my memes, just look at it and be on your way.
---
I do, obviously :D
---
For the human models it is.
---
or because in Avengers Thanos has 4 henchmen we see in Infinity War mainly and one is called Ebony Maw
---
Hard? Hardly.  
---
It's just tedious with next to 0 challenge.   
---
Griffon isn't hard to get either.
---
Honestly though if it's low tier dropping quickness isn't that big a deal and I'd rather pugs get geared easily and work to improve rather than waste time and effort on gear they'll be swapping off of. Of course you can always modify a build like this to have more or less boon duration but FB gives out so much that it's not needed. I'd rather suggest that people just pick up some boon duration [food](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Soul_Pastry)/utility if they are having issues with it while learning.
---
&gt;Atoms do not store memories
---
Actually, i've watched a video yesterday that claimed that they do. If we had technology, we could read their previous bonds and try to recreate them. I have to find that vid..
---
..i think it was Kurzgesagt about black holes tho
---
Won't go to the effort of showing evidence, but you'll go to the effort of getting a reaction gif. Wouldn't expect anything less from someone as childish as you.
---
Show your working or shut up.
---
&gt; I wouldn't care about it. It's not their business to know what I do :). 
---
Common problem with stupid people, even if enough people tell them they're stupid, they're still too stupid to realise they really are stupid.
---
&gt; Also no poor man excuse it's just childish from you to keep pressing on an old past that no one asked for :D. 
---
Old past? How is you today still being unable to use proper english or understanding % the past?
---
&gt; why you would do what? 
---
Go to your comment, use the remaining braincells and try to connect my answer with the quote it was posted below.
---
&gt; ??? bringing group down what ??? you meant the only twice when i on  Soulless Horror cause I was messaging your insane whisper. 4.1 one was  downstate 4.2 one was when I wasn't focused on the incoming wall, which I  do admit was my fault for being unfocused. 
---
So you die twice on SH in a normal w5 clear and consider it good? Also you seem to fall for the common trash player mistake. Just because you are alive, doesn't mean you're useful. You got enough ingame footage of yourself proving you have no clue what you're supposed to do on your main class warrior. Out of curiosity, with the new berserker overhaul, do you manage to get more than 4 burstskills into the berserker rotation now?
---
&gt; Just FYI:  I've killed her this week with different group, don't worry about that. 
---
I'm well aware you're able to find groups letting you leech boss kills. Is that supposed to make you special?
---
I like that stuff is all tied together...though raptor is still a pretty meh mount seeing that jackal can do everything raptor can, and more.
---
lol dude the point is that people on Ebay is not 100% safe. You can argue your self blue over this, but it wont change anything. Ebay is not 100% safe compared to official retailers or straight off from Arena Net. And with that i am done here.
---
How? They don't look anything like characters from asian MMOs.
---
Beards and mustaches made of grass, lichen, or moss would actually be pretty cool and very fitting for the male Sylvari.
---
Yes!
---
One guy suggesting it doesn't have weight, but discussing it and bringing it as an idea in more people's minds can slowly change the culture from downvoting people asking for tagged spoilers into a culture in support of unerversal spoiler tags. The policy would likely have to follow the cultural change so the mods don't have to fight culture with rules.
---
Also, pretty much everyone was sure the world would end.
---
Go read a book, try a different genre of games, or perhaps even do something that's actually productive. Why force yourself to play a game you don't enjoy? Seriously, it makes no sense whatsoever.
---
His best quality? His wiggles
---
Yeah, yeah, you are right. 
---
[Here is what you need](https://tenor.com/view/shut-up-stfu-rhoa-real-housewives-of-atlanta-gif-5219900). But now it's for real. ;)
---
Sylvari don’t need beards! They already accept same-sex love. ;)
---
Make her some dragon-shaped cookies. Grandmas love dragon-shaped cookies.
---
In case you still have this question, most classes can equip two sets of weapons at once, and have a button with a bit of a cooldown to swap between them any time. This isn't immediately obvious upon starting the game since you can't actually do it until Lv. 10. Anyways, this means that you can usually run both a melee and ranged weapon on your character. The only exceptions are Engineer and Elementalist, whose class mechanics replace the weapon swap. 
---
Anyway, all classes have at least one or two ranged options, and most classes have at least one considered good. In open world I'd say most people run 1 melee + 1 ranged set. That said, ranged even when it is good is often not used *as ranged* in the instanced meta. This is for a lot of reasons, mostly because this game doesn't have tanking mechanics to hold the boss to one player, and because the majority of group buffs and heals are point-blank AoE.
---
For ranged classes, Ranger is probably nicest, since you have a pet that can aggro enemies and you can shoot them from distance while they're distracted; however it does significantly more damage with melee weapons, and is tanky enough to handle melee range. Necromancer has some ranged capabilities and lots of summonable minions as well. However, it's a bit of a meme at this point that this strategy doesn't transition well to being effective in group content. Elementalist also has a lot of ranged and mid-ranged capabilities, and traditionally very high skill ceiling, but it can't weapon swap during combat, and due to its low health is often the first of a party to be downed when an encounter goes south. All of the other classes have melee options, but these are the 3 I can think of that fare decently in casual PvE.
---
As always, [here's](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guide:What_Profession_Should_I_Play) a guide to the classes and how they play ingame to help you choose what suits your preferred style. Although, really, this game is very alt-friendly and leveling goes by quickly, so it never hurts to try a couple to 20 and see which core mechanics you like best.
---
Fjord is that you?
---
This is why I don't like Canach.  He keeps betting on my success...and then not giving me a cut.
---
I would actually roll a sylvari again.
---
Thanks! Yeah I’m more likely going for guardian with GS/Scepter. I kinda like the kind of hard to kill build also. If not range then I would like hard to kill toons, and it’s looking like guardian is the way to go.
---
I hate to break this to you, but Thanos memes aren't funny.
---
Most memes aren't funny.
---
the fucking manic delivery of this line is what gets me every time
---
&gt; I have Swim down, Mount 2 and Lock ground target in the same key: Shift.
---
I used to have Skill 8 and Swim Down on Ctrl, but then Bond of Faith became Mount Skill 8. Welp :/
---
Wow, you seem to just not have a sense of humor if you think most memes aren’t funny, especially Thanos memes. You must be fun at parties.
---
I want viney hairs and beards now! I think a String of pearls plant might make good sylvari hair too. Brb, gotta check etsy for sylvari head plant pots
---
I am an OG, and good looking ladies half my age ask me to Tango with them.
---
They sure seem to think I'm fun at parties.
---
Learn what your blocks and dodges are, and how and when to use them. HoT is a rude awakening for a lot of people (myself included, back in the day), but after a while you'll learn how to handle it and be a better player for it. Also, definitely get comfortable with all of your abilities, traits, and gear, and how they interact.   
---
 Look up stuff on the wiki, read up on combo fields, and make choices about what you want to focus on in combat. Having an intentionally statted character is a lot better than having a hodgepodge character, even if you're not using an optimized raid/fractal meta build.
---
* Jump from high with griffon.  
---
* Press Dive immediately.
---
* While diving, wait 1-2 seconds and press Space for a speed Boost.  
---
* Stop pressing dive at that moment and enjoy going as fast as a beetle but flying around.  
---
* Whenever you want, press mount abbility 2 to get back all the altitude lost while diving (you only recover it if you did the speed boost).
---
* At the highest altitude, press space to flap wings.  
---
  
---
You just learnt how to get higher than what it was your starting altitude on griffon.
---
I have a mighty need
---
Damn you’ve just proved my point. Who the fuck says “tango with them”? I highly doubt it’s even true. Thanos memes are funny, if you don’t think so go to r/Dankmemes and see how many upvotes they get.
---
So a Korok, then.
---
one thing pvp and wvw have in common a lot is to have a proper build so you dont get 1 shot or so youre not completely useless to your self or the group entirely.
---
So you could focus on trying to play with some different kinds of open world pve builds with various professions. Some of them can even "break the game".
---
A minionmancer necro (even a core one) can solo a lot of champions, even HoT ones. People often go condi with it, but if you go for pure dire stats youll have your self the most unkillable open world pve build in the game (that also deals decent dmg). 
---
Same goes with a similar berserker build, and even a guardian one.
---
Dont like condi? Want something thats not tanky? How about a glass cannon reaper with perma quickness and tons of might and power?
---
Speaking of quickness, concentration stats can make some crazy builds out there as well.
---
A commander + diviner firebrand has some rly great dmg out there, has pretty balanced armor, and also has perma protection, swiftness, regeneration, quickness, 20-25 might, fury, retaliation, vigor.... and can share some of those boons with others as well for a very long time, if not permanently.
---
Can also go with a similar combo on a core /spellbreaker warrior with gs + axe/axe or dagger/axe. perma 25might, fury, quickness almost always up. 
---
Can also have some fun with 100% boon duration on a arcana ele, and ranger to a degree. 
---
Mesmers are also fun to play as and with. With amazing group support within dungeons,fractals and raids, but also portals in open world for jumping puzzles (specially the dailies) you can even get various stuff form other players who love you for porting. This player interaction is something completely new you will experience if you come from pvp and wvw.
---
Perma stealth thieves can also be very fun to play within mini dungeons or Jumping puzzles.
---
And also, a general idea of trying to solo group content can be very challenging and fun such as dungeons, fractals, hard hero challenges, bounties etc
---
FEAR THE FIRES IF BALTHAZAR
---
I know when I want to talk about my daughter, I always call her "mother"
---
The bottom line for "What does this mean for me, as a consumer?"
---
1. You play one main character- You probably won't notice.
---
2. You play one main character and multiple side characters infrequently- Your main can jump around pretty freely, but your side characters can only jump around once in a blue moon.
---
3. You play multiple characters regularly without a main- It'll be mildly inconvenient, you may have to wait a few minutes sometimes.
---
4. You play very little on multiple characters, and only when you need to do events- This item is not for you.
---
Make sure you have level 80 exotic weapons and armor, also.  It should have stats that correspond with how you play.  A lot of people play by "using whatever drops" and get slaughtered by tougher enemies.  
---
I will painfully admit that's how I played at first, running around in armor with mixed stats, mixed runes, mixed levels.
---
I heard those lines as representing separate beings. But  I guess we can’t really know without more info...
---
You can use it to navigate the map for collections and events using the Prototype Position Rewarding
---
depends on the location we are going really. But id love to get a greatsword as a weapon and focus on some kind of a durable warrior. 
---
Tho...a durable warrior doesnt sound like something the SC and raid community would appreciate
---
Afking intensifies
---
You could even decorate the guild hall.
---
I will be real, i played every mmorpg out there, if you want a really good pvp scene i would say go for ESO, between all mmorpgs that i played ESO have the most fun thing Cyrodill ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAmaLygmBes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAmaLygmBes) ).
---
Gw2 pvp had better days, Wvw scene is pretty much dead(unless during reset day), spvp is full of bots and ppl cursing you, the balance is really fucked(was worst tho.. got little better).....
---
I had my fun with pvp in gw2 but i really cant advise a newplayer that is looking for pvp exclusivly game.
---
And to be fair if you only want some pvp i dont know if i would advise to play a mmorpg, cause most of them you gotta do some pve in order to get some stuff needed for pvp (ffxiv doesnt have that but it is literally the worst mmorpg pvp that i even seen)...
---
I’ve been using this thread to track the collection. Saturday’s reset would’ve been the first reset after completing all the feeding. Does anyone have any information after that one?
---
This has a post earlier on! I’ll link it if I can figure out mobile Reddit easier.
---
I have cleared this content on a couple classes and I recommend playing a little non standard tankier build. Instead of zerks gear mix in some valkyrie or something with a little toughness. I also usually take a ranged weapon and a defensive off-hand along. Looking at your build for safety options.  Things to break stuns or go immune. HoT can be really fun I just have learned I need to approach it differently.
---
At least it seems they realized they done us wrong by making Braham the way he was in LW3 and early part of LW4. I am glad, it will always be my sore spot but sooner they leave that bad characterization of him behind the better.
---
The non Ley-infused one is south from the pact WP in Melandrus Domain.
---
I eagerly await the chungus skyscale skin considering how much food we give the little bugger
---
Very well said. :-) I can't agree more than that. 
---
Today somebody told in /map "it's like SW and DS" had a baby.
---
So true. Awesome for me.
---
No, that's a bug. Happens even on full maps.
---
I wonder who built this statue. I mean it's from Melandrus realm and not from Tyria, but none of the creatures in the area seem to be able to build such a statue.
---
Nature elemental spawns on a fresh map after Logan and Rytlock take melandrus hold. It spawns a little southeast of the place “The Skein” on the map
---
Anyone got the collection for after the feeding? Today (pre-reset) should’ve had people doing it.
---
Try when it is raining :P
---
I had this happen to me for the skale treat but it did drop again. Keep trying.
---
Yeah the fight option is for another achievement that's specifically set in vabbi if I'm not mistaken.
---
It slows you down though while mount 2 just pulls up.
---
Would be a crazy plot twist.
---
The funny part about all these different lines people keep saying is that we all know the NPC's that use all those lines. It's not just that we know the lines but we know exactly which NPC says it.
---
Lmao imagine next step having to train it once a day for 20 days.. :")
---
More beards for humans, more tattoos for Norn, more hairstyles for Sylvari, more skin patterns for Asura and more Horns for Charr.
---
Being one of the first to have something like that is just personally gratifying to me. I had the griffon on day 2 of PoF, haha. Just something I like to do.
---
Why do you think you need to log on for 5 hours for this?
---
I was thinking about that and maybe it was Melandru's followers? Since Kormir had some of her followers in her library I suspect Melandru had some as well and as Melandru left they did like the people in Kormir's library so that's why there no actual people.
---
Does it still count as veganism? 😏
---
That's fair :) to each their own!
---
Melandru probably asked Malchor to sculpt her some statues she could place in her realm. The gods may have been more narcissistic than we thought.
---
Gw2 uses like 15 years old engine, it has always been like this and will be =)
---
Did you catch cold ? "cough" 
---
Do you want me to bring you some skyscale medicine ?
---
Canach was present, you can see him in the first instance during the arrival at Dragonfall.  He just doesn't have any lines.
---
They'll farm the heck out of the festival of the four winds :0
---
Your friends abandoned the game? Would you like... a new friend?  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I like dark humor and shitposting so Nazdagorpls™ is not for everyone. Consult your doctor before asking.
---
I also liked the story, but what parts do you disagree on? Aurene getting rezzed? Voices? I honestly liked it. Obvious plot isn't always a bad one.
---
No.
---
I mean, it's a video game with its own developed lore.
---
for centuries many cultures viewed Glint as a mother-type figure - she raised entire generations, entire *species*. kept them from harm, taught them unique magicks, and unlocked the secrets of Ascension hundreds of years prior to GW2's story.
---
he could've either been talking about Glint as much of the privileged society knew her - this mother figure, someone to follow and listen to - or Aurene, the first meaningfully benevolent Elder Dragon we've thus far ever considered, who will shepherd the mortal races into a new age of magic and technology - as a *benefactor*, not an antagonist.
---
Not all of them, but there's certain faces that look less human and more like the fantasy cutesy human with slightly asiatic features you'll find in a lot of asian games. 
---
IIRC it was even said at some point that for the character creation one guy on the art team went to East Asia to find out how to have faces that also appeal to Asian sensibilities/ideals. I wish I could find the source, but I can say with certainty that it was a thing.

*it's not valuable to exploit it for porting around jumping puzzles and chests, but is useful to join your party and play with them for a while.

*As if that was the original idea of whole teleport to friend, riiiight....*

On Guardian, GS is high damage and good fun. Scepter/focus is high damage, and has a nice shield on focus 5(so it's pretty tanky).
---
Depends if you like doing same heart events over and over (and over) again or not.
---
Check for flashy icon above your minimap, that's where levelup rewards appear.
---
It's mostly the same old gold and materials sink, there's nothing else to it really
---
Sales are frequent, as the other poster mentioned. The [prices have been lower in the past](https://isthereanydeal.com), though. Whether you *should* buy them, no one can tell, except you.

Deluxe gives you, among other things, an additional char slot, and the Lily of Elon pass. If you are alt-o-holic the former is of course useful. GW2 is one of those games where I personally wanted to try all classes. And I need one more for "key farming". 
---
Lily of Elon pass lets you port to an area in the crystal desert where you have everything in one place, bank, guild bank, Trading Post, all crafting stations, etc. Later in the game those passes are super convenient, although I personally do not go to LoE, but Mistlock Sanctuary. For me the setup there is better. But LoE is still in my shared inventory for porting to the desert area for free. 
---
Other items are a skin, and a repair kit. The later is used when you want to re-roll character creation, i.e. looks, etc. The skin is exclusive I think (not sure, fashion is not my thing), and the repair kit you can get otherwise, either with money, or BL keys. The later involves weekly farming for a while. 
---
Hard to tell whether it is useful for you. LoE pass is certainly convenient, the rest depends on your play style.
---
Stuff like that has always been counted in log-in tyime.
---
Not to mention, they all landed "flat" with their trees pointing up.  Weird. I expected more of a Post-Searing Ascalon look to rocks that fell out of the sky.
---
Not beating around the bush are you?
---
The thing was that there were only few of us. I did this pretty much late so there were not that many people who could help.
---
No I don't like that at all
---
Not sure what scepter/focus is. Is that like a tree/build path?
---
He's gonna make it rain!
---
Oh you're right about that. It's optimized for single core CPUs and is very CPU heavy. The graphics have little to do with fps most of the time unfortunately
---
I missed while aiming the ibolga treat and lost it. But I was able to get another to drop.
---
Take a look!
---
the option to volunteer appears because people are already leaving that specific map en masse to go farm bridges, if the volunteer pop up appears the map is already half empty by then
---
Well, Joko's magic is in Aurene, that we know for sure. And the consumed magic alters the carrier, this we know, too. So ... I wonder what's gonna happen in the third add-on :-)
---
Is there any way to check if the ascended armor is from WvW/PvP or crafted? I am keen on making a legendary armor but I cannot remember the source of my armor sets.

Since I wasn't sure if you got subtitles, I spent the 30 minutes to get them written for you, here you go:

I doubt it. Elder dragons have lifetimes that are eons long, it would be silly to have everything eventful happen in like five years.
---
I have an i7 7700k and 1070ti and all I can say is...
---
there's no helping it. This game has trash optimization with a very old engine.
---
I tip commanders who comunicate a lot, have squad messages explaining stuff, etc. Most commanders don't exactly put in a lot of effort which is totally fine since it's enough 99% of the time. But those who do deserve a treat and I give it to them. Doesn't happen very often though.
---
Commander .. A word..

Glowing is good and all, but you just know that those trees will belong to (Mordre)moths.

But it doesn't change the game. If you want the 2 gold and 3 spirit shards, you can get them from core dailies alone.  It's not like he won't get those rewards. Having the larger pool of dailies isn't necessarily an advantage. Sometimes an easier daily is replaced by a daily you don't like from one of the expansions like an adventure. I've seen complaints about that on the forums, although only rarely.  IF you don't have PoF instead of desert lumberer you get one of the core gathering dailies. Same for vistas. It's not like it makes a difference in whether you buy the game or not. You get the same number of dailies. The only time the game will give you a daily you can't do is if you delete a character after you've hit 80. Then it still gives you 80th level dailies even though you no longer have an 80th level character.
---
Even if you only have the core game, you'll get core dailies that are different if you're lower level. For example if the daily is Frostgorge event completer but the highest level character you've had on your account is 20 or so, you'll get a different event completer at your level.
---
Source: I have ten accounts and I've spent some time tracking dailes, just because I was interested.
---
Point of interest: On your very first character, your dailies unlock slowly so at first you'll get only one PvE, one PvP and one WvW daily and you would have to do all three to get your daily but once you go through that on your first character, it never happens again.
---
The bottom 2 are definitely my favorite of the 4
---
&gt; Okay, I want to be honest. 
---
I don't believe that at all.
