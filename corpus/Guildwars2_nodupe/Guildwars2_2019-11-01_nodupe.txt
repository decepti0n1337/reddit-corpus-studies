Fair enough, and as a non programming type I'm not familiar enough to say how difficult my request is, but it might be a nice tie over to consider while alliance is being developed. I don't think any big festival is needed just a little boost in XP to lower the barrier of entry for some noobs. And it benefits vets as well. Plus you'd help build a bigger player base for alliances.

The first "tab" is still equipment as before, but all other ones are not in the API
---
The servers have been fucked up for months now, not worth playing. Not to mention the massive buffs and debuffs every three months that completely screw ur build and u have to start from scratch ( this is not an overstatement) just so three months later they roll back all the changes from last patch and add a few more which changes the entire class again, and then u have to AGAIN change your build, your skills, get new gear coz the ones u were using before arent going to cut.
---

---
And then, guess what? It happens again, they change everything AGAIN! And now everything u did goes to waste and you have to start over, learn your class again, and u cant even remember the changes they did six months ago coz they changed the game so drasticly that they were overwritten.
---
No explanation is given about the changes either with the exception of half a dozen.
---
And the really, really bad performance.
---
While in gw2, during a world boss, with tons of ppl around me the highest my ping went was 190.
---
In wow, even in a crowded boralus, it never went above 200.
---
In eso, in a good day, alone in my own house, which is instanced, i get 250 at least, but more often the not, 300+. Also the random loading screens, crashes and rollbacks that happens in cyrodill. ( Which arent only with me, u cant play for more than 30min in cyrodill without seeing someone complaining about lag.
---
And recently, they deactivated the activity finder, which completely negates the ability to do battlegrounds, since that was the only way to get in a match. I dont know if they reversed that change, im not playing it anymore, ive had enough, but a lot of ppl lost their main way of pvping, battlegrounds.
---
/Rantover
---
It will still be useful for landing burst and locking down targets.
---
Basically all (most) game companies with their big games have test servers for that reason where interested players can test the next update.
---
It has been pointed out the same day they gave the preview that this will likely happen yet they didn't listen on a single feedback on Reddit.
---
Kinda sad to see the situation. I never got much involved in ESO due to it being basically a "single player MMO", and the game itself felt kinda soulless.
---
Still, for how much they charge in mandatory DLCs, expacs etc it's quite meh.  Gw2 isn't certainly at the top of it's performance right now, but damn.. When you look at many other triple A MMOs it almost looks like it's doing well, lol.
---
The only exception right now is probably FF, but I tired that one too and I can't really get to like it, and no matter the quality of service... The given content still doesn't feel that much worth or a monthly sub.
---
What's up with all the Fallout comparisons lately?
---
It sucks even more - so what? Would you compare cow poop and horse poop and debate about which one is less bad?
---
Havent played in about 3 years. Thinking of coming back. I used to mainly do PvP, but I really wanna get into PvE this time.  Could someone please summarize the state of the game atm ? What is the PvE endgame, and is it worth coming back now ? I feel like its a little too late ?
---
A 'season system' would be awesome, maybe leave out the 'premium buy in trend' that devs like to use. It's a hot trend in MMOs that GW2 has had the tools to implement but doesn't for some reason... 
---
Basically a meta reward track for that last a month or something and gives unique rewards. Add some variable to define the 'season' or make it interesting, like Season 1 no downstate, Season 2 a legendary NPC goes around wrecking your stuff, Season 3 dual classes, Season 4 return of the Orb mechanic, etc. 
---
Purists will complain but it gives everyone else something new to do. Keeps the mode fresh. Make the seasons short enough so that even if the variable isn't a hit its only temporary.
---
All the development projects ive been on in the last decade have been agile.  
---
And yes, ArenaNet could benefit from a PTR.
---
If only you could change the title
---
~~But wasn't Metal Legion the best event evah?~~
---
The initial change was what was going to be monitored. This change is the result of that. It is hardly a nerf by 99%.
---
Normally I’m inclined to agree with this, but many of these bugs are things that became immediately obvious just when trying to do routine things in game. “I tried to swap my build and crashed an entire instance” for example became immediately evident. “I swapped weapons to one not in my set and it took the sigils and infusions out of my legendary and I had to shove them back in” is something that should be immediately noticeable as a problem. “Hey literally everything breaks if you enter a game mode like Clock Tower where you lose your skills/equipment temporarily” etc.
---
This feels like it was barely tested at all even internally.
---
10 -&gt; 5 = 99 % nerf......
---
TIL
---
Precasting was never about boons, there's pre booning which is different and people have been precasting barrage/meteor shower etc for years. There's a reason most speedclear players play with their inventory open with weapons in specific spots to quick swap to. :-)
---
By removing the culprit class entirely from the game aye.
---
I mean what else is scourge for? PVE? spvp? lol
---
There's a https://buildpad.gw2archive.eu/version.json if you fancy parsing some jsons. Calculating MD5s for every version I release is something *I* don't have the motivation for. :D
---
If you can tell me how to do versioning better - I'll do it. I can't delete the currently running version of the plugin, because Windows doesn't allow deleting files that are currently running. So I must have at least 2 versions side by side, and upon ArcDPS attempting to load each of them I must check if it's the newer version of the two. I do that in DllMain, because it was the only place in which I could "fail" the loading of the dll without triggering error logging from ArcDPS. Now, to read the "actual built-in version numbers" I must either come up with a way to parse windows executables, or load all the .dlls again to check their version via an exported function. Doing that will involve calling DllMain again, which would restart this entire process, and we'll be stuck in an infinite loop.
---
So, can we just roll back the whole idiotic "either on self or on shade" crap-change that screwed up PvE scourges? No? You're always right? 
---
Okay :(
---

---
Were you playing in dedicated fullscreen mode? Addons which draw over the top of GW2 only work for windowed-fullscreen mode.
---
Json will do, thanks.
---
As for auto updating - I've been there before and it's a pain in the ass, you need multiple executables to be able to do a nice clean job of it. 
---
I'd say leave auto updating for the tools such as mine and fmmmlee's. It's out of your scope and everyone already uses tools such as mine, so why not focus on making it easy for them to incorporate BuildPad rather than doing extra work for no reason other than your own fun - the json is enough for me though, so again thanks.
---
[This is what I meant by built in versions.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1755504/programmatically-get-the-version-number-of-a-dll) It's C# but you get the idea. It's more of a pain in the ass for you to do, definitely. But in my experience any time you leave something able to be screwed by the user, they'll screw it for sure.
---
Gw2's reward structure is a bit unique. Players don't keep the vast majority of the stuff they loot, it all converts out to gold. There are rewards in the game players want, but the nature of Gw2's structure is one of earning gold, then spending it on items you want, and to many I think that feels less fulfilling than working on an exact item.
---
So what you're saying is... Ban Microsoft? :thinking:
---
Incoming ban wave because it cuts into revenue stream. Omegalul.
---
...but seriously though...if ANet actually bans people for it, the shit storm will be so huge that even the gods will abandon Tyria...owait.....
---
Asura mesmer Blade Flurry (Sword 2)???
---
Cheaper than $20?  No offense, but if $20 is too much, it's time to get a job rather than playing video games.
---
Staff 2 is still a low cooldown port to port spots and mobility  
---
Staff 5 still gives Aegis fairly frequently in addition to inflicting debilitating conditions like Weakness and Chill.  
---
With chaotic dampening, you still get protection on demand with Staff 4 and you can combo leaps with Staff 5 for more protection  
---
But I guess utility = damage, thus low damage ergo useless, eh?
---
I'm guess you don't play pvp
---
Uhmm, I literally just asked if its worth coming back to the game in 2019 in the daily questions thread. Now I come here and I see people saying game is falling apart.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Can someone please fill me in on whats going on ? Why are people upset ?
---
Late for what?  If you've missed three years, you've missed out on a lot of PvE.  The end of LS3, the release of Path of Fire, and all of LS4.  The next step for the game is the Icebrood Saga, a prologue episode for which has also released.
---
There's no 'worth it' to coming back.  The game's here, and it's ready to be played.  Do you want to play it?  Will you have fun playing?  There's plenty of players still playing, there's lots left to do, especially if you've been away for as long as you have.  So if you want to take the plunge, jump in.
---
make one of the punishment utilities clear all shades, then us weaver players will welcome you with open arms.

The shakeup is coming around the same time Alliances are introduced ;)
---
When I see my Voice in the Void it is meaningful to me because I did it myself and I still remember the killrun. When I see other Voice in the Voids I think it is probably bought or was given free. Ask teapot how many dhuum cms he gave away for free or sold. There are barely any truely rewards that mean something because it is either easy to get (by playing, tp or gemstore), rng based or you can make people get it for you.
---
No manifesto I just vote with my wallet and call ppl out on their hypocrisy and bs when I see it.
---
I really hope you are right. I love this game. But I've worked for companies that have consistent release schedules of products. You don't usually hype random other stuff and stray from that cadence without any additional info. There's just no reason to. I think if they were planning an expansion any time soon they would have already gave hints at it. The fact that templates were their big thing, imo, either means an expansion isn't coming, or isn't coming for a long long time.
---
I totally get your point about the story. And I hope you are right.
---
Meaningful would be something worth keeping, not salvaging or selling. I don't care about the hundreds of blues and greens, a single exotic with a skin I don't have is worth much more to me. Something that gets me progress towards a goal beyond "get gold".
---
You have a good point, friend. I'll see how BuildPad handles updating in the coming weeks. If it works fine, it works fine. No need to do more than necessary.
---
They're trying to fix a mistake they made during a previous update, and are pushing balance in the right direction, and you're still bashing them?
---
I agree it was frustrating to see them go on with the scourge changes after the community reaction, but this post right here is a good thing for WvW, and deserve some support.
---
Beside, Cal “cmc” Cohen [just took](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/updates-from-the-systems-team/) the head of the WvW balance team, he's not the one who made scourge what they are now (in WvW or PvE).
---
Hi, I love your piece. Could I ask you why you switched to clip studio? I was taught to only use photoshop as its more professional but lately im not so sure.
---
Just plain old PvE. Seemed to subside after the new build tonight
---
Has Anet commented on the fuck up that is the build template yet? I literally hop between PVE, PVP and WvW all the time, this change makes it so fucking annoying
---
So what? They HAD years to do it or at least fix vital parts of that. AND they had the manpower! They aren't a 5 man garage company - although it feels like they are.
---
After some thought, I feel like rewards depend a lot on context. In a vertical progression game, gear that increases numerically and increases power, thereby opening up the possibility to see and defeat new content is meaningful.
---
In something like Warframe, grinding for warframe or weapon parts that can eventually be built to open up new styles/variety of play and enable more cool fashion is meaningful.
---
So you’d think that any rewards in GW2 that open up the possibility to see and defeat new content (masteries? mounts?), open up new styles/variety of play (elite specs?) and enables cool fashion (new skins) would be meaningful.
---
Still, I note that a lot of new skins have recently been released in GW2, and I feel mostly unmotivated to grind for them. This leads me to think that there are a few other unconsidered factors. 
---
One, how much ‘use’ will I get out of this new skin? Do I like it? Will I get to see it on myself very often? Will others be able to see it on me? (For those more motivated by prestige.) Will I be able to complete some kind of collection? (For collection completists - getting more and more impossible each day with all the things they’ve thrown in now.) I probably would need to have gameplay opportunities for that, and if I’m overall less motivated to play the game by other factors, my ‘need’ or desire for a cool skin diminishes.
---
Two, what do I have to do to get the reward? Is it innately fun or interesting to me, or is it either boring/tedious/repetitive or frustratingly impossible for me? 
---
Example: I was pleasantly surprised on unlocking a collection quest after eating one of the new Halloween foods. I was all gungho to go and do it, then I saw that they were lengthy, involved a Deepstone fractal (ugh, I hate fractals, that’s just me and a personal preference) and basically wouldn’t get done in the 30 min of the aura. Aka make more food and eat when near the end of each tedious thing. Too many steps for me to even contemplate, so I put it down and did something else.
---
Three, does the reward have some meaningful context? Does it mark a memorable moment in time? Is it sentimental in some way? 
---
When we had the quick pace of the early Living Story, I thought there were some things that had that context. Karka themed skins around Southsun. I still love my Emissary of the Mad King title marking that first Halloween. The molten jetpack was so desirable at the time.
---
In more recent goings on, I think the raptor mount is meaningful because it’s tied to the PoF story and is your very first mount, opening up a whole new style of play. Aurene-related stuff at the time of her relationship with us is probably seen as meaningful by a decent subset. If you raid and kill Dhuum and pop your very first Oblivion or throne or Dhuum skins, I bet that has a decent amount of meaning. Just this Halloween, I unlocked the pumpkin crown the other day and rather enjoy it - to me, it has meaning in the context of the Halloween season to be able to put a pumpkin on my head and look appropriately dressed for the festivities.
---
Everyone levitates while casting Reaper greatsword 2, and it has no cooldown sometimes.
---
It's a bit ironic the apologists do the most harm.
---
&gt; If you don't like it, leave!
---
&gt; Why is everyone gone?
---
Although I dont agree with the holo nerfs, since their sustain for investing pretty much nothing into healing stats, was the issue, also, the stability is still kinda long. But lets see how this pans out, at the very least Rampage was finally brought down a notch, and condi mesmers and thieves as well, maybe more builds can make an appearance now.
---
The other scourge changes mentioned here are probably PvP/WvW related, since Cal Cohen's team is not in charge of PvE balance.
---
That being said, I wouldn't be surprised to see PvE scourge rebalanced in a future update. This is probably the kind of things they had in mind when they decided to [split balance teams](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/updates-from-the-systems-team/) between PvE and competitive modes.
---
I did forget about CM, but the other two don't count.  She wasn't actually at the Queen's Jubilee in S1, just a fake image of her Anise made.  And she didn't meet with us during the World Summit, she was in the audience when we gave a speech and asked us a question.  I went to a speech by James Earl Jones in college.  If I said this made me "true friends" with him, I'd look like a nutty stalker.
---
fair enough.  fight the good fight man.
---
That is what cmc is doing, yes.
---
I think the plan is to address TTK in that larger patch he keeps mentioning that's coming down the road. At least that's how it sounds based on what he says in the post
---
He went from being one of the main content creators that spoke out when the company fucked up and gave them feedback to the main ass-kisser in the company, defending everything they do even when they did gigantic mistakes.
---
I doubt it. They seemed to be focused mainly on whatever garbage mobile ideas and projects they had in mind.
---
Even the F2P trailer that was made felt like it was done for a mobile game.
---
&gt;This is actually a bit of a testament to Anet's development.
---
A testament to how broken it all is, yes.
---
Except they mention they are going to chance Mirage Cloak in the future.
---
&gt;I can understand that the Mad King's tower is such a special place with special rules that they didn't specifically test that
---
That would make sense........if they didn't decide to release this DURING the event that lets you go into the tower.

&gt;* [Infinite loading screens.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dpps0h/infinite_loading_screen_for_fractals/ "Infinite loading screens.")
---
&gt;And that is only a few of the issues that we found **in 2 days**. 
---
&gt;So I think it's time for Anet to really stop for a moment and think about the current status of a player experience and then re-work Build Templates even if that delays the next episode, because let's face it, we can't play with the current iteration. You know **reworking Heart of Thorns, 2 months after its release, saved that expansion**; now we need something like that to save the game from the mess build templates created. I want that but I'm not sure about others, so it's poll time!
---
&gt;In that direction, this is in my opinion the best suggestion to fix the system. It's simple, elegant and gets the job done:  
---
&gt;* [A different approach](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dp58v6/a_different_approach_to_arenanets_build_templates/ "A different approach ")
---
&gt;It's great because it also addressed the bloat the UI is now. This design would make [minis, mail carriers, trinkets](https://i.imgur.com/0nY7vAw.png "minis, mail carriers, trinkets") and many long-time issues go away.
---
&gt;**Bonus:** This is a must-do IMO and Anet feel really disconnected from the playerbase for not doing it: [Build Equipment Slots should be accountwise](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dos3e3/i_feel_like_equipment_build_template_slots_should/ "Build Equipment Slots should be accountwise")

&gt;Grothmar Wardowns and Dragonfall both hit the mark for a lot of people.
---
Must be nice thinking two maps must mean everything is fine.
---
I wouldn't say it's all that obvious. 
---
Pve is through a megaserver after all. While instances do fill up enough to complete the meta with relative ease, there's no way of telling how many people we're actually talking about.
---
&gt; I'm a programmer myself but I'll use a different example: Building a house from the ground make take years if only 1 person works on it, or 1 month if there is 30 persons working on it. That's how time bends on big projects. This game is no different.
---
Well done. You've just proven that you have no clue how software development works.
---
You have to learn how to read. I didn't say everything was fine. I said that you're only looking at what you're looking at. Show me once where I said build templates are good or acceptable. Any quote, anywhere. You won't find that quote, because I've never said it.  Build templates are underwhelming at the very least and it's a bad look any way you take it.   
---
That doesn't change the fact that good things haven't been done and people haven't been enjoying parts of the game. You might not like or play those parts, but other people do.  You not being happy with one thing doesn't make everything in the game shit. That's just not how it works.
---
It really doesn't need a full rework, the system itself is actually not that bad. A few odd decisions here and there, the account-wide slots feel like an unnecessarily limited addition for the sake of adding more monetisation, but other than the bugs it does what I want it to, feels easy to use and with hotkeys it's very quick to swap builds.
---
I'm just talking about the reaction to those zones here on reddit and on the forums. Most people seemed to like them. People talked about them. The reaction was generally positive. 
---
  
---
We hear a ton of complaints when things go bad, but we also here some good stuff. Generally complaints get more of a push because people enjoying the game are doing just that.
---
I run a casual guild of about 350 people and no one in the guild is railing against templates, because none of them would use templates all that much to begin with. In fact, most of the people in my guild have never used ARC DPS.
---
Reddit gives you a prism. A spectrum. We hear a lot from the most vested, hardest core players here. People who raid, competitively PvP or WvW are more likely to be here. As far as I know, very few of the people in my guild but me look at reddit, certainly not regularly. 
---
But many of them play quite frequently, blissfullly unaware that this whole thing is going on. I"m saying those zones were well received. It's obvious because if they weren't, we'd have heard about it (re Kourna). People were playing and posting. That's how you tell if something is well received.
---
There was a dev statement a while ago that something like 40% (I don't recall the exact number) of the playerbase had never been to the trait screen.  That blew my mind. Do you think that 40% of the playbase cares about build templates?
---
&gt; You have to learn how to read.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;  You not being happy with one thing doesn't make everything in the game shit 
---
And then you I need to learn to read. Do tell me where i said everything in the game is shit.
---
this is amazing. thank you so much
---
Shortbow is pretty effective as a condition spammer and honestly if the "longbow" look is important to you there are plenty of shortbow skins that aren't short at all. :P Some even look like longbows.
---
they are. while the general consensus among the community atm is that this is bullshit, there are a few scum lurking around just waiting until people stop caring and move on, they will then take control of the narrative and make it seem like everyone who ever had an issue with anet is just a troll. they are already spending money on templates as we speak, anet are gonna listen to them, not us.

When did Bethesda's Fallout 76 team start working for Gold wars?

**The Mythical Man-Month**
---
The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering is a book on software engineering and project management by Fred Brooks first published in 1975, with subsequent editions in 1982 and 1995. Its central theme is that "adding manpower to a late software project makes it later". This idea is known as Brooks' law, and is presented along with the second-system effect and advocacy of prototyping.
---
Brooks' observations are based on his experiences at IBM while managing the development of OS/360.

How many other major western MMOs lock these basic features behind paywalls and try to triple-monetize them? I quite literally cannot think of one.
---
"Developers have rent to pay" is facetious. Game developers are notoriously underpaid and overworked by companies who are making millions/billions in profits... *including ArenaNet*. This is a pretty basic, well-known farce the industry relies on: players arguing "well how will they afford xyz if they don't exploit people!" when the solution is right in front of them. Don't exploit people.

*Somehow*, the industry operated successfully within its means for decades before they realized they could MTX everything and some people would pay for it. Incredibly, this same company ran one of the most successful western F2P MMOs of its era without relying on predatory MTX! Telling players to be happy a company is fucking them because 'well think of the developers' (who are not, in fact, any better off for this) is just boot-licking.
---
If ArenaNet refuses to monetize in a way that is ethical and pro-consumer, they deserve consumer ire. And in the long term if they struggle... *that's good*. They can either assess how they operate and stop trying to dick people over which would benefit both their product and community, or they can die like other predatory companies when people get fed up. The ball is in their court.

Can i have one
---
Doesn't taco have a notepad function? The tin foil hatters who don't like arc can use that instead.
---
Worked Great!  thank you very much
---
It's also terrible for raid bosses that don't just stand in place.
---
I’m only gonna be replying the same thing I’ve already stated from now on. If you want more than 2-3 builds per character, then pay up. Boo hoo.
---
I'd like one if you got spares
---
what is the icebrood sage bundle by chance?
---
If you still got some leftover I'd take one aswell please.
---
not anymore
---
Wasn't there a Golem Rush or something similar in WvW at some point?
---
Scourge, ultimately, should not be a roaming class. It was designed with AoE denial and support in mind. Neither of those things scream 'roaming' to me. Small scale fighting perhaps, but not solo roaming. I think it is a bit of a mistake to try to chase every class, and especially every elite spec, being viable in every playstyle/mode. It simply isn't feasible or possible without making them all near identical and destroying their uniqueness.
---
With that out of the way, I would love to see some ranged strength given back to scourges, but it should not be in the form of shades. Some love to their weapons, primarily with some game wide sweeping changes to staff, and perhaps some small buffs to their off hands would go a long way to helping not just scourges but necros roaming in general.
---
I think they put the teams in charge of what goes in the game and what goes in the cash shop from Bethesda Austin, Oh and the QA team.
---
Literally *every other contemporary MMO allows this*. ArenaNet took seven years to implement a BASIC MMO feature, spent 2 years supposedly developing it, and the result is worse than a fanmade add-on and triple-monetized to boot. That's fucking heinous, I'm sorry.
---
As for builds... it really isn't hard to run a lot if you play several game modes. I would say that while I have a pretty vested interest in a singular class and play pretty casual these days, I still have:
---
 * PVE Power DH
---
 * PVE Condi FB
---
 * WvW Minstrels FB
---
 * WvW Roamer DH
---
 * SPvP Bunker FB
---
 * SPvP Meditrapper DH
---
That's six builds already. And since I main Guardian in PVE, I need to be conscious of the fact that Healbrand is highly desirable now. That will put me at a seventh build. Quickbrand is also super useful/wanted in raids, that would be an eighth set. Double Bunker FB isn't ideal in SPvP, so at some point I really need to set up Symbol FB when I start working on Ascension again.
---
The build template slots literally don't exist. They aren't there. And this is just guardian- it is *so much worse* for Mesmer players interested in this kind of content.
---
Even my old main, the old reliable, ranger:
---
 * PVE Condi SB
---
 * PVE Power SB
---
 * PVE Heal/Boon Druid
---
 * WvW Roamer SB
---
 * SPvP Bunker Druid
---
 * SPvP Power Ranger
---
Already capped at six. God help me if any other builds look interesting!
---
The monetization here is vile. Not even WildStar (God rest its soul) had templates this poorly functioning nor horribly monetized. ANet is alone in this field. Stop giving them a pass.
---
Having that many builds is nothing by excessive. Wanting them all for free is nothing but entitled. The game was designed to only run 1 build at a time, if you want more than 2-3, then pay up. Boo hoo.
---
If you grab your API from the main ArenaNet account page and plug it in to GW2efficiency, you can look up all sorts of neat stats. They are mostly object, unlock, and rank-based things, not like what you're looking for. But, by browsing GW2E I know that there is someone with 1,632 broken spoons in their inventory and that that person has played for 14,026 hours  :)
---
Ahhh, yes, I remember now. Those poor afk people lol. That's neat though, Never knew about the bonuses! Wish they would do something similar again; right now it seems like the only motivation to win is if the fights are too easy or people will purposely lose to stay/go down a tier if they're up against a server that outnumbers/normally higher tiered. Hopefully we'll at least get the alliance system within a year from now... I feel like it's been forever... Really looking forward to doing WvW with my guildies since we're mostly all on different servers
---
&gt;Not nearly enough hits on holosmith.
---
Massive waves of nerfs are bad game design. Specific traits / abilities should be buffed or nerfed lightly and often. This prevents roller coaster balance where classes are either OP or worthless.
---
Are minions just zombie skritt?
---
Nice Zuko piece :p
---
This is great, and I'd gild the creator for their time, if I could afford it. Although I'm happy that it helps others, this doesn't solve my main issue, which is that there's currently no way to copy +paste gear templates. As far as I'm aware, there's an option to copy your gear configuration in gw2 build templates, but pasting it externally results in an empty [] link. To my knowledge you can paste them between in game gear templates, but when you only have the standard 2 then it's not really helpful. 
---
I don't know if that's yet another bug with Anet's templates, or whether it was an intentional 'feature' to force users to pay. If it was intentional then they can get fucked, because at this point I'd rather completely minimise my investment into this game than monetarily compensate them for this entire fuck up. Which is sad, because I've devoted almost 7 years to this game :/
---
[removed]
---
that rampage nerf seems pretty hard. won't it be like a wet noodle going from 1.2 -&gt; 0.01 power coefficient?
---
I'd love to see how these mirage nerfs go though. they really did have it all with mirage cloak having so many advantages tied to it and it felt really unfun to play against when everything they do is "the big burst" and then you just run out of skills/endurance to deal with it
---
the pbaoe nerf to holographic shockwave done in a previous patch was a step in the right direction. that skill was incredibly good and gave holos way too much cc. 600-300 feels a lot more fair to play against, but the class itself can still be a nuisance to play against. their staying power both in team fights and roaming is similar to what thieves have in the amount of disengages they have access to. couple that with their numerous combo finishers and blasters in their many water fields and they can easily go from &lt;25% back to &gt;80% very quickly and there's little you can do about it. I'd like to see them continue to be the bruiser classes that are a force to be reckoned with, but a tune down of their ability to escape and burst healing would be nice as well.
---
Sorry you are struggling but i play all stories on zerker thief or vipers necro and have no problems
---
Dunno man. I have soloed every story line in Marauders or Zerker with only a few problem instances. Even those once I figured out the dynamic I did em. I don't sweat my rotation but rather play the instance as presented.
---
Same, need it on my mesmer would be awesome.
---
What? Come on man the PoF storyline is super easy...
---
Yeah so this patch is some quick nerfs to stuff thats overtuned atm, with the plan being to reduce TTK over the next couple of balance patches, starting with the one early next year.
---
&gt; - randomly posts 4 year old fluff video without context nor current relevance
---
&gt; - complains about "random" downvotes
---
*ok then*
---
👀
---
The fact that they're giving those out at Quiznos where Toasted Tastes Better (tm) probably means that Primordus is gonna be involved in the Icebrood Saga.
---
&gt;...a regular player in zerkers.. and I'm a good player, I've been legend rank in pvp ...
---
Doubt. 
---
Its been awhile since I did the story mission but what you are describing sounds like made up BS on your part. I dont know what class you are playing or what mission you are struggling with but its legit doable with a full zerk setup for "good" players. Maybe you are just missing what the mission objective is and are letting yourself get bogged down by endless adds, hard to tell from your post tho.
---
These changes are actually very big.
---
Holo became extremely oppressive because of Elixir U being changed to give stability. Before, you had to be a lot more strategic about corona use in order to get stability. This will become far more important post-patch, same with the quickness uptime.
---
A lot of the issues with holo stem from the massive quickness uptime, and with reduced access to it (and elixir U as a stunbreak being far more important due to reduced stab uptime) holo can't play nearly as aggressively.
---
You'll find after the patch that only good holos for the most part will be still hard to kill, the rest should be fairly easy with poor stab timing (not using corona effectively) and being too greedy with damage.
---
Hey speak for yourself the hardest thing in the game is surviving talking to NPCs pressing F is dangerous in Soldiers gear man. I am being sarcastic of course.
---
Its not though,. I have 11k HP in zerks as a guardian and playing regularly. Duel me in pvp if you don't  believe I'm skilled. Pve has nothing to do with mechanical awareness but how much buffs you can stack or how OP you are. I can dodge the main mechanics all day or try to aoe as much as humanly possible but nothing compares to the shit it throws at you a lot of the time you get downed no matter what.
---
I'm not saying the missions are impossible but getting downed for shit that's OUT OF MY CONTROL is extremely fucking frustrating.
---
Guess i'll be "that guy" here.
---
I know you mean well making a useful program that will help those that want "more" than 24 build templates.
---
But now? You fuckin' with anet's money. And if any mob movie is an indicator of what not to do, is to never fuck with another individuals money
---
You release this during what i would consider to be Anet's most vulnerable time, in which they are making their new features live, and has to go through a tribulation as it gets integrated properly, and this program kind of spits in their face while anet's down on the ground, wouldn't you agree? 
---
Now if you spit on al Capone's face and then start selling drugs and on his turf after he's been raided by police what do you suppose is going to happen to you?
---
??? 
---
Staff 4 gives chaos aura (same with leaps through staff 5 - staff 2!!) and chaos aura is incredibly strong, putting out weakness, confusion and cripple as possible conditions. Two of which, cripple and weakness are cover conditions for your confusion and torment. Cover conditions are crazy strong, and mesmer can apply them often. So yeah, staff is still very good and if you think other wise you're very wrong my friend.
---
I legit have nothing to say to this beyond baiting a reaction out of you... Either use your skills to beat that mean AI that has maybe 3 attacks or stick to what you are good at and get pvp legend on a new account or something I dunno Im not the boss of you.
---
I've played through the HoT story about 20 times, on differrent classes, including off them. Many of those I've soloed. If you're having a problem, you're not as good  a player as you think you are.
---
Open world is far more important than zerg v. zerg. Honestly, step 1 to balancing competitive play is making sure team sizes are the same. Oops. Step 2 is to design maps that have exactly the correct amount of choke/entry points for the intended gameplay and exact number of players. Double Oops.
---
WvWvW players want safe tiger hunting. It's a fundamental oxymoron.
---
For all the criticism we give this game engine, it does large scale combat really well. When it becomes time to put Guild Wars 2 to bed, I hope ArenaNet or NCSOFT sell or re-use the intellectual property behind how they solved handled large scale battles. WvW still performs well compared to other large scale PvP modes in other MMOs (Cyrodil in ESO, WarPlots in Wildstar)
---
Necro in general doesn't really work well roaming. That has more to do with the classes general lack of mobility. I think your issue ultimately comes down to the fact you find the need to cast the shade in order to be effective. I'd be willing to bet that's because the necro has little else that is effective at the 900+ range. 
---
Would you agree that if your weapon skills could appropriately fill the ranged gap, there would be little need to cast ranged shades? And the times you do there should be an appropriate consequence for doing so? 
---
I'd probably grant that maintaining the 100% CD increase on sand savant is no longer necessary, but that might be revisited down the road. This strikes me as a minimalistic patch to address pain points (which they do say outright) so they can add more work time to a fairly large comprehensive one a couple of months from now.
---
Sounds like all it will take is a condi thief with a shortbow to destroy you.
---
AoEs AND CCs. Whatever would you do!? It's like PoF all over again!
---
git gud boi
---
If you want me to not dismiss you leave the hyperbole at the door. I don't give a fuck whether you think I'm a white knight or not. I upvoe plenty of complaint threads, including complaints about build templates.
---
But that doesn't mean that hyberbole makes for good arguments, or that you can ignore anything good done because it's not the content you play. It really is that simple.
---
Actually, pretty much everyone who got banned was later unbanned. I only know about 4 or 5 people who were banned but all of their bans were lifted, so either Anet changed their minds or was mistaken about those accounts being accessed.
---
Until we have wardrobe templates it's a fast way to change outfit.
---
Well, unequipping everything is a hassle regardless, and when don't you have a full inventory during halloween? It's mad inventoryween.
---
Laughs in ele
---
Well to be fair the game has a very mediocre take on its business model. It is very sad considering how good some of its features are. Anet had the ressources to reshape parts of its engine(tho not particularily needed) but to also gives more meaning to gameplay.
---
The economy of this game is extremly sad, very p2w. When people say rightfully that minimum wage jobs are better farming than actual farming, something's definitely wrong :D.
---
&gt; ...a regular player in zerkers.. and I'm a good player, I've been legend rank in pvp ...
---
Who would have known - playing PvP isn't teaching PvE.
---
New spec confirmed - Keyboard Warrior.
---
It isn't the best at roaming but Reaper however is an decent enough class to roam on. 
---
Scourge was designed to play around it's shade, when you take that mechanic away you're somewhat gimping one of it's core design philosophies. Any modification to weapon skills will affect all 3 of necromancer's specializations not just scourge since it's only unique weapon is the torch, which works fairly well.
---
The 100% increase should be removed, I agree with you.
---
Lets compare to the same era elite specializations
---
Is a warrior punished for timing out / proccing full counter? No
---
Is the Mirage punished for not using their ambush attack after dodging? No
---
And that's the thing I'm trying to get at, Scourge gains defense (damage reduction) and offense (concentration, expertise) when summoning a shade, there shouldn't be a design that actively punishes classes for using their abilities, with no way of quickly cancelling the summoned shade so that you can "toggle" between range and meele mode.
---
What you failed to mention it’s a 1/3 roll making it extremely unreliable, unless you’re all about the RNG Gods. But hey, wanna keep living in your buble, who am I to stop you. Enjoy your utility mate.
---
One was server side, one wasn’t.
---
You sound like an idiot
---
You are playing the class with the most powerful burst in the game but you're whinning about story mode L O L.
---
Guardian also has a shit ton of utility skills like self Quickness,deflect,condition negation,mobility and even Aegis.
---
Seriously, just git gud and stop whining cuz you are dying to trash mobs lmao
---
The philosophy of this game has always been to kill shit as fast as possible before they can touch you, if you can't do that, you aren't that good and you just got you ass carried in Raids.
---
You're saying that you're Dungeon Master like it's hard to achieve, everyone and their mother has this title so it's doesn't mean shit.
---

---
I only wish you could bind an equipment set to your build template or vise-versa and tag a "set active" play mode to them.  Not fun jumping into WvW and having to manually switch both build/equipment then later jump back into a PvE champ boss fight, only to discover you're still on your "active" WvW build/equipment set.
---
Yeah, so just having a "set active play mode" tag to the templates would go a long way.
---
this be awesome, great job
---
You sound like such a whiney little cunt after reading this and all your replies.

Daed gaem is dead.

You know I wouldn't say an mmo means a community working towards a common goal and that just means that not only mmos but the whole world is perceived by an individual and not the same for everyone, what I want to say is that because you and some other people are bothered by the fact that arenanet put templates into the game doesn't mean the rest of the player base thinks that way.
---
As a person who never used arc templates bcs I was too lazy to set it up I would change the ~4 builds I have per character manually and I never thought much about it till templates were released and my life was made much easier and now I have much more inventory space which is a big bonus since I never bought any bag expansion slots.
---
Whenever I see one of these posts or any other similar ones bashing arenanet and saying how they failed their most invested player base when and by that I mean the people who consider themselves dedicated, invested w/e...(raiders mainly) are all being very subjective on the matter when the fact is that you being a raider or having a lot of builds doesn't make you an invested player and nobody can claim to be that since you are rating yourself which is again subjective.
---
What that same population doesn't understand is that the population of players that is raging about this is maybe 2% of the player base if not less and I personally didn't even care to get onto the conversation until I saw 1 billion posts made by the same group of people commenting on each others posts and looking for the rest of their small party of people sharing the same opinion and spending hours and hours on reddit being angry about the new templates.
---
What I wanted to say with this long post is that not everyone shares your opinion that templates are bad and evil and you lashing out your anger on arena net 24/7 will not change anything bcs you think they did a bad thing.
---
That settles it then. When I logged in yesterday to claim the fee stuff I thought it isn't so bad as people on reddit make it but it really is worse than that. No auto change for pvp pretty much destroys the game for me. I will never be able to remember to activate my pvp build before the end of the countdown. And then one build slot is reserved for pvp all the time making it two I have. Where to put the other 5 builds for each character?
---
Warning memories incoming: in gw1 you could store lots and lots of build templates. Back in those days, ANet was not as greedy as they are now. Everyone has to make a living but that's just over the top greediness we have here. It were not half as bad if we would get separate build templates for each game mode.
---
Yeah, official stuff should be held to a higher standard
---
You ever wonder if game companies look at each other's mistakes and think "I wonder how we can top that?"
---
Fallout 76 made this a weird year
---
It's mine !!^^
---
I was a mesmer main since launch and active all the time (still am).  
---
A little over 2 months ago i re-leveled a new thief and that's my main now, couldn't be happier.
---
At this point, mesmer (in every game mode) feels clunky and difficult without feeling rewarding for pulling stuff off. For example, to me, it feels like there is never a good time to put down wells. Someone or something always moves and it never catches everyone. Now compare that to what the renegade can do with alacrity and i feel like an idiot for even trying to be a chrono.
---
Also, I kinda hated mirage since day 1. The dodge and damage mechanic (just like the wells) feels horrible to me. While the daredevil evades are far superior to the normal ones in every way possible.
---
This game is dead to me already. when mike left nothing is gonna stop ncsoft from milking this game dry and i dont see gw2 recovering from what happened this year after season 5 i think its gg for gw2 and anet.
---
But it's *not* part of Windows if you need to install it...
---
Almost nothing Anet does hit the mark? What? Have you people completely forgotten the Bad by Blood release? The new map and the variety of things to do therewas received generally well, but people have completely forgotten about that in their rage?
---
Elementalist - Heal Skill - I think it’s called Ether Renewal.
---
It should be the same animation as Guardian staff Empower I think. If you move you will start walking though. Or at least it is the same animation as Guardian Elite - Renewed Focus (I think that’s it, the one that makes you invulnerable). Daredevil heal skill also uses this animation, but is very short.
---
Herald - Glint Elite Skill causes you to float for a second to blast enemies in front of you.
---
Bold of you to be such an optimist.
---
eAnet should offer you a job
---
Shhh, don't disturb the circlejerk.
---
That's not true in the slightest. The only spec that can dodge rampage reliably is mirage. And it would take like at least 3-4 evades + a few detargetting to make sure you came out of the rampage duration standing and not with like 10% hp. Good luck with the rest 99% of other specs against rampage. 
---
That skill is pure OP garbage and the nerf is long overdue.
---
Yeah, but open world updates "aren't content", remember? "Two hours of content every three months" and such.
---
Does Anet pay you to be so naive? Pull your head out of the sand dude.
---
it doesnt though? rampage is still the elite to use even after being nerfed, all other warrior elites are trash
---
Im new, what is point 16 you're talking about?
---
That makes sense ! Yes the best thing you can do is vote with your wallet. Not judging you at all for spending your own money either. Just was interested in why.
---
So keep it in WvW and split it. It's not that hard to learn new functionality.
---
all those comments about willing to pay for build templates didnt help either
---
Noticed that as well. Having to manually show/hide stuff with every switch becomes old fast. Hopefully that's not a technical limitation and just an oversight.
---
That's odd. I thought it was their unwillingness to communicate with the playerbase and their constant desire to cater to casual players that are barely invested in the game.
---
For now that_shaman already put out they actually build for 10 slots. That is another 3.6k gems.
---
Mesmer still is, and always will be good. Players get used to a single brain dead meta class, and when that build inevitably gets nerfed they can't adapt whatsoever.
---
that's a good idea. I would give him a gold, just to see if it works. 2 for a /rockout.
---
Very nice. Love how you went into detail on the sylvari glow!
---
What better options? If there were better options, people would have bailed long ago. Instead, they're just sitting and raging at everything because there are so few options. WoW? It's WoW. FF? It's mostly just instanced content over a WoW veneer. Archeage? It's an old game.  
---
 If you like RvR, there's nowhere to go.  
---
But it's getting tiring to see nonstop bitching. I'd take the anger over templates more seriously if the same damn people weren't winding themselves up over the non-event of the supposed mass bannings over arc templates that wasn't one at all, but as usual the subreddit wound itself into a rage before it was pointed out that people were, ONCE AGAIN, lying about why they were banned (account sharing to get ahead in PVP, not templates) and that even some of the accusers ADMITTED they were account sharing but then whined they shouldn't be banned. Stop fucking brigading over this shit!
---
Unlocking a tab shouid be 50 gems tops.  its a fucking tab.
---
Very lil of the player base use the forums or reddit it the vocal few making a big deal of all this nothing will change so dont hold your breath
---
The servers the game has been on Since PoF have been complete dogshit for a while. First signs of server problems were when people started disconnecting and having rollbacks up to 30 mins even.  This progressed towards the trading post not responding as fast in terms of buying or selling items (now even worse with it taking forever in order to even interact with the gemstore).
---
The problem with the servers the game is on now, is that these servers from Amazon use their own hardware, so they don't have the specs of the server like if it runs on SSD, or how many cores the CPU has or anything of that nature.  As far as we know they went with the cheapest option to save a buck, but lack CPU power to handle all these requests from character skills being used in WvW, to simple trading post transactions, now to build templates which clearly threw up a red flag to ANet finally to fix their fucking servers.
---
Me pls
---
They should just cap the amount of targets to 1 + 1 per small shade, or 2 + 2 for big shade.
---
I see no problem with killing a Scourges AoE in WvW. That gamemode is gonna be non existent in a year anyway.
---
WvW players have consistently complained for *years* over the same issues. We're not asking for anything new at this point. We're just asking for SOMETHING.  
---
I say this as someone who doesn't like the negative tone in general, however.
---
I agree with you. Staff is where the good separate from the bad. It doesn't have much overwhelming abilities in theory, but they are very strong if used in the right hands / with some sort of macro thinking in mind. I don't even think that the chaos storm change was a nerf at all - now the AoE daze is super reliable. Also staff skill 2 - simple yet strong.
---
Also i'm not sure at what level this build becomes possible because ppl whi run map completions often use tomes of knoledge or over tricks to be lvl 80, so their run gets faster.
---
&gt; and again this overexaggerating BS from you.
---
Not going to lie.. the servers do seem way worse since build templates were added.. trading post / gemstore is less responsive, I see way more disconnects and other network problems within the game since.  They need to get off these Amazon servers and onto something more concrete with actual specs.  Amazon doesn't release the hardware specs for AWS which is a huge deal breaker imo.. but anet wanted to save money ......
---
wait no more 2 shot 3 kill warrior? 
---
meh. i just start playing warrior :D
---
When they released the new fractal instabilities, if you had slippery slope on Cliffside you literally could not walk up the slope after killing the first pack of mobs.  
---
That's a QA team of 0, not 100.
---
How much do you say its a good amount to tip?
---
There should be no problems, but you can back up the categories.json file to be safe
---
Step 1: delete gold to gem conversion from the game
---
Step 2: have reasonal prices
---
It can't go any other way around.
---
Will it work with d912pxy?
---
Probably never a good time to say this in this sub but..
---
Hey wow classic is pretty fun! Just saying :D
---
In term of immersion it’s so so much better than gw2 lol
---
It's not misinformation, the engine is terribly optimized this is fact. Your system is what I was talking about when I said some people can run constant or higher 60 fps. Your system isn't mid range like the op. Lol
---
Chalice of tears, once you know the way.
---
Best part is gw1 had a totally free and robust build template system.
---
Looking at number of players in raids and wvw, I would be not so hasty about what gamemode will be non existent next year. Way lower population of raids does not really justify the resources spent there...
---
Server Costs™
---
Bring me back to some old school F2P v. Sub gaming days...
---
What about the 1K ecto that it cost? is that free?
---
Yes, but that wouldn't sound as good as 1000g
---
take your weak ass brain and small dick tactics and shove it up your ass
---
sad because memser can't autotattack outside point and win anymore? bet you main ranger
---
You start with 1k ectos and end with 1k ectos.. How is that any gain ?
---
WvW tournament was amazing a few years back.
---
Was suppossed to be a yearly thing but never happened again.
---
You start with 1k and end with 1k so it +-0? So basically yes.
---
Would appreciate each setting individually instead of character-wide.
---
For each set, just remember the setting so we only need to set once.
---
Ex: Loadout#1 is a Power set. Hence, spiky armor whatever. Loadout#2 is a Condi set, and I would like it to go with an outfit with saved dye, if possible.
---
A skin loadout would be a bonus. (I don't mind at the cost of 6 trans charge if it's an overwrite)
---
I don't have anything against splitting the template buys to 3 categories. After all, you can ignore 2 of them and use chat codes instead. It is only inventory templates what matters, and you can save up huge aount of gems that way.
---
You can ignore 2 of them and jsut use chat codes...those build template slots are just pure convenience item, but not having them doesn't block you from unlimited use of the feature in any way.
---
The game has been focused on the living world for a long long time. This isn't a shock to anyone and shouldn't be.  That's been the focus. Anet hasn't really tried to hide it.  Anyone paying attention has known it, for years now. 
---
I agree. I think other areas of the game should get more attention. I think WvW in particular needs more attention, more than anything else.
---
But I also have a strong feeling that more people play Living World Open World content than people that raid or SPvP.  Anet isn't focusing on the living world in a vacuum. They know how many people are playing that content and it's probably a bigger percentage of the playerbase than other content. Doesn't mean that other content should be ignored.
---
But saying that what Anet is focusing on being done well is meaningless isn't really an answer. It's what the game has become and some people DO focus on that and do like it, even if it's not what you like. So you what? Want to dismiss all those players and the stuff that's done because it's not your stuff.
---
I guarantee you for a decent percentage of the playerbase, they don't really PvP or WvW or raid. They just play open world stuff. And for those people good stuff is happening, even if it's not perfect.  Even if you didn't like the achievements in one zone.
---
I don't judge zones on the achievements. I judge them on the sense of wonder I get from playing them and the fun I have playing them.
---
I spent a pretty long time messing around in Thunderhead Peaks. I spent a lot of time in Dragonfall.
---
Unfortunately my time in Grothmar was so far cut short due to major surgery, but when I heal up a bit, I'll be back to playing more there as well. I enjoyed what I did play of it a lot. 
---
It may not be your content, but you can't remove it from the equation when it is the content of so many people, and I guarantee you that's the case.
---
This is true... the only things of true value are the skins you must earn to unlock.
---
WvW/pvp tendril armors and legendary backpacks come to mind..
---
Pretty much nothing from the gemstore has any value outside fashion wars and nothing is exclusive so nothing (except champ gizmo from the mAT has any true value from earning it)
---
Maybe that’s why fanboys never see anything wrong, they live in the past where the game was still standing on it’s own 2 feet
---
Thanks! Not sure why I'm getting downvoted for asking an honest question, but kudos to you on delivering a great answer. It really does sound pretty stupid, that's definitely not templating.
---
Makes sense to me. I see how it was easily missed. Seems like a pretty reasonable request though.
---
PvP is going to get own verison of templates so the problem there is just temporary. Hopefully.
---
Capitalism
---
Open world in core Tyria maps is retarded easy and you can play whatever you want
---
It doesn't matter because the second you unlock Daredevil you are going to be using staff most of the time. Staff is thief's best overall weapon
---
&gt; The templates aren't templates, they're loadouts. You "save" a template, but any changes you make to it are automatically saved. 
---
Oh dear. I'm in the "has no need for templates and the system should work well for me" casual camp but even I will switch utilities some time. To quote the Rata Sum kid, that's incredibly stupid.
---
i know right. Check out our digital work!
---
[https://zap-magazine.com/](https://zap-magazine.com/)
---
There were already jokes about Anet banning everyone who had Notepad and Gw2 processes running at the same time.
---
There you go  
---
Fixed the Youtube title to "How to get to 1,000g" because people are too nitpicking LMAO
---
I'm trying not to feel too down about things, but somehow to me, the atmosphere in the game, on Reddit, and the forums all seem different. Something's changed in a way I'm not familiar with. There's a negativity in guilds I'm in, where hitherto they've been positive and optimistic. 
---
Going back to the competitive modes, I was really hopeful they'd at least leave PvP alone, because it uses such a radically different gear system, it seemed to me to be easiest just to leave that entirely alone.
---
When someone pointed out that this was not the case, there was then the realisation that the three "free" builds we were given, weren't free builds but the existing three builds repackaged. 
---
It does also explain why we get just two equipment builds and not three: PvP uses a different gear system, so we get one each for "free" for WvW and PvE. 
---
So implicitly, ANet thinks we only need 1 equipment set each for PvE and WvW. It is like they don't follow what people do in the game, or understand the vast build variety that exists for each class. (And when I say that, I'm not referring to just changing one trait here or there for different variations of "support boon chrono," I'm talking about large changes to both gear and traitlines to enable a class to change role and function.)
---
Yeah... This whole build template thing has left me feeling pretty sad about the game. The gross monetisation is one thing, and there are ways they could monetise the system in a way which was less gross.  But what I can't get over are the thought processes which lead to this technical implementation. It is close to unusable for me. I'm pretty sad about an update I was previously super hyped for.
---
literally every point you made, has already been brought up here.
---
Yeah, I don't know why you were getting downvoted either, just Reddit things! If you appear on the subreddit from time to time, you've likely missed most of the discussion and would be genuinely confused or out of the loop. 
---
Glad I could be of some use!
---
if only you could LOSE LOS,BLOCK,BLIND,DODGE,EVADE OR USE INVIS!
---
&gt; if only you could LOSE LOS,BLOCK,BLIND,DODGE,EVADE OR USE INVIS!
---
How is the population of both calculated though? If WvW counts the people that are only there for 5-10 minutes for their dailies then it's obviously higher. I don't raid everyday, but I do jump in WvW for 1 or 2 free dailies. If people like me are counted towards the WvW population you end up with way more.
---
It is really stupid. I cannot fathom the thought process which lead to this being a good idea. 
---
It just means that everyone I load up a "template" I have to still check everything in case I made an edit last time to suit a particular situation. Which defeats the point of a templating system; I may as well do it manually anyway (which actually I have been doing on my chrono).
---
Jesus dude, this puts the whole monetisation spin on it's head for me. I never actually considered the idea of mental health and monetisation in that sense. I mean, obviously I know addiction is a big thing, and people who gamble for the rush, regardless of if they can actually afford it or not (I had a minor addiction in a previous game in this way) are their own worst enemies, but with the whole idea of baiting people into buying things in case it "never comes back and you'll never have that shiny thing again", and that really affecting people with high levels of anxiety that they aren't able to easily control, really makes my skin crawl. 
---
I know that companies like EAnet need to make money, they need to pay their employees who actually craft the games we enjoy, and I'm not going to pretend to have the answers to how they can fairly monetise this game, but there HAS to be a better way. 
---
I remember once upon a time, GW2 was celebrated for their cash shop being very fair, and a lot of it comes down to the fact that they couldn't just sell upgrade components, because of the horizontal nature of the game.
---
Now this is quality necromancing
---
These are all band aid fixes, something needs to be done about the overall blob meta, absolute lack of useful utility on many classes/specs, and weakly defined combat roles in general.   
---
However since that would basically entail throwing everything away and re-building from scratch, we all know that's never going to happen.
---
And no bulk discounts if you want to buy multiples! :D
---
Yes, you should definitely try again.
---
Hello art, i've missed you!
---
Yea there is build template feature with 3 levels of monetization now. And it do not serve purpose of build templates since it was so aggressively monetized.
---
Yes it is strong. But they nerfed it absolutely to the ground. It will only got like a wet noodle now. I'm playing warrior in wvw and never use it. If I fight a warrior using it I just kite. Ain't that difficult. You get punished for not seeing that rampage is on. But now it's absolutely not worth using it, and I liked the diversity in warrior elites (in wvw). And I just hope we don't get this ridiculous nerf in wvw as well. Elite skills are meant to be elite.
---
Well, it is called bad management. Do not defend them. If studios like DE and GGG able to pump content over the years without crunch it is possible for everyone.
---
Cant see why it doesnt as arcdps chainloads proxy.  I think this works like the mechanics log and scrolling text addon that loads with arc
---
Yea it's absolutely stupid. Could have removed the skill or replace it.
---
I'm so using this at my own risk, seriously.
---
I dont like popcorn. But for just this occasion some ben en jerrys?
---
No it is cow race. Horns.
---
Quaggan and Kodan tonics are the worst things they put into the game.
---
imagine if gw2 goes open source - how much it would improve in half a year.
---
Likely because of adobe’s pricing and subscription model. Made the switch myself to Affinity.
---
I'm still a bit sad everytime I'm reminded that trolls end doesn't exist anymore. It wasn't a particularly challenging JP, but I always enjoyed it.
---
Ranger's life for meee~~
---
Do you have to show up naked?
---
There is an unwritten rule in our guild: do not play on patch day, do not play for couple of days on major patch day. 
---
I guess, several weeks for templates patch now.
---
Being able to play with and alongside some nice people from around the world, co-op with others, or duel against each-other in pvp areas is what i call a meaningful reward from gw2, oh wait...
---
You mean pixels, never-mind.
---
You forget the janitor occasionally testing if the game works after patching
---
&gt;There are some salty people in this thread bashing people who are overworked and having a seriously shitty week, let's shed some insight shall we?
---
That's hardly our fault now, is it?
---
I fail to see a problem in bashing people for releasing a shitty product. You don't wanna get bashed? Don't do that. It's called "feedback". It works just like praising them for doing good work, only it discourages the behaviour in question instead of rewarding it. And, all things considered, I strongly feel the particular behaviour in question should be discouraged as much as possible.
---
Sure, on the technical side of things you're right. Code is never perfect and bugs get released, it's inevitable. But that's not why they get bashed. If the feature was actually well designed and fairly priced, people would joke about the bugs, laugh about it and buy the product. It's not the bugs that make this product shitty, they're just another reason to point out how unhappy we are with what we get offered.
---
Heal scourge is the biggest meme with transfusion, what is downstate?
---
I'd say female human or sylvari, asuras are rather standing on their staves
---
Company's keep pushing as much they can until the players do something. 
---
Some company's even keep pushing afther that. 
---
If they look at each other it's how they can make more money
---
Not how players react they don't seems to really care probably because of it being a other playerbase. 
---
Even though Anet keeps saying we are so important but i don't really see it since a long long time it sounds more like just something to say to make us feel important nothing more.
---
People can say Anet asks us what they want. 
---
Well they rarely put it in the game or if they do it with heavy Monitazation like now is the case.
---
It is very noticable Anet has been pushing more and more monitazation each year this is how they also make gold to gems for  more people too expensive so if they really want it they have to spend real money. 
---
At the start it was said Anet does not manipulate the gold to gems but they are manipulating it just in a other way.
---
Looks great, keep up the good work!
---
You know I wanted some nerfs to rampage...but that nerf LMAO literally nuked harder than any balance patch I've seen. Who knows maybe they'll revert it later on... or not.
---
&gt; You can only do so much with testing internally.
---
And they did less.
---
Benefit of the doubt isn't good enough to excuse the nonsense arising with all this. It didn't for plenty of past issues, it won't here. Given time, we'll move on like we always do, which makes it all the more important we don't sugarcoat the incompetence here.
---
The fact you get so many upvotes for something so idiotic, I think in fact these game companies are quite collegial and supporting of each other. Game devs live in a market of turbulence and sooner or later will swap turf and work with a lot of others in the industry. Companies going through lay offs, bad patches, good times, I think they're actually quite supportive and empathic about each other in these situations.
---
And gamers, like yourself and all your upvoters, just try to add fuel to the fire and start a new meme to ridicule or stomp them further into the dirt.
---
Go ahead, downvote me, but fuck me, this community is really raring its ugly head these days. Despite hiding it behind poor sarcasm.
---
Don't get me wrong, I don't think the build template system is anywhere near good enough, but I won't stoop to this level either.
---
And then you remember that a Single coder made a better version that was much more stable and free, in way less time with no bugs at all.
---
RIP arc build templates.
---
only the cool kids get invited to his annual resurrection parties
---
Pretty sure everyone gets the achievement even if they didn't contribute at all, I got it on my alt that did nothing
---
Agreed, No xpac literally means they can't make one that returns enough profit to warrant the dev.
---
Interestingly, red text on white background is how Belgian license plates are colored
---
We should have realised what was going to happen with them monetising systems like this when they said "expansion content would be coming with living world". We just didn't realise it would cost 10 times the amount of an expansion to purchase all of the minor QoL features of build template for 9 characters.
---
Well at the very least you did something instead of just bitching about it endlessly, that's something.
---
Nice clickbait!
---
I would assume that the whole point of devs made this stuff easy to export in such a universal fashion to help mitigate even if only a tiny amount, the absolute shit storm that would come.
---
I'm just giving the man some advise, no need to be rude about it, mate.
---
Boom corrupt isnt high value in pve. Neither is a 0.5s delay. Same for condi clear.
---
If you want scourge as competitive dps then it cannot be as tanky, utility focused and easy. Yet that's what you keep demanding.
---
As I said to Lickinturds I am aware of the differences of the native and third party systems
---
This is a huge step to changing the blob meta considering they only address 2 skills.
---
"Underpowered elite specs" dont you dare go suggest they buff other specs and yada yada.
---
Just want to add that when you level make sure to learn all your weapons.This game don't have a one set to go only it all depends on what game mode you play and if you are in instance or not. Whilst being in the open world you play what ever works for you in PvP, WvW, Fractals, Raids and so on you will have to go for what works best for what you are set to do. 
---
Learning the core weapons whilst you level give you advantage when reaching end game since you then don't have to learn all weapons that you never tried up to then, and you have the advantage to know the core weapons already.
---
You know your software encountering.
---
Lol, im not saying buff to the point of broken. Im suggesting that why have 2 elite specs for certain classes that barely anyone use in wvw because its Simply not even on par with its counter part and even core.
---
I just want variation and being viable and dont feel like handicapped because you like the concept of said spec.
---
Im not saying break the specs by adding stupid buff. Just rework certain traits essentially.
---
https://gw2efficiency.com will give you lots of stats and also other very useful things around your account. Imo every GW2 player should use this tool.
---
So is balancing for open world. Openworld players dont want balance or challenges, they want trivial gameplay where they face roll random mobs.
---
People are *way* too angry/worked up these days to see that as a joke, not with how many people are being totally dismissive of those complaining.
---
And hes already less retarded than the last 2 years of scourge changes where they failed to balance anything, but managed to make pve players cry about every change regardless.
---
It's been like that for a few years already. But they're sure to double down on it this year.
---
i'm not on anet's team dude so i have no reason to blindly support them! i'm just a costumer voicing my opinion on stuff
---
and no, i'm not one of those "well if you have nothing nice to say then don't say anything at all" either! btw you're super white knighting, cut the crap
---
are you actually expecting people to shut up in their concerns and pretend it's fine? should we outright fucking lie to new players and trick them for this vague concept of "it's good for the game"?
---
actually disgusting feel-good nonsense post
---
Why yes, game developers work hard to make their games bad on purpose to annoy the /#gamers. Gotta rake in that sweet middle income wage working 70 hour weeks.
---
They way I see complaints is that each complaint no matter how small, big, or ridiculous is a person that still cares.  When a person has a reaction (both positive and negative) it is still a feeling at its core.  It might not be the reaction that's looked for but still a reaction.  So taking a step back and looking at it a lot of people are pissed off and still care enough to say something.  What gets scary is when a shit system/news gets released and people don't scream.  What they do is just wash their hands and move on without a sound.
---
A few days ago i was hit by 14 k shield bash. That is the day when i got pissed of at the game and still am pissed about it because a shiled bash should not be able to hit with 14 k and yet it did.
---
Can my shocking aura please have 14 k hits after someone hits me with the shocking aura on. ok? please?
---
Actually scourge denies play, while boons enable it. Are both too powerful?
---
Yes and cmc identified that.
---
Should we tone down both at same time, yes. But if we have to tone down 1 before the other, it should be denial and not enablers.
---
Yeah, ive been studying revenant and renegade, and ive got those traits enable, i Try to proc kallas fervor as much as possible.
---
Running the torment damage increase trait and also bleeding.
---
My big question is it shows like i deal for example  on one of my wep skill :
---
Im running mace/axe + Shortbow (signature of renegade) 
---
Torment : 8.8k (overall), and 16k when target is moving.
---
Now i did some math, and even if it lasted its full cycle, the tick damage per sec doesnt add up tk the tooltip. Un less this tooltip is considering full kallas fervor enabled.
---
You seem to know about renegade but What numbers is considered "decent" per tick on condis like bleeding and torment?
---
The other condi ive used on my other classes have been stuff like poison that easily reach 1-3k per tick. Burning that also reach that, so im not sure if im doing something wrong.
---
The world will also get all the random players who are not in a guild or in the alliance and the alliance have no say of if they want to have them or not they will be there just as they are today and do their own thing. So litterally nothing change.
---
I deleted the game to play the outer worlds and planned to come back when the next living world update releases. Reading this sub makes me want to quit the game forever. Anet is not able to do things right.
---
/watch?v=NUc4KI1_mGU
---
Don't let other people's opinions lessen your entertainment. Just play the game as long as you have fun.
---
Let us all take a moment to remember when they stated having done a LOT of QA on the livestream they made about templates.
---
They even said Revenants got extra QA!!! First template bugs I hear about post launch : Revs...
---
Not to mention the mounts have litterally hundreds of bugs and none of them have been fixes. Oh wait one was actaully fixed this patch allthough not mentioned you can again take supplies/gather/talktonpc and unmount at the same time.
---
for raids either healtempest(budget druid) or scourge(for afking the encounter)
---
for fractals you should play with people that have functional keyboards and as such do not require heals
---
with bads that need healing in a mode that has no passive boss aura, renegade is the correct choice(healbrand is trash but pugs love it)
---
How is this not banned by EAnet already xD?
---
Supported... aaand the same for outfits, pretty please. And save the dyes for each. \*sigh\*
---
[That's not how Jesus Christ looks like](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/crgi74/you_did_it_reddit/).
---
Yes they could. The moment they announced paid mods I realized it was probably a good time to lose all faith. Their games are notoriously buggy to the point where half the fun is finding those bugs. Anyone expect FO76 to be exempt from that...
---
It's wild just how bad and consistently they are still making headlines over how bad it is though.
---
For some reason I just had some flashbacks of GW1 rank emote. Best e-pen ever haha
---
Yeah, that is What bothers me thought, i understand that its imposible for all specs to have balance.
---
But it would be great if at least between different elite specs, they actually change the playstyle so while it might not be on par with its counter part at least it brings something use full to the table that the other dont,but i dont think renegade brings something usefull at all that herald cant.
---
It also doesnt help that i always Try to play stuff that barely anyone uses (regarding elite specs) and see how they perform, some of them are quite surprisingly good, but others feel like your playing the same with little to no difference between specs. 
---
Pd: Sorry if im not explaining myself clearly as spanish is my main language.
---
Oh boy, another synth lover &lt;3
---
They have *miles* and *miles* of improvement to come close to that 3rd party hack, and from the sound of the technical limitations corner they coded themselves into I do not believe getting on the same continent as Arc is possible.
---
I suppose that's the sad truth about this subreddit atm yeah
---
I do not believe build templates are that easy to adjust or make changes based on previous feedback, from my understanding they took months to develop. I do hope they implement some changes based on user feedback but I think it’s unfair of the community to think they will happen immediately. I am agree that the gem prices are high, so that’s something that could have been remedied immediately.
---
There is a lot of other factor that go into the per tick damage as well. Any vuln sources will increase it, might (obvioisly), as well as your sigils may cause the tooltip to not line up wirh the what actually happens.
---
You also have to consider your target too. Some classes have traits or skulls to reduce incoming condition damage, or foods, or buffs like light aura.
---
At 8.8k damage for the cycle for mace 3, assuming no duration modifiers you should be seeing something like 750 ticks. However, one of the downsides of condi revenant is that it can't burst its conditions like guard and their can. Revs take a while to ramp up their condition stacks, which get cleansed during that period. Which is probably the most likely reason youre seeing like 3k ticks from other classes.
---
1-2k ticks are ok imo with this build but it only works in a few ways: either eat a condi burst vs a condi build then legend transfer swap (pulsating pestilence) + herald mallyx f2 for 6 unique condi transfer burst  or kite and grind ur opponent down.
---
Yeah, a patch never caused problems in any game ever before. Completely new and unexpected situation.
---
I think you're both underestimating how much cost on a pure hardware and setup level costs to fully simulate a real environment, and overestimating how much resources they have available. I sincerely doubt they have the budget to spare when they had to let 100 people go earlier this year, and their marketing stuff or what have you being taken back over by NCSoft.
---
Even aside -all of that-, The amount and type of people that play on a test server will act and react completely different from how people will normally use it. Sure, having a public test server around will undoubtably cover some more scenarios than what they probably have now, but it's not going to cover all of them. And at that point you just gotta question whether it's worth the investment or not in the first place.
---
Well...they actually did it for the 2nd gen Legendary weapons and the Legendary armors, so...
---
I entirely disagree but fair enough
---
No, you just press a hotkey instead of having it done automatically.
---
I was fine with it. But I don't play wvw or pvp.  And I haven't bothered to make a new build yet either. Because I only really play with one character, and I'm stubborn when it comes to changing the build.   So overall, I just want them to make it easier to get through older content that requires other players join you, but aren't there anymore.  Because I only just started working on getting my legendary.   And the fractals are empty at lower levels.
---
1 month ago they retardedly tried to nerf scourge yet managed to buff it by increasing target cap on demand. Now they're removing scourge's ability to be a high dps, high corrupt, decent support melee + range AoE spec. 
---
They aren't reverting the change entirely - only the part where they managed to buff scourge.
---
You forgot to mention the fact they are actually trying to charge us for it too. That is what has me laughing my ass off the most.   
---
As a web developer(I know different field). If I shipped a site and it was completely broken. I would not be shocked if my client didn't pay for it or got super pissed.
---
thanks!
---
people still play this dead game lol?
---
it should be no surprise that the devs that have been incompetent for 7+ years are still incompetent
---
she definitely goes higher! thanks, i will test the races :)
---
Correct
---
I hope you manage to convince yourself your posts aren't the same thing
---
yeah cause i checked my account on other websites and there seems to be no1 on the account , no lost gold, sold mats, nothing new on AH but the authenticator is there for some reason ?
---
Yeah I really couldn't give a shit anymore this was 3 months ago.
---
I'm not sure that's a fair basis for comparison. TES Oblivion and Divinity 2 are very different games, but are both on Gamebryo, for example.
---
Awesome, so master minion from gw 1 confirmed for Gw2?
---
Sign me in lol.
---
Cool art thought, i love necro therefore i love this
---
i just made a female Asura Guardian and I had to delete her. It feels like her gait was bugged, and probably wasn't and it's the norm. She ran in an outright ridiculous manner, I would not be able to watch that when playing her. It was too ridiculous, she was like wobbling and the amount her feet moved did not correspond to the large distance she quickly covered, so the end effect was she was like wobbling and wiggling and kind of sliding on the ground and covering distance pretty fast.
---
thanks! I don't own PoF though, so I will be able to test only HoT elites then.
---
Happy cake day!
---
Unfortunately that's just kinda how the balance of the meta is atm. 
---
You could try woodenpotatoes sb/staff speed rune renegade build but forewarning its not an amazing build, its just fun to play. The biggest aspect of playing renegade in pvp is kiting ur opponent and grinding them down, not truly bursting them.
---
If u try out herald i would recommend swapping the sb for staff. Offers a 2s block (all sides) and a 2 Condi cleanse if u don't have transfer off CD.
---
I do think Condi rev is still fun regardless of its success rate but in terms of the meta sadly it can't be denied that power herald is better because it can burst so well, gap close, high evade uptime (riposting shadows on shiro + sword 3), boon rip and just general mobility.
---
That's just a lack of imagination.
---
thanks for this! I guess I should stick with human/norn/sylvari females then - their levitation/floating seems to be shared, am I right? Like the animation is identical for them and then only the males are different + Asura and Charr have a different animation, right?
---
:D
---
I think you're over-evaluating the number of GW2 fans/players who would have the skills and time (and time is important if you do not have a way to do that for a living without a full-time job to pay the bills) to jump in such a huge project and do a lot of stuff in the span of 6 months. And you're doing that by like a lot.
---
And you're also ignoring the part for which "making GW2 open-source" is far from an easy task, that you have a bunch of pipelines to take into account and not just a big blob.
---
thanks! female norn don't share the same levitation animations with female sylvaris and humans?
---
"Ready to support this out of sheer spite" is the reason anet keeps fucking up this badly. 
---
Everything anet does gets whiteknighted. You didn't even argue on merit, you were ready to support changes out of spite against people that criticised them... You do exactly what anet does. Pretend criticism is in no way valid and push things through just to spite people that dare voice concerns. 
---
Until you realise anet continues to ignore all feedback, and things only get worse. Still not realising it'll only antagonise other people more.
---
Please keep up supporting dumb decisions "out of spite" until it's so blatantly obviously bad that you can't. It's exactly what gw2 needs!
---
It will.
---
If I'm coming across that way then my bad but it's not what i'm trying to say at all. I love the fact that we've finally got a big dumpster fire going that we can all agree on but I just wished it happened when these other practices came out first, this could've entirely been avoided.
---
Yeah, i just been a lol stubborn regarding not letting condi dissapear from my toons, and since i have a couple of power classes already decided to balance out between having some condi and some power for variation.
---
Thx for the suggestions , il see if i make the swap to power or not. It feels fun to play fun animations, but at the same time it feels like your really handicapped vs the rest.
---
sweet. I knew something like this would be put together as soon as they said you could share your build templates, but then they were going to charge you for some fuckin reason for build template slots.
---
Step 3: move several items out of gem store and have them in the normal game
---
No, you're right. That brings it down to 2000 gems per character for the equipment loadouts with the current max limit of 6 equipment loadouts. Nevermind maxing out per profession, say you narrow it down to 3-4; that's still $75-100 worth of gems for what was previously free.
---
Divinity 2 is not a direct sequel of Oblivion
---
If anet had community liaisons they should be fired because they're garbage. At least gaile is gone, thank god.
---
If I had used the obvious method for loading images - `D3DXCreateTextureFromFile` and such - it wouldn't have worked with d912pxy, because the proxy doesn't update these functions to dx12. That was the reason behind, say, GW2Radial not working with d912pxy until the author updated it. Thankfully I knew about these issues, and preemptively used a different method for loading images.
---
As far as I know, yeah. I know Asura twirl around. I know human males kinda crouch on their back leg and I think Sylvari males are the same. None of my Charr or Norn males are guardians or Eles so not sure about them.
---
No down state or mount weekend... but make it a two week long... And lasts forever as core.
---
Maybe not, but they could get to a *better* continent.
---
It's good that you are happy with how it looks, because in my opinion, it looks like shit with no actual theme.
---
Tbf, heavy server side database calls are likely hard to test because the tests don't scale well. There are countless examples of games adding what seem to be simple things like this that just bring the actual game servers to their knees. That doesnt absolve anet from all the other crap flying around regarding this, but after playing online games for decades, I get that things do break and testing isnt the same as the live environment.
---
They failed almost everything with these templates. I have the same issue with backpacks.
---
Me
---
You are an angel. I have been using gw2clipboard. But I will probs switch to this so it loads with arc when I open the game :D
---
Oh okay so it's in the weekly bonus chest of the boss. Thank you for the answer and have a nice day :)
---
I want something to show for what I've accomplished.  Legendary gear is a good example but so are rank titles in both PvP and WvW.  Physical rewards in this game are pretty rough these days.  The things you'll want after you've geared out your characters are thousands of gold while the loot you get is worth less than 20s most of the time.  It feels slow, mundane, and unrewarding.  I'm sure there are several people that can agree with my next statement.  Even though the price has dropped on them, getting precursors doesn't even feel the same it did before.  I think this is due not only to the price but because its more of the same.  Even if you've gotten one or a dozen, the excitement seems to wear off pretty fast.  While I'm not sure how it feels exactly, I would imagine getting an infusion these days has the same feeling as getting a precursor a few years ago.  Now don't get me wrong either, I think everyone would love even the 50g precursors, but the feeling just isn't the same anymore...if that makes sense.
---
I fully support a new game. Ultimately I'm hoping there are a few things that really highlight this.
---
* Product people are important. Without strong product, you can not exist as a company. What this means is not people who just develop features by metric. We need strong product leads who know what is _right_ not just what appears to make money on paper. We need advocates that want not just a good game, but a good ArenaNet game.
---
* Old School Runescape / Classic WoW -- there is clearly a market for a truly old-school MMO. They are crushing the competition right now. The reality is if you're into the "old school" mmos, you have the niche. If you're into a more modern raid scene, that exists with XIV. Those games have soaked up a lot of the market. New guild wars would need to double down on action combat, say fuck condis forever, and reimagine what a build-focused, difficult to play, incredibly unique action MMO looks like.
---
* Build a new engine from the ground up. Remove known limitations but keep the best-in-class technology that makes ArenaNet who they are. It's insane how good they are from a tech stand point, even if recent blunders don't fully support that. Almost no down time, even with massive expansions.
---
* Keep it ArenaNet. Give us hard modes of zones. Go back to GW1 and look at what made things _awesome_. It wasn't running around farming one zone on repeat, and it wasn't cash shop money grabs. It was that the game respected the player. Things were difficult, and some of the best rewards were locked behind this challenging content. Stop catering to people saying it's too hard. People need to hurt and be challenged.
---
* Lastly. Don't build a game called fucking guild wars and not give me a GvG mode. It's a slap in the face.
---
Nah, open a ticket.
---
&gt; Grats, could have gone very bad though
---
We'd never know because then the OP wouldn't have published the video.
---
For all we know 5 mins later they were done to 500 ecto and 100 gold =P
---
"WvW'ers" will hate it because it'll flood their gamemode with toxic casual PvE queens.
---
Pretty much this, the tech debt is a big one. The new developers likely don't know what the fuck to do with the code, hell they admitted as much in regards to dungeons.
---
I don't know what your point is, if you have one.
---
Awesome! Precisely what was wanted!
---
Literally everything else about Charr like feline, other than the horns (which don't even look like cow horns) and their ears. They are cats.
---
This is possibly among the best Necro Sylvari 2D art, I've seen since playing Guild Wars 2.  This is awesome, how long did it take you to make it?
---
You still paid 2000 gems per character for more inventory slots. Now you can choose, in theory.
---
and if you start a new account oyu still get no LS episodes regardless if you buy or not so yeah
---
Font be afraid to experiment. I personally play a condi herald with shiro/mallyx maxe-axe/staff. I use an aggressive build that works around song of the mists and legend swap to burst (Shiro-&gt;f2-&gt;PT-&gt;axe5-&gt;mallyx-&gt;EtD-&gt;mace2/3). Its works ok but im not great at it. Thr blind spam is nice by mace3 during EtD.
---
Glhf
---
&gt;If u try out herald i would recommend swapping the sb for staff. 
---
Not really a recommendation because you can only wield SB as a Renegade o_0
---
Amateurs, just stop playing at all !
---
^^^^/s
---
Thanks!
---
They had one. Too many players violated NDA’s.
---
if you weren't looking for social interactions you'd play a single player game
---
Yea, that makes sense. Do you think it would still be possible then to make a gear template as with delta's build templates?
---
Yeah and how many of these skins are ugly as fuck ?
---
How many of them can be earned through a really poor game design ?
---
What about the ridiculous price of the sigils of nullification when the requiem armor came out ?
---
What about the visage of the khan-ur which is completely based on rng with an extremly low drop chance ?
---
Ebon vanguard shoulders ? gated behind a strike mission with 0 challenge, just boring content...  
---
You want the new halloween scarf, hey there's an achievement to get it ! Oh wait you can just buy it from the candy merchant.
---
celestial infusion vs starborn outfit ? (I don't need to explain this to you  many people already complained about it)
---
Even the thunderhead peaks weapons were bugged when it came out, some of the required achievement didn't work at all...  
---
And there's many more of this non sense.
---
Stop being so blind and narrow minded xD
---
It's almos like Mike O saw the impending controversy and said "Fuck it, I'm out!  NCSoft Fuckers are ruining the game with their demands and I'm not going to be blamed for it."  So he left and made a new company just to be far away from the dumpster fire when it was lit.
---
If you want to directly put things from Morrowind into Oblivion, yes, but functionally, Oblivion could do pretty much everything Morrowind could and more, barring limitations like having to load into towns instead of everything being open.
---
Things like spellmaking were more limited in Oblivion possibly for some semblance of balance or preventing game breaking, but it's still there.
---
The point is less about the games directly translating and more about a direct sequel on a modified engine being unable to provide even a basic form of an old QoL feature that available on the older game.
---
Gw2 didn't even have a way to save trait templates until now. Not even that.
---
Is there, or will there be any way to save new gear templates using this system?
---
I mean would it really not be true that theyre working on that rn considering the ammount of backlash?
---
Saying we are looking into it doesnt fix it or change it, in fact many companies says this, and People still bash 24/7, it would be good if they give information for sure, but i just dont see how are we still thinking theyre not looking at this when its breaking some Parts of the game, i think its a bit implied that they must work on this, not only because of the backlash and gem price, but also for its Bugs.
---
I agree with more communication thought, but im sure theyre already working on this even when they dont say it.
---
I would say a reward is meaningful when there is either a cosmetic or QoL associated with it. While the method of acquisition is a process opposed to a one time thing.
---
For example, legendary armor is a process of doing a series of achievements in raids, and repeating raids to finally be able to craft it (speaking personally, in the 6 years of gw2 and thousands of hours, no reward felt as meaningful as crafting my first legendary armor set).
---
Something like dhuum throne didn't feel as rewarding for some reason, I suspect it's either because it had no QoL or because it was a one time thing that I never repeated.
---
For example i barely do pve this days besides story missions, mostly wvw and tbh they got better with rewards on it.
---
Reward for me in a game is about getting stuff that is meaningfull while enjoying What you do and not feel like a grind.
---
For example in Wvw i get many stuff that while i dont use them or need them, i can sell it and get gold which i can use to do or grt w/e i want or need.
---
You need to get that respectful ability to allow others to have thoughts the F off of reddit before you get torched my man.
---
Not like you can actually play with all DC's, so at least EAnet was nice enough to accommodate that.
---
No, since there are no way to copy/paste gear templates into the game. I don't possess neither skills to make the addon interact with the client in a way that would allow that, nor the desire to keep such functionality up to date with game updates and increase the likelihood of ANet coming down on me. This addon is strictly for builds and examining existing ArcDPS templates.
---
I wonder how far they go with that, because if they go too far (which I expect they will) the backlash will be even worse.
---
Are we certain this is safe...kind of taking fro Anets poclets
---
This isn't something new from Anet
---
Read about how arc worked compared to GW2's implementation. Also a poor comparison.
---
One day I will give my Rev a condi set...but still enjoy Hammer Rev far too much in WvW I guess.
---
You might enjoy running Burn DH in WvW as well.  Great for punishing unorganized players. Drop a Sword of Justice on a group huddled around a ram and watch the stacks of burning just melt them.  Not as effective against an organized group and I don't find it effective 1v1, but it's great if you're Outnumbered and constantly defending your Keep.
---
&gt; The UI is really hard to see when arcdps is set to under 100% opacity. Not sure if it's just me, but I'm on 60%.
---
Not sure what I'm expected to do about it.
---
&gt; I dismissed the panel about "arcdps templates detected" and can't seem to find a way to reenable it, or place a "view gear templates" button right on the main screen. That would be really helpful.
---
You can access the buttons again in the settings menu (the cog icon in top-right), but if you really want to restore the "arcdps templates detected" message again, you can open `\Guild Wars 2\addons\arcdps\arcdps.buildpad\config.ini` and change `ArcDPSMigrationHintHidden = 1` to `0`.
---
Comes down to details for me. 
---
* Mounts for instance should be insanely harder to get and insanely harder to "master" (getting the mastery points). This applies to all mastery related skills. 
---
* Armor pieces and weapons in game should not be worse than their counterparts in the gemstore.
---
* Many armor/weapon sets don't have a collection associated for some reason. 
---
* Many armor/weapon sets are tied to time gates and easy tasks, instead of actually being good at the game.
---
* Many rewards simply are not good. Titles for instance are bland. Most people don't even know what the rare titles are.
---
* There is no real way to show how skilled you are at pvp or wvw in pve. The vice-versa is the same.
---
All these things combined lead to a lack of interest in pretty much 90% of the content. I loved grinding out my legendary armor, because I knew people would recognize my effort in getting it. Now grinding out normal armor / weapon sets .. not really the same.
---
Games nowadays shows the mentality of the world at large when it comes to economy. Make a Game with an emphasis on in game purchasing...it becomes the norm and then consumers wont stop their natural tendencies to buy.
---
I look at these games i used to live in and truly enjoy the casual non pressured feeling of exploration. Gw2 really was a beacon of hope in the Free To play MMORPG sector. Now it's exactly what most other games are. Show them the Shinies and they will buy. We all are Skritt!!
---
Next thing is "You can logon to a non-buggy server for 2000 gems".
---
Exactly this. It doesn't fucking matter if FFXIV has builds or not. It has templates that actually work.
---
Disingenuous. Same platform but different requirements as I've clearly articulated. If gw2's skill and attribute system were the same this wouldn't be an issue.
---
&gt;I'll put it in less passive terms. The reason things got this bad is because dumb asses like you as much as anet incompetence. You're writing blame off to anet but frankly some of you people are so naive it's painful to see.
---
&gt;You'll whine about any post that isn't positive or fits your ideas. You'll go full aggro on any posts that don't make you feel happy or good inside (See you whining about passive-aggresive while flaming in the same post. Consistency?). Meanwhile you're completely oblivious to the effects that come from all the BS you're advocating.
---
And again, you're just lashing out at me for defending Anet, a thing I did not do, because you're too wrapped up in being mad on the internet to stop and read, let alone think. But since you're mad about build templates, about Anet running things poorly, and now about my comment insulting you, the wires in your brain crossed and now you can't even remember what you're trying to be mad about with this comment. Maybe take a break from arguing on reddit for an hour or two, regain your ability to process words.
---
EAnet. Hehehe
---
That is something that was always an interesting aspect in AION to have the box army sieging player controlled objects. 
---
And I think it would be a nice additions to get focus on defending objectives instead of endless zerging/ktrain. The longer the NPCs hold it the more it scales and quicker it scales.
---
The recommendation is about what the 2nd weapon set should be, not about replacing sb in general.
---
More specifically he/she is recommending to use staff and not sword+shield.
---
What's your gripe with BfA? I've heard multiple different answers from people. Is it the progression system they introduced?
---
Or a a healthy dose of realism.
---
I wanted to say that I agree with your statement, and make an example of how we don't have to care about how they get their product done - just like they don't care how you get the money to buy it.
---
&gt; Dude, tone it down with the passive aggressive comments.
---
Don't worry, there are people like me here if you don't like passive aggressive comments. I'm just aggressive. Now shut up, he's right.
---
Not sure about you but my Lance does 300-400 dmg to guards! Maybe you should see a doctor about your Lance not working.
---
Maybe a collection achievment for a legendary item that isn't frustrating to do, and maybe there would be a fun suprise scene in the end that will make you remember, instead of doing it and after some months you would forget how you got your item.
---
Gw2 templates function in the same way. More so if you add the gear templates. I just covered this. I also just covered the monetization and lack of implementation at launch. You're repeating yourself.
---
To say Im disappointed is beyond comprehension. Physically ill, absolutely disgusted, completely disillusioned. Trying to figure out what was the last 7 years for.
---
Can you send me one please
---
The gear templates are not functional. You're repeating yourself.
---
Could get behind this statement until the ^
---
Reminds me of GW1 when I would have a hord of minions behind me all the time.
---
Rampage is **not** dead.
---
The #3 and #1 (the damage skills) still do a ton of damage, its just the cc skills no longer do ridiculous damage and  you can't just spam them for the sake of one shotting someone :)
---
Rampage is still good, its just way less cancer and oppressive.
---
You act as if FO4 wasn't a thing. Or FO3 was an objectively good game. Or everyone loved the bug ridden mess that Skyrim was. Or that they didn't try to get away with their Creators Club.
---
It's a good idea but it should be random or else some people that want to get the WvW rewards might decide to play only in a certain week instead randomly.
---
It seems much more obvious that they are working on getting the current implementation stable(given the feedback they have given about that) as a priority above any suggestions to change it
---
&gt; I have a question on the "increased damage to enemies while above threehold", does it increase the condi damage as Well or overall power damage?
---
I just tested it with necro soul barbs, gain 10% extra damage after entering or leaving shroud and one stack of bleed dealt 144 damage with and without the buff, so propably only power damage.
---
&gt; As for condi food any preferences  
---
I would suggest Koi cakes and tuning icicles, both cost less than 2.4 silver each. The thing is tuning icicles work based on precision and expertise but you have none. Condition utility based on toughness have to be crafted with season 3 currency which is annoying.
---
furnace taken
---
Since you're out of codes, I'm going to just ask.... what does it contain?
---
I mean they can’t shut down Google Docs or Notepad lol
---
You'll wake up milked by eanet
---
To be completely fair, I don't play BfA so I don't have any gripes with it per se. I'm honestly just in it for the lore. And the memes. And the salt.
---
I've been running Engineer as a "main" since Heart of Thorns launched. Let me tell you \*dramatically eats an entire pack of cigars\* you don't know how good you have it these days, kid. I played Condi core engie back when it was the only option to even be considered for raids and let me tell you... \*eats another crate of cigars\* ... I could play a piano like the best of 'em.
---
Okay so seriously, though, I think Rifle static discharge Holo is probably the way for you to go. Links follow:
---
[http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PeQAQlJwiYHMKGKWeXdvVA-zRIYRU0XG1mIVUEuNA-e](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PeQAQlJwiYHMKGKWeXdvVA-zRIYRU0XG1mIVUEuNA-e)
---
\[&amp;DQMmLxUdOSsqDwAAVxYAAKMAAADlFgAA8BUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=\]
---
You use Rifle as your weapon and plink away at mid-range, also firing off toolbelt skills to proc static discharge and Kinetic Battery. If you want, pop holo forge and use the 4 skill to do damage at range. Ideally you dip into this when the enemy is stunned from something like your elite Prime Light Beam (or AED's toolbelt) and then you use that opportunity to do big melee DPS in the forge. When the enemy recovers, you dodge back and pop out of forge and resume plinking. Rifle is great for this since you can knock enemies away with rifle 4, use rifle 2 to keep them locked in place, and yeet yourself into space with rifle 5.
---
Given what you mention in your post, I think this is ideal for you since if will let you largely pull your weight while also teaching you how to improve.
---
Now, to your other point, plain old engineer doesn't really measure up to its elite specs. I worry that ANet's going to nerf the elite specs more when they need to buff core engineer, but that's another discussion. I think Engineer is one of the classes that still feels like their elite specs are straight upgrades from core specs. Also, in general, Engineer is one of the more punishing classes to keep up on rotations and putting out max DPS.
---
&gt;let's shed some insight shall we?
---
You make a good point that things *can* be chaotic and failures can happen even when people do a fairly reasonable job of crossing their t's and dotting their i's. However there are ways to mitigate this kind of risk and I rarely see "the business" (apart from maybe at a startup in its early years) forcing engineering to cut corners on HA architecture or stress testing, etc. Frankly it's just something that development or engineering neglects to do, for whatever reason, whether ignorance or lack of experience or negligence.
---
In this particular case, I simply can't make excuses for the kind of steadfast commitment to mediocrity that ANet has displayed. This has been top-to-bottom, inception-to-launch a cascade of failures. There's plenty of blame to spread around every layer of the organization for this one, and that includes the developers.
---
The build management feature is poorly *designed*, poorly *implemented*, poorly *tested*, and poorly *sold*. The sad thing is that it should not take much *longer* to do those things well; it just takes better people doing the work. Better processes, better tooling, and less technical debt can make a huge difference, but those too are the responsibility of the technical staff, because "the business" usually has no sense of the importance or even existence of these things. In ANet's case, if anything, the opposite may be true given the company's roots and its founders having been *highly* technical.
---
Build management was not well thought through in the first place is how it violates the principle of least surprise so much. That has *nothing* to do with non-technical stakeholders, unless you consider UX staff non-technical but they too are still "in the trenches."
---
almost as if there were INEPT.
---
What happened to the WvW / Guild Based matching?  Is that ever coming?  I heard about it a year ago.
---
Well what makes the build good is actually some traits synergies otherwise you can't perma unload your way threw core tyria without thinking. I c'ant check right now and will probably be too lazy to look at it in detail but woodenpotatoes video on theif open world build covered this so just check it out and you are good.
---
Once you get this sorted out use the authenticator app instead. Their email and sms always mess up. I use an app called authy because it has backup and can sync between pc and phone apps.
---
Or buy 3 character slots, get 5700 gems worth of slots, and have about 37$ left over. UNGA BUNGA ANET BIG BRAIN.
---
&gt; and when they finally add it, it's so broken that even the servers are having some big problems
---
Well I guess now we know why the previous dev team always said *No* to build templates. 😅
---
I've only seen 2 in all ranked matches so far. 1 sword/focus weaver in qualifying matches who was very passive and went down a tad too fast even for an unskilled player.
---
The other was a tempest with a staff spamming condition removal and running around like a headless chicken. It made others a bit more durable, but didn't last long when focused. 
---
Not enough to tell yet.
---
You have to find a way to make core F5 useful
---
Is this a real TEST guild or just borrowing the name ?
---
It's intended to avoid needing to remember all the keybinds.
---
&gt; and when they finally add it, it's so broken that even the servers are having some big problems.
---
What did you expect? That monetized features are less susceptible for *unexpected* bugs?
---
Build Templates affect many parts of the system, it's relatively normal that the bugs affects many systems too. That's logical thinking.
---
&gt; how did they seem to not test this at all to the point even the servers can't handle it?
---
Wow.... just wow... There are still people who think a system on a testserver is the same as on a liveserver with hundreds of thousands of players doing hundreds of thousands different things? Sorry, you are out...
---
No one said they paid 1 billion gems. That's not even the point.
---
Cleans up my inventory
---
It's actually so dumb that when trading with high valueable items u need to go outside of the trading post. Sucks man, hope they unflag u.
---
&gt; where Blizzard will reveal their strategy for making BfA even worse
---
WoW mobile? xD
---
The only company I can think of that's worse than Anet is DE, in horrifying how they do this shit. Unfair to you and their communities, though at least Anet doesn't ransom your account.
---
I mean, we do have phones, don't we?
---
[At ArenaNet we take your feedback very serious!](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/634072553731653642/639014954514776074/anet_feedback.gif)
---
On the other hand it would have given value to materials and equipment that uses niche stat combinations. There are quite a lot completionists who would want to craft stats they would otherwise never want.
---
Is that an official Anet app?
---
Hearing and reading stuff like this breaks my heart. I’ve been playing since launch and recently took a break in 2016 and been on and off ever since. But seeing that they not only do this to long time players but also no direct conversations is really bad on their side of things. Without the players, this game can sink fast. The player/customer is the most valuable asset to that company.
---
Isn't that thing always bugged on release lol?
---
Do you want honest opinions or do you expect us to be nice?
---
In the Netherlands by law, this is not even allowed. You bought something from someone without knowing that it was not obtained by legitimate ways, and thus you acted in good faith. Even though Anet stated a policy around these kind of trades, I feel really sorry for you that this happened.
---
&gt; So, it’s my fault and they won’t return anything, because they don’t support of game trade.
---
It's the same thing with fake money. If the bank, supermarket or whatever finds out that you payed with fake money - even if you don't know it's fake - AND even if you *do* know it and bring it to the police or to your bank, they will take away the money and don't give you any (real) money back.
---
Have the ticket escalated.
---
Does the law actually address trading virtual items in that way?  OP didn't buy anything.
---
This. 
---
Have been using gw2clipboard ovelay, but buildpad loads with the game if you use arc.
---
If you dont use arc I recommend the clipboard
---
Just asking, but why thief? Mesmer is an obvious choice, but wouldn't a scourge be better than thief there?
---
Responses like this one are 98% of why spite is such a driving factor
---
I'm not allowed to support the game without someone telling me I'm wrong and that I'm a terrible person for doing so
---
So "gods damned, I'm gonna support it no matter how bad it gets," because why the hell would I side with people who tell me off for saying "you know, I actually like X and Y."
---
But the consequences and actions available in an MMO vs a real world economy are different.
---
That's pretty awesome. :)
---
Choose how? There isn't an option to refund inventory slots to pay for equipment loadouts.
---
I think they were making a comment on what they liked about build templates in general and misunderstood what you meant by addon.
---
Oh ok I get it now lol
---
The way it works isn't that being banned requires money to undo in itself, but that in removing the platinum from your account, it sends you into the negatives (since you bought something with it), and they keep you banned until you buy plat to get back into the positives. I think the reasoning behind it is because there are consumables and such that, once used, they cannot revert, so you become indebted to DE for those items.
---
One of the most stupid thing about the game. Those items are so rare that people don't even use official trading tool because it sells for 2-3x more than what's supported. Even if you had 1m gold, you would never be able to get that item in supported by the game way because there are so many buy orders that they will never be completed.
---
i now its hard to get for casuals who dont bother or care about running efficiently and other peoples time and run always with the same 1-2 build in every single game mode, but there are still people who but some effort into optimization ... but i guess we will have less and less people who care with this current trend.
---
Now, I haven't played GW2 in quite some time... but I'm a bit confused as to why it's even okay that they decided to keep 20k gold of yours due to someone else trading you an item that in some point in its existence was suspected of being traded at least once for real money.
---
It's not like you can determine by looking at an item, "Oop, yeah, this was traded via real money at one point!". Wouldn't this same thing apply to items on the in game market? If I break down and buy that legendary weapon I've always wanted off of their market, there's just a *chance* that they'll show up to my account and be like "Nope! Real money was transferred at one point during this item's lifespan! We're taking it, not giving you any refunds, flagging your account, and banning you for a bit!"?
---
If that's *actually* how things can happen in GW2 these days, I think I'm going to continue my long break from the game...
---
Everyday this company becomes more and more of a joke
---
About 2 years ago I asked one of the devs (on reddit) about this exact situation, and if I needed to be worried about getting punished for receiving RMT gold/items unknowingly. His response was to basically tell me he'd stop interacting with us if I kept asking silly questions.
---
&gt; To which they respond that my account will still be flagged for RMT because I broke the rules.
---
Ah, I missed that part. 
---
On the one hand I agree to you, but on the other hand I can understand (or at least imagine) why they do that. I mean yes, you have a video where you bought it and used GW2 exchange, but it doesn't really proof that you had nothing to do with the RMT (no accusion). 
---
I mean, if someone does RMT, he could do exactly what you did and bring up exactly the same proofs. And if he get cought, he could write the same things like you did and pretend that he did know nothing. 
---
In my imagination (because I'm not sure if they actually do like I think) the flag is just a warning. Like "okay, this account was involved in RMT at some point in any way, let's keep an eye on this". 
---
And the CS even said that it won't affect your account as long as you don't break any rules. 
---
I think the only question is what happens if the same thing happens again -&gt; you accidently buy an RMT item again. Will the flag affect the supports decision. Since he wrote "may", we won't know.
---
Perhaps the community perception of ArenaNet is currently in a sufficiently poor state for people to finally acknowledge that their disciplinary system has always been capricious, unjust, and excessive? 
---
This is the company that tried to issue (as I recall) permabans to players at the game's launch because they named their characters after real people/characters (e.g., Abraham Lincoln, James T. Kirk, etc.) and only converted them to temp bans (with a stern "it will be permanent next time" warning) after it drew attention on gaming media sites. 
---
Then their was the ban they issued relatively early in the game's life to people for falling while trying to climb the *intended route* to view a Vista in Rata Sum (or Metrica Province; can't recall) because the cheat detection system thought their falling was some kind of teleport hack. 
---
Worst of all is probably the risk you take every time you buy gems because if there is some error with Digital River's processing of your charge they'll permaban you over it. 
---
It's always been terrible.
---
Yes, both engi spec change it's core mechanic into a more melee focused class. And, yes, in spite of anything said to the contrary, elite specs are virtually all straight upgrades. They recently did some balance changes to make this less of a case, but it's still case more often than not.
---
Engi was in a weird place because it only had two main options, riffle and pistol, and the class is designed to rely on kits instead of weapon types. So in adding a spec, a melee option was actually a good idea. I have no idea why they did it again with Holo (other than 'the scrapper kinda sucks, lets try this again?') but here we are. (Scrapper is better now, but it sucked imo for a long time.)
---
There are two things to keep in mind here, firstly: you could play the most un-optimum build and still have fun in gw2. So play what you like.
---
And secondly, you don't HAVE to take the elite spec in it's obvious direction. You could run a Holo and still use riffle and kits. Even though the super-kit is pretty melee focused, it is more medium range. Holo-4 is actually a really good med-range burst. You could even go really off-meta and play pistol/shield Holo with flamethrower and mortar kit with condi gear.
---
Personally I run Holo with traited Battering ram and Rocket boots, I burst in melee with the Super-kit, then set them on fire and send them flying with Rocket Boots toolbelt skill, and the Battering Ram, and use riffle and Battering Ram toolbelt stuns to keep them at range while my heat drains. It's a very midrange playstyle and makes most content fun. I always have more CC than I need, and can usually take down a champs blue bar on my own, even with a bad group.
---
They have a group of player testers but there is no way it can be big enough to do proper stress testing.
---
This is closer to you bringing counterfeit money to the police and them arresting you after turning it in for being in possession of fake money.
---

---
I love and hate these sorts of posts since we only ever get one side of the story.
---
Not saying this is true but... what if the mystic coins were bought by OP with gold obtained via RMT?
---
I like rewards that do extra myself. Home nodes / gadgets or gizmos , converters. Not a fan of minis (way too many these days), books (no convenient way to store them), one time consumables, cheap currencies. If I'm going to be working hard to complete something I want the reward to be worth the effort. I do feel like the grothmar valley merchants are a step in the right direction having restrictions on purchases for having achievements done.

Noticed this jumping into PvP too which was a major disappointment and backwards movement in QoL in my opinion. I thought I'd be able to have 3 open world PvE builds, and otherwise retain my respective PvP and WvW builds. 
---
Nope! What good is build templates at this point if 1 has to be my PvP build, 1 my WvW build, and 1 for PvE and they don't even auto switch anymore? And hell, with PvE, I regularly switch between Guardian/Dragonhunter/Firebrand depending on what I am doing (or how I want to play that day), not to mention multiple build variations on the core and FB.
---
I'm just entirely disappointed with this implementation. About all you got was extra equipment storage which is nice, but everything else got worse for the sake of monatization. For shame EAnet.
---
That title. 'Potential future changes' sounds a lot like 'definitely maybe something that could perhaps be on or off the table'. Someone didn't read the 'Communication for dummies' manual.
---
GW1 had equipment templates too for PvP.
---
because i know the whole story and the whole guild of people who watched him farm the gold and these stupid coins. told you, joke's on you.
---
That really sucks man. I'd be miffed about the 20K gold too ...
---
Just to go on a tangent here, I don't see why their RMT logic only applies through off TP trades...if some RMT'd an item and listen it on TP and another person buys it unbeknownst the RMT involved, based on the logic given by ANet wouldn't that person also be banned? Oof
---
There's no passion from EANet with this game anymore. That was clear when they wanted to move onto other projects, but that was shutdown. Now it's just a matter of "how can we monetize everything"?
---
Thank you.  I was looking for "Chak Infusion" in the emails, doh - that email is sufficient enough for me.
---
Got a source for that or are you just trying to stir more shit?
---
Shop your issue around to some of the gaming magazines??
---
But i do agree with you and i hate when ppl do post fake stuff i wish someone from anet would answer and explain more
---
The core problem here is that ArenaNet insists on making items so rare (and thus valuable) that their system for trading items between players (Trading Post) falls flat on its face. Maybe they should look at that.
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
The fact there is a (10k) gold limit in the TP is a joke.
---
Anet are literally encouraging people to use shady methods in order to sell/buy items that actually worth something.
---
That only works for products purchased with real world money though. So gems, expansions, etc. are all protected but in game items purchased with in game currency (gold) do not fall under consumer law. It's just part of the game.
---
Ok man that is insane. First of all, you didnt break any rules, even tho you found your counter trader on external site, everything was done in game and you used an item (MC) to buy the infusions. 
---
By how they treat it, you could potentially break the rules, if you just receive random mail with an item and not sending it back to the source, because it could be acquired via RMT. 
---
I am honestly surprised that you are not MAD. I would serioursly consider suing them. They do not even have an option to trade very rares items in-game (10k bid limit on TP), so the only option to trade such items is via mail/guild storage. This is harreament and/or reketiring. Not that i still had any hopes for anet as a gaming studio, but this really blew my mind. 
---
If you set up a go fund me campaing for the costs of the law suit, i will be the first to donate.
---
Same thing happened to a guild mate of mine.  ArenaNet actually permabanned them.
---
Go figure.
---
One Lead GM, who might as well be the same that gave you your last two replies, made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GW2Exchange/comments/c3hmr8/reminders_about_out_of_game_trading/) about 4 months ago on r/gw2exchange, reminding its users about the risks trades outside the TP entail.
---
I haven't even downloaded it yet and I am super excited!
---
&gt; ArenaNet has no vision anymore.
---
More like no competent leadership/management. I'm sure there was vision at one point, among the actual developers.
---
I mean, stuff like jumping puzzles are obvious examples of developers pushing great ideas almost on their own. I'd wager many of the things that made the game great in the first place were ideas that came from below, outside of management; some maybe even without their approval or supervision.
---
Raids are another good example. Like them or not, they did great at the beginning, because the team building them had more freedom than the rest of the company, since they were a "let's try" kind of thing. The whole game was going down the toilet, and raids, the only "unmanaged" team, was doing great. That's a huge red signal for you there.
---
Then as raids got established your usual dirty hands started trying to "improve" them and they went down the road, like pretty much the rest of the game.
---
And the other way, I can buy tons of gold via RMT, then send it to loads of random accounts, and get all of them banned.
---
20k gold are really big amount of money. I would care.
---
thanks but its my fault for trading outside of the game i realise that unfortunately too late but more upset of the way they deal with those stuff
---
But no law suit!
---
No it’s not it’s the kill. I had alrdy killed them and then my achievement progressed to that point and the kill didn’t retroactively apply so I had to wait another week.
---
Yeah, WvW-commanders and other community-figures basically with a potential disaster waiting to happen above their head all the time. As a commander I got a couple of bigger donations and every time there is this small feeling of fear that I might get gold from a bad apple or I might even get trolled on purpose with it. So far everythign was always fine but oh boy...
---
Maybe leaving it white like every other single title would have been a better idea. Color coding in the UI should be prioritized over petty aesthetics.
---
Same for me. If you don't do it when the maps come out, you'll have that problem with them being empty. On the other hand, why would they stay..?
---
Nowhere in that post does it state that your acc will be flagged for RMT and given a temp ban if the other guy turns out to have been using RMT.
---
lol this is a video game completely owned by a company, on their servers, they can do whatever they want. They can say "we stop the servers tomorrow, bye !" and that would be completely legal.
---
buying stuff off-site is a risk. you took the risk and it ended badly. this is standard function for games. because anet doesnt monitor off-site trade, it cracks down on them harsh. undoubtedly part of this is that people have been sharing their accounts freely for this type of laundering and tos-breaking. so on the surface the accounts look normal but theyre not.
---
plus i just really doubt all these stories, ive seen so many that seem reasonable and then the news quietly break that OP was actually botting or something but nobody wants to admit they believed a cheater or that anet isnt comically evil (why would it be. theyre trying to make money)
---
i feel sorry for you losing so much gold and effort but this is a risk you took. the emails are polite and standard customer service. plus nowhere is it mentioned that it was the chak egg sac or what was removed so it just makes me question it all is all. you couldve screenshotted all emails instead of just a few
---
Either that or he can't read.
---
Hey u/Dornsinger
---
You're an idiot
---
honestly , i think anets security system and so on are taken care by glue sniffing chipmunks
---
I'm not sure, I've never played norn guardian
---
So you get 8 hours and not perm because they are aware you wasn't really at fault? 
---
This is stupid. If arenanet don't want people trading outside the game then stop making the fucking drop rates so absurd, This is THEIR creation. The reason the prices is so high is completely on them.
---
Since they refused to raise the AH limit, they just expect people to sell shit underpriced?
---
I'm losing more and more faith in Arenanet as time goes on, not that I had much to begin with.
---
It's so ridiculous. "Think of the devs!" 
---
Their product is full of bugs, literally gamebreaking bugs at that. They have to own up to it, accept and admit that they released a buggy product. It's not the customer's problem why it happened. They released a shitty patch, they get deserved criticism. This isn't the official forums or some other safe space with no negative thoughts allowed. 
---
Now, with enough goodwill consumers can overlook some problems here and there, but we're running low on that.
---
&gt; It's silly for people to crap on them moving on from the game.
---
&gt; 
---
No, it's silly they abandoned gw2 before releasing anything and now those projects ere cancelled and they are left with nothing. This company is a fail.
---
listen, im not here to prove you stuff or win your support. if anything, i understand your position, cause if it weren't for the bias, i would have thought the same. people lie, and people swear they are honest, and it happens every day. this is not the case, though.
---
i know OP for about six years at this point, both online and IRL, so he is not just a guildmate. i honestly don't care at this point how biased i seem, because this whole situations triggers me to end. both because i understand you (and people like you) and because i know you're wrong.   
---
this person was nothing but honest the whole time, so it's only fair that he at least gets some support after what Anet has done, even if it's just words.
---
Unless you had legendaries, which meant you didn't need any additional storage space. 
---
And you don't get to choose now, because you have to have the build storage. I was perfectly fine with having gear take up half my inventory without having bought any bag slots and I could freely switch between that gear. And if you did buy the extra bag space because you wanted more room for drops or whatever, now you still have to buy the build template storage even though you already bought the extra bag space. Sure you get that bag space for other stuff, but chances are you don't want that extra bag space if you had only bought bag slots to comfortably store your extra equipment.
---
except for the fact that you don't put items in the trading post which another person gets back, you just get a stack of same items but are completely new
---
&gt; Legally, any in game items or gold (gems are a different matter) belongs to Anet and not the account user, who only purchased a temporary license to play around with it and that license can be revoked at any time.
---
While true of any MMO, putting it into practice should be done only in extreme measures if you ask me. The player base needs to be able to trust that what they're doing inside of the game won't be rendered worthless when they haven't personally taken part in any actions that would warrant it.
---
For instance, in OP's situation, does Anet know without question that this item had been part of RMTs? How do they check for this? Sure, sometimes the communication trail is obvious enough to make it concrete evidence, but what if a guy finds himself in possession of a Chak Infusion and decides to trade it to his friend for their Bday. The friend doesn't much care about infusions, but would love to make some quick gold, so they proceed to set up a trade with OP. You see where I'm going with this, and I know it's a hypothetical... but the player base should be able to trust that Anet wont take any extreme actions against a player unless they have solid evidence of misdoings. 
---
&gt; Anet takes up the responsibility of making sure that no RMT items are traded over the trading post, so they wont punish you, if an RMT item falls through their cracks.
---
That's good at least...
---
&gt; If you go through some lenghts to purchase items from another individiual outside the tp, you also (should) know who you are buying it from because Anet cant vet those deals themselves, so the responsibility falls on you.
---
Sort of comes back around to the problem I mentioned above. If they cannot vet the deals then it becomes overly heavy handed to take the item without reimbursing OP. They can tell from their logs and from OP's video that OP payed a player with non-RMT currency in game to obtain an item. Unless they can prove that OP was in on the RMT shenanigans, OP should not be punished along with the offenders.
---
Sorry if I come off as a bit ranty, but despite OP being okay with losing 20k gold, from my experience with GW2 and farming for gold... that would have been completely devastating to me. To have it happen through a trade that OP could not have reasonably known involved something against Anet's policies? I'm quite certain that I would have just quit the game and never looked back. Is Anet within their rights to do it? Absolutely. They should, however, consider the negative impacts that their current policies and enforcement procedures have on loyal/innocent players.
---
They could, but it would cost gems to purchase and use each time, and it wouldn't work.
---
As a new player with tons of stuff to do (hearts, events, exploring and completing maps, crafting, achievements, dungeons etc etc) i'm quite overwhelmed. I'm lvl 37 now and there's this dungeon in Ascalon for lvl 30+
---
Is it good when i do them as soon as i hit the recommended lvl in terms of rewards? Better said, do i miss out on something if i wait til lvl 80? Does the loot scale with your lvl?
---
I apologize if I came off as suspicious or distrusting - I've seen far too many of these threads where OP is proven to be a liar and is creating the thread to stir up drama/hate against the game/company that there were rightfully banned from.  So now when I see a thread like this, in the back of my mind I am wondering if OP's agenda is to 'get back' at the company or are they actually telling the truth.
---
Maybe you will get lucky and one of the anet support GMs will stop by.  They have done this a few times on previous threads like this.  Of those I've read, it is about 50/50 where OP is telling the truth, which is why I refrain from passing judgement until more of the story is known.
---
For example (for you or anyone else interested), there were a couple ban threads that were legitimately wrong on anet's part (false positives) and iirc, someone from anet posted in the thread apologizing to the people.  The most recent (a few weeks ago) was some guy who was wrongfully banned for something (forgot what) and missed one of the living season episodes, so anet gave them the episode for free and a bunch of gems.
---
Then there are those who were lying.  Usually those were about RMT.  Sway the public opinion I guess?  There was one, not sure if it was this game or Path of Exile (which also has similar posts on their subreddit) where the OP swore up and down that they were innocent.  Then a game GM came in and posted proof that OP was lying.  I thought it was funny because the thread was full of people believing OP and saying how bad the game devs were... and then the truth comes out and OP is never heard from again.
---
I wasn't. I always say its bad to have all your eggs in one basket.
---
"Functional keyboards" - you made me smile ty.
---
I mean does reading and listening lies will make you happier once you realise its a lie? (like all the games that have come up lately). I mean a lot of People want them to tailor the game based on feedback from players, but even then, a lot of players have many different points that they want, so tbh i dont think they should prioritize that as much as What they broke with the patch. 
---
Not saying PR aint important, it really is. But on the other hand even with the old gw team they didnt do anything related to Player feedback, so having gaile or not in the team doesnt change anything. One of the source for nerfs and buff has been mostly pvp (not wvw), and they have done absolutely nothing to the stale that builds and classes are. 
---
I rather see action Than words on devs, one PR representative from anet can come and say yes we are working on this, or are doing "x" thing, but at the end of the day, they might or not be actually doing that. And if theyre ppl Will still complain about the time theyre taking to fix it. 
---
Thats why i rather having focus into the Bugs and issues that lately is Making the game suffer, Than spending time, even when it might not even take too much in saying words that even People will still bash at it.
---
TLDR: While PR is clearly important, and listening to feedback is good, they need to focus their efforts in fixing what is breaking the game for many players, before even Making a proper statement or even analizing Player feedback (which sometimes it might not be easy to implement considering the diff approaches that every one wants) 
---
Anet needs a fresh team, and hopefully end up doing more Than their old team after so many years.
---
I would be filing a suit and sending this story to various MMO outlets. This is beyond reasoning and should never happen, especially when they are clearly able to see you have not RMT'd your gold, it is your gold; a fuck load of gold. To top it off by flagging you for someone else's activity is the cherry on top, forget the ban for added salt.
---
If they are going to remove the item that is obviously RMT'd by someone else, from you, then you need compensated for your purchase. That is hundreds to thousands of hours of playtime to obtain that amount of gold for most people, this is disgusting.
---
"that's not the problem" is also in the title, lmao.
---
You dont need much visionary thinking if you just listen and communicate with your playerbase. I see this in every indie game alpha Im a part of. The dev(s) lay down the basic constructs of a product and the roadmap, we test it and improve it.
---
But not just in early stages of developing a game is this possible. A public test server is the directest approach to this in an mmo, though detailed communication works as well.
---
I have to say, I was really surprised to see the build "templates" get put into the game unchanged, after all the feedback they got before release when the community saw them for the first time. And this is what concerns me the most. Its like Anet has become so unwieldy to not be able to re-work a feature last minute, so uncommunicative that they dont listen to their own content creator partners.
---
**So, yes, Im sure you are correct with your Steve Jobs quote. And while theres still great gamedevs working at Anet, marketing is running - and ruining - the show.**
---
Everything release always comes with  'a fly in the ointment' that can ruin it partially or completely for some people.
---
Humans focus more on the negatives than the positives, so they need to quickly address these when they come up, or it'll only get worse.  
---
Take Prologue: Bound by Blood. Arguably one of the best releases out there, until you realize most people will never complete the collection because they made the helmet way too rare and there's no way to get extra daily boxes, like a daily purchase in the vendor unlocked after completing achievements. Some players can let it go, but for others it can range from puzzling to outright unforgivable.  
---
It sucks that all we can do is complain and hope they'll listen, and it's very frustrating, but giving up won't ever fix anything.
---
This SO much.
---
What if OP used the in-game chat to find the player willing to sell the infusion and all communication was performed in-game? 
---
**ANET still would have acted the same**
---
What if OP found the infusion posted on the TP for 10,000G (or whatever the max listing is) and bought it via the TP?
---
**ANET still would have acted the same way**
---
Because ANET isn't mad at OP for facilitating a trade outside of the game. They are mad at OP because OP was unlucky enough to be unknowingly buying an item from someone who was involved in RMT...
---
no need to apologize i get it people wont bnelive it some wont do still becosue a lot of people come on her and lie. All i want is the account to be unflagged after spending 12k hrs+i don't want anything to happen to the account even though 20k gold is alot its not as much as what the account is worth to me
---
EVERY CLASS IS FINE IF YOU JUST DODGE ALL THEIR DAMAGE
---
BUT ALSO NERF THIEF AND MESMER FOR DODGING MY SHIT
---
Witch hunting and attacking the devs is against the sub rules. You may wish to remove this post, seeing as it only does that and adds nothing constructive.
---
You can do better expressing your concerns and criticism.
---
The problem is you really do not have any other option with something like a chak infusion.
---
They have been promising major updates for WvW for years, hell their alliance system was first announced more than two years ago.
---
That doesnt nullify my point at all. You giving them "proof" of you recieving the item doesnt mean jack shit. They have access to all things that youve traded acquired etc through logs. This all sounds like a whiny bitch getting punished for using rwt and trying to guilt trip people on reddit to try and start some kind of boycott against arena net. Its all very pathetic
---
There's probably some skritt in there somewhere.
---
Ok so whats the point in this post then. All seems redudant
---
Some of the comments are ridiculous. Why wouldn't Anet allowed this? Its a completly different implementation to how the Arc one worked. And doesn't have equipment (....yet). Anet expected stuff like this to happen or they wouldnt have made the builds copy/pastable.
---
Thanks for this detailed answer. I see now that the scaling feature is perfect for me as i always fear to miss something, which puts a bit of pressure on me. But now i can play whatever i want in my own pace.
---
I love it! Thanks again ;)
---
&gt; Not saying this is true but... what if the mystic coins were bought by OP with gold obtained via RMT?
---
Then Arenanet are even more incompetent by allowing someone to buy 13k mystic coins with real money and only handing him an 8 hour ban?
---
But it doesn't seem like that's what happened so...
---
read the emails before you comment they are referring to the infusion
---
I recommend reporting it all to the GW2 Exchange community, get in contact with the guy you traded and ask him where he got it from. People who fraud or scam trades on GW2 Exchange or other Outside-TP markets usually get banned from them, even in some cases they get banned ingame as well because they hand the reports for fraud trade to ANET as well.
---
i did they said they have another similar case that they are looking in too
---
I cant speak for anyone else, but Ive just reached my breaking point a few months ago. I didnt give up, Anet just.... smushed me with one bad decision and release after the other.
---
This game hasnt been the same since LS3, and while I mourn for the game we had pre-LS3, Im also not masochistic enough to stay fully invested in a game that did a 180-turn on its goals and principles.
---
Thats not giving up, thats accepting reality.
---
None. I hate them with passion.
---
&gt; During lay offs people get compensated, giving them time and money to find new jobs
---
How considerate a small compensation to make up for all all the stress and anxiety to find a job, which can take months. It's even better if you have a family and might require to move to a new city because the one you're in has no opportunities.
---
&gt;  The game doesn't need to be shut down, it can be maintananced by small team incorporated by ncsoft. Anet has no reason to exist.
---
Or you know, it can be maintenanced by Anet? Why kill a studio and search for a small team when you can use said team for it?
---
Look, I don't disagree with your sentiment that the game doesn't seem to be going anywhere precise, nor that they failed over the year, but I will **never** agree nor encourage the idea that a studio should be shut down. That's hardly ever the right solution.
---
Right?  Hearing OP say they don't really care about losing 20k gold(!) set off warning bells for me. 
---
Nine times out of ten- when someone gets banned on an MMO and claims "I did nothing wrong, no RMT" you find out later they weren't being totally honest. 
---
Trading for stuff out of game and then they wonder why the devs would suspect them of RMT or something fishy...
---
I understand the prohibition on using real names or copyrighted names. Most games have this sort of thing. The issue wasn't the rule itself, which is normal and I would say probably expected by most players. The problem is that whereas as far as I have ever seen other game companies just give you a forced rename when this happens (and that's what GW2 does these days if I recall correctly), they were literally issuing permanent bans in those first few days - and this was when the game needed to be purchased, remember.
---
the amount of people that don't finish reading and ask for a code here rather than pms is too damn high
---
From a humans perspective, yes, they screw with their brothers and sisters as they have a common mother. 
---
But for the salads their only sexual partners were their brothers and sisters, so it's not weird for them at all. And their biology gives them no drawback from dating their siblings.
---
&gt; It's the same thing with fake money. If the bank, supermarket or whatever finds out that you payed with fake money - even if you don't know it's fake - AND even if you 
---
&gt; do
---
&gt;  know it and bring it to the police or to your bank, they will take away the money and don't give you any (real) money back.
---
I really want to see the surveillance video of the supermarket customer who is handed change, declares one of the bills to be a forgery, demands a different bill as change and to also keep the first so as to turn in to the police.
---
Sword/pistol for melee and shortbow for ranged.
---
I like how so many posts here and on the official forums want to put hundreds of people out of their jobs simply because they agree with a game's development. /s
---
I sincerely hope I hope have to work with any of those posters.
---
&gt;IMMENSE technical debt
---
You hit the nail on the head with that.  
---
I can't stress how much this factors into limiting what designs can be implemented. In regular tech, it's already hard to convince the business side to let us work on cleaning up technical debt since it isn't considered "revenue-generating". Thankfully, my current place of work not only does focus on tech debt, but encourages us to clean up as we work on other related tasks.
---
In gaming, I imagine it's harder to justify as game companies generally don't have a consistent flow of cash constantly coming in the same way many tech companies (service providers) do. Games are largely one-and-done sales with MTX or DLC to supplement it (which can be very erratic). So instead, game devs work on new features/content and work around tech debt..... at least until it gets so bad that it has to be addressed.
---
The problem with this is that the business side AND the customers are rarely willing to halt or slow feature/content development so tech debt can be dealt with. Incredibly frustrating.
---
yep support is a bitch that do whatever they want, they put obscure policy that could result in ban and when you ask explanation, they just said they are not allowed to answer.
---
Never forget the time they tried to detect cheaters by installing literally spyware on your computer to detect stuff like CheatEngine, regardless of whether or not you were actually cheating.
---
&gt; How considerate a small compensation to make up for all all the stress and anxiety to find a new job in a field drown with competitions, which can take months. It's even better if you have a family and might require to move to a new city because the one you're in has no opportunities.
---
This is very subjective and varies amongst people, so you can't make it into argument, cause you don't know who and how will react.
---
&gt; Or you know, it can be maintenanced by Anet? Why kill a studio and search for a small team when you can use said team for it?
---
Or you know, why keep vegetative studio with all the expenses alive while you can take some of their people into your company to keep the game maintananced and save some money in the process?
---
&gt; Look, I don't disagree with your sentiment that the game doesn't seem to be going anywhere precise, nor that they failed over the year, but I will never agree nor encourage the idea that a studio should be shut down. That's hardly ever the right solution.
---
Your only argumentation is that "people will feel bad" which is not enough in business.
---
has ANET ever learned a single lesson ?
---
I did read the emails you fucking moron.
---
I mean, I agree with him though. Anyone at ArenaNet that thinks the victim should get punished is a fucking moron. 
---
I guess it’s just another bulletpoint to add to the long list of why Guild Wars 2 is failing and why the devs have proven time and time again to be entirely incompetent and totally disconnected from the game and player base.
---
&gt; But now i can play whatever i want in my own pace.
---
That's what Guild Wars 2 is all about!  You can progress by exploring, by doing dungeons, by grinding mob kills, by crafting, even by doing PvP.  Play how you want and you'll still gain XP and make progress towards various goals.
---
&gt; ANet keeps warning to use the TP
---
Expect they banned people in the past, who sold items in the trading post, because some people who where supposedly involved with RTM bought items on the trading post...
---
True but the recent balance posts would suggest that they will be taking WvW more seriously. They have also recently changed who is in charge of PvP/WvW balance so it remains to be seen where they will take the game mode from here.
---
I won't believe it until I see it but it would at least appear that the WvW neglect is coming to an end.
---
And you still call me a moron, ironic
---
well, 100% crit rate as base for every power class in pvp is biggest cancer of them all. remove that and you can start balancing skill.
---
And then there's the most forgotten ban of all.
---
The first Wintersday introduced a recipe that re-balanced ecto, but apparently they didn't mean to.
---
Rare and exotic trinkets that took 0 ecto to craft, but could return the usual 0-3 ecto, with a chance of getting a major crafting component back from salvage.
---
It raised the prices of mithril and ori, and dropped ecto to about 20 silver. Once the price of mithril and ori rose above the break-even point, you made no profit.
---
People were asking on the official forums if the mechanic was intended for more than a week, getting no response.
---
Then after about two weeks from the Wintersday patch, ANet handed out something like 1500 permabans based on former developer and ANet economist John Smith's...uh...claim that people were more-or-less duplicating ecto.
---
The early trading post was much more unstable than it is now, so everybody was willing to blame "the ecto-duping cheaters," praise John Smith, and forget about it.
---
Mind you, this was after the Godskull exploit, and the Charr Cultural Weapon exploit (which had EXPLICIT warnings, up to and including official GMs standing in front of the still-active vendor telling people they would be banned if they purchased things at the glitched price).
---
Only one of the two exploits I just noted got bans; the one with the clear verbal warnings and official statements. And that one was changed to a temp ban. The Wintersday Snowflake Trinket ban was never lifted, and everyone forgot about it, despite how overreaching it was.
---
And this was back in the days of silk and thick leather being *so* worthless, that people would just craft Rare shoulder armor, and salvage it for ecto right away.  But apparently ANet expected everyone to know that they didn't intend for the Snowflake trinkets to be used that way.
---
Yeah it's crazy right? 
---
When the official forums for GW2 came out and we had the blacked out character avatar I was so stoked on possibly seeing something that WoW has with their forums. You can see everyone's character and armory etc.
---
I was so disappointed to never see this and on top of the super nazi moderation on there drove me away real fast. 
---
It's no suprise that people are venting everything on this subreddit.
---
&gt;It's sales and marketing that decides.
---
&gt;Oh how I hate them.
---
LOL
---
That is why such items are being traded outside the TP. TP caps prices at 10k gold, you can't go above. Chak infusion price is broken for that reason.
---
So, they are nerfing Elite Specs by gutting core weapons and skills?
---
Seems very smart. /s
---
Mirages will still stay far from the fight letting the clones do the work, why not change the mechanic somehow? Make the ambushes on clone do less damage and transferring this damage to the Mesmer itself (forcing him to stay in the battle field), or make staff and scepter ambushes more utility than damage, etc etc.
---
Well lets see.
---
by all the signes you have a reading disability, so who is really a moron here is still an opened question. go over the emails once again.
---
Perfection.
---
I've always felt, that if you have to make a rule against something, you have a flawed system and you should fix the system so people don't even want to do that thing in the first place instead of making the rule.  
---
Example: Disneyland had a littering problem.  But instead of issuing fines to anyone caught littering, they just put a trash can every 20 feet.  Now no littering problem and people aren't pissed about being fined when they don't have much of an alternative.
---
What does it contain? Just curious.
---
I originally thought he meant the players but that's even better
---
&lt;3
---
I wish we had GW1 trading back. Bye bye 15% fees.
---
They also just keep trying to (unsuccessfully) re-invent the wheel..
---
At some point I think gamer should "unionize" or whatever is the correct English term because Anet is breaking way too much UE laws
---
You not posting in reply to the relevant post on purpose? Or just inept at using reddit? No offense meant, Im curious.
---
Witchhunting is going after someone with no evidence
---
I think they were trying to fix it somehow ~3 hours ago because for an hour or so the game lagged horribly on every map, for everyone.
---
&gt; This is very subjective and varies amongst people, so you can't make it into argument, cause you don't know who and how will react.
---
Can you really name me one person who enjoys losing his job in the video game industry? Every layoffs in history was met with empathy **because** we all know how harsh it is.
---
&gt; Or you know, why keep vegetative studio with all the expenses alive while you can take some of their people into your company to keep the game maintananced and save some money in the process?
---
You said you hoped Anet to shut down. That's it. Nowhere you implied originally a repurpose or a merge with other studios within NCSoft.
---
&gt; Your only argumentation is that "people will feel bad" which is not enough in business.
---
That's disingenuous. No. Layoff implies sometime a permanent loss of talent and skills. Nobody is irreplaceable, that's true, but finding new employees is also a hassle. There are clearly talented people at Anet that could be repurposed in other branches, there is no need to permanently shut down an entire studio.
---
I decided to come back last night. I was playing my 80 engineer and was trying to unlock a mount. That first story mission of POF was absolutely brutal.
---
I felt way squishier than I remember being. It's been a really long time so I feel like I'm missing something. Are we supposed to go full tanky gear now for solo or do I just suck?
---
&gt;EDIT  Don't know why this is getting downvoted.  Preventing the game  accessing build strings via the Windows clipboard would 100% prevent any  third-party tool that is designed to circumvent a game feature that -  BY DESIGN -  is a premium feature.
---
Except they marketed the ability to copy templates to notepad (or a browser or other app) as part of the feature.
---
now that is completely ridiculous. How are peopel supposed to deal with that?
---
Hey there,
---
I'm Sam Ajesté, one of the mods over at r/GW2Exchange.
---
We take the quality of the service we offer very seriously, as our rather long blacklist can suggest.
---
However, even with all the safety measures we can take, this kind of thing may happen, where through a chain of trades, some being via GW2Ex and others not, an item that originally got RMT'd finds its way into the pocket of a perfectly legit trader.
---
We'll contact the person who sold this item to naim so as to get to the bottom of the matter, and failure to answer on their part will result in an added entry on the blacklist, under the RMT section.
---
We'll also contact the CS team of ArenaNet in order to get an official stance that we can add to the subreddit's info section.
---
Sincerely,
---
Sam
---
What branches? This studio has nothing but gw2. A studio without new projects is already dead.
---
Read the fucking posts twice if you're confused then, Holy shit.
---
Thanks Sam, appreciate it!
---
https://blogs.findlaw.com/blotter/2014/08/can-you-get-arrested-for-buying-stolen-goods.html 
---
You shouldn't have to sue, the thief generally owes you restitution by default.
---
Ye, so instead of fairly "not commenting" on a matter you know nothing about you will just drop a whole heap of nonesense. Gratz
---
This one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1ipnkklT2Y
---
I improved it highly and now it even have full different layers of altitude with small minipuzzles all around.
---
Anet belongs to NCSoft. They could be given some of their projects in assistance or whatever.
---
Look, I've stated my point, you've stated yours. We can agree to disagree.
---
It's the least we could do :)
---
That second response was pretty condescending lol
---
There's also the desktop-client-server architecture of GW2 to think about. Both clients will run slightly different on each Windows and Mac OS versions it runs on (even if the user doesn't see it) and that doesn't account for specific user's PC hardware limitations, environments, etc that could also factor in.
---
A change like this can test general client use for potential bugs, but not for bugs that get triggered but some specific local setting on some player's local machine.
---
Example - I run the game in Linux using WINE Staging + D9VK + Esync. Game performs great, but I couldn't copy the new build template chat code from my game to the system. I could only copy from system into the game. I reinstalled the WINE environment and moved the game data over and it fixed the issue. Not sure what had changed to break the environment, but one little, unknown change in my environment broke a key part of a new feature in a third-party client.
---
God this is amazing! This meme is just so pure LOL
---
Resitas was working at a restaurant at a beach and was told to clean the 20 paella bowls. He decided to put them into water. When he came back the next moarning the tide took them away and he had to pay for all of them.
---
Also on his first ever work day he took the day off.
---
This is borderline entering into the pettiness and disingenous territory.
---
I don't see what else to add here. My opinion is as valid as yours, I've expressed why I disagreed. Agreeing to disagree.
---
Cheers.
---
Lmao
---
Anyone paying attention knew they had taken the road downhill long ago. And once you know the road, you already know the destination. It's all a matter of time.
---
Lot of people love to live in denial. Let that be a lesson for the next time, because trust me, there will be more. No franchise is safe from self-destruction in this modern world of us.
---
I was talking about SIX to TEN builds across NINE characters at once how about you do the fucking math?
---
Sixteen times the detail!
---
ArenaNet could set their headquarters on fire and some of the fanboys, white knights, and shills around here would still spin it out as something good for the game and the company.
---
I don't want to make judgements without more information and I hope others have the same restraint as well.  All we can do at the moment is ask questions and discern what information is available to us.
---
Like you said, we have all seen these type of posts and usually the ones that say "I did nothing wrong" have done something wrong.  However this isn't 100% the case as we have seen again and again that Arenanet is incompetent when it comes to handling out bans for credible reasons.
---
I think a good lesson for people to learn is that 'trial by public opinion' is BAD.  Don't be part of the problem.  Wait for all the facts from all sides before passing judgement.
---
Well if you say so. Toodles.
---
They can retrace from where it comes, who bought it with real money, but not only they maybe punish this guy, they gonna punish everyone who was in that chain of trades where it ended on OP's account.
---
How retarded is that.
---
If OP doesn't find a resolution for this situation, at least he knows you'll go to bat for him - a great quality to have in a friend.
---
But what if you are OPs RMT broker??  (joking!)
---
I'll give you a metaphor so people can understand how we got here...
---
Imagine an ancient civilization. Things go well for them for some time, but later on they find out that many of the development projects they had are impossible to achieve. Instead of trying to build upon them and fix stuff, the leaders of the civilization start drifting their attention towards other projects, and when those turn out to be not as good as they imagined they would be, they do the same, again.
---
Later on, the founders of the civilization and their brightest minds are expelled by divine will, and move on to start a new city. The drunkards and lepers of the civilization claim themselves as kings and drag on slaves and bandits to try and salvage their old technology, which even the old ones couldn't understand. Since they notice they can't make a grand empire, they decide to start selling the scavenged "shinies" as treasure to nearby troglodyte tribes.
---
Just ban this clown mods.
---
yes that's what I said in my first sentence. ???
---
I wanted to point ou that if it wasn't the problem, maybe you shouldn't give the post a title that stating what the problem is and not what isn't.
---
Ok, what I meant was that you don't get your money back by default. The thief needs to get put in front of a judge somehow, which means they a) need to catch him, and b) need to press charges, which isn't always a given. Orders for restitution are generally made at the same time as some other ruling for criminal charges. That means that if a stolen piece of property has been tracked to you through multiple owners, but the original thief is long gone, there is no one to charge with a crime and therefore no one to order restitution from, and you're shit out of luck. 
---
And of course, there's the principle of blood from a stone. If someone with $10 in the bank steals a $2000 TV and sells it, and you end up buying it through a middle man, and then that TV is returned to its owner and you're out a couple thousand dollars....good luck getting it from the original thief, even if they did get caught and the judge ruled against him. Then you'd have an order of restitution, but it would be a civil matter to try to obtain payment from him, and you'd probably spend more in legal fees trying to put things like wage garnishments in place than you'd ever receive in payments. 
---
My point is simply: people who buy stolen goods get screwed in the real world, and that's in the real world where it's possible to verify that the thief and the final buyer aren't working in cahoots. In an online game, sure, ANet could just magic the missing money into existence, but there's also very little ability to prove that such behavior won't be exploited to launder stolen goods into "real" gold.
---
To someone out of the loop, what is the problem with receiving gold from a hacked account? Even if something like what happens to OP happens, doesn't it get resolved fairly quickly and without too much hassle? Or is there lasting effects?
---
I understand that even a temporary ban and chat with support to unlock can be quite annoying, but with all the fear people feel in this thread it feels like there is something more I don't know about.
---
Retail WoW is just as bad as Gw2, but Blizz is at least more transparent with their direction for the game, holding regular q&amp;a's with the director where he answers really detailed questions.
---
FFXIV I don't know the community that much, but they seem fairly content from the outside, just wish I liked the gameplay like, at all.
---
Question was the middleman effected since he had the Infusion at some point?
---
Nothings changed with the hide tick box core function. 
---
What people want is to have different hide options per template.
---
I kind of disagree with nerfing Elixir U to target Holosmith stability, as this nerfs core engineer and scrapper as well, both of which do not need nerfs. I would have attacked this problem by making changes to Configuration: Eclipse.
---
they haven't learned that, its their business model :)
---
Really? There was a lot of discontent in year 1. There was no lfg tool, we all used an external website. Youd get kicked from your CoF farms if you weren't a zerker warrior. There was a lot of "I'm quitting, ANet lied" when ascended gear was announced. I can go on.
---
Not entirely true. If I'm remembering right the original plan was for the game to last 10 years
---
I have nipples, Greg...
---
so not the real TEST
---
The problem with that argument is that by allowing gem (currency purchasable with real money) to gold conversion they have given items in their game a real world monetary value and a means to acquire those items via that method. 
---
Gold may only be available in-game, but that goes out the window when you can *legitimately* purchase it. 
---
IMO, Anet shouldn't be allowed to monetarily punish players based on what is essentially an honor system.
---
haha this was really good
---
Items that have previously involved with RMT can be randomly confiscated and you can get punished (account bans, RMT flagged) for "being involved". 
---
Even if you personally were not involved in the RMT.
---
Did you really just type out that sentence and try to call me a moron? Lol yea im the one with a reading disability. At least I can actually make a proper sentence without running my brain in overtime.
---
Lots of people would use it just as some people already sell chak infusions for 10k.
---
I’m glad mike left, can’t imagine how toxic these devs are to each other
---
No my point still stands. You tried to get got caught and now your trying to rile up a community to boycott arenanet. If you didnt "care" like you originally put you wouldnt have made this thread nor respond to any of the comments here. Give up troll, you lost
---
TBH honest I would have seen this coming. Anet wants to make a percentage (of in game currency, as they regulate the economy that way) off of every sale. That's why they expect you to sell the mystic coins and buy the infusion for gold over the TP. That way they take 10% i think.
---
Rule 9 from Gw2's code of conduct that you broke:
---
&gt;You may not **buy**, **sell**, transfer or **auction** (or host or facilitate the  ability to allow others to buy, sell, transfer or auction) , or offer to  transfer, **sell** or **auction**, or **buy** or accept any offer to transfer, **sell**  or **auction**, any game Account or **game Content**, including (without  limitation) game characters, character attributes, **items, objects,  currency**, credits or copyrighted material, or any other intellectual  property owned or controlled by ArenaNet, Inc., NCsoft, the Service, or  our licensors, nor may you encourage or induce any other player to  participate in such prohibited transaction(s), except as may be  specifically authorized by the Service and by ArenaNet or NCsoft,  without first obtaining our express written permission.
---
[https://www.guildwars2.com/en/legal/guild-wars-2-rules-of-conduct/](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/legal/guild-wars-2-rules-of-conduct/)
---
You most definitely broke the rules for real-world trading.
---
Honestly, the way templates were designed they're absolutely perfect if you don't need them, so you'll be fine. Just give yourself time to get used to the game.
---
The thing to know is... once an Anet system is out it is set in stone forever. Feedback won't work, they will never change the cost, they will never go back on a decision. Arc templates are gone, that's reality. As long as you manage your expectations and understand that the company barely gives a shit about its players, the content backlog is enjoyable and you'll have a good time. Just don't expect more than that.
---
Wow, they would go to such lengths to save on heating bills to make the game better! True quality!
---
So what if you had bought it from the Trading Post? Would they still just ban someone for that?
---
You're trying to change the subject, you did break the rules of real world trading. Rule 9 in the CoC, I quoted it very clearly for you.
---
Also **no**, GMs did not say it's allowed. From your first e-mail: "the GW2exchange is not a supported method of trading items". Where has a GM *ever* encouraged real world trading. 
---
Just another rule breaking trying to play victim on Reddit, just like the last dozen.
---
You cant buy it from tp. Tp only allows 10k gold it costs 20k so only way to buy it is from exchange.
---
There's hide button under every reddit post. Use it and dont trouble your little head on others having fun.
---
Still wear my VitV because W6 and 7's titles mean so much less, there was no struggle at all to get them.
---
I'd love a God of Raids title, something to earn by clearing CM's dozens of times and keeping up with unlocking *all* achievements there are to get from raids. 
---
Heck, add some new bonus achievements for old bosses; completing them (and CM's) without anyone dying or even going down, for avoiding all of x mechanic or executing y mechanic perfectly. Screw it, add in some low man achievements (6-8 players) and a little sprinkle of speed in there aswell for full squad performance-based achievements.
---
A new wing comes out? You gotta go and earn your title again and it's not something you can earn in a fucking evening.
---
There's tons of ways they can give us new heights to reach for in raids while adding a lot of extra replayability with just a few achievements and a title. The stuff I mentioned is barely scratching the surface, I could go on for hours about this crap but let's not kid ourselves and think any of it is ever going to happen.
---
you weren't requesting information, you straight up wrote:
---
&gt; gw2efficiency has a ton of inactive users on it.
---
you were set straight in that regard, there is no doubt about it.
---
not really if you look threw the comment you can see a have posted on exchange saying its fine, and i'm not changing the subject i didn't break any rules if i did they can say it in the mails not say the rule that was broken was RMT
---
I wasn't really active on reddit during the first year but things weren't that hostile as far as I remember. Nowadays people are lurking for anet's next misstep and criticizing the company decisions with multiple popular posts per release.
---
What, 30% of the users being inactive isn't a ton?
---
lets be honest here, MO wouldnt have started to think about other opportunities if everything was great at anet.  
---
anet and gw2 was his baby, he created it.  
---
you dont leave something like that unless youre seriously dissatisfied.
---
i once abussed this, there was a wvw player on map chat that jept swearing with cancer and trolling the server and just being a dick, after numoures reports from players of our server and video's to anet support nothing happend so i just went to pvpbank.com spent 20 euros and got his ass banned 
---
yes i abussed the system and played my own judge but it  anet didn't take any action for serveral months. i never regretted it and i would do it again to the same person if i had to.
---
Yeah but in this case they're also jailing the person who brought the fake cash in. 😅
---
I would ask for compensation for the gold and the flag removed  or just quit the game. This is just terrible customer service. You have the evidence why is there a problem? There’s no excuse for this.
---
I bought the official ones.
---
(I have 9x storage and 6x build and 6x gears).
---
Feeling a bit scammed TBH...
---
you're the one negatively impacting the game by trading outside of the market. you can't expect them to support it at all. play legit and stay inside the rules.
---
Alt-F4 is the universal windows hotkey for "immediately close this program".
---
Send in a support ticket with the same details otherwise Anet will believe everything is working as intended. And maybe it is.
---
Alt+F4 is a native windows-explorer short-cut to close a window.  You should avoid using alt with F4; use control or shift or anything else as a modifier..
---
I mean if you’re paying $60 and $15 a month, you ARE paying for build templates lol
---
i refuse to believe this is not a troll post
---
&gt; *alt + f4*
---
really?
---
*cough* Emblazoned Dragon Throne *cough*
---
Are you asking why a program closes when you press Alt+F4?
---
Not the point, they gave the ban for something i dident do. If a dev would say i got banned for useing gw2 exchange then fair my fault but they said someone broke RMT (not explaing who) but i get blamed becouse i was the last person the infusion got too
---
And banned players that did nothing wrong, because of course their detection system was as buggy as everything else (an empty string was interpreted as "malicious" and thus bannable).
---
It hasn't back fired though, look at what Anet are doing, they are ignoring the problem, not a single reply on all the apparent feedback, most other companies would have stopped the ability to buy the upgrades etc, until a solution was sorted, Anet on the other hand, bury their heads in the sand and hide behind a fake feedback request topic, which will probably be locked anyday now for being off topic, or if it doesnt go off topic, they leave the post alive long enough for the white knights to start fighting the non white knights then they lock it.
---
This isnt the first time they have done this either, anytime they do something that blows up like this, they just hide away and go super silent mode until enough time passes where they can do, oh well to late now, onto the next PR nightmare, i really dont get how they can just blindly continue as it nothing is happening.
---
if you spent any of that platinum and it gets removed then it puts you into the negatives but you also have literally no way of knowing that platinum was fraudulent and, at least back when I still played, people could just send you gifts that you literally couldn't deny because the game just accepted it as soon as you clicked on the gift so someone could straigth up get you banned
---
&gt;WvW-commanders and other community-figures basically live with a potential disaster waiting to happen above their head all the time. As a commander I got a couple of bigger donations and every time there is this small feeling of fear that I might get gold from a bad apple or I might even get trolled on purpose with it.
---
Didn't that *actually happen* a few times?
---
&gt;  and dropped ecto to about 20 silver. 
---
ectos are what, 19 silver now? The irony...
---
Actually the changes to Rampage is for PvP Only it's listed as a change in WvW if you didn't chance that and in PvP what happens alot with players using Rampage is they take advantage of in maps where it is harder to kite someone because choke points etc or they catch some when they are backed into a small space.
---
&gt; Nowhere in that post does it state that your acc will be flagged for RMT and given a temp ban if the other guy turns out to have been using RMT.
---
And I didnt claim it did. I mostly posted it because she mentions some reasons why they cant just duplicate items or gold when someone is being scammed and that trades outside the tp cannot be endorsed by Anet.
---
Thanks for agreeing with me that Ruby is eating all of the content.
---
These changes are only applied to PvP not WvW , the WvW changes are a different post with different changes
---
and don't forget, there are lots of other teams through which you can donate to extra life!
---
"We love feedback... The gem feedbacks". That shit got me hard. I love this meme.
---
I believe alt-f4 is the only problematic one, the rest should be fine. 
---
You're getting downvoted because people believe you're trolling, i think. Tricking people into, or being tricked into hitting alt-f4 has been a running gag for over 30 years at this point. It's almost unbelievable that anyone that uses a computer, especially someone savvy enough to be a PC gamer and be a reddit user, wouldn't know literally the most well-known keyboard shortcut or the prank of tricking people into using it.
---
&gt; Edit: I correct myself. If you have thousands of WvW levels then you're a beast.
---
Assuming those levels weren't earned back when you could farm XP in EoTM.  That is why Diamond Legend isn't impressive to me, since only the other player knows how they got it.
---
App is short for Application, and is not capitalized (it's not an acronym).
---
Also, Anet has confirmed many times over the years that GW2Exchange is allowed and OK to use. The risk you are citing comes from other players doing fraudulent trades, not a risk that your account could be banned.
---
Just use your numpad keys
---
Well... the event itself is tomorrow, but I doubt they would want to get people into the office on a weekend, so make total sense to have it today.
---
When it comes to defending something it is pretty easy to fall into the trap of only asking "is there a work around?" and ignoring "should a work around even be necessary?"
---
Nope.
---
That's still bull shit. If you spent that platinum, why remove platinum you DON'T have? Just remove what ever it is you purchased with it.
---
It's a stupid system.
---
My keyboard doesnt have a numpad (i bought it to play overwatch and the extra pad space was worth)
---
probably yes, not really sure, if the listed and the sold item are actually the same (and could hold some hidden info on previous owners) or if they get basically destroyed, once you list them and when someone buys your listing , a duplicate of that items is being put into the pick up tab.
---
Did Anet ever mention if its one way or the other?
---
Anyways, I am not really sure which one of my points you are arguing here.
---
Hypothetically speaking. What if you could trade it on the TP and it were involved in RMT. Would they still ban someone?
---
Fair enough; I've seen previously others using md5sums to track their versions, but plugin names work as well. I'll have to change some stuff up in the updater code but should be able to get this to work. Thanks for the help!
---
While leveling you should learn to use them all
---
That's a pretty damn good question.
---
I just don't enjoy MMO's anymore.  I've realized that it's just time to let GW2 go.  I'll still login and enjoy an episode here or there, do FoTM or raid weekly with friends, but my emotional investment is sunk.
---
If gold isn't a currency, trading it to someone isn't buying something
---
Because they have nothing.
---
Funny that you'd say that. I think exactly the same about WvW "commanders". 7+ years of fairweather casuals not sticking to the tag or joining comms and you'd think they start taking that into account. Instead they still throw a hissy fit about it.
---
First thing I always did when commandeering was to do a few checks so I knew what I worked with.
---
"Okay people, everyone awake and listening now moves a bit to the left, please! ...two...five...ah, now, let's see ... twelve! Not bad." *starts running with his zerg of 37*
---
No fucking clue what's so hard about that.
---
Its what I use on my weekly key toon.  Two-Blade Pete just melts lol.
---
One of these days i expect the NPC to walk into the Tavern and just hand me a BL Key.
---
Has the vision for GW2 ever been anything besides "yes to everything"?
---
What? Seriously?
---
Nope. Won't happen.
---
First of all, that's something different than OP's case. Anet accessed his account to deleted the **item he traded**, only then temp-banned him for 18 hours.
---
If someone simply sents RMT gold to you, it will be taken away from you, but you will never receive a ban for that. Anet even officially pointed that out.
---
Technically it's bartering. But in terms of real world, GW2 gold isn't a recognized currency. It's a good that can be purchased.
---
Is spelling really that hard or are you that eager to hammer out such an inane comment?
---
&gt; Its like Anet has become so unwieldy to not be able to re-work a feature last minute
---
Most people won't be able to deal with last minute changes for a lot of stuff.
---
The more surprising thing is that they don't seem to have anything prepared to respond to the potential backlash. If you see people going towards your house with pitchforks and torches it makes sense to get your firehoses prepared ...
---
Easy enough to pull this off using different IPs
---
Small help for you

---
WTF?
---
Finally a post that is not about build templates.  Here's my up vote.
---
Yeah of course, but I think such a revamp is made harder by nerfing core engi elements just to solve issues with holosmith.
---
Yeah, it was pretty clear to those affected early-on that John Smith was playing darts with his market balancing.  Took a while for the majority of dev-aware players to catch on.
---
yeah it is awful, DE has always been known for awful support
---
Prologue to me was very "meh" because when I look it is mostly just a pile of grindy achievements. Some people might like that but its definitely not my cup of tea. Was the story good? bad? 🤷‍♂️ All I can say for that is "unmoved".
---
For me a meaningful reward would be something that helps my character grow in someway. Because of gw2 horizontal progression; i never felt all that good when i saw an ascended chest drop, which is an excellent drop, because i have no more use for those.
---
I gave the isuue as mcuh attentiom, as it desevres, typin with my keybroad under the tsble.
---
Let's be honest, if it was "the final cash in games" and GW2 was going into maintenance mode like you doom and gloom guys like to say, then The Icebrood Saga wouldn't be a thing.
---
There's a time and place to be this way, this isn't the time or the thread. Take it elsewhere please.  This is for charity and the kids.
---
I hate companies with 0 tolerance policies.
---
It's just a way for them to do less work because their word is final.
---
This is when video games stop feeling organic and more like cash cows we know today.
---
I knew this ship sailed once the core members of the team left and I don't blame them.
---
Made me chuckle, good one.
---
You stupid fool! You absolute buffoon! Cow poop tastes way worse than horse poop. To suggest otherwise says a lot about you.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9d7orp/how_to_get_someone_banned_for_less_than_3/
---
What’s this meme and why does it apply here?
---
I am with you kdebones, the day when anet start to ban ppl for buying karma 21 items, that day I promise to leave this game because anet dev doesnt care about the playerbase, Right now only focus in gemstore, so the way they handle the situation about the layoff was the detonant to quit this game because this game is not good for you health. playing 24/365 and no get any items super nice is just a slavery.
---
Well, we have this futuristic and totally not used around the fucking world technology called "patch test realms/servers". I know it sounds farfetched, but they let you - get this - *test game builds* without affecting main servers in any way, *and* due to being open for players to join, you can accurately measure both strain on servers, along with having hundreds of people to test the game for potential bugs.
---
No, because the frequency of purchases is inversely related to the price, so it doesn't mean the same number of transactions are taking place at all price levels. You would need to have at least half as many people buying for 20k to delete the same amount of gold at 10k, but since the demand for luxury items is elastic, it's pretty much never going to be that high. Raising the price of some infusion from 10k to 20k knocks most people out of the demand curve, certainly much more than half of them.
---
This is true even if you were to raise the cap to 15k or some other value. You're always going to get less total gold flowing through the Trading Post and being deleted, because demand always drops faster than you can raise the price.
---
Not when it comes to GW2, methinks. You have to adjust your expectations to the level of competence usually displayed by ANet.
---
The engine is unoptimized for today's systems, that's true. 
---
OP's case however is different in that there's no way to get the performance he gets with the hardware he has, indicating very clearly that there's a glitch or misconfiguration somewhere with his system that's slowing GW2 down way more than is normal.
---
Then essentially saying "engine is bad, nothing you can do" is in fact misinformation.
---
Notepad.exe
---
if trading usimg INGAME mail system was forbidden, they would simply have deleted it..... They havent, so this must speaks of something
---
&gt;you do the bare minimum to get a MVP (minimal viable product) and squeeze what money you can out of that until it shuts down
---
This. I am almost sure we are in this stage of the game. 
---
They must have something else, some other game coming (Icebrood Saga is EotN of gw2). If they don't then everything is even worse than we think.
---
You are telling the probem yourself. The infusion was purchased with RMT by someone else and it ended in your hands. Basically what anet tells you is to get your purchases from TP if you want to be safe.
---
The most troublesome about this is that items you receive by mail (be it a present or whatever) can have the same problem. Better to refuse any expensive item you receive by mail if you can't completely trust the source of it.
---
We just established that if flags the account for RMT still.  Guess what happens if an account flagged for RMT gets caught for RMT again?  All this means is you just need to send to the account more than once.
---
I'm assuming that. Basing on the current release schedules, we're not getting a new raid in at least a few months. And fractal cms aren't even on the table. Not to mention the fact that the main fractal guy left.
---
somehow i get the impression that you arent a lawyer.
---
The biggest hurdle you will face in your endeavor to justice is that the EU (and probably every other nation or multilateral trade union) hasnt really adopted many policies on (the trade of) digital goods and services into law because those are relatively new commercial goods and services, which only started to grow substantially in value in the last 5-10 years.
---
That's a really terrible analogy. A better one would be if the feds came and repossessed your car, because someone who owned that car at some point had bought it with money from a bank robbery. 
---
The item was legitimate, the gold you used to buy it was legitimate, and you followed the ToS in every way. You should be cool right ? But instead of going after the person who robbed the bank, they just nick your car. 
---
It seems like they are doing this to remove ill gotten gold from the economy right ? Remove the item from circulation and you just took out however much gold from the economy and rebalanced it after an imbalance was caused, and it's all good ... but no imbalance was caused. No fake money was injected into the system. As far as the economy is concerned, some idiot send someone a whole bunch of money for no reason, just a transfer, no injection ... so why are they removing the item ? They're pulling money out that was never actually put in, and they're pulling the money from some guy who bought a car from a 2nd hand dealer because the guy who sold it to the dealer bought it with laundered cash. It makes literally no sense at all. 
---
Real money trading doesn't affect the economy in any real way. It's only against ToS because it's through third parties and not through Anet who should be making profits off of it. Removing items that were bought with RMT makes no sense in the first place. It makes even less sense to remove them from some guy who had literally no hand in it and just happened to get the unlucky item instead of the one right next to it that is totally fine. It's dumb.
---
Uhh the OP started this, not this guy.
---
Waste of breath
---
yeah, I understand that, I just linked the post as additional information on Anets stance about trading on the exchange and that info wasnt specifically targeted at OP but everybody.
---
They are two separate counters. One is for donations directly through the extra life site, the other is probably an automated in-game counter that goes up by random amounts within certain ranges at fixed intervals.
---
Whether players actually donate enough or not in-game, they'll likely make up for the rest anyways.
---
They likely choose to go for 50K because that's the amount they could afford for this.
---
If they didn't, it would look rather bad.
---
But at the end of the day what matters is that the money gets donated for a good cause.
---
I wouldn't count on it, with the extremely large volume of trades he does I assume they might have flagged him in some whitelist.
---
I just had a lot of templates because I had fun trying all sorts of random shit. And that's why I play videogames: for fun. I haven't played in months but it looks like if ArcDPS is banned the game has literally gotten worse over time. :(
---
The bigger problem at hand is that some items are worth 20,000 gold but the TP caps out at 10,000.  most people are OK with 15% tax.  not as many would be OK with having to pay 57.5%.
---
Well create a new toon for each game modes like you do with builds and you don't have problems.
---
gemstore is fine soo , there are no problem , the game is perfect , no bug , no content , no everything but gemstore...
---
noone else has have had any problems and the last sale was a while back if that is the problem they should would of mentiond it in the mail not blame it on the infusion.
---
The prologue?
---
Oh boy. I actually hope they give us the thing. I actually like the story
---
Madoooooo!! Commanderooooo
---
ANet hasn't confired it's without risk. They have only confirmed they won't ban you for trading through the mail, but that to avoid scams and other problems you should use the TP, and if you don't it's at your own risk. 
---
They may take actions against a scammer, but they won't return anything lost to them.
---
Engi is carried by its elite specs. Core class is bad and abandoned by devs, and can't compare to other specs. No proper reworks and nerfing of core to nerf elite specs lead to where it is now - convoluted trait lines without clear focus (Explosives and Firearms), useless utility skills (turrets), skills untouched for YEARS (kits). It's clear balance team has no idea what to do with core engineer and it pushes me away from the game, while stuff like necro and warrior are getting constant interesting reworks, new machanics and all the attention.
---
Are you talking about [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7aai2h/can_i_send_500g_to_my_buddyies_without_getting/)
---
Because in there he actually says that you *will* get flagged if you ever receive gold originating from RMT.  And the only response to a question of "what if you don't know the source is RMT" is remarks about such a scenario could never possibly happen.  Which guess what, said scenario did just happen with Op, just with a middleman via the chak infusion.
---
We also never established getting sent gold from RMT as opposed to getting sent an item originating for RMT trading is treated an differently.
---
Yeah its confusing. I think the livestream one is the Arenanet team so the company, the donation page is the Arenanet superteam so that includes other streamers. Finally I think the in game donations is added up from buying the bundle and karma boosters but I could be wrong.
---
It's a huge feature that has been taking years at this point. For a long time it has been suspected it had very little man power going into it, but recently it sounds like more is being devoted to it. It remains to be seen if that is true or not.
---
I've learned some of the techniques through some marketing material I read through a while ago, and yeah, it's not very honest,and that's what gets to me the most. If I had a business, I'd like to do my best to be honest and sell value at the right price.
---
This also ties into things line mlm/pyramid schemes. Literally the most predatory, but instead of spending money on a lot box to maybe get a Shiny, you spend your life savings on a promise of retiring easily. There's some infographics and websites outlining the earnings and spendings from a lot of those 'companies', and in like 99% cases, they lose money, or earn waaaaay less than minimum wage.
---
I'm glad you've come to terms with it and how it affects you though. Good on you for realizing that it's not worth it! 
---
I'll have a look into Jim Stirling too, sounds interesting.
---
&gt; As far as the ban i tought it would be longer too but it was 18 hrs.
---
thats why i tried to explain that you werent banned, access to your account was just blocked, so they have time to investigate. 
---
This can also happen to totally innocent players and its a measure to protect them, for example if their account is accessed/compromised from an unusual IP and the person using it suddenly starts liquidating all their assets. IF something like that is flagged by the system, access to the account is blocked to anybody (expect GMs obviously) until the right owner will contact support and proof of ownership can be submitted and the right owner determined.
---
&gt; i value my account a lot i have been playing since beta so i dont want anything to effect it
---
I do get your sentiment, its the same for me. 
---
When I was a mod of the exchange I only acted as middleman for trades via one of my own guild banks, never via mail. Because that way, my personal account would never be in possession of any of the items traded and I wouldnt run the risk of getting caught in the crossfire of a trade involving an item that was involved in rmt.
---
I also had both parties state in guild or party chat that none of the items or gold involved in the trade were paid for by RMT and that they have never been involved in RMT before.
---
I assumed that if push comes to shove and one trader was lying, those statements would prevent the other trader getting a ban too.
---
Not sure if you guys also made such statements before the trade, as i didnt watch the video.
---
I think thats getting the livestream goal to $100,000 but at $25,000 Anet will match that with another $25,000 taking it to $50,000. If I remember correctly there will be teasers at $22,000, $33,000, $44,000 but I could be wrong.
---
But that also gives players two really strong incentives to trade outside the TP. Both avoiding the 15% tax and getting an actual fair price for their ridiculously rare item. You can't simply impose a maximum price like this and say "nothing should ever be more expensive". It's not up to you to decide. It's not even up to the devs to do it. It's up to the market.
---
we did not state the RMT part no we just said how much the value was basically
---
How is tp is safe when they can ban anyone who ends up with real money bought stuff ? How much irl money bought gold is on the tp or in peoples hands? By theyr logic tehy should ban 90% of the playerbase.
---
It's weird that EVE isn't the only game with a TEST? Could have cleared up a lot of confusion if you had just asked if we were from EVE. 
---
TEST of GW2 was one of the the 'reddit' guilds at launch, and the home of a number of people from the EVE alliance with a similar name. It is and always will be an independent entity. Most of the EVE left - GW2 isn't what most EVE die hards are looking for.
---
I was talking about OPs issue and he got answers.
---
That seems to be the solution people are giving to those who feel their legendary armor has been devalued so why not in this case too?  Seems appropriate
---
yeah, i didnt want to imply that your ban had anything to do with raid selling, it was an off topic question I just asked because you mentioned that you have been selling raids, so I thought you might have more insight into that than me.
---
i haven't had any desire to play in weeks and although i'm still immensely in love with the story and the fan content, i can feel my interest fading. at this point i might just only play when new story content is released :(
---
Sadly "we know you aren't in the wrong, but enjoy your ban/flag anyways" has been an ANet staple.
---
I had a character with "God" in its name for years. Logged in one day to find I had been flagged for a name change... even though their rules had just changed to explicitly state names including Religious iconography/references were allowed.
---
Contacted support, pointed out the change in policy. My name was flagged before though so they refused to un-flag it.
---
Truly wonderful policies lol
---
I know :) i just meant that if that was the case and they come out with it now that would be ridiculous because i sent them many mails asking what's up and they never mentioned it
---
Not only do they promise to try and make it work, *they usually succeed*.
---
Here, take another one for the road; you are a complete monkey, please never be so cruel as to bring another life into this world.
---
No one said, "everything they did was right."  I mean, who are you talking to? If you mean me, I never once said that.  If you mean other people, then sure I guess you can call than fanboyism but none of that is going on with this post.
---
ok, well, maybe a best practice to implement for future trades (not for you obviously because I guess you wont do any trades like this anymore).
---
But on the other hand, I cant say that it would have definately prevented you getting an account flag as fortunately, none of my facilitated trades got flagged for RMT
---
You're welcome to me the time invested turned out great.  So, being slow isn't a bad thing being that you were able to produce this and you're welcome :D
---
In fairness, you can definitely love something but be ready to love it from afar/be less involved in it. You can love eating and making pizzas but if you're doing it every day for 10 years eventually you might wanna try a different food.
---
That said... none of these are "hey, I'm ready to try some new things and move on" vacancies. They're people who seemed emphatic about what they were making shortly before their departures. This isn't sailing into new horizons, it's rushing the life rafts.
---
nope never tradeing with anyone again xD
---
This tends to happen everytime Anet blunders. The community gets vocal, people point out how poorly the company is ran or reacts, everyone nods their heads.
---
Then Anet makes some sort of official statement and the whole thing is forgiven. If you continue to point out how poorly Anet is ran or reacts you get blasted by another vocal part of the community, and downvoted by the rest.
---
I've maintained the stance that this company does everything by the seat of their pants and never puts forethought into anything. They monetize everything they can get away with and never change. This company is a joke when compared to devs like Square or Blizz in terms of operations.
---
Hearing talk about mirage cloak makes me nervous for them to ruin the last class I really like across the board, just as they did with Chrono. With things the way they are going, mesmers are going to be back in 2012; and I simply won’t do it.
---
I'm going to clarify as I made that other reddit post at $100,000 the devs on stream said they will give us the episode name, release date and a teaser not the actual trailer.
---
I swear anet could literally kill a child and people like you would find a way to justify it. Anet blows and the game is dead, accept it.
---
I am wondering if you only traded for the CES on the exchange (because you cant buy it on the tp) or used it for other trades before that as well.
---
"I'm rich, you know."
---
Bought 1 peerless infusion after
---
And bought some of the mystic coins that were used in the trade very few thou
---
lol oh boy. what a joke. I know it's for charity and all but ffs.
---
It truly is a great concept.
---
What's also great is that you still gain XP at max lvl, be it either for masteries or some crafting stuff.
---
Either way, even at max lvl it's still worth it doing events, dungeons etc. Compared to "normal" MMORPGs like WoW it's a revolutionary system...although it's already 6-7 years old :D
---
That's very *in* character for Dornsinger.
---
I don't get how anyone could waste 1k gold for this title.
---
I doubt fractals will get a lot of attention now that ben is gone.
---
I mean... I'm glad this money is gonna help people and all but... you know the company sucks at PR when the reward for donating is giving information they should be giving nontheless... It even means they have already something to tease.
---
In 7 years "we as players need to let Arena net know that we want them to care more about it" but arena net cares not.
---
It's completely different than before. While Anet was developing a new campaign for GW1 (Utopia) they realized that what they really wanted to do is develop a sequel, GW2. They told us exactly that before EoTN was released. But now, Anet keeps us in the dark, we don't know what the future holds.
---
Don't you think we could do something if we make enough noice? Forums, reddit and such?
---
Laughed till my head hurt
---
They are not going to revamp the engine or try to optimize anything, shit is breaking enough already as it is.
---
It also integrates better in game, the dialog boxes are more natural, it isn't trying to draw over the game screen like tac0.
---
Anet trying to restore their image with charity...
---
They're been doing this shit every year for a while now and it was obviously planned long before this release. 
---
I get that we all have a bone to pick with ArenaNet right now, but can we knock off the Olympic levels of stupidity and clearly not knowing how the world functions?
---
This is why I said there are two strong incentives. I didn't mean the TP cap creates them both, I meant the way the TP is set up does. Both the market tax and the cap. It is a flawed system.
---
LOL, now their schtick is holding content behind a charity paywall? Cool...
---
There was a time when grindy achievements were my cup of tea, but anet themselves killed that for me over the course of LWS4.  If the current episode is indicative of future direction I'm probably done - I still do dailies but they aren't a priority for me anymore.  I have a ton of alts but map completion is all I use them for anymore.
---
`\Guild Wars 2\addons\arcdps\arcdps.buildpad\config.ini`

My company kept piling up on a 20yo structure up until one of the founders quit over frustration from technical limitations. Now the remaining one is trying to lead a major overhaul which has been a mess : we still need new developments for customers which means the dev team basically has to work double. In 5 years we haven’t seen shit from the new system and the old one suffers bad releases because they don’t have the time to do it proper anymore. And I t’s just a 50dev soft we’re talking about, I don’t even wanna ear about the nightmare for a MMO
---
They should just give that info out regardless
---
You must not be rich. Go back to eating your peanut butter and potato sandwich, peasant.
---
No, because that was done for a long time again and again already.
---
You also shouldn't need to spend 1200 USD for a computer in the first place. My laptop only cost me 800 USD, came with 12gb RAM, integrated dedicated graphics card with 4gb of vRAM, a 150gb SSD and a 1Tb HDD and a 1080p resolution widescreen monitor.
---
I run GW 2 at max settings, not at 60fps, and I can minimize and multitask. I've played Sekiro, OW at near ultra, it runs pretty damn well Code Vein, etc. 
---
Just to give you the technical information, my graphics card is an Nvidia GeForce GTX 950M, and my CPU is an Intel Core i5-7200U. Nothing too powerful.
---
I think they will by begin of the next week thhhuesday or monday.
---
&gt;but when i hotkey the 2nd for f4 my game crashes to desktop
---
Alt-F4 has been the universal Windows OS shortcut for "immediately close this app" for a very long time. If not a troll post, well everyone learns this the hard way at some point.
---
I think it's safe to say they will give that out regardless. They're just offering to do it early as a little incentive for donations, it's not a big deal.
---
The concert proved there's a lot of life left in the open world event design framework.  I'm on the fence about Cooking 500 - the collection and leveling were really well implemented but the grind to produce ascended precursor material.... makes ignored food useful, I guess, but adds a lot of steps.
---
&gt; So, your solution for anet removing a useful feature of 7 years is to give them money and buy additional character slots in order to replicate the useful feature?
---
The solution is that we should punish EANet for driving the QOL actually down by not buying a damn thing.
---
meh, could be my poor attitude today but it feels a bit crappy
---
Yeah thats basically how it tends to work out. Worst case, you end up like the banks, with several critical systems relying on a codebase written in a coding language a handful of people in the entire world know.
---
Nope, this was not the one.
---
I'm talking about an official statement by an Anet dev on reddit or the forums that had its own thread I think.
---
It was a reaction to the second thread you link, and several other similar ones.
---
&gt; We also never established getting sent gold from RMT as opposed to getting sent an item originating for RMT trading is treated an differently.
---
...but that was literally the premise I mentioned and based my original response on to which you replied
---
If by "meaty update" you mean equipment-treadmill and grindfest, then yeah
---
tp is safe because you are not purchasing the exact item the seller posted for sale but just the generic item that meets the properties.
---
SoO for example if someone listed a chak egg infusion purchased with RMT the player who purchases it will not receive the exact item but a the generic item that shares the same properties of the one listed, in this example a chak egg infusion with +5 to the same attribute the seller posted.
---
Yeah, the grass is always greener on the other side...
---
Because people stopped investing into GW1 after they announced GW2. It makes sense for them to keep us in the dark because then people keep spending money on it until the last minute.
---
One problem is that the pricing of gear loadouts (because yeah, they're not actually templates) is that the gem price is only worth it IF you're using completely separate sets of gear for each loadout.  If you have any gear shared between loadouts, you're essentially paying extra gems for storage space that you're not using.  And this hits doubly hard for those that were dedicated enough to get legendary equipment, since the stat swap functionality seems to be borked.
---
These are goals that make players keep playing over years. Some people like gear treadmill in WoW, some like opening 10000 ToT bags in GW2. Fundamentally, it's just repeatable grind painted differently.
---
The first few times it takes a while to load assets but that goes away. Also portraits and previews are a bit bugged and it has crashed once or twice, but otherwise all good.
---
GW2 has its own problems with narrative aswell. Scarlet, Taimi, Rytlock's absence. Just to mention a few.
---
except shocking aura is almost entirely passive
---
works for multiple hits
---
can affected essentially infinite targets
---
if the shocking aura disappears after one hit then maybe

After Fallout 4 recycled Fallout 3 - beat for beat, point for point in some places - I realized Skyrim iterating on Oblivion wasn't a fluke and that the next Bethesda game is going to be more of the same.  I think I've had my fill of their sub-genre.  Though as [Enderal](https://store.steampowered.com/app/933480/Enderal_Forgotten_Stories/) proves, a great RPG is entirely possible with Bethesda's engine and assets - it just won't be written or published by them.
---
and my post was about a general point so ????

&gt; We want to acknowledge that we are reading the feedback expressed in this thread and the other forums threads about the Build and Equipment Templates. We are discussing this feedback internally to determine how we can address it.
---
Thanks, was wondering why it took so long to render. Hope it goes away. Cheers mate!
---
 [https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy](https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy)  &lt;-- This works like a charm for me.
---
But dont you think a template functionality would offset that problem and turn gear loadouts into a more fancy inventory space? For people like me that are OCD nuts?
---
nothing is off the table
---
I guess we lost that then again... now Im sad.
---
Desktop. But used this:  [https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy](https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy) 
---
And it does not lag anymore.
---
I'm not speaking grammatically, I'm saying that they are treating the problems as a passively occurring event instead of an actively caused one, which they clearly are.
---
I love support, its not your fault how the item travels, you lose your gold, item and a ban. But we can all pay for templates ;) Hey Anet can you fuck off and sell the franchise to people who actually care about the game and community? You prove time and time again that gw2 is becoming less attention worthy in the MMO world. Fucking step up or step out
---
Well I hope you whiners are happy now.
---
I don't usually comment on these things but it seems unsual that they got feedback from the community prior to the update but changed absolutely nothing. I don't think the trust is still there to believe they're actually listening.
---
&lt;.&lt;
---
Why you hate teh s’s?
---
What did they do to you?
---
Well "celestial" ele is a thing for PvP/WvW Roaming  
---
besides that it's a dps spec that can drop conjures for relevant dps specs *shrug*
---
So outside pvp ele is poo lol
---
WoW is pure shit. Tbh there’s only one MMO we could be jealous of (not speaking about specific contents but just about how the game is handled, the communication around the game, ...) and that’s FFXIV.
---
Blizzard deserves shit.
---
Well I mean all side projects were kinda cancelled. If a sequel were under there, that then means it was cancelled as well
---
You are free to express your opinion.  I am free not to read it.  The fact that upgradws have a super inflated price is something objective and indisputable.
---
I've said before, but frankly what they should've done here is give a separate inventory called the armoury (they've stated this is internally what they call the hidden inventory for everything that's currently equipped or in another loadout tab).  So make the armoury visible, let us add gear directly to the armoury, then the loadout/template tabs can pull directly from the armoury (and we could actually save templates instead of loadouts as long as the gear used in said template was still in the armoury).  Then you sell new template/loadout tabs for relatively cheap, while selling more armoury space as well.  Bonus is that players that only need to make slight tweaks or use legendary gear don't need as much armoury space, but can buy the loadout tabs, and those that only need 2-3 builds, but want gear that's fully different from each other can keep the tabs to a minimum, and purchase armoury space instead.
---
&gt; On a sidenote: I'll never tire of freak bugs happening because they moved a chair somewhere a bit to the right, causing Tequatl to spawn in Lion's Arch or something.
---
Neither will I. That kind of stuff is amusing to say the least.
---
This could have been made way better. It only adresses the price "issue" (which I dont agree on) and does not adress any of the other issues. And its way too long imo cause it just keeps repeating same stuff.
---
Well yeah it's a prologue, not a full episode. Of course it was short. It was still well received and the map still has plenty of people on it. The quality of a story is subjective and lots of people liked it even if you didn't. And it was free, don't forget that either.
---
How to proceed: Actually give us build and equipment templates.
---
Commanders help keep the game alive.
---
That’s a short term fix, really. But better than what we have.
---
OH MY GOD THIS MAN JUST WON THE INTERNET
---
You don't buy build templates with money, you buy gems with money. It's a huge difference.They don't have to refund any real money if they do something like that, just send the gem difference to the people that bought em.
---
Hopefully Anet addresses the feedback in a satisfactory way.  I was on the verge of very reluctantly buying four Equipment Templates, when out of curiosity I looked into how much money I've spent on this game over the years.  Turns out I've spent an average of $62 per month, which is insane.  Doesn't feel like a lot of money when you spend here and there, but it really adds up.  I will not be spending a dime on a basic UI function that I've always had for free with ArcDPS.  And, in general, I think I'm going to back away from the gem store for a while lol.
---
Literally comparing revenues, Anet is far from what FFXIV makes and also... 
---
a B2P should be judged more with f2p than p2p, now I want someone to point me a f2p or b2p game with free templates included ingame and I'm not talking GW1... At the end GW1 isn't a proper mmo doesn't matter how you painted, is a multiplayer dungeon crawler and MHW, GE franchise and CV have templates but are more similar in game style to GW than GW2.
---
If i want to bitch about something will be bank space, because on my old mmo the minimun space was 300 and after an update went 600... oh wait that was because went f2p on december 2007 and used to be a sub only game./s
---
Literally, comparing games that get a minimun revenue goal each month against game where revenue is super volatil, different monetization and other stuff needs to be done considering all the singularities about publishing and revenue models. 
---
Now about CR, CS and PR (handling of problems) FFXIV is clearly ahead but that is not the theme in this post.
---
mate you absolutely have no fucking clue how this shit works in real life
---
Properly written bitfield code is easily maintainable.  Embed the pragmas  you need and the module doesn't break.
---
I don't mind having to pay for the equipment tabs, they are basically extra bag space which we already pay for, but charging for the build storage, and template is just ridiculous.
---
What you're looking for is a timer site. Type event timer into the Guild Wars 2 wiki and learn when that boss spawns. Show up five minutes early and people will be there. It really is that easy.
---
I prefer gw2timer.com personally but it's a bit harder to follow when you start.
---
I'm mainly complaining more about how they did it in terms of enjoyability, since while making a class less powerful yet still enjoyable is at least understandable, making it annoying to play is terrible no matter how powerful it is afterwards. I agree with you that Chrono's been made unviable in most modes, I just didn't speak on that specifically since after the change, I mostly just tried Chrono in open world and raids (a bit of other modes, but just a little bit) before I decided it was too painful to play now, and I didn't want to talk about modes I didn't have much post-change Chrono experience in.
---
/wiki et type it in game.
---
they're not gonna do anything lmao
---
It has happened in many cases that drugs get sent to an address and are hoped to just be left on the doorstep for the actual recipient to grab.
---
Then shit hits the fan when the police are tracking that package to the guy it's been SENT to.
---
You're the one negatively impacting this subreddit with your inability to read but your enthusiasm to jump in and spout bullshit lmao
---
Sorry but why did you do the video ?
---
On that front they haven't been all that great either.  There are too many one time purchases which limits spending ...
---
&gt; next time dont trust souls.
---
next time **read the fucking post** before allowing yourself to fall into the delusion that anybody wants to hear what you have to say.
---
Blizzard has had far more layoffs and bad press than Anet this year. That's not counting subjectively y bad content releases.
---
Last minutes changes can be difficult to squeeze in but all they had to do was post pretty much this exact same message on Tuesday instead of Friday.
---
this is the case of reusing assets and nothing else
---
Thank you, but the event timer is not what im looking for.
---
&gt; I've always felt, that if you have to make a rule against something, you have a flawed system and you should fix the system so people don't even want to do that thing in the first place instead of making the rule. 
---
Agreed, they should remove the player to player mail system and increase the maximum sell value on the TP.
---
Is anyone actually Anet to change anything?
---
I'm not holding my breath.
---
They should either make a real build template like the one Delta made and actually allow the players to have advantage with it, not like now that they basically removed WvW and PvP builds and placed it there for universal use OR if they dont want to make a real build template function then allow using the Delta build template, because what the Delta one did and what this does is almost like 2 separate things.
---
I mean, even if they leave it like it is now and allow the Delta template worst case scenario people would use BOTH, and some people who didnt used Delta´s templates till now will use the build in one anyway. I see no reason to play this idiot game of "We dont allow anything 3rd party because we have a built-in thing and we also need money"
---
Lets say it out, the in game templates are badly desinged, they dont even work normally, they even deleted some player´s gear and they also break the whole game...
---
And to top it all off, they say they were working on this for 2yrs... I mean, working on what? How to break the servers with an UI update?
---
No wonder that the whole GW2 community is memeing, asking for money for a tool that actually makes players to be afraid of playing the game is really the best idea
---
I have at least 2 grand spent, its crazy how it adds up.
---
But even if you, lets say buy 10k gold with gems, you wont get the item, because its so rare that there is on average 1 drop per month and you arent the only one that want it.
---
Considering the number of times some one has come on here complaining about a supposedly unjustified ban only for it to come out that the OP wasn't telling the whole story and wasn't actually banned for what they claimed, I'm giving this instance like a 90% chance OP isn't telling the whole story.
---
It boils down to probabilities. Most people won't use a VPN and would get caught. Anet for sure also has more data than just IPs (like which windows system/version etc.). If you use two different physical PCs you might get away. But most people would get caught. That's what matters, not the 1% which get away.
---
Afaik is Anet also banning all accounts of botters/RMT traders etc. Apparently are they able to figure this out.
---
Price is an issue but functionality and limits are much bigger issues.
---
I believe in Anet.
---
What are you happy about? I ask only because am curious, tell me so we can be both happy about it
---
Which is why new Vegas is so good, it has actual writers behind it.
---
Is it time to increase template limit to 10 yet? The one "responce" for a legitimate issue I can see them implementing.
---
Ask for a senior GM. Escslate this, it's absolute bullshit.
---
He's got -100 post karma and has a fucking flair on how many whiner's he's "logiced". Holy fuck, how insecure and delusional can you be.
---
One of the developers confirmed on the forums that the riftstalkers are an alien race from the mists, enslaved by Kralk.
