Thank you! Sure, here you go:
---
* Dragon Horns
---
* Mantle of the Lich
---
* Vestments of the Lich
---
* Hellfire Vambraces
---
* Primitive Legwraps
---
* Genius Boots
---

---
Staff is Hydra Staff.
---
---
---
Why not both?
---
Commander lady's mail though!
---
Well I have 6 accounts, so your mileage might vary.
---
Once you have the nodes it's all profit.  Just need to buy the new LS node when it's available which generally makes it's money back after 4 months or so (for me)..
---
Less with multiple accounts (and 2 computers).
---
Nice combination! :)
---
Thank you very much!
---
Looks really good. I too like the plain, medieval look without all the bling and shiny effects.
---
Holo, but make sure to bring rifle + kits. You offer 25 vuln with that build, a *ton* of CC compared to soulbeast and sword holosmith, and the rifle 5 leap is one of the best mobility skills in Fractals. 
---
You never played silverwastes, don't you?
---
Nice !! Im getting  BALROG vibes from this. 
---
I thought I'd do the maths by crunching the event/zone data from the API.
---
Two images: (1) [Graph of events per zone](https://i.imgur.com/A7hQBgE.png) (2) [Graph of events per zone scaled by zone area](https://i.imgur.com/qPRXScD.png)
---
HOT maps seem alive and this is very much related to how dense the events area.
---
I'm actually surprised how many events there are in the POF maps - they feel devoid of events. Scaling them to the size of the area suggests they're similar event-per-area-intensity to the original core maps.
---
LWS4 is pathetic for event intensity and gives poor repeatability imo.
---
Yeah I actually had a hard time deciding about those two and just came to the conclusion I would swap it out once in a while as it only takes a minute &lt;3
---
although I think the sylvari is my favorite
---
gear stat isn't like "gotta catch them all", just pick whatever you need now..your first step is to have 1 functional character for whatever your goal is and yes, next ones will come easier
---
for fractals t4 you need full ascended everything, for raids you should have at least ascended weapons and trinkets and for wvw you can probably get by with just ascended trinkets
---
daredevil is fine in fractals, just don't use marauder gear..oh and unlock deadeye!
---
banner warrior uses power in fractals and very few raid encounters(the rest are condi)
---
now what would i do if i were you? i would gear my thief with proper power stuff because that's viable in more places
---
next i would have in mind a condition damage character for the few raid encounters that require it:desmina, largos, matthias and arguably cairn..i would suggest mirage because OP, condi soulbeast cuz easy or condi scourge(also pretty easy)
---
Also LF PR players. My username is Vrosh.6584

---
Playing an engineer is bad enough but a charr as well. Disgusting furry filth 
---
I have to warn you, you're going down the road to addiction to obsessive legendaries collection. 
---
As a heavy armor main it is time for me to take create my first legendary weapon. I like using all 3 heavies and I enjoy fractals and wvw. What legendary do you think I should make first?? 
---
LOL. Yeah. I totally was saying the shit I said here on your twitch chat lol. Funny as hell how sensitive you are . Shows how petty you can be when someone disagrees with you though haha. Nice to know that’s how you treat viewers who disagree with you. Instant ban them from stream when they didn’t even say a thing on your stream lol. People wouldn’t go in on you if  you didn’t make it so easy. I’ve had my fun now. Have fun lol 
---
I hope you sent over enough.  You need around 224 - 336 per account depending on the length of the festival.
---
This is amazing. Good job!
---
Hey man - I'm just now doing this with you!  Good luck!  FYI, I'm kinda at the pre-Aurora stage, where you need to complete the 4 token collection items first to unlock Gleam of Sentience. All I need to do it collect the last tokens in Chalice of Tears JP...
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
ugh.  Omg.  Not sure how far you've gone with this legendary, but just like you I'm pretty casual.  This JP is kicking my ass lol.  Dulfy has a decent video guide here: [http://dulfy.net/2016/09/21/gw2-chalice-of-tears-jumping-puzzle-guide/](http://dulfy.net/2016/09/21/gw2-chalice-of-tears-jumping-puzzle-guide/)
---
Good luck!  And let us know how it goes :) &lt;3 
---
Thanks!!
---
Kudos on putting together an endgame set for Fashion wars 2 that is not a walking disco ball. :) 
---
If ANet seeds a sudden drop in supply related to LNY, they make on the fly changes to what items are needed for w/e during the festival.
---
[What about](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Kralkachocolate_Bar)
---
Thats great to know, thanks!
---
Thanks!
---
On the bright side, I get to use Industry glyph on them (except for the garden plot). Makes the farm go by faster. 
---
If I'm not as lazy I use Unbound glyph, since I still have alts to gear. 
---
We need more of this
---
Really nice. Well tuned.
---
I usually DESPISE the light asc chest skin... but maybe that's just jealousy becuse I hate how it looks on males.
---
(Bellybutton free... really? You're litterally tailoring the best armor in the game for yourself and then make it look like it's two sizes too small... )
---
Wasn't it Steamed Red Dumplings last year?  I think they'll pick something different.  Probably an account bound item that you get a ton of for opening the envelopes.
---
How does that even have anything to do with my comment? I am talking about right now. Silverwastes right now is fun, new map right now is not fun. Simple logic.
---
Please Anet make one more exception like the Braham outfit, give us the shoulder or at least the visors.
---
THIS IS WICKED.
---
I was thinking 22nd, and it would end 2 days after, so around 16 days long.
---
Oh, thanks!! I've heard before about using a Marauder/Berserker hybrid, but I had no idea how to pull it off. Do you think it would be fine to build a Deadeye for Fractals tho? I'm afraid of being kinda unoptimal for T4, idk haha.
---
It has to do with it because Anything after Silverwastes went to shit.
---
Thanks!! I guess I might stick to Thief after all hehe.
---
Cool, ty
---
I'd gift you reddit gold if I wasnt pressed on bills. Thank you so much for this massive informative post!
---
Well it's true that not a lot of games have built-in 3D stereoscopy, but a lot of the ones that do are just kinda "meh" (Crysis 2 for example). But the way anet designed just about *everything* about the game tells you it was *designed* to be viewed in 3D.
---
For example, when you hit an enemy with condi damage and you have "show simple condition floaters" enabled, the condi damage numbers don't just jump out of the enemy, they jump out *in all directions*. You can't see that on a monitor, but in 3D it looks dope af.
---
Also, not only does the game have really great depth for viewing the vast lands and enormous structures in Tyria, but the pop-out man. The pop-out is really, *really* good. So natural, it just brings Tyria into your room. For example, follow your alt while they have a sword over their shoulder and you might find the edge of the blade a little too close to your face for comfort lol.
---
Like I said everything about this game is designed so it looks good in 3D. The Grove...I can't even describe it, you have to see it to believe it.
---
Which is why I stopped playing for over 2 years when I got my Vive in April '16. I wanted to be in Tyria so bad and the 3D holds out such amazing promise, but between the game not having a spectator mode like DOTA2 (if you haven't seen it, do NOT download DOTA2 and check out their VR mode. It will make you cry that GW2 doesn't have the same) and the lo-res of the Vive, GW2 just became too frustrating and VR too new and exciting.
---
It may be endgame content but stuff like Cairn, Overseer, VG &amp; Escort aren't DPS checks the same way that KC or CA are. 
---
The sort of attitude you preach isn't healthy for the mode as a whole.  You're right.  I wish more people came prepared, but it doesn't really do much good scaring off potential players and erecting a huge gate that they have to climb over before they can see the fights. 
---
There's almost always going to be someone that gets their build from SC, practices their rotation a little bit, but eats mechanics and isn't able to replicate their DPS in an actual raiding environment.  It's good to practice on the golem and build muscle memory, but nothing beats practical experience. Your attitude is pretty insufferable tbh.  It's like you've completely forgotten what it's like to have bad or inexperienced friends.  There's such a thing as patience, good-will and benevolence -- as if you've never been helped out.  
---
Most people do get carried through one boss at one time or another -- you build experience by progressively learning mechanics and when your mechanics are cleaner you have greater freedom to exercise your rotation.  That's raiding in any game.   
---
 
---
Most training groups that I've helped out are *progression* groups.  They're groups of friends that are gradually working together to become better at the game.  All this talk of kicking players for underperforming is toxic to the mode as a whole and preserves the bullshit idea that raids are this exclusive club that only "good" players are allowed to enjoy.  Fuck that.
---
Do you want raids to decline even more than they already have? You need to accept that all some people want to do is get their feet wet before they bite the bullet and start working on min/maxed gear and studying benchmarks.  No one is asking you to carry players; that's your own choice.  I'd much rather disband a training run than kick players.  I'd just end the session saying something like, "We made some good progress today and our mechanics have gotten much cleaner.  If you practice your DPS a bit you've got this!" 
---
It's pretty sad that you don't realize how elitist you've become.  You're probably one of the most inhospitable and unfriendly raiders that I've met on GW2.  When people meme about toxic elitism &amp; GW2 raiding they're talking about people like you that want inexperienced players to jump through half a dozen hoops before they're even allowed to cross the starting line.  
---
Looks great! 
---
If you prefer power build (core guard and DH), greatsword. It's much better for soloing open world or story stuff because of the higher cleave dps vs Scepter. 
---
I suggest starting on fractals. Exotic is mostly fine for Tier1 while ascended trinkets (Berserker) are easy enough to obtain via laurels. Your first ascended set will be slow and expensive. However, once you get high enough in fractals, you'd pretty much swim in ascended equips. 
---
Well I'm a KS backer so I should be getting mine some time in the next month. I believe a few months after that consumer preorders will start shipping. It could even be sooner, seems like Pimax is ramping up production.
---
Excellent! This is the true fashion endgame. No stupid auras, good coloring, fitting pieces. Immersion not gutted. 10/10.
---
What dyes are those?
---
They could do both. They just need to set up a proper normal one-time achievement set before we get an annual meta.
---
Hey I'm from India and I too have timezone issues. But I'll highly recommend fractals to get your trinkets. Bcoz I of time zone issues even I have problems but I managed to reach T4 by just puging. I'll say pick a professional u like and gear him up crazy! Read the discretize guide on fractals and watch deriors videos on YouTube or msg me too. I'd love to help! Good luck
---
for DD? You could run something like below, but I would advice it only in open world, if you wanted to move into WvW roaming replace the all the trinkets except the "earring rings" with marauder stats.  
---

Started working on this a few days after the release of LS4E4, didn't really turn out as I wanted at first so I put it aside for a while. Finally thought I was done procrastinating and decided to finish it up.

Beautiful! What's the leg and boot piece? I've tried something similar and failed XD

Lol same exact thing happened to me a few months ago

Conceptually yes, it was appropriate, but IMO the concept art for Zhaitan looked waaay better than the completely different design we got in game.

Some may feel otherwise, but I respectfully disagree :)

From the looks on Metabattle for Guardian WvW, many builds do use Hammer but thats enturely up yo your playstyle. but it works for all 3 professions.
---
I'm glad you do! 
---
I did. My whole mindset is that everything needs to work together, weapons included. I've been dying to get Onyx Lion Greatsword skin, since it really pops with the outfit (And I'm a Reaper) but it's locked to 2k gem skin packs so I went with mostly overlooked Privateer set which is easily obtained with Black Lion Ticket(s).

Totally with you on that last point... I think we can both agree that our recent rumbling with an Elder Dragon was a major improvement!

Can I have your gpu
---
You have to do it for all Mount skins
---
No
---
Like Core Tyria masteries?
---
The comments of this post are correct, sort of. This is a settings issue. First of all, depending on how you place target location skills. Some classes are good to place right on an object and others it's better to place in front of or ahead of a target. 
---
* If you're interested in placing directly on a target, you'll need to enable Location Snap. It's a button toggle in your settings. Location Snap will force your ground targets on any select object. 
---
* When using Target Location skills, you can also change how a skill is cast. By default, you'll select a skill (click or hotkey) and then the location marker will appear to choose your location. There are two other options for this. The first is Fast Casting. When clicking a Target Location skill, the skill will instantly cast where ever your cursor is on your screen. The second option is Fast Cast with Location Marker. When clicking a skill the location marker is display **while holding** the skill hotkey. Upon release of the key, the skill will activate on your mouses location (where ever you've moved it to). 
---
I play with Fast Cast with Location Marker. If you single click any skill on your skill bar with a location (with snap lock on or off) the default location is Target Self. 
---
Hey the waypoint is in the far NW corner.  It should still have opened the WP even though it kicked you out.  
---
To be fair, rollercoaster ride would be exactly what they're going for at the moment since this season is reaching it's climax.
---
2nd, I'm honestly against faithful recreations of GW1 locations because I think GW2 should spend more time expanding on the world map of the series as a whole. Sandswept Isles is a magnificent example of this. 
---
Otherwise, I agree with your points.
---
That's pretty awesome. Can I stream from your room too? I promise to not break anything!
---
u, v, w.... WUMBO MAGIC!
---
I think you were fine until you said this:
---
&gt; I have like 3x the damage of the next highest person and they're not even a shroom.
---
This can be seen as a little elitist, but more importantly, something like this would be demoralizing to the rest of the DPS. If years of games like TF2 and Overwatch have taught me anything, it's that team morale has a significant impact on performance.
---
So the message you wanted to get across was right, but I think there are better ways to bring up the DPS problem. In this case, it probably would have been sufficient to leave off the last line.
---
I haven't done a lot of raiding in GW2, but in WoW we would typically bring up numbers in terms of group/total DPS. Those that are under performing would typically know, so blanket statements rallying everyone to try harder to push out better numbers would be good enough. This also keeps everyone team oriented, and should help to keep morale up, which I think is important for a training run.
---
OK, I'll go against my "downvote all fashion screenshot posts" policy just this once. This is a really nice look!
---
Can you ship it to New Zealand?  
---
&gt; I've used NVidia 3DTV Play with Virtual Desktop
---
Is there a way to enable SBS 3D in 3DTV Play? I couldn't find a way to do it when I searched for it about a year ago. Has something changed?
---
LW updates really should just be attached to the expansions as a "season pass" thing. After all, dedicated people get the Living world for free anyway (Why would you set the bar for entry even higher for not-as-dedicated people?). That lets them unify maps more and make them more interconnected instead of having to make up some weird reason to go back to an old map just to head somewhere else again. (Kourna maps felt really weird in this regard.) 
---
The volatile/unbound magic ones are the best.
---
hey dont "you guys" me
---
i didn't even own the game during season 2's run.
---
i can tell you that playing through it as a whole with episodes back to back, it had better story pacing than seasons 3 and 4.
---
this would be the simplest solution. i get the feeling most the moneys made off of the rest of the gem store anyway...the money made from living world is probably a drop in the bucket long term.
---
I'm at 24 and a keyfarm slot :D
---
Underwater stuff, perhaps player housing, guild stuff revamp/additions (which means ANet needs to dedicate to that)
---
Your birthday gifts include boosters, dyes and skins. Nothing you need to hold back to use, if anything check the wiki with your API so you see which are the most expensive dyes to choose. 
---
Take expensive dye you like
---
But Joko build the wall, not him.
---
*The plot thickens.*
---
They could get into the map for the finale, not before.
---
too bad [LGBT] is extremely transphobic.
---
Wood and fragments are per day per character, so you can go with all alts and gather daily. However, nothing is as effective and quick as winterberries, hence the fact that they are farmed more 
---
One map a LW episode is already a lack of sustainable content.  Outside of Bitterfrost there is no reason to go back to any of the lw3 episodes....and theres currently no reason to go back to any of the lw 4 maps.  
---
Side note....is anyone else beyond sick of repeating hearts on multiple characters for map currency?
---
How about the others ? pearls , orchids , blood rubies ? are they ALL per character ,if one should want to go to the trouble ?
---
i didn't care for the hearts system to begin with...repeatable hearts make me itch...
---
Unless you’re a healer where you go dagger/warhorn or staff, or a power tempest that goes scepter/warhorn, or a condi weaver that goes sword/focus. “End of story” lol
---
this is why aliens don't visit us.
---
I think the best example of this is the people that keep asking for a new player race.  The sheer volume of work that would be needed for something like that for something that's wholly cosmetic and which would just make new armour sets even slower to come out should be a clear indicator that we're most likely never getting another playable race.
---
I really prefer Kourna and Silverwastes when it comes to currency grinding...if only there was a consistent standard between episodes 
---
I thought that was build templates?
---
A written guide is enough for me, but I bet there are enough people out there who would love to see one of those screencards in during creation :)
---
Pearls are each char per day. I highly recommend them, each node is a guarantied pearl. +events, hearts and the gamble, you can get a ton of them.
---
You can Port to any of the Major Cities as well as to the Lions Arch Aerodrome by going onto a platform right in the middle of the Sanctuary. You'll get a Pop-Up like when you talk with an NPC and can choose to travel to either of the locations.
---
For the "And-more" Part, let's see...
---
You have the Trading Post NPC right next to the (Guild)Bank NPC, an NPC where you can turn into any of the Creatures from the [Endless Fractal Tonic] (https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Endless_Fractal_Tonic) and a Mini-Game exclusive to the Sanctuary (no Achievement involved, if you ever did the Fractal "Shattered Observetory", before/during the second Boss Fight there is a small Mini Game with a Bouncy Ball, that exist there as well.
---
Additionally, if you are anywhere on the Map of Tyria, use the Scroll to teleport to the Mistlock Sanctuary and, while being in the Sanctuary, use the Port scroll again, you'll get back to where you were before you ported, which is really nice.
---
Generally speaking, the Mistlock Sanctuary is the best "Luxus Area" in the Game, since it also gives you a direct entrance to the Fractals of the Mist, which no other of the Luxus Areas do. Since i have the key I haven't visited Lions Arch apart from Halloween and some minor Achievement stuff.
---
Also you get a Special Action key which grants you a fast 1200 Range Movement Skill for very fast... well, movement, though the Area is pretty small and everything important (Crafting Stations, bank, TP, Mystic Forge) is very close to one another.
---
But in the end it is just a Luxurious Area, nothing you definitely need.
---
You missed my point didn't ya? Lemme explain. 
---
1. He is obviously a DPS, not a healer. 
---
2. He is looking for a good build and power sword/dagger is the best option out there. Everything else is just a meme, cuz Arcane traitline lost its viability due to a boon chrono nerf. You can still play it, but in group content you won't be considered as a "good weaver".
---
3. He is a new player, so forget condi, because Viper stats gonna be hard to get. Also condi is a bad choice for fractals. 
---
End of story, Chapter Two. 
---
Yea i think all of them are. I just knew fragments and wood for a fact, so i just listed those 2
---
Not really. The closest you’ll get to that is heal scourge, a spec with insane reviving power that can carry new players/inexperienced groups, but it provides little offensive support and thusly is only ever taken as a secondary healer to druid. If you make your way into very experienced raid groups that are trying to speed clear, you’ll find that they only take one healer and it’s always a Druid because that spec is loaded with offensive support. The “heal role” is borderline nonexistent in this game, pulsing aoe heals are good enough for all content except lowmanning raids.
---
Looks amazing, why are some of the characters classes identified as “?” though?
---
The thing which sets them apart are the [glyphs](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Glyph_(upgrade)) they come with. Glyphs can removed and put in gathering tools, and glyphs don't run out.
---
However, since glyphs only seem to come from these tools or a Black Lion Chest (if you're lucky) outside of the free glyph you may have gotten when glyphs were introduced, you probably would have to buy tools to get the glyphs (if you'd want different glyphs). Although they can be sold and bought at the Trading Post.
---
I made this guide in part because I myself came back after 4+ years last year!
---
Where the shinies. You realize in medieval ages everyone who was anyone was glowing. 
---
This is not representative of the past at all
---
Not that I know of, no.  My guess is you get the plate for you local instance when you turn in the Light of Deldrimor? I have to run it again to verify.
---
My main concern is that I will be playing guardian... but getting ascended gear for 2-3 specs sounds like it will take forever. Exotic to Ascended... is it going to hold me back much while using exotics?
---
If you have all the materials for Gift of Mastery, you can sell a Gift of Mastery for about 500 gold on r/gw2exchange. 
---
Well I was in PR for a month. Did the clockwise island circle. 
---
I did play while there. 
---
Do I count? 
---
I think they meant, great story, mechanics and etc. 
---
Personally I’m hoping for new elite specs for more gameplay and build option. 
---
&gt; how it introduces the return of the white mantle, only for them to be defeated with...almost no screen time.(they're only in 2 episodes...)
---
You mean they were actually introduced much earlier with raids. Not to mention that there is no rule stipulating that any one subject must be drawn out for a year before you're allowed to close it off. If anything the White Mantle this time were for us veterans, a nice node towards a long going mystery. Of which it lead into PoF with a nice payoff, baring episode 6 which was mediocre.
---
&gt; season 2 was also when anet was in a transitional phase to an expansion model. resources were tight and a lot of personal were likely being reshuffled, a very unproductive work environment. today anet seems a lot more financially stable and settled into an expansion model.
---
No they weren't, I mean, they were in a phase of "what the fuck do we do?!" but they certainly weren't working on HoT from the start. For more than half of season 2 there was no talk of an expansion nor a hint of one. The expansion began development late into season 2 which is why we get about a years plus worth of drought and waiting. In fact long before that no one had a clue of it being a thing. It was a surprise to the majority of us, those who weren't already speculating the possibility. 
---
&gt; because i played it as a single whole....the way it was initially written out.
---
Not really. It was initially written out to be in chunks, this whole episodic TV analogy they were going for. Which is why Dry Top AND Silverwastes were unlocked gradually as the season went on. You got access to BOTH maps right from the start!
---
We, on the other hand, got little chunks every so often and not every episode expanded one of the maps. You're view on S2 is skewed at best because of the fact that you weren't there when it launched. That's fact.
---
I'm not saying it was bad but it certainly wasn't any better than S3 or 4. Certainly not even close in quality and quantity.
---
All they got working for them was a map wide meta with a crap ton of purchasable items that still, for the most part, have value today. In part thanks to an easy to craft ascended back item and value on the market for said items. That's the only reason those maps still see a lot of traffic.
---
Season 2 as content was too little and spread too thin, in consequence of a tight schedule evident as the season went on, easily noticeable near the final stretch. While an episode, now, may take an approximate 8 months to complete we get so much more and we only have to wait an approximate 3 months for it. Which is more than fine. Not to mention that we now have instances with badass mechanics that they could have only ever dreamed off during season 2! Even chapter steps are better integrated into the game and open world.
---
Hostile detected.
---
Ah , so they have an account hard cap. That sounds more likely , although I hadn't seen it for myself as I have just now started to think about farming these. I bet most people either don't have enough alts to notice , or just don't try it on them all. Anyway , thanks for the heads up , before I try taking 18 toons to one of the zones besides Bitterfrost , and getting pissed ,lol.
---
Yeah, that is a definite. I came on not even thinking about tips, but I am super grateful for anyone who did tip me but I am not upset at all if you did not. I mostly came on because I have taken a lot of TPs for daily JPs and wanted to give back a bit.
---
Such a nicely done transmog. I hope you're a firebrand healer as well especially now that they're really good healer/supports.
---
Perhaps what they mean is that expansion tier content will be given to us slowly over time rather than in bulk as is the case with an official expansion release. If so, then this is exactly what the game needs to prevent living world from becoming stale.
---
Which means no more actual expansions though.
---
Your guardian is meta class in all 3 modes. Dh/ condi fb in pve, core guard/ medi dh/ support fb in pvp/ wvw. Another option is revenant, support or condi renegade in pve and power herald for pvp/wvw
---
That's cool. Don't think anyone would have an issue with how you're going about it :)
---
in my last post, those same rules would apply to those who DEMANDED a teleport. As I've sadly witnessed these... Not sure which bog they crawled out from, but it was certainly not one from any current civilization. 
---
Holosmith in no way has a cheap excuse. They are using zephyrite crystals, that is why they are mainly seen around The Crystal Oasis. That is where the Zephyrites dwelled. The main lore NPC tells you that.
---
i think this character simply uses the real world definition of the word 'monk', i.e. a man of faith in service to a deity, not the gw1 profession definition. as such, the rest of the monks should be the other devoted individuals all around the world. just to give a simple example, in Divinity's Reach, in the topmost level, in the Shrine of the Six, you can find six different monks of each of the human gods. another example is just a ways up the road from this NPC, at the Eldvin Monastery, where arguably all the NPCs there are monks.
---
Personally, I don't take ports very often, but when I do I'll usually tip a gold or so. When I'm giving ports, though, I never expect it. Typically I'm just there to help people out, and any tips are nice but not really a big deal. The people who expressly expect tips annoy me to no end, and I've occasionally hopped on a Mesmer out of spite to portal the same spot. Just let people tip what (if anything) they think is appropriate, if you're doing ports hoping to make bank you should probably be doing something else anyway.
---
Are they really? Honest question. I love playing healer/support and I love guardians, but they don't seem to really excel in this department.
---
If they actually do, I'd love to know more :)
---
It only gets better and it's a well known fact that they rushed Zhaitan to push for their scheduled release date. Trust us when we tell you that it only gets better from there on in.
---
Each of the Path of Fire elite specializations has a master NPC who tells you about the source of their craft, how it was discovered and more.
---
They also added mastery points throughout central tyria
---
Not necessarily, every time they add a new stat set there’s a possibility the meta changes. For example, Diviner’s may have just made Firebrand+Renegade able to replace non-tank Chronos, and all the other comp shakeups that would entail. That alone would be a big meta change, and made possible with just new gear, not a whole new set of elite specs.
---
Need suggestions for good Ranger build without the expansions. I understand that Druid is usually used as healer and Soulbeast is usually used as DPS. Without the expansion, how may one spec a ranger to fulfill a support/power DPS role?
---
You can easily do most fractals on core guardian too! no need to wait. Also, dragonhunter only needs Heart of Thorns, and you get more raids from HoT.
---
Oh that's cool
---
You know what I meant :(
---
Aren't there better tools than the others like harvesting tools which gather faster than others, or mining tools which strike more each time? from what i was reading there were some recommanded tools a little while back which were better than the others.
---
If they fixed it and made them all equal, I'd appreciate if someone can confirm that.
---
The boosters are useful anytime we get a new Mastery, since they increase the rate at which gain Experience, which is applied to the current active unfinished Mastery track. Once you’ve completed all available Masteries, Useful to use boosters while leveling Masteries.
---
Experience continues filling up an XP bar even after you’ve completed all Mastery tracks, and you get 3 Spirit Shards each time the bar completes. Not worth wasting boosters on that, though.
---
Two questions: Why at guild halls specifically and not just everywhere? And are Unbound better than Volatile, or did you mean both?
---
Been playing around on my human revenant Comrade Balthaczar and having fun doing the story over again but I just realized I can't use human racials?!? Comrade Balthaczar is without his hounds? This game is so well thought out in so many ways but I find this inexcusable from a fantasy perspective. 
---
I know some people would argue that perhaps being a revenant would lock you out from a true connection to the gods but really for immersions sake this is dumb. 
---
I picked rev cause the idea of him being reborn into a rev kinda makes sense. Not to mention the hope that revs get a legendary balthazar stance + Gs on next specialization. 
---
What are the chances they will fix this?
---
GW2 supposedly has a Renaissance/early gunpowder age-based high fantasy setting. Some level of copper, silver or even gold gilding on decorative armor patterns, would actually be historically accurate in cases where a high-ranking military office (such as “Commander” of an army) is involved. I think this look certainly strikes a good balance between aesthetics and immersion. 
---
I do however have some rationality issue with distribution of weight of the armor pieces in most armor sets in fantasy games like GW2. IN historical context the problem with armor is always a balance between weight and protection level: the more you have to carry on your body the less endurance and tactical flexibility you will have. 
---
Assuming all your armor pieces are made of same type of metal you’d want to make every ounce of the weight you put on counts. It’s a no brainer that your head and torso are probably the most vulnerable as the damage to a vital organs is generally much worse than a gash on your bicep. So that’s why I’m always a little puzzled when fantasy games have all these big bulky bracers, pauldrons and greaves but much thinner torso armor. The historical trend tends to show just the opposite: as gunpowder technology improved, armor pieces start to come off as maneuverability becomes more important to combat effectiveness than sheer armor coverage; that’s when historical armies started to let go of shoulder armor first, starting with shoulder and arm pieces, then legs, until all that’s left is just a helmet and a breastplate/cuirass. 
---
Does it come in a frosted format? Like... well frosties. 
---
Well, unless someone geninunely enjoys farming stuff, the same can easily be said for any "rewarding" map meta out there. People flock to whatever provides the most efficient gold farming method. So any meta that's not as "rewarding" or has no specific reward packed into it / or for achievement points is more or less considered as not good. Again, unless someone truly enjoys running events/metas as content. 
---
I'm **not** an MMO's target audience, but the idea of the armor or dragonblood weapon set itself sounds okay to a story-only gamer. The reason why I'm not doing them is that I can't be bothered to farm gold by doing stuff over and over and over and over again, which is - and I'm quite aware of that - the driving idea behind (most?) MMOs.
---
Better than the *vast* majority of fashion posted here. Nice job. I'd personally switch the boots for something a bit less subtle, though.
---
It isn't Captn. Crunch, crunchberry ver. The true destroyer of the roof of your mouth? 
---
Seems like that would be more fitting.
---
i like the dyes, and the individual armour pieces; but i feel like theres a lot of clashing; theres pieces that are intricate (chest and shoulders), pieces that are simple/plain (legs) and im not sure how to describe the boots; theyre neither; gilded but not intricately
---
Is I get HoT then Viper will be available right but Iboga is still not. is there  replacement for it? Condi DPS is cool though is it viable in fractals/dungeons?
---
Guild Calendars please! And reasonable use for commendations/pricing. Also, the multi-whisper cap really fucking sucks especially because it was how we got around the mail system being so bad.
---
I would settle for just an in-game calendar that was guild editable. That way you could see events from multiple guilds, in-game events, etc.
---

As soon as there is a definition, there is reverse engineering. Humans are like computers but dumber in a sense, because humans think "this would be hard to guess". The processor thinks "this is most logical". Logical is not always = hard to guess. But usually people are pretty predictable. Mathematically you may be right.
---
There are only so many words that you come to think of as a person sitting in front of a new game which you have just made an account for and now you have to select a password... it will be done very very fast by the majority of people. 
---
Password is: horsewoodpotatoshoe
---
Nobody would naturally pick that password because it doesn't fit with our predefined associations with the initial words. The function doesn't see anything wrong with it tho. The function thinks nothing of it and runs the test anyways. 
---
Choosing 4 words as a long password is kind of like choosing 4 symbols from all the worlds languages. So in a sense, you tell the processor to only apply that input on the function and now, the processor thinks that &lt;horse&gt; is the same thing as "symbol" and by that definition &lt;horse&gt; is == 1 / x symbols in the phrase. When it has guessed horse to fit somewhere in the phrase, it moves on to the next word which is why only 4 matches are needed to find the entire phrase. 
---
Next you have to find he order of the phrase and potential words that are made up within combining them. Say that Persons password is made by someone who likes potatoes. If they are smart they will input their password like this horsewoodpotaTOEShoeS horse wooden potato shoes, pretty easy to remember. 
---
This makes it exponentially harder for the function to place the &lt;symbol&gt; properly:
---
1.horse 2.wood potato? potatoes? toes? shoe? shoes? 
---
Now imagine this password: WuDdenpot4thoseShO35
---
Assumed to be hard to remember so not likely chosen, but hard to process so less likely to be broken. 
---
Sadly the natural way is the lazy way... man or machine 
---
Like the previous person said, depending on the boss, you may feel more heavy than on other's due to the nature of the boss and/or the situation you fight the boss in. You could definitely play one class for every boss but depending on the class and boss, if you cannot perform well on dps (assuming you're maiming a dps class), then it could pose a problem due to a lot of bosses having an enrage timer that can cause the fight to become exponentially harder.
---
As for the meta, most people tend to gravitate towards it due to the fact that it is tried and proven. There are definitely people out there (such as me) that love to try and welcome new things. It is harder playing off meta when joining a PUG, but not impossible.
---
If you play on NA and would like to join a guild that frequently does training, semi exp, and exp raid runs, shoot me a message any time! Have fun!
---
What I want to ask as a rebuttal to this, is that would it be a bad thing if we get the same type and amount of content in an expansion, just in a LS?
---
So if you are a paladin, does that make me a Death Knight?  
---
[https://imgur.com/a/YBX2ORT](https://imgur.com/a/YBX2ORT)
---
That is one great looking character. Very much to my tastes and pleasing to look at. I'd personally try to find some different dyes for the trousers and a different pair of boots (they look a little out of place) but that's me.
---
How could you be downvoted ? Almost the whole community thinks the same way. But you maybe won't be upvoted too, because it's old as the game.
---
Welcome. You think like everyone else here. :)
---
&gt;Why do the devs continue to release living world stories instead of taking a few weeks and fixing the worst mission in the game?
---
Why would they bother going back to fix it? It will make exactly $0 for the company, unlike adding new content, so there's no reason to change old content.
---
i can confirm isnt working, tried in thunderhead too, also the rifle one 30kill, dosent work
---
Yeah, it is. The complete list for anyone curious is:
---
* Drops directly from Mobs
---
* Loot boxes from PvP and WvW   
---
* Silverwastes Chests    
---
* HoT Loot Boxes     
---
* Unidentified Gear     
---
* Lunar New Year Envelopes
---
Normally I like it on, adds some weight and usually doesnt bother me. It was just excessive in this mission
---
thx. i always think i have it but when i actually need to craft it i remember i dont have it.. time to get it
---
Im not saying redesign it from the ground up, maybe just cut out some of the extra enemies during the dragon fight, not all, just some, and make it so the dragons dont circle you for as long. A lot of the mission is just fluff where nothing is happening and you're waiting.
---
yeah, elementalists did have too much visual noise. Bosses in group fights were giant balls of light because of elementalist skill animations. Anet had agoalfor GW2 to look more at mobs and less at skill bars (compared to GW1), but you can't predict enemy skills when they're distorted with visual noise. You could also hear meteor showers from far away when the game launched, which is so unnecessary for a non-elite skills.
---
I remember the bs being said back in the day. “We want new lore not stuff we already know”.

If you have the gems/gold/money, LW2 gives you the opportunity for core MPs.
---
Not enough skulls and edginess for you to be an ~~emo~~ death knight.
---
We've gone from arguably the best LS release (Jahai Bluffs) to (also arguably) the worst so yeah they need to re-evaluate what they are doing.
---
One more addition for Guild Halls: Allow people to deposit decorations and WvW improvements &amp; tactics without delay. 
---
It would be a huuuuge QoL feature to me. 
---
&gt; Does it take long or changes everything instantly?
---
Adding a couple of details on this one. If you are in a city, a hub (Mistlock santuary, Aerodrome and Fractal Lobby too I think) or a WvW spawn the swap is extremely quick: it will take a second to swap everything.
---
If you are inside a fractal, in a PvE map, inside a raid wing and such there is a "limitation" that was implemented that only does 1 action every 0.5 second (so that it's not that OP compared to someone having to change manually) and in this case the full swap will take 5-10 sec depending on how much gear you need to swap.
---
If you have a Legendary Armor/Weapon it will also allow you to swap stats and Runes/Sigils easily.
---
&gt;Is it fail proof?
---
Every once in a while it messes up on the weapons for me on some character but it's because, for example, I have a Sword in offhand on 1 template on my Chrono and the template I want to load is supposed to put this sword in my main-hand and it does not llike it that much apparently so I need to equip it manually but that's all.
---
&gt;Typical spots to duel just outside of SMC, inbetween the zones.

As far as I have seen on EU servers there is basically no one seeing those as "typical spots to duel"

---
It's only 4 guesses, but if it could be one of 2000 words, that's 2000^4 which is approximately close to 2^44. Which matches what xkcd suggested.
---
Obviously if the human isn't actually picking randomly (which most of them will not) it's not going to produce great results.
---
The best way to generate such a password is to use a good source of randomness to select the words, rather than picking them in your head.
---
The entropy calculation *is* assuming the attacker knows that you used the system, and even assuming they know your word list. I.e. which 2000 words you picked from.
---
That entropy calculation isn't going to be accurate if the person isn't picking words at random.
---
So basically make a map without any hooks to it, but still do Living World. I don't think they have the resources to do that lol.
---
ugh, the elegy pants are so unbalanced. they are pretty much BiS for every light female character atm. We need more pants, the ascalon ones dont even compete
---
New content doesn't always need to be in the form of their current structure.  Its too much of the same and I'm just cooked.  2-3 months of waiting to do a 30 minute story and farm a map for new minis got old well over a year ago for me.
---
LW should have smaller maps that are mostly instanced and very recognizable for new and veteran players.  It should be obvious enough that it doesn't get skipped or looked over.  They should also be purely for lore/story.  Don't add gathering nodes, trash mobs, or rewards other than some completion ones.
---
This all would free up a lot of resources for other parts of the game as well.  Maybe quicker raids and fractals, WvW and PvP content, QoL changes, etc.
---
While anet was developing PoF a lot of the staff moved into the expansion and we had some of the lengthiest content drought of the year with player base losing interested and taking a break from the game.We had updates and balance patches and 1 fractal and a raid wing but it took about a year for all that to come out (the raid wing and fractal took almost 9 months!), meanwhile people were just either repeating same content over and over again.
---
Perhaps anet determined that a continuous stream of content would be more healthy than halting back live game development to work on an expansion. Or they already are creating something slowly with a smaller team so updates dont get delayed. We can only speculate.
---
We also have alliances coming and anet said something about wanting to focus on wvw which will take a crap tone of balancing after alliances go official. Or perhaps they're trying to do something about the sorry state of PvP....
---
From base to head 15 cm (5.9 inch), head to tail 25 cm (9.8 inch). He's not that small :D

No expiry date. The only way to finish the cereal is to eat it, otherwise it gets modly and all but no way to get rid of it. Consumer's discretion is advised.

Exactly this

From start to finish, about 36h ,but spread out over a few weeks
---
Some people don't have a ton of old MF boosters laying around, so getting in as many envelopes in a 1 hour time is crucial, as they might not have a 2nd booster to pop.
---
Thanks for the detailed reply. So if I have Core + HoT, it is not easy to have a "good" Ranger Power DPS right? If that's the case I'll explore the Druid Support lane and see if it fits my play style. Really want to try out Ranger
---
I totally agree with your points! I've been playing since beta and I still stop to enjoy the artwork of gw2. With that said I'm looking for alternatives to Ol good 1-80, but thanks for sharing! :) 
---
&gt;  those WHO DO expect a tip
---
Those are pests. But we can handle them good over here. I get a lot of hate "ruining everyones business". But Pinkies don't care
---
Yeah, that's my plan, I'll get her through all events and WB's
---
This is just not true. The scrapper building will maybe reach 4k dps, Quickness FB at chak gerant will comfortably reach over 15k so you will have to be dead for more than 2/3 of the encounter for it to balance out. The fact is that in most open world metas you have a few people carrying the slack of a whole squad, hence why people get a bit annoyed when this playstyle even gets pushed. It's fine if you want to run around with this in the open world, but don't kid yourself you will be a liability at events where dps matters. 
---
What's that leg armor?
---
Binge-watching Netflix while making those made it a lot less agonizing :D
---
You can try this: https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Ranger_-_Power_DPS
---
It's basically the power soulbeast build for f2p players. Plays almost the same, just has lower damage. Should still be viable for people without expacs.
---
&gt; how do I get her to love the game
---
that is not how love works, i'm afraid. 
---
What she might love is spending time in-game with you, for example, so make that time count and do stuff that is offered and see where it goes from there.
---
These are interesting charts. A bit sad not many people will see them at the mid/bottom of a low-voted thread.
---
I do sometimes see people duel there, IIRC he's referring to the southwestern exit of SM. It's not totally alien to me, on EU.
---
But it's definitely not a real dueling hub like the area near south camp in Alpine BL. 
---
I'm not even 7 months in and boosting left n right with tomes.

play hide and seek with her, play house and make Shure "you"do the dishes, find a recipe for something you might actually make at home, and go on a scavenger hunt for the ingredients.

tell her theres a very romantic castle under atack and make her wait out the event at the top, then come up and save her. litteraly lay down in a river and say nice bridge rp huh.
---
I think the story on the expansion level and with new mechanics, also the maps on the highest level - Season 4 was an introducement, Season 5's episodes will be on All or Nothing level and will most likely feature specializations (I think 6 specs will be introduced with the Season, 3 will be introduced with an expansion.) Plus we can expect mounts, raids, fractals, wvw update - but it's not going to be released in 2019 and WvW alliances will be a core feature of Exp 3. Plus new pvp maps, tournaments.
---
You can do decent [power DPS](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Ranger_-_Power_DPS) as core but it is no where near what it would be with PoF's [soulbeast for fractals](https://discretize.eu/builds/ranger/power-soulbeast). You can go [boon druid](https://discretize.eu/builds/ranger/boon-druid) or even the [older power druid](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Druid_-_Boon_Support_Power_DPS_\(Fractal\)) but they kind of will want some boon duration gear (harrier or diviner usually) to have decent DPS while keeping boons up. Both of those stats are PoF only though so you'd have to go for more off meta stuff like full heal (magi/cleric), full dps (berserker), or tanky (with minstrel). Honestly I would suggest looking into getting the expansion as you make your way into T3 and T4 fractals. It should be noted that if you do get ascended gear now as you're progressing you can always[ stat swap](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stat_changing) armor and weapons later.
---
PoF isn't on a major (50%) sale right now but you can still find it [33% off](https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-path-of-fire-43807) if you're interested in getting it.
---
If some dude is sitting around at a JP for several hours then he is there for tips in my opinion. I have actually seen them say donations welcome.
---
There are obviously a few, like you, that are just there for daily and then and help people along their way. :)
---
I'm just offering you my opinion around who and why I tip and how much, like your post asked :)
---
i think you cocked up your formatting there bud
---
Don't they all share the 24h respawn? Don't think any node resets at "dialysis reset"
---
&gt; The sort of attitude you preach isn't healthy for the mode as a whole.
---
&gt; It's pretty sad that you don't realize how elitist you've become.   You're probably one of the most inhospitable and unfriendly raiders that  I've met on GW2.  When people meme about toxic elitism &amp; GW2  raiding they're talking about people like you that want inexperienced  players to jump through half a dozen hoops before they're even allowed  to cross the starting line. 
---
Thanks for the laugh. At one point you gotta deceide though. If I'm elitist for expecting a 25g and 30 minute investment before going into 10 man endgame content, the community you're talking about is wanting to get everything spoonfed. I'm unfriendy because I say if I'm doing a training run I expect people to at least do their part to succeed? 
---
&gt; I'd much rather disband a training run than kick players.  I'd just end  the session saying something like, "We made some good progress today and  our mechanics have gotten much cleaner.  If you practice your DPS a bit  you've got this!" If it's completely unsalvageable just wish them luck  and leave.  It's not complicated. 
---
Congratz. You just denied more than half the group the kill because the other half is fucking useless. But hey, at least no special snowflake got hurt. That's the most important part. Not rewarding people who actually put effort into this training run.
---
&gt;  It's like you've completely forgotten what it's like to have bad or  inexperienced friends.  There's such a thing as patience, good-will and  benevolence -- as if you've never been helped out. 
---
I got alot of inexperienced friends which I showed raiding to. Just none of them was degenerate enough to go there as a full deadweight while having the option to come prepared. Probably because my friends don't want to leech and drag 9 other people down, but I get it. Rare mindset in the gw2 community.
---
&gt; If you can't even get your gear right and press 1 during a raidboss, why  do you deserve your spot and extra attention? Why are 6 players who want  to actually kill the boss supposed to be hostages of 4 players being  useless af? 
---
I'm still waiting on an answer btw.
---
Are you on a low budget - start doing dungeons that give zerker gear (if no, buy exo from tp, everything else is the same), in couple of days you will be able to switch to fractals, start from T1 and work on your crafting levels, from there go ascended.
---
Did you make this OP?
---
You can't.  The best thing you can do is take a step back and let her decide for herself free of your expectations.  You might not realize it, but in your opening post, you put forth the idea you want her to like and dislike what YOU like and dislike about the game.  You are putting your expectations on her, and trust me, that's not helping.  She's either likes the game, or she doesn't.  If she decides she doesn't, then your only acceptable response is "ok, that's fine, thanks for giving it a try".
---
Activision-blizzard are doing good job helping the cause by killing wow
---
Im not confusing anything. I remember after w4 which was a joke, all the raiding community was waiting and waiting and waiting and after 9 months we got one fractal and w5. That was basically when qt stopped playing as well as a lot of other guilds lost interest simply cause the w8ing time was too much and fractals became stale as well. All we got was LW episodes which basically kept the people playing for a few days then log off to other stuff until another episode comes after 3+ months. 
---
just because it's content you don't personally like doesn't mean it's not content.
---
what's so hard about that notion that ppl don't understand
---
Thank you ! I personaly love the rendering of the chest texture and the folds of the white shirt :)
---
Mounts like all mastery unlocks are account wide so once you get them on any character they are unlocked on all characters. When you boost to 80 most professions get solider gear which is a tanky power set with little damage. You're going to want to get berserker gear for power DPS. [Nika's set](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Nika%27s_armor) is the cheap exotic medium armor that I'd suggest you switch to. You can also check out [this guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character) on options for gearing (designed more with raids in mind but works for fractals too). 
---
Depending on what you want to focus on and what story you have I'd suggest you do either HoT or PoF maps to get hero points and unlock your soulbeast elite spec. Some HoT HPs will need a group as I'm sure you know but all the PoF ones can be done solo, they are much easier in general.  If you have the story to do I'd suggest that as well as it's pretty enjoyable and does have some rewards in it. 
---
Once you have your gear and spec you'll be looking for guides and builds. DT has details on [soulbeast](https://discretize.eu/builds/ranger/power-soulbeast) specific to fractals and Snowcrows has the [build](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/ranger/soulbeast/power/) and [guides](https://snowcrows.com/raids/guides/ranger/soulbeast/power/) for raids. You can also use this [open world ranger build](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Ranger_-_Longbow_Beastmastery) as an idea of what you'll want to do until you have soulbeast unlocked and even when you do there are [builds more designed for open world](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Soulbeast_-_Boon_Berserker) instead of organised content that will be better for soloing.
---
Don't worry, I won't force her, I'm just looking for new ways to experience the game. That's all :) 
---
Your character looks surprisingly much like Richard from Galavant...
---
Some form of GvG. Doesn't have to be the same game mode as in GW1, but something. Could be regular 5v5 conquest, but there's a guild ladder, unique rewards in the spirit of cape trims in GW1, etc.
---
It boggles my mind that the game has rel with none of this, much less that it wasn't added at any point, especially when the eSports scene officially died. There isn't any sense of guild pride or guild membership being prestigious as there was in GW1, they are a non factor in any form of organized PvP.
---
It was a huge thing in GW1 PvP. Even many PvE guilds were participating because it was a fun guild activity.
---
Beyond that, without GvG and with guild missions\activities being abandoned content, guilds are like a glorified contact list. It's not a coincidence that in 6 years of GW2 I've never found a small, tightly knit guild of the type you saw everywhere in GW1, and most guilds behave like what I described - a mega guild \ contact list. 
---
Bumping the request to also share the dye scheme! Nice work!!

I think arcdps has this 'mod' under extras (read the Readme.txt)

Awesome! I have the almost exact same story as yours last year! I bought it not long after launch, and have sporadically played it. The tail end of 2017 and early 2018 (aka PoF launch) i started playing it a lot again! I played a Sylvari Engineer, and my very first ascended is also The Cutting Edge! And i also play from SEA (Indonesia).
---
Ive kinda stopped playing since the release of this season’s LW Episode 2 coz of consistently shittier internet, but i think im going to continue playing again soon. Soulbeast is my planned next class, but i also plan to do Guardian after that too! 
---
Best of luck in your quest for more ascended toys!

CROSS-COUNTER!
---
You certainly arent the most bright person around, are you?Where in my post did i say i dont like it? It just has no replayability, u do the story (however good that is) and thats it.
---
Firebrand is pretty much *the* meta WvW/PvP support, so yes, it excels at healing/support.
---
Lately it has also seen somewhat increased play as a Quickness-provider in PvE, not necessarily as a healer though. 
---
In defense of the mission it used to be a 5 man dungeon, and couldn't be soloed due to mechanics.
---
They looked at how many people hadn't completed it because of that and retooled it to be a solo experience instead of the story mode of the final dungeon. When they did that they changed it the minimum amount necessary to make it a soloable experience instead of something that required a bit more coordination between people on cannons taking the shot when they could and people keeping the adds off of them, and cleansing condis off of the cannon people so they could get in their burns when they could.
---
The result was that the multi person requiring mechanics were removed and the fights were made easier by having adds stripped out. Many long time players may have not done it after their first time because it now cant be replayed on a same character and they have no need to go back.

Didn't knew this was a thing, but now... I have to admit, it's a perfect clone x)
---
iirc that's more like a 22h respawn (for winterberries too), I'd still say that the winterberries is the easiest farm
---
I'm kinda hoping it's a ranger and you have a pet wyvern named Tad Cooper...
---
I agree, the more characters you have the better. But even if just one, I think u get more per day compared to the others. You know....no RNG on node kinda helps (looking at you bloodstone ruby)
---
Any Charr armor, dear god I can't find a light armor that looks decent and doesn't have tail clipping. Heavy at least has Mistward and Dreadnought and the Medium Arah Legs is decent well, but for light the only ones I know of are t1/2 cultural and carapace which are ugly as sin.
---
Not all gathering tools are created equally.
---
Fused Molten Sickle and Consortium harvesting sickle harvest about twice as fast as most other harvesting tools.
---
Glitter bomb Harvesting tool has funky 'root you in place' mechanics that sort of stick, and is the slowest of all harvesting tools.  However it will hit up to 3 times (which only matters in guild halls and if you stack the Bounty glyph with gathering boosts.)  However overall its still bad, so this is one to definitely avoid unless you just love exploding scritt that much.  
---
Unbound or Volatile  (maybe both, but accounts vary and I don't own them to check), will gather for an extra strike (4 strikes for logging/mining, 2 for harvesting) but all have average gathering times.  This means they are better for harvesting non-rich nodes with a Bounty gylph or gathering booster, but not with both bounty AND a booster (as that would likely give more gathers then they can do in one animation).  Rich nodes are not affected by bounty effects, so its no bonus on them.
---
Some other tools give an extra gather per series of strikes or perhaps an extra strike underwater.  However I haven't been able to find any good documentation on them.  And of course Tools that come with any kind of gylph will save you a pile of gold on the TP or give you things not available elsewhere (unbound/volatile magic)
---
Guess I'll give it a try once I'm done with world completion and if they patched it at least I'll be able to sell it on tp.
---
Thanks anyway.

I love their attire, it's not some typical flashy stuff that's probably not realistic for adventurers.

[https://imgur.com/9zKGh0V](https://imgur.com/9zKGh0V) This should help. :\^&gt;
---
Found the racist piece of shit
---
On the picture you somehow swapped the maps.... It should be EotM and Obsidian Sanctum, which has both actually arenas for duels/small gvg. 
---
...but people still have to occupy spots for others on normal maps, I guess....
---
I'm being downvoted and you're disagreeing, but think about it. The next season to finish will be in 20 months.
---
2 months until the final episode in this season
---
3 months wait per episode for the next season
---
And then the wait for the next expansion begins.
---
We're looking at a possible 2 years wait time for the next expansion. People think that's not too long to wait for a new elite spec? :O
---
Then no defensive gear can help you anyway.
---
What’s that pistol ? 
---
Something like Viper but dropping precision for concentration.
---
Most classes have more then enough ways to gain crit via sigil/traits &amp; runes anyway.
---
I agree. Generally my rule of thumb is
---
(a) if the DPS is at or just below the benchmark, reinforce for them how good their DPS is
---
(b) if it's a bit below the benchmark, let it lie
---
(c) if it's significantly below the benchmark, start analysing why
---
(d) if it's consistently below the supports, advise them to visit the golem.
---
No problem always happy to help new players finding their spot in the game :)
---
Use consumable items. I pug every day on power soulbeast and am always top dps with high numbers. Your opening rotation can be wonky with metal rod and/or planks, but your burst spikes really high. Obviously youre not going to reach 90k+, but 70k is pretty easy
---
Heroic key claimed.
---
Dude yur so wrong.
---
Only RIBA and Istan may actually be full of zombies farming.
---
I assure yu, all meta events in have many interactive players who are doing the Meta for either fun, company or just to kill time.
---
I myself met my current guild doing Auric Basin meta and they were just such friendly people I asked them for a guild invite and been having fun till now. 
---
The most popular meta events, world bosses, and even open world exploration areas have fun people hanging around. 
---
I want a diviner for condi (Power/Precision)/Condamage/Condur/Concentration.
---
Then Power/Precision/Ferocity/Healing Power, but that doesnt seems useful unless they rework the whole Healing Power scaling.
---
All level 80 maps should be available to all players at all levels and every map past HoT should have 10pt HCs and QoL related compltetion rewards. Sure, lvl 10 Hero Of Shaemoore will die immediately in Lake Doric but think of the glory if they can ninja a "commune" challenge.
---
&gt; in medieval ages everyone who was anyone was glowing
---
Could you please elaborate on how you thinks this glowing you speak of was implemented in medieval times?
---
I am a noob :P
---
You have a way better understanding of color schemes than most of the people you can meet in the game.
---
I'm hoping for Cond/Exp/prec/conc or Cond/Conc/prec/exp, it would make condi druid great again.
---
cant use any of them, so everything claimed i guess? :P
---

I love a lot of the artwork that gets posted in here. So much of it belongs as a loading screen.
---
Great job!
---
Its cairn training. Probably got ported 24/7 and hit my the shards
---
Never post keys publicly. Keys are a way to claim ownership.
---
Nah this isn't the end. Not even close. This is the I just installed gw2 last week fashion. Keep trying new stuff and experimenting.
---
Imo make a new character. Resting a while from your main will make your main fun again. Also having the option to pick something else to play on a day were you are bored with your main give you more freedom. Sometimes it can also get you in to other game modes because it opens up new ways of playing that you did not know you enjoyed until you tried playing something else.
---
They all have roughly a 22 hour refresh per character. You can harvest each node once per character per 22 hours until you hit the account wide caps.
---
Build Template. Dungeon Revival. New Mounts. the real Housing feature. Instagram/Twitter feature. are the only thing that came to my mind. hopefully not intagram/twitter tho
---
One key could net you 3,000g though heh. Luck of the draaaw
---
I feel the Drytop and Silverwastes model is the best we've had so far. Introduce the map with one episode, then unlock the rest of it and continue the story there in the next episode.
---
It means more events per map, a more concentrated gathering of players in the same place for longer, a chance to delve deeper into the location/story etc by not zipping away to a new theme so quickly, but still satisfying the need for new zones.
---
Major - Power/Condition Damage
---
Minor - Ferocity/Expertise

I play Guardian obviously.  :)   Please no more toughness on every piece of gear!
---
Has got to be a Mesmer.
---
Ah sweet, looks like it was updated just today with Diviner!
---
Your maths sounds a bit weird to meas you seem to consider Raid and Fractal scenarios as completely equivalent when they clearly are not because you don't have another chrono using SoI in Fractals which can make a pretty big difference in the amount of boon duration needed. For instance I don't really think 25% in fractals is a realistic number at all except maybe if you run with super good DPS players that can kill/phase bosses extremely fast.
---
But yeah as I said, you'd need only a bit more boon duration to be safe, nothing too fancy.
---
&gt;you'll never quite hit the damage of an actual DPS
---
I wish I could say this never happened but sadly... :p
---
I fckng hate cliffhangers
---
You really can't go wrong with berserkers stats on most power builds. In addition, you can change the stats on ascended gear with the mystic forge later, its not exactly cheap but its way less than forging new gear so  you aren't going to be "stuck" with any stats you might want to change later.
---
As far as the 80 boost, you can use it and try out the class running around silverwastes before you have to commit to it. Imo id use it on a necromancer; they're by far the most boring to level compared to how their elite specs play.
---
So are you.
---
Neither do you. You're making the claim that other players are doing significant damage and you have nothing to back it up.
---
Is it though? It was two years from HOT to POF, and it's only been one year since POF. Moreover, a few elite specs still need a further rework like Tempest, Renegade, Scrapper (yes, again), and Berserker which could easily take a year based on the rate Anet releases balance patches.
---
Condition, Toughness Major, Expertise, Concentration Minor.
---
Basically Vigilant, but Condi instead of Power.
---
I would love to use such a combination on a Renegade or Firebrand.
---
Hell I might even try running it on Condi Thieves or Condi Druids. 
---
Try farming for Ascended gear, most preferrably from Raids or Fractals.
---
Keep practicing everyday and get better at the class.
---
Maybe decide to pick up Soulbeast to see if yu enjoy the extra mechanics. 
---
I watched a video and this seems risky. Looks pretty much like a wall hack.
---
This issue is almost entirely because of technology. Part of it is readability of silhouettes as well. And a bit of tradition that is difficult to shake as a visual inspiration. I'll try to be brief.
---
Shoulders, arms and weapons are the most visible portion of a character at first glance. To make them look different from oneanother, they need a strikingly different silhouette. If they are form-fitting and weight-efficient designs they will all look the same from a little bit of distance. That's why these are all impractically large in most third person games. 
---
In addition, because of how 3D works, especially in regards to a fixed character model being able to wear many different designs, the equipment needs to overlap the body and underlying layers of equipment. Otherwise you will have clipping issues. Since the equipment itself is deforming very little or not at all, while the limbs are deforming a lot, they simply have to take up more space. This especially applies to pieces that cover joints. 
---
And then finally, the expectation to see these elements in fantasy games because of predecessors (who were even more limited in technology.) It's difficult to shake that games like World of Warcraft has set a standard for what a fantasy MMO is supposed to look like. Therefore designing a game that is vastly different can be a huge risk. Personally, I believe GW2 does a good job threading between, having a number of reasonable designs as well as catering to the bulky fantasy trope. Besides, you can even toggle shoulder, glove and helmet visiblity to further empower the player to look as reasonable as they want to be.
---
Add repeatable content more than once every 294 days
---
Don't worry, I completely agree with you. 
---
Where are the TS server advertising commanders? 
---
Sounds good, just debating guild wars 2 or giving eso another shot 
---
I was in the same situation. Happy with gw2 at the moment! 
---
This game is the only PvE game for me. That's because the PvE in the game isn't focused on instances. Sure there raids and fractals and dungeons, but the main focus of the game seems to be open world stuff, and there's plenty of it. 
---
My end game isn't raids. It's collections and crafting. Making legendary weapons is one of the things I like to do. Unlike other games, those weapons don't have higher stats...they simply have cooler skins...and they give you special footprints when you run. They often have special sounds, animations and particle effects attached to them.
---
So you don't have to grind to get a legendary because it's not going to lock you out of content if you don't have it. That's one of the big differences between this game and others. Not very much locks you out of content.
---
Grinds here tend to be optional, so you get to pick what you want to work on.
---
What you won't find here is a breadcrumb trail leading you around. That makes it a really good game for a guy like me, who likes to do his own thing and play without guidance. It's a freeing feeling compared to other MMOs I've played.
---
Not sure how you'll deal with it, some people love it, some don't, but that's one of the things I like about Guild Wars 2.  
---
Pretty. Personally would've replaced the boots with something smaller in cloth or leather, probably with a less bright dye because currently they are standing out.
---
I pasted this wall of text to someone the other day that asked about GW2. It is information about GW2 and the endgame. You have a lot videos linked to check out what there is to do.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ahepn8/been_wanting_to_return_a_few_questions/eefjqxt/
---
In EU at least before HoT came out there was a nice community that stayed in OS to duel/spectate. But that scene died out. When the  EotM arena came out there were also a couple people i saw there sometimes, but that too died quickly.
---
It takes player initiative to restart something like that, and i'm not sure if there are enough players with an interest anymore. Most people i assume would rather 1v1/duel occasionally while roaming in EB/BL's. That's why areas like around the south-most sentry have duelers sometimes.
---
Yeah my "unrealistic" comment was more in the focus of running with pugs/average players which would be the case of OP since they are asking a question here.
---
On a side note I forgot how much Assassin the optimizer puts on chrono as soon as you run Duelling it's crazy.
---
I've managed to get myself into the habit of only checking the world map when travelling - so if I need to study it I'll stop, find a safe place, open the map and have a look. At least that way it's much more immersive.
---
Cant anet just let us pick which stats to make our own combo?
---
That's awesome! You can hear that it needs some work (lows are sometimes a bit too overwhelming) but overall it's an interesting take on the track ;) Keep it up!
---
11/10 bookah would attend
---
Looks fantastic! Bonus points for being my server too. I don’t remember anything like this in the old Piken Square. I’ll need to go back and refresh my memory. Any excuse to boot up GW1. 😂
---
Plus Bitterfrost is one of my favorite farming map :
---
* Enter map
---
* Get the chests
---
* Get the 4 coral nodes
---
* Get the winterberries
---
* Get the chests once more because the meta happened :)
---
Thanks, I believe i got the sigils right but I should look into it once ingame.   
---
At least, I had them right on GS/LB but probably forgot on my sword/axe rotations - thanks for the reminder!  
---
I sorta thought there was more to it, buying it so cheap at TP almost feels like a cheat, dunno.   
---
Isn't warhorn more condition related (i have no idea)? Or is it purely for mobility reasons?   
---
To be honest, I didn't look much into the other weapon options for a ranger. Only got to SW/Axe Axe/Axe rotation since the other day.   
---
Before that it was purely GS/LB
---
(or, although less likely given the theme, a holo)
---
You mean just like all the speculations threads about the latest episode ending, which were getting upvoted again and again despite saying the same thing over and over? (without the 7 years ofc) 
---
Yeah, I could see that indeed.
---
Thanks, haven't completed my normal story yet. Would you recommend starting PoF already?   
---
I did it just to get the raptor mount, but didn't venture any further yet.   
---
Well noted on the dodge, didn't realize this yet, will look into it further!
---
the 7 years is a very important distinction
---
Switch to daredevil and jump around like a dumbass.
---
Staff has some nice cleave
---
Alright, thanks a lot for all the replies and discussion, I have a better understanding of it all now :)
---
Yeah, Fractals are on the schedule with the guild on an almost weekly basis. Only don't T1's for now.  
---
Well, to be fair, only done fractals once BUT should be more regular from now on.   
---
I feel like i'm missing a gapcloser with sword/axe, though could be me. 
---
Warhorn brings vulnerability and boons.
---
&gt;Instagram/Twitter
---
What
---
Either switch to daredevil staff or play some other char a bit
---
I see where you come from with scrapper and tempest but whats wrong with the other two? Renegade and berserker have insane condi damage potential with some support options. 
---
....now that i think about it i am actually curious what you dont like about the other two as well \^\^
---
Oh yeah, very good work.
---
All you dueling snowflakes GTFO. Gonna keep sniping you all day long.
---
Im talking about burst for those numbers. Of course youre wasting attack of opportunity but the dmg waste isnt even close to what you waste when using whirling defense without the stun modifier
---
That's a spoiler
---
i mean if living world downsized to a season 2 style format again, they could redistribute resources into bigger more frequent expansions. living world just there to bridge the gaps. i dont think they should ditch living world...just not tie everything to it.
---
https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/39.121/ shows a set of frech "ceremonial armor" which is a concept in many periods throughout history (although in 15 minutes I only found European examples as easy links. If you scroll down to the description, you can see that the armor was designed to be worn in parades. Here's another cool example: https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/23094 I'll edit this if I find examples from other cultures.
---
&gt;Whats with all the talk about reviving with Joko's magic though?
---
because the foreshadowing of this event is so blatant i can't think of anything funny to compare it to
---
That looks awesome
---
"You just defeated Balthazar! Do you want to share the news?"
---
King Condi: condition/precision/expertise.
---
Those are some pretty great screenshots!
---
I recommend just jumping into daily T1s on the lfg because those are pretty easy even without knowledge of the levels. Greatsword 3 and rock gazelle beastmode f2 are great gap closers. Axe 5 melts fractal enemies.
---
Playing different weapon combos as Deadeye is the most enjoyment I get from thief when trying to play around the malice mechanic.
---
Initiative by itself is pretty boring. Adding a combo point system adds to the fun to me.
---
Legendary Demon Stance represent!
---
Maps should be continued, it's a wonderful system.  The maps can be improved though.  Give things for individuals to do by themselves like season 3 maps which I still visit very often.  
---
And for the majority crowd, just give something equal to Istan for your group zerg thing.  That will keep your maps busy for all kinds of players.
---
As for the story, they can remove all maps and all game features and just fully focus on story and it still won't take more than one day to finish.  
---
If anything should be reduced or eliminated, it should be the story as that takes a lot of time that can be used on the maps.  But, again, there are players who enjoy the story even though it's but a couple of hours even few months.
---
Hey guys. Bought HoT very long time ago coz of sale, never played it tho. I was playing a lot of vanilla tho. To keep it brief here are my questions.
---
Elite specialisations: are they mandatory? For example I was a condi necro. but new spec requires me to use a greatsword and afaik greatswords are for berserkers, so I would need to use a completly different gear? If I like a different set of weapons am I kind of screwed?
---
Living world: I see I can redo some parts of the Living World, when should I buy it? After doing all the zones of HoT? Same question for Living world of path of fire. Also it says something that I can do it for free if someone else has it hmm...
---
I plan to play as a pistol thief, what stats should i prio?
---
Thx guys, cheers.
---
1) that depends on how much play time you've got (also 9 months of content for each release is a bit much) 
---
2) it's pretty obvious that 99% of all "not enough content" posts are of ppl that only play a small portion of the release  because they're not interested in anything else and it the post i reacted didn't belong to the 1%
---
it might be the negative way of looking like things but the past has not really been reassuring, regarding the capabilities of Anet as a company.
---
So I'd say it's a safe bet that it simply means there won't be any expansion anymore and the rest is just up in the air. If and when Anet will release stuff that THEY deem expansion-level features is therefore totally up in the air and might as well never be done.
---
I just hope they announce something like GW3 this year, since I think it's safe to say that the Living Story format ultimately failed. Just look at it. Story you play through in one evening and a gorgeous map that only offers more of the same old stuff. It's easily twice as large as it should be and the development time that went into it is essentially wasted in the long term or even beyond the time it takes for the next patch to be released.
---
There's a streamer called "EnviouslyTV" who uses an ultra-wide monitor. He loves it, but it also means that if you were to say stream it (not to say you would), it would cut off the sides of the monitor and this removes the party UI / map UI from view.
---
He's a long term wide-screen user so if you have any questions I'm sure he would be happy to answer them. He's very approachable. (The name above is his twitch user). 
---
Good luck :) 
---
Nice skirt
---
Can confirm OP, at least south spot of SMC is frequently used as dueling area even on EU, especially when many people roaming around and the zergs are just a few ones. This happens at the "late shift" mostly on my experiences and **depends heavily** on the alliances- and enemy composition (server wise).
---
++ Condition power, healing power + expertise vitality for condiheal scourge.

Legendary stats please thank you when?

I thought this was a Dark Soul screenshot for a moment until I saw the name of the Reddit. Lol, it reminds me a lot to it.

Alright then, keep your secrets

You can not see your custom eye colour. Pink or violette eyes for max fashion score. Also I miss at least one viper skirt.

---
*At last, now I shall feast on their anguish!* 
---
It's an organic thing, mostly during roaming hours. Many roamers are seeing each other on these spots because these are crossroads. Such duel events resulting very spontaneously on the situation [FeintFate](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ai7lo7/dueling_areas_in_wvw/eelsls9) describes, motivated especially by this one:
---
&gt;The person they fight appears to be a good player, so they dont stomp / you dont stomp them when they are downed.
---
It's a matter of mutual respect.
---
Depends on the gold you have, and the speed of getting gold while you play. It's around 100 gold for the 4 basic mounts, and 250 gold for the griffon. And you need to make some events for it, so the exact time is also important for the events to be able to complete them.
---
Yep made about 100g last night running metas its great .. I did get lucky with some more costly exotics . you can even get precursors this way. Have a buddy this is all he does becides wvw and he has gotten 2 in the past week.
---
I would stick to the thief. Someone correct me but DPS between Marauders and berserkers should not be night and day. If you gear the character you enjoy playing and do stuff like T4s (and raids) with it, you will drown in ascended armor and weapons in the long run anyways, which makes actually playing alt characters just so much easier. If you start to equip a different character now, you will just be stuck with two semi-equipped professions for way too long.
---
That said, ascended gear is not soulbound and you can switch it from one character to another. If your thief becomes boring, you can strip it down and put all the shinies onto an engineer or a ranger, the accessories even on literally anything.
---
Took me 2/3 weeks for all.
---
depends, the 4 base mounts will take you almost the duration of the pof story + some gold grinding (if you've got low funds)
---
griffon will take you slightly longer, (as you need to finish the pof story before you can start the griffon quest) the quest itsef is about an hour or 2(iirc) if you've got the gold, a guide and decent gamer skillz.
---
tho if you plan to get them for core or HoT content i recommend just getting for the raptor (or none at all)
---
Maybe they got that way after the launch of the game itself, where they teased gw2 *years* before it was ready?
---
That's huge red flag. 
---
How so?
---
1. fair enough
---
2. fair enough \^\^
---
Usually when it comes to daily JP, I don't want to tip, because the only reason I'm doing it is for the 2g, and if I'm giving 1g for a tip then.. yeah. But with that being the case, I usually just end up doing the puzzles myself, so I don't have to feel bad for not tipping. It's also kind of fun seeing which JP's can be cheesed now by flying across the map on griffon. Even easier now with Bond of Faith.
---
3. fair enough
---
the story is what i want the most though, they remove that, i stop playing.
---
i dont really care about farming. story and exploration are my thing.
---
I saw your comment on YouTube, and now you actually did it! You're amazing!
---
I dont like it. Looks too flashy for a musketeer
---
nope i have tried :( I have played on the lowest of graphics as well (subsample included), but still got the same thing sadly, thanks for your input though!
---
I could try that, I must admit I didn't try swapping stories and then going back in, thinking I would lose the checkpoint. Thanks! I'm mostly worried about it being something wrong with my graphics card maybe its too old...? No idea :/
---
Saviour: Power/Precision/Healing Power/Ferocity.
---
Nope, eyes glued on the screen! Didn't tab out any of the times. I can't really try and play it on a different PC either thinking it could be a problem with my graphics card... not sure- thanks though! 
---
The gryphon is going to take longer than other mounts, due to the fact that you have to do multiple collections for it, and it costs over double of the other mounts combined (250). Additionally, some of those items are sometimes behind bounties, so depending if you can find a group, it may take a bit of time.
---
Sidenote: The jackal also requires lvl 3 mastery over either the bunny or the skimmer
---
Not a healer in most MMO's but I tend to go through each attunement when needed (water for some spot healing if I notice people need it) but ya primarily looking to DPS. 
---
Play a rifle deadeye cause ANet wants you to play that...cause deadeye changes the way thief plays for over 6 years oh so much - nothing boring about a class playing the same way for over 6 years across all 3 specs. /s
---
just to be clear: it remembers what instance you where at but it resets the checkpoints inside of the instance.
---
i don't know what causes this issue but this solution worked for me, might work for you too, might not, we won't know till you try
---
If what you're looking for is indeed  "*proper* guild teams, with communication, etc. " then TC is not for you. In fact, most servers and guilds are "blindly running around with dumb zergs" 
---
You'll probably want to join CF or KnT, on whichever server they're on, because those guilds actually *want* to be good.
---
&gt;In short, the story suffers because the maps, and the maps suffer because the story.
---
Completely agreeing here. I wanted to do in Vabbi f.e. the Serpents' Ire event completely for [Redeeming IG-6417](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Redeeming_IG-6417) achievement.   
---
I waited more than half a year to finish this in the (late) hours I'm in GW2, because
---
1.: I did it too late (most people already went because of Story progression etc.)
---
2.: the level of coordination let the few runs I got failing. I even tried to get into planned runs of some communities, but the new LS parts changed the plans.
---
At the end, I finished it yesterday because of a ridiculous amount of luck: found a squat in LFG **and** it was a run with experienced players and a frequently and very clear communicating commander.  
---
I paid him for that level of coordination and gave them an expression of gratitude. 
---
I'm playing on a 3840 x 1080 curved display. The only place that gets goofy is the character selection screen where your character gets cropped. 
---
I like to pay gw2 with high fov and for my taste the corner areas move too quickly when I need to turn around alot (e.g. in wvw). So most of the time I play in windowed more with a browser on the second screen half. Flying a griffon in fullscreen is great though, it gives even more impression of high speed.
---
Another small problem - you may need to resize some windows when switiching from fullscreen to windowed - e.g. the minimap. 
---
Apart from that I noticed no problems.
---
The problem is I don’t have 500 gold atm. 
---
Rare footage of a man [farming for a griffon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UANfikf7kZM).
---
I want something to do with all the extra hero points. I could unlock almost two elite specialisation with how much extra I have
---
I wish they would introduce new elite specialisation soon.
---
Damn the atmosphere was so much better in GW1.
---
I still miss it.
---
Kralkatorrik head fight should be a meta event like Mordremoth Mouth :(
---
The best thing I got from BLC were exalted gloves and war god hammer through weapons unlock so  yeah with my luck I doubt I’ll get anything I could trade for gold 
---
Like I said I got lucky with exotics but most of the gold was from the volatile magic . just look up istan farming on YouTube and search for a group running it in the LFG they multi map ... The right way so its non stop farming and I only did it for 2 hr not all night . just get a good build that will tag mobs Fb or engi best so far I use burn firebrand. Got about 4k vol magic in that time and bought trophy ... Also if ur making legs save the mats u need for that leg then u don't have to buy it not making gold but your not having to spend it
---
3 years is too long, I'm in favor of 2 years. 
---
The thing is, if they don't fix current elite specs, then t will take them ages when the next round comes with continuous nerfs. 
---
The NA wvw discord has a guild recruitment channel that sometimes gets updated: https://discord.gg/BYwARVa
---
It's not toxic anymore btw, more like everyone is always facetious.
---
GW1 never looked like this tho
---
NEEEERD!
---
In all honesty, was very interesting to read, kudos, but this opportunity was just too good to let slip by
---
Glacial Blow and Devouring Darkness are missing :(
---
I'm pretty sure this post is as a help for those people that interrupt obvious duels happening in those areas.
---
If theres some loner running around that spot i'll jump him and have a quick duel myself. Big shade at every player that stays in towers or keeps and just cannons players, can't imagine why that would bring joy to anyone ever.
---
You can still get one-shot with a ton of toughness in wvw, it's just how the math works out.
---
*Glasses intensifies*
---
Oh sorry thought he meant the other one I always mix up their names but still I can’t sell it, it was by far the hardest thing to get and I’m planning to craft Twilight after I finish Sunrise and I have only one gift completion left so yeah I can’t really do that
---
if you think the zerg is more important than roamers or even guilds you are wrong.
---
Im currently working on trying to get autoloot for my alt account so I recently spent some time trying to figure out the mastery points I could get, my recommendations:
---
LWS2 - If you play and play through this it has a ton of mastery points available
---
Triple Trouble - If you havent gotten all the achievements associated with this event, it has quite a few. 
---
Main storyline - If you havent played through the entire first storyline there is a ton for your first time through
---
Mastery insights - they recently added commune mastery insights throughout central tyria maps
---
Silver wastes - Each of the legendaries gives one+one for getting all four
---
Fractals ones are pretty easy to do in tier 1
---
Damnit, knew I should be playing Ele
---
First i thouht it was representative of Piken Square WvW population.
---
Nice art
---
Guess I’m farming Istan now thanks a lot I’ll check it out 
---
I feel like ANet has shot themselves in the foot -- which is something they seem to have been doing since release but it is far more pronounced now.
---
They are really inconsistent when it comes to their tech; they keep trying to revamp it or build 'new things to better help them in the future', but it really doesn't matter if they revamp things again a few months later.
---
The time they are trying to be consistent (LW releases) they aren't actually able to meet the unreasonable expectation that comes with them - they are expected to release a new map, with chieves, with story every few months. They are also expected to design the map in such a way for longevity...but how do you do that without a) reusing an old concept or b) failing to differentiate them from your previous maps?
---
I feel like they might be held back because they want to be able to monetize living world episodes, but this causes some tremendous issues. IMO, I think this model will go away after this season ends. It's just not sustainable, and the strain on the dev team and the playerbase is obvious. As others have stated, the fact that some of these cool interesting features are going to be silo'd away into individual episodes and almost never re-used in their future design (especially when they move onto a new expansion) is kind of saddening. 
---
The expectation is hurting, because if they don't release new maps, people will be annoyed, and if they change existing maps, people will be annoyed too. IMO, they have some really great maps in-game already; they should just reuse those for story content and add new areas to expand these zones for the episode, maybe opening up these areas for new hearts or stuff once the instance is completed. This would replace the need to re-rig or create new assets every time to make a whole new zone. It'd be nice to see what they did to Diessa or Snowden with that charr/norn village happen more often. Heck, maybe this'll give them a better excuse to do dungeons again. Stop charging for episodes, and just work on the maps they have and maybe release a new one every now and then (or save it for an expansion).
---
It's equal parts condition and power now. Power soulbeast can use mainhand axe for only a small drop in DPS in exchange for range.
---
And axe/axe is meta for PvP, very potent.
---
Renegade may be doing considerable damage but the Kalla's fervor mechanic is utterly negligible. Even though the minor traits alter how you gain ferver, it won't matter because whacking enemies for a bit is more than enough to get 5 stacks.
---
The spirits are still clunky to use because they consume energy or go on cooldown even when they're cc chained, rendering then useless. Why are Raner spirits immune while Renegade spirits aren't? Only one spirit is area denial and it pulses only 6 times, which is a much shorter duration than the rest.
---
Not to mention pathing, holly crap, don't get me started.
---
Shortbow skills like Spirit Crush and the 2nd skill should be able to rear-fire. Worst yet, Spirit Crush doesn't even auto turn your character. It's bizarre because these two skills in particular are animated to look like you can cast it from any angle. 
---
Berserker does decent condi damage, yes. But it's power variation is completely left uncompensated after several nerfs (Burst skill cast increase, Primal Bursts now a level 1 burst). Moreover, Power warrior and even spellbreaker perform on par if not better than Berserker with or without banners in PVE group content. For wvw/pvp, well, spellbreaker is just too good which I think is acceptable since it was designed that way. 
---
Elite specialization are not required but they offer something different to the play style (and often bring a bit of powercreep).
---
&gt;new spec requires me to use a greatsword
---
The new spec ALLOWS you to play with a GS but it is not mandatory at all.
---
For Condi Reaper I would direct you to [this wonderful trait](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Deathly_Chill) and to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQlCDbcrDns) that give you an overview of which trait might be interesting for you as well a basic rotation. You biggest money combe is 5+4 in Reaper shroud: Ice field (5) + Whirl  finisher (4) = many Chilling bolt --&gt; applies chill several times to your target --&gt; bleed. If you consider getting PoF, Scourge is a pretty good upgrade to Condi Necro.
---
That aside Power Reaper is pretty fun to use and can be nice in open world as you can burst down trash a bit faster than with a condi build and a full exotic zerk gear set is not that expensive. So I would definitively recommend that you give this one a try too. You can check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Horo_zky7ko) or [this build](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/necromancer/reaper/power/) or [that one](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Reaper_-_Power_Greatsword).
---
***
---
Story order is Core --&gt; LW season 1 (not playable) --&gt; LW season 2 --&gt; HoT --&gt; LW season 3 --&gt; PoF --&gt; LW season 4
---
If you have unlocked the episodes then you can start them whenever you want. You only had to connect "near" the release of an episode to unlock it and even if you do'nt have PoF you unlock the episodes but you will only be able to play them once you get PoF. For when you should buy them it depens how much gold/gems you have and how much you value the story/content of each episodes.
---
For Thief (and do try the Daredevil spec it has a bonus dodge and you can use a melee staff) you can get really offensive with zerk but if you feel too squishy take some Marauder/Valkyrie and [Invigorating Precision](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Invigorating_Precision) will be your best friend ina ny case!
---
Thanks for all the help.  Looking forward to jumping in there!  I might try a Soulbeast too ... who knows :D
---
At first it was "Well, I did everyone on my main, maybe I should try out other classes". Then it was "I want one of every class!". Then it was "I want an asura of every class!" 
---
And now, it's "I want a character for every specialization!". It's nice because it gives me a lot of different looks to try and I never have to worry about switching things over for a new spec. The stories are things I sort of pieced together in my head as I played them, which was an added benefit of trying new classes.
---
1) coming back from a 6 month break and I don't understand why are people saying agony resistance gives you 15% boon duration? I don't remember this being a thing back then
---
2) I need to update my fractal Chrono build. Basically I can just pick a snowcrows build and drop the pack runes for something else (they give 15% boon duration)? Or what else should I change? 
---
Roller Beetle anyone=?
---
not anytime soon
---
You can't transmute accessories at all, so...
---
Inconsistency Wars 2. Per usual.   
---
Ah well. i'll just find something else pretty to wear. Ty.
---
And all I wanted is that they added the Potent and the Enhanced Lucent Oil =/  
---
Yea, totally agree.
---
I need a toon of every specialisation. 
---
And if i get a good idea for a look. Then that's good enough to make a new one haha.
---
Well but this is exactly what happens with fractals... Not too long, not too easy but scaleable so that the higher tiers feel challenging. They just need to do one tiny mistake while designing a new fractal and nobody will run it except for when it's daily...
---
At least dungeons had relevant story within the boarders of what our character deals with anyways. Fractals are completely different and feel way more tucked on.
---
After you get used to it. It is a great, nay, excellent gaming experience. I wholeheartedly recommend it.
---
1)Large mobility option
---
2) I'd be careful with snowcrows. It kind of assumes you are perfect at chrono and all your allies will stand in wells. More concentration for your gear will probably be helpful. 
---
silicon heaven
---
It was most likely some empyreal shards brother, don't dwell too hard on it. 
---
when you die in wvw you became the lootbag!
---
But I want that achievement title and skin now, it isn't fair.
---
You could try [repairing](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/201863008-Repairing-the-Game-Client) your game if you haven't already since the other solutions haven't seemed to work for you.
---
If you're super lazy and have a bunch of alts collecting dust, use teleport to a friend to the end of the jumping puzzles for the  pearls or orchids and just park them there.  logging on characters to loot the chests takes less than a minute and gets you 3+ on each character daily and it adds up fast over a month's time.
---
Delete and make a usefull class maybe?
---
Solo group content. 
---
I need a sure confirmation about the x4 strikes on the mining tools. As far as i heard the only mining tool which is capable to x4 strike is the unbound magic one. 
---
I DUNNO.. they really might have fixed it but I'd like to be sure about it before spending 1000 gems on it.
---
Imagine we punch krakls teeth out in the season finale and they drop back into the mist only to become sentient beings we have to fight in the next raid wing. The gift of coalescence would basically require you to mix 50x\[Chip of Dragon's molar\], 50x\[Crystal Canine splinter\], 50x\[Branded Dragon's Jaw Dust\] and 250x\[Legendary Divination\]. 
---
Ironic.  
---
I'm being downvoted into oblivion. Am i wrong?
---
Its not about the skills but the stats on armor, weapons and trinkets mostly to calculate expertise and boon duration with ease along with runes, sigils and food
---
Just remove the scribe queue altogether, it's pointless, specially after they nerfed all the times down to 30 seconds.
---
I wish there was a guide for Multiboxing on Linux. One of the main reasons I stick to Windows...
---
Too bad those are harder than gw2
---
&gt;Well but this is exactly what happens with fractals... Not too long, not too easy but scaleable so that the higher tiers feel challenging. They just need to do one tiny mistake while designing a new fractal and nobody will run it except for when it's daily...

&gt;At least dungeons had relevant story within the boarders of what our character deals with anyways. Fractals are completely different and feel way more tucked on.
---
What is your point when you wrote that post? I think you are trying to make a point, but you aren't clear on your position. Did you want to make story instance turn into dungeons as the original poster intended to design it as or not? Because if you do, expect part of everything else of the content to suffer. Including story, map design, rewards, content. Or expect a dramatic increase in delays and time.
---
If there is going to be dungeons, make a new team for it and separate from living world releases. 
---
Dont lay dead :3 waypoint back immediately and you will get your loot(auto loot)
---
The consume all button is also a pretty small addition that one or two people probably worked on in their spare time. Redesigning a final boss would be a multiple team effort.
---
Suggestion: When a character dies, have another character feel they have to replace them and fulfill their legacy. It can lead to some great conflicts and thematic continuation.
---
Wait, you don't want to see my low-level armor on my grandpa character here? You want actual *discussions* to take place? How dare you!
---
100 gold?! You’re just a little off there.
---
It’s only 25 for the first four, 35 if you haven’t done the jackal heart the day you buy it.
---
Which video exactly? Link please?
---
I wanna see power/precision/ferocity/condi damage/expertise/boon duration. 
---
Sword pistol gives it away. Holo is the most likely choice for a sword/pistol combo, since medium armor rules out Chronos.
---
If "can't touch this" is taken yet, let's try: Mc Hammer. XD
---
Yes, you are wrong. Because you can't transmute any accessory, thus it is very consistent. 
---
Accessories doesn't have skins, and thus can't transmute. 
---
Maybe its because ive been playing a *ton* of Darksouls 3 this week... but this looks a LOT like something out of Dark Souls.
---
Yeah, some sort of "ingame blog" could help as well. Some place where people is able to write stuff and link to various resources.
---
Players shouldn't be forced to go outside the game to socialize with their guildmates.
---
But how will they make us throw away tons of mats between updates when they nerf one combination and buff another?
---
This is really, really cool.  
---
I wish I could just copy paste this onto my mesmer  TBH  
---
&gt; ... Is this normal, too?
---
&gt; Yeah. It is.
---
Comedy comedy comedy *deep existential dread* comedy.
---
Ahh, the Monstrum pattern asserts itself beautifully again.
---
I don't really have a problem with art of fashion wars posts.  They're something that most people can relate to and if you don't like them then just hide them with RES.  It's not a huge deal because the shoddier jobs don't make the front page.  
---
I agree with you, so so much.
---
If I have ONE problem with Anet's design philosophy is this: GW2 is a "fast food" MMO.
---
I *honestly* believe that people are going the extra mile by praising the longevity of the MMO when most of the content is achievement hunting and fashion wars, and the thing is, Anet seems to design things not with longevity in mind, but in consuming fast, playing now, and waiting. 
---
The problem with some achievements and activities in Open World, Serpent's Ire and the related achievements for example, is that most of them are not attractive enough for the vast majority of the player base, and unless you're playing the game at around the time the expansion or new episode is launched, you're not gonna be able to complete it later. This problem started since HoT, where maps move according to a schedule and in order to explore them you need metas with many people to open certain areas. As someone who works and has not much time to play GW2 each night, this started pushing me further away from coming back. It took me THREE YEARS to get a full HoT map, solo, thanks to mounts and a fully geared Minionmancer Reaper, there was no other way I would ever be able to complete Heart of Maguuma as I never actually could play at the same time the events happened.
---
And that's one huge issue with this game... Anet never, ever comes back, they design without thinking on the consequences. People pray for new maps like Maguuma full of metas and good rewards but, when the people that has been playing the Maguuma metas gets tired of them and moves to the new meta maps... How are people supposed to complete Heart of Maguuma? Did Anet SERIOUSLY never thought about that? Then we have some very lazy and short sighted desitions being taken, we can see this problem already with Serpent's Ire.
---
Each map is just putting more wood into the bonfire of things we might not touch again. There are many maps, especially from this LWS, that already feel dead and abandoned. 
---
Anet really should start looking back into things and using all what they have created and forsaken for years. Core Tyria has many interesting locales (The Wizard's Tower...) that are never touched upon, Core Tyria, just like the new maps, is a place you just explore and never touch again after some time...
---
I don't want a disposable MMO or a Side MMO anymore, I want the devs to put their stuff together and reanimate Tyria, not giving us an apetizer every two months that ends up being more a cheap snack, as we'll have to wait long for the main course again.
---
no, I don't have any WP to thunderhead at all. I can see the quest objective green icon that says dragonsblood but I can't get to it at all. I have been away from this game for 5 years and came back after seeing the expansions on sale I sure am regretting it now. wasn't aware I had to buy missions as well.

&gt; obvious duels
---
Care to share, say, 3 signs a duel is obvious, compared to just a pair of roamers messing with each other, or someone trying to prevent an enemy player from heading somewhere else?
---
For those of us who can't instantly tell when we're on our own way somewhere and want to help a teammate who may not have time to type "Yo, duel" in chat every time someone comes in render distance.
---
Guild Halls should have been built with GvG in mind.
---
The halls we have now suck, but imagine they had been built with siege battles in mind. The map itself would be an empty, with a castle in the middle, including walls and doors.
---
Then your guild would be able to "queue" in a guild battle system, allowing other guilds to challenge them and assault their guild hall. The winners would get rewards for their guild, like new banner decorations, new anthems, etc. Players would also be able to hire NPC guards, and customize their appearance and abilities.
---
Give that system a queue, and you would have guilds competing against each other all the time. Remove the decoration system (it's good for player housing, but sucks for guild halls) and replace it with a fortress-building system, where you can design your own castle layout by combining predefined sets.
---
Hmm that's not a bad idea. I don't have a problem getting pearls , but for orchids that might be the way to go.
---
Yeah, after several years, I got The Legend from a chest in AB after the meta.
---
Got zero really valuable drops before that week, then in 3 days I got that and Tequatl's Hoard...then nothing else noteworthy since.
---
We need guild events first. A calendar is pointless if guilds are pointless in the first place.
---
This game is severely lacking on community-driven activities.
---
 I was getting half the framerate that I did with Lutris, but hopefully that can be fixed if I set the environment variables the same way as the Lutris installer script does. Gonna test this later. 
---
&gt;* Is it too much of a waste to select Core + HoT stats ascended trinkets as Berserker instead of a HoT stat (say, Marauder)?
---
No, if you don't need the extra vitality then Berserker is still the best power option
---
&gt;* Is it ok to use Marauder trinkets instead of Berserker for Raids and T4/CM Fractals?
---
If you use Marauder, you'll lose out on maybe 10% DPS, but if you're one-shot by an enemy, you'll lose out on 100% DPS. Use it if you need to
---
Was there a balance patch on 8th Jan?
---
Didn't notice anything of worth.
---
Thanks! The asura names aren't surnames, they're all titles, jobs, or hobbies. As for Sylvari... Yes, this is true, but it was kinda necessary since most singular name versions are taken, sadly. Since they're both "individualistic" Sylvari, I like the idea that they saw fit to give themselves surnames or something.
---
Wow. Very detailed! This looks amazing. 
---
Dual swords? Mesmer, Power chrono is now a beast in any game modes
---
Obviously I'm a bit biased but... I don't see the harm in it as long as it doesn't go overboard. There's nothing currently happening in the game (because, well, the big thing that happened in the last living story has been talked about to death and our next update is a balance patch/league update that we don't know anything about yet), and the subreddit has been dragging along. If there were quality discussions to be had and low quality memes were drowning out that discussion, it'd be another thing.
---
I can't check it out right now but was Soul Pastry and the lucent oils added to nourishment and enhancement sections?
---
People want exposure and conversation and feedback. GuildWarsDyeJob is very small compared to this sub(by an order of magnitude). Most posts have a handful of responses, while the front page character posts here have dozens- of course people are going to post here. The population isn't large enough to sustain multiple subs.
---
And like other people have said, it's not like these posts are interrupting the riveting discourse taking place here.
---
I feel like it's more effort than most memes. The posts that are getting karma seem to have a lot of thought put into fashion wars (the musketeer, for example). That said, there's a sub for that which doesn't get much love so they should go there.
---
There are some great answers already , just adding what I haven't seen yet :
---
Population is very good , still plenty of players and more new one joining all the time. 
---
There is a TON of PVE content of all kinds , and 2 PVP modes that are quite fun , although they have some flaws. BUT sPVP and WVW actually have REWARDS attached to them , very good ones, which is quite unusual in a PVE focused MMO.
---
The free to play game has a good amount of content , but if you try it and like it , definitely get the expansions. They add A LOT of value and a LOAD of stuff to do.
---
The expansions go on sale for 50% off pretty often, and when one is on sale you can USUALLY bundle them together and get the 50% off on both. I did , got them both together for $27 . There are also several official trusted third party sellers where they're almost always discounted , like dlcgamer .
---
head mesmer chrono rotation is really hard, but idk why tbh
---
is called bromance?
---
...human grandpa in low-level clothes made the first page. Plus, it's mostly humans. If someone makes a Charr or Asura that looks impressive, I'd love to see *that* because that takes genuine effort and creativity.
---
Already way ahead of you my friend.
---
Half the fun of writing a story is trying different what-if scenarios and arcs to see which one feels the most compelling and cohesive.
---
All or Nothing was released, making Diviner's gear accessible, which is hybrid DPS/boon duration gear.
---
The build editor didn't reflect the December changes until today, either, so this is a big update. 
---
Ok so I guess my original question should have been, How do you get the magic find buff from the meta on a level 53 toon to open unidentified gear bags without increasing the level of your level 53 toon?
---
Karma farm on this sub? Here you get 400-500 upvotes at best, rarely there is a post with 1000+ upvotes. Much easier on the large subs like r/dankmemes.
---
And its great to see good gw2 memes here by the way, should be more instead of the tons of "I just bought the game", "HoT or PoF first" and "help me select a profession" posts.
---
Because the nodes for gathering there (the ones you use the sickle for) yield 3x.
---
With most gathering/harvesting nodes this means pressing F and waiting for the animation 3x.
---
With the UB tool, you hit F once, watch one (quick) animation, and it gathers all 3 at once.
---
Would you believe a guy got reddit gold some weeks ago because he considered all this to be part of a "perfectly good business model"?
---
I at least appreciate when people will find a locale that is special to them, set up a pose or scene, and then take the screenshot. Instead it's just "neutral stance/neutral expression/neutral background" for 4 posts back-to-back
---
Ah ok, Diviner gear.
---
Tfw you are the only one who makes a new pot... Ungrateful bastards. All of them.
---
could you send me a rotation video for the mesmer
---
and if you can daredevil
---
They already have a hefty "cut" taken out on each side of the gold to gems algorithm to prevent easy flipping , so you can't flip gold to gems then gems to gold from a small market fluctuation and still make any profit. I wouldn't put anything past any company that has lootboxes and a cash shop , normally , but I don't think they actually do any "fixing".
---
Don't look at me, I'm the one making the coffee and a pot of hot cocoa for the "I don't drink coffee" family members at my home
---
Actually it's Abaddon's symbol, my character is wearing [Relic of Abaddon](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Relic_of_Abaddon), but I tried to give him the effect of [Embrace the Darkness](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Embrace_the_Darkness).
---
you sure you weren't getting blood linked by the moa and just didn't see the animation?  that would be the only thing i could think of if you weren't in melee range of the moa.
---
I'm at work and browsing YouTube or something for such a video would get me in trouble.
---
But there should be plenty to view there. I do apologize that I can't currently provide some examples however.
---
Thattt is actually very clever. I'll have to remember that as a good way to mix up my names.
---
Too many fashion wars elitists in this thread...   
---
   
---
But seriously, this sub would be dead without all these art/fashion posts. They aren't really my cup of tea but reality is that most of the time there's really not much happening in the game.    
---
LF raid guild speed clear EU
---
Congrats. You have something. Good. But why post here? It is nothing special anymore. 
---
Interesting :)
---
Gw2 characters being posted in a Gw2 sub? Riot!

I find it funny using the word "Retiring", like raiding was a job for them, some kind of Esport of some sort.
---
I really dont know why people have to take this so serious has to make a twitter post of their retirement.. It's a MMORPG, chill.
---
Yea true. Someone coming from mythic raiding in WoW i just have a hard time finding accurate information on these things. There’s no icy veins for gw2 it seems. ( new player have had it since launch never got into game till a few days ago )
---
We all get older and there's really no reason to turn away perfectly good dick!
---
Take a seat.
---
Wait, pets have gap closers? Haven't gotten to rock gazelle yet but working on that.   
---
Currently changed GS and LB  for A/A and SW/A, might swap the A/A back to GS though.   
---
Axe 5 is pretty OP, but I'm not complaining :P
---
That's all yours then 😬
---
It's not possible to push out raids fast enough to keep raiders happy. Literally impossible. They beat them in a day to a week , and then it's just a farm until they're tired of it. Also , hardcore raiders are a minority in EVERY MMO , even raid focused ones , which GW2 is not.
---
The casuals claim another
---
I know a lot of you guys like to poke fun cause it's DnT (which does have merit albeit), but it is kinda sad to see another Raiding guild go under. It feels like especially the more hardcore scene has just been falling apart day by day for awhile now. 
---
Not sure if it's a stale meta, lack of content, or some combination of the two, but its sad to see any guild go.
---
The only hard thing about weaver is staff builds. Sword/d and FA builds are much much easier. 
---
The only thing that really can cost a lot of dps is going into the wrong attunement. Conjures can also be tricky for someone who has no interest in learning at all, but they can be avoided to a certain extent. 
---
Hardcore raiders are a minority in EVERY MMO , even raid focused ones. They should not be catered to at the expense of other content. Raids are one form of content , like anything else , that is there to do or not do , and there will always be people done with raiding , and people looking to start raiding.
---
Not really a surprise. DnT has been losing relevance for a long time in multiple games.
---
That said, as bleeding cocky as Nike's post is, DnT really did set the tone for a lot of early GW2 media. I remember watching Strife's guardian videos in particular, and Brazil's "Eugene" comedy videos and really enjoying them. But then everyone got serious, and then got boring as a result of too much seriousness.
---
This really feels like it needs an example to make sense.
---
The DPS rotation is considered hard because of timing the Continuum Splits during the pre/after cast of other skills - you'll be chucking out tons of illusions and phantasms, and shattering them as quickly as they're generated.
---
The support rotation is considered difficult because of timing your wells and other skills to maximize boon uptimes for the rest of your group.
---
Ahh, very well! Might as well stick to A/A in that case.   
---
Retiring doesn't always mean from a job: "withdraw to or from a particular place."  Such as: "I am retiring to my room."  In this case the place is raiding.  Some people really take games seriously or are heavily invested in them.  Others take working out or sports incredibly seriously and some step back eventually.  Why shit on someone just because you don't share their interests?  It's very small minded.
---
If you are EU, you can whisper me, I can show you the basics.
---
Not Charr. -1 fashion point
---
Nvidia shadowplay is your best friend
---
Sure, but it's super generic. You want to tell a story or really show off your look, find a good locale. You want to evoke an emotion, take a screenshot in combat (there are a ton of low-level, low-danger enemies you can scope out in starting areas, then Ctrl + Shift + H to hide the HUD and show off some action poses.)
---
Or strike a pose somewhere, do something. But just screenshotting on the login screen gets so old. And once one person does it, 5 others follow shortly after, logging in seemingly to take a quick screenshot for sake of posting fast to follow the trend. It's tiring that it happens every couple days. I think people would be happier if some real effort or time was spent on finding that pose or action shot or something. This is pinnacle low-effort though. The Charr one with the magma infusion? That was really cool, posed in front of a volcanic area. Let's see more of that level of effort tbh.
---
If you're having to google ANY LS boss(es), then you are a special one.
---
&gt;Removing what brings a lot of activity can have unintended effects
---
Exactly, I remember /r/Overwatch had a similar problem with Play of the Game posts, so they had a period where no highlights were allowed and the finding were "The subreddit is really empty with only discussion posts". 
---
And a couple of months later people are saying "We have a seperate subreddit for these posts, let's remove them" all over again.
---
Hell, [here's a freakily similar scenario to this very post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/a0sk6n/can_potgs_have_their_own_subreddit/?st=jr6l3zy5&amp;sh=c851e066).
---
ask for a rollback to the old system? this happen because many complained about not having enough when HoT released and was so much the complain I remember I was finishing TD on second day when Mike O give the announcement including reducing the requirements of masteries for story mode. (literally the fully spected were chars with world completition.)
---
Another guild bites the dust. Maybe we'll actually get consistent endgame content at some point but I'm not going to hold my breath and wait.
---
The core game is f2p and there is little the DLC offer you in early stages of the game. Go f2p, see if you like it. Finish personal story and then decide if you want to go for the expansions.
---
Ah yes, the good old: "It is not that hard". 
---
We have no idea how easy or how hard it would be. It does however require more than just adding a category to the menu. 
---
"Art and Fashion" are part of the endgame in most MMO (and esp. in GW2), so ,**for me**, are welcome here.
---
I like it but, and this is probably more a comment on my depravity, I can't unsee the penis.
---
Anet, buy this one as a loading screenshot for Pvp loading screenshots!
---
Yea, yea, yea.   
---
And then there's the folks that use this as their excuse to be grade A douchebags to everyone.   
---
Some minority of the populace will always suck.  The only question is if you'll choose to join the club by being an asshole, apathetic, or both.
---
There's a dedicated sub-forum for that: /r/GuildWars2Funny
---
Check the [rules](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules).
---
You sound salty and offended, for what reason and for what joy?
---
&gt; that work
---
in what way? random everything will still work. weapons have leaning towards one of 2 damage types condi or power - what do you mean by uncommon using one type on the other type's build, or using melee weapons on ranged build.
---
Take any pvp build and use it in pve - there you have uncommon non meta builds (no reason to post them)
---
Take any pve meta and use it in pvp - there you have uncommon non meta builds (no reason to post them either)
---
Take any random traits and utilities... what do you expect to see, is what i'm wondering about here.
---
Let me get this straight because its your birthday you want back even though you were probably banned for being a douche. I mean this is sound logic if somebody doesn't agree to this they must be mad. 
---
&gt;	a pretty small addition that one or two people probably worked on in their spare time
---
You are the kind of person I hate at my job.
---
"It seems small to me, and since i have no frame of reference or actual connection to the task, I'll just assume that it's something easy and straightforward, that the people responsible for it knocked it out with zero effort, that they were otherwise just gonna sit around skiing nothing in their "spare time", and that very few resources went into it.
---
"These assumptions *must* be true, because otherwise it's really make my opinion on it nonsensical...therefore this is how it's got to be."
---
There was this post about a boyfriend/girlfriend norn and sylvari, both in a generic armor set (a set - no mixing of pieces, a standard freakin set) that showed up in my reddit feed. Who upvotes this stuff? 
---
I got it when I came back to the game as someone told me it was the best place since I had 4K gems from the deluxe version. I’ve met quite a few nice people there that have helped. If you like cosmetics and fashion there is lots of that. I prob spent a few hours looking at people’s gear and making a list of stuff I wanna aim for 😂
---
If Anet has trademarked the name no. Best asking a dev about this.
---
I am neither. Such a small thing would never be enough to make me offended , and it has literally no effect on me , or anyone really that isn't in DnT , so I am not salty either. 
---
That combo would be great not only for condi druid.
---
I am amused Snargle didn't figure out the Eir &gt; Braham connection until now.
---
Even better :&gt;
---
Can't be disputed
---
While I agree the world was more colourful then most people think, its wasn't really the norm for everyone. Certain colours were far cheaper than other ones. Furthermore colours fade quickly under sunlight and quality wasn't good either. Peasantry worked a lot of time on the field, pasture etc. Clothes weren't replaced often either. Thats why most people have a rather greyish/brown look in their mind when they think of medieval times. An army started colourful and ended as a grey mass (descrptions of agincourt) after some time. Colour was a strong status symbol, easy to show off and much more comfortable either if its made of better quality. I guess one has to differentiate between Villages and towns. The more costly, brighter colours wouldn't be available for people unable to travel to a bigger town with imports. And most people weren't able to travel.
---
Hardcore players are nearly the most important part of the raid community. Finding out strategies, creating a meta making the game look interesting on twitch/YouTube.
---
Without maybe of the hardcore players dungeons, fractals and raids would have died much earlier then they did
---
4k subscribers, 6 online currently, what a joke of a subreddit... basically no one sees your content there.
---
About these rules: I have posted multiple memes to this sub in the past 4 months and they not only did not get removed but got hundreds of upvotes in fact. 
---
So I say again, we need more memes and less of those posts I mentioned above
---
 Implying fractals are dead makes me wonder how much you play , actually.
---
nah, was after HoT launch... is a long story... Funny enough I arrived to the game 8 months before HoT so I got to see this happen.
---
So I saw this shift and liked the reason why.
---
But mostly I will say was either overhype and not delivering the promises or Not hyping too much and deliver the content promised.
---
As someone who was new, I sided with the later easy while many vets complained about the new stances.
---
He knew it, it was a flashback scene.  You can see Past Braham having his old hair.
---
sweet dreams you have there 
---
Mostly gw1 though;) and that's better IMO
---
Yeeaaaaahhhh... it's... it's not great :(
---
I'm going to ignore your pathetic attempts at name calling, and address the subject at hand.
---
There's nothing inherently wrong with people wanting to willfully be bad and having no desire to improve. The problem arises when these people demand everything be dumbed down to their level.
---
Just because there are people that are willing to speak the truth about the situation, does not make them a "grade A douchebag" or whatever else you want to call them; doing so, does however, make you look childish.
---
Going through comments here... gg nike, succesful bait
---
yeah dont be surprised when new players are running around in nomad warrior and you wonder why the octos reset LUL
---
You already admitted you rarely even log on . I do. I still see plenty of new people. PLENTY. And when we have a raid slot open , or training runs , there is no shortage of people who want in , and if we stoop to advertising a slot , like if we want to start a whole new raiding squad split from one of our main squads, we have no trouble finding people who want to try it out. Does that mean they want to be in a static group for the next year running raids ? Probably not , nor should they. That is stupid , it's an old idea , it doesn't fit GW2 , and the MMO genre has passed it by.
---
Old DnT was definitely better.  It was about them clearing content quick and having fun.  Then it became about their egos even when they weren't the best and it all went downhill.
---
Yes, both were added
---
My bf and I joined a guild that had told us at recruitment they "weren't sticklers for the meta" in terms of T4 Fractals/Raiding, and that they valued that a person knew what they were doing with their build more than strictly adhering to a given meta. So if you were pumping out ~15k damage as opposed to ~17k damage, that would be fine as long as you could follow direction and your build worked for you/you were actively contributing with such a build.
---
Then last night, after months of gearing and preparing several characters, my bf was told that in order to raid with the guild he had to adhere to several meta sites and the builds presented there. He was pulling close to the "allowable" damage threshold without having eaten any food, being boosted by Might or Alacrity, and no other such boosts/benefits, but it didn't matter.
---
If you aren't doing exactly what the meta says "has to be done," people don't care that your DPS is 1k short w/o boosts/food compared to a build w/ boosts/food, you aren't meta, your build is automatically considered "garbage."
---
I gave it a go to follow the meta on several characters, but the weapons/playstyles do *not* click with me. So I guess I'm sitting out of the raiding scene. Oops.
---
most of the builds are nonbrainer also there's always metabattle...
---
what it comes down too are mostly rotations
---
I mean, WoW used to have those as a main major patch feature. and they kind of proud of it. dunno why i couldnt stop thinking that other company might do the same thing
---
In protest of what
---
While it's kinda related to 1, I would see an "expansion feature" as being an entirely new region, i.e. Cantha, The Mists, The Void, something along those lines that hasn't been seen in the world already.
---
Elite specs are a tricky one, as shipping them two or three at a time is weird. Not to say they wouldn't do that, but I think it's more likely for them to do something like "Hey, season 5 is starting. If you have all of season 4 you will have new elite specs".
---
toxic femoid
---
When you transcend the need for glowy particle effects and you just aim for style instead.
---
Problem I have with staff is it's best attack is pretty much auto-attack. I find myself with a full stack of initiative so often because I do almost as much damage with the triple string and ground pound dodge as I do using skills.
---
&gt; About these rules: I have posted multiple memes to this sub in the past 4 months and they not only did not get removed but got hundreds of upvotes in fact. 
---
So, you basically proved my point. Thanks!
---
Haha that's good point. but come on , that's a pretty obvious one. You have to be a real fuck-up to be 80 and not even understand stats. Squeezing out that last 10% of dps is not the same as running around as a warrior in nomad, with longbow , and signets , and wondering what's happening.
---
especially the one with the legendary weapon/armor/backpack/trinket. its like everyone will wear the same armor, weapon, and accessory in 10 years.
---
I know.
---
The very notion is absurd.
---
Yea I bought $35worth of gems and when I went to buy $100 worth they were like nope 👎 how do you contact support to get this flag removed?
---
That isn't the fault of the meta.  That's the fault of the guild you joined **lying** to you about their goals and expectations. 
---
That's the main point to me as well.
---
It's even possible to completely filter out content people don't want to see. Seems like a non-issue to me. 
---
I also enjoy most of the gw2 memes for example, but they don't add any "value" according to the sub rules either. 
---
People just love to complain imho.
---
The high end scene hasn't been the same for ages now, judging by the amounts of actual speedruns coming out or people actually competing with each other so eh. 
---
Watch out, if you bully him he might drop a 30 min video on you analysing every word!
---
then what is the important content? One-off singleplayer story instances and maps that die in a week?
---
"Lack of content"?
---
Did you mean "lack of content I am personally interested in"?...because there's an absurd amount of content in GW2, which only a very small fraction of the playerbase has actually completed.
---
For someone not affected at all, you've spent quite some time posting comments on this post.
---
Except the players who would do 7% less dps are those who already know their classes in detail and are fully capable of making a good build on their own. They, however, are a very very small minority. The vast majority will either play outdated meta builds, copy builds from someone else, or play utter trash builds. This will be especially an issue in pugs and may kill the pugging altogether.
---
Long (and political) story, but the gist of it is that Patreon banned someone for something they said on a different person's stream, that the first person wasn't getting any Patreon money for. Whether you think they deserved it or not, people are worried since Patreon has control over their income.
---
That is a valid point, the guild did deceive us. However I find that more raid players are sticklers for meta than not. My guild lied, but I have been hard-pressed to find a guild (before and since joining this one) at all that would allow anything but meta builds for raids, hence my excitement at joining this one and dismay at finding that out  And all I hear are horror stories regarding Pugs, so  that doesn't sound like the most viable second option.
---
Well, if you have both expansions you should have 2 free slots correct? 1 will have your instant 80s in it if you've never used them, but what else would you put in them?
---
I would say that those are AS important as raids , yes. I sure saw a shit load more posts on here wanting to discuss the new LW story and it's implications, than I see about raiding. 
---
Have you try to run GW2 without a wine installation ? If i uninstall winehq (on a Debian Buster) the launcher is just a black window (but OK with winehq).
---
#worldfirst raiding comeback?
---
This right here, that screech is what puts a ton of people down. There is no AoE marker on the ground for it, you just have to see when it raises it head and screeches at the sky.
---
GW2 also simply lacks group content. There is no casual or coregamer group content besides dungeons and like 1 fractal each year. So teamoriented players barely play GW2, which means there is no pool of players which could get into raiding.
---
GW2 either caters to pretty hardcoreplayers (raids) or extremly casual solo players (open world). The (usually) huge group in between is missing - which means it's difficult to recruit players.
---
Here come the friendliest community with their friendly comments. lmao
---
OP, you don't need some trash discord to enjoy the game. Find a guild and have fun.
---
well yeah, the episode came out recently and the last raid has been out for a while. 
---
They're so good I had no idea who they were up until now.
---
Mouth breather trying to steal a title up in here. Good catch
---
21:9 is amazing, but, you don't have to go 3440x1440 (which would also probably mean a serious hardware upgrade). I'm really happy using 2560x1080, and when I switched, I wished I'd done it earlier.
---
Well , that's the point of Reddit. That's like saying "you're in a steakhouse , but why are you eating?" . Doesn't mean I give a shit on some PERSONAL level. That would be as strange as the clown who thought it was important to let people know he was SO DONE with raiding , guys.
---
yeah healer quickbrand is so much more broken than druid /s
---
Tengu had as well, and it's working fine.
---
It's not the intent, it's the *height* that matters.
---
Are you too brick minded to get the point or do you just pretend to be?  
---
The „other games manage to push out more“ was an answer to the reply above.  
---
What tilts me beyond infinity is the statement they could push out 6 wings a year when the release schedule has went to shits right around that time regarding ALL content. Last year was just pathetic. How fucking out of the loop of your own company can you be?
---
"Is that truth, or have you heard it on Cantha News Network?"
---
I saw the bubble but was far away from it. Neither was i targeted by her laser when i started taking heavy damage.
---
Does the bubble have a waaay larger hitbox than its visuals indicate?
---
[you think youre cute](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/a9onai/how_are_others_so_much_stronger_than_me_how_do_i/) 
---
But you cant argue the game is casual that people can just run whatever and still kill shit and then turn around and say *oh people are gonna notice if they arent doing damage* So thats your logic out the door right there
---
I mean , GW2 makes no secret that the Living World and stories etc are large part of their priorities. Why is that a surprise ?
---
I have three screens at work. When I get home and only have one I feel sad. Being able to play a game and watch YouTube or easily look up a guide would be a dream.
---
I think you might be missing the convenience factor of the Lounge Passes. Everyone I know has purchased a Lounge Pass with real money, I personally have 3 (Royal Terrace, Free one from PoF Pre-Order, and the Mistlock. The selling point of the passes is that it's a double click to end up in an area where the most walking you do is 5 away seconds. They also have a variety of merchants in close proximity that are spread out through the cities. The Mistlock has a fractal entrance and fractal merchants in it. The biggest selling point is pure convenience. I don't have to run around a city or Lions Arch looking for a single merchant or figure out where things are. In the Mistlock specifically I can access, a merchant, BLTC, and my Bank by standing in one spot and not have to move. 
---
lets be real this is basically just an art sub at this point
---
bonus point if it has a title like "My Girlfriend Commissioned A Drawing of My Charr And It Looks Great! :3" 
---
I didn't downvote nor upvote you
---
I personally wouldn't mind if it took awhile if they'd just buff HoT elite specs (at least the ones that were left in a bad state like scrapper and zerker). If they don't do that though, I would like new ones sooner rather than later.
---
Why is this?
---
Fresh air tempest with staff. Pretty sure it can be found on metabattle/youtube as it used to be very strong during HoT.
---
you overestimate players in gw lul
---
I never said it wasn't. I'm asking you what you think they should be focusing on if not raids, and I used the most consistently updated content as an example.
---
[He's fine. It's fine.](https://commanderyes.tumblr.com/post/181882018557/its-all-over-but-the-crying)
---
It does have a larger hitbox then showing. So move off or dodge through. Also check your buff bar, if you have confusion on you, do not hit anything since until you cleansed it or it wear off. 
---
Not really. Cause those fuck-ups definitely exist and GW2 punishes them a lot less than other games. But honestly , and sorry , I'm not sure what you are actually saying in this particular post , it's pretty jumbled.
---
there are raid training discords out there for both servers
---
Pretty much, yeah.
---
Eh, just ignore the discord thing, find a guild of like-minded people and enjoy the game. You don't have to bow down to kids on power trip.
---
Twins shouldn't kiss...
---
I'm guessing one of the script writers at Arenanet was inspired by someone at Arenanet?
---
Good point about the regions.
---
As for the buy-in to unlock specs... Yeah that's tricky. But S4 was included with PoF. There's nothing to say that S5 will be.(is there?) Maybe it will require a season pass purchase or something.
---
I think they should do what they're doing. A mix of stuff, a fractal occasionally , a new map and story here and there  , a raid occasionally. 
---
Very good.
---
The biggest surprise here is how long it took them to do this.
---
Finally, the long awaited balance to the rewards. Istan was just way too lucrative!
---
It's not sad if its true
---
And then once I know the raid, go into Pugs, which people post horror stories about?
---
Or submit to a meta build that doesn't really click for me in order to get into a guild raiding scene, and then suck at said build?
---
And that's not to mention that often I see these offers for raid training requesting the players utilize a Snowcrows build or some such.
---
And yet you're not mad at the people who are saying it wouldn't be a lot of effort to remake an entire story instance and final boss fight? You don't have to be a programmer to tell that a menu feature is less work than remaking an entire dungeon.
---
&gt; I didn't downvote nor upvote you
---
Didn't say you did. When I wrote that I had about -3. When I said "I'm being downvoted and you're disagreeing" they were two separate statements to introduce my point about the timeline *shrug* 
---
&gt;Death and Taxes has been, without a doubt, the greatest guild in the history of the game

&gt;they don't go here
---
That's just your opinion. Do I like every fashionwars post that goes here? No. Do I think the majority are Yet Another Overly Flashy Character™? Yes. Does that mean that they "shouldn't" go here? No.
---
Nah, honestly i think having that as a whole seperate sub is actually a misstep, that's great content for here.
---
I don't know. Call me cynical but I've been playing online games and mmo's for a long time and developers usually tend to use vague language on controversial changes.
---
I personally interpret that paragraph as they "aren't doing another another expansion in the foreseeable future and will instead try to put more content into patches".
---
You can see why that would be a controversial statement so they worded it differently / vaguely to try and not scare people away from the game.
---
I wouldn't be surprised due to the games age, it's probably not worth the time investment to do a two year development cycle for a $60 content dump when they can make one map in 3-4 months, add a bunch of features and rewards that take a shit load of resources which a lot of people would just buy gold for.

Well, asura holomancy has been established for a long time, and can be seen in multiple locations across the game. Elonian holomancy is practiced by a single NPC in the whole world, and we don't see it anywhere else. Not even the Zephyrites (who have been using those crystals for centuries) show signs of knowing about Elonian holomancy.
---
If you don't have a problem with that, well, to each his own. I can tell when something was pulled out the ass in the last minute, and elite specialization lore qualifies right into that.
---
Economic damage has been done, so say hello to another currency in LS5.
---
not even
---
Now buff PoF metas please. 
---
They emphasized living world being free updates in one of their prior videos (I think the sixth anniversary one) so I dunno if they'll start charging.
---
PoF has metas? /s
---
lmao this kralks me up
---
I made them up on the fly, trying to respect the originals as much as possible.
---
With better elite specialization design we could get better lore. Some elite specs are incredibly bland, like the tempest. I think they should build all elite specs with a theme on mind, not just "let's stick all these new random skills together".
---
No more than 3 days ago I've seen someone complaining anet doesn't have balls to nerf Istan. Fun times.
---
*~~CHINA~~ CANTHA*
---
Snowcrows is the current foty site for all builds, guides and video postings. 
---
Thing is, a more dedicated/focused sub doesn't automatically make it a rule not to post stuff on the main sub. If I set up /r/gw2livingstory that wouldn't automatically make it "wrong" to post LS theories on /r/guildwars2.
---
Google translate copy pasta doesn't count.
---
I would agree if the endgame of this game wasn't called fashion wars haha. These posts don't bother me at all. 
---
I speak the languages.
---
Hello, I cant decide between Necromancer and Thief. Would anyone mind giving me pros and cons on them and why you like them?
---
They don't have the tecnology...
---
Being angry and frustrated isn't going to help you get into raiding.  I understand being frustrated and wanting to blow off steam, but don't blame the "meta" that's irresponsible.  Sometimes you join a shitty group or a shitty guild that doesn't match with your goals or expectations.  *It happens.*  The reason that the meta exists is so that people can have standards for comparison.  In my opinion, if you're a decent player you should be able to build a little trust via the meta *first* and then flexing whatever build you want to run once people trust you more.  
---
You fluently speak English, French, German and Spanish? That is talent my dude.
---
Thank the internet I learned English as a kid, been trying to learn a new language as an adult now and it's not going well...
---
So essentially Istan will be dead so people will move to other sources like Lake Doric or RIBA, cool I guess, RIP main money maker, want people to do other metas? Make them worthwhile, why in the fuck would someone go through other shitty metas and waste their time for jack shit when you can do something else that is much more worth your time?
---
Yep , the meta clones and jackasses ARE the same ones as the so-called hardcore raiders , and rather than being the ones keeping raiding alive , they are the ones doing it the most harm. But they won't see it.
---
Here's an idea - if you don't want people to fixate on one area of the game (such as Istan), then why don't you go back and BUFF old rewards instead of nerfing new ones?
---
No one does dungeons anymore. There are tons of maps with metas that hardly anyone does, because they aren't worth it. Fix those. :/
---
&gt;inb4 will never happen lol
---
If they had the balls they would have made it when it wouldn't represent a bigger problem.
---
I was expecting a drowned cat joke here.... Guess the Searing still stings.
---
Thank you very much for your help :)
---
That's crazy, thanks for the info!
---
Or put a barrel of Branded-Be-Gone spears from the latest episode, making CC more available ?
---
Holy shit dude! If any anet is reading this: this was a JOKE! DO NOT IMPLEMENT SOCIAL FEATURES LIKE THIS!
---
If I'm not good with the "meta" builds, then what's the point? "Build a little trust via the meta" yeah no thanks. I suck with meta builds. So I'm just gonna continue with my "crap" build that can carry my fractal groups just fine and sit Raids out. It's not worth struggling to match the moving goalposts that is the meta.
---
Thank you very much for your help :) I will give Daredevil a try, sure why not :) it is also wonderful that I am not forced to use GS, I'm perfectly fine with having a 1 "trait line?" for reaper but not using the weapon. 
---
Here's a name from way back. I honestly didn't even know DnT was still a thing, they've disappeared from so many other mmos Ive played I fure they all but dissolved by now
---
Well, then they're still dumb because not only people won't come back to Istan, they still have no other reasons to go to the rest of the maps.
---
&gt;	And yet you’re not mad at the people who are saying it wouldn’t be a lot of effort to remake an entire story instance and final boss fight?
---
I never said that.
---
A good change imho, now they need to fix pof metas and put them on a timer.
---
Same goes with the other season4 maps, put the metas on a timer and people will play them.
---
I'll agree all of those do sound obvious, but I feel like they're not common enough. The last few times I've gotten flack for 'interfering' it was a fight between two players right on the sentry ring on Alpine south camp - not off to the side, or out of the way at all.
---
The kind of dueling people seem to be aching for is the kind I remember from 2012 - where people gathered and sat south of the orchard, you did /wave if you werent participating, /bow if you were, people squared off. It was pretty fun to watch and occasionally participate in.
---
Now, we're in the era of "outnumbered only roamer massacre" youtube videos, and I feel like dueling in general just doesn't have the sort of clout it used to. Certainly not enough for people to calmly move out of the path of traffic like you're suggesting.
---
For PvP try to learn your class' role.
---
IE: if I remember correctly, Mesmers rotate through capture points, recapping and capping and being a +1 on 1v1 fights.
---
So we're supposed to not talk about the endgame here?  Seems odd for an MMO subreddit.
---
Honestly Hydaelyn could use a touch of the Commander too. The WoL is a little too forgiving. 
---
Ascalon would be fine.
---
Honestly this sub isn’t large enough to warrant this kind of reaction. Keep the community together and share what you enjoy.
---
Istan was the most fun way to make money for me. I don't enjoy Silverwastes.
---
I guess I'll have to find something else...
---
While I can agree that the raid community has taken a down turn and didn't recover with wing 6.
---
I didn't even know DnT was still a thing after that whole meme fiesta with bragging about world first and getting kicked off the tester guilds.
---
The UB tool can gather 3 nodes simultaneously but no other gathering tool can? And only the ones in the guild hall?
---
Well hey, at least we have the Dark Knight quests!
---
Where and for what reason? Is the time investment worth it for me as a player with limited entertainment time? Will I enjoy the process and/or the result?
---
I see what you're saying , but don't really see your point.
---
Tbh they are the most amusing guild. And while being "the best" is a controversial and, in any case, fleeting thing that barely concerns anyone, memes are eternal.
---
#worldfirst
---
Ajax Blue’s legacy shall never be forgotten.
---
It's simple, gems -&gt; gold. You know you want to.
---
A man of culture, I see.
---
Exactly. This is why AB multiloot got farmed only right before PoF release. Now the history repeats itself. istan was alive long enough to keep player count on acceptable levels, now it's time to promote newer content.
---
I guess nerfing a "worthwhile" meta is Anet's thing now. I wish they know how to improve meta rewards if they can't find players doing it. Nerfing something doesn't always solve the problem, sometimes it adds fuel to the fire. 
---
RIP AB
---
RIP Istan
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
And they will become a bigger asset to the team beacuse...?
---
worlds first gotta be worlds first
---
New engine in general. You can see where that leads if you look at Bethesda.
---
That would be awesome :D
---
Greatest guild in the history of the game LULW
---
Charr has wares if you have coin.
---
I only cared about the VM rewards. I hope they don't nerf that since it's account bound.
---
This guy gets it. I’m happy with the change, hopefully more to follow! 
---
What happened to the older fractals? Gw2 is not like wow where old content becomes obsolete, the existing fractals are as relevant as the new ones, and pretty much nobody consistently plays any fractals outside the rotation, so the date of release is even more irrelevant.
---
The problem has never been the lack of content, especially when the group of people you are referring to were farming the same dungeons for four years before fractals and HoT. People just like to use that argument, but in reality no online game can ever manage to produce enough new content to satisfy the rate at which a more dedicated player consumes it.
---
The issue here is gw2's reward structure. The lack of gear treadmill removes the Skinner's box that singlehandedly keeps a ton of other games alive. Even if you have lucrative gold farms, amassing gold in gw2 can only be translated to fashion or some minor convenience through the endless contracts, while players of other games can spend hundreds of hours to get that BiS gear for a 1% dps without complain. And all the development have to do to produce new content is put some new chase items in the game that take a handful of hours to develop.
---
So sad you can't spend 10 hours a day pressing 1 getting mountains of gold.
---
Tome F2 is nothing but burst healing. Brings the Signet share, perma Quickness and more. I agree it doesn't have more unique boons but it does the rest better than the other support
---
The mills of the gods grind slowly.
---
tbf most people wouldn't do more than one istan cycle per day anyway, and for that one cycle the rewards actually get a buff. the remaining people will likely spread over tarir and silverwastes, ya know, those other two infinitely repeatable and decently lucrative metas 🤷‍♀️
---
Okay, first the bullshit fractal changes (instabilities) and now this random nerfs to one of the last lucrative farms. Guess I will not be coming back soon, gj Anet!
---
There is about to be a big change regarding these posts on the sub. 
---
Stay tuned as it will be announced today. Actually would of been announced earlier but slept too late after a bit too much, shall we say, partying after the AFC championship yesterday. 
---
You're totally the kid in school who said "You guys HAVE to be nice to me, it's my birthday!"
---
This is some of the most hyperbolic bullshit I've read today, and I sort /r/politics by controversial.
---
[Here’s](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/home/leaving?target=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fdocument%2Fd%2F1lb1p7SMYTF8AkBPB1E_iTV2hKergpQKgECKOeCjWkC0%2Fedit%3Fusp%3Dsharing) my PvP guide, this should get you started!
---
Another time taking away from the playerbase and giving nothing in return. Meanwhile rewards for PoF metas is so garbage it's laughable. 
---
Somebody from the top floor decided players were making gold way to fast and easy, ignoring possible gem sales, so they decided to do some nerfs like this one (and fractal instabilities rework update which was mode to put off as many people possible from the mode).
---
It may be a legendary, yes, but it's only one of its kind in that no other accessories have skins or visual effects. If they let you transmute it to other accessories...then what? Create a whole new skin system for an equipment type that currently has no skins?
---
Aurora is cheaper than your average legendary anyway. And do you really want the same aura effect on all your characters?
---
&gt;only for a very short time. 
---
How often have you played the story of season 3 LW? Or how often have you repeated any story chapter of season 4 Lw?
---
3 times? 8 times?
---
i'll bet good money that raids and fractals have been repeated more often and also on a higher frequence than any LW episode has.
---
Yes more ppl do the story instances than raids but its just a fact that after the story is completed nobody does it anymore. But raids (even the oldest raids) are repeated every week by a lot of players
---
As PvX player it's right about fine with me. Just wish for a nice lfg tool that forms the grps for you so you don't have to ping those annoying kp even though you understood the raid after 2nd clear.
---
The sad part is, we've made some good friends (that have also felt deceived after yesterday), and in a lot of other ways, the guild has been pretty great. Members are friendly and outgoing, we share resources fairly freely and respectfully. It's just a very sour realization that these past couple weeks of spending every free moment we had between work, school, and other obligations to try to fully kit out our characters felt kind of pointless if running raids isn't going to happen, with this guild at least.
---
Of course, we still have fully-kitted characters and that alone is awesome, but the whole reason for doing so was shot down. So it's a mixed-bag. Maybe with the next balance patch, suddenly my build becomes pinnacle meta, woot!...but probably not, and I won't hold my breath to be "allowed" to raid.
---
I can understand that total anarchy in builds would be abysmally rough to handle, but this "build with these exact weapons, these exact runes, these exact attribute combos in exactly this order *or else we kick you*" is just not healthy in the long term for *any* scene, let alone a rather niche one to begin with. These "meta" builds should be used as guidelines, not rigid rulesets. But what do I know, I don't raid.
---
...that is hilarious. Goddamn that map breaks all records.
---
"Giving nothing in return."
---
Anet: "Players playing through each meta once will see an increase to their rewards."
---
This is a buff to your average player.
---
GW2 reddit coming in strong with venezualian economy plan.
---
None. Gradually introducing gear stats is essentially the GW2 version of gear progression.  
---
Each time another competitive stat combo comes around you've got people reworking their entire gear set for even the slighting gains. It doesn't add any meaningful build variety, instead all it does it make gearing less approachable, more expensive, and require more inventory space.  
---
After 1 lucrative run of istan a day? Sure.
---
Who is left on the table? SC? LN? If those 2 fall down we are left with truly casual game. \*Clap for one endgame update every 9 months\*
---
Next content update = next ls episode?
---
It probably works better in different meta groups. Chrono + Druid can be replaced with Diviner Renegade + Quickbrand if a power SB is there to provide Ice Spirit. I dunno how the group dps would compare, of course.
---
&gt; Our goal is for content like the Istan Metas to be a part of your daily play-cycle, without it becoming your entire play-cycle. In the next content build, we will be making some adjustments to the chests associated with the Palawadan and Mordant Crescent Great Hall metas in the Domain of Istan. An account daily limit will be applied to these chests, allowing for the opening of a maximum of 30 chests in Palawadan and 12 chests in the Great Hall per day per account. The base gear rewards have been increased, as well, so players playing through each meta once will see an increase to their rewards, but repeated runs will be less lucrative.
---
Note: This is being posted in English now, and we’ll follow with French, German, and Spanish as soon as we have this message localized.
---
happens to me a few times, damn right annoying and no reason why its taken so long to fix that....
---
glad I got my 100 spikes done ages ago lol
---
whoosh
---
And the people that only have time for one or two metas get better rewards too.
---
You may like it or not, but the truth is, this is a healthy change for the game.
---
Each ancient magics is strictly specific to the episode it was introduced under
---
**TL;DR**
---
If you do Istan's metas once per day, it's a **BUFF**. The best farm in the game is going to get EVEN MORE lucrative to you.
---
If you do istan's metas several times per day, it's a **NERF**. You'll have to swap to other different meta if you want to keep farming.
---
Istan was really awful due to the shitty fps you had there.
---
Like I don't understand why the PoF metas don't drop Amalgamated gemstones since they're needed for a Gift of Desert Mastery anyway.
---
Can you give me details on traits?
---
I don't know if maybe your a non-native english speaker, but from the way its phrased, its pretty clearly a joke.  The addition of the phrase, 'without a doubt' and 'in the history of the game' makes it pretty clear.
---
What I find funny is all the people in this chat claiming raiders are a minority in every game and anet shouldnt waste resources on raids. I guess this is true, but at the same time its only raid streams on twitch which has more than couple hundred viewers. No one cares watching open world gameplay. For marketing, raids ist important i think. If someone wants to start this game and sees there is no twitch stream at all, he will assume that this game has not a big player base. Other MMO's have way higher twitch numbers than gw2, thus its not hard to assume those game have a bigger player base. 
---
I liked it, I saved it, I'm gonna annoy my guild with it. I stand in solidarity with OP and will take half his minutes!
---
Things might be different if you play on NA but I play on EU and if you actually perform well with your off meta build then pugs will not care. If you and others are using arcdps then the dps of your build should speak for itself.
---
This example may not mean much to you but just yesterday I joined a pug kc group and I saw a power herald doing less dps than the bs and even then no one said anything.
---
Of course, the pug groups I usually join ask for anywhere between 200-250 li and MAYBE things are different in groups below 50 li.
---
If you're okay with it, would you or your bf be willing to share the builds you wanted to raid with?
---
Finally, fuck that guild that lied to you.
---
They both have a very different playstyle.
---
Thief uses Initiative as their class mechanic and their cool downs come from managing that. They are very much a glass cannon that can kill most targets quickly due to high burst and DPS but are tied with Elementalists and Guardians with the lowest HP.
---
Necromancers are a much tankier class with regular cooldowns that generally wear opponents down over time. Their class mechanic is the Death Shroud which gives another HP bar and a different set of skills. They also have a lot of skill related to applying/removing/transferring conditions which makes them very popular in WvW.
---
Personally when I just want to play somewhat mindlessly I'll go with a power Reaper (Necro elite spec) as you can cut through just about everything in open world without needing to worry about being overwhelmed.
---
Every charr in non cultural armor ever.
---
How do I find what server they're on? I cant find them anywhere.
---
Here's hoping they write that down in large letters somewhere in front of the people in charge of setting future content rewards and maintaining old ones.
---
They keep getting to the the sweetspot of rewards in one release, then the following ones are underwhelming. Then they occasionally produce one that it way too rewarding, and even the sweetspot spot gets depleted in comparison.
---
They have to both cap overwhelmingly large rewards and buff underwhelming rewards, so people don't go to just one spot over and over and instead go to several spots daily. 
---
Sounds good to me. 
---
You would not happen to be listed on https://gw2armory.com would ya?
---
I haven't logged onto GW1 in a long time! So this is more of an interpretation of how I saw it in my mind! then I added the prince rurik-type character with the classic fiery dragon sword
---
thank you! :)
---
The only exception isn't a mastery: the ability to gather unbound magic, which can be learned by buying the unbound magic gathering tools.
---
Both are strong classes. Check [this page](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guide:What_Profession_Should_I_Play) out.
---
My opinion:
---
Necro has power damage, condition damage, and support build options. It sacrifices some single-target DPS for tons of cleave and survivability. Necro mitigates damage by rerouting incoming damage to death shroud or barrier, and by using minions to draw aggro. 
---
Thief has power and condi damage builds. Shadowsteps make thief extremely mobile, and thief weapon skills have no cooldown (they use initiative instead), so combat is typically fast-paced. Thief mitigates damage using dodges, evade skills, and blinds.
---
I prefer the high-risk/high-reward gameplay of thief, knowing that if I miss a dodge or blind, I'll probably die.
---
Will this affect  Palawan Phylacteracies? Or do they mean supply cashes in both places?
---
I would still love for reward tuning across many of the open world maps and meta events. I don't want rewards to be upped to SW/AB multi-loot/Istan levels, but rather make it so that if I feel like going to a random map, it feels decently rewarding. PoF in particular could use some love.
---
I know ArenaNet made some statement about how it wouldn't be worth it or some other nonsense, which I heavily disagree with.
---
&gt;*implying that GW2 has been hardcore at any point*
---
lol
---
Dude, trust him.
---
you're right! mostly GW1 inspired. I like blending the past atmosphere from GW1 
---
Git Good
---
What's wrong with the latter?
---
It's not really the same, they are gated behind a key which you need to buy with currency you earned, as well as a shovel (I know most people don't need them). Players should be able to uncover as many as they want otherwise a tonne of people with a bunch of currency from Silverwastes won't be able to get rid of it.
---
GW2 also needs some kind of farm map. Silverwastes is fantastic as a way to play the game with a decent diversity of gameplay (defend forts, kill breach bosses, defend lanes, kill vinewrath, loot maze, chest train - no map has come close to the diversity of gameplay Silverwastes offers open world players).
---
That's a good point. Mostly I was thinking about the screenshots of scores and of saying hey I completed this raid/fractal. It's not something that happens often but felt it was worth including.
---
Personally I think that speed clears, tactics, builds videos would be just fine for the rest of the week as those are helpful to the community and the sub to promote further discussion. 
---
I'll edit the rules to make it clear that I mean score screenshots and similar and not actual quality content.
---
Please?
---
Made me feel like the sub was more alive. Not that its dead without it, but having all my Gw2 related content under the gw2 subreddit felt natural. Maybe the whole weekend would be a good idea too? Might help some people in weird/differant timezones?
---
But other living story maps don't really have any useful meta that are not "screw you player, here's your two yellows, blues and greens for an hour of coordinated stuff", are there? Newest map is hard-locked to two metas per day and single stupid-puzzle-room chest per day (otherwise people won't spend 2 months of daily run to get shiny weapons)
---
Annnnnnd rune of the berserker 6 bonus is STILL adding to the condi damage stat rather than increasing the damage dealt by condis by 5%.
---
Sigil of bursting does the same.
---
Percent conversions (maintenance oil and such) are still incorrectly applying after stats from signets, rather than before.
---
The tool is useful for quick sharing of builds and looking at some base stats, but if you're interested in the numbers, you're better off making your own tool or spreadsheet.
---
I don't think THEY ever called it the end game. YOU might. But it's just a form of content like any other. No more important.
---
If the art, character screenshots, etc., annoyed people so much they would get downvoted. The community already dictates what does or doesn't make it to the front page with up/downvotes. The majority upvote it, therefore the majority of the community likes it. There is a vocal minority that will always complain about it.
---
It'll probably be a burst of a few metas after reset and then mostly dead or, like, 1 map in LFG every few hours (good luck playing taxi wars).  
---
What I think partly caused their demise was their hardcore ability tbh as well as their egotistical behavior (the great salt fiasco). They burned themselves out in an extremely casual game and couldn't adapt. Raids will go on because they are open to the casual playerbase willing to learn and new blood will always come pouring in. That is the demographic Anet should be aiming for, though they will be missed. The raiding community has always been on the decline since the very start when no one was interested at all and there was no incentive to spend countless hours grinding a wing. Mutliple guilds liked to compete for the mantle of best, and that competitive spirit did make things fun for a while. But after more than a few years of raids, it hardly means anything anymore.  Most ppl get their kills then log off for the week. 
---
Scooping up all the hardcore players demanding hardcore requirements and standards while denying themselves access to the casual playerbase in an already small and isolated community really did them in. In my 3 years of raiding, I can name at most 3 or 4 DnT players I bumped into pugging. I'm guessing the rest generally look down on the rest of the raiding community. If you are going to declare yourself the best guild out there, at least contribute by literally helping other players instead of making youtube vids and puffing up your chest. Oh and stop making smarmy posts would help too. 
---
The idea for Sunday was that it usually is the deadest day and Saturday sometimes can still have important posts leftover from Friday. 
---
But yes the timezone issue does make it very complicated to pick a 24 hour period and already have another calling for the full weekend so that may be something we'll consider. 
---
I never saw them say that though. Saying  you CAN ( which I also never saw ) isn't saying you're GOING TO
---
With GW2 not as huge/active as a few other MMOs, or at least not on Reddit, Id prefer it all in once place, mainly for the sake of exposure and popularity. I already have GW2 Economy in addition to this sub.
---
this instance took me 4 tries due to the same problem. After I crashed for the 3rd time I waited 10 minutes, went to mistlock sanctuary and then back again, and it worked on my 4th try.
---
From your own link, emphasis mine:
---
&gt; They left in solidarity because of the "Patreon purge" where Patreon bumped Lauren Southern, Milo Yianappolous, and Carl Benjamin (Sargon of Akaad).
---
&gt; Lauren is a Rebel Media journalist who, after being very sympathetic with a group called Defend Europe, decided to embark on a mission with them out to sea, on the claim that she was just documenting their actions. This is a group that prevents potential illegal imigrants from reaching shore and many have drowned because of it. **Patreon booted her for being involved in a group that has caused loss of life.**
---
&gt; Milo, a former British Breitbart editor, was banned for his involvement with the proud boys and richard spencer after they caught wind of a video of Milo singing the American national anthem in a karaoke bar with Spencer and their friends doing the Nazi salute. **Patreon doesn't allow hate groups.**
---
&gt; Sargon is an anti-feminist YouTuber who was banned after a stream where he called people in the chat "White Ni**ers" and later said that "White people dont act like this." He claimed it didn't count as racism because he was saying it to white nationalists. **Patreon doesn't allow hate speech.**
---
&gt; **Patreon gave each of these people chances to fix their standing with them and all refused.** They state otherwise, but you can find the back and forth emails in most articles about this. **Card companies have also been making it difficult for patreon, as they do not want to be associated with hate groups and such.**
---
Sounds like Patreon *had* a problem.  They got rid of some of it, and more of it went with it.
---
CF is on SBI and KnT is on Kaineng 
---
Well , targets change in a development environment. Maybe at one time they were hoping to do that , but then saw it just wasn't a good use of resources , because raids aren't that important. "We are hoping to" or "We would like to aim to" isn't "We are GOING TO"
---
While entertaining to watch, they would fit better to majority of the playerbase skill-wise.
---
I approve :D

People get bored after a while from playing old content. Hardcoreplayers are willing to farm/repeat content a lot, that's why they usually need less new content as casual- and coregamers. Usually that's not a problem because casual/coregamers also spend less time ingame and consume content much slower.
---
GW2 has (since release) serious problems with teamcontent. Shortly after release many more casual players either completly left GW2 because GW2 was a singleplayer game for them - or they went into dungeons (which were meant as challenging content) and complained about difficulty. This was a few weeks after release already. Over the years these complaints stayed. Guilds complain about a lack of content they can play together with guildmates (many guilds do dungeons+fractals, instanced teamcontent is guildcontent too).
---
Has nothing to do with gear. Even people which still haven't ascended equip complain about a lack of content. I know people which left GW2 before reaching level 80 because there is no content. GW2 is a full blown single player game. It was never intended to have a guild and play with other teammembers. Open world only. But if you want to play together with your schoolmates, wive, brother, friends, whatever: GW2 is not intended for you. Otherwise there would be more "co-op content".
---
If you look at GW1 the difference is pretty obvious. GW1 delivered nightfall half a year (!) after factions got released. Nightfall has like 20+ storymissions which are comparable to dungeon story mode. There is a hardmode which doubles the content. There are hundreds of quests, there is a raid with 5 maps. Event content as wintersday and halloween doubled with nightfall, too. So obviously delivering content on a much faster rate than GW2 does is possible. That's a matter of tools, of design decisions and so on. 
---
As example: my guild is out of content for years now. We play once a week for maybe 2 hours. So very casual. When even we are out of content any more dedicated guild which is not into "farming content" is out of content long ago. We paused the game for months, too. Like 6 months last year. One new fractal, play it a few times: nothing to do left. We already did all old fractals and all dungeons. Nothing else to do in GW2, no other teamcontent. Dungeons are 2012 content, we can also play GW1 and get content which is "as new" as GW2s content.
---
If there would be maybe 10 dungeons each year: with 5 repetitions that would keep us busy. Not only us. Others would do these dungeons, too. Even hardcoreplayers would be kept busy. Even raid players do enjoy fractals/dungeons. So these casuals- and coregamers would spend more time ingame, would improve a bit, would run into raid players, might become part of raiding. Similar as some "semi-speedrun" dungeon guilds ran into new members in dungeons. Casual- and coregamers are usually not interested in farming fractals daily. So quantity matters. One fractal: 15 min of content. Keeps you busy a week. Or maybe five weeks. But not 53 weeks.
---
As said: that's a matter of tools. In some games even pupils can glue something like this together in a few hours:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t95LymoisQA Or see WC3. Not all content needs to be mouthpainted by 99 virgins. And a lot of existing content could've easily been recycled as teamcotent (see lake dorics caudecus mansion story part. Add a "teammodus" and new rewards, balance stats of enemies on 5 players and that's it, a new dungeon got created).
---
Coming from other MMO's I kinda have to agree.
---
GW2's raiding is very... well basic is not the word for it but it kinda fits.
---
WoW is a game entirely built upon raiding. It’s a *significant* portion of the end game content available to the game. And would you look at that, it’s the most popular MMO by far and always has been. 
---
You can still do an hour of Istan before heading to SW.
---
If you get downvoted do you get banned instead?
---
They're also needed for completing the Funerary collection.  I had a bunch from HoT metas when I did that but was baffled to find a PoF collection requiring items that aren't available in PoF to complete.
---
Ehh.. yes, you can use Aurora account wide...
---
The thing is, Anet has a long LONG track record of over delivering and under performing.  Here are the examples I can remember off the top of my head:
---
-hot legendary weapons with legendary journeys, scrapped to just be a set of skins  (skin set still not done)
---
-ad infinitum released 6 (ish?) months late
---
-legendary armor released late (like a year or so late?), and while show casing the armor they may have used a modified graphics engine (no way to prove this, but if you review the video evidence I believe it is true).  
---
-fractal leaderboards, promised 3 times (including as a selling point hot feature lol), never released.  
---
-when the new format for fractals was announced pre-hot, they came into the forums and told us that swap of the mists meta wouldn't happen because they were going to balance individual fractal rewards, to this day no such effort has happened, instead they implemented the current daily system.  
---
-told us elite specs wouldn't power creep the game
---
-promised no gear treadmill, but then they made it so you could only get more optimal gear sets with expansions (not to mention, ascended was never even suppose to be in the game)
---
I think that for players who have been here for a long time, its pretty clear that for Anet, over promising (sometimes called lying) is standard operating procedure.  
---
I think I know where this is going, and I really don't like the thing where this is going, man.
---
As any other legy, also Aurora can be used account wide.
---
As an artist, I highly disagree with art being posted on sundays. It will be a competition to post their work then and it will truly be disheartening to post. If this ends up being the case, nobody will want to post oc here. I know I wouldn't. Mods, please reconsider the art decision. Theres too much art being posted to be reserved for such a day when others are going to try to get views with their screens, fashion and such.
---
Nothing is ban worthy I feel. I like you post personally! I commend you for your skills!
---
Too many (unchanged)ascended armor skins, I'm talking about the original skin when you craft one or get a drop. That makes it non endgame material to me, you gotta mix n match, not necessarily something to blind another person, but you cant have that many basic ascended skins, it just makes it meh.
---
NO. I am entitled to play exactly as I choose no matter what you opinion of it is. I am entitled to join any group and make them carry my bear bow butt through any encounter
---
^ehm, ^yes ^\s
---
I can't stand the anti-social consequence of changes like this. Communities formed around farms like Istan and daily lock outs will disrupt them. One of the good things about Istan farm is that it was always on - so like WvW, a place you can always log into and find a community of people you know, Istan provided an open world place where you could always find a group of familiar people. A daily lock out is going to greatly disrupt and reduce this.
---
Often I'll log in and a friend might have already done AB/TD metas and so we won't play together to do those things, but we can always do Istan together. Now if someone has already done the daily, they won't want to do Istan again. 
---
One of the biggest disruptions to my social circle that I played GW2 with was the fractal lockouts. Different people would do the dailies already and later in the day wouldn't want to do them when someone else logged in. People would wait to do them with different people at different times and it was very common for someone to be left out, not because people were unwilling to run more fractals, but because they were unwilling to run fractals a second time for less rewards. For all the benefits of a daily rewards system as opposed to a repeatable grind, they cause a lot of social disruption in what is supposed to be a social game.
---
It is. And the people trying to claim that the game is "hardcore" are very delusional. From the outset it was designed to be the hop-in, hop-out casual game, then they decided to give the people desperate to call themselves hardcore ascended gear and blinding auras, and then took a stab at raids. The raids themselves are beautifully designed visually and with their own unique stories, but they have the same level of mechanics and difficulty that other MMOs had 10 years ago. I'm glad they implemented raids but the game was never designed from the philosophy to the mechanics to include them, and they will never be the main focus.
---
Think that would only be fair.
---
The NA LFG is like the Sahara Desert. 
---
Do you enjoy playing with no challenge at all, just pressing 1 through content which plays itself? As a person with limited play time myself, I gave up on map meta and story episodes in this game, and instead only do my weekly raids with my static, spending whatever free time I have during the week trying out new things on golem. Days are too short to sit through setpieces which offer no challenge whatsoever.
---
It's much better than all those "ooo I got my first rare item today, so happy! Game is great, you are all amazing!" Posts out there. 
---
The community in general does need to get better in the game.
---
Best place to ask: reddit. Good luck.
---
&gt; If content it coming out , it literally is not in maintenance mode
---
I said:
---
&gt;  We're entering maintenance mode.
---
&gt; **entering**
---
We're not there yet, but soon enough. Living story type of content and balance patches kept getting added to GW1 for years after active development was dropped in favor of GW2, so getting new content doesn't mean the game is actively in development.
---
very bad idea. as long its about guild wars 2 .. even if someone just posts his "low effort" "i got 100% world completion" is something that belongs to this sub! this is what makes this community up! and not some ... na na na only on saturday na na na ...
---
Yeah, I mean, people can always filter or downvote if they don't like something. 
---
Taking away people ability to post about the game on the game reddit makes no sense. Not everyone in the game population even know about the subreddits or wants to use them.
---
I don't know exactly how much raid experience you have but if you know the boss fights then I don't see why there should be an issue.
---
As for your build it doesn't sound too bad at all. You could definitely outdps your average pugs on most bosses if you know what you're doing.
---
&gt; You assume I think...
---
Uh, no I don't?  That's you making an assumption of what *I* think, not the other way around.  You did it twice.
---
Moving on away from the red herring, nice try though.  Seriously, how much fallacious logic are you going to throw at this?
---
When you agree to a ToS, you are no longer guaranteed 'free speech'.  What 
---
happened to these Professional Victims is no different than the 12 year old kid who keeps changing his username to various offensive names getting banned from Xbox Live.
---
Free Speech is only guaranteed in the US by the government.  Literally no one else has to put up with what you have to say, and literally no one else is required to give you a platform to say it.
---
And that's just fine.

It's not low effort. He/she even cut-out the fingers. It's way more than a lot of people around here do.

I agree. There's a big difference between posturing yourself above a community and actually integrating and increasing the value of a community by helping it grow.
---
That is a really good point and I agree. Or make it tradeable as with the amalgamated gemstone.

I only judge from what has been shown, if my bias is my opinion based on his public statements and callouts, then ok. Sorry he's not humble

Like I said. I hate overly political people. Cheers :)
---
Finally. That stupid amount of random screenshots  and questionable art posts fishing for compliments every second was a huge problem to begin with. Maybe it would even be a solution to create a new sub for art / fluff etc. like there is for jokes.
---
I'd argue that the art and fashion wars subreddit are so dead that its literally not worth posting there.

Although this might seem like a low effort post, I can see that the author put more thought and time on this than most of the community have put to be better at the game.

Yeah a bummer. Just watched a video that got me psyched about flipping and sorry is gone right when I want to stay: (

Good. My only complaint is that it took this long. I don't blame people for taking advantage, I do myself time to time. But deep down we all knew that from the moment it singlehandedly crashed material prices it was too good to stay. 
---
There are still going to be ways to farm. It's now probably going to look like Palawadan --&gt; Great Hall --&gt; Silverwastes until Octovine. Which is a solid 3 hour of play. But I consider this an improvement.
---
ANet: "This is an intervention"
---
Yeah that was me telling political asshats who were shitting on those MAGA teens to grow the hell up. Lmao I'm pretty consistent with this shit. 
---
This was rather interesting
---
&gt;And there is another problem. Someone, or some bot, downvotes almost every post as soon as it goes up. A lot of time posts that could be legitimate discussion never get about 5-10 upvotes yet a picture taken with a phone about world completion gets 1500. That post realistically should of been removed as a low effort post, because it was. But we choose to leave it up even with tons of reports because the community upvoted it.
---
Based on [This comment](http://reddit.com/r/gw2economy/comments/aiacy6/gw2spidy_is_down/eemf13u) on /r/gw2economy it seems that its being closed down, but since the site itself is down we can't verify it.
---
If Ruben is closing the site I am going to see if the database at least can be preserved in full as this is the oldest archive of tp prices going right back to 2012
---
It is, but it's less lucrative per Time spent than TD or AB. 
---
What I'd like to see happen is start with both Istan metas, loop RIBA until Octovine Pre, do Octovine, loop RIBA until Gerant, do Gerant.
---
Dude what the fuck

Same :c when I'm sad, I look at the 43.8k benchmark from Fennec and see the 60k first 20% on the golem and get more sad

That...sounds like your personal opinion is that these posts aren't worthwhile, and that you disagree with the community for upvoting them. It also sounds like you are trying to cater more to the tastes of a select few against the tastes of the community at large. I hope I'm wrong about that.
---
I had no idea the female model of the chest looked so cool wow
---
It's so beautiful!! 
---
If you (intend to) play WvW, you may also consider saving the XP boosters for that one. PvE experience for masteries is usually gained very quickly.
---
Pets do when you’re specced as a soulbeast elite POF specialisation and in beast mode.
---
Core ranger your best bet is GS3 for a gap closer.
---
You can get cheap’ish ascended trinkets, accessories and rings from fractals. I’d start there, while working through the expansions and unlocking the elite specs. 
---
Good luck. Ranger and it’s elite specs - Druid and soul beast are great and versatile across all endgame content.
---
Except for no, it doesn't. Some people genuinely have that big of an ego.

When one project is done.. there's always another :D

It doesn't have to be full weekend, it can be from earliest worldwide Sunday 00:00 to latest worldwide Sunday 23:59.
---
Your theory falls flat because AB multiloot was nerfed long long before PoF release, I started the game when Lake Doric was released and even then there was no multiloot.
---
If you want to come up with some conspiracy theory, at least use semi-facts.
---
Actually even if you are planning to make one I would suggest going with HoT if possible. Less hassles to make Gift of Maguuma than Gift of the Desert
---
That's like saying a teacher walking into a class and saying "be smarter" is good teaching. Even if those kids need to be smarter, that would involve educating them not making a shitpost.
---
That said yeah, hardly ban worthy.
---
Hmm, but to be able to choose for a ban or not (upvote or not), I would need to see the actual post, to know why the user should be banned. 
---
I mean it's a bit like a joke to demand "ban votes", but censor the reason of the ban. It's actually an absolute blind vote, because we don't know nothing.
---
And that's why I don't give an upvote. Maybe it is a ban worthy post and maybe this user deserves the ban, but maybe not.
---
I won't give anyone extra ban time, without knowing the ban reason nor having any information about the circumstances. 
---
Haha yeah I make the new ones as soon as they release, and fuuuuck doing desert mastery unless I absolutely have to. 
---
Metas should be hard though. 
---
I think they are too easy, and this is a symptom of anet trying to appease a the lowest common denominator who "just want to see the story", who usually just quit the game afterwards anyway.
---
By allowing these awful players to clear the storyline in their Rabid Carrion Soldier hybrid gear with Sapphire Orbs and no trinkets, they essentially open up later maps to these awful players and have to accommodate them or face complaints that the game is too hard. In the case of meta events, the scaling means more skilled players have to carry their lack of DPS or support. We've witnessed the consequence of this first hand where at the launch of HoT defeating the Chak Gerent was a huge, exciting event for the most skilled players to gather, but no one in pug maps could do it because bads kept scaling up the event. So they made it easier and now Chak Gerent isn't exciting anymore. The problem was that they allowed braindead players to even reach Tangled Depths in the first place, who just scale up the events in their bearbow PVT gear they literally gave away to all new players.
---
To be very clear, I'm not blaming the playerbase for sucking. I'm blaming ANET for not forcing their players to get good. I'm a Gw1 vet who thinks if you die in a story mission you should restart it from the beginning.
---
Serpent' Ire suffers from the opposite problem where the devs seem to have forgotten to account for the bads and now the breakbars on Phase 2 are super tough and their health overscales if each player doesn't have competent DPS.
---
THAT SAID,  there are also issues with how Serpent's Ire introduces its mechanics. In every other meta which requires a split, there is an extremely clear icon on the map and usually an NPC escorting players. 
---
Even if you are a decent player, it is extremely hard to adapt to Serpent's Ire if doing it for the first time because it is telegraphed so poorly through gameplay.
---
Not only that, but the problem with Serpent's Ire is also the difficulty curve. Everything is compounded into the second phase of the event, when the second phase should be a tutorial and the third phase be the boss which tests player mechanics of everything leading up to it.
---
We can't fix the bads joining Vabbi with their "I defeated Balthazar! hurrhurrhurr" PVT gear,  but we could at least try to fix it mechanically so as to still require challenge.
---
My proposal for Serpent's Ire is to massively reduce the Breakbar scaling on the Zealots, but to change the final boss where Zealots continuously spawn around the arena who summon the Branded Orbs from the 25% phase who power up the boss. So you have a situation where the boss slowly gets stronger over time as the Zealots spawn and you need a dedicated team to run around and CC the zealots to slow down the rate the boss powers up. By the time the boss is on low HP, he should be really strong and there should be a really intense adrenaline rush as he downs players left and right with 1shots and 2shots. Then, when he reaches 1%, he should have one final orb phase where he tries to use his ultimate attack one last time to down everyone at once, and you need to run around destroying the Zealots again to stop orb production. He unleashes his attack, you survive, and the battle is won! A barrier is established over the mirror of lyss, and chests spawn all over the Brand like in Dragon's Stand, which you have to surf around and find. That is how I'd change the fight.
---
Okay then, I guess there's nothing else for it.  We'll have to agree to disagree and get on with our respective (hopefully less bullshit-filled) Mondays?  Cheers, for real this time.
---
Don't post characters except sundays
---
Streamer viewer numbers aren't representative of much.  When one popular personality can bring viewer numbers that dwarf most established esports it brings into question what viewer numbers represent.
---
MMOs in general aren't good stream games.
---
would have. please, this hurts my eyes. ;_;
---
Is the Magic Find very critical in this aspect? Or not as much?
---
And did you just trade post right away or salvage the gears and then sell the mats? 
---
I like this idea!
---
As of this post, OP has a 15min ban for a terrible shitpost so yes.
---
I understand, your trying to argue that image proves that Nike's character is such, that the twitter statement clearly isn't a joke.  But to me, that just isn't a convincing case.  
---
Donated 5 $ atm, I can't donate more, but hope it helps =)
---
well we all had to learn raids without being taught by someone else initially. I do agree that GW2 doesn't have a good tutorial on foundations and basics in the game like breakbars and such since the breakbars we have now are different than the start of the game. Though even then the Defiant stacks didn't have a tutorial or anything in the game beyond reading the tooltip for it.
---
&gt; Telling people to 'Git Gud' as a meme or message is low effort, demeaning and isn't a message any game community should make strides to send to its player base.
---
that's why the git gud meme is so resonant with people. its reductive to the point of absurdity. that's where the humor comes from. It's not intended to be used seriously as its use in a serious context weakens the credibility it has as serious advice
---
Seems like even PvE is falling appart now. Gj Anet, keep it going.
---
Sorry man, I don't see enough evidence to buy that argument here.  
---
Holy crap... really? That’s a damn shame. 
---
Hence the reason it's a low effort post.
---
What the. Is exotic ranger gear really that much cheaper? Every time I fully gear a power glass with exotic it costs me nearly 100g
---
Just go to a meta event and ask ppl what they are running. Trust me, you don't wanna ask this again after you've seen that lul.
---
Yup 100% agree. Just thought it was worthwhile to mention the average and absolute lowest amounts along with the capped out one :)
---
Gaining 150 ferocity and up to 25% more crit damage tends to do that since your really do have a high crit chance normally even with spotter and banners.
---
Dont get me wrong, I'd love to read more discussion posts too, but it's almost like nobody posts them anyways. I wish that wasnt the case. Definitely be lenient  on art posts please, not because I want it for me, but for all artists who want to share art of characters, OC or NPC. 
---
I posted it above.
---
I really like mistlock as a central hub and fractal access but it really is going to be up to you. It's not going to add much that you don't already have.
---
I think there might be an out and out riot if that were to happen. **Maybe** if they buffed a ton of other map metas at the same time but I'm not even sure about that.
---
Fwiw I’m one of that demographic. Not enough time irl to git gud at a video game. I spend my time farming ascended gear sets so I can run meta builds that look fun, and then run out of time and energy to actually master the rotation and event mechanics. I go into T4 fractals and wing it, just relying on the fact that I’m a Scourge, Chrono or Quickbrand to carry me. I skip raids entirely, and spend more time watching /u/WoodenPotatoes Game of the Day vids than actually PvP’ing, and dip into WvW casually from time to time.
---
But this still made me lol. It’s just funny and I don’t take it seriously. If we can’t laugh at ourselves from time to time, what are we.
---
madlads
---
Happy to help, let me know if you have any other questions on it all!
---
Yeah, I was gonna say, this is like the third-or-something post today where the characters look exactly the same except for the dye schemes. 
---
This is the correct answer to this issue. If we wanted tons of extra rules, regulations, and censorship, we would just use the official forums, the voting system takes care of things people aren't interested in. I would think most people come here for the freedom vs the suppression on the official. 
---
Nerfing the loot on most people's favorite meta? This'll end well...
---
No. That would not help any content creators.
---
&gt; Perhaps a better solution would be to require more quality in the posts of character showcases? Requiring things like armor type, armor name, dye name, etc? It would make the posts more quality while still allowing these types of showcases throughout the year.
---
Funny enough that is almost how this idea started as one of my plans when I became a mod was to make that information be required for all character showoff and if it was not there the post would be removed. We realized that it would be very difficult to enforce 24/7  and the idea was tabled as we started brainstorming what eventually became this.
---
For the most part I agree with everything else. It's a difficult thing to do. We have a very vocal part of the sub that pretty much wants all of these posts gone and put in their own subs which do exist even if they are basically dead. Personally I don't want that. I want them here but I also agree that there are days where the sub is flooded with 'fluff' posts instead of actual discussion and what little posts about that there are get buried. 
---
Not disrespectful at all and good points all around. It is a very difficult situation and a lot of really good points are being brought up that we didn't think of.
---
At least he's got his burn guild 😀
---
Then you won't find pins. 
---
Even the sub rules state that posts could be removed, but only **repeated offenses** get you banned.
---
I'm not a huge Noxxy-fan and I understand why this is viewed as low-effort/shitposting, but it's definitely no repeated offense, and I'm sure that she actually puts a lot of effort into most of her posts.
---
But I hope the mod team enjoys their internet power trips!
---
Keep making assumptions. Goodbye.
---
CC specialist Dragonhunter for WvW that gels well into small group play well. You can drop hammer for sword/shield is you want a bit more chase potential. With sword 2(600) Judge intervention(1200, no line of sight required), and spear(1200, reveal) you should bear be able to keep up with any mesmer/thief that decides to run off. Utilities can be changed as needed.
---
Wrath of Justice can be dropped for Retribution if you want more damage.

I'll never understand how people can be so proud of their mundane mishmash with terribly unnatural looking dye schemes that pay no regard to the materials or textures of the armor. These posts need their own thread, their own subreddit, or the moderators just need to crack down on the low effort posts and ask people to put this stuff on GW2 style website instead.
---
Hoping for a blanket ban on story discussion/spoilers for a while right after a new chapter drops.

20 from hearts
---
~25 from mining nodes - you get 5 nodes revealed after meta success, you can map swap to other winning maps and mine more, but it's capped at 25 nodes per account per day, drop rate seems to be around 1 in 3 so every node should give you 1 on average
---
5-10 from dwarven chest/light of deldrimor revealed chests
---
So total you can get about 50 in 1.5 hours. 
---
It's a 3D render. The whole scene has been created in 3D.
---
I appreciate how responsive the moderation team is.
---
That being said, I disagree fundamentally with this decision. Obviously I'm a bit biased because I recently posted mine in a big collection, but I feel like making ANY attempt to stifle creativity in this subreddit is a gigantic mistake. 
---
* Pushing all of the content to a particular day only discourages new players from showing what they've come up with. We're not missing ANYTHING by letting customization posts do well on off-season news periods. It'd be completely fair to have stricter moderation during times where something important or interesting is happening, but during downtime, who is it hurting really?
---
* Lumping new player achievements/accomplishments in with this day is also a flawed idea. How are these posts any different from the millions of "I just started this game and it's amazing!" posts we get? But I don't even think those are bad. Why are we segregating new player experiences at all? We have a reputation as a welcoming community. The subreddit should reflect that.
---
* We already have several systems in place, being part of reddit, to discourage seeing content. Content Filters, tagging systems, and upvoting/downvoting are solutions to a problem of "I don't want to see this kind of content". I think moderation's efforts would be better suited making filters and tagging much more refined and easier to select. 
---
* Ultimately a majority of the alternative subreddits are so niche and lacking in viewership that nobody will ever use them, so any attempts to encourage players to use those subreddits during weekdays likely won't work.

Side question, can Aurora’s effects be disabled? I want to kit out in all possible legendaries, but don’t want to get too shiny. I just want the stat swapping, and haven’t started working on this due to the effect (plus having 2 PVP lege armors, The Ascension, a torch, and a pistol left to make).

Funny. I had thought DnT had already retired before PoF. Based on the other posts here it seems that DnT hasn’t had much relevance in years making the twitter post’s claims kind of an exaggeration in some aspects. 
---
Keep responding.
---
Uh, okay..cool? Hopefully Arenanet, you will be successful in making it so Istan isn't the go-to for every PoF farmer. HOWEVER, in doing so, the same buff needs to be made to the far less lucrative maps, Kourna, Sandswept, Serpents Ire (FOR THE LOVE OF GOD SERPENTS IRE). Buff the initial daily chest, it'll bring an influx of players to the map to help newer players, people doing achievements, and breath life into old content. 
---
If Istan is the only map facing these changes, then you've successfully missed another opportunity to rectify the mistakes of the past of making Istan 5x more lucrative as the other PoF maps. 
---
If you actually want a lore-consistent naming convention, you'll need to tell us your character's race. And further, if you actually care about any RP element to your character, it might be wise to have developed some sort of backstory or connection to existing aspects of the GW2 universe so that RPers can assist you.

I’ve attacked a duel before only to realize it was a duel when my teammate didn’t help. After I back off when I realized my mistake I get ganged up on and stomped and often my teammate is a jerk. 
---
I don’t respect any duels unless they are really out of the way. If I get there by normal roaming it’s not a good spot. Only exception I have is blue/green BL near the sentry close to south camp. If right outside SMC I’m going to jump in. 
---
I would build a power Chrono, good open world, story, meta, farm, decent PvP, pretty good fractal, viable in raids, zerker version is easy to gear while losing minimal DPS, not bad overall.

There's also the possibility of new features entirely, such as gliding or mount tech.

Holy shit, they *finally* did it. It only took months and for most items to become worthless. This is how most content in the game should be. Something you do in your daily rotation but not something you can farm hours on end. Now they just need to do something about SW.
---
Is your argument that, without high end raiding guilds, new players will have no way of figuring out that they shouldn't use Nomad's gear?
---
...because we have had high end raiding guilds for a while, and we still have players playing terrible builds with bad gear. And they often come **here** for help, and there are thousands of players who regularly frequent this forum who will be able to help them, even if raiding guilds never update their websites again.
---
Like, c'mon. There's a middle ground between "you can do literally anything you want" and "you need a PhD in Guild Wars studies in order to be able to craft a decent build." The rest of us will be fine. 
---
Demod /u/Godnaz ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
that's brilliant!
---
Don't blame anet. It's not on purpose and malicious. It's just incompetence.
---
they’re fucking stupid for doing this 
---
Let us use the Vlast Blaster on other PoF maps.
---
I guess it's up to interpretation.  One thing about your comment, I'm not sure this is a big announcement.  He posted it to twitter.  I don't use twitter, but my understanding is that you only see tweets from people you follow similar to seeing facebook posts?  If so, then he only announced it to his followers.  The reddit post is by RJD20, I dont know that they have any affiliation with DNT, but I also have no idea who RJD20 is.  
---
IMO, if a game's reward cycle is tied so heavily to doing a limited set of content for money for a long period of time per day, and all other alternative activities that should be of a similar effort are substantially worse...there's really an issue in the reward cycle design.
---
GW2TP.com has the same outputs as gw2spidy so it should be pretty easy to convert your sheets to utilize that site instead.
---
"If all you're doing is pressing print screen on the character screen or using your phone to take a picture, that is not high effort post."
---
Eh, I think you're wrong there.
---
Taking proper screenshots is an art - in and of itself - it's like photography and takes effort.
---
Properly combining or dyeing art pieces takes at least a basic understanding of colour theory. It takes effort.
---
If all it took was just pressing the screenshot button, it would not get upvoted, the screenshot has to consist of something that has value and shows effort, something people find worth upvoting.
---
Then you need balance which means a lot of tears from this sub. 
---
Would be cool if succeeding that meta disabled the brandstorm for a while. There are a lot of loot chests in the brand anyway, with some (i believe) unique rewards), but the whole place is just such a hassle to be in that it's more trouble than it's worth to get them.  
---
Succeeding Serpent's Ire should spawn a few more of those chests around the ruins where the final battle takes place and just shut down the brandstorm until the beginning of the next meta cycle (or even until the next failed meta, though you risk getting stuck in a failure cycle that way, where people won't do the meta because the storm is still in effect making it harder)
---
I am *highly* opposed to **art** being mashed together with **screenshots** of login screens, mystic forges and map completions. It's like equating a painting to a photograph, and a live music performance to pressing a button on your MP3 player.
---
Making art pieces takes around 100 times more time and effort than making screenshots of combinations of dev-pre-designed skins and places, or dev-pre-designed events. Art also has at least 10 times more value than any screenshot because of its uniqueness, even if it's relatively poor art.
---
Without art, this sub will be boring as hell - *uninspiring, homogeneous* - for many readers during the weekdays. And on Sundays, it will be a bloody mess of a fight between the people who spent days or weeks on imagining and creating their own painting, and the people who pressed a single button to screenshot a thing that was already designed and sold to them as pretty/impressive.
---
I've *played* this game and *seen* all the screenshots - so yes, they should be shoved into Show-Off Sundays. However, I *haven't* seen the artpieces - so I come to reddit to see them and discuss them, along with the relevant current events, background story and all those things which will keep me interested in the game even after seeing all of its 3D assets on my PC screen with my own eyes.
---
Yeah, I hear that. I take bad to not having FFXIV’s /gpose in GW2. Made making screenshots a breeze!
---
But you’ve done a really great job. The Zeno hawks Gates one is probably my favourite. 
---
Whelp, that guild sucks. My guild raids infrequently, and literally all that we ask of our DPS players is that they can hit ~12k (in the fight, not on the golem) however they want to do that. If they hit 15, 17, 20? Fantastic, bragging rights for you and everyone gets a better shot at finishing the raid faster. 
---
Raids aren't nearly hard enough to be quibbling about miniscule amounts of DPS. Screwing up a mechanic once does far more to kill your chances if you're not in a SC run.
---
1) Placement matches 
---
2) You get two more pips per game when you are in Plat, and four more when you are in Legendary. More info here: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/PvP_League
---
This is so disappointing to read. :(
---
Or a fucking "I finally finished world completion after 6 years of playing" or  
---
"My first ascended weapon after 20 years since release" with 2k upvotes... kormir preserve us
---
Huge if big.
---
I don't really understand why OP is posting this.  Is RJD20 in any way associated with DNT?  
---
&gt; I just think people who are as politically aggressive as you are crazy
---
And I think violent racists are crazy.
---
But you know who's crazier?  The people who rush to defend them armed with personal attacks, logical fallacies, and then when they finally realize they're not getting anywhere with them try to pretend they don't care in some feeble attempt to convince themselves that being a cunt is a Moral High Ground.
---
People like you.
---
&gt; You're all the same just different shades of shit.
---
Whatever you say, sunshine.  Let me know when you think your shit don't stink, and I'll be by to rub your nose in it again.
---
I see, thank you! Any reference for that, or is that just a generalisation?
---
We?
---
Not me. None of these bugs affected me.
---
yeah, yeah, and you run the meta successfully every event cycle, i'm sure
---
It Would take massive balls to buff reaper in pve and nerf in PvP. That would be too hard too. No way to do it. Just like how thief was trash-tier for long, buffs just simply can't be done without bold balls.
---
So true.
---
&gt; You are not wrong, but there are other subreddits for that content and they don't get used.
---
But there are also "other subreddits" for builds, raids, PvP and WvW. Why the special treatment for art?
---
It’s not just stats necessarily. It’s rotations as well. Look at any complicated rotation and ask yourself if casual players could come up with it. The answer is almost definitely no. Plus that compounds itself with the fact that if the gear isn’t optimal plus the rotation not being optimal you’re looking at probably 30%+ damage loss 
---
I think this is a terrible idea. You're now deciding what posts your users are allowed to see on a daily basis based on the complaints of a small but vocal group. Let Reddit's voting system do its job.
---
Of the 25 top posts in this sub from the last month, 13 would have qualified for deletion under this new rule. That doesn't indicate to me that the sub wants art/screens/comics/etc. effectively removed from daily rotation.
---
However, if you're dead-set on sequestering a huge chunk of your content into single days during the week, I'd like to know on what days you'll be deleting the following types of posts:
---
* Complaints about ArenaNet suspensions, bans, devs and/or forum moderation
---
* WvW roaming montages
---
* PSAs (often weeks later) about game updates/changes that were clearly outlined in the patch notes and discussed at length in the Path Notes threads
---
* "I'm a refugee from WoW/BDO, tell me everything about the game and rate how much I will like each feature"
---
* Posts asking when the next sale will be, or when X item will return to the gem store
---
Please rethink this course of action. These kinds of rules are sub-killers.
---
The major advantages of Mistlock is that you can port back to the map you where in before by double clicking the scroll again, and that it has a fractal gate and all the fractal vendors. 
---
It’s definitely the best hub out there, but if you don’t ever plan to do fractals, I would stick with what you have now. 
---
I understand what you meant, it looks like Artorias boss room.
---
Heretic!
---
:P
---
Not sure thats crazier than being a violent racist but you're the expert
---
or alternatively take a rifle with diviner stats and concentration sigil for similar results
---
pros: inventory space saved by not having an entire set dedicated to afk content, very cheap, low effort, you contribute damage too not just scaling up events and can actually kill trash mobs when alone
---
cons: you can't be 100% asleep(95% is fine), quickness uptime has to be compensated by elixir U or acceptance of the fact that it's ok to not have it perma in open world, you might get mocked by other farmers if you end up dealing more damage than juvenille fanged ibogas
---
You had one job.
---
Nothing they do in terms of rewards will make players touch serpents ire because they can't complete it by pressing random buttons on random builds.
---
Thanks for this. I saw the original post but not the mod response, makes a lot more sense now. 
---
Honestly, I would only farm DS if I want a unique skin, item, or currency. The return is not good. 
---
It's easy. here's how it works:
---
1. Work your typical 9-5 hours day by day and not a single minute longer.
---
2. Do bare minimum to feel incentive plan for the monthly bonus.
---
3. Not care about the company or the product you are told to take care of.
---
4. Receive cupcakes from ovehyped fans after releasing another gemstore skin.
---
&gt; Theres too much art being posted to be reserved for such a day
---
There was a time when I thought this game had very little fanart because of how *little* was posted on this sub. I then discovered there was quite a lot of it on DA and tumblr... but using those platforms is such a pain that I just gave up on looking for GW2 art there, and mostly only see that which is posted here.
---
Depends if you will play story then getting all mounts will take a bit, thou story will lead you to places where mounts can be aquired, the fastest way is start story get raptor and explore maps, do stuffs, events for xp and sooner or later you will run into places where you can get next mount, after Raptor it is like Desert Highlands - Springer, Riverlands - Skimmer, Desolation - Jackal, I personally played maps and got all mounts pretty quickly in a day I think, or if you not in a rush just do story plus stuffs for xp/masteries (which you will need to unlock new mounts) and you will get there, with griffon you can only get it after you finish whole pof story and you need to go to special place (there are guide online) and start griffon collection which will cost you 250g if nothing changed, at the end you have some boss fight and you get griffon, with guide if you have enough gold it is few hours of work, took me 3,5h I think but I was in a super rush.  I think other players give you even more info.. Honestly just have fun and take it easy to enjoy a game  you get raptor from first story instance so you will be already put in good position of "fast" traveling xD
---
Ugh, thank you.
---
THIS! Could we please buff something in PoF so that the maps come back to life. The Maw event is a event that deserves to be done more often so buff it!
---
Does it? The inscription is still really expensive and you get a mosaic daily. 
---
I'm sorry to hear your life isn't going as planned and feel the need to take it out on other people. Good luck with that, friend.
---
Sadly, I don't think even the wiki keeps track of Gem store availability history. 
---

Hah. I'm cool with this.
---
&gt;bow down to kids on a power trip.
---
If only you could have seen the things he was saying, both on the public discord and in private PMs to one of the mods. There's a good reason he was banned. It certainly wasn't due to "kids on a power trip".
---
However looks like they just put out a post they are nerfing it so meh
---
More importantly why is your bf not running food/utility? And why is he not getting boons like might/alacrity?  If he’s only 1k off those things will obviously put him over it. If he’s at the training golem he can just add boons from the console. If it’s in the fractal/raid that he’s not getting might/alacrity/etc. that’s a group issue not on him and should be brought up to the commander. And ofc he should be running food in actual encounters to help prop up his dps. 
---
There is nothing ensuring the protection of players' assets like in real world economics situations. Assets can be generated or removed from player accounts or the trading post at any time, so they are essentially unlimited and therefore inherently without value regardless of how common or rare they currently are in-game. In the real world, assets are finite, or associated with finite resources. Also, the trading post taxes serve no economic purpose whatsoever as they simply drain players' gold for no defensible reason.
---
But players aren't able change any of these things, through voting or anything else. Anet does only what Anet wants.
---
So. Real world economics - not really relevant here.
---
Once again proving how much you don't care by continuing to post.
---
Funny how the only things in this thread you're **not** sure of are the things that make you personally look like the piece of shit you claim everyone else is.  Strange since you're the self-proclaimed expert on shades of shit, you'd think you'd have taken ten seconds to identify your own.
---
Worth noting is that the ascended weapon itself provides a 5% increase over the exotic counterpart on its own, in addition to the 5% increase in stats from the armor/trinkets/weapon, for about a ~10% raw damage increase overall with full ascended (not counting crit bonuses)
---
Hmm .... hey ANet I have an idea :P
---
You can convert SW to something similar to the shitty treasure hunting kits! Opening a chest will consume&amp;require a shovel. Drop rate of shovels will be increased to compensate. This will simultaneously address the complaints about shovels being difficult to acquire for guild halls as well. Win-win right?!!!!
---
Nope, I just saw it on Twitter (I follow Nike) and thought people would want to discuss it.
---
lEtS uPvOtE tHiS cOsPlAy fOr HiGh qUaLiTy
---
&gt;Metas should be hard though.
---
Here's an idea:
---
&gt;Metas should be *done*.
---
You can argue all day about balancing, entitlement, difficulty, whatever, but the playerbase speaks with their actions. If they don't do the content, *the content needs looking at.*  
---
Perhaps GW2's players are incompetent, entitled morons who can barely manage to keyboard turn and click their skills, *but those are still the people who play the game.* If you don't market it towards them, they grow unsatisfied, leave, and you've lost your playerbase.  
---
It's no good saying that players need to be smarter/willing to do more work for less rewards, because whether you're right or not, that's not the way things stand, and a change to make the game appeal to players of that type is only going to kill it for the people that already play it without necessarily attracting anyone to replace them. Sure, in 5 years time perhaps the game will have been (re)discovered by a less casual crowd, but 5 years of having basically no playerbase to speak of would probably be more than enough to kill the game entirely, if it hasn't died of natural causes by then anyway (presumably succeeded by a sequel)  
---
If you want a game that grudgingly hands out a pittance of rewards for heroic effort, your best bet is to go out and try to find one. The chances of a ground-up conversion of an existing game that has a solid playerbase who ***wouldn't enjoy that type of game anyway*** is so low it probably requires exponential notation.
---
well idk about all, generally speaking revenant rotations tend to be fairly easier due to how the upkeep system works. half of the time its just pressing 1 or 2
---
Yeah we reached r/pokemon levels of screenshots xD
---
And we already had a rule about artists posting art but still being active in the community,  right? I remember this rule being posted ages ago, and started seing you being more active in the comments. So that plus the upvote/downvote system, really make this feel... meh. People avoid the official forums for a reason, and I don't like how "strict" this is getting :(
---
They were relevant till this game had a reason for a hardcore community and then they started losing relevance super fast as others popped up. So much for being the best.
---
It is funny, but then Nike is not someone anyone should take seriously. Dude lives to say stuff to ruin whatever reputation his community gathers over and over again.
---
I don't really understand this but I'd like to have the last word. :)
---
Already explained to another user, he was put on the spot to "prove himself" in front of a small group that tracked his DPS for him. He didn't have time to go and make/grab the proper foods before that. He fell short of the DPS minimum by ~1k, and the group even admitted he'd probably surpass the minimum with food were he given the chance beforehand to go make them, but they still didn't want him raiding with his set-up. They acknowledged that lack of food affected it, but kept pressing on his weapon choices/utilities as the reason. 
---
Dungeon gold/hour is on par with or higher than most other lvl80 farming content. It's not an issue of rewards, and they don't need to be buffed.
---
ok thank you for explaining to me.  
---
But players were being forced into Istan if they wanted to farm for gold/ materials, so nerfing Istan is actually going to give players more *freedom* to pick their farm.
---
Of course you would, because you don't care *oh so much*.
---
Well those are the areas where people usually have their duels.  It doesn't mean everyone in those areas will always be there for a duel.  It's also possible they were dueling and assumed you were going to interrupt it.  Usually if it's a 1v1 in the area, I don't interfere.  If you see other players standing by and watching, then it's almost certainly a duel.
---
Decent groups can reliably, successfully complete the event.
---
Crying that events are overtuned stops players from improving by removing the incentive to improve.
---
Let's make other events slightly harder rather than serpents ire easier. You know, progression of difficulty, to smoothen the learning process.
---
How can those people have a coffee break with good conscious when their product is such garbage. It's barely playable on CMs.
---
It'd be sad if they were relevant or this was "news". DnT died a long time ago, they just never said it out loud. I think this is mainly why most people won't care about it in that sense where we "lose" a guild in the scene. Because they were already gone for a while now.
---
If you like gold and volatile magic, yes. Istan's two metas gives a crazy amount of both.
---
Colour was also often renewed by redying or repainting, which often ended up in a riot of different hues.
---
Word
---
Rata Sum is Latin for I have thought/dreamt
---
The technology just isn't there.
---
Thread was moved to be not visible anymore
---
True. Barely playable. For some reason I thought it was quality of PUGs 
---
i dont see what this has to do with how real life economies and resources... you're adding waaaay too much complexity to this.
---
in a vurtual games economy some of the rules still apply.
---
...hyperinflation does happen to MMO's that constantly buff things and it is hard to fix without angering players.
---
Maybe its time to make raids more accessible to the majority of casual gw 2 players and then more content will roll faster?!  
---
Don't know just a thought.
---
On the contrary, this **stands out** because there's so very few people that use the standard ascended armor skins.
---
You do not have to rely on others to make yourself hardcore.  If you're truly hardcore, you shouldn't have much issue making your own version of SC.
---
istan was too good that's true but part of the problem is that other metas don't really worth it
---
Well, you'll still get close to 30 champ bags from Great Hall if you repeat it the same day.  That's still a better return than the big events from other Season Four maps...
---
And stuff like sandswept isles.
---
I'm happy Istan will get changed though, it's about damn time.
---
Maybe it's time to realise gw2 is in maintenance mode. 
---
As someone already mentioned, the new maps are filled with struggle, fights, branded, awakened ,all sorts of dangers. And even if we get allies and friendlies we have some sort of meta that pushes back and forth between them.
---
Someone also mentioned its because the maps we go to is because the commander that we play as is constantly chasing towards a larger threat.  
---
Core world was casual, and more exploration oriented and almost all of them (probably 18 /25) were happening at the same "time", the other 7 being in a similar time frame just because they have pact soldiers inside them).
---
This means we get to play as a "nobody", a adventurer thats helping out people, a explorer that maps out region after region and gets gift packs from the Tyrian Explorers Society. Even later in Orr we play as a "nameless soldier" that is part of a bigger picture of pact pushing towards Arah and THATS where i think the entire gameplay and "feel" changed.
---
Imagine we step down as a commander (because of spoilers) but still work with the pact and allies we managed to team up. Let someone else lead, imagine how different the maps would seem?  
---
But i do agree. Playing trough the PoF story and the last LW season story was amazing. But the maps them selves feel very... theme park-ish.
---
We use our mounts to zip trough maps and basically ignore ALL obstacles, be it gaps, canyons, forests, entire mountains, walls, buildings or mobs and environmental hazards like the brand which the maps are full of.   
---
We get from point a to b, from PoI, to Vista without anything that can stand in our way and hold us for even a second.  
---
We do renown hearts just to buy the daily map specific currency /material and move on.  
---
We let someone else tag up so they can collect people to a single map trough LFG so we can all turn into a blob of effects and aoe circles to blow our way trough metas and other events.
---
There are some spots you can explore, a lot of amazing screen shot material (tho usually you will get attacked by something all the time), and most of the new lore you get is by collecting some sort of scattered papers and placing them into a book which you can then read in a chronological order. That or we get some gw1 fan service by adding old characters like donkuro, talkhora, Koss, gwen... snaff and eir and more references to gw1 things.
---
Majority of gw2 casuals take pride in pressing 1 at world bosses and demand all the rewards so making raids more accessible WHICH THEY ALREADY ARE with how easy wing 6 was made wouldn't change anything.   
---
JUST A THOT
---
I've talked about it few times, but looking back at this game as a whole I am sure that, aside from the art team which has always been top notch, the game was being developed by two different teams that seemingly didn't communicate much. One responsible for the systems and one for the rest.
---
On one hand, you have arguably the most fluid MMO combat (at least back at launch it certainly was) pushing hard in the direction of competitive game, especially in forms of player vs. player. Just look at nearly every weapon at launch - typically half of the skills on each were utility and not used outside of PvP combat.
---
On the other hand, the game's marketing has always been striving for this image of The super casual MMO housewives can play for an hour a week and is actually against any form of competition in very nature.
---
This is where the split in the game's playerbase came from. You had a game with competitive spirit, in-depth combat system that could take a long time to get the proper hang of and classes designed for PvP combat in mind being marketed as the direct antithesis of these aspects. 
---
The result was a bunch of players lured by mechanical gameplay aspects being confused why is the developer seemingly doing nothing to support their competitive branch and a bunch of players lured by world, promises of friendly MMO who got thrown into MMO filled with experimental (at that time) concepts and advanced combat system they could never take advantage of. 
---
Today it's obvious that the second team has cannibalized the systems team remnants of try to redo big parts of the gameplay to fit more casual playstyles and PvE combat (skills which were previously utility now do damage to get them into PvE rotations, traits being remade into damage modifiers etc.), but a lot of us still wonder what this game could've become if the vision and direction was more consistent over the years. 
---
I suppose not many people remember this, but when GW2 was launching it's PvP interest was no joke - a huge part of WoW PvP community wanted to jump ships (worth a note this was a time when MOBAs weren't as big yet and there was a lot less competition for a PvP player), but PvP chances fell short because of lack of PvP infrastructure. 
---
WvW was also arguably the most finished game mode out of 3 and had a huge following, but years of ignoring it's needs took a toll. Which is a huge shame, because WvW is still the best RvR on the market and a niche GW2 is the best at, but developers skipped over it.
---
Sorry for the wall of text xd
---
Looks more like a lawyer about to make an objection lol
---
Dungeons were not really ever updated for ages, but before fractals and raids, that didn't stop people from doing speed clears all the time and records.
---
I remember Ben admitting in one of previous threads (months ago) talking about this bug they have no idea why it happens and they can't replicate it. It's actually funny to watch how powerless they are within an environment they created.
---
I would argue that the character select screen or using your phone is very low effort. We have incredible screenshots that people take of their characters where they choose a great location, lighting, even have someone else modify their camera for the picture to get it perfect. That is a high effort post.
---
Hitting print screen on the character select screen and uploading does not take any effort and it does get upvoted regardless as we've seen.
---
To be affected by every bug?
---
I misunderstood then, my bad.
---
&gt; **your** a non-native english speaker
---
You misunderstood me. I don't mean it wouldn't be worth the fix. I'd love a shiny new Zhaitan fight. What I meant is that it's not worth it if new content suffers because of it. As in we get a drought or weaker releases. 
---
But what baffles me is how it seems to be getting progressively worse. Missing fluxbomb indicators shouldn't be in the same genre as missing boss models.
---
&gt; How are people not outraged by this? Its absolute madness. And don't you freaking dare come and comment how "it doesn't happen to me so it doesn't exist" shit like you all do in every post. 
---
Well I only play Fractals occasionally and never ran into those bugs as far as I can tell. 
---
Maybe you are right, maybe its what needs to be done so Anet can put more resources into them.
---
I agree all your doing by separating these posts out, is trying to fragment the community. If those posts are getting more upvotes than important community issues, it means that this community does want the outfit pics and right here. 
---
riba is the run that never ends
---
it just goes on and on my friend
---
people started running it not knowing what it was
---
And now they'll keep running it forever just because..
---
well, because anet won't nerf it that's why
---
I think it is. they both are equally ignored.
---
But that wouldn't fix the most important part. The actual elder dragon battle which is the crux of the problem. Not the fluff.
---
Id love to see Nike's anti-raid rant reading of these comments in one of his youtube videos.
---
Where do i sign?
---
Incredibly annoying but Reddit only allows us 2 sticky posts. 
---
&gt; Art posts if they are something truly unique and special and the community shows its approval with upvotes will be allowed during the week. For example, the person who sculpted the Raptor mount or added their character to their PC case. For things like character portraits or landscape artwork, these should be moved to Sunday. 
---
So uh... I feel personally attacked. I recently posted a "landscape". I worked on it for around 15hours (actual work put in) and you're telling me it's on par with shitty fashion wars screenshots? Like... Thanks!
---
Also, o you mean in-game cosplay? Bc just "cosplay" is ambiguous...
---
I remember way back when this (https://www.engadget.com/2008/05/16/death-and-taxes-guild-disbands/) was news and giving it a bit of a shrug since they never really felt relevant towards the end of TBC.
---
However DnT in WoW always felt like a bigger, prouder and more relevant name than DnT in GW2. 
---
DnT been around for 6 years? lol. I just heard of them like 2 years ago.
---
really, why?
---
Granted. Easy mode raids are very easy, almost impossible to fail, but give no rewards.
---
I don't even have 1. I only ever found 1 group doing the meta and that was months ago. 
---
O you could just link me the build from the editor web site
---

+1. Re-evaluate Godnaz as a mod, the comments and attitude are not ok for a subreddit mod.
---
gamers need to rise up
---
Very good points all around.
---
It is a vocal minority but we have felt that they make some good points as a lot of posts never get any real attention even if they should and we thought that this might be a way to get it to happen.
---
I will admit that I am a bit shocked to see so much against it as in times when I had brought it up before there was almost unanimous support. But as I said, this is an experiment and nothing is set and stone and if it is an experiment that fails, then so be it. 
---
With regards to the posts you've brought up, I think we've done a pretty good job of removing most of those lately but as always please report things like that so we can deal with it, we do miss things.
---
Yeah nothing is set in stone yet and that's part of the reason why I wanted to get this out on monday so we have a long week to discuss and see what to do.
---
Bring back randomm!
---
I wish Mr. Borderline Ban to suffer under an own mental disorder. May this will reflect him his choice of words.
---
I do daily CM100, CM99 and t4 daily fractals. I run into these bugs every day. Even legendary brazen gladiator and last boss of chaos fractal were invisible today. Though a few moments into the fight they became visible.
---
You are correct. However the people who agree with you are progressively told to move to other games. Only when things really are dead do these others wonder what happened. 
---
It clearly wasn't because of elitism. It was an extremely low-effort shitpost; it was literally just a stock gw2 image with "GIT GUD" written on it. I'd prefer the sub to be free of shitposts, personally. 
---
Funny thing is how people mention on the new thread (about posting art/screenshot stuff on Sundays) that community already decides what they want to see or not by up/downvoting (so there's no need to schedule such day) but this thread already has lots of upvotes and it got taken down over all those no effort carebear posts.
---
Have you seen the other post about banning art except on sundays? It is starting to look like just no posts allowed.
---
It feels like we need to go find randommuser who has gone off the grid to a little shack by the sea where they are working on a boat to beg them to come out of retirement save this sub.
---
You are right. Politics is trash. At the same time, the political types just to get more aggressive  and dishonest by the day. The internet just makes it worse. I support the virtue of equality and that everyone should play by the same rules. I look at how the private sector is letting political extremists weaponize identity politics to the point that I wonder how much longer it will be before 'mind crimes' becomes a thing. When you realize that Patreon and credit card companies get to decide what you can and can't say, it's time to pay attention. 
---
You are the one who wanted to start a witch hunt against a sub user so your case will be discussed publicly, easy as that.
---
I like the change. If I see another "oh wow look at me, I just made my first legendary!" I'm gonna lose my shit.
---
People complain about lack of content on that sub, and how no one ever upvotes the posts that do get posted. If all these people that actually care about these type of posts go over there and actively posts and upvotes that kind of content, we wouldn't be having this issue right now. People are literally too lazy to just go to another sub.
---
How is this less effort than taking a pic with a phone?
---
**Newsflash:** an hour's worth of non-repeatable content once every 3 months is not enough to sustain this game's playerbase
---
One is harmless fluff. The other is drama inducing shit posting. If the 2nd post included "ways in which to git gud" then maybe it would have some merit in belonging I'm the subreddit, but alas it provided no substance. A person wanting a virtual pat on the back for an accomplishment from some strangers shouldn't really bother anyone.  
---
Yeah because gw2 requires no effort or skill so nothing interesting will ever happen on a stream.  This is exactly why gw2 has such lower viewership compared to the payer count.
---
The legendary outlaw!
---
&gt; Pugs still have a back warg. 
---
Yeah I love it when Glenna fucking dies because we decided to use the extremely unreliable Moa on it which doesn't fucking work half the time. 
---
&gt;Pugs range Deimos. 
---
Pugs do both.
---
&gt;Pugs don't portal eyes.
---
Implying literally anybody cares about eyes
---
&gt;Pugs don't throne tank. 
---
I love having all the DPS fucking die because they got knocked back into the throne during soul split
---
&gt;Pugs don't portal Qadim.
---
I love having spotty alacrity in pugs who take any power dps and not just daredevils
---
&gt;Hardcore players can make strats all they want but the pugs are still going to do their trash strats. 
---
Because pugs aren't hardcore players moron. Hardcore strats require hardcore players. Pug strats only require pug players. 
---
If you mean the Guild Wars 2 Path of Fire, that is shrunken on purpose to fit in the space that we have and also have our announcements there as well but have it be small enough to fit on smaller screens. 
---
How does it cost more to raid then the loot it gives?
---
But if it takes 30 mins anyway, what would a new system do better than current one?
---
Limiting the sharing of art is really, really dumb. 
---
I disagree with this, it would be so disheartening for someone new to the sub have their post removed for posting something on the "wrong day" when they are new to the game/sub and just want to participate. You can say "just read the rules" but most people wouldn't think about their post not fitting in because it's the "wrong day" I've had this happen to me before in other subs and it makes me feel like I'm not welcome there.  I would hate for the same to happen with this sub.
---
It's not accessible enough ? Put 1h work in a character and you can do half of the bosses. Gw2 has by far the most accessible end game content out there. The problem is people don't want to invest time and effort into it. If it's not done in 10 minutes of brainless auto attacking it's too hard for them and they brand it as not accessible to make themselves feel good.
---
I am not against people that don't enjoy or want to put in the effort for raids , it's not for everyone ,but complaining about them 24/7 is retarded.  
---
then they should add some bandaid code to it. I'd rather have 2 Boxes stacked on top of it each other than than an invisible boss.
---
Amazing. Well done!
---
Trading post
---
It's not sustainable and they lost a huge part of their fan base that pays the bills.
---
This same argument was used on PvP and wvw and everything else yet... focussing on casual content doesn't make the game grow. It doesn't even sustain its current population. 
---
End of life maintenance it is. 
---
Moa on wargs is very consistent, please don't spread misinformation because you don't know how to do it. You need to let the wargs attack you, then refrain from applying and conditions, CC, or damage onto them after that.
---
I think this is a very sensible and mature approach to take. Thanks for being open to feedback, and for the other replies you've made here.
---
I have mixed feelings about the topic, as I've taken advantage of the Sunday lull to actually announce events with the reasonable expectation that they'll get exposure. Obviously it's no effort for me to change the day I announce things, but it does make me wonder if the front page of the subreddit will actually have any content during the week if we remove most art and screenshots.
---
In recent weeks I only see one RIBA squad in the Silverwastes at peak hours. Six months ago I saw three. A year ago I  saw a minimum of five. Before that, six or more.
---
That's one of the most casual farm you can do and even that's drying up.  It's not just raids, friendo. 
---
This looks amazing! Mind saying what pieces are those?
---
Then that sounds like a guild you wouldn't want to be in anyway!
---
And yet it has sustained the game for more than 6 years.
---
Interesting. I'll forward this to the rest of the team and maybe someone can take a look at it.
---
Thanks a lot, that´s definitely a great start. What should I use the Black Lion Salvaging Kit for? I have like 4 of them.
---
I don't blame him, gw2's main market is targeted towards casual game play. Most of my friends who I used to hardcore raid with either quit or started selling raids, so I wouldn't be surprised if Nike starts doing that too. I tried come back to gw2 a few times, but got disgusted at the lack of pug raid squads every darn time. I'd prefer a game (like FFXIV) where I can log in and find the party finder full of life for savage raids... or even extreme primals... Unlike the pathetic raid lfg in gw2 &lt;_&lt;
---
Cant believe I didnt think of that, will do!  
---
And thanks for your answer.
---
Gonna be honest, only concerning oneself with the meta build is a quick way to turn a game into a bore. I keep a set of meta gear on hand for various characters to use, since optimal gear is pretty much identical for all classes, but I frequently run what would be referred to as gimmick builds. They're fun.
---
&gt; **Patreon doesn't allow hate groups.**   **Patreon doesn't allow hate speech.**  **Patreon gave each of these people chances to fix their standing with them and all refused.** 
---
Well...actually all of that is basically BS.  Different rules for different groups based on identity politics. Censorship is the tool of dictators. Political correctness can be just as abusive as fascism. It's too easy to blacklist people with false accusations of racism when no proof is required. Why do you think they always scream racism religiously? It's just easy too destroy someone like that. It's fun to abuse people and get away with it. When the private sector starts working with certain Left-wing political groups to do this....it's dangerous. Almost all of the censorship comes from the left wing these days. 
---
So grats on being on Hitler' and Stalin's side.  
---
Oh man Ajax Blue, remember him coming to do his WvW mouthbreather bit on Tarnished Coast back when server guesting actually was a thing and having a wild day in LA mapchat. Don't think he got the response he wanted from the RP server, but still was fun. Wonder where that guy is now.
---
Hey guys. Name i posted was meme name (try read it aloud ) , and i added wvw as clue why. But having u post so many nice ideas i may just make pve chrono with one of ur suggestions.  U guys are great :).
---
Also a very nice answer. I think I need to have a look at the Dungeon token system but your answer helps a lot. Thank you so much!
---
Gonna tack on my Herald build I used to use when HoT came out. Ran full Commanders armor with Berserker weapons and trinkets, Sword/Shield and Hammer, and just ran meta events and WvW zergs as a Boon Bot. Hard to kill, low-mid damage, but you could mindlessly play with perma ~20 Might (depends on runes/sigils), Fury, Swiftness. Super fun and made any non-challenging content a breeze. 
---
With which players? Even those guilds struggle to find fresh meat. 
---
Fair enough. I agree that somewhat difficult content should have slightly higher rewards. However, even that won't make it popular over easy farm for minimal effort.
---
Hard-core fractal 40 farm was much faster than open world farming, but still much more rare. 
---
But didn't the leader get his kills and just quit... kinda sucks for the rest of the guild
---
Someone said before, but, dont eat yellow snow !
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/search?q=level+80+boost&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all
---
All classes are viable (but game mode also affects this, not everything has good performance in every corner of the game) and fun is very subjective.
---
Nearly everything *you* just said is basically BS.  Is this all you can do?  Accuse someone of doing something right before you do it?  You did it in your last post, you did it in this one, and I can only assume you'll do it in the next one.
---
silly player, the endgame is buying/farming gold to get gems to then have access to the true endgame gear in the gem store.
---
Rewards increased....so you mean we get MORE greens...great
---
If you boost to lvl 80 now do you know what to do? And are you ready to fight more challange content then the core game offered?
---
You can ask for help in the map chat. People dont have to be in the guild, party/squad is enough to claim a guild hall.
---
Also:  
---
discretize.eu (for fractals)  
---
snowcrows.com (for raids)
---
But , see , to you and other "hardcore" people that seems like them adding a lot to the "scene". But it isn't . It's stifling. Do you know how insane it sounds to a majority of players that not only do they have to pick certain gear and traits , but LITERALLY have to PUSH THEIR BUTTONS IN A PRE-DETERMINED SPECIFIC ORDER ??!! To most people that sounds ridiculous, and they want nothing to do with such controlling madness.
---
I disagree. SW is like half the speed of Istan.
---
400w is enough. Quality over quantity. A bequiet system power 10 will fo the job.
---
&gt;  When I brought up this idea a month ago in the comments of a post complaining about the massive amount of screenshot/art posts there was near universal praise for the idea from everyone who replied
---
I'm pretty sure that is called an echo chamber. You asked for the opinions of people in a thread that was bias to those opinions. If you asked the same question in an art thread you would have likely got the complete opposite reaction much like you have here.
---
ICM used to have options to hide parts of the UI. I haven't checked it out in a while but it probably still has those.
---
Revenant is a fine class , but be warned - your skills 6-10 are set and cant be swapped around like other classes. They work more like weapon sets , each legend has 5 SET skills , and you can equip 2 legends at once and switch between them. So it's a bit more restrictive in setting skills
---
&gt;then next to nothing for the rest of the day.
---
Every HoT meta is completable pretty much every time it's up except Verdant Brink. Considering it can be 4am and I can still finish TD and DS there's plenty of people still doing them. 
---
Idk if you're joking? I got 28g from my last serpents ire and I almost always get 7g+
---
You are acting as if they died or something. I am absolutely sure US players will still see DnT members around just as we, EU ones see qT.
---
One day of t4+rec is 20g. One raid fullrun is 80-100g.
---
bring back randommuser

Bring back randomm, remove gudnaz!

This sounds like the lamest fix ever, but it worked on my PC after having the Event Logger going nuts on my harddisk for months now; change your power plan configuration under Control Panel from Balanced to High Performance. I have no effing idea why it fixed my problem, but it did.
---
To be fair, I did that meta 50 times and only once did an npc get stuck.
---
Wait what? How?
---
Look lady, I only speak two languages: English and bad English.
---
While Istan may have been overtuned compared to other things....no one in this community wants more to be added to our "daily play cycle".....

&gt; Guildwars 
---
Please don't call this casual cashgrab "Guild Wars".
---
We're talking about Guild Wars **2** which is a barely related product.
---
&gt; the more hardcore scene has just been falling apart
---
Not surprising. In the old WoW days people were hardcore because it was the only game and it was designed that way. Once the MMO boom happened people realized they don't like to play hardcore. Most games are designed to try to make everyone happy and the hardcore audience is so tiny nowadays.

It's actually quite easy to find /shrug
---
I just reinstalled and logged in for the first time since release, I had '1-6 year character birthday gifts/mail' waiting for me just for a reference.
---
My character is a lvl80 Guardian.
---
My main issue is that I have no inventory space, all my bags are filled with stuff that I have no idea if I should trash it or if it's useful.
---
1. Should I trash any gear I have sitting in my bags? Since there have been 2 expansions since I've played... maybe it's not worth hanging onto anymore?
---
2. Do I need to buy both expansions at this point in my characters progression?
---
3. I noticed my character is still gaining experience even though it's lvl80, is there some kind of leveling past this?
---
When I logged in I saw the way character builds/talents have changed (don't remember how they worked then either). I know I need to research how my class plays now, I really just need to get my inventory issue sorted out and it's pretty overwhelming right now since all my bags are only 15 slot each.
---
I'm completely in the dark on anything GW2 related since back when it released, I can't remember much about what I did while playing back then other than checking off nodes on the map and doing 'public events'.
---
I'm ok with spending money if anyone has a suggestion on what I absolutely need to buy to make the game more manageable.
---
Thanks
---
You know what got the other 2 MMOs faster raid content production and was stated by both as needing to be done or they'd have to slow raid production even further? Making an easier version. 
---
It becomes far more worthwhile to invest the resources into making something when 50+ percent of your population touches it instead of 1. People don't like when GW2 follows other MMOs idea so everyone has been far to against it yet somehow still bitch raids take to long to make. Wow...big surprised something people barely do they don't have much drive to work on. 
---
Am I glazing over some interesting information, or is this basically just "yes, this is a thing we did, stay tuned"?
---
oh fuck you got me again!
---
Very true.
---
If anything this will allow you to do more things than just Istan to make gold. It's a good thing when it comes to variety. But they need to do this for the rest metas as well.
---
Unfortunately most are on the gemstore for a few hundred gems, so it is real money or a few hundred gold using gold to gems, but there are 2 musical bells on the tradingpost and they are really cheap. There is also 2 that are tied to expensive weapon skin but they are in the thousands of gold.
---
http://imgur.com/oOeKIS4
---
As far as I know you can get them in the gem shop. If you don't want to spend money you can farm gold and convert it to gems. For efficient gold farming is probably the Domain of Istan the best region but it is an 80 lvl region and part of PoF. I don't know any other way but would be happy to know one. 
---
so, yeah... I've read this, but I don't know anything about the game yet, so I don't understand much of what it's saying... do I need to have the expansions or have gems for it?
---
Wrong. You still get phylacteries and unid gear from all the mobs. Also VM. Chests are only a part of the equation. If anything this will just balance it better with SW.
---
&gt;  For marketing, raids ist important i think
---
This is insanely flawed thinking. Sure, streamers can draw in more but you're acting like that is more important than actual in-game numbers. We don't know how many people do raids, the only thing we can do is look at players in the raid area and LFG. If you compare that to say meta maps or fractals its insanely low. The players in-game is whats important since they're spending money.
---
But that doesn't matter, since most event mobs doesn't drop anything at all. You get your maint loot from bandit chests and breach/labyrinth event and both aren't affected by DR, you always get your champion bags.
---
They added it as a way of saying they're not making PoF specific legendaries.  So it's a way for people who don't have HoT to still be able to make them.
---
im hoping the story will slow down a bit in the next season.
---
i mean the commanders not really had a break since the end of heart of thorns... small scale story is important too...keeps things grounded and makes the grand scale epic stuff feel more grand and epic as a contrast.
---
i think you don't need them to own an instrument but it's easier to get an instrument through the expansion. 
---
Right click to unlock the skin and then apply the other skin.
---
Can you provide some evidence of this?
---
To start, you're contradicting yourself in saying the "raid scene" is both influential enough to prevent an "easy mode" (which is supposedly the way to save the content and ANet would do it if not for this "raid scene") yet also inconsequential enough that they get no content in the first place. I'm going to go out on a limb and say you're just 100% wrong because that doesn't make sense.
---
I can be generous and assume you are saying they're releasing so little raid content because they've put their resources towards content that's played more. But that also doesn't hold up to scrutiny.
---
I see four LS episodes a year, each with 3-4 hours of story, a legendary skin, a couple of weapon/armor sets, and a mount mastery, and 50% chance of a new Fractal or something like that. And then 1 new raid wing and a couple of QoL updates.
---
This is not giving me the impression that ANet is merely working on the more heavily consumed content in GW2. It's making me think they're just plain unable to produce any content at a reasonable, sustainable clip.
---
I have not. Reading was a bit funky for some time due to how tit wrapped, but I don't think I could live without it now. It's a subtle curve. 
---
Yeah I'm sure I was the only douche on discord ;-) Thanks!
---
Sry i used a German site, but that's where i buy my computer parts, they tend to be quite cheap and it's rather easy to explore, well at least for me.
---
Ok, let's look at it. It's GW2 so, we want intel if we can, with 4 cores lets say. And since we are on a budget... I'd say: i3 8350k, with better core performance than anything AMD put out and low cost because, well it's i3. Shouldn't even be much of difference between i3 and i5 in gw2 performance. (i3 9000 series doesn't exist yet, but imo it should come during this year, also AMD is putting out zen2 cpus)
---
As for graphics, i guess you can go cheaper, but i was comparing, 1060, 2060, 580 and 590. 2060 is way out of price range of other 3, so eliminate that. 1060 vs 580 is a win for 580, because of price and 590 wins because it's better than 1060 with about the same price. So i went with 590, because i feel like it's still within budget, but by all means take 580.(there might be some new stuff comming in following months)
---
16GB ram is standard these days.
---
SSD is a budget version with only 500GB, but this has to be the easiest thing to add if you need more.
---
520W PSU from seasonic should be enough to run all of this and have wattage to spare, but because we are on a budget i selected bronze efficiency, but it's still seasonic, so top quality. It's cheaper than 450W PSUs for some reason.
---
Now you only need a case and you're done.
---
Hyper 212 is pretty standard cooler to add, that isn't completely low level, but if you aren't going to overclock (you almost should with this one, at least a bit), you can get something cheaper. CPU doesn't come with cooler for some reason.

---
My guild discord had a thorough vent about the announcement; the theory I picked up either there or somewhere in this reddit thread is the idea that anet will probably be rolling out another farm in the future.  May as well shelve anything strictly gold related until we see which way the wind is blowing.
---
I played Warframe pretty heavily last summer and cooled off around the time Jahai was released - I had time to do the daily catacombs puzzle in Thunderhead this weekend but was locked out for 20+ minutes due to ghosts.  I used that time to update the Warframe game client and logged in for the first time in a couple of months.
---
Ehh, not have to be.  It'd be nice, that's all.
---
What else do we get? One fractal every 200 days? What is there to do in this game? WoW is just a memory. Every big content creator left the game cause it's gotten so casual. Every single PvE guild in GW is dying and you somehow don't see any problem with it. You obviously hate raids in any game. [Have fun watching this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqBN5NAdtvk)
---
I'm special, so are you.  Thanks!
---
Thank you!
---
Couple of reasons. Fee increases, plus arbitrary censorship. Patreon's banning of Sargon of Akkad seems to be what has sparked the recent avalanche of both creators and supporters leaving the platform. Googling will return a lot of info on this, but here's one link.
---
https://podnews.net/update/patreon-controversy
---
Whether you like Sargon or not isn't the issue.. It's Patreon's arbitrary censorship that any right thinking person should be concerned about. 
---
Oh shit youre right, I should have wrote 500, but then again I was trying to be safe with the new cards since I told him to wait for new stuff... 
---
So just to clarify. If I already have 250 gold getting the gryphon will take me no longer than a day ?
---
Wait, I didn't say anything to mods in PM.  I didn't say ANYTHING to ANYONE in PM.  You're showing your ass, here.
---
Getting into and gear costing stuff is not the same. You can gear a character up from 0 for about 200-300gold. 3 weeks of raiding and you have the money back. If you do fractals every day on top of that its 1 week.
---
Ahaha at first the hat looked like a face mask
---
Like Wesley from Princess Bride. But looks cool dude! 
---
Don't forget worlds first character
---
why is he not mod anymore?
---
I can see why you were banned. You seem pretty insufferable. 
---
I don't have any toons that low level sadly. But I have a stack of like 100+ yellows just sitting wondering if I should stack MF before I open (only have like 90 MF clean). Do you just sell the exotics and stuff you get straight to the TP or do you break them down then sell? 
---
Depends on too many factors, but you can see both of those types of players everywhere in the game.
---
Did you really expect that Anet would spoil their own future story?
---
yes but it still made a lot of people quit the all together. When I  started this game, my main activity was dungeons. When they stopped adding new once, I quit the game until HoT. I know many people who did aswell. 
---
It's been a very long time since both happened so I probably could if I looked long enough.
---
Both WoW's LFR and FFXIV's story mode raid content came for a reason and both with the same statement. They went into the next raid tier/expansion and realized. Hey guys, very few peopple touch this and raids take A LOT of time to make. It's really hard to justify all this effort for so little return. Even WoW having had raids as mainstay since launch the devs admitted without LFR raid production would slow down. 
---
The reason raid production is so slow in GW2 is very likely the same reason. Raids are all unique. They require a ton of art budget, a ton of story budget, and are a driving factor of technical budget. But the problem lies its just such a massive amount of work for no return. The easy mode raid scene exists to give value to that time. If suddenly 50% of the player base is seeing these new things, experiencing new things, and at least getting some minor reward from them. It pulls people in and keeps people having something new to do. 
---
Maybe they are just incompetent at making raids and this would change nothing. But when the other main examples both came out with identical reasons for why they made the change. It's pretty easy to assume it's at least worth a shot here because as much as Anet wont admit it; GW2 is not that different from other MMOs at all. 
---
Yeah, I know I don't have to bow down to anyone.  And I am in a cool guild.  I just would like to come back, is all.  I know I'm dealing mostly with kids :-) It's cool.  Thanks.
---
Either way, my highest chars are 30-43...so...not ready anyways

so are they not that fun then?

&gt; I've also seen some people say they almost don't feel like playing anymore in the immediate aftermath.

Nah, much like most of the "impactful" moments that have happened in GW2 I fully expect that we'll be chasing a new McGuffin in an episode or two and we'll just never talk of Aurene or what has happened here at all.
---
It's just going to be another thread snipped out of the tapestry just as it was starting to coalesce into an image for no reason other than that the narrative team at ANet seems to think that's how you do story telling. Same as Zojja, same as the Pale Tree, same as Malyck, same as Trehearne, same as Kiel (and the Captain's Council as a whole), same as Mister E, same as all Tengu matters, same as Sayeh al' Rajihd, same as most things in this game if I'm honest and etc... doesn't just seem to nail down how often we're thrown a narrative bone that doesn't end up having any meat.
---
It suffices to say, there are enough unresolved plot points in GW2 now that I could make a king size sheet set and comforter from the lot of them and demand the poshest of asking prices for the high thread count materials I'd used.
---
sPvP is equalized to level 80, with equal level stats.
---
WvW relies on PvE stats, but you can join sPvP at any time
---
Ofc I had to bring my bad luck over to gw2 just after 2 days when I came back, fml 🤐
---
Yet, that's what they are doing. Crazy.
---
For Dye Kits. Go to [Celebratory Dye](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Celebratory_Dye_Pack). At the bottom of the page put in your [API key](https://account.arena.net/applications). Pick the most expensive dyes. You can't sell them, but it's more bang per buck.
---
If it takes you 30 minutes to fill daily cm + t4 group you are doing something wrong or playing at the wrong time. Either not specific enough or too picky lfg post.

[The always-wonderful Warrior shout healer. Just give me an elite spec to go with it and it will take over the meta!](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vJAQNBiSDbknDaBxOPwyDoDxQVQlvQXnCaP0C5AuAbdAA-jBCCQB1Y/h7dRAAwDA4P6GmwRAwrK/4k6PjVJIpA8bmF-e)
---
As far as PvP? Hooh, just stay away, or find a guild first and roll with them.
---
WvW is way more tolerant  to randos.
---
Oh, finally. It's bizarre how slow Anet is to address mega-profitable metas, especially when players tend to find out how to comedically exploit it within the first month..
---
I wonder if they'll do anything about Great Hall and the fantastic game of engineer turret-tag.
---
250 is a pretty decent amount of gold, I think most would say it isn’t rich or anything, but it also is enough to help you towards things like half a set of max gear or max weapons. I’m not an expert on where to gold farm but that would probably take me around 10 or so hours to get straight if I were to do popular event like Istan.
---
I see. Good for him.
---
If you were to straight up farm it would take like maybe 10-15 hours of farming if you are efficient. Personally I wish there was more inflation in the game since when I was playing WoW back in the day I would have 1 or 2 thousand gold and that was just an average amount. I don’t like how modern WoW players have tens of thousands or a million gold, I think that’s too much. But in gw2 I normally have like 50 and that is still kind of underwhelming
---
&gt;We're not missing ANYTHING by letting customization posts do well on off-season news periods. It'd be completely fair to have stricter moderation during times where something important or interesting is happening, but during downtime, who is it hurting really?
---
This is the root of these complaints every time and I'm surprised after being ignore for so long they decided to act now. It all comes from the people who likely less frequent reddit. They come in at a new release and read up on all the new stuff. Over the week or two they see a lot of threads about all the fancy new content and items, but then more time passes and it slows down. They think "Why the fuck are all these 'non-content' posts here wheres my discussion and cool stuff".
---
There's only so long people can talk about a certain release before things slow down. Within a week without all these kinds of posts there are times the sub will slow to a crawl because sometimes there's not much to say.
---
TIL I'm the very definition of a casual playing a theme park... dammit.
---
I like how he says Aurene eating Joko was a waste. SHE HAS BEEN DEAD FOR 1 MINUTE DUDE!
---
This will always be a relevant meme.
---
if you want to talk about new lands
---
...i really want to see east of ascalon...where presumably the ash legion homelands are.
---
Depending on your play time, these goals, excluding the mount, can be reasonably obtained in under a month. The mount will likely take around a month, depending on whether the RNGods smile upon you or not.
---
I see, thank you very much, man, your explanation was just perfect, I have no more doubts
---
Oh damnnn! You're a legend mate!
---
Thank you so much for this detailed guide, really helped. I used to be into PC parts a few years back but slowly dropped it unfortunately. Thanks for the market tip too!
---
I'll take it, since I'm not moving for at least half a year I think, so I'll just be on the lookout and try to get back into the components game. 
---
Also, one more question. 
---
What kind of a monitor should I aim for? I was thinking of 144Hz since it looks really nice (for LoL, doubt I'll get 144 FPS in GW2 lol).
---
Or would it be fine to go for 2 60Hz monitors? 
---
Once again, thanks a lot. 
---
Go for a build that will make you faster than mounts. Dodges short biw swiftness. Then try to race and beat at least a few players. Dont know how youll do that but thats where the fun lies.
---
I'm just responding to the guy saying pugs get strats from hardcore guilds. I'm saying they don't.
---
Full exotic gear will take you one maybe two days, if you take your time through the expansion it might take you 3 or 4 days to get through the story, then maybe 2 or 3 additional days to get the griffon. A good looking set varies depending on what you like, but there is some good looking gear that isn’t too bad. It takes about an hour or two to get enough hero points to get a full elite spec, but if you just play through the expansions you will casually come across enough hero points for you to for sure max it out by the time you are halfway through the second expansion
---
To put in perspective, the most expensive item on the trading post is 3800 gold, but it also happens to be a legendary, but there aren't that many items that will go for that much. 250 isn't a lot, but it isn't a little either. 
---
If that is the case OP has no one to  blame but themselves. If you are going to reject a chunk of people before they even join then of course it is going to take a while.
---
"Dramatic ending". Please, we just had this on the front page a few days ago.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aeyx4z/please_stop_tagging_a_post_as_spoiler_then/
---
FYI: No one likes a flipper. Artificially increasing prices without adding to the market leads for exponential inflation.
---
While denying art posts is obviously not a good idea, flooding the sub with 'fashion" isn't a good idea either! Who'll decide what's unique? I certainly didn't see anything unique on those fashion wars screenshots. I think we should keep both GW2Style and /r/GuildWarsDyeJob alive instead of using this sub as a main one for fashion matters. And GW2Style even have quite convenient search option.
---
complexity was already there when they said they hired an economist
---
I love it...
---
In what way is "dramatic ending" a spoiler?
---
You look.. uhh so.. err.. pretty?
---
Or witty banter at that.
---
The PvP community is completely toxic. If you are sensitive to people raging or whispering you or reporting you for “throwing the match”, stay out of PvP. But the PvE community isn’t like that at all in my experience
---
Uhh so like this sub is going to be 100% text posts now except for 1 day? There isnt an active enough community to do this lol 
---
WoW is the largest MMO around and has dedicated subs for many other things. Yet all thos things still show up on the main subreddit because the community isn't dumb. The main subreddit for games exist as a hub of everything and what people want most at the time. The art isn't shutting anything out because people post art all the time. There's not always new riveting discussion and new content to talk about.
---
&gt; That not stuff that is hard to fix, seriously.
---
Ah yes, the cry of every armchair developer.  Just type "do fix: purple_room_thingy;" right?
---
"yes these are theories that exist!"
---
This is beyond awesome. I hope to have made one of these at some point. 
---
This makes me want to play all of my alts and give them makeovers.
---
The skin is unlocked.
---
The more they said about fan theories the more chance there was of them slipping up and saying something they shouldn't.  I'm honestly not surprised they refused to say very much in response to that portion of the interview.
---
did you know MMO's are often used in economics classes because they're really great self contained economic simulations that behave like real world economies? there's differences but the basic rules are the same.
---
i was talking about things like real life asset protection and resource scarcity. those are irrelevant...yes anet can remove peoples assets at any time...and all scarcity is artificial and can be corrected by anet at any time...
---
but they don't...they let this machine run itself... its the lifeblood of a game like this so they cant afford to toy with it on a whim without forethought.
---
Why? If they talk about it from that perspective, they're essentially speculating about their own story, and I don't see how that is productive. It's the fan's task to speculate about the story... 
---
That's just the nature of writing for MMOs, dude. Story the writers 100% intend to make it into the game sometimes gets cut for reasons totally beyond their control. Combine this with staff changes, time crunches, etc. and things can get lost. If it's enough to get you worked up over, you might need to take a break.
---
Yeah he literally started with "Dont bother mate. That stuff was fun to read but no way i am spoiling the coming story releases" before they even got into it.
---
Unfortunately not. I have done everything and all collections now besides for this one single achievement and the focus one that is also messed up. 
---

---
It won’t let me for a skin. I’m not talking about a weapon - I’m talking solely about a skin, like the Zenith Weapon Skins
---
Anet was bad at advertising their game then and they still suck at it now.
---
I'll echo the same stance I've had every time a subreddit dedicated to a specific game has a post saying "X aspect of the game doesn't belong here, put it in the dedicated sub"...
---
As the main, overarching Guild Wars 2 subreddit, *all* aspects of the game belong here. Discussions, achievements (first Legendary/Map Completion/etc.), fan art, character screenshots, erotica fanfics between the player character and the Elder Dragons... all of it.
---
The existence of a dedicated subreddit for a specific aspect of the game does not mean that aspect should not be welcomed on the main subreddit. Does the existence of /r/competitiveoverwatch mean that topics about Competitive and the OWL shouldn't be allowed on /r/Overwatch? Does /r/summonerschool mean that /r/LeagueofLegends shouldn't allow new players to ask for help?
---
If you don't like the screenshots of people's gear/dye jobs, no one is forcing you to look at them. Hide them, downvote them if you want. There may even be a way to hide them with the subreddit CSS (if they're flared properly).
---
Banning a certain type of content because it's too popular or "belongs somewhere else" doesn't tend to work out well. Just look at what happened the times they tried to ban/remove game highlights from /r/Overwatch. The sub dried up because there's just not that much to discuss on a day to day basis. Something like the proposed Show Off Sunday can be a good compromise.
---
**TL;DR -** As the main Guild Wars 2 subreddit, *all* content related to the game belongs here, even if a dedicated subreddit also exists. 
---
I know, it just reminded me.
---
You can have both accessible, and challenging raid content.
---
It's called difficulty modes, every other game with a healthy raiding mode has figured it out.
---
"IT'S MA'AM"
