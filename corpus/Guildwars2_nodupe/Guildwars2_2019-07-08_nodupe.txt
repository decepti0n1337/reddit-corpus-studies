It's cute that you think they had a QA department.

how do
---
Dual pistol demon hunter necro.
---

---
Longbow elemental archer elementalist
---
&gt; this build can be used for mobility with skills like Bladestorm
---
Bladestorm for mobility? O_o
---
Jawgoues is prob so mad right now! A tattoo gets 1000 upvotes Hahahahahah
---
It's unclear how they decided, or how split the view was.
---
But Kiel's showed to be more realistic than the other captains. So I'd blame the rest, not Kiel, personally. They're the dumbasses who said Scarlet wouldn't attack the same place (LA) twice.
---
Well, that sounds like an exploit if I ever heard one...
---
The power creep isn’t as high as you’re claiming; you forget Alacrity used to be 66% and 33%, GOTL used to give dps % dmg buffs, boons were able to be given 10 man by 1 Chrono. The overall damage differential between start of HoT and now isn’t super crazy high; more people are also better at the game now, there are better resources for how to do things, things like DPS meters and DPS golem exist now, better strategies have evolved through time, etc. Most of this doesn’t really fall under the definition of “power creep” and what I’ve listed above is the biggest factor for why things are easier than they used to be as opposed to just flat numbers and damage being significantly higher than HoT launch
---
&gt;go create your own pug squad and then you'll see what's tolerating bullshit.
---
&gt;Nobody is forcing you to be in my squad, you can create ur own - and if you want to then stfu and play the damn game.
---
I usually do, and most days, it goes fine when people actually carry their weight instead of expecting to be carried.
---
&gt;People like you and OP can only complain and demand.
---
If the group expects a certain amount of LI or KPs, it inherently expects a certain level of performance and experience with the fight.
---
&gt;I'm 100% certain that my 100 Li friend in my 250 Li group is doing less harm than people that leave after few seconds due to trivial reasons.
---
Is it really trivial if your 100 LI friend is consistently screwing up a mechanic and causing full party wipes?  That's what the OP is complaining about.
---
&gt;I don't owe a raid spot to any PuG, if you want to raid in my squad you play by my rules.
---
And any skilled player doesn't owe you their performance to carry someone who's obviously under-performing.
---
You mean like that time there was a living world episode that broke the entire game for almost a full day and the episode instances themselves weren't working?
---
Bugs happen in games. It's the weekend. Biggest mistake here is trying to line up the bonus events with the regular weekly reset (which is intentionally timed for the weekend) because it makes bugs take longer to respond to until they are all back in the office on Monday.
---
Balance is mostly subjective and will never be 100% fixed. There will always be complaints on the forums about this even if balance was “the fairest possible”
---
I just want more hairs and faces that aren't Elonian or Olamakan.
---
Now THIS is a quality response on constructive criticism, and I appreciate the write up!

With this specific piece, it was first time go at repainting with this sort of medium. I typically paint Warhammer minis as my main go to, so this large of a single mini was a bit unwieldy at times. Your expansion on the model for the extra details and small color variations is an excellent point, if I were to tackle this another time, I would use a darker silver to start with rather than a bright silver that really makes it more difficult to play with shading and additional metals along with it (darker or lighter). Weathering with the scratches would add flavor to it as well, with the color being more dim that is. Same with the sword hilt, the tone is broken up a bit with the oil wash over it, but could likely use some additional separation of the color, perhaps even another wash and more weathering done on it. All your points are valid I feel and really push the critique up a notch.
---
That all being said, I took these moments before handing it off to the client before they headed out of state, so it's not the best lighting or camera work. I also was limited in the amount of time that I could tackle this, as the client would be moving out of state soon and I wanted to get it to them before the move. So focusing on the face made the most sense, a lot of the characterization is there! I also wanted to keep to the roots of the in-game model and some of the artwork I could find. While not an excuse, it was a reason for only taking some artistic licenses with it. At least I got the face right!
---
In all, thank you for the feedback. It's rare to get such a great piece of criticism.
---
I would rather have new weapons for the core specs. Like Scythe, landspear, greataxe. I don't see another expac happening though.
---
&gt; You mean like that time there was a living world episode that broke the entire game for almost a full day and the episode instances themselves weren't working?
---
That prevents people from playing it but doesn't affect PvE in general. The equivalent would be if people couldn't pick up the skills at all after killing someone or it gave skills from the wrong class.
---
I have had Total Makeover Kits refunded before, explain the situation and you might get some help.
---
thief G R E A T S W O R D
---
Ayyy you know it.
---
I have this too, it’s so frustrating. Submitted a bug report about it, but I really want it gone.
---
Given that it simply involves stowing weapons wait for every single player use it then see how broken it is.
---
Hell effing no.
---
Bladestorm should be used for primarily damage, and secondarily to hard rush enemies who are pew pewing with projectiles.
---
It's not basic human decency to try to help people trying to deceive them though? There is a line that when crossed kind of changes things which I'm not sure you're understanding of, maybe if it would ever happen to you it would make sense.
---
These are great and giving me ideas
---
I like it as long as you can let people catch up to JUUUST about where they can clear some dungeons so they can be normal raid ready. No azerite fuckery or sucks for you kind of thing.
---
Wait...you can FLY? ... haven't played in a long, long time...(since just after Heart of Thorns release, I think)
---
Yeah, D/P feels busted in comparison! I got a friend to try the game for the first time and he nearly got to Platinum in sPvP just using the default D/P build.
---
lol this is the reason i can't muster the motivation to come back. It's like the devs tried to add stuff to wvw once, people were luke warm to it, and the devs said "fuck you guys" . It was pretty unique and had a pretty active community
---
I wanted the symbol from commander banned back piece but there's no clear render of it
---
Oh, these look pretty nice. The lines and shades are also quality works from the artist. These were lovely choices as a tattoo commander ;)
---
&gt;Is it too late to start at guild wars 2?
---
MMOs take about five years to become worth playing so you're good.
---
&gt;I've heard that it costs a lot to get
---
Just the cost of the expansions. You can get everything *you need* just from playing. The griffon and the like are just optional flex.
---
I have one idea for one I main guard and  ever since HoT I've been drawing a symbol that's a cross between the guardian symbol and the dragon Hunter symbol I call it "the guardian Hunter emblem" hoping to get that one done one day
---
Nah, OP is just raising awareness for prostate cancer. Good guy OP.
---
I don't think its elites only normal utilities
---
Just rename the game mode to URF and can it intended!
---
i dislike cathcup mechanics as well.
---
i remember playing wotlk and no one ran naxxramas or ulduar because "they were old, do pit of saron instead". or farming emblems of frost. it seemed a total waste of content and a bore of a farm.
---
cataclysm handled it better, at least before dragon soul...
---
aside from mystic clovers, you'd want to start accumulating the dungeon token needed for it. check wiki for the various sources of mystic clovers - dailies, pvp/wvw reward tracks, etc
---
the dungeon token, you can get from doing dungeons or via the pvp/wvw reward tracks
---
I'm not an amazing player or anything but I prefer dagger/pistol over sword/dagger. If you'd like to know more let me know, I think the build is one of the metabuilds on meta battle; if not I can link you my build.
---
Sweet Jesus that's dedication.  What's it translated in New Krytan?
---
Make the clovers before buying the rest of the t6 mats you need since you will acquire some during the forge process.
---
To be fair, I use scorpion wire all the time anyway, it's a really useful utility.
---
Ele would probably be unable to double sword since main hand is locked onto weaver. And to give sword to 2 elite specs of same class in a row, idk if Anet wold do that before exploring the remaining weapons.
---
...damn, now I'm imagining Taimi with a x3-face playing kitten-like with a grumpy Rytlock's bushy tail end.
---
/u/lishtenbird, doooo eeeeeeeet.
---
That was amazing!
---
I have to admit, I've thought about getting the downed state icon put on me somewhere, but my hubby would blow a gasket.
---
I'm just glad this buggy clusterfuck is going away at the end of the week rather than receiving three patches and then sticking around forever while still causing issues like the warclaw or the desert BL.
---
So you are so good you won't raid with them. Elitism meter is at its max dude
---
From what I've heard, yes, but the previously summoned thieves despawn when the new ones come in. So you can't get an army of NPC teefs.
---
You're not understanding anything in the discussion.  It's not *just* that you have a friend with 100 LI.  It's having an under-performing player in your squad that you refuse to do anything about and the theoretical of advertising on the LFG for experienced players while having someone who's inexperienced within the party who doesn't meet those requirements already.  That's what OP has a problem with.
---
Wordly Impact is designed to be a bursty attack, so the only real way to mitigate it is interrupting the cast (same animation as finishing) or outright dodging it.
---
My static rarely had trouble killing bosses (other than Deimos and sometimes Sab - mostly because we only killed them if people wanted them) and it was full of WvW players who frequently had pretty bad DPS.
---
I think a lot of people underestimate how important attitude is to success or failure. Lots of pug groups fall apart after one or two pulls but that same group would fly through bosses once they warm up and most people's performance goes up.
---
Lots of really successful statics are full of average or even below average raiders but they succeed because people have a better attitude towards working with each other and toxicity is really low.
---
This works on all classes btw, but is particularly strong on holo. I'm guessing shroud will also trigger it similarly. For everyone else it's just cancelling the switch to stolen/normal skills with weapon swap or stow. Maybe devs were just careless or lacked sleep, but I think there is a bug during every event. I don't think it will be disabled or fixed if they don't patch by Monday or Tues at the latest, they may just let it run its course. It's also kind of lame that the person in the youtube video actively promotes his exploiting of the game mechanics - he even posted a video of himself using warclaw to get into enemy garrison and put it on reddit as if it was some kind of good thing, and sadly most people missed the part about him using his warclaw to get in. Anyways, maybe it's just best to enjoy the bonus xp for this event if anything.
---
I have not played it but [https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Thief\_-\_Marauder\_S/D](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Thief_-_Marauder_S/D) looks nice.

Joke's on you! It clearly actually says:
---
**I can not outrun a centaur**
---
I play it on a old dell xps i7 2700 with a gtx 525m... you can play with anything
---
Just bought the 2600 like...a month and a half ago &gt;.&gt;
---
Not really related however...what armor was the player next to you using?? Ty
---
That's not a player, it's an NPC, and it's human t1 light, I believe.
---
I can

Did you really have to ask if a 2017 piece of technology can run a game from 2012?

I didn't know we pvped lol that's news to me

But he will move faster while wielding a hammer and atk speed is somewhere between sword and greatsword. 
---
The new F1 skill summons a giant hammer, where 5 people can hide behind. It will knock out nerby enemies and grant stealth to you (and your group) if the hammer is between you and your enemy. The hammer will also spawn throwable stones (look at weapon skill 5), which cause knockdown.
---
Weapon 1: standard bam bam bam, but ridiculous fast.
---
Weapon 2: Similar to [this](https://youtu.be/_Svf8yTaM2A?t=117) attack... but with a hammer. 
---
Weapon 3: A mix between Ranger sword 3 and Guardian hammer 4. Make a dodge roll behind the enemy and knock him back. 
---
Weapon 4: Hit the ground and whirl up some dust -&gt; aoe that causes blind. 10% chance to spawn a Dust Mite Twister that fights with you.
---
Weapon 5: Hits the enemy heavily, if the attack succeeds, the head of the hammer will break and you will fight with a staff from now on -&gt; replaces all weapon with Daredevil's staff skills. You won't be able to change back to hammer until you are out of combat or find a throwable stone on the ground.

Time to start Downloading! I’ve heard the pvp is great which is why I’m trying it out, any opinions?!

That's the spirit!

In case you haven't, the dragon bash UI element in the top right expands if you click it. It tells you where it happens next, and if you click on the stampede event it zooms your map to q waypoint.

1) Stop using labels incorrectly. It's dumb, it makes people angry, it doesn't convince anyone of anything. 
---
2) You think everyone is a "SJW" because you get a lot of hate when you say it, but you're getting that hate because most people know that the term is now effectively meaningless, and they're mad that you're using effectively a slur (in your mind) to describe them. 
---
3) I didn't mean "you don't have permission to say SJW". I meant, "you shouldn't do that because there are negative consequences." You're a fool or a troll if you didn't understand that.

The twitch streamer, novagw2, has a similar concept as an emote on his channel. Its the left half of the DH symbol and the right half of the firebrand symbol pushed together

Here I am trying to do silly unimportant things like get geared and run raids, or leaning wvw...

Massively gets better as you approach Heavensward, starting from the last few quests of post ARR. The newest expansion's story, Shadowbringers, is not only good for an MMORPG. It's an amazing story, period.
---
Just take your time. Don't rush to end game like most people tend to want to do. It took me a good year to get through the base game because of how boring it was.

The fact I could barely follow what was going on in the video shows... I am not ready for pvp or wvw... sadness

I was going to comment this, I'm 14h late :l
---
You can, it's worth a shot.  They may send you another makeover kit for free :D
---
Rangers are odd ones atm in WvW.
---
They are not wanted in zergs because they are useless there - don't bring any significant boons, get reflected for days and outside the cooldown burst, they do little to no dmg sometimes compared to hammer rev.
---
Roaming? They are pretty great. Boonbeast is good dueler and sic em sniper is burster as seen above.
---
However as with most bursts, once the cooldowns been used up the dmg should fall a lot. So *in theory* if you Dodge and somehow kite/LoS you might survive and win.
---
But that's just theory. It doesn't really help to know ranger will be useless for 30s after you've died.
---
I just wanna say that I love your tat. For stuff like this, I don't personally love tats that look like they were done by robots. This looks like it's artistic, personal and cared for - sorta like the difference between those awesome pieces of handmade pottery and mass produced white plates at Target.
---
Oh, I know. It's unfortunate how many people get so worked up over something so small. Probably because they have nothing else to be passionate about so the smallest things set them off.  
---
/shrug. If people didn't expect there to be bugs with the event I don't know what to say.
---
Historically every farm producing more than about 20g per hour gets nerfed after a while. It will happen in Dragonfall as well. Fractals produce more as it is.
---
Furthermore, giving "barely" 50g more per day to everyone adds up to an absurd amount of gold flowing into the economy. Without adding corresponding sinks it will lead to everyone having bigger number in their wallet but the same or worse purchasing power.
---
Wtf that strange bird/toenail face doesn‘t look good. I would not like having these things run around in my game. There are enough furry-esque charrs.
---
Don‘t need that.
---
i pug T4's every day and when i play condi QB (which is often) i'm top DPS 9/10 times
---
The ideas I keep bringing up:
---
Echo mesmer with microphone mace and shouts
---
Poltergeist necro with sword and spirit weapons
---
Warden ranger with rifle and banners
---
Corsair warrior with offhand pistol and tricks
---
I would almost recommend you save up some gold for character slot then.
---
Deleting characters is not advisable. Unless it is there for like key farm or map complete farm....
---
I did the same many years ago. I didn't wanna play my necro so I deleted it. It would have been around 6 years old now.... 
---
Still kinda regret that I deleted it back then..
---
Try this [Daredevil build](https://youtu.be/JKmRQUACJf8) out, or plenty of the other builds featured on that channel.
---
Thats just impatience/poor research. We all knew the 3000 series was coming, and previous series will see price drops.
---
 I *See* You're a *Man of Culture*
---
I mean, if you complain all the time you are bound to complain about something that is supposed to be complained about at some point :p (not that changes in WvW have a great track record of being clean from having big to game breaking issue but still).
---
Be that as it may, OP does their own bit of deception by calling this a PSA when it is basically just their opinion of what is right and what is wrong.
---
Dude. No.
---
Just no.
---
I just finally crafted my spark of sentience. This shit took forever. Started from complete scratch. Would not recommend

can we all just agree that there needs to be a rival to masked roller F and its based on nil chaos, cause he seems to be the mount master
---
Not when they lie to me. I've helped plenty of raid trainings and I make raid trainings almost every week that always end with at least one kill.
---
But you lie to me? Screw you.
---
As a scrapper/tempest main in PvP/WvW I don't know what you are talking about. Soulbeast always die instantly without I'm even attacking them ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
You know your PC is not a potato when you can do this
---
I've had the misfortune of running into the exact scenario as in the OP where we get to artsari or Arkk and it becomes clear someone thought that they could carry their friends lack of experience.  It's just not a good time.  Honestly, I find CMs boring.  Fractals too...
---
Now do it again with the ui turned off pls.
---
So, when does the weekly dragon bash vendor resets, if not at weekly reset?
---
Ok, I didn't expect any consistency. But hey, I want those map currencies.
---
&gt;do you think making a post about it asking if anyone had an extra code would violate any of the subreddit's rules? 
---
&gt;Begging
---
&gt;Begging for items/currency/game codes is not allowed at all.
---
I will never get tired of these helicopters
---
Get the expansions, you’ll definitely want them, and they’ll give you several extra character slots.  Most of us consider the leveling in this game to just be the tutorial, the best is yet to come for you.
---
Jawgeous needs money.
---
If you actually took the time to read deeper into it instead of taking it at face value, you would see this isn't something that *only* happens on the raid LFG and tends to happen in other parts of the game.  Primarily fractals.
---
Your mom never told to to go out at night ??

Sounds like a hero point then. They're scattered around the world. And you're welcome.
---
I really like it! I love like the aesthetics of underwater things like corals and idk i just like it alot  :D!
---
Definitely craft the Clovers first, mystic forging them will give you plenty of materials, a few mystic coins and, obsidian shards. You can also take your time with the obsidian shards, since they're easy to get with karma or by farming the Silverwastes bandit chests. Also keep an eye out on the guild hall vendor and Ley-Energy Matter Converter and Karma Converter if you have them - some days they contain Large bags of obsidian with 10 shards in it. I wouldn't buy medium or single shards, though, not worth it.
---
Also work on your WvW gift of the battle track, it will give you a few more Clovers too. If you don't play WvW much, at least try to do a couple of dailies - the reward track from the potions adds up quickly.
---
Luckily you need Ascalonian dungeon tokens, which is the lowest level and the most popular dungeon still. Do the quick paths (P1, P3) every day and you'll have enough tokens and a nice pile of dust in no time.
---
Isn't Bitterfrost more of a dragonite ore farm? My holo was swimming in the stuff after farming winter berries for a while.
---
HoT was released in 2015. Do we still need to mind spoilers 4 years later?

And wow release schedule mebbe

I usually don't even reply in pvp. Who of us is rude to you?
---
&gt; Is this type of damage in pvp even possible?
---
In the hellhole that is post-PoF PvP, anything is possible :)
---
Remember, your gemstore purchases pay the sallary of the balance devs so they can play D&amp;D in the office for 3 months before doing random 50% buffs/nerfs to a bunch of specs on that 1 day they of work they squeeze into a quarter.
---
u can also reset ur own skills with the core swap button
---
I never said anything of the sort. Now you are just making shit up.
---
On builds like OP experienced it can hit for 3-4k at least.
---
I hope you don't mind if I take this as "inspiration" to revive my old sylvari engi. I really like the look of it. Btw, are the gloves still available?

Pact Copters: Hazard for pedestrians since 1325 AE
---
here's a few places i use to farm emp fragments:
---
- domain of kourna: farm caches and loot boxes. gives around 150-250 fragments per day.
---
- sandswept isles: farm difluorite crystal nodes. gives around 150-250 fragments per day.
---
- ley-energy matter converter: some times there is bag you can buy that gives 50.
---
hope this helps.
---
You're not very bright, are you?  It's for the people who use the LFG to get their runs, to fill in for groups when their static loses one or more players and the guild they are part of is silent.  It's telling people not to be deceptive in their advertisements.
---
It concerns the two where it matters.  Open world, WvW, and PvP don't have this problem and instead, have their own problems.  If you want to go off of what people are using, Open world LFGs on popular maps to farm (SW, HoT meta train, PoF meta train, Core meta train, and the occasional season 3 or 4 map meta.) Fractals and raids tend to only get active upon their reset plus a few hours.  With raids, the longer the week goes on, the more people who have their full clears so they're not going to bother putting up an LFG for anything raid related.  The other sections get more players because the rewards for the content resets daily instead of weekly.
---
Wasn't Kodasche dead long before, just to have a load of transfers to it, then have them abandon the server again?

Maby in GW3, which will also never happen probably.

properly functioning headwear on charr?

I’m jelly of you. This is how I felt back in 2012. I miss that feeling.

Im sorry you feel that way. I hope some day you will regain this feeling!
---
If only dual wielding incorporated attacks from both weapons wielded and not just a chain from the main-hand...
---
Exactly. At the start I had many complaints but as I played and got better in both PvP and WvW the build is easy to counter most times.  It comes as a shock when you get hit the first few times but once you adapt and learn to counter they're only end up making you a better player. The only stipulation is some people are just better players which I appreciate because it gives you something to strive towards.
---
Ahhhh, interesting! Thank you. Its honestly such a cool game and I hope this post will help others too to give try! Thanks for all the info!
---
Less so now that mounts are a thing.
---
I used to use it all the time in wvw to:
---
keep people where i wanted them in combat (negated by blocks and evades)
---
be able to chase them down when they run
---
(Negated by blocks and evades)
---
Be able to initiate unexpecting players
---
Be able to pull people off walls
---
(Now noone comes near wall edges due to learning and the shitshow that walls are when scourges are attacking)
---
So the one time it was most reliable, now has people sat on warclaw because it is a second health bar that cannot be cced.

Festivals are huge community events with special festival drops and prizes so come to the festival and really enjoy the fun!!
---
Dragonbash it’s called and it celebrates the 1st games victory! (Now it’s returned since we killed the big bad end guy from the living season BUT I don’t want to say to much because.. *spoilers*)
---
Needless to say.. Come to dragonbash!
---
Test your luck at Moa race betting (think gambling on horse races)
---
Test your skills at “Mount racing” (think.. Race track around the city type game)
---
Test your mettle at the Arena (you fight waves and waves of Holographic enemies)
---
Get cool drops.. unlock cool skins.. meet new players/people and cohort with your old friends!
---
Basically festivals in this game (same as original gw1) are community gatherings with fun “limited” events and prizes. This year you can get a cool holographic dragon themed helmet and backpack/wings set (as well as holographic versions of the precursor weapons) 
---
So come to the festival and just start having fun!
---
You won’t miss any core game or features but if you don’t come enjoy the party you will miss it ;)
---
The map is really weird optimized. Is like a map on top of another map. I get the branded palm trees occasionally but at Ice Flows boss the thing get out of hand. I presume this is the reason for graphic lag and freezes and shuttering and devs should do something about it.

Bad bad trip : [https://ibb.co/5Fvp2Xp](https://ibb.co/5Fvp2Xp)

Ahh HYPE now it sounds soo much cooler! Im defintively coming today to check it out!
---
That "something" is gonna plauge the game mode for the week it is here. And i shall be happen about that? 
---
Let's look at reddit like just the last month. How many of those events that was done for a week broke the whole game mode? Oh none? And yet people moaned about boss week, Skyscale, to little loot, too much loot, wrong loot, too long, too short....
---
Oh and the sky scale, wow ok takes to long, cost to much, to hard, to easy, to much grind, to much gems for skins, to many skins for gems, to ugly skins for one pack, just a remake, to be honest i don't even remember all of it but it was a month of endless moans and yet of it could still be played without breaking the game mode. 
---
But WvW god we moan so much because we get updates. They are broken as fuck but shut up and be great full.
---
Still surprised Gwen has nothing to say to you if you're a charr. With our record she'd be WAY more justified in chewing us out than she does with Rytlock.
---
On other news, because of surprise last-minute house renovations I am forced to leave a month early once again, so **CommanderYes is officially on hiatus**. Your boy Snargle will return in September!

They always make me stop in DR or whenever they are. But sometimes their macro can't handle all the notes and music sounds... bad and off the tempo. As a musican I have to say: more notes don't make music better.

&amp;#x200B;
---
I have to ask: why do you cover the nicknames?
---
have you heard of reflects?
---
Do you need to be a specific level to do these things and get cool stuff?
---
10 FPS max.
---
u/Cyekk may be consider this guy for your next draw? :)
---
Skills are slip for pve/PvP and all the boonbeast skills got nerfed slightly a few meta ago...
---
So you won’t be doing 100k dmg in PvP never ever lol. (Maybe in pve who knows you could be correct)
---
WOOW thats alot!
---
LOL yup just got my 12th legendary 2 weeks ago
---
"Now go buy some keys and test your luck OP." - Anet probably
---
GW2 won't make CPU's stand out more than they already do from normal benchmarks. Just have good single core performance and you're good in GW2.
---
I always meet the same people, dont know what game are yo playing tho
---
What damn! Grats!
---
Thanks it's really a great game i've been playing for over 5 years
---
This happened to me when I was trying to reach a meta champion after getting lost.
---
Lol, sure, believe what you want to.
---
Completely thought this was going to turn out to be a spoof or trick of some kind, not because Gw2 isn't awesome, just confused by genuine happiness and excitement. Don't lose that :)
---
I'm just starting a conversation about FPS numbers with new processors, I already have an i7-6700k that I routinely get 160 frames on at 1440p that I'm quite satisfied with, thanks for the concern though.
---
Nice try anet
---
If you want a hardcore challenge: 100% map completion; but:
---
* No mounts and glider.
---
* No map and mini map. You can speak to the scouts.
---
* No waypoints.
---
* If you die — you have to delete your character.
---
* You can use equipment ONLY from vendors, loot, rewards, crafting.
---
* No trading post and bank.
---
Or another: Reach 80lvl, but:
---
* No killing (only exeption is initial event after creating your character).
---
* No instant exp/lvl boosters.
---
* You can earn experience by exploration, gathering, crafting, hearts (but remember: no killing, u have to be peaceful).
---
* If you die — delete character. YOLO.
---
* No map and mini map.
---
* No TP or Bank.
---
* Eq only from vendors, crafting, loot (chests in minidungeons).
---
Great to see someone having fun fresh experience with the game!
---
Hearts in gw2 are there to guide you, so that you know you're in the right area doing things. They aren't necessary for you to complete, but if do it if you want to. If you feel like it's time to move on, by all means do, they will always be there and you can often outlevel them. They are also a solo contribution thing. A major aspect of the game is dynamic events, where you and other players contribute towards a certain goal. You usually get a good chunk of exp from it along with some loot.
---
Just a small note, when wielding two weapons, skill 3 being unique to the weapon combo is a unique feature of thief, called dual wield. With all other classes, main hand controls 1-3 and off hand controls 4 and 5. Elementalist's Weaver elite spec has a similar function, but it's for dual elements instead of weapons.
---
In Quensdale there is a event were the bandit poison the water which leads to people being poinsoned some were else in the region and the farmes is pooring out poison water on their fields instead of pure water. To stop this you have to go to the area where this happen and kill the bandits and fix the water. It is a small thing that goes unnotices and many people don't even connect the dots why people are poisoned on the other side of the map, but i always loved those sort of events.
---
Just fyi, if you decide to buy the expansions make sure to check out if one of the official retailers has it cheaper! Dlgamer usually has some sort of discount (currently only 5%, it goes up to 50% discount for both expansions).
---
It's like you glazed over the first word I said.......
---
&gt; Personally
---
Also FYI, amount of xunlai needed can't even be compared to the amount of shit skyscale/vision needed. 
---
If you're just talking about the spark, that's a pretty disproportionate comparison.
---
What they mean is that your auto attack just uses one weapon while the other hand just kinda hangs there
---
I still have exalted mask flashbacks... *shivers*
---
Even if you would not be able to complete everything, there is like 99% chance that the festival will return next year by this time. Anyways, this year there is still 8 days left.
---
PS: for the races, you can rent a mount and try it out, either raptor or roller beetle. Same on some maps, there are races, you can rent a roller beetle there as well. If you dismount, you have to talk to the rent guy again, but either way, it is great way how to get initial feel of mounts in this game. They are great!
---
I still cannot believe this dude!!! you helped me out soo much!!! THANK YOUUU man im still in shock ty man wtf i cant believe it!!
---
I would still find human race as the only appealing choise in this particular game
---
Should we tell them about the mount aswell? And the new team Anet has for WvW along with teams for other areas of the game? 
---
I'm thinking we let them stew
---
because, in all honestly, that's what offhand weapons should do. attacking with both weapons together makes no sense, as well as using a offhand weapon as it were a main hand.
---
So, with PoF you get a lv80 boost item. Most people would tell you to Not use this boost as the leveling up in Gw2 is both quite fun as well as educational.
---
But! There are, in my opinion 2 exceptions.
---
1. Use it after lv50 or 60 to boost the last few levels (they can get sorta tiresome)
---
2. Use it to unlock the first mount (Raptor) on all your characters.
---
Since you now own Path of Fire you have the ability to unlock Mounts for your account. Once a mount is unlocked ALL your characters can use the mount, even your level 1 characters.
---
To unlock mounts you have to be lv80 and do the first Path of Fire mission.
---
--------------
---
Sooo. IF you feel you really want to unlock a Raptor for all your chars directly you Can do that in like 40 minutes of gameplay.
---
This would be my recommended way of doing it.
---
1. Create a new character. Pick a class you dont intend to play directly, but one that you think you probably want a lv80 of later.
---
2. Use the lv80 boost on this new character
---
3. Activate Path of Fire story and go do the first 2 instances of Path of FIre (Raptor is now unlocked for all your chars.)
---
4. Go back to playing and leveling your regular character and just let your lv80 character sit and collect dust for a few weeks.
---
---------
---
Note: The original Core zones of the game were created literary Years before mounts were even a thing, they are not really designed for mounts and as such you may miss out on some of the experience by the speedy zooms you will do on a raptor.
---
Note2: By doing the first part of the PoF mission you will undoubtedly run into some spoilers, most of them wont make much sense to you right now anyway but I know people are often recommended to turn off sound fully while playing this mission, in order to reduce the amount of spoilers (you cant hear the characters talk about what is happening)
---
Idk, predator is pretty awesome
---
I'd level twenty Largos before even considering a Tengu, and I still have no real desire to play a Largo...
---
And don't get me started on the Kodans. I seriously keep forgetting the borebears are even in the game. :P
---
The fastest way to get gold and have fun?
---
Have a job that you like and pays well. Do some overtime. Done. It really cannot be beaten in-game, and will last post-GW2.
---
I actually remember this being brought up by anet before launch, that they made it so top and bottom animate separately so that you could move and attack freely. Unfortunately that means animations turn out just as you describe.
---
A large portion of players will hop into wvw because of the event only. And even many of the regulars are "autopiloting". They wouldn't even notice if enemies use the same skills 25 times over regardless of cooldowns. 
---
The exact same as in golem week and other wvw glitches. Most players dont realise what is going on and cant tell the difference between regular gameplay and game breaking exploits.
---
&gt; I do not recommend trying to use browser and game client in same time.
---
That very much depends on the web sites you browse to.
---
Event is in wvw, they wont fix it.
---
The sic em glass build is also the perma prot boonbeast build is it?
---
Most of these benchmarks are synthetic (they are stress tests in a vacuum instead of real time gaming) and each software interacts very differently with each cpu architecture making the results confusing if not chaotic. You could test in 10 different software and get 10 different results. Just wait untl live benchmarks are on yt with actual gaming footage and fps comparisons.
---
Although the 3600 is indeed very strong and could possibly be even with 9900k in multi threaded performance....to assume that it has higher single thread performance than the most expensive mainstream cpu that comes overclocked at 5ghz, consumes power like a mofo and u can cook potatoes on it without strong cooling system...is absurd.
---
I love how the skyscale is casually eating the wall.
---
So whatever you do, dont use the mail in a way that is linked to your account.
---
correction, how must games do it\*
---
gw2 treats offhand weapons as companion weapons  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companion\_weapon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companion_weapon)  only they do occasionally other things than parry or block
---
 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrying\_dagger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrying_dagger)  as well
---
obviously this is a world of magic so they don't have to follow realism at all, but i find much more intresting using offhands weapons in games for "opportunity attacks" rather them being ragdolled as second tier weapons.
---
Same with me! Started a few weeks ago and I am enjoying the game A LOT. Possibly the best MMORPG I ever played.
---
I'm curious how it'll look when the hair grows back.
---
Anet is not aware of complaints. 
---
They made an arena in eotm and made it ... too small and added a bunch of water with zero visibility for aoes. At least Ben listened to feedback and fixed that after. 
---
Somehow they didnt get the feedback from their previous attempts, and never realised how badly people hate water in wvw.
---
They just tell some artist to design something. Highly doubt they even consider the functionality of their design.
---
and you keep believing that this post on reddit will change anyones behaviour on lfg
---
Alter Mann
---
That meme has kinda died since they haven't touched necro axe since 2017.
---
Nobody plays GW2 for attack animations. IMO the only MMOs I've played with good animations are FF14 and TERA, and I've also played ESO and WoW (which also have terrible animations).
---
I never said you should be happy about it. I just disagreed with the sentence about "Anet not caring about WvW". If it breaks the game it should be taken out, simple. They did stuff like that in raid content already (I remember Xera being blocked for over a week).
---
For the day? That's rather optimistic.
---
I actually really like GW2s animations while disliking the Asian MMOs animations. FFXIV feels waaaay over the top, BLM animations actually hurt my eyes.
---
I just remember having problems with them when they were introduced as they were tied to content that i rarely played but right now you can literally get them (same with the other 2) literally under every stone.
---
Imagine seriously thinking wvw isnt neglected.
---
Jeez all this info thank you soo much!
---
New team for wvw? Do tell ;)
---
oh shit i’m a rev main and i don’t know this, gotta check it out after work
---
Maybe if you play a spellcaster, that makes sense. But melee animations in GW2 are absolute balls.
---
Yeah we did, GW1s balance was uncontrollable, engine was outdated and ANet couldn't do what they wanted with the game anymore.
---
Raided in wotlk, Legion, ESO, Tera and Neverwinter and I can confirm that this raiding community is the most elitist out of them and I can also confirm that the raids I've done in GW2 were the one of the easiest I've done so far making their elitism comically misplaced.
---
Which skill is ult? I main holo and I'm wracking my brain trying to work it out.
---
That's certainly the case most of the time with open world PvE.  Also stay away from toughness and vitality and focus more on damage stats. The trick of this game is to kill faster, not tank longer.  I know it goes against what you probably think, but that's what experience has taught most of us.
---
I will try to find it later if I remember. Think there was a blog post?
---
I still haven't even been to wing 6 sadly. Don't have the time anymore to keep up with a well organized raid group.
---
"Toi" was a "to" that wanted to overdo it xD
---
Just a typo.
---
White weapons are a class of weapons that consist of non firearm, non explosive weapons.
---
I am not sure this term exists in english, now that i think about it? I used it often.
---
Practice, practice, practice. Your gear is bad but most of the difference will come from learning how to move and how your class works. That's all to it.
---
Of the systems team? That was only reorganisation of people that were already working on this stuff, and did not allocate any extra resources. If it's something else feel free to link.
---
Ahhh, I might have misunderstood which is likely. If I do find anything I'll link it, highly probable imma idiot
---
Apparently it exists in some languages, but English uses "cold weapons" instead. I guess melee is the best?
---
Anyway, let's keep realism out of this, what game do you think does weapons best?
---
Nothing not to look forward too. Dungeons at level 80 are for everyone (and lower levels too) because they are pretty much out dated and people are stronger nowadays than before.  
---
Fractals have 100 levels to go up through and slowly and somewhat easily you go up the ranks and things get tougher (and more rewardable). T1 can be done by pretty much any group of 5 and teach you the mechanics of each map. All the way to T4 where you kinda do need some sort of (meta?-) coordination with usually a healer and a supporter.  
---
And if you get into a guild that does raiding weekly and has a training group you'll get the hang of it at your pace. There are even dedicated training guilds I think.
---
Welcome to NoendgameWars2! IMO combat is superior to every single MMO out there, very enjoyable (this is why I can't enjoy any other MMO). But for open world, you only need to press 1 and afk, which wouldn't be a bad thing (in fact I like open world) if the developers wouldn't toss raids into the garbage with "challenge modes" which can be cleared by pros in the first minute it is out. (You can downvote me, I collect them. I might even get a title for it.)
---
One of my biggest desires as well I even have reserved for tengu: herald , soulbeast and scourge
---
Yeah I know im in denial I guess
---
Ok! My understanding is that most auto-attacks cannot be prevented, and moving is largely for avoiding AoE; just from this thread I'm learning that's probably wrong! Are there any main pointers for improving movement?
---
It definitely is a joke weapon of the same ilk as quip or moot. Whether that's good or bad thing is entirely down to personal taste.
---
It's detailed, sure, but come on. It's a gun that looks like a mini pirate ship with sails. It's not something most could take seriously.
---
Ok so gear-wise the expansions are mostly balanced assuming you have exotic gear which is generally used as the baseline power level for level 80 characters. Since you sound like a fairly new player the easiest/fastest way to get some is almost certainly to buy some given that you likely don't have stores of karma or other currencies. Being a holosmith you should search for "Nika's" on the trading post for a full set of level 80 exotic medium armour with berserker's stats. 
---
If I remember I'll update this with more information about how the gear system works but in a bit of a rush right now.
---
And thus the two dagger rogue defeated jormag only using one hand. "I don't know how to use my left hand more than twice every second, so I killed him with my right spam". His legend will be sing in hoelbrak hall till the end of times.
---
Ok, thank you! I have a fair amount of currencies, I believe, as I haven't spent any of it. Ok, will do!
---
yea cuz in pvp you need to be able to see the timer of really important buffs like endure pain and berserker stance and many more. For most players they just glance up at the health bar u see a couple boons and then the important skill duration after. If you stack enough of these buffs it can make it take two rows of buffs the location of the buffs shift around, Making these important skills that shift the side of pvp fight really aids to keep track off. I
---
Well at least im better than some kid who cries that "raiders are toxic" but yes go back to your Teq farm. I hear the content is very engaging and rewarding
---
Agreed, but I also find that there is almost no group for people below 250Li. I do not really care as I have around 300, but it really make me sick to see everyone asking for 250Li on escort or VG.
---
Back in time when I was raiding a lot (very long time ago), I would have never asked for more than 100 on VG... And for Xera, Mathias and Deimos (who was the last boss at that time) I usually asked for 150Lis ! (200 on my bad days)
---
It is normal to want experimented people, but the community is really turning elitist now, and new players really struggles to find a group.
---
I thought about getting that..but then I realized I would be a guy asking for a butterfly tattoo
---
Easiest? maybe, but it still requires a Gift of desert mastery which many people didn't care about until now because using a gift of maguuma mastery was easier/faster for legendary weapons. Getting 250 funerary incenses was no joke and even now that they are more afordable it could mean quite a lot of grind if you are a raider that has neglected other PoF core map content.
---
Found the Whispers agent.
---
I, myself, would love to play as a Kodan. Even if a Kodan in Maguuma Jungle seems pitiful.
---
It does sound like OP put in minimal effort to find a group to raid with based on his experience. I've been in and out of different statics, and my experience has been positive. If you apply to the guild and have the skill, which OP says he has, there shouldn't be a problem. Trial runs are common for a reason when you join a new group. 
---
I suggest browsing the subreddit linked above, checking out the official GW2 forums, or joining one of the Discord serves that organizes raids for people of all levels.
---
Oh and the cheapest sword to buy with berserker's stats currently is "Bonetti's Rapier"
---
Wait a goddamn minute...  is that [Vivi](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Vivi_Ornitier) cosplay??
---
Man, reading this makes me want to play again.  The first expansion just burned me out so badly, but I keep  hearing good things about current expansion and this guys enthusiasm is contagious.
---
Glad to hear you're enjoying the game man, it's well worth every hour of time you put into it and yes... the community is pretty damn awesome also.
---
Only true only if you already have the skyscale.
---
If someone joined the game today and purchased both LS3 and LS4 completing Aurora would be faster than Vision, but i can agree that it's more viable to go for Vision since you will probably want to get your skyscale.
---
You are the WEAKEST link!
---
I may well do, that may have slipped my mind, sorry! Either way, I'll look into it, thanks!
---
its the whales triggered by what you're saying.
---
Ouch. And yes, we should have the achievement on copters.
---
I used to have this problem. I went over to Metabattle and picked a high rated open world build for my profession. I didn't follow the rotation but it helped me pick gear, traits, and runes. All that together and now I rarely, if ever, have trouble.
---
If you want, i can offer you to join our guild. We are still very small, though very helpful and give a familial atmosphere :)
---
You seem really engaged to the game, thats exactly what we look for.
---
We are also a very open minded and international community. And we take really care to uphold these values and be friendly to each other.
---
You can send me a DM if you want.
---
How many years have you been playing the game?
---
You are just unlucky.
---
In any case if you just want to do map completions go for the dragonfall map on every character. You can do a map completion in just a few minutes assuming you already got your skyscale since there are no hearts to complete. Also the first map of LS3 (whatever it was called) is also a good choice since it doesn't have hearts either.
---
Are we pretending the Charr were these benevolent creatures picking flowers until the humans came? lmao
---
They were warmongering cannibalistic savages in open war with everyone around them (including Dwarves and Forgotten) then got their asses kicked by humans and now play the victim. Later they genocided entire Ascalon, Orr, and almost Kryta too and in GW2 we're supposed to feel sorry for them? Good joke.
---
Much of the GW1 lore was built around Charr being the villains, Anet has set up thusands of years of conflict and then GW2 rolls around, end the war in 1 fell swoop and now we're friends hurray. God I hate the stupid dragon plot and how the entire world was reshaped around it, discarding some of the pillars of the entire lore.
---
Just a random ghost charr
---
Where did I write I weren't being accepted into groups?
---
The second head start released. 8/28/12. I think it was? Up until about  7 months ago. I'll hop in every other week or so for an hour then log off tho.
---
Not exactly, but they still have very high Protection uptime and sustain due to Wilderness Survival traits. 
---
Sicem also usually allow one flex utility so I can imagine people running Dolyak Stance in that slot and basically be almost a boonbeast, except they delete yur health hard.
---
Sure, u want to be democratic, go ahead and let people get on your head and rule, meanwhile I do what I want and actually clear the content. In my squad you obey my rules or u fuck off. Because I'm 100% sure that my 100Li colleague is better than average 500Li pug because I can actually communicate with him. Not even mentioning that most of the pugs fake their Li these days.
---
Especially these days
---
At this point I’d settle for a tonic, which we don’t even have yet :&lt;
---
Check TP prices: usually more profitable to buy T4 mats with laurels, sell, and purchase T6. GW2 efficiency will give you the best tier (3 or 4).
---
Can we make Anet aware of unskippable dialogues in Rain wing 7? Staring at the gate after opening the gate for whole 2 min is not fun. Why are they keep doing this every wing?
---
Ok great! I'll give that a look, thanks!
---
We can only hope for a rifle spec if we get a next expac!
---
You said you weren't being accepted by the raiding community and were being shunned, I guess I incorrectly assumed this was referring to being accepted into groups.
---
&gt; engine was outdated
---
*Insert a "bUt Gw2 UsE tHe SaMe EnGiNe!1!!" comment here.*
---
until you actually make your character look good
---
I do not recognize those skins.
---
i'm glad there's no achivement though. It seems to be too rng to get.
---
I think you're conditioned to assume that every story must have an obvious "good guy" and and equally obvious "bad guy". This is not the case. 
---
In Guild Wars, we had the perspective of the Ascalonians, who were firmly behind the idea that Ascalon was rightfully theirs. They never saw themselves as villains and thought of themselves as righteous heroes, when they went on expeditions to hunt charr, in order to keep their frontiers secure.
---
Meanwhile, the charr were always determined to regain what they had lost in a similar manner to the Reconquista, a process that took many wars and around 770 years. The human charr conflict lasted twice that amount, which leaves a lot of time to build enmity.
---
The conflict ended, the charr were propped up by none other than Abaddon, so they conquered the land in a similar manner to how humans conquered Tyria in the first place. The principles of war and conquest are ancient and the Idea that conquest is somehow "wrong" is a very recent one. One, I suspect, that will not stand the test of time.
---
there is no direct correlation but there is one
---
In the map [Gendarran Fields](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gendarran_Fields) where the Centaurs  disturb the residence of the land, [Nebo Terrace](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Nebo_Terrace) is a town where the Centaurs assault, and if they win, &gt;!they capture the NPCs and you lose access to the services in the town. In this case you need to head north of the map and rescue them from the Centaurs. :D!&lt; 
---
[Prevent the centaurs from capturing Nebo Terrace](Prevent the centaurs from capturing Nebo Terrace) is the climax of the Meta Event chain of Gendarran Fields and is my sibling's favourite meta event. ps: this event worth a World Boss fight IMO.  :P
---
Each map has their own stories xD
---
&gt;  ANET promised us before the game came out and after the game came out.
---
Ehh.. what the hell are you talking about? Anet never promised anything like that. Neither before release nor after. 
---
It's even the opposite, they said that it's very unlikely and that they don't plan to bring a new playable race, because it's not worth it (much work, no content for players). 
---
Do you have any official statements of these "promises"?
---
The 3700x and 3900x are basically sold out instantly upon release. You might have to wait quite a while (1+ weeks) before getting any answer to your question.
---
Close ranged auto attacks can be avoided if you move around smartly. Some monsters also have slower autos while others are harder to avoid. Moving around will also help you to avoid some of the big aoes instead of only relying on dodges (so you can save them for the harder stuff to dodge). Knowing when to use defensive skills and when to attack also makes the difference. And this comes from practice with your class and observing the monsters.
---
OMEGALUL, yup not salty at all :)
---
They are like fungus that naturally grow in your bag if you don't clean often
---
Reporting wont do jack shit and even if they do somehow get banned it ll be a 3 day suspension.
---
There isnt even a category for exploits.
---
Good try Anet... No way someone would be so excited by spending 10m in starting zone
---
No one was banned during the golem week event when golems were able to use Ice Bows, Fiery Greatsword or when you could retain the golem buff ( significant damage increase ) while not in a golem and none of those things were intended.  
---
No one was banned when Guardian Symbols were bugged and could melt objective gates in 0.1 seconds if enough Guardians were stacked together.  
---
No one was banned when Necromancers Signet of Vampirism was bugged and could do the same as what Guardian Symbols did.  
---
No one was banned when the west inner gate of Stonemist Castle had a spot you could bypass allowing you to skip the inner gate.  
---
No one was banned when Engineer's Grenade Barrage multi-hit and did 50k+ damage in a single attack.  
---
No one was banned when Gunflame double proc'd.  
---
Should I continue? No one's going to get banned for something that's the fault of ANet. It's a temporary event and will be a temporary problem. Bugs can be fun if you have a sense of humor about it. Just enjoy the absurdity of having pseudo-limitless skill casts.
---
Wow I didn't know that until you mentioned (or I'm just simply forgetful xD) 
---
I don't go Queensdale much.
---
&gt; I think you're conditioned to assume that every story must have an obvious "good guy" and and equally obvious "bad guy". This is not the case.
---
I agree!
---
Do you know what the problem is with GW2's portrayal of the conflict?
---
They've painted this story rather black and white in GW1, then instead of making it grey in GW2, they've painted it just as black and white except reversed who's supposed to be the definitive good guy without changing anything else about these factions. They basically go "well you know, mass genocide is actually completely fine if you hate the other side hard enough - except if you're human, then you're just supposed to accept it happen to you then move on"
---
People always say this, but I've never once seen it.
---
I only have LI as KP, as I donate KP to my guild for us to make jumping puzzles and statues. I just broke 200 LI and that's the only thing I ping. Shit, yesterday I joined a W4 as a fucking condi thief and didn't get kicked.
---
I'm my experience, people will give low KP or odd builds a chance more often than not. You will probably have to prove yourself more if you join as something stupid like a Condi thief or ping low KP, but you hardly need to run a lot of these bosses more than a couple times to know the fight really well.
---
I was doing daily CM before, because you can have extra rewards in it. What I was looking for was holodancers for guild decoration :) Additionally, it is funnier to do CM as they are more challenging, but this also depend on your group...
---
At least you didn't got hit by Madam Charrbara! :P
---
Good thing you understood what I wrote :) what I said is that whatever Anet does the community will feel that they are being neglected. Although in the past few months WvW got more content (Warclaw)/events that it did in last 3 years. Ofc that if you compare with other game modes, PvP is even in a worse state than WvW. And PVE gets the most attention because it is the one with the biggest community...
---
Don't get me wrong, I wish they would revamp the whole system because it is not sustainable at the moment, when the only thing keeping the game mode alive are the WvW guilds but you can't be that oblivious to the fact that stuff is happening...
---
They seem rather unexciting - which weapon specifically caught your eye, or are you just trying to completely fill your wardrobe?
---
Maybe I didn’t meet her. Still enjoy running into the guild members from time to time.
---
It doesn't even need to be call of the wild, just entering beast mode makes attacks unlockable for 5sec.
---
I personally love Ranger, Necro &amp; Warrior. You have multiple slots, make a few characters and see what suits your playstyle. You can also click the level 80 boost to try a character at level 80 and then talk to the NPC it sends you to in order to cancel the level 80 boost and not consume it. 
---
The voice acting through the personal story is decent, the story itself can be dull until you get to the expansions. Also note the choices you make during character creation change how your level 1-30 story plays out. My favorite personal story line is the norn blacked out at a moot story. I created a norn just to do that story it was great. 
---
Enjoy the game!

Can we get a Commander relaxing on a beach chair getting a non-tan as a hiatus pic?
---
Death magic is actually great for open world if you run a minion build, as minions without it are very weak. Fact is, even with blood magic and death magic, open world mobs die to one reaper shroud 4 most of the time if you're in zerker gear, and the tankiness means you can just wander into the middle of a group of mordrem or chak and spin2win without dying. Would I ever bring this build into pvp or raids? Hell no, it's useless there. But is it my favorite build to do open world stuff with? Yes, by a large margin.
---
Can't it be faded salmon color instead? Maybe winterberry?
---
*The reason you did not see this game* 
---
In my case, it is because ***it is not in Steam.*** 
---
A lot of people around me rely on Steam and especially oral transmission to know that a game is good.
---
Skill 3 changing based on what main AND offhand you have currently equipped is actually unique to thieves. On the other hand, each class plays different from each other and has different playstyles they go into. Wait until you go into traits (called specializations, you can equip a new line at 21, 45, and 71 iirc) to change how you play the class, then ELITE specializations at level 80 (if you have either one of the xpacs) to REALLY change how you play your class.

Join a Discord Training Community. People who cry about Raiding not being inclusive enough never joined one.

You need nothing but ascended weapons, which are available via collections, and trinkets, which you get in Fractals, wvw or LS, a bare bone rotation and the willpower to listen to a friendly commander.

If they can swing the great swords in this game they can swing 2 daggers or axes with little to no effort lol.

Which dyes did you use?

Ok, I'll give that a go! I still have a lot to explore, and frankly, was one of my favourite parts of the game! Thanks for the advice

\*I know not everybody doing it, but still

I did not? I clicked post and nothing more but it never became visible. Does this reddit have a karma limit now I'm unaware of?
---
That's brilliant
---
Kinda do have a few scythes allready.

I think when the deep sea dragon comes out they should mabye make some of the aquatic weapons avaible on land to mabye. Alot we could do with a spear.

Haha, same! The moment I saw it I knew I had to try, always liked the Faerie dragon &lt;:

Maroon for the body, Redemption for the belly (though Harvest Gold could also work, it's darker though), Green Apple for the wings (iffy on this one, but it's the best I could get since they do have a green'ish tint) and Maroon again for the other part of the wings and horns
---
So without all the text, Maroon/Redemption/Green Apple/Maroon
---
Totally normal and legit....just like CoR from rev hitting 20k+ every 4 sec. After all these months idk if anet dont care or can't fix it.
---
With all the content that has come out and given that it was a holiday weekend I highly doubt they are sitting on their arses and don't care.
---
Yes its annoying and yes it should be discussed but lets keep some perspective.
---
Thank you!
---
Lmao if only
---
Its free just download it and try it out jeez.
---
I don't have this kind of fps 😓
---
&gt; Are we pretending the Charr were these benevolent creatures picking flowers until the humans came? lmao
---
This is the same logic people use to dismiss how Native Americans were displaced, by calling them violent savages who had it coming anyway.
---
It's an extremely gross line of thinking and you should reconsider how you regard other peoples.
---
&gt;Later they genocided entire Ascalon, Orr, and almost Kryta too
---
You mean two human kings literally genocided their own people just to spite the charr?
---
you can open and download, is more big
---
I’ve been thinking the same thing for so long now. At least I’m not alone lol
---
&gt; I love that you have these triangles on the map, and you have to do PARCOUR?
---
Wait until lil charr here gets into Jumping puzzles.
---
Then wait until he eventually hit Chalice of Tears.
---
I thought for a second this was about the revenant swords, which would be nice too.
---
when you can go through massive ass corridors with nothing in your way? sure
---
Those are two hard classes for open world survival.
---
For Guardian, your only option is to kill things in the blink of an eye. I run zeal, radiance, virtues open world for max solo DPS using Save Yourselves to give me all boons in a burst.
---
Almost nothing survives scepter 2 and then greatsword 2, if that makes sense. Then I do some kiting, running around, dodging, etc. The Litany of Wrath heal helps a lot-- gives you more time you can do DPS while getting hit.
---
Guardian is now my open world main in full zerker gear.
---
Papa bless
---
I feel like we shoulda got kodan instead of norn. Not that I have anything against norn, but I'd rather have "big bear" aesthetic over "big human"
---
Really verdant brink seems like the best place to farm fragments from airship cargo
---
I do enjoy your deeper comics but this comedy is what I signed up for!
---
Assnet wanted this type of community in their game. They created the environment and dropped dungeons for this garbage. You got scammed into buying trash my friend.
---
How did you not see it, easy Anet sucks at promotion.  Unless you played the first game it was highly unlikely that you knew it was even coming out.  They did some really bad promotions at the start and then kind of fizzled out over the years.  They have slowly started to roll out more PR but nothing close to other games.
---
GW2's combat is vastly different from other MMO's though, and that's the point of the training - to learn the specific mechanics of the fight. It'd be worth it to join a training run until you know the mechanics so you aren't a drag to your team when you join a kill group.
---
I'd suggest that you largely ignore the people going nuts about berserker. Yes, Berserker armor is good, but as someone who's just starting out, try and get Marauder armor. You can craft it, can get it from the Heart of Thorns story, and *might* be able to get it from stat-selectable items now that they've reworked how that goes (I haven't played a ton recently). It might require that you own HoT though, and it's not clear from your post that you do. 
---
Marauder mixes damage stats with Vitality, increasing your health pool and still allowing you to hit hard. It's good enough to get you through any end-game content you care to do at this point, and it makes the game *so* much more fun and forgiving. I have pretty much full marauder armor and a bunch of berserker trinkets on my power Holosmith, and it's a ton of fun. 
---
Berserker armor is the endgame choice, but it has a lower skill floor than Marauder, so it does require you to git gud.
---
Tbh water combat is not *bad*, it's less refined  than ground combat. Mainly due to the fact that movement is cranky and a lot of GW2 combat is movement rather than equipment and grinded stats. So at the end of the game you feel a difference in gameplay.
---
If you actually compare underwater combat to other games underwater, if even any... We're in an amazing shape.
---
Also watergate in lake and green keep are always a budget/ unnexpected way in.
---
I see, thanks.  
---
  
---
I created my guardian hoping that it's a good tanky still bursty class for open world :D  
---
What could've been a better choice in your opinion?
---
&gt;250 Li = mastery? IDK what that means
---
Can you show your Spirit Shards on gw2effi page?
---
because you can compare 3 button macro rotation, 1 time buffing up for 20+ mins on each buff and then standing 30m away casting shit with occational moving and stats which let you auto block / dodge to the gw2 combat system where all of the named above is not in the game.
---
I dont consider an event that runs once and has game breaking exploits to be a success. If they fix these issues BEFORE the end of the event, itll be progress compared to previous events with the exact same issues.
---
Instead the event will be another week of exploiting and gamebreaking issues that will confirm, as usual, that wvwers should know better than to trust anet.
---
Not gonna lie, 95% of the players I see, are really trying to be either mega anime badass or the cutest anime waifu princess, and you know.. I just sigh and move on about my business
---
I've had art commissioned of mien for years now.
---
just do dungeons and fractals
---
I was confused at first. I thought this was a D&amp;D post where they're called Kenku and they *are* playable.
---
Oh trust me, the people who know what HoMM 3 is, know what HoMM 3 stands for :)
---
I still dont know what my underwater skills do and i have  played since release
---
is... i sthat a 3% return rate in Gold value?
---
They were basically the Hitler race prior to GW2 lol.
---
The Charr circlejerk is so strange considering that they're literally the least popular race. I wonder if this isn't some kind of reddit-exclusive hipster furry circlejerk vocal minority.
---
I don't even have lots of skins and dyes. I'm a regular warrior... But if you ask, I would love a cute anime character.
---
it looks like it targeted that tide pool
---
but holly shit why can it even do that o.0
---
Yes, it is hidden but still moving across your screen. You can scroll your inventory with it, zoom in/out minimap etc. Just like I demonstrated it in the video.
---
I really appreciate the answer ;&gt;
---
Did you do any of the maths to determine if the expected value is the same as the wiki? Seems like they're still not worth opening.
---
&gt; they'd look for people with "100cm"
---
I have never seen someone ask for fractal stuff in raids
---
&gt; Daimos (D**e**imos) is considered one of the hardest
---
Who says that?
---
Yup, that's how I noticed it first time. Couldn't understand why it's zoomed out.  
---
Sometimes I put a marker in fractals, then look at the minimap - can't see anything cuz it's zoomed out.
---
Do you have the HoT expansion too or just PoF ?
---
Oh, you have soooooooo much more to discover my friend. This game is HUGE. Enjoy.
---
I did kind of a TL;DR, so I might have missed the info... where are you from?
---
I dont believe you. Fractals up to 100 didnt exist before HoT. And when they first went up to 100 people continuously abused the system for 0 gameplay reward farming. I.e. triple swamp being the most common lfg / pug strat, often with bugging mosman.
---
After that they moved to minionmaster necro to autopilot through more fractals because they didnt want to learn the fractals / class. Neither of these were "elitist" strats.
---
Then cms further divided players in terms of skill, and pugs in non cm t4s were far worse than people pugging fractal 50 pre HoT.
---
You dont need a chrono. But as long as a large part of the community insists on minimal gameplay, it's no suprise people who dont adhere to this philosophy try to find similar minded players. And it's also no suprise minimal effort players eventually notice how easy stuff gets if they get more efficient groups.
---
Yep. Almost certain I've never seen it before, as all entities are marked with a crosshair on my end... 
---
I take it that's a bug? Im positive that Noone marked them.
---
super out of nowhere ;-; so weird
---
Lol if you think this dudes some schmuck you must be a noob or a filthy casual and if your a filthy casual go back to open world and continue to pressing 1.
---
Honestly this game has no business being free to play.
---
A few more tips:
---
1. To check to see if you, by chance, got a super in-demand piece of loot, just right click it and pick SELL AT AUCTION. It wont immediately sell it, but it will automatically price-check it againt all buyers who want it now. From there, you could click SELL-NOW, and end up with a ton of ez silver/gold.
---
2. Whatever loot isnt worth keeping, just salvage it and comsume its Luck Essence (to permanently raise you account Magic % find).
---
3. For a free +20% EXP buff, you should always be under the effects of a Food Buff. Heres how: There are 2 types (an Apple Icon buff, and a Wrench Icon buff, you can be under the effects of both at once). Just go to the auction house, and buy like 200 blueberry tarts food (or whatever the cheapest +10%EXP food is-- could be apple pie), and also buy like 200 Centaur-killing-juice (idk what its actually called, but they cust like 3 copper), and ensurebthat your always under the effect of both, for a sweet +20% EXP boost that literally cost copper.
---
A reaper necro is a pretty good choice if you want something that is quite tanky with good damage. For defense they have the highest base hp alongside the warrior and the shroud skill acts like second hp bar for when things get real dangerous. On top of that, they also have multiple life steal traits to nullify some of the weaker hits you take.
---
For damage, the greatsword and the axe work really well together and both of them provide vulnerability for that extra damage boost. Also if you want to really burst something down quickly, you can just pop into your shroud and use the 4 skill. Its basically and i win button for open world enemies.
---
By not being delusionally disconnected. Talking to other people or Google or looking at your own performance or ... Its genuinely not difficult.
---
The issue is most players wont do any of these. Can you get one of these builds? Nope you're toxic for implying they arent amazing. They'd rather flame you than look at another build.
---
I cant just join a 200 li w1-w7 clear after my daily teq with no experience? Raiders so elitist ! Meanwhile tons of players select gear and utilities randomly and never reflect on what they do.
---
If you play for hundreds of hours and you consistently interrupt your own skills because you dont know how their casts work then there's nothing anet can do. Just lost caused tbh.
---
I agree making everything else trivially easy makes things worse, but no you dont need to spoon feed people basics because they refuse to do more than the bare minimum.
---
i mean, a few tries and it gets very useful. I tend to run into water if i'm losing a fight in WvW because i can usually outmaneuver me opponent in water. Eles have a shitton of movement skills, such as opening a barrier that pushes you backwards, throwing a sphere that will in time teleport you to it, forcing enemies to rise or sink, etc etc.
---
It's pretty interesting while clanky, and knowing the skill where you opponent does not is what makes you win that fight.
---
It’s just not the same :(
---
GW2 also has many europeans playing it who don't speak english at all. Those people often have their own native forum, discord or teamspeak server.
---
That's a lie
---

You get one for each raid boss you kill, and are used by many as an unofficial proof of experience
---
Do all your dragon bash dailies and some dragon bash stampedes and you can get enough gold for a full set of exotics in about an hour. Event is for about one more week, it’s great for some quick gold
---
While I agree with you on most points, "just dodge it" isn't a good solution in pvp with a class that has that much range.
---
You absolute animal that was great!!
---
This post put a huge smile on my face. Never lose that enthusiasm!
---
I haven't been playing much this month but now I kind of want to make a new character and just slowly take in the scenery and have fun with all these small systems that I've been taking for granted these last 7 years.
---
I'm pretty sure they already do use the charr skeleton. The only big difference between the two is that tengu have different feet models, but even then they follow a similar structure.
---
This is what thief dual wield should have been. When you wield two pistols or two daggers, skills 1 to 5 should change.
---
Why were those needed anyway? There are other achievements that need you to kill and rez things; they work without annoying buffs.
---
Ja selber Schuld, ne?
---
What makes it the best? Must be something teenagers find amusing, cause I clearly don't see it.
---
Seems really unoriginal and immature to me. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Now I'm curious what his character name is.
---
When we get new playable races, you bet there will be multiple armor sets incompatible with the new races.
---
Every single game out there works like this. They never adapt everything retroactively. Even GW1 did this with the new professions, you won't find any dervish equipment in Cantha, and most gear you get will be useless.
---
Omg put it near your cooch so he will literally go down on you and rub you back to life!  
---
500 IQ move tbh
---
Tengu, largos, and stone dwarves. That's my bet.
---
That is like expecting people to be correct on reddit based on their karma...
---
I assume you mean the insignia for ascended statswaping, as that exists, but exotic statswap does not?
---
It is elites also.
---
I do think we need GW3. The problem with GW2 is it burned way too many bridges during the first year. Lot of the people who left will never come back, not to GW2. Hell, most of the gaming community thinks GW2 died years ago. It's that bad.
---
GW3 would be a fresh start, and a new opportunity. Using GW2 assets would provide a polished launch product, mounts and wardrobe being two of the most important features. So GW3 could be GW2.5 for all I care.
---
Basically he found a way to have no cooldowns on his utilitys or elite.
---
It's confusing to most people first time you watch it I think.
---
True, not a big deal overall, but still can be quite frustrating sometimes (in my case).
---
That's why you don't pug raids unless you can carry pugs.
---
I’m currently in the process of doing this. I’m a fairly new player (2 months in). The bitterfrost frontier map has  map material (winterberries) which can be farmed daily on each character and can be consumed for unbound magic. There’s a vendor in that map that takes 500 unbound magic and 1 gold for t6 mats. You can also convert t5 mats into t6 mats at mystic forge. There are pvp reward tracks in wvw and other pvp game modes that give you clovers/shards. I pick the bloodstone fen reward track for the shards that can also be consumed for unbound magic as well.
---
They're neutral creatures from the Armageddon's Blade expansion yea. They're pretty rare in most maps though, you can get them in random maps once in a while, both as dwellings if you're lucky or just a random group on the map to fight.
---
Happy to help ✅
---
Norn should have been able to remain in their animal form, wasn't that their whole thing in GW?
---
Does this require a full update, or can I simply just replace the .exe?
---
Petrified Stumps in Ember Bay, Diffluorite Crystals in Sandswept Isles, Primordial Orchids in Draconis Mons, and Mistborn Motes in Dragonfall all drop Empyreal Fragments.  You also get them from every jumping puzzle chest.  If you want to be profitable while also getting tons of fragments silverwastes bandit chests and Dragonfall seem to be your best bet.
---
As someone who played a lot of other MMOs, I'm soo grateful for my brother for introducing me into guild wars 2. Seriously, this game is fantastic. The combat system is one of the best ones I have seen in MMos, the story is good, the graphics are good, and boy, it is soo much fun.
---
The Quetzal have been living there for 250 years and it can't be confirmed at the moment if they were ever part of the Dominion of the Winds.
---
I'm thinking it could be called the harlequin, a sort of circus performer class lol.
---
One of the missed opportunities in Dragonfall was Glint's army not having the ghosts of Pyre Fierceshot and Kalla Scorchrazor in their ranks in the battle against Kralkatorrik. It would've been nice to witness some banter between Pyre and Gwen (to show one of the few charr she somewhat tolerated), Pyre and Rytlock (double the VA fun with Steve Blum who voiced both characters; I can imagine Pyre's snarky commentary on Rytlock freeing Balthazar and wielding the god's former sword!), and some heartwarming dialogue between Pyre and his descendant Kalla too.
---
Still, what dialogue we did get between Rytlock, Logan and Gwen was nice with some fun banter between the three (particularly Rytlock and Gwen actually agreeing on their cynical views on the gods as opposed to Logan's more hopeful point of view), and I'm glad Gwen and Logan were given an opportunity to meet even though it would've been even more heartwarming to see Keiran fighting by his wife's side as well.
---
Still, I would've liked to learn more about Gwen's views on Logan's desertion during the first battle against Kralkatorrik which led to Glint and Snaff's deaths. Would she feel Logan's actions were justified due to him possibly being under Jennah's mesmeric geas plus how Logan's desertion and saving Jennah and thus Ebonhawke (and setting the stage for the Ebonhawke Treaty by enlisting the charr prisoners to help in the defense) led to a better future than if Jennah and Ebonhawke had fallen and Kryta had never had a treaty with charr when Caudecus would've likely succeeded Jennah on the vacant throne?
---
Speaking of which, in a perfect scenario we also would've seen the ghosts of Glint, Vlast, Snaff and Eir fighting on the front lines. Logan never apologized to Aurene for kinda causing her mom's death, and it would've been nice to have him and Glint have a heart to heart where Glint would comfort him about how his actions to save Ebonhawke were ultimately necessary for the better world Glint had in mind and how Glint now sees that her destiny was to always lead the ghost resistance to slow down Kralk's consumption of the Mists so that the mortal heroes could finish the job and fulfill her, Kralk and Aurene's prophecies. It would've likewise been touching to see a meeting between Glint, Vlast and Aurene so they could say their final farewells (unless the story had made Glint and Vlast perish in Kralk's maws to protect Aurene and Commander during the dragonflight moment in The End, thus giving even more weight to Kralk's final words about hoping that Aurene never has to kill what she loves.
---
Thanks for the lovely comics as usual, and enjoy the rest of summer. I look forward to more of Snargle's adventures in the future now that his pen name Snargle Goldclaw is generating more and more hype around Tyria as seen most recently in the dialogue of the Commander's little asura fan during Dragon Bash.
---
After the lovely bromance moment between Rytlock and Logan shown in the Citadel of Flame comic strip, I hope the comics also get to tackle some of the heavy dungeon subject matters like how Snargle comforts Caithe and prevents her from falling into Nightmare when her allies abandon her due to Faolain's manipulations in Twilight Arbor, Eir's heartbreaking suicide mission in Honor of the Waves after Zojja has chewed her out and how Snargle (who himself suffers from depression from time to time) actually snaps her out of it, or assisting Zojja in the cat and mouse chase as they try to track down and end her cunning archenemy Kudu's plans once and for all in Sorrow's Embrace and the Crucible of Eternity.
---
Another intriguing plot, which I think would contrast well with many of Snargle's nihilistic moments, would be his and Trahearne's encounter with the Pale Tree and actually receiving very comforting words of wisdom from the Tree during the vision journey into Orr...words that Snargle would do well to remember as dawn always comes even after the darkest night and how he is the catalyst to heal the wounds of Destiny's Edge and unite them for the final battle against Zhaitan. I'd also be very curious about Snargle's reactions to Zhaitan's manipulations regarding the fates of the three mentors, and how Zhaitan and Snargle could have a funny contest of the power of their respective necromantic magic during the battle depending on how serious or jokey that scene should be depicted as. :)
---
&gt; **Trahearne:** My friend and I seek to right that wrong. We wish to fight Zhaitan, and take back what was lost. We've to come to ask your counsel.  
---
&gt; **Avatar of the Tree:** The answer is at the heart of Tyria's future—and your own. Both of you must face the darkness, become guiding stars in the night. [...]  
---
&gt; **Trahearne:** These creatures are formidable. Tougher than the ones at Claw Island. How will we defeat them?  
---
&gt; **Avatar of the Tree:** Alone, you cannot. But with unity, you will find that many impossible things can be achieved.  
---
&gt; **Avatar of the Tree:** You must be what Tyria needs you to be, my son. You have more courage than you realize.  
---
&gt; **Avatar of the Tree:** The past taints the future. Our heroes have fallen. They must be redeemed.  
---
&gt; **Avatar of the Tree:** You are the catalyst. You must bring them together. Heal their wounds.

i agree, ff14 monk animations are lefigtt

GW2 is the game that I feel treats your time with the greatest amount of respect (while being regularly updated and supported). Many other games have patches/expansions that simply put a large amount of your progress in the trash can, and demand you to keep playing to keep up. As someone who has little time to play GW2 is perfect.
---
longbow isn't as good because the LB trait covers the Remorseless trait, it does make a meaningful choice which one you choose. If I wanted to use LB, I would choose the LB trait for WvW and Remorseless for PVP, the burst provided is just insane, plus free crit on weapon swap(because you get fury from skirmish).
---
This was hilarious when it finally happened to me, because I was playing my Guardian.

Bei mir wurde gar nicht nach Erst- oder Zweitsprache gefragt.

It is, you just need to know where to look for it.
---
Each Heroic Dragonsblood achievement opens three minor achievements and one major one to track things.  The major one tells you to "complete the three minor achievements, then go to the Heroic Font with a Vision Crystal".  The minor achievements, in turn, list their own specific requirements on their own achievements.
---
In your specific case, the achievement you need to finish for Deed #2 is Chasing Tales: Storm's Eye.
---
MMOs with off the top animations tend to have animation locks on movement. Not cool
---
Cause they bought this game so they're entitled to their fun, who cares about the fun of people who put effort into raids /s

Sorry bud, i'm past that already, too many fake leaks and disappointments recently, last real leak we got was pre pof ages ago, and then nothing else ever leaked correctly. At least your fanfiction will be easy to disprove real soon if the next LS has nothing to do with anything you said.
---
No, I'm the kind of player who looks mechanics up before doing content... don't need someone training me on how to do what I know how to do
---
You are so right in your assessment of the most weapons in this game. Some of the greatswords and hammers look like they are so frickin' heavy that a few swings would wear out the wielder's arms and shoulders.
---
And of course the thread was already deleted. What a surprise.
---
They actually exist in this universe but were never portrayed xD
---
&gt;Gonna give no info on how I know this and will probably not answer any questions

aka i pulled it out of my ass
---
You sound like a low-IQ American, just saying.
---
We know little about largos, but we know they are not quite exactly like predators, despite the similarities.
---
Predators do predate. They eat their targets or at least part of them. Some faction of them seem to be also taking genetic material from their victims to improve themselves.  They are more bestial, more like hunter-predators, and they rarely hunt together the same target.  
---
Largos in the other hand appear to be more like a large scale order of assassins or bounty-hunters.   
---
At least in one occasion we can get a largos to help us by helping them with their target, so they do not seem to have nothing against collaboration.  
---
When they are not given targets by their houses, they appear to spend their time training and challenging strong opponents.  
---
It stands to reason that they get some prestige within their society from the targets they defeat, but their approach to the task is quite more clean and professional.
---
It's as if someone had taken traits from the zola from legend of zelda, drow from D&amp;D and a bit from predators and put them together as a race of murderous fishy elves.
---
You dont need to craft infusions if you go to the npc inside fractals where you can buy higher tier infusions.
---
I already own PoF, but my brother-in-law doesn't own it or the heart of thorns expansion (and also doesn't reddit). He's been wanting to get back into the game, but feels left out without the expansion. 
---
If I win, I'll pass it on to him (and hopefully make a redditor out of him in the process)
---
Not sure if you're trolling, but none of this sounds remotely believable. Which is good, because most of this sounds horrible.
---
Hey, you might wanna back up those claims that ur dps is on par with others by some logs? You're using arcdps so u can easily save them and upload it to dps.report.
---
Right now you're just falsely claiming you're doing good, and even then being on par with people that do like 10-13k on KC or other easy bosses as dps is still bad so there's a lot of context missing :)
---
Welcome to Guild Wars 2!
---
Say what you want but I think it was my meteor showers that mage you rage the most.
---
Wow.... From your post I would not have guessed you're college age.
---
I'm glad adults can still get so excited over a new game!
---
Anything new anet adds to the game is bugged: check
---
Engineer ruining a pvp game mode: check
---
wvw is shit: check
---
0% surprised.
---
Infusions no longer need to be crafted.  There's a vendor now.
---
It has nothing to do with that though. Not trying to make a statement here, it was simply based on a joke from our discord.
---

---
Everyone is welcome to join us.
---
Its like its possibly true but also possibly fake. I have always believed elite specs could come with season 5 it would be idiotic to leave them for the next expansion. The story while I don't believe it because of the almost world ending story of season 4 it sounds cool.
---
~~Well technically undead ones appeared in GW1~~
---
Nah, I refuse to believe such a preposerous animal exists. Really, the front half of some deer like creature and the back half of a centaur? 
---
More likely an inquest experiement gone wrong.
---
I love customizing my character 🎉💖! Thank you for doing this giveaway :D
---
First thing thanks for doing this for the community!  
---
I've been playing for some time with a couple friends, but one of then is missing PoF expasion! It would be awsome if i could give him a code soo he can finally unlock the new specializations!!  
---
Good luck to everyone !
---
If you want to hop in a training server we'd love to have you at RA.
---
The game is PEGI13, so that kind of lfg has to be reported even if it's a joke. 
---
Some would say especially if it's a joke.
---
Before the reports start rolling in, this is allowed as per our rules: 
---
**Looking for group**
---
Using this subreddit as the LFG is not allowed. **You are allowed to search for people to play with** and advertise events you are organizing.
---
I will make sure everyone gets cookies! &lt;3
---
lol me
---
Source: voices in my head
---
wow thanks for exposing. cant be called hidden now.
---
yeh see, if you want to actually bother doing fractals and have easy time pugging or even finding static group. You're better of running a meta build, both the time of finding groups and time to complete content will be faster. But making scrapper a good enough boonbot to be usefull in fractals wo hoping others will pick up the slack would make it absolutely broken in wvw/pvp or ruin the heal output to make up for it, so tbh it's in a good spot rn.
---
I love reading new players loving the game 😄 Reminds me of myself 4 years ago :)
---
I was actually hoping for something like Alt FX to replace Racial Skills. [Even posted about it a while ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/61481c/comment/dfc5xul).
---
I can't vouch for the credibility of this "leak", but it would be an interesting feature.
---
I only made my DH for PvP years ago and it has been deleted so I can't comment on that but it looks like you are missing conditions on the boss.
---
Again, not a guardian player so I don't know if that is the definite issue but if you have a trait with damage changing due to condis on the boss, that might be it.
---
I almost didn't put this part because it sounds fake as hell, but through Jormag, all things are possible. &lt;3
---
Your mom was the Norn XD IIRC
---
They're pretty easy to miss unfortunately so can't really blame you. The expansion also added Rust dragons, Crystal dragons AND Azure dragons, but since all 4 of these dragons are super high value they very rarely appear, unless placed manually. Super cool units though.
---
LOL I think I just saw a class with signets that I don't usually play and didn't think had signets.
---
Hm that condi firebrand one looks interesting, could you please tell me more about your build? I always liked condition builds more. Could you please just give me some pointers on what to pay attention etc? :)
---
 
---
I started gw2 many times but couldnt continue playing as I didnt have much time.
---
I have characters around lvl 40-50. I feel like there are so many things to do.
---
I like pve a lot, not much of a pvp player.
---
But as I didnt play for a long time I feel overwhelmed with all those things to do.
---
Can you give me a simple roadmap on what to do in a simple order. (so that I can have optimized fun)
---
I especially like playing with different classes and mastering them.
---
I played WOW for a long time before, but left the game about 4 years ago.
---
I know there are a lot of guides I checked faq section of the subreddit.
---
But even those many guides overwhelm me and break my will to play the game.
---
I know this game is worth to play, but I just dont know the optimal way to have fun.
---
Can u please help me guys by a simple roadmap.
---
Path of Exile do the same thing with good effect. Not sure how well it would translate to GW2 though, the competitive gamemodes specifically, since recognising skill effects and reacting accordingly is one of the major aspects of fighting other players.
---
Entertaining, but unlikely.
---
I play it on/off for years. I seem to always return to it for some reason.
---
Still enjoying HoT :)
---
Crossbreading has been ruled out as canon by devs. Send your complaints to Anet.
---
SC uses a large golem for DH benchmarks.
---
You're trying too hard :)
---
I'm working on Sharur right now. Now that I know it's that rare it makes me even more excited about it! I can't help it, I always gravitate towards the least popular stuff... It's RARE  \\ \^\_\^ /
---
&gt; \-I heard something similar about “jacked mordrem sylvari from the other  tree”. They mentioned a character with a name that sounded like a sith  lord. but IDK if that was a joke. IDK if this is a new race or something  Sylvari can do to themselves. 
---
MALYCK. I FIGURED OUT THE FAKE PUZZLE XD
---
Malyck found the other tree, which has playable mordrem sylvari?
---
Man I wish I could go back and reexperience it with your eyes. After 6 years of playing I feel like I'm jaded. I remember feeling a lot like you when I first played. I was literally jittering in my seat hardly being able to contain my emotion. My brother was laughing because I looked like a little kid on Christmas. I was 23 years old when this game came to my hands. You, sir or madam, have just entered a world you will soon never forget. Welcome, Commander.
---
wow
---
yeah, i was alone and thus was sure Noone did 
---
Also Noone in any Group ever used it, and as those are the same keys my dodge and autorun are Bound to, ist a rare combination to fatfinger - i guess i just did for the first time
---
After Skritt, sure.
---
Why did you use a medium golem for your second try?
---
As an ex teacher as of 5 days ago, best of luck on your journey! It's a difficult job but a very satisfying occupation too. I'm going back to my engineering roots but I enjoyed teaching these last 4 years quite a lot :-)
---
seems pretty chaotic for PvP, at a high level anyway.
---
I knew what to expect, and was still amused :P
---
It's probably their attempt to quiet the whole thing down without having to actually fix it.
---
Very nice quality!
---
Or if you're in mobile can just zoom in without any quality loss. Thank you for research
---
Can you add your in-game name so people can add you to their friends list?
---
The whole ep. 6 was a huge missed opportunity:
---
* Desmina nowhere to be seen, should have been leading some of the Underworld forces to help us. Forged and Eternals nowhere to be seen either. Same for druids. The three realms are empty and devoid of interesting characters and landmarks.
---
* No more "Mist bubbles" with access to other locations and dimensions. Using this would have been better than just taking whole landmasses from the Mists. The skyscales could have gotten their own bubble as well, instead of just popping out of nowhere.
---
* Kralkatorrik should have crashed west of the Desolation, into the desert. That would have saved us the embarrassment that are the square islands, and let us explore a location with actual buildings and history.
---
* The Mist Wardens should have been the leading force, after being teased for two whole episodes. The Olmakhan and the Order of the Crystal Bloom should have remained as secondary actors. I agree Kalla Scorchrazor should have been one of the leading ghost heroes.
---
* Almorra needed more screentime, and her warband should have appeared among the ghost army. She got no proper closure, and that's unforgivable.
---
* This was supposed to be a great final, yet there's dozens of important characters missing, including: Koss, Zojja, Amala, Kasmeer, Marjory, etc.
---
But then again, I'm still bitter Turai Ossa didn't join us during the Battle of Gandara. The twin queens are nice, but they don't have the same weight as the true hero of Elona.
---
It makes sense to create a throwaway account to leak info you don't want traced back to you.
---
OP could be on a list of players that get invited to focus group tests and would want to keep this privilege.
---
And if it is info from such a test, its the kind of place where you put out your crazy, unrefined, ideas before giving them polish (or throwing them away).
---
That said, it could still be fake or trolling. Or OP could be aming wide in hopes to get some things right. 
---
But, it could be possible we see one or more of these ideas in a more polished state in game in the future.
---
[You tell me, lol.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/2659oq/everything_that_is_wrong_with_gw2_rewards/)
---
you could make it so in PvP it defaults to the standard models, I think.
---
only conditions that boost dragonhunter damage are cripple and burning, and it has both!
---
like with models, the animations could default to a standard in PvP.
---
You're overthinking it way too much. Take a random class you like, get to max level, gear it up (metabattle has both guides and builds), do story and masteries in order. You can also level up some crafts and do map completion in core game if you like, but it's not necessary at start.
---
After that you can chase skins you like and do some group content.
---
I don't see any hits missing, why would it matter???
---
I’d say even doing this dungeon once a day on your Grind is enough. This is probably one of the easiest items to obtain of the whole recipe
---
Aw, better than moot loot
---
Try scepter 5 2 4 soj 
---
GS 2 f1 4 soj both traps gw2
---
Scepter 4 2 soj
---
Generally repeat while spamming gs2 and only use f1 before burst but should basically be used off cooldown 
---
You click skills a lil too slow and don't weapon swap at correct time
---
Yea.. I mean, if it's on a norn or a charr I can sorta see it.. but my human female warrior can't physically lift something like the Abaddon Hammer..
---
Other obvious things to check - all of your gear has stats selected? Runes placed in correctly?
---
Thiiiiis. I have so many "cosplay" largos characters in game. My kingdom to make my lovely fish friends legit. Sadly, I'm never expecting them to actually add new races, the work load would probably be too much but if they ever did my heart would be so full.
---
Im amazec, 10k no infusion.
---
Well, with magic you can mix a lot of things.  
---
Slothasor is half grub. Magic spliced grub DNA on it and now its young are slublings that start with grub-like bodies and sloth heads. 
---
But half-norn would be a massive waste of resources because they would have no unique points. It'd be easier to give them armor, but the time it would take to make a new race would be better used in something else, even if they also had humanoid bodies to save time on armors, like largos, echovald warden, ghosts, awakened, whatever kind of Mists Entity Razah. 
---
The Mist Stranger Outfit looks kind of what a mists entity like razah could look like if they were survivors from some grand scale cataclysm in the mists that twisted their arm into a more demonic appearance.  You know, like a giant dragon burning their homes, branding their friends and family and literally eating their entire reality out of existence. 
---
And let's not forget we haven't seen even 1/8th of the world. There has to be something completely new and different we haven't seen before out there. But human-norn hybrids?  
---
Too bland for a new race.
---
Reasons why I procrastinate on doing the main storyline.
---
1. Too sleepy
---
2. zzzzz
---
3.
---
I'm not sure I get it. None of the chat in this image is remotely interesting.
---
thanks :) I think you are right
---
Probably some rando asshat.
---
I was looking to get back in. I'll try to earn one, I was hoping for a long time to get the rifle on the rogue.
---
#1 reason: Be faster, in your 2nd rotation you are Autoattacking between GS4 and GS2, and right after GS2 too, same goes for your 2nd swap from GS to S/F you are casting AA after GS2 before swapping. after that swap, you use focus 4,5 and sword of justice instantly instead of waiting for the next time you use scepter 2. if you had done that all their damage would have been under spear of justice 20% dmg mod. Same part, you swap from scepter to GS when scepter 2 had 1.5 sec cooldown left, should have waited there to cast scepter 2 and then swap to GS. at 2:14 you don't swap fast enough ^^ so you miss the spear of justice under your GS 4 GS2 combo which is a massive loss. I could go on but i advice you to watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ-uNICcmSI to really learn how the rotation works. gl!
---
Humor is subjective. Get over it.
---
It's one thing to cross-breed abominations or monsters and the other to create new intelligent race.
---
Me and my friend have been playing GW2 for over a year now. I bought both expansions like... after 2 months. The game is fantastic and I don't regret buying it. Unfortunetly, my friend isn't so lucky. She's still in core game and her current situation doesn't let her buy anything. I'm leaving this comment here in her name. She doesn't have a reddit account and doesn't know about it so it would be a cool surprise.
---
Pick a character you like: this one is going to be the one you play through the rest of the story with. Possibly do more things. In this game, mastery is frequently rewarded by which I mean, focusing on one character to be your go-to. It will make combat easier, and it will give you (1) person's progress to track. You can do this with just about any DPS/power build. I would not pick a heal build, and condi can work, but will be difficult with some things like hitting down objects for map complete.
---
Go grab the basic world boss wps, to start out with, and I guess the dungeons. If you want the glider/mount, play through each of the expac stories. It will be easier to do this on a level 80, or with help of people on 80s.  It'd probably wouldn't hurt if you keep an eye out for helpful looking guilds that recruit as you do this stuff--getting others to help you will help you achieve your goals.
---
Play through the story. If you like, go to the dungeons where they intersect with where you are with the story. When you need to take breaks, go hit up world bosses, or gathering, or mapping. For the sake of effiency, it will be easier if you keep the activities narrowed down by character. You can also start leveing crafting if you want--it's best to focus on the gear/items for your primary first. Also, if there are festivals active you can dedicate a character to doing those activities. And if you want to get invested in fractals--good money, gear options--pick a character for that, if it's not your primary character. (Same critera as above for that character.)
---
While you are doing all of the above: focus on getting your primary character to 80, do dailies every day you can for money and resources. Get the exotic gear that fits the build you want. If you need to, research builds on Metabattle or Discritize or Snowcrows to figure out what that gear is, and how to play the character. After you get the exo gear, you can start upgrading it to ascended, which can be traded freely among characters on your account, which can be handy if you decide you want to swap characters. The gear stuff is covered in full [here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character), if you need to read up on it. And get 18 slot bags for your most played characters. Once your character is at 80, get them the most useful looking spec. Look for HP trains in LFG or ask in the starting maps in each zone if there's one active you can join.
---
If you get through all that, you will have one character you can do most things on, the means to gear other characters on your account to play on alts, and an idea of how to complete those characters/what your tastes in characters are.
---
Or somebody attempting to role play, in a role playing game. We don’t know why this person posted this, but to assume it’s because they’re immature or joking is very presumptive. For all we know, they may have struggled with this side of themselves for a long time (either being gay or BDSM, both can seen as shameful if raised in certain religions), and they’re looking to finally explore it in a place that they feel safe. Even if they were just cruising, it’s better to have that in LFG than in map chat.

"GetSmartOrGetHurt" - Which did you manage to do? It's most certainly not the first.
---
Nah. Sexual innuendo would be a "if you know what I mean" kind of joke. This would be already PEGI 16 as it's mentioning specific terms like "dom".

One of the best games I ever played.

Appreciate the tip.

I'm not using overlay.

I think it is allways like that, you can try it yourself. Right click &gt; drag mouse to your minimap and use scroll wheel.

How does the sand taste?

You can't tell the difference between gamebreaking bugs due to trash tier events and "minmaxing" strong skills. Why am I suprised that you are indeed a complete idiot? Oh wait I'm not.

With the ESRB (NA ratings board), online interactions between players are not rated, seems PEGI and CERO would be the same. Otherwise, any game with a chat box would pretty much default to 18+.
---
!RemindMe 8 months
---
Just looking at the first few seconds: you're autoattacking when you're not supposed to (on GS) in the opener, turn off autoattack. You're also not autoattacking when you are supposed to (using sc auto to cancel scepter 2). You're also not using skills quickly enough, once you get a feel for CDs you should be "queueing" skills in a way that they go off immediately after each other
---
Yes of course i have food =/
---
Maybe when guild wars 3 comes outs
---
... or we won't, that content being lost in the realignment at Anet.
---
I just want to throw it away, man. But I just...cannot...destroy...!!
---
Must be the hoarder in me :-)
---
Will try faster... Have 0 hopes though
---
Got it, you are a shithead who complains about how everything is shit with something and yet never manages to move away from it. Kudos!
---
I seriously doubt i can do it "faster" (when i try faster i just end up canceling my skills). I guess ill stick to healing
---
Did you consider throwing all the rares into the forge instead of salvaging for ectos?  Small chance a precursor might have popped up, and make a 2nd place prize instead of infusion.
---
If you get that one done, you could do these next:

Mesmer is based off Blue from Magic the Gathering [collectable trading card game].

Would love to be able to keep up with all the mounted players for a change !

I think most people would consider acting like a jerk, or a know it all, was sign of immaturity...
---
&gt;NEW RACE: 
---
nice try buddy
---
Oh shit here we go again! circlejerk time
---
It's so lovely to see such wide-eyed enthusiasm &lt;3
---
here is the thing, if you have a drop rate of 1/10k and open exactly 10k boxes, you have only a 50% chance of getting the item :D
---
I love GW2 but I am too poor to buy pof expansion thank you
---
Oh haha, hello there! I wasn't in Lions Arch for all that long with it out, so colour me surprised!
---
Do you have a commander tag yet? This opened up a whole new side of the game for me when I was completely burned out from PVP. You now have the power to help tons of other people achieve things that they couldn't do alone. The more you give the more you receive as they say. Sounds like you would be a good commander having a lot of experience in the game. 
---
Another alternative is lower your playtime or take extended breaks so when you play it still feels fresh. A video game should be fun and not feel like a chore, otherwise what is the point of **playing?**
---
Oof I’m sitting at 4.5k. Is there a good way to dump them?
---
&gt; I think most sensitive people would consider people smarter than them, who says things bluntly and truthfully, were showing signs of immaturity...
---
FTFY friend
---
&gt;	I still can’t decide what to play! Im deciding on thief or revenant. I heard thief is not that good like its getting nerfed hard. So i guess revenant? Man im so confused what to do everything looks good!
---
Honestly, I strongly advise you to play whichever class you enjoy the most.
---
Every class has its pros and cons, but at the end of the day, *every single class* is viable for endgame content (despite what some might tell you).
---
Also, try not to base your decision on which class was buffed/nerfed recently, because balance changes occur regularly enough to where your balance-related decision will inevitably become obsolete and invalid.
---
What I’m trying to say, is that thief is a great choice, and that you wouldn’t be any better off choosing revenant instead (UNLESS you wind up preferring that class).
---
Finally, until you run out of character slots, I would advise that you try out different classes. For example, not sure if you should pick thief or revenant? Why not both? I think it’s safe to say that the majority of players have multiple characters with different classes.
---
Welcome to GW2!
---
Not at the moment, it's the smallest, least intrusive font I have so I used that. Adding fonts to TacO is tricky because it uses prerasterized bitmap fonts that need to be in a specific format.
---
Let me know if it made a difference :)
---
If you craft a lot of legendaries they go fast
---
In theory just replacing the exe should be ok, but the zip is put together in a way so that you should be able to overwrite your TacO folder's contents with it without causing any harm. Just make a backup and try it if you want to test it out :)
---
No fractal 100 before HoT. Back then you couldn't simply "choose" whichever fractals you wanted (only reroll for the one you wanted to start with) so people were forced to learn all fractals. Imo they were also more punishing before powercreep and scaling to 100. Overall the pugs were generally better and at least learned the mechanics of each fractal. So fractals pre HoT werent more "casual friendly" at all. 
---
On HoT release they were made easier and gradual to appeal more towards the casual playerbase. The result was minimum effort farming similar to silverwastes; resulting in far more "casual" pugs who despite doing fractals regularly had no interest in mechanics. A split between people interested in gameplay and those interested in rewards / buttonmashing is inevitable.
---
Same thing happened to me too. Pumped 20 Gal of water and removed 150 sqft of carpet. You're not alone on this soggy Monday morning/afternoon.
---
It's always the Asura.
---
Bet it cost less than 2500 gold to craft....
---
Well font isn't that important, but for my blind eyes is size just way too small:-D
---
That's my point. For TacO (and any bitmap font system that doesn't want you to strain because of blurry text) different font size = different font.
---
RiP Kodash.
---
Exactly. I believe GW2 is not visibly enough to the public. If more people see this kind of mount gameplay, It will gain more popular.
---
Wholesome post. Welcome, OP.
---
:D
---
Know I now which crazy guy always buying my stacks of coffers
---
With such attitude you can easily expect Marvin the Martian invading Tyria in next episode :)
---
i mean im 21 i said its the best lfg i saw since 90% of the lfg community is basic crap without any life inside or toxic raid groups that cant even hit somewhat good dps but hey sounds like a you problem if u gotta assume :) never said its amusing
---
yeah, i screwed up royally on the 1st try, its in the OP...
---
Still, if you look at both rotations (they both suck whatever) the 2nd is \*much\* "better", and the dps is barely higher.
---
They don't have total uptime, for sure. That doesn't matter through a burst, though, as they can activate their unblockable modifiers immediately before blowing you up. In particular, [Unstoppable Union](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Unstoppable_Union) grants them 4s of unblockable on-demand at the cost of nothing but a trait slot.
---
The fact that you've killed some SBs with reflects does not mean the class is balanced. It means you killed some SBs who either didn't know they had access to unblockable, or you outplayed them by dodging their unblockable burst and then reflecting their follow-up combo. Not to take anything away from either player; the matchup _shouldn't_ be 100-to-0 in either player's favour, and you clearly played your class better than the other guy. It's more that, in general, you shouldn't assume that Magnetic Aura is a guaranteed solution to heavy SB burst kills.

really thanks for your detailed reply.
---
Your idiocy becomes extremely clear when you make assumptions the way you have been.
---
Stop with the self-exposure.
---
There's no voice chat in GW2, idk why this would be relevant to the sub.
---
Jawohl
---
and what does this have to do with gw2?
---
Loving this game so far.
---
Actually, it's closer to 63% ( [Bernoulli Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_process) ), but still unfortunate.
---
**Bernoulli process**
---
In probability and statistics, a Bernoulli process (named after Jacob Bernoulli) is a finite or infinite sequence of binary random variables, so it is a discrete-time stochastic process that takes only two values, canonically 0 and 1. The component Bernoulli variables Xi are identically distributed and independent.  Prosaically, a Bernoulli process is a repeated coin flipping, possibly with an unfair coin (but with consistent unfairness).  Every variable Xi in the sequence is associated with a Bernoulli trial or experiment.

That could work, would fit the mesmer theme.
---
Im totally giving up. I play games for fun, and this is the definition of "not worth" for me. I just dont have the willpower. 
---
I already knew this wasn't gonna work when i saw the rotation (which is the easiest LOL) was 33 steps.
---
Yep I've made it work with combination of that framework file and naming of each file in order I want them to sort, but thing is I would like change name of something in that framework file, where I've basically made duplicate categories and display name would take priority over display names in other files, now I have to change display names in every file in order to make it work:-D
---
Btw for menu, you don't have to make complete rework. Just that offset to the left and maybe allow us to code our categories into the first menu level not second should solve a lot of current issues.
---
However small this may seem, it contributes to my general unhappiness with GW2. I cared about current events so much. LS3 was the most exciting time to me, I basically slept in tinfoil hat. Sigh..
---
1: Sure.
---
2: Never argue with idiots, it'll only drop your own IQ.
---
3: The purpose of this comment is too complex for you to comprehend.
---
Thanks for the responses, guys. I'm gonna try rolling a new character. I don't think necro is for me.
---
I'd love to enter this give away! My friend wants to run a guild wars 2 based table top game and I'd love to be able to check out the game with them. I just started playing.
---
I'm seeing some higher-level advice with builds and such (at 16, you barely have access to utility skills, so don't worry about the online guides yet).  
---
For where you are right now, explore all the different weapon types you can use. Staff is low damage and leans toward area attacks, so it tends to work better with minions. You can get weapons from some of the vendors in capital cities, or if you're comfortable with the trading post, you can search higher quality gear there. The recommendations for Axe/Dagger/gear with Power on it is pretty solid for most of the base game. 
---
As you go forward, you can branch out. Don't worry about mis-spending your hero points for skills and traits. You'll be able to buy them all by level 80. So feel free to experiment with each skill as you earn them, and as you find favorites, look for traits that synergize with them.
---
And you shouldn't expect people to willingly want to carry someone who's under-performing so terribly that it's causing wipes and you refuse to kick the under-performer just because they're your friend/guildmate.
---
why is it always assumed that teenagers are the only type to engage in this type of behaviour or find it amusing? as far as i'm aware different tastes in humour are not age restricted, they might mature and change as you age but that doesn't mean that *only* teenagers will do this or find it funny.
---
I'm not. I dont care.
---
Definitely concur.  The main difference is small group content vs open world.  In open world I'd definitely recommend adding some toughness/vitality up to your personal comfort level.  Guardian hybrids are great and a lot of fun to play.
---
If things get confusing the wiki is AMAZING. Sometimes I just browse that and learn so much more that I didn't know ([wiki.guildwars2.com](https://wiki.guildwars2.com)) Also I use this boss timer to know when world bosses show up ([http://guildwarstemple.com/dragontimer](http://guildwarstemple.com/dragontimer)). I know there are better ones out there but this is the one I like. My number one piece of advice though is just to **slow down and take in the environments**. Each region is crazy unique and sometimes I try to get as high as I can just to take in the view. Been playing since early GW1 days and I still love it. Also, most regions have a meta event (map wide chain of events that nets some decent loot). Ask around, join a guild, enjoy yourself! Super excited for you. Welcome to Tyria!
---
To single out a race - is kinda racist. Could just have said " Kids on the mic" - Would not have changed this "meme" in any way.
---
i hope you are trolling tho - As your statement seems to suggest
---
Yup Fractals frequently, and very rarely from Raids.
---
I would start playing gw2 again straight away if this happend
---
But is your hand big and black enough to hold it?
---
Well which discipline(s) did you do?
---
It can be done on any class, just hit weapon stow when you're deactivating the bar, it'll cancel the deactivation and reset the cooldowns.
---
One thread in wvw forums already deleted, bet the mod didn't even bother to read the thread and report it to the team, got a warning to say as such lol. Reported in the wvw, general, bug forums, bug reported in game, messaged to team member. Let's see if anything is done, or swept under the rug like the golem event.
---
Been playing since GW1. Although my time to play has gone down since my High School days, I still get the itch to dive back in and explore the maps pretty often.
---
I also just got [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/383356806921191427/597862216271790080/unknown.png) [error](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/383356806921191427/597869111040671753/unknown.png)
---
Just don't play the game, fixed.
---
/s
---
You're landing on the block list because of how fucking stupid u are. Underperforming doesnt mean wiping a raid over and over again, underperforming doesnt mean doing 4k dps. Underperforming means that a person cannot consistently perform a rotation and cannot successfuly take care of encouter mechanics i.e. sloth mushrooms. World isn't black and white, there's a spectrum of people with different skill levels. 
---
And before you say I dont understand the disscusion, read the thread you're replying to again. spoiler: it's elitist bullshit. 1 mediocre person in a good group doesn't mean the whole group will fail already easy content.
---
this post is going to be downvoted to oblivion, but youre right. its why Anet was forced to only charge for expansions as their business model. People will eat your soul out for posting this but they are wrong and it cant be stressed enough, as good as a game GW2 is, my kids are not going to be touching any games that use lootbox mechanics, ever.
---
I'm an engineer (Holosmith) and have powered up armorsmithing, leathercrafting, and weaponcrafting.  I knew that the 32 slot bags would be useful, so I've made some of those to help with storage.
---
The expansion added elite specs, and elite specs make classes sorta a new class. That's where "core" comes from. Core is just the regular old class not using an elite spec.
---
In PvE, core classes are effectively never used anymore. Pretty much just warrior on very specific fights, but even still people generally won't use it on those fights, going to an elite warrior spec instead. I think core classes are more or less still viable, they just aren't as good.
---
PvP is a little different. Some core builds are the best that class can get, but it's still mostly elite specs that end up being better. Thief is still mostly played core for PvP though.
---
If you honestly think Black Lion Chest Keys are ANet's main source of income, you're sorely ill-informed.
---
Ive been playing a little over 5 years now and I've barely touched spvp and wvw. I've made at least a dozen characters and gotten full map completion with most of them. I've done tons of achievements and hunted down a few legendaries on and off. I've managed to push myself to high level fractals and beat a few of the early raids. 
---
SPVP and WvW on the other hand I know nothing about and feel a bit uncomfortable playing now because I'm so far behind in tactics and low level I feel like I can't keep up.
---
You do realise those are benchmarks with perfect rotation, right? 
---
You need just a bit more than a third of this to  "do your part" in raids. These videos show the potential DPS when everything is going on perfectly. 
---
If you're topping DPS in Fractals, thats the proof you're a cut above the edge. Hitting a stationary golem and killing bosses are veeery different things. Doing mechanics and dodgin the right stuff &gt; top DPS.
---
It's perfect because they record for hours until they get the result they want. There's been plenty of examples where people benched higher than SC, but difference was insignificant anyway.
---
All of that is irrelevant if you cant reproduce it in actual raids, which they do since they also record low man kills and speedclears. Try to macro in raids and see how far you can go with that.
---
Recently started playing on a whim from a pal and have to say I'm loving it! Not very far in, but I'm playing an Asuran Necromancer bc who doesn't want to be a small smarmy big eared boney-boi
---
Try [this guide pinned on the official forums](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/870006/#Comment_870006) for some tips on early game leveling, builds, and gameplay.
---
I'd love to have it so my SO could play together. She doesn't play games but i convinced her to give GW2 a try - only downside is that we only run trhought the map so our level is pretty low (i have a special character i only use to play with her, so it hasnt leveled much i have tomes of knowledge but she doesnt get any) and we can't go to other inital cities since there's a lvl 35 requirement to enter LA (i had no idea this was a thing!) so it's been kinda discouraging. I've wanted to buy one of the xpacs for her for so long but i'm always low on money, specially with the conversion rate to my currency so i'd really appreciate it - and she would even more. 
---
Thanks for doing this! c:
---
-"too slow" seems to be the winning reason on every post. I guess i won't be playing DPS any time soon (like, ever).
---
-I seriously doubt i can do it "faster" (when i try faster i just end up canceling my skills). I guess ill stick to healing
---
-Will try faster... Have 0 hopes though
---
-Im totally giving up. I play games for fun, and this is the definition of "not worth" for me.
---
Dont give up. Gw2 is not a game where you pick one role and are stuck there forever. " i play DPS in (cm) fractals i always end up top or near" SC benchmarks are very hard to match 100% then when you actually get into a fight your knowledge of the fight is just as if not more important than how well you can bench. Combine encounter knowledge with rotation knowledge and you end up being ahead of a large portion of the player base and if you are not the top 1% of players you are still in a great spot. 
---
As for advice for your rotation, finish your auto chains(gs only for DH) and think preemptively for skill usage so you are rdy to do the next step instead of of hey skill is off cd time to press the button. I dont know if this will work for you but its helped me perform better.
---
Thanks for introducing me to this eloquent man who seems to have a pretty critical view of the gaming industry in general. Lots of interesting videos to watch.
---

I love underwater combat/exploration in this game 😳
---
Our pumps weren't getting it out to the street or further away drains.  I think we're going to have to call some drainage experts.  There were more questionable design choices made with this house than I'd like to admit.  Glad to know I'm not the only one!  Waterpark for all!

---
I'd rather keep the top level menu as small as possible, it's quite large as it is right now, having data-driven stuff in there would quickly turn it into a mess. I'll think about doing something about the sorting stuff, it's a valid concern I haven't thought of before.
---
&gt; For what purpose, I wonder? What do you gain from this?
---
A subreddit where not every user's post where they tell other players what to do and dont do is called a PSA.
---
It would probably cost 400 gems. That's 130 gold. Let's say your average WP costs 3 silver. That means you'd have to use over 4.000 waypoints to break even. Try counting your teleports in an average day of playing and see how long it would take you to reach 4k+.
---
Let’s assume this imaginary item costed 800 gems, because it probably would. 800 gems = ~200g, so you’d have to spend 200g on waypoints to make up the cost. The average waypoint is like 2s, but let’s just say it’s 3.3s to make the math easy and to prove the point. You’d have to use 6600 waypoints to just break even, and that’s from traveling between rata sum and vabbi over and over, the average cost is much lower. Wouldn’t be worth it even if it existed imo.
---
I get what you are saying, but please consider something.  Can you give an example of any time that a population had 100% compliance to your ideal?  Or any ideal?  Realistically speaking, it just doesn't happen.
---
Also, you ask if we should ban cars because some people might be hurt by them.  Cars and driving \*are\* regulated.  It's an extremely bad analogy.
---
Tengu? I wanna play as a Quaggan :(
---
Oh, maybe? I figured it would need an update. When I'm back at my PC I'll try moving it, though it's not on the bottom of my screen.
---
Go to window edit mode and resize the raid status window ;)
---
Fine, change the car to kitchen knives then.
---
Or bicycles. 
---
Or balls.
---
Subscriptions are no guarantee of anything with regards to development.
---
absolutely, as i said, i would only pay for one if there was a way to know it DID guarantee i was getting what i paid for, though i dont really think there is a way to achieve that.
---
Ideally you'll want to blast in every group so everyone gets the same stealth duration for same period of time.
---
You have blasts on many toolbelt skills such as bomb kit, mortar kit, thumper turret, mines etc.
---
Only 5 people can blast 1 smoke field. Fields have priority - first placed = first one to be blasted. Skills with both combo field and combo finisher tend to interact with themselves most of the time so avoid using them if your goal is another effect.
---
If you blast stealth gyro then it's probably not wise to have anyone in your party blast because stealth pulses so you end up with more stealth than other parties. Your party also needs to be pretty stacked to get stealth.
---
Reserving your logic, because knives, balls, and other objects that people CAN be damaged from aren't banned, surely we should allow everyone to be able to own a nuclear explosive device.  Why should anyone be banned from owning one?
---
this games business model is not a failure. are you kidding me?
---
its way to fair imo. just imagine how much more money they could make when there wouldnt be gold to gems and they just could hand out as much gems as they want.
---
veterans and no-lifers dont spend RL money on the game anymore because we make gold from everything left and right. its way to easy.
---
he is actually one of the good ones out there. I enjoy his content.
---
you make good points, a sub model would probably hurt this game more regardless of it they did it now or back at launch. i think a big fear of mine stems from the fact that this current business model forces them to find an acceptable balance between content and content that makes them money. mounts were an obvious but very well executed idea so props to them, i just hope they dont intend on designing future content with the goal of making it as gem store monetize-able as possible, since without expansions they literally have no other way of making money.
---
This is an unconventional post. I already own PoF. But my girlfriend doesn't. I grew up playing the original Guild Wars; taking down the Lich, avenging the Emperor and killing Shiro, creating a new God with Abbadon's fall, and destroying the destroyer. I played with all my friends in middle school, but by the end of high school, I was the only one left, still trying to max out my Hall of Monuments for the sequel to my favorite game. 
---
I played Guild Wars 2 alone, made some new friends in the game, and honestly love it more than the first game. Guilds could use some work. But I explored everything, every map, every jumping puzzle, found nods to my childhood game. Then I took a long break: not enough content. I decided to come back with HoT, and then PoF, and I've been playing ever since. 1000 hours logged. I got to reunite with Koss and Dunkoro, save the world with Ogden again. My girlfriend asked what I've been playing and why I loved it so much, and I explained. She started playing with me, and it was like I was a kid in middle school again, but this time guiding someone through all the moments I'd shared alone with fresh eyes. She particularly liked killing leeches in Caledon Forest (she's a Sylvari). I'd give her this key (she's not on reddit), and this time show her around Elona, and maybe take out an altogether different Lich together.
---
A friend in my static literally targeted a wall on SH with it last week.
---
....yikes.
---
But it gets more expensive as you level. Just going to the nearest WP in Queensdale can be like 2s at lvl80. It's crazy when you think about how cheap it was when you were just starting out.
---
That's exactly one of points of why people are pushing for governments to get involved though. Games with loot box gambling (like Mario Kart Tour and Dr. Mario World) should not have an E rating.
---
You can play an elite spec mostly the same as core, depending on the class. Dagger/dagger thief, and dagger/dagger deadeye play almost exactly the same. Deadeye just changes the steal mechanic up to give you a small damage boost, but more importantly makes your stealth dagger attack do more damage than core.
---
So for thief, if you want to dagger/dagger, it makes zero sense to pick core. They play the same, just deadeye will do more damage.
---
The elite specs also add access to more weapons. In the case of Daredevil, it adds staff, which is objectively thief's best melee weapon. So Daredevil plays mostly nothing like core thief, outside of initiative still being your resource for using skills.
---
This is a big reason why people pick elite specs. Almost all the new weapon selections are good. Some classes use mainly just that weapon, other classes just use it as part of their rotation. Condi warrior, for example, torch isn't the best weapon they can use, but it's their best off hand for Condi damage. So it needs to be part of their rotation for them to maximize damage. Power warrior however, uses weapons core has access to, but works a lot like thief. The changes Berserker makes to the class, makes it just objectively more powerful than core.
---
A lot of the elite specs still make use what core can do. Soulbeast still uses greatsword in it's power build. It can use long bow as well, but long bow isn't great damage. The build is going to depend on the class. So Daredevil doesn't worry about core weapons really, but Berserker does.
---
Not as mysterious to me as your choice of items for your Shared Inventory Slots
---
There's an easy way to avoid waypoint cost.: Hoof it. I do it a lot
---
What responsibility are you implying the seller should have? To give away everything for free because otherwise gamers will get pissy? 
---
Its literally only a vocal minority of gamers that are incessantly complaining the second something costs them money and behaving as if selling things is inherently "anti-consumer" the second the business model doesn't follow the single model that a bunch of "get off my lawn" gamers have deemed is the only correct one, anything else being branded as some sort of terrible crime against human rights. 
---
Its impossible to take gamers and their exaggerations seriously a lot of the time.
---
&gt;No sunless/scion weps or infusions.
---
Wow what a surprise.......
---
:^)
---
I’m still waiting for someone to do Ancient Fairy Dragon from Yugioh
---
Someone with Experience in Path of Exile talk about it. I know the game is free to play and somehow every few months new stuff gets added into the game. Does this prove that people are happy to buy cosmetics if more and more content gets pumped into the game?
---
Thanks for the answer, will try reinstalling.
---
Please, you earn 2 gold just from daily. If 2 silver is too much for you, idk what you're doing.
---
So with your post, infusion drop rates are ~0.00003% on based on 93,143 coffers (wiki + your 20k).
---
Not you, op, but you do you, guys
---
If you have no self-control over your money spending habits and are incapable of making logical decisions for yourself (eg: is it worth it for me to spend $ on an in-game outfit?), then you only have yourself to blame.
---
Nothing in GW2 gemstore requires you to spend $, nor does it require you to purchase something to succeed at the game, where it gives you a clear advantage over someone else.
---
The your kids will be playing less and less video games, and then eventually none, becasue all games are going to "as a service" or "add ons and extras".
---
Have fun playing board games and chess.
---
Sure. I mean get away from things that also have a purpose as tools and back to games. 
---
Guess what, video games themselves can be and are damaging. Anti-lootbox people are literally creating an argument that supports the abolishment of video games as a whole and they aren't smart enough to even realise it. 
---
And you will have a hard time convincing people that someone spending too much money on lootboxes is somehow worse than people literally dying at their keyboards from emaciation because they got so addicted to video games.
---
Obscuring the issue by framing it as the company simply "selling something" is disingenuous.  I bet you have a future in the nicotine industry.
---
So you would play another game, since no such guarantee exists.  See: wild star
---
man they really Need that loot overhaul
---
What class did you choose?

Viel Erfolg, habe meine Antworten auch hinterlegt :)

Auch noch zur Sprache: es wurde nur nach Text und nicht nach Audio gefragt - diese sind bei mir auch unterschiedlich eingestellt. (Text: DE; Audio: EN [Das Voiceacting ist einfach besser!])

Well seeing as how buy to play has been Anet's business model since 2005 and its worked for them so far whereas lets see Aion subscription had to go free to play, LOTRO subscription now free to play and these were good games. Only WoW and Final Fantasy have survived with sub models. Buy to play doesn't make the game feel like a commitment that you have to log in every single day just to get you money's worth of the £10 you are spending on the game monthly. Instead I can log into GW2 once a day during dragon bash and get my daily done, do the beetle time trail then log out till the next day and not be punished. If I wanted to I could stop playing GW2 till the next living world is released and I won't feel I need to log in because I'm paying monthly for it. B2P is a good model it gives you flexibility. Lets take another example your computer stops working any you haven't got the money to pay for it. GW2s model allows it so that you don't have to keep paying that £10 every month instead you can put that towards getting a new computer or whatever piece your computer needs. If you want to pay monthly go to Final Fantasy or WoW. GW and GW2 have survived on the B2P model since 2005 its just taking MMOs a while to catch up.
---
Spyro's dad :D
---
You're welcome to do so but core necro is probably the worst class in the game. Necro starts being relevant after lvl 80 with elite specialisations.
---
I recently started playing gw2.My friend told me about it and so I decided to try it.And I couldn't believe how good this game is.Its been like 3 months from when I started playing it and now I have lvl 80 char and I would like to continue with the story because it's very interesting.I hope I get the key so I can play with my friend because this is the best game ever.
---
I wasn't all that impressed with Heavensward.  Shadowbringers was better, but still not fantastic.  I am liking Stormblood so far but I imagine that will probably fall apart too.  To be honest that might be because I have a really hard time keeping interested in any story where the dialogue isn't 90-100% voiced.  TBH of all MMOs I have played I would rank SW:ToR as the top story (for some of the classes at least) and ESO second.  
---
If I had to pick an ideal MMO, it would be GW2s Combat and Movement (not just mounts, but gliding and jumping as well, as jumping in GW2 is more precise than nearly any MMO ever and I really love the exploration) and dye system, BDOs character creator ONLY, FFXIVs screenshot/camera system and maaaaybe boss design, inside of ESO for nearly everything else... story, setting, armor and weapon aesthetics, housing, sneak and thievery/assassination system, 100% voiced character dialogue, add-on support, RP friendliness... just everything.
---
Just wait till you find all the jumping puzzles.....
---
There isn’t an arrow around my skill slot and I can’t change the healing ability like when I’m just doing missions and stuff like that
---
It definitely took me less days than the "real thing" in game :D
---
Ah okay thank you I’ll try that later on, thank you
---
How something can be a failure that works?
---
Does it work? So it's not a failure.
---
See, whole dairy products business is a failure that works ONLY because people buy dairy products.
---
See irony here?
---
literally any, but many people do the shortest/most popular. Do fractal dailies+recommended. Also specific  LS3/4 map currencies drop them on harvest
---
Thx
---
Yeah, probably but still..
---
How did you extracted this model though?
---
That would be a fun idea, but I don't think my printer would be able to make a sturdy enough version. At least not with PLA filament. And the model would need to simplified. Like the locks on the sides removed. And I don't think I could paint a much smaller version.
---
So, I gotta beat anet to legendary keychain merchandise I guess.
---
Dropped yer nose ^
---
I didn't use the model, I recreated it in blender.
---
Here are some more posts about it.

How about: "The drop rate is really really low!!"
---
No, they could not remain in their form.  The form was time limited to 60 seconds, for both you and the NPCs.  The only two norn who ever remained in their animal form were trapped that way, one by Jormag's corruption and the other is in GW2 and we are not certain why they are stuck in bear form beyond "it's funny" that people keep caging him and confusing him for a talking bear.  The implication, though, is a bit like animorphs... stay transformed too long and you get stuck that way forever.... or "if you keep making that face it will freeze that way".
---
Appealing to hardcore players basically never works out. You will never meet the pace they complete new content at with designing new and unique encounters. They'll beat it and then move on. If you try to cater to the hardcore without proper care for your casual players, the game is much more likely to suffer as a result.
---
The only "gain" I could see from this kind of appeal would be towards streamers serving as promoters as psuedo-marketing, but that is a very fickle pursuit. They would be better off investing in more traditional marketing campaigns.
---
Im not getting my hopes up, i know intel is still better and gw is really badly optimized in crowded fights. Im simply curious on how it does, how big is the difference with different mobos, ram speeds etc.

We should probably remember that in the last 250 years since GW1 the humans eradicated the Tengu to near extinction in Cantha and THAT is why they are hiding behind their walls... they have no reason to trust allowing humans in their lands because the last time that happened the Emperor of Cantha went genocidal.
---
I get a slight tic every time I log in and see those on my bar.
---
"really really **really** low"
---
Soo... you didn't play EotN then?
---
some benchmarks show  new amd procs be better than intel even in single core heav games
---
Asuran, I like the very snarky, competitive, logic focused culture that they have, the fact that the Inquest is a big part of their society makes it all the more interesting.
---
I was under the impression that AMDs single core performance at this point was somewhere between 90 to 95 percent that of Intel's single core performance. Depends on the individual game of course and I haven't seen any benchmarks for GW2 specifically.
---
If anet puts some effort and gets on the viking hype trains with some norn stuff and latch onto the google searches with it they could get some exposure. Vikings is ending soon, vinland just dropped but after people will look for their viking fix. I remember watching Black sails and then after searching stuff found Black flag, but the thing is i can't get my pirate fix, no more series or games that look good.

EposVox did some streaming tests with the new Ryzen (and a couple other) CPUs in GW2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY2fbAzFiUE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=910
---
Not really useful to judge pure gaming performance but maybe interesting for some of you.
---
Fair enough, great work nonetheless
---
“Lootboxes are gambling” =/= “all lootboxes should be banned forever.” 
---
There are plenty of instances of legal gambling, but they’re regulated—kept out of the hands of children (who have poor impulse control and less understanding of consequences), required to be transparent in their mechanics and odds, and subject to impartial oversight and audits to make sure they’re not rigged. The video game industry super does not want that because compliance (especially age-verification compliance) costs money, and having to tell people that there’s only a one in 100,000 chance they’ll get that special drop (rather than just calling it “super rare”) makes them less likely to pony up... but overall some of those requirements would make things better for all of us.
---
So.. It's gonna take 8 months for a new expansion?
---
I was talking about removing the cost.
---
Just wear a glove and pretend your hand has the draw effect.
---
Only use stealth when called for... also all the other kits are reveals (light and lightning field respectively).
---
Sooo you ONLY use stealth when it’s called for by coms... otherwise more then likely someone is revealed or using a skill that causes reveals.
---
Also awhile ago they nerfed the stealth so it’s not as good if you don’t “stack” the buff (simultaneously together). That’s how you get real “time” in stealth so you can portal bomb or whatever your tactics.
---
Scrapper your main job is to heal and condi cleans so just do that and it’s all good :)
---
And whatever you have, it will always feel like a potato? (In certain situations?)
---
Logans Pact from the gemstore.
---
Sure, I don’t mind at all (or can’t really stop you, lol). I’m not sure if the gloves are or not, I haven’t checked in awhile.
---
Dragon Fireworks, from the BLC
---
Thanks!
---
EotN was an uneasy and temporary alliance that for all we know lasted a week. It was handled really well imo and the interactions were interesting. It's not like Gwen and Pyre became besties by the end, and 99.9% of Charr did remain hostile. It did justice to both sides whilst introducing a new angle. 
---
For GW2 this development happens off screen and we're just told to roll with it. I can count on one hand how many times Charr acted even a tiny bit hostile towards humans outside the Ascalon starting zones, it's just not believable in the slightest. That's what I'm talking about when I say they've been watered down too much. What's the difference between 2 humans or 1 human and 1 charr interacting? Nothing. They have different vice actors, that's it. Anet has discarded every bit of conflict or race identity that doesn't serve a purpose in a war with the dragons.
---
|Man i can't decide on any class anymore. Everything seems soo cool! I decided not to boost yet cuz i wanna get through the core game then go to pof! I still can't decide what to play! Im deciding on thief or revenant. I heard thief is not that good like its getting nerfed hard. So i guess revenant? Man im so confused what to do everything looks good! 
---
Thief is fine.  It's not going anywhere.  It's actually in the best spot it has been in the game for a long time.  Don't listen to the naysayers.  It's a good fun class to play, and takes a lot of skill to truly master.  I am a thief main since launch.
---
Thank you for the correction. Loved animorphs too btw
---
None. Gizmos are not cool.
---
I played this game about 6 years ago, I've returned to it every now and then but have recently decided to play it again and just completed the map 100%. I'd love to play the expansion as I truly enjoy the game and would love to see what the rest of Tyria has to offer and grind out those legendary weapons :).
---
Find a new player and play with them for a bit.  I find this often rekindles that spirit in me, by vicariously absorbing the excitement of the new player.
---
How big are the pigeons where you live?
---
That’s Aurora, the legendary trinket.
---
It would mean so much to have the dlc for the game that is invaluable to me 🤗
---
You can also make a pretty good archangel with one of the wing sets HoMM 3 for life!
---
Didn't say impossible. 
---
You also can't ignore the sheer amount of people flat out refusing to pay for a sub or games in general branding it "not worth it".
---
lamo
---
Well, time to join the fun!! I was directed here by my coworkers as guild wars slowly become our office’s offline culture. I used to be a huge mmo player on wow, so it seems like a good time to get back into action. Playing a thief as my main and seems to meet a little glass ceiling with specing and builds, hopefully the HoT expac can help me a little☺️
---
dont play bro it's easy that whining on reddit
---
LMAO
---
I'm a human engineer / holosmith.  So far I've mostly done story, the mount quests, bounty trains, and a little fractaling.  Still trying to figure out the best way to spend my time and money in the game.  Knowing that fractals are probably very interesting is helpful.
---
If we're talking actual 'Gizmos' then I'd recommend https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mystic_Chromatic_Ooze. I particular enjoy getting some of the high-end infusions that play around with character detail, this mystic chromatic ooze is achieved by doing the colossus precursor collection (don't have to finish the whole thing), and is basically the whole reason why I even did this collection, the disclaimer to this is you have to re-apply once every 5 minutes if you want to keep the shiny effect. But imo, was worth :)
---
Awesome! Just need a big, shadowy foam finger now to complete the look.
---
I never seem to learn my lesson. First with trick-or-treat bags and now these.
---
Just basing off of the current drop rates, at 10 million coffers, you should have a 100x drop increase to ~0.003% to get one, instead of 0.00003%.
---
Don't expect it to be like WoW. Take you time, learn the game, DON'T RUSH. Other than that enjoy.
---
Except you don't get that, you just instead just get told off for being petty and irritable.
---
Games with subs don't necessarily do well either.  ESO didn't so as well when it had a sub, and ended up going free to play with an optional sub. SWToR ended up laying off half it's staff only a year or so after launch, lost the sub and ended up free to play. A sub not only guarantees nothing, but also makes it harder for a company to attract players. There are plenty of people playing this game because there's no sub.
---
The optional sub route itself is fraught with issues, because there's the whole slippery slope issue. In some games, like SWTOR, if you're going to seriously play the game (as opposed to just playing through the story), you're going to have to sub.
---
Every single MMORPG has complaints on the forums. Every MMORPG has people leaving them game because they feel the developer has dropped the ball in one way or another. Even popular games like FF XIV (which has a sub) loses people because they don't like one thing or another.  Same with ESO with it's optional sub.
---
You probably think the stuff cut from HOT would have made HoT better, but there's no actual guarantee of that. Stuff is cut from movies and books all the time, and very often those cuts make the product better, not worse. 
---
Money doesn't guarantee stuff to be released on time either, nor does it guarantee that things will come out better or faster. Hiring more devs, for example, could slow down releases. 
---
I just think you're making a lot of unjustified assumptions here.
---
I’d love any new playable race but really it just be for fashion wars. 
---
There’s no real purpose for races other than flavor. Which is why it probably and sadly will never happen. As they said before, they would feel obligated to include new starter zones, new stater quests, and record new voice dialogue for EVERY story element with voice acting. That’s the biggest hang up of them all because they’d need both male and female voices plus whatever other languages they use for localization in the game. 
---
That’s just too much work and resources for fashion wars.
---
Of course that’s BS. I’d be happy without updating those voice acting elements. I’d be happy with just text that I’d skip anyways.  Just use the voice acting going forward. I’d also be happy if they didn’t feel “obligated “ to maintain the same stater formula they used for the other races and tried something different.
---
Convert cores into lodestones, some are profitable.  This is a very tedious way to do it though.
---
The threshold for phasing the boss requires the power dps to be ridiculously high though. It's much more than most people think and most 100/99cm pugs below 250kp would be better off with condi because their phases on stuff like skorvald and siax are often much longer than 5 and even 10 seconds.
---
Try axe/axe and greatsword with warrior. Its a really fun combo, axe/axe has insane damage and it looks amazing on my giant norn warrior.
---
Dont listen to anyone (including me) just do what you want and explore.
---
Any chance of you sharing or selling the STL?
---
This game is neither Guild Wars 1 nor WoW, though it contains some elements from each. If you come in expecting either game, you're going to end up disappointed. 
---
That said, this game is a good game in it's own right. 
---
The combat is more active than in Guild Wars 1 or WoW, which is mostly static combat. Very often in those games you can't cast while moving for example and neither game has an active dodge. 
---
Guild Wars 1 wasn't at true MMO, but it was more of a lobby game. In that way at least, this game is more like WoW, in that it has a world were you can run into other players while playing, not just in towns and outposts. But unlike WoW, the world is still broken into zones with portals between them.
---
The skills work differently than either Guild Wars 1 or WoW. 
---
There's no real disadvantage btw of playing any race/class combo you want.
---
You will be overwhelmed.
---
First.
---
So take your time to follow the path you want to follow. Don't try to do everything at the same time. Take it easy in your first few days. You'll probably find people everywhere ready to help you. Ask. And that's it. (-:
---
I was running GS mesmer for leveling then switched to the staff/staff mirage build on metabattle. Running the axe version right now. The staff build is crazy tanky, you can hop right into pof/hot packs with zero worry of dying. Solo champs too. The caveat is that it's a fair bit slower than the axe version.
---
It's less about buggy games in the indie scene and more about just straight up garbage games.
---
gw2 does not play like gw1
---
take your time and explore. there is no right/wrong race/class combination.
---
if you feel like rushing to level cap (which I don't recommend), focus on running events that pop up on the map rather than completing the heart hubs across a map
---
this subreddit is laced with salt so keep that in mind
---
You will need to buy the living story seasons to know wtf is happening from vanilla into heart of thorns
---
Aside from "LFG", the subreddit has "do not post to look for / advertise a guild" in both the rules and the report options - what makes looking "for people to play with" by listing all of one's info different?
---
If a group is asking for power then no. Otherwise you can run whatever, there's plenty of groups with no class requirements or people that join those.
---
Fill all your character slots ASAP. Look at all the little icons at the top of the screen. Try everything.
---
Count me in for 1!
---
\&gt; I'm a **french Canadian**. Sorry. 
---
Seems Canadian to me...  
---
To make the game interesting, start looking for some goals (legendaries, achievements, etc), and research on how to get there, lots of good guides among wiki, youtube, streamers, dulfy (where is she!?!?).
---
Find a guild that is active at the same time as you and likes to do things that you like (open world pve, instanced pve, pvp, wvw)  
---
Use the lfg, but understand that there are good and bad apples everywhere...
---
Um do you misstake me with someone else? Why would i be botherd about a meteor shower?
---
Not really, it's same like before.
---
Ah yes, this bug. Rev has had this bug since launch, so welcome and have a drink. You’ll be here awhile.
---
You are truly one sophisticated person. Above all us plebs, for sure.
---
That... wasn’t what I expected
---
I don't need a key for myself but I'd love one for my mate so he'd get back into the game.
---
Yeah, reporting the exploit itself isn't going to get anyone's account gimped, fairly low chance of it happening but even then a possibility is still one despite how slim your pickings are, but generally speaking, the exploits you mentioned did get fixed as those content typically are permanent additions to the game unlike these temporary events that we're unlikely to ever see again. Like AB multimap wasn't much of an exploit for the meta itself but the map hopping mechanic brought about by megaservers, the perma TP to friend was basically flawed from the start with its character-bound cooldowns that let people make and delete alts.
---
But yeah, not saying that they're going to get banned or suspended or that reporting the exploit would have ANet actually do anything, but its still good practice to report the exploits.
---
Do yourself a favour and grab at least the copper-fed salvage machine if you can. I appreciate the cleanliness of your inventory, that said. I'm eternally 40/90 on every alt for various reasons.
---
My commander is a mordremvari and id love to have her look the part in game!
