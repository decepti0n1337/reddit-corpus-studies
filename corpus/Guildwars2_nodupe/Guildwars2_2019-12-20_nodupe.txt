And the example is: " *Dude, you've spent like* [***400***](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=400) *bucks on this game so you can beat everyone who hasn't spent* [***any money***](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=any%20money)*.* [***Pay-to-win***](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Pay-to-win) *noob!* "

you dont get one up on anyone or unbalance the game with the kind of rewards you get form the cash shop in gw2.

---
---
The real fuckup here is all the wasted man hours on "side projects*. They spent years trying to develop multiple games which never saw the light of day in any manner whatsoever. None of them got far along enough to show the public anything.

Mike Z has not worked at ArenaNet for two months.

bad
---
Do you have to log in on a character or just log in?
---
I understand, I was just hoping for a brighter future. But, as you say it's still huge, and it's not like Guild Wars has been shut down, so I doubt GW2 will be anytime soon.
---
I don't think new elite specs are even necessary. Just new weapons. Let us play with old niches and themes in new ways.
---
Although it's extremely unlikely that it will cost you that much, your post highlights how predatory RNG cash shop purchases are. They exist to obfuscate the true cost of an item and steal extra money people with addictive tendencies.
---
No one gives a shit about WVW players, stfu
---
Really looking forward to it.
---
Those are actually the two I play heavily, but I have done 95%+ of both and I was looking for something with a bit more sense of wonder/noob experience.
---
I would doubt any major sales any time soon, most I would expect is something like the $10 off they recently did but even then that's the same price as official retailers like [DLGamer at $20](https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-path-of-fire-43807).
---
Same. Figured end of 2019 and hitting 41k AP was a good time to call it.
---
No alliances in sight, LS first episode disappointing with 10 min afk meta, gemstore everything etc. 
---
Took a lot for me to drop GW2, if you could "complete" GW2 I definitely had a complete account. All legendaries, all wardrobe unlocks, 96% skins unlocked, 41k AP etc.
---
That's how fed up I was finally was.
---
May new xpac save us all üôè
---
The condi/quickness build is bad and shouldn't be suggested at all. It's better to gear the full dps version and swap out 2 things  (food/sigent/gear/sigil) and cover quickness *or* if you have a chrono just use the DPS gear setup.
---
Based on what you said I'd recommend firebrand (guardian elite specialization) as your main. Healing firebrand is extremely powerful on many bosses, offers reflects when required, has plenty of blocks which can carry many mechanics, huge raw healing, multiple CC skills and very solid boon uptime. Can even provide permanent quickness to 1 subgroup. All these things make it so powerful, it's even used by most fractal groups (except for top tier hardcore players, who don't require its healing and instead pick the damage variant).  
---
Condi firebrand build is also extremely strong, arguably so much so it could be played on every boss with decent efficiency. It also has somewhat good power damage (for a condi build), which makes it decently strong in fractals as well. Honestly, unless you go for absolutely crazy top tier strats, firebrand (healing and condi) will be perfectly sufficient for all raids and all fractals and even if you wanna be absolutely optimal, it will be good for most bosses and very close to optimal on the rest.
---
You dont owe anyone anything. You just need to stop leaving snarky comments to everyone that says anything positive. TLDR: stop being toxic.
---
Healing in fractals means [firebrand](https://discretize.eu/builds/guardian/heal-firebrand) or [renegade](https://discretize.eu/builds/revenant/heal-renegade) (note that fractal builds get free stats from the potions and agony resist later on and have different cap points, if you want to use them in raids as well follow the raid builds and just be a little over cap in fractals). Both [firebrand](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/firebrand/condition/) and [renegade](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/revenant/renegade/condition/) have good condi DPS builds, if I had to pick one I would say firebrand. That gives you the option to go condi/quickness when you have a chrono (aka don't gear the specific solo quickness version) *or* if you wanted to swap a couple things and still run it solo.
---
Try it and u Will Find out. üëç
---
I mean, that depends, what is it hyped up to be?
---
In general, why don't you just try out the game for free? No one can really tell you how your experience will be
---
https://welcome.guildwars2.com/en/play-for-free
---
I am trying it. Thats why i said i was new. Downloading it and waiting. Reviews are good saying its the best mmorpg. Just wanted some more info from here. But i guess it was too much to ask.
---
Break it down: you don't need to do it all at once. 
---
Pick activities that hit multiple things at once, like doing adventures in AB while waiting for Octovine, do octovine, loot. Boom, several thousand HoT exp, maybe mastery points. Focus on basics first (characters with elites, then gear in the order of exo, ascended, then legendaries.)
---
In this game you can do a _lot_ of things for some kind of progress, so just keep reminding yourself: you're doing something every time you even just complete your dailies (2g, 10 ap, whatever else you get from the boxes) and finish out your daily ascended crafts.
---
Anthem was mismanaged from the very start.
---
Sorry, wasn't trying to be aggressive about that
---
It's probably the best casual MMO on the market, but whether you can claim it to be the best MMO is a little harder to say, depending on what your interests are. That being said, with no subscription fee, and the ability to jump in and jump out whenever and never feel like you're years behind everyone else is personally an amazing feeling
---
So what you get out of this game can largely depend on what you're looking for. If you're looking for a game with constant hardcore updates, massive raids and gear grind, then this probably isn't what you're looking for.
---
But if you're more on the casual side, ranging from the mildly casual (dabbles in hardcore content without necessarily prioritizing it) and the √ºber casual (what's hardcore?), then you're likely going to have a great time
---
Woot! Can‚Äôt wait to be a BS again! DPS warrior is just so bad for high ping players what with all the easy accidental cancelling of stacking modifiers.
---
Subreddits in general can be a shitty place to ask people about their thoughts on a game. This is a place for people to vent endlessly about their bitterness or share silly stuff they like such as fanart.
---
Anyways, it is a good game especially for a new player. It has gone through some rough times this year especially and a lot of people are unsure it will recover, but there's also ~7 years of updates available to new players to enjoy and it's definitely still an actively played game.
---
They did, thats what Fractals are. When something sucks, and you already have a better replacement, the solution isnt to spend time working on the previous system (That is so fundamentally flawed that fixing it requires reworking the entire thing from ground up) only to turn it into a copy of what you already have anyway, but to just drop it.
---
State what info u looking for.
---
I play DC Universe online. I like the casual game play where i can play my missions at my own pace. I like customizable characters and accessories. If i get to playing it then I hope I like it. I always have an open mind about things
---
Is it an open world where they just drop you somewhere and give you missions?
---
Nice video! For reference, what's your latency like?
---
Man do those rose-tinted glasses come with a side-dose of crack? 
---
GW1 prophecies was such a cluster-fucked mess of a story that it would make living world season 3 seem like it had sensible transitions. Factions was cool in terms of the conflict itself but the premise that caused it was massively stupid before we knew about Abaddon (so Shiro went nuts because. . . some fortune teller told him? For real?). Nightfall was probably their high-point of story, which probably fed into why PoF and Season 4 were pretty good for the most part.
---
Very likely you'll enjoy GW2 then.
---
Given that the elite specs so far have invalidated old specs, or used a central theme that was a retread of older ones, yeah, its pretty hard. People have given "advice" in the sense that you get "advice" from some rambling lunatic on the street. Which is to say, made without experience to how the whole thing works, a basic foundation to work off of and wild jumps between points.
---
They never said easier, they said to make up time.
---
Guild Wars 2 is ultimately a commercial enterprise and requires a good flow of income to sustain its hardworking developers and pay for other overheads.
---
If you enjoy the game, do buy some gems or gift others some BL items this season and support Anet's bottomline. 
---
May not be the most heartfelt way to show support, but it's a practical way of showing appreciation.
---
What's the error message you get?
---
I think people dismissed Kotaku for pure speculation. 
---
I'm skeptical whether massively got their info from a company source or simply copied Kotaku.
---
oh you can count on anything being the same except gemstore, that will be updated always
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
^(though I know you meant it as a state of gemstore)
---
Haven't played those, my main MMORPG experience before GW2 was free Asian MMOs between 2004-2011 xd
---
it's in players hands because only we can financially support these great devs by buying gemstore items which will surely get reflected in the upcoming content and not only in more gemstore items ^(/s)
---
Nice! Thanks
---
Wow thats a lot of stuff i did not understand lol. Thanks for some info. When i finally get it, it will probably make sense.
---
Honestly, I‚Äôd almost rather just have a BS without banners than take another clueless pug dps and have to deal with everyone arguing about who‚Äôs going to do the mechanics, carry the CC, kill anamolies, etc...:P
---
Not without banners they aren‚Äôt, lol.
---
Fittingly, they‚Äôre the dps class that tanks the hardest in the absence of banner buffs.
---
You have to log in on a character.
---
I swear all of this speculation towards GW3 Is going to result in tons of heartbreak.  I‚Äôd love a quality sequel as much as anyone else (I‚Äôve been waiting. Since GW1 because GW2 was anything but quality) but I hope you guys realize it‚Äôs really unlikely/:
---
This isn't a speculation thread
---
I don't understand why Anet wasn't working on the next xpac after they launched PoF.  I'm really confused about why they only recently realized we wanted another expansion and we are disappointed we didn't get one.  Didn't they say they have teams set up so that one team is always at work on the next project. Idk man, i'm just baffled at them being baffled. But this still my favorite game so I'm not going anywhere. Anet, you have my full attention. Make something and I'll spend my money on it.
---
They made Balthazar evil AND killed off joko the baddest character in the series. Fuck this game story they fail at every opportunity plus it's pc sjw cucky shit lol
---
Well, try this: go to the event page that I mentioned, and look up the four world bosses I mentioned.  I think one of those events happens every 30 minutes.  Find the nearest one (in location and time), and explore the maps until you find where it happens (click on the name in the event page to learn more about the boss, such as where it is).  When the event happens, there will be a lot of people also doing that event, and so it doesn't matter if you're a level 1 or whatever.  You might die, but you'll have fun dying.  :-)
---
tbh bringing a bannerslave into 5man content is allready debatable; they're great for boonstrip, CC and those buffs they provide... but in encountern where you need neither of that they're useless and only looked for because of their unique buffs!
---
now that their banners were gone there was like no reason at all to bring a bannerslave, their dps is shitty and comparable to a quickbrand support.
---
not bashing warriors tho, imo they kinda need a buff or those nerfs to their banners reworked etc.
---
It's not speculation for GW3 on the horizon. I was shocked to hear it was even being planned because I recall them saying they are GW2 going for another 10 years. I was asking if the comments in this article were fabricated because I never believed GW3 was on the cards.
---
I've also got this head cannon where my warrior is a war priest of Balthazar who is destined to replace Balthazar. Works better imo than a rando guy who just happens to be far too good at annihilating everything that stands in his way. My next goal is to beat balthazar with this guy and get the "Who needs a magic sword?" achievement.
---
Yeah, it's a good moment but it hurts when you compare it to just how much flavor Salads got in HoT. 
---
I haven't played *Bound By Blood* with a Charr yet but I hope it's more HoT than PoF in that regard
---
I mean " worse than optimal" isn't necessarily a reason not to be one. Maybe people like playing it.
---
They only said it was another project. Potentially Guild Wars related. I think they maybe did say GW3. But they didn't say that as fact. They shouldn't put such conjecture (anything that starts with possibly, or maybe) in the article in the first place, but I feel that people misread that as being stated as fact when it really was not.
---
The other day I was doing the JP side by side with some rando the whole way through, like jump for jump we went at max speed through it, and the when we got to that part, he just yeeted right into the snowboulder and got annihilated.  
---
I thought he had a stroke irl or something... Glad to know it‚Äôs a thing and he was just trying to do this,
---
I would look further into warriors if I were you. I can only assume you have built these opinions on experiences with warriors that don't show anything other than banners, cc and boonstip (why would warr boonstrip when renegade can easily do it instead?). But warriors can dish out great damage and banners are an amazing stat boost - not having them is like not having food+util in terms of stat comparison.   
---
Also idk what your expectations of firebrands are but they should indeed be around the warriors dmg in a proper group - though both of their numbers should be nice and 70%+ of a dedicated dps.
---
Sadness.  Still no Glyph of Reaping in home instances fix.
---
Dude... I'm not starting a fight here or anything but I just read trough your essay and by the end I really wanted to punch you right trough your crybaby face.
---
Let me explain.
---
You posted this as a long time GW fan and I understand its hard for you to play the game so much and keep getting your hopes let down by the devs. On the other side you have the devs who pour 8 hours **every** day into making this game alive.
---
They read reddit, play wvw, sit in LA and read map chat. Any way they look,  even tough there is a HUGE amount of respect and support, the thing they see the most is this shit. We all know that the thing that fucks with your mind the most  is someone calling you a fucking dissapointment and never accepting you no matter what you do to please them. All Im saying is what someone wiser then me told me. If you have nothing to say that hasnt been said already, ur better of not saying anything. Or something like that. 
---
 Imagine ur parent or teacher reminded u every day that what u do sucks no matter how much u try.
---
The thing is, lots of people are gonna read your post and others just like it and think nothing good has happened to the game, when in reality the devs have really put in a ton of hard work. Worst of all a dev is gonna read it and have it buzz around his head the next day and the one after that cuz this shits personal to them man, just like it is to some of us.
---
You cant expect them to put out content on the same frequency as bigger game devs when there is so much work across all parts of the game. They are building the game for the future, step by step, old parts needed re-building while new parts needed to be invented.
---
 Even if they felt motivated and so happy to work on a title of this magnitude, sooner or later they start to belive the words that print onto their brain and loose focus and desire to work on things they imagined at the begining... With every good move they make they get love from one part of the community and compleatly  spitt on by the other. They dont want to AND cant afford to ignore wvw or pvp or raiders or living worlders. So they try to please us all but with the size of the studio they just can't make it happen because the game is huuge.
---
 
---
They work really hard to make the game better and u can see every patch notes there are lots of QoL improvements and i think they see the bigger picture.
---
The move with the strike missions is kind of smart in a way. PvE player base is rly split into two main parts, as i said, raiders and living worlders so this could be an attempt of merging. Gently introducing LW-ers into raid-like content. Who knows what will happen, I just think they need a  supporting work environment  and some time to make this game what it can be, i really belive in that. I just think that the  people who played the game so much over the years could really make the job easier in some aspects by working along side with Anet and give them their ideas and insight. Most of all I think modding support for 3rd party addons would be accepted very well.  Like, anet... Cmon, let people help you do the things you dont have time for right now. I know its impossible but this game would be so good in a open source-like scenario. 
---
Here are sime ideas: 
---
Make custom 1v1 and 2v2 pvp and wvw tournaments a thing. Just make a UI like a  lobby where ppl join and randomly make them fight for the prize of the sum of entry fees.
---
PvP and WvW is a huge potential...
---
 -Imagine events like vanilla/hot/pof builds only, 
---
 -  siege weapon events where ppl fight on huge range with siege weapons (west-east castles on server borders while having scouts for navigation and different objectives to win)
---
 - Organised fasion wars, and so much more.
---
Organize famous players to get people moving and do stuff together like this.
---
**Support community competative raid runs** i hope u watched that raid tournament  mightyteapot and guys hosted! Holy crap that was awesome. We need more stuff like that. Thats what brings more people to the game and makes current players busy while u work your plans out. 
---
Encourage players to do stuff they like, and money will come with time. 
---
To the players - Remember guys, we are all on the same side here... Dont make it a civil war.
---
Meh, I‚Äôm just really against micro transactions so I‚Äôll eat the downvotes.  Fair is fair, yeah?
---
That is true, that the carrot shouldn't be the whole game. On the other hand people always say they want carrot. They want to increase the level cap, make more gear stats to grind for. That is simply the life of an MMO.
---
But I have to also say, have you seen other game out there? Some games are introducing sticks to punish not playing. And I feel that is starting to get out of hand. Limited time events with exclusive rewards that will forever be gone. Seasons passes, that if you don't play religiously, you loose out. You can even loose out on things even if you paid money for the season pass. These sticks, I feel, can harm even games with good gameplay. Destiny 2, and their current release models, I am very weary of at this time, even as an avid shooter fan. Didn't fill a meter in time? Well now it is gone, and you don't even get to put a check mark there ever again. Their current way of telling a story is literally season 1 of GW2...
---
Since season 1, GW2, has consistently moved further and further from sticks and time exclusive progress, like season passes or one time systems that encourage even more problematic game-play behaviors in people. The team said they didn't want to introduce temporary content. So, there is really no content that must be done now, that can't be saved for later. Even, holiday events, now, have been set up to say, well if you really can't come to progress you collections right now, you can come back next year.
---
So i think GW2 is doing a good job of not demanding the player to grind out progress day in and out. Of course there are the impatient. But at least the game itself is patient and doesn't take away progress.
---
Read it if you want, spread the word and we shall flourish or dont i dont care anymore way too high
---
Really well articulated points. Arenanet innovate. Sometimes that innovation hinders their progress unfortunately. But they do push the envelope on this genre and I'd be curious to see what they would do next. That said, GW2 can still achieve a lot more and I want to see the storybreach it's conclusion. I hope they can turn thisnaroubd next year.
---
1 day, 8 hours even!
---
No normally I don't specify the auth server at all. Are you on NA or EU btw? I think this is only happening on EU servers.
---
Anet couldn't even deliver gw2 patch properly. How dare they thought about gw3 lul.  
---
Btw New World &gt; Gw3
---
I completed that meta achievement without that event and finished vision 3 weeks ago
---
CMs when talking about fractals are the challenge modes of the tier 99 and 100 fractals that are a bit harder (= more challenging) than the normal mode counterparts
---
Bookahs familiar with my thinking have told me I agree with you.
---
I would argue that the end of this LS will be the deciding factor. If nothing significant or important happens or is announced then yea, I would say its done since that would have been 3 LS in a row with no significant change.
---
After playing gw2 for 3 years straight, without any other games, Ice Brood and Anet‚Äôs stupid decision to make the game more about gems than actual content made me quit. I started BFA and even if the combat and general play style is different in wow (plus the gear grind) they offer a lot of content. I spend 13 euro per month on the sub, that would be a min of 7 euros less than what I was spending in gems in gw2. Content is a huge huge problem and I fear the game will go into gw1 mode in the next year. Only a complete revamp of the game would change it, revamp that would actually take into account player feedback. Its a shame actually the lore offers so many possibilities but alas, anet is like a rock: fixed and cold to outside words :(
---
Please consult your devs if you have a banner lasting more than 4 hours.
---
It isn't really. There's some flavor text for Charr, a little bit more depending on your Legion (e.g., if you're Blood Legion then Bangar will speak to you as if you're familiar with Grothmar), and a single achievement ("Meet Your Imperator", 0 AP).
---
But what's really noticeable is that while some characters react to *you* differently, a Charr character doesn't really take the situation differently. It leaves you feeling a little detached - not getting into the festivities, or having any insight into the situation, than any other race character.
---
&gt; As Arenanet doesn't really update WvW in a meaningful way, player count fell, eventually making EotM "useless" in its intended purpose.
---
It was useless for this purpose when it came out as que's stopped being a problem months before it's release
---
&gt;"Who needs a magic sword?" achievement.
---
I did it with my Charr. I felt I had something to prove concerning my race and magical swords..

Hey everyone, So i picked up this game a few days ago. I think about a week. Currently i am a Free to play user, Meaning i don't have access to PoF or HoT which means no revenant among other things. Currently i have a level 65 thief. But i am not sure this is where i will settle. The classes i've played so far are as follows. Necromancer, Thief Both of which were played into the 60s.
---
I will spend most of my time in spvp or WvW i love pvp a great deal. I am an offensive player, I don't tend to support much, Though that doesn't mean i am opposed to it as every group that is successful has one. I primarily get my fun from killing other players, The more at once the more fun i have i also love to one shot people from no where. However i don't wanna be a pushover in terms of getting caught and killed without a being able to fight back.
---
From what i can tell a lot of people say thief is hard to kill due to cloak, Though after playing one to 65 i have basically spammed repeater from the dual pistols weapon bar for 59 levels. The thief feels crazy spammy but i can't really argue with the results truth be told. However compared to my necro there is a lot of content i couldn't do with him because he was just to squishy and couldn't sustain himself. I did read that the Engineer is very strong and durable is this true? I know from reading that one of the more sought after dps professions is the holosmith. Even if it is complex i don't mind learning to play it. Also it doesn't hurt that they make things explode.
---
Those are the only ones i can really find on the suggestions of premade articles. Can i get some insight or more suggestions so i can have better information to go on than stuff from several years ago.
---
Just got home and have been thinking about what you wrote for a while. I think I really see what you mean now. The examples you provide are very helpful in showing your points and letting me shift perspective to understand. 
---
I think where I misunderstood was that when you talk about struggles, you're talking about actual physical threats to staying alive, like making sure you can eat, have a place to live, and all the things you describe... which are definitely the sorts of shared experiences that only people of the same wealth class will understand.
---
I definitely agree there. There is no way that a billionaire and I would be able to get on the same page as far as survival and necessities. Very much like that gif of ['what could a banana even cost, 10 dollars?'](https://media.giphy.com/media/yJu2jIQZgPubm/giphy.gif).
---
&gt;What do you have in common with him? Pretty sure he didn't have to work, help his parents work, worry about heat, nessecities, and I'm pretty sure you didn't live in a massive mansion with endless tutors and all your wants constantly fufilled. Those sound like completely different life experiences with practically nothing in common.
---
What we'd have in common would be our views on family and social obligation versus self--internal and emotional struggles rather than physical ones. The rich guy might not get why I'm staying in a bedroom that's 20 degrees because it snowed earlier and there's no heating in my apartment, but he'd probably understand why I've never, ever told anyone about being queer in real life, and will never act on it or say a word about it to my family while they're alive. 
---
When I talked about struggles earlier in my posts, I meant social or emotional ones. Things like, relationships to parents. Some people grew up loved and cared for, some people got told life would be better if they didn't exist. In my case, I grew up understanding that my parents gave me life and provided for me, and in exchange, it's my duty to show my appreciation by studying well and getting a good job. That way, I can fulfill my obligation of providing for my parents when they're old. 
---
What makes life difficult is physical needs like not knowing if you'll have enough money for food next week, but also emotional ones like wondering if it even matters to the world whether you're around or not, or questioning if you have any meaningful connection to anyone. I think that everyone struggles with those questions, and the way people try to answer them drives how they live. 
---
Anyway though, thank you for taking the time to discuss with me because I learned a lot. I was thinking on my way home that you don't actually hear about many artists or writers who started off truly poor and struggling--seems like whenever you hear about a struggling creative, they usually had a well-off family helping them in the background. I hate that creative fields are gated by needing to have that cushion in case you don't make it... even I only went for it because I had that cushion of being able to go back to my parents and do chinese takeout if I couldn't get any jobs in the field. For someone who didn't have that, it'd be far tougher and riskier. I wish it wasn't.
---
dont waste your time. he is posting it that way on purpose, because he wants to shit on the game... again and again.

I would wonder why NCsoft would deny guild wars 3 in the first place. If anything the side project of a guild wars 3 would‚Äôve been a positive thing and it would truly be worth to slowly stop developing gw2. However it was ‚Äúside‚Äù projects and had nothing to do with guild wars 2, maybe not even guild wars history at all. There has been rumors of a mobile game that was coming. However I didn‚Äôt see any pictures, or references etc to even prove it was mobile. I guess the only thing that proved mobile things were developed were arenanets job openings and mobile code was a requirement?
---
As far as this guild wars 3 rumor, if anything all arenanet has to do is renew the gw2 engine and make actual content besides story. Gw3 wouldn‚Äôt have changed anything since their business model is still atrocious in their philosophy of how the game should be. If gw3 was in the making I doubt ncsoft would say no since gw3 would‚Äôve been a omega cash grab. 
---
If anything the second side project was a complete different game on its own.

I didn't call you a puppet. I called you a muppet. Imagine being this upset over something that's been the trend FOR YEARS. Since season 3 launch really... and still playing/being invested in the game. Not only a muppet, you are the puppet. A slave. Do you have copperfed? You are the problem. Any inventory, bank, char slots? You. Are. The. Problem. Learn to look in the mirror. Check your ego.
---
... and that is fine. There is real life cost and someone has to pay it. It's everyone's decision to do so, or not.
---
Not exactly, it could have been produced out of free keys (story, map completion).
---
I miss my Derwisch :(
---
I noticed one of these... :( 
---
 So here take this... :D
---
Ive been around since GW1.  
---
The game needs new elite specializations.  Preferably two or three per class.  It's an artificial way of extending content but it's historically proven to work and satisfy players.
---
Well the next best fractal healer *by far* is [renegade](https://discretize.eu/builds/revenant/heal-renegade). So if you're looking to make a meta pick that's your answer. If swapping legends is as big a deal as you said it is then I'd still suggest firebrand (mantras are really fine, you don't charge them up besides at the start) and if that still doesn't work you might find some pug groups that will still take a druid but you'll have trouble in T4s and especially CMs

I think this is the best known texture mod support in gw2? Not sure how updated it is, but it was working at least up until the roller beetle came out. https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/4dgzip/release_modelmod_modify_art_in_games/

I'm just playing for fun bro. I never focused on crafting or collecting materials.

I did just that...

Coke caps are useless. Their only point would be getting the umbrella. They're a sheer bonus to the soda. When buying the soda you're after the drink, not the cap.
---
Statuettes are the soda. They are what you buy. More precisely, about a quarter of what you buy in BLC.
---
Mind giving back a quarter of your soda for the umbrella? That'd be 125 bottles.
---
There are people on my friendlist with less points and they are shown on the leaderboard :/
---
This. Bingo
---
Just realized flavour salads is referring to sylvari hahahaha
---
The problem with GW2 is anything they do is a giant balancing act for Anet. I think PvP is probably the best mode right now purely because it's innately re-playable, allows you to utilize the combat fully, and is easy to drop in whenever you want (mostly). It's also a mode that needs relatively little new content to thrive so it's probably not worth talking about in terms of making cuts.
---
LW content after completing the story is basically just a giant checklist and the maps are almost never interesting enough to justify how much development resources are spent there. I would easily drop them completely and find a way to deliver the story in smaller instances. Sadly I don't have a clue what percentage of the player-base engages this content and spends money because of it, but based on what I see ingame and on this sub I think the majority of players actually do enjoy this content so I'm screwed there.
---
In my ideal world Anet would basically cut everything that isn't sPvP, raids, and fractals. I always think WvW is going to be interesting, but in practice it's kind of a boring mode that has huge performance problems. It's also another mode that I don't think needs a massive dev team to thrive so it's probably fine even though I don't enjoy it much and I bet alliances and seasons could make it more fun.
---
tl;dr delete LW, maybe also WvW, but seasons and alliances could make WvW interesting.
---
Stupid idea that is probably not feasible but might amuse you.  Aura slots on weapons, kind of like infusions give the player an aura, but instead the aura applies only to the weapon to which it it is applied at the time.  So apply a flame aura to a regular staff and suddenly it's got flames on it, and flame trails when it moves.  Higher end (read: gem store most likely) ones could even to an extent do what legendaries do and adjust your projectiles/animations.  Like I said, probably a stupid and not very feasible idea, but figured you might get a kick out of it.
---
...seeing the words: 'a source tells me', ...
---
And like E, and the Shadow Stone and the Leyline Anomaly, the story about why Lyssa helped Balthazar is another forgotten storyline that is left unresolved.
---
I missed it. Any tldw? Clips?
---
GUIs and CLIs are show humans interact with applications. Api's are how applications interact with each other.
---
In this case, a site like GW2efficiency can now access the build and equipment templates we've created on our accounts.
---
Did the exact same thing around mid-heavensward.
---
Game just drew me in and being able to play all playstyles from one character....well...it's hard to argue. I never even kept up on all my classes in GW2, way too much work just to experience a new style.
---
I'm pretty sure plenty have a good idea of what a realistic roadmap would be. And you're right it's not something that would create hype.
---
Who cares about what anet says anymore. Just look at their results and releases. Those say enough.
---
Taco indicators for this would be 10/10
---
This is the best post I‚Äôve seen on reddit in a while !!
---
Ironic... I left for 3-4 years, just came back in the last month.
---
I can see how the population has dropped (the guilds I was in are all dead, most people haven't logged on in the last year).  But it's still a quality game with a ton to do, especially if you haven't been playing at all.
---
But in this way no one will do a specific old content but only the most rewarding.
---
We need a way to incentivize runs in old content, not a way to earn currencies: cycling daily/weekly, unique rewards, unique mechanics (like double rewards/drops/bonus chest in a specific map for a limited amount of time)
---
Isn't that line uttered during the final-final fight with Balthazar with Kralky watching? The fight pictured is the first time you meet Balthazar when Glast explodes.
---
Blaming ncsoft is pathetic. It was anet that consistently failed to even keep the game healthy. They've been removing support from features as soon as they release them for years. They've been failing to communicate for years. More than once have I seen updates that angered their fans more than it brought in new players. 
---
Ncsoft isn't responsible for one of their more expensive projects being a massive fucking failure. Ncsoft didnt have 400 employees jerking off while producing so little content their game couldn't even sustain the persistent dreams, aka delusions of hope and potential, of the playerbase.
---
The potential of the game, some of its features and combat will never weigh up to the massive black hole that is anets incompetence.
---
At this point, anets converting their own whiteknights surely but slowly. And oh boy is it entertaining.
---
Yeah, with HoT they at least tried to be somewhat consistent about their story they were telling. Sylvari were controllable. It made a difference.
---
With PoF, it's like "Oh yeah, some player chars might be sorta worshipping him? Hrm... true. Ah whatever, ship it!".
---
Don't forget there is a 50% chance they have malware on their site when you visit it.
---
That's hardcore man. We'll played ^^
---
This. When wvw was healthier it wasnt even played for rewards because they were dog shit. So bad it was almost offensive. Wvw, not eotm, mind you.
---
Rewards are nice for loot hungry skrit but if its not FUN it wont last. And it didnt :).
---
Fashion wars and the playerbase treating grinding shinies in a few overly rewarding maps as "good" did a lot of damage to the game tbh.
---
Gladly there is still league. Reward wise, I cant even spend my BE on anything but a few icons. The only way I get rewards is by being friendly in my games, as I've got no use for BE.
---
But the game gets balance updates, doesnt consistently reward you for griefing, doesnt promote playing as  badly possible while punishing those who actually try to get stuff done.
---
And competition keeps a certain type of carebears away. Thank god for that.
---
im pretty sure the latest spike to 35-40g was manually done by anet
---
they also increased 2000 gemm cards price from 20 to $30 over night

Don't use actual "AdBlock", use uBlock Origin. AdBlock is sold for commercial uses and will let through ads that pay them, it's complete crap.
---
Western mmo market is dead. Mmos are too expensive to make for a small market.
---
By losing a lot of diversity, especially losing a lot of hardcore players and competitive players over the years theres way less players to carry the weight of development.
---
Add to this that many remaining mmo players like to undermine their mmos. Carebears helped at undermining any competitive mmo. Casuals demanded an end to high end raids and content. And with these segments getting relatively larger, the issues only get worse. 
---
But even the casual segment has a huge amount of competition. And a lot of this competition from other genres is less expensive and less risky.
---
Even riot, investing in plenty of genres for new games, and knowing plenty of their fans are interested in an mmo, hasn't invested into developping one.
---
I hope mmos transition towards dress up simulators without combat. Combat is too hard anyways. Maybe an F button to interact might suffice? 
---
No need for combat or enemies at all should cut down the costs. /s
---
Please stop spamming these garbage ideas... it only promotes griefing other players and will directly lead to even more toxicity. 
---
Debuffs with other players nearby is honestly a degenerate idea. How do you not realise that in the time it takes you to write this.
---
Better now than after falling in love with the game further. Pvp is populated in part by bots which get up to high gold, low plat. That should say enough tbh.

I played ESO a little bit and it's cash shop is pretty horrendous too.

You don't put money in games? so I guess they company that develop games are still in the Soviet Union :D

Few days ago I decided to pick a new MMO so the choices for me were Neverwinter which I tried it and GW2, then I realized Neverwinter was a huge grind or pay where GW2 is a buy-to-play if you want to see the true content, the problem with free games and this will sound like an oxymoron is that "they are too expensive"

Apply Social Awkwardness in WvW
---
Yeah thats the moment when it definitely made me disgusted with the game. Triple charging was definitely not the path they should have gone down.
---
Dead game mode, if you want, when it‚Äôs ready for QA testing.
---
&gt; What's wrong with more people getting involved with WvW?
---
Because this game mode is actually on life support by older player and it would piss them off making it another borderland. Just look what was reaction to desert borderlands.
---
I had this recently with the las LS patch.  The file that refused to download was the final cinematic from the story instance.  I only know that because my game would perma freeze after finishing the instance.  I reached out to support and they had me try a few things but nothing worked.  4 days after the patch it finally downloaded on its own without issue.  I suspect Comcast (my ISP) or something on my network caused the issue
---
&gt;Add to this that many remaining mmo players like to undermine their mmos.
---
Hahahahahahahaha. Oh the irony.
---
If you own a gaming mouse, use the software it came with to lower the polling rate. See if that helps. GW2's older engine has a few issues with higher polling rates on modern gaming mouses ~~(mice? haha)~~ \- it's possible it's affecting/throttling your CPU just that tiny bit too much, which can cause the performance issues and input delays.
---
They wanted to diversify; I don't think it would have been GW3.
---
Maybe back in 2012.
---
Intentionally unresolved. Oh I guess that makes it alright then.
---
In my opinion, the main problem with zergs is that--for most of the players in them--they make your personal contribution feel meaningless compared to that of the group as a whole. Unless you're getting top dps by a large margin, providing a perfectly-timed MI to save your squad, or nailing the ideal spellbreaker bubble, it is very hard to notice the outcome of the battle changing due to something *you* did. Heck, I'd say it is hardest when you're playing in the zerg the way most commanders want you to.   
---
  
---
Yesterday, I had one of the most fun battle experiences I've had in a while, and it was with a ragtag group of ~10 attacking a t3 bay that had defenders increasing in number from 2 to about our number as the battle went on. Though the method was extremely unorthodox, getting in the outer involved us attacking from two very different sides--2 of ours trebbed the southeast wall from SWT and fought off the defenders there, while the rest of us went north to distract the defenders, take NWC, and set up rams at wurm gate. A few of our group got caught up defending the camp while resupplying, and next thing we know our northern group got split up with 4 of us on the rams and 4 defending NWC.  
---
The enemies killed the 4 at the camp, then charged for those of us at the rams. We got the gate down just as the first enemy's pounce landed on us, and it became a 4v4 at the north gate while the rest of the group (some of whom were respawning) moved to finish off the southeast walls. After the 4v4 ended, our two groups met in the middle of bay and went up onto the wall to make some catas for inner. What ensued was a fun little skirmish with us fighting off about 4-6 defenders at a time while the catas chipped at inner.  
---
Both sides kept losing players; the respawn caravan was fairly constant, but there was a palpable sense of your effect on the flow of battle. A reaper and holo have 2 of your allies down, so you jump in and interrupt/boonstrip with a full counter. You kill one and force the other to fall back, but then two warriors--back from respawning--jump in and put you on the defensive again. A dragon banner shows up and starts trashing your teammates, so you focus him and see the battle swing into your favor as he goes down. This isn't a 30v30 where each big blob turns and runs away the moment the other blob charges, this is a 10v10 where half of each time is occupied by manning siege or running back at any given moment, and the other half is fighting to protect or destroy those manning the siege.
---
Eventually, we got into inner and, after some intense fighting, a few pulled tactivators, and lots of enemy respawns, got wiped--but dang it was fun, primarily because it was clear that each player's actions (on both sides) made a difference. Breaking off from the commander to focus and down the DH nuking y'all--'cause hey, you know your stances can get you back safely--saves the rest of the group, and it works even if you miss out on a few boons.
---
The problem with zergs is that they greatly diminish that sense of personal contribution you get in a smallscale fight--if you break off from the pack, you lose the oodles of boons the group gives, any damage you do is instantly healed by 5 FBs, and you are easily steamrolled. You either follow the hivemind or die as a useless rallybot, amd that just isn't quite as fun.
---
Fairly sure it's more along the lines of " is sending ONLY sylvari a good idea?"
---
All this time I thought certain players just had really weird ping.  
---
Not worth the risk imo. I'd rather consistently get 17-18 runs in 30 minutes than to throw away a whole minute and change with this trick.
---
&gt; Anet killed the lore with PoF. Turning Balthazar evil...
---
WTF garbage are you trying to pander? It sounds like you don't have the first clue about "human lore".
---
Balthazar's first moment on Tyria was showing up carrying the severed head that he had just chopped off his own father. His next party trick was trying to lead the humans, who had just arrived on Tyria, in genocide against the native races of Tyria. Balthazar has been a petulant prick from the very beginning.
---
wait, arent those weapons skins like 50-100 gold each? this must be a joke right? nobody is going to spend that amount of statues on it...
---
Yeah I could have, but this literally my second time through the game (since the 3 day early release when it first came out) so it was kinda fun to see the moment I'm fill context
---
Except that revive orbs doesn't actually work in strike missions.
---
So I'm not going crazy. I stopped in front of a pillar and questioned "...wait.... was that there before??"
---
...you can still do everything with your 2012 exotic berserker gear, with exception of high level fractals, which are specifically designed to simulate gear progression. Same gear, same level.
---
You can even stat-swap ascended gear to reduce the work cutting-edge raids have to do. Stat-select gear got changed, too!
---
I genuinely see no carrot there. If anything, Anet *reduces* carrots.
---
Such an odd thing to see people complaining about carrot design.
---
I hate the current underwater fractals to the point I almost always skip it when its part of the daily, and I never ever do it when its part of rec.
---
For roaming, high-mobility versions of pvp builds tend to work well. If you're not used to player v player type action in GW2, I'd suggest using some of the builds on Metabattle to give yourself a few ideas.
---
Yes, it's a very common trope in fairytales and older fantasy.
---
yup i just queued for a match, and won, it ddnt reflect in my games played this season not did it show on my game history.
---
But will Guild Wars 3 follow Guild Wars 2?
---
Still would've loved to see my warband *somewhere*.
---
Ah ok, thanks! I always considered it still broken as my tool still doesn't work.  Reading your notes though explains why though due to the new inclusion of 'condition' which can be used to provide the correct daily information.
---
To add to this, we also got a few one on ones with Canach where we talk about our resisting the corruption throughout the story if you're Sylvari. Really helped evolve Canach's character imo.

There are shipment boxes you can buy for Volatile Magic in LW4 maps which give you mats you can sell for a profit. The Volatile Magic tools give you Volatile Magic (a LW4 Currency) when you gather materials using them.

Nah its worse than just bring a regular dps and use consumables in 5man content to cc.

They don't work in strikes

No wonder arenanet is going downhill
---
Good players can consistently get among the  top dps in 50 man squads. Especially on non stacked servers. 
---
Contributions dont matter if people have equal skill. That isnt reality. Reality is a small group of players hsve more impact than the majority of the zerg.
---
True. Even if you officially left service its not uncommon irl for former squad mates in the military to grab a beer.

1. Subbed MMOs are not the only ones that bother giving actual content.

2. A lot, unlike GW2.

Nope, but keep it up.

do u have 120 games played at minimum? just to be sure i know its sounds dumb.

Hello there, welcome to Spaghetti Code, where we will bug out for all your gaming needs.
---
I honestly don't see why people struggle with UW fractal... If you take a normal setup of firebrigade BS 2xDps with decent UW gear you almost faceroll it.
---
I do see a problem with people that go there with a lvl17 aquabreather and weapon. But that's not the fractal problem, it's the players.
---
Tbh they screwed up molten furnace more than they did aquatic.
---
Twitter making history here folks
---
The fractal is not the problem, underwater builds are the problem. 
---
Too many skills stop working underwater, and too many traits have to effects or reduced effects for underwater weapons.  
---
Whatever build you may come up for land that you like, chances are it won't work underwater.   
---
They have shown they can make skills still work underwater, like necromancer wells or ranger traps.  But some skills working underwater is not enough. All should work underwater.   
---
For example, take Ventari. You obviously can't ground target underwater, but it should be possible to target enemies and allies to make the tabled 'swim' to them and stick to them until they die, then make the tablet return to the Revenant and float next to them, like a necromancer minion would. 
---
And they have made certain weapon traits have effects for underwater weapons too, but not all of them do, and not for all professions.     
---
Take necromancer. You can bring  Lingering Curse  to focus on condition damage with a scepter, but it will do nothing for spear and trident.   
---
I doubt they can change every weapon to work underwater, but at least every weapon trait could have an extra effect that makes an underwater weapon work more like the trait's weapon. Something like this:
---
* Spiteful Talisman (Axe+Focus) : Underwater weapons now deal vulnerability with every autoattack. 
---
* Quickening Thirst (Daggers) : Wicked Spiral steals life with each hit, more damage when the enemy is bleeding, more self-healing when you are bleeding. Dark Spear now also causes Immobilize but self-inflicts 2 stacks of bleeding. 
---
* Lingering Curse (Scepter): Gain condition damage with a trident, and Feast now corrupts boons when it hits. 
---
* Soul Marks (Staff): Makes Foul Feast unblockable, gain more life force with Crimson Tide.
---
* Banshee's Wail (Warhorn): Deadly Feast now lasts 8 seconds and both Deadly Feast and Deadly Catch have reduced recharge. 
---
* Fell Beacon (Torch): Replace Frozen Abyss with Boiling Abyss, dealing burning instead chilled with every pulse. 
---
That or do the same as with the necromancer greatsword trait, and change weapon traits into generalist traits that will work well with the weapon, but won't require it.
---
had no idea MO left entirely...
---
I actually snorted. The irony hit me like a fist.
---
Fits with the rest, though. Several huge mainstream MMOs, a ton of niche MMOs - ded gerne!
---

"They didn't ruin his character because they retconned his character very recently to be completely different so it makes sense" - wtf is this arguement?
---
Previously he did what he did to help humanity and now he suddenly doesn't care if he himself wipes them out, like how can you say that's not "turning evil"? All his developement happened off-screen and did a complete 180, then we 1v1 a fucking god in an easymode story instance (oh sry 2v1 we have a baby lizard flying around too). They didn't do justice to him at all.
---
They should've made PoF be about Menzies and it would've made more sense in every way.
---
Don't post MOP "articles", they just re-post shit from other sites and reddit.
---
As a comparison, [here's an actual MMO article.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dm2bby/how_guild_wars_2s_mounts_were_made/)
---
I doubt this is true, but if it was, NCSoft probably knows from Lineage that once people are set in an MMO, it'll be rather hard to get them to move to a sequel for as long as they have things to do and friends there.
---
No I don't.
---
I rarely play human when given other options, I am looking forward to this moment as well.
---
hey... Do you also want Flux Bomb and Last Laugh?
---
no, my point is that you suck at underwater combat
---
Don't waste precious food like I did!

Having the breather and rune in it is a good bonus, but nothing crucial. Only recently I have noticed that I don't have a breather on my DH and tbh not even rushing to get one yet, cause dmg is still great.

I was wondering why no one was posting a thread about this issue here. Been having this problem for 8 hours now. It seems it's instance related and some maps work, while others don't?

but what for our non turkish players ?

"Enhancements have been temporarily disabled while we try to resolve the issue."
---
Nobody plays it? I've been doing it daily since it begun and had no problem whatsoever getting groups in LFG. They're also somewhat organized groups.
---
Zerging is not the issue, it's a symptom of the issue. There's no solution that can solve the "problem" of Zerging's impact on WvW if you don't address the actual issue: WvW doesn't matter. People Zerg because it's the most efficient way to get rewards, it is assuredly *NOT* the most effective strategy to *win* a WvW matchup, but there is no reason to trouble yourself with identifying and employing those strategies.

It's kinda annoying for me to use as a novelty, so I prefer it like that

Well they managed rev back in hot, I'm not saying they should release new classes now since the game is in its decline. But for me personal it was something I missed, being able to dive down into a new class and learn it. :-)

I've read the FAQs, the GW2 website, googled, etc etc and I'm still confused on this. I want to gift the game to a few friends. Do I have to buy the Core game, and if so, where? Or would I buy the Standard pack (29.99 - included the two expansions)?
---
Holy fuck! Skynet is alive!
---
And it hosts racists!
---
That's how they get people to go into wvw.
---
GW2 may never have been the return on the money they were hoping for. Remember it isn't about being profitable when it comes to investments, it is about degrees of return or projected return.

A publisher that nolonger has faith in a company is absolutely capable and likely to say "nope"

Yea, personally I only ever take them to the long boss fights at the end of a season... They're so buggy and I don't fancy restarting everytime
---
doesn't work anymore.
---
but you can queue for pvp..wonder if that would force a reload of the snowman raid insance when your match was over.
---
you can't gg if you're already dead
---
They really need to allow leaving of these instances when dead.
---
I ttttried public freezie, if you dont leave intime inbetween revive and someone restarting the fight your stuck for another 10+ mins it takes the pubkic team to lose, yet again.
---
I keep forgetting that.
---
Usually the checkpoint would kick in with everyone dead. This is definitely an unforeseen bug from converting the 10-person dungeon into a strike.
---
Regardless of truth or not...I would be highly interested in a GW3. I think it would bring a lot of people back to the game.
---
Heal FB is one of the classes that is still really good underwater. Everything functions the same as on land: all your utility skills work, your symbols still pulse healing, your tomes work, and you even have a healing autoattack.
---
I could understand if you were upset about a class that actually is harmed by being underwater like Renegade whose Kalla legend is completely unavailability underwater. But as a HB your class loses nothing as functions the exact same as on land.
---
This could just be a statement that Guild Wars 2 followed Guild Wars.
---
I managed to get into LFG and find working DR instance. Unfortunately after I left the toypocalypse instance I got kicked back into the broken map. Still worth a shot.
---
I think it may be even less than that.
---
It's a dance style called "Shuffling" and the Human dance is taken from this video: [https://youtu.be/KQ6zr6kCPj8?t=219](https://youtu.be/KQ6zr6kCPj8?t=219)
---
If you're playing heal fb idk how this fractal causes problems. Sure might will suck since you lose staff but your utility skills still give more than enough healing.
---
Character says it, and it's a voiced line. However, you have to have chosen Balthazar as your god at character creation
---
See ya next patch
---
Then this is even a better match for your play style, not really possible to fall behind equipment wise in this game.  Long breaks do not equal "I have to catch back up" here.
---
Things I'd suggest, kind of pulling from other comments here as well as my own suggestions: play a squishy class (if playing necro, dont use any minions) so that you focus on dodging and positioning more. Use a twohanded weapon, ideally greatsword, staff daredevil is fantastic for this as well. Turn screenshake back on, set it to max. Subwoofers really add weight to the sound as well (gw2 sound is fantastic, actually). Use action cam. Adjust your camera position to your personal preferences. Adjust fov (warning, can and will decrease your framerate if you increase it too much). Play asura (seems counterintuitive but it makes a huge difference), or play charr or norn (less effective but can have the same effect).

The expectation is to receive a gift, but that‚Äôs not the point of signing up. I‚Äôm signing up to make someone‚Äôs else day a little bit better by giving them gifts. I could care less if I get anything in return.

By the way, I have anyways received a gift front my Secret Santa, not everyone is a Scrooge like you.

well,if you speedrunning with qb,war is good for prestacking banners and than you just skip every phase on every boss in fractals. Many ppl still dont undertand why they even have qb in pt and they just playing like with hfb,so in the end,you are not faster and if you have some bad apples,you can be even slower than with hfb.
---
Its also good to have another dedicated CCmancer. (last 4 days no1 ccd single time,even after i pointed out,that we gona need extra CC) but as always,you dont rly need anything,if you dont have tryhard hats on. We had today thief as DPS and no1 cared... so ye,ppl are still mostly playing hfb anyway. maybe one day,you will be able to start doing 500kp+ runs,but as it is now,you are glad that you waitning just 20 mins for 4 random ppl.
---
If you do not want to play I would gladly take care of your characters so it wouldn't tempt you to get back to the game.
---
Do what I do, and listen to map chat and then solo flip towers.  Challenging and fun!
---
Yes, I know it‚Äôs the human dance, and where it‚Äôs from. Which is why I shared it to the GW2 subreddit.
---
Well for a company that appears to have abandoned plans to develop and release paid expansions and is adversely against subscription fees to the point that the game was built from the ground up to never need them, the gemstore is all they have. It's an unfortunate side effect of the buy-to-play model that Anet has gone with and one which we unfortunately must accept for the time being.
---
see u in NEW WORLD
---
I didn't see all of it, but he praised the author for his bluntness, saying that maybe he even went too far with his criticism in a few points. 
---
There should be a VOD of the stream on Twitch.
---
i want to burn my eyes after reading this cringe shit
---
I'm so sick of them using players as guinea pigs. It's pushing me further and further away from the game, I feel this vague sense of mental exhaustion everytime I think about the ever-expanding gemstore... I, like many others, want this game to be healthy, but all I see is, well, things I do NOT see: expansion-worthy content, for one. Only expansion-worthy thing here is the goddamn pricing on gemstore items.
---
as stated before. i disaggree with you statement about buying with gold as an excuse to basicly make nothing p2w. 
---
&gt; Also, while at it...tell me what you had to do to acquire that real money you're spending on the game.
---
bypassing required playtime to accomplish something with the excuse that you spent time somewhere else to get it is just a wrong statement on its own. on this bases i could simply say: "hey i was 6 years busdriver now, give me my 6 years study master degree if i pay you the neccessary stuy loans".
---
&gt; Would it make any difference if it was implemented via a vendor from whom you could buy it for 160g? No...it wouldn't. The gemstore can basically be classified as a npc vendor with rotating items.
---
no it can not. the whole intend behind the gem shop is to buy items with real money, therefor not using gold but gems instead. yes it is interchangable, but it is still its own form of currency, with its own mainsource/intended source.
---
because of this i also disaggre with your statement about classifying p2w. specificly your second point about alternative means. making an ingame option to get a currency that is mainly aquired by real world money is not a safe way to label everything in the gemshop as not p2w.
---
I know a lot of people didn't like the storyline of PoF, but I loved this subplot.
---
There's the massive party in Amnoon where everyone is so relieved the rogue god is killed. And then, bit by bit, the realization sets in. You killed a god--one of the human gods who shepherded humanity and gave them the bulwark of strength to survive against the encroachment of other races and the Elder Dragons.
---
And bit by bit they begin to turn against you. It is one thing to cast judgement upon the actions of Balthazar, but you raised your hand and brought the sentence down upon him. There was no council of humanity, no collective determination from all peoples that death should be the final punishment.
---
Some lone adventurer, the Commander of the pact, risen from nothing and wandering the wilds. Seeking riches and glory, forever moving from one battle to the next. Slayer of Dragons. Hero of Tyria. Mist Warrior. Shining Blade. Champion of Glint.
---
Godslayer.
---
There is no oversight for their actions; they simply identify a threat and take their own personal initiative to bring them down. Even the backing of the Pact has limits; no one soldier should be in charge of the fate of the world.
---
And if not even  Gods and Elder Dragons can stand before the Commander...
---
... what is the bigger threat to Tyria?
---
I think what he saying is-
---
Yeah no. This is beyond me.
---
I only have 3 accounts, and am only on 2 at any one time.  No issues on my end.  Also I am NA.
---
No I dont mean the way that is fun for me.Players play as they enjoy, that makes sense.
---
You are proud to not take anyone else into account and only play how you feel like. Fine by me but toxicity between players with different styles will result. Extra funny if they use that toxicity as an excuse to play extra selfish as if they arent part of the problem.
---
Game design should focus on aligning these players rather than leading them to blatant toxicity. 
---
Forcing a debuff when too many allies are nearby is the opposite. Any guild you "blobsurf" nearby where you put them over the cap would hate your guts. Youd be griefing them.
---
But as you already showcased, you dont care about the groups you stalk. Youd still do it anyways and be proud. 
---
So the debuff wouldn't really promote smaller groups. It would promote groups to bully their excess pugs, and trash pugs would grief even harder than before.
---
Hence the idea of forcing a debuff to get rid of groups is degenerate. It doesnt promote desired gameplay (in this thread anti group which is honestly not something jm even interested in) at all.
---
Obviously groups having the ability to exclude griefers such as yourself would promote more groups and comms to play the game. Luckily for you that wont happen. Less luckily for you that means there will be less and less opportunities to "blobsurf" aka leech.
---
do need buffs that improve your performance over other player to support the game? no! you can support it with buying skins/account upgrades.
---
anet pls fix
---
EotM is the best map. That map was packed very day back then. When you go to eternal battle grounds, it was empty because everyone was in eotm. It is a fun map with diff mechanics (loved pushing or fearing peeps on ledges lol). The bases had a hierarchy (blue was the most dangerous which was given to the 3rd place team and green was least dangerous and given to the 1st place team). This was to help offset balance issues.
---
That all ended when anet gave rewards to battle grounds only.
---
Barriers + minor heal from other sources r ok, cos boss have really low dmg, so, i meant full viper condi scourge.

Nah, it's any human, just have to have chosen Balthazar at character creation

A bug

Thank god after all those fixes they made to AT they finally investigate
---
&gt; But in a fit of anger, Balthazar slew Kaolai. Afterward, in a rare gesture of sportsmanship, the god ordered Kaolai inducted into Tahnnakai Temple.
---
Still, it was not an act of evil, just lost his temper for a moment and in the end gave him one of the greatest honors in Cantha as compensation. Quite different from PoF Balthazar.
---
It was a pain before, and it is a pain after. I personally don't feel the fight is much longer or more painful than it was before. Then again I don't join speedrun-focused LFG PUGs and I'm not in a fractal guild, so YMMV. But for the average player I'd say not much has changed
---
Thanks.  I guess I better figure out how to get it
---
No wonder every original OG from Anet is leaving. They finally understood that the game lost its soul. Which this post reminds me of that the game had. Not the crap we have now.

I know, thought he might consider it for consistency, since he said he wants to make it easier to follow for viewers who aren't all that used to watch the game mode.

No mention of raids or fractals?
---
Raids and fractals are hard dead.
---
The warclaw changes look good I guess, but as somebody who mostly played the game for WvW I'm disappointing that it's all that's coming. Looks like they plan to have 2 story episodes out in the first 3 months which is at least encouraging on the casual PvE side, not that it's something I frequently do.
---
Oh hey, Swiss Cheese is finally in the game! Yay!

Roadmap :)

&gt;‚ÄúScry into the past and witness what life is like as a member of Ryland‚Äôs elite Steel Warband. 
---
Good. Very good.
---
I mean this more as feedback more than criticism: ArenaNet wants to develop a single-player story. Because of that, the existence of Pact Commander holds them back from telling the kinds of story experiences the developers really want to tell, since not only do they have to keep in mind the Commander's origins/race, but also player internal roleplay headcannon (lol...).  By letting us see directly as Ryland, they don't have to worry themselves from developing more dramatic moments of story.
---
"Expansion like content"
---
Well...at least we got a roadmap
---
Oh, I wasn't trying to make a point against you, just wanted to give you the story the person was referring to.
---
I agree with you, I too dislike Balthazar's portrayal as a villain in Guild Wars 2.
---
Wow, that was the only thing you took out of the thing... lol...
---
As a Gw2 player since day 1 this a great christmas present ... Ty Anet &lt;3
---
While sirens reef is nuts even on T1, I'll never understand the hate for Twilight Oasis, it's the best fractal ever created
---
No raids wtf
---
Raids never
---
Look for a raid training guild then! Raids are the most fun PvE content once you get into it. Especially if you find a nice static. Also there's strike missions now.
---
Or learn the basics of PvP, it'll be fun and well worth it (imo). Although it takes some time before you finally stop pressing buttons at random instead of actually playing the game mode... Just don't stress yourself too much about your rating and look for a build you enjoy. GW2's combat system excels in PvP ;)
---
That's a new one.
---
I am looking forward to ride those charr panzers :)
---
Oh yeah man! Look at those Elite Specs... 
---
Oh, wait. 
---
I fooking told people. Never getting them outside a paid Xpac.
---
Well, still no mention of Raids or Fractals.  Time to back it in endgame PvE'ers, your content of choice is now more dead than PvP or WvW.  It's to the Dungeon room with you.  FeelsBadMan
---
Actually they directly alluded to the new Dragon Bash event being a strike mission.
---
&gt;in 2020, we‚Äôre adding a new PvE activity for Lunar New Year, the Celestial Challenge. Similar to Dragon Bash‚Äôs Dragon Arena,
---
Dragon Arena was a strike mission.
---
Its not dead, its on the table, shoved in the basement where the key has been lost. Or, the developer for raids and fractals is busy coding, mopping the floor and getting coffee for the entire office.

ROADMAP
---
This game is beyond dead lmao
---
Boneskinner tho...
---
Q1 means January, February, March, April. If there is one to come it would be Mai at the earliest, it would mean 11 months for a new raid and 15 months for a fractal.
---
New World sounds exciting. Guild Wars 2 is definitely on the decline. 2020 could be the year that it finally dies. Maybe MO saw the writing on the wall because he signed up to alphas and beats of rival MMOs and when he tried some of the most modern ones he realised...he was in trouble.
---
I can't believe people are following MO's new studio. Manaworks is a joke.
---
I guess I'm not coming back to the game anytime soon.
---
Considering all this roadmap did was confirm the community's worst fears about the game, I guess so.
---
Dungeon graveyard has been getting bigger now, with Fractal and Raids being dead too.At least we know what we will expect from now on.
---
the only thing it maps out is my decision to not log into this game ever again
---
It looks like it's not really a road map, more of a teaser what's incoming.
---
Episode 2 might mean everything. Including strike missions, legendaries, new professions, new game, new overlords, whatever. Just don't expect raids, it's too early for a new one and you all know it, they won't change this thing for sure. 
---
Don't read into things too much Mr. Reddit
---
Love it. Please dole out my medication!
---
bro give me ur account and ull give more joy to some1 else. :D
---
Can you give me some examples?
---
I was actually really excited to see this when I first read the article, since I thought these features were all to come in January alone. Seeing that this is gonna be everything the game has to offer in all of Q1 makes me very worried about the game's direction.
---
Count out the April, quater is 3 months
---
white knighting anet and denying criticism is cancer my man
---
&gt;Q1 means January, February, March, April.
---
That's some special definition of quarter.
---
many exciting additions to the game I see /s
---
New underwater mount? 
---
Would love a fast way to get around Tyria underwater. Especially with the recent underwater changes I could see an underwater focused episode for this saga :) 
---
What do you guys think?
---
Ice
---
Ah yeah, minus April. What will April have? SAB.
---
pathetic.
---
You really expect a official statement from Anet, I just gagged. 
---
You know it's not a road map? Especially not a detailed one? It's just a small teaser saying nothing really, we all knew that these things are coming in this quarter, we just weren't sure when is the Swiss tournament coming. 
---
Raids can happen in the season, just like Key is tied to s4e6
---
It's not like this article is a detailed post about "what's happening when and no other stuff allowed" you guys just read too much into it
---
Is there any special dialogue for picking Human race and Kormir deity and meeting her later on?
---
&gt;  I'll never understand the hate for Twilight Oasis, it's the best fractal ever created
---
While I pride myself a fan of Twilight Oasis, I can understand why people don't like it.
---
1. Final boss was too hard during first impressions. It had (or still has) a shockwave attack that could oneshot you. But the game doesn't educate you that you can use special action key to dodge it. As a result, players would exhaust endurance trying to evade boss' particle effects, only for her to use that special skill while people had zero endurance, and they'd die.  What's worse, the boss had five difficult phases, with the last phase having really tough adds you had to clear.
---
Now, all the above would be fine and dandy if it were a CM. But they just nerfed Amala, ruining the sense of accomplishment. And they didn't add a CM.
---
2. The Fractal doesn't really have a "middle" section with a sub-boss or gimmick. You're just making a b-line to the boss after plowing through mobs. It's mechanically not very stimulating. Take Ascalon Fractal's second half, but make it the whole fractal sums it up.
---
3. I mentioned it above, but there's no CM. People want diffcult but rewarding endgame content. 
---
4. The map design is a bit too confusing. It's not always obvious where to go, too easy to get lost during the second half, as you try to catch up with your team, and they're doing all sorts of cool tricks you don't know about.
---
In short:
---
- The level wasn't very good for a dungeon map. 
---
- The final boss released too hard, hurting the feefees of casuals and making the never do it again. But then they nerfed it, and not only were the casual feefees still too hurt to do it again, but now the hardcore players who wanted a CM were unhappy too.
---
Visions of the past sounds like the GW2 equivalent of bonus missions. That's cool, I guess.
---
Still no mention of new fractals or raids, big F.
---
It's probably Drakkar
---
No one knows. Check out official retailers, for example DLgamer has slightly lower price semi-regularly.
---
Anyway, HoT is nowadays frre when you buy PoF so that's already almost as good deal as the 50% off both expansions deal that used to pop up occasionally before the current system
---
"from now on?" you are waaaaaaaaaaaay to late :D
---
I have an occasional meetup night with 10-15 old dudes. Some guys moved away and I‚Äôm looking for a mmorpg to keep our meetup going.
---
None of us have ever played a mmorpg but we all have good internet and know how to use a laptop. 
---
We would be ultra casual, maybe meeting up a few times a year for 2-3 hours. 
---
What are the fastest/easiest ways to get to a point where we can experience the gameplay together? 
---
Can anyone describe the steps (after download, install, and account creation) to get through any intro or cut scenes and get 10 brand new characters to a point where we can all do some light PvE gameplay or just walk around and explore together?
---
Anet said till be reminisent of Triple Trouble and alike
---
&gt; steamed hams
---
Aurora borealis jokes intensifies.
---
Out of luck.
---
&gt; Definitions are not opinions, they're definitions. P2W is defined by advantage via real money.
---
...
---
&gt; Since there's so much confusion with certain types of people, let me try clarify what p2w actually is...and maybe you will realize that nothing in GW2 is actually p2w.
---
For something to be classified as p2w, it needs to meet ALL of the following criteria, if it does not, then it is not p2w:
---
    You have to pay using real world currency for an item/service
---
    The item/service is not available for purchase through alternative means without the use of real world currency
---
    The item/service provides a gameplay/progress benefit over other players who did not purchase said item/service (this includes a service to by-pass rng involved in acquiring an item)
---
...and guess what...NOTHING in gw2 is p2w, because there's not a single item/service that you cannot acquire through other means.
---
That is the reality. It does not matter if you want to accept it or not.
---
They could've just kept it short with "More of the same"
---
What you're not hyped to play as some rando with Ryland?! Visions of the Past could have been used on far more interesting characters... another swing and a miss.
---
&gt; You really expect a official statement from Anet, I just gagged.
---
no? Why would they ever confirm to stop developing something? 
---
&gt; You know it's not a road map?
---

---
&gt; "what's happening when and no other stuff allowed"
---
Here is what we will do the next 3 months. *2 months later* here, have a new raid. We could have told you earlier but no lol.
---
What reason would they have to do this?
---
thats exactly what you are doing here, you are acusing someone has false infomation without giving any prove 
---

---
The way I see it this is going to be something along the lines of fractals. I would honestly rather see it as a fractal because we DESPERATELY need more content, but it might end up being too long. People already complain about certain fractals being too long. That being said, this had better be repeatable for rewards, and the rewards had better be decent, otherwise people are going to do it once and never come back to it. It would be incredibly stupid to do all this work on a new game mode only to kill it by not making it rewarding.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dye
---
Wing 8 should drop on march 17th (280 days after w7) which is in Q1. IF we are getting w8 its past april... The "NOW" is presented for 3 months ahead.
---
A few months ago devs wanted feedback on CMs. So I think they're at least looking at the game mode.
---
I believe you could craft them? WvW chests of the mist also offer unidentified random dyes.
---
I would usually just grab it from the trading post though.
---
Every dye in the game is tradable and can be found on the trading post. Most originate from unidentified dyes (see the wiki for ways to acquire these), but Exclusive category dyes come from the gem store/black lion chests.
---
How do I prove something doesn't exist?
---
Show you a blank page?
---
The onus of proof is on the person making the claim.  The GW3 claim is old and has been dismissed because Kotaku had no proof, no sources and zero evidence at all.
---
Painfully true
---
‚ÄúFuck you and your WvW.‚Äù - ArenaNet, probably. 
---
We never wanted the Warclaw, still don‚Äôt. WvW has been such a horrible experience since.
---
Join the dark side anet, they've got cookies.
---
Yo It's Steve
---
This is blatant fake news, it's not even funny.
---
&gt;I mean, they release a raid roughly once half a year which has dropped a bit to once 8-9 months with the newer ones.
---
- wing 3 to 4: 8 months
---
- wing 4 to 5: 9.5 months
---
- wing 5 to 6: 9.5 months
---
- wing 6 to 7: 9 months
---
The only time they were less than 8 months were the first 3 wings, which were significantly less than half a year apart
---
&gt;I don't understand this whining, last one was 5 months ago and I would be really surprised if they released a new one now.
---
First of all: *Key of Ahdashim* was released june 11th. That's 6 months, not 5. July, August, September, October, November, December. Quarter 1 usually goes from January to March. If we don't get a new raid wing during the first quarter (and from this article, it doesn't look like it), then the next raid wing will release **at least** 9+ months after the last. That's in line with what we had previously, sure, but considering the "refocus" on Guildwars 2 and the new strike missions being sold as an entrance to raiding, many people were hoping for less time between releases. 
---
The "whining" is because instead of focusing more on raids and decreasing the time between releases (to maybe 6 months) or giving us another fractal challenge mode, we get another PvE instanced mode catered towards casuals (strike missions). If "elitists" would get even a tenth of the attention and content the casual players get, you wouldn't hear anyone "whining", or at least the ones that do would be at the bottom of every comment section.
---
This is so.................. ugh.....
---
Yikes, what kind of abomination of a build is this....
---
Elite specs.
---
Orphan run, the new karma dailies, then grind either the JP or the bells.
---
I thought the previous tournament was the last one? Is he doing another?
---
Anet seems to focus lately on making as much content replayable, if they make this dungeon like, and release after every episode, thatd be sweet
---
Under water content?
---
Check his username, he's just been daydrinking too much.
---
One you apparently havent tried yet :p
---
It's hard to roadmap content that doesn't exist.
---
Even cooler
---
Definitely check the trading post for dyes
---
You can also right click on a dye in that customization menu to search for it directly on the TP. There's plenty of colors available for chump change, but there's also some that cost a whole lot of gold.
---
It' somewhat disappoint that balancing of a mount is a part of the entire thing.
---
Remember when they said 'you'll hear more about it in the coming months' back at the LiViNg SaGa announcement event? We all knew they wouldn't talk about it in the coming months. They didn't. At least they live up to expectations tho üôÉ
---
Pretty sure they said Strike Missions are lws episode content, so Episode 2 = strike missions
---
It‚Äôs odd seeing people with this kind of luck considering I always get what I want and more out of just a handful of keys. I got a 25 set and got an uncommon or rare almost ever other chest just a few days ago
---
Never understood why Anet cant split long fractals like sirens reef, deepstone, twilight oasis into 2 fractals like aetherblace and mai trin.
---
Breaking warrior benchmarks during a low man.
---
I thought visions of the past was gonna be season 1 re-imagined. Feels duped man.
---
Yeah i try to not cripple everyone around me.
---
all the reworks are shit, it's not just underwater(and so are the "new" fractals)
---
the same bullshit over and over: boss goes invuln every 25% and you kill some trash mob that's far away then walk back, boss ports so you chase around, random roleplay mechanic like the swallowed puzzle or carrying some "treasure" around etc.
---
basically a truckload of pointless movement with invuln phases to make rotations awakward and artificially prolong the encounter
---
however, is it hard? lol no, just did it a few mins ago by mostly beign in melee range with autoattack enabled..it's a joke difficulty-wise but yea it's kinda annoying i'll give you that
---
might? that's mostly rev's job..oh wait you healbrand that's unlucky! maybe ask the rev to press f2? it's not like they got other stuff to do besides spamming boons because unlike guard their underwater weapons ARE actually trash(no kalla hurts a lot too)
---
 anet really dumbed the game down to astronomic proportions and people still complain when you press like 2-3 buttons and have all boons covered and fractal fights/phases last a few seconds anyway
---
Warclaw balance is the only thing on the roadmap for WvW?? Warclaw balance!? For the love of god, do anything else. There's a million things they could work on aside from this.
---
Yes it's harder in comparison but 1 heal scourge can still carry an awful group through it
---
I declare this character I know nothing about UNINTERESTING! ANET BAD!
---
press O, search for dye
---
I would love we get new a revival for GW1.
---
That's true but as i said I don't play with any expansions yet which correct if I'm wrong locks all dyes on the trading Post
---
Yeah he is uninteresting. Young Charr with Daddy Issues... so engaging...
---
Forgot to add 32 black lion claim ticket weapon. 2 $20 premium mount skins. 2 outfits,12 various skins and of course the world famous RNG mount skin loot box. All yours in the gem store. Very exciting.
---
What's the right attitude? Should he sit on his knee and suck on anet's dick for nothing of substance 'road map'.
---
Everything they showed us we already knew exception being Vision of the Past.
---
I don't like the sound of the "Visions of the Past" thing. It sounds a lot like the Caithe missions from LWS2 and I found those nothing but obnoxious. Forcing players into a (potentially) different class with a build they didn't set up, to play a character they really have no control over... For what? So the player base sympathizes with them when the commander decides to magically forgive them later? Because they ran out of ways to include our characters in things and now need character they define completely to have story?
---
There are other ways to introduce lore to people who would like more of it. I hope they can make the actual missions fun and interesting, but the idea of them isn't.

It's not going to be cheaper than that.
---

---
Thought the same.
---
Saw the picture and was like "wait, have they finally found a way to bring season 1 back?"... well, no.
---
I mean they can do that to fractals and most raids, too
---
Swiss will not do that match for the ranked scene. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs a long overdue change for ATs, but how many new people will play ranked because of it. 
---
The mini seasons they are planning would do much more for that imo.
---
What exactly are you using ICM for?
---
&gt;but it's better than total silence.
---
No actually, since all they showed is stuff we already knew and the Visions Of The Past crap seems to just be the setup for Strikes.
---
Time to quit, its been real guys! bye!
---
Give away all your items and gold...if not, then your words mean nothing.
---
&gt;just don't expect raids, it's too early for a new one and you all know it  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; Episode 2 might mean everything. Including strike missions, legendaries, new professions, new game, new overlords 
---
Who's the one expecting too much?
---
action camera toggle, with some UI removal during combat.
---
RIP endgame PvE content I guess. What's next? Maintenance mode ice brood saga?
---
Yes I do ;) I have around 150 I guess üëåüèº
---
.....y...es?   Nvm.
---
Thank you! How long is the intro to play through? If it‚Äôs just a couple of minutes that should be fine.
---
idk why others hate it but here's my reason list: unavoidable damage which is bullshit, lots of cc and condi spam that again can't be realistically avoided entirely, the usual timegated roleplay walk to kill a trash mob in 1s
---
Sometimes silence is deadlier than words.
---
Some mention of especs, raids, fractals, guild updates, and alliance would have gone a long way.
---
Would be interesting if you just don‚Äôt get points when u win or if you don‚Äôt loose some aswell :O
---
???
---
You can train to be a chef and there will be recipes available to you to make dyes depending on your crafting level.
---
&gt; Episode 2 might mean everything.
---
Narrator: It didn't.
---
totally
---
Yes that‚Äôs so weird! Cause when I did my last match it showed my name round about place 200 and now it‚Äôs grey and not in top 250 even though ppl with less points are in it now üòÇ
---
C'mon, how is anyone who didn't play Guild Wars 1 supposed to know this? Don't be so condescending.
---
Loving these has-beens who haven‚Äôt logged into the game for 6 months bringing negativity to a basic update post.
---
Funny, although I'm heavily disappointed at the lack of raids and actual wvw changes (alliances when?), your comment hit me the most. I miss the days where I would happily buy gems because I felt Anet more than deserved it. Now I just feel reproach, because it seems like the best/shiniest/coolest rewards are in the gem store
---
You're being idealistic
---
We are talking about arena net who is known as "we don't really know how to communicate so we just don't"
---
Weren't Aether/Mai Train originally seperate dungeons for LWS1? That might explain why they were able to split them for fractals. Same with Moltan Furnace/Boss.
---
Then just delete the game and move on with your life.
---
Imagine thinking anyone still cares about some random Sylvari in a small portion of the Sylvari personal story. That guy fell off the table during HoT. They'll probably save him for GW3 if they really have to.
---
You said you are a f2p player so the only way to get more dyes is from unidentified dyes. In the open world they are few a far between unless you do certson types of content. But in PvP you can get them easily through reward tracks.
---
Looks even more disappointing in image form. It just makes me sad at this point.
---
fractals, but its the PVE experience
---
This kind of things makes this game so great. Choosing your character creation will affect dialogues of 2 expansions later
---
"New overlords" damn you really need a /s to understand that it's a sarcasm?
---
pay for build templates
---
pay for capes
---
pay for [insert next expansion like content here]
---
&gt; Armed with the finest charr technology, the group will head into deadly snowstorms, dwarven ruins, and even explore the Darkrime Delves.  
---
This sounds like a Dungeon.
---
I buy all of mine and covet the ones I can never afford because it is hard af to make gold on the gams.
---
Say what you will, but I felt that those Caithe missions had the strongest storytelling of Season 2.
---
Aren't all of those features native to the client now?
---
Yes! When you go into Kormir's library you remark that you'd been blessed by her but never actually thought you'd see her
---
Its ya boi
---
So as someone that loves Fractals and Dungeons, who hasn‚Äôt played in a while, but spent a good chunk of money in this game, there really is nothing to come back for, is there?
---
When I saw roadmap picture:
---
&gt;**WvW**
---
OMG OMG alliances finally happening!
---
&gt;Warclaw Balance
---
Oh well
---
I care more about release trends than I do what they‚Äôre ‚Äúgoing for‚Äù at this point. They were going for 5-6 raid wings a year at one point.
---
No both of those were one dungeon.
---
News just in more of the same
---
VotP sounds like it'll be a more different fractals IMO
---
i swear you people are never happy, you ask for a roadmap then you get it and it's somehow not good enough
---
just kidding, dead game in a dead genre, sinking ship etc.
---
Actually you don't have to give ANet a dime, you can just *Gold -&gt; Gem* anything you'd like!
---
PM'd. We're on Anvil Rock, so if you join you'll have to transfer there.
---
Ah, I am in the wrong then. I swore I saw dates posted of 12/20/2019 all over gamestops pages, but of course they aren't there now.  
---
Back to waiting I suppose!
---
I have grown to like the warclaw. I‚Äôll be sad that it‚Äôs going to be nerfed into uselessness
---
Install ff14 for more content
---
I mean, realtalk, neither do I, but that sweet sweet code is in there.
---
Warclaw is fine SMH
---
From late 2016 to late 2018 it was stable, but after 2018 gems have only been going up. Might not be a linear growth, but it's higher than the growth of gold per hour.
---
Looking ahead to the new year! 
---
It's nothing!
---
:D
---
No expansion announcement, nobody cares. Sad to see how low they've set the bar now. I've seen small indie companies kick out five times the content this group does, it's pitiful. Mike Z must go and they need a real game director with some vision if they hope to save this franchise!
---
Do you not see how "We're trying to elevate the skills of these folks so they would be able to perform the work with us" and "If we were interested in lowering the bar we'd hire underqualified folks. We don't do that" contradict one another?
---
You're saying that you're hiring people who aren't qualified and do not posses the skills to perform the work you need, and you're hoping to train them into becoming qualified.
---
I actually had to laugh at how pitiful this road map is,
---
That they think 'Warlcaw balance' and adding a new adventure to lunar new year is even approaching content worthy to be announced is hilarious
---
But i'm still holding out for that 'ray of hope'
---
\*Aquaman fandom intensifies\*
---
BTW: were you doing T4 fractals 1-2 days ago with a psychadelic warrior who kept ranting about Tiny Charr? Your name seems familiar.
---
You're saying that you're hiring people who aren't qualified and do not posses the skills to perform the work you need, and you're hoping to train them into becoming qualified at some unspecified point after you hire them.
---
They certainly are taking a big dump on the mythos behind human gods that's been built in GW1. I remember a time when I hoped for more throwbacks to GW1, but I now just want them to stop digging up GW1 NPC/mythos and butchering them for short-term excitements.
---
2000 Gems to join an alliance, coming 2025
---
Sad to say, but this game is on maintenance mode. Look at content updates for FFXIV or ESO and you will quickly realize just how content dry this game has become (or really has been for a while now). The latest LW episode was literally 2 hours of content (and that includes the story playthrough).
---
&gt;I'm really glad they confirmed there will be the same repeating festival in January
---
FTFY.
---
But the warclaw made life of gankers slightly more difficult so "own territory" and "evades 3 whole times like a regular Daredevil" getting nuked. I bet we'll get a "compensation" in form of crap-mastery like "get 3 seconds of regeneration upon being dismounted" :P 
---
And then power balance will again bleed over from WvW into pve and makes pug life there a new hell (cause none of fractal/raids will be adjusted ever)
---
Oh well :(
---
Yes! There will be another post with more info.
---
Story of literally any group content in any MMO that is neither hard (not difficult - required) DPS check nor glorified puzzle.
---
If you weren't worried about the game's direction (or realized it's being put on maintenance mode) after that disastrous live announcement event, you weren't looking.
---
Do you not see how 
---
&gt;"We're trying to elevate the skills of these folks so they would be able to perform the work with us" 
---
-and-
---
&gt;"If we were interested in lowering the bar we'd hire underqualified folks. We don't do that" 
---
-contradict one another?
---
lmao
---
lol. I found one in this [thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/edcu4i/looking_ahead_to_the_new_year/fbhaemm/)
---
And you guys wonder why people seem to be ditching the game. When you tell people to fuck off and they do, you can't really wonder why the game seems to be dying.
---
A lot of people will look at this and be very pleased with it. If you're not holding your breath for a new raid or fractal, that's actually quite a packed three months for GW2 and the new episode arrives next month.
---
There is no "the community". I'm sure a lot of instanced group content players will be disappointed, maybe even some WvW people will be sad the restructure is still 3+ months away, but for everyone else that's actually a pretty good showing compared to competing MMOs.
---
Wouldn't they just say it's a fractal then?
---
Chef can craft them and some maps have dyes as reward - chceck wiki which one.
---
And one of the big reasons why we are where we are today.
---
Don't forget, and don't forgive.
---
Let me tell you about Swiss tournaments
---
&gt; Visions of the Past
---
This sounds like more stuff posted on their website that most players will never see.
---
I just thought about it yesterday: we have a mount for jumping. We have a mount for going fast. We have a mount to fly. We have a mount to swim ON water. The only missing is one for swimming below the surface
---
u/FarSeat6 I'm saying we \*don't\* hire underqualified people. Mentorship isn't a job and it isn't the guarantee of a job with us or anyone else. It's merely a way that people can get supported and bridge their skill gap if they demonstrate screenwriting or narrative design talent but lack certain necessary skills that are required by prospective employers.
---
Warriors, what have you done ?   
---
They fixed your damn flags ... But the price to pay was as high as closing Wintersday Jumping Puzzle (at least) ...
---
I dont think you know what you're talking about man
---
Episode 1 was weirdly less compelling than the prologue, so I'm hoping the best stuff was held back for episode 2. I think WvW guilds will continue to decline (just like casual PvP audience declines in every aging game - Overwatch, LoL, CS Go etc) until the restructure. Depending on how the restructure lands, WvW could see a big resurgence for a while, especially if that frees them up to do more WvW events to bring in fresh blood.
---
Just like LOCH overestimated their chances by taking part in ERP3?
---
Couldnt help myself, sorry.
---
The pixel prestige in this game is ridiculous. "Heeeerrrrb durrr I know my rotations better than the these casuals, I'm so much better at this game than youuuuu"
---
Does not work. 
---
What class gets to get their Specs last? What class players do you want to ear complaining that they have to wait for last? Warrior? Necro? Guardian? 
---
Ok, so you might say, "Release one trait/skill at a time for each class?" 
---
Does not work. Then you have PvP and WvW players, Raiders, etc that can't use the whole thing for YEARS while it releases at a snail pace. And we've already got WvW players used to being able to just unlock their new elite spec in SECONDS with tokens. 
---
It has to be all or nothing or they just make it worse.
---
how tf can they still find new ways to ruin warclaw and catter even more to the cancerous but vocal players who call themselves roamers ?
---
These people are delusional as hell and need to play FF14 for 1-2 months to see what's missing.   
---
I'm not asking for FF14-level of quantity of course. But holy shit the gap is wider than Montana.
---
They don't know how to balance the elite specs we currently have. I wouldn't expect any new ones.
---
How is it different from a standard unpaid internship then?
---
sounds like a great opportunity to move other people to those projects (I really hope that isn't the case but I wouldn't be shocked)
---
Yeah, I didn't like doing the combat achievements in them but they were good from a narrative PoV. I really enjoyed the bonus mission pack in GW1 and it was very similar. There is a lot of opportunity to tell stories we couldn't otherwise tell, like the legend of Asgeir, or what happened to Almorra or, as others suggested, Malyck's story.
---
Yeah I know but this seems to be worse than I thought :&lt;
---
Yea now we want the content of the roadmap
---
We're doing more of the same story and festivals content, but this time we have a new kind of story that is named different but it is the same. We also removed some content like endgame pve because only a few of you cared about, but hopefully you'll be glad with our amazing storytelling we have a handful of fresh new characters we introduced so that we can kill them and shock you soon. We're also keeping the promise that soon you will hear promises for the competitive game modes, except we forgot to mention some promises that you may hopefully forget about. See you all and enjoy the gem store!
---
You can't be serious...
---
WoW at least has an xpack every 2 years and adds maps worth more than a day of gameplay.
---
8.3, a major patch, with \*casual\* content equal maybe to a half that of GW2's season + new dungeon and raid releases in under a month. (not sure if it will bring a new map or not)
---
Festivals in WoW sure are more frequently updated than the copypaste we get here each year. (+ there are many more of them)
---
And no blizzard did not pay me, BfA fucking sucks hence why I am not playing it but at least the game got an xpack.
---
I never said they should release some elite specs first, then others later. I meant releasing part of them (As in, 1/3 of the traits and slot skills), then release the rest later.
---
Might have worded it better, I guess.
---
While spending all gems money
---
It's a roadmap for Q1 2020. Obviously none of the things you mentioned are on the books for Q1 so it makes sense they don't talk about them.
---
Because that would make sense
---
It sounds like a good idea for those are interested in writing and to get advice from people who have been writing for so long can really help. It must be extremely satisfying being able to help those interested in the medium to teach them everything you have learnt.
---
I can't wait for all the new gemstore stuff!
---
:pepehands: I blame Timo
---
If only you guys could apply that to the sub as well. You won't be missed.
---
Same here, it's kinda sad they abandoned it pretty much right after it was released.
---
Classic ArenaNet.
---
Why does it feel like they had a specialist corporate team come in and manage the game? Nothing feels sincere or genuine.
---
Why so they can add more imbalance for players to qq more about?
---
I'm having this exact same issue. Did you happen to find a fix ? I've tried most everything I can find on support forums with no luck.
---
Chrono WvW changes will never be undone.
---
One can hope.
---
&gt; either reveal your cards now, or people will move along
---
This so much. The mounts/elites leak for PoF did *waaay* more for their marketing than anything ANet did on its own. If it's stuff without a definitive projection, at least say what it is and that it's on the way.
---
But warclaw is mostly WvW thing -- we have raptor that has long jump and sand doggo for evade/blinking around. Would it really be that useful, especially as in pve it already didn't have bonus dodges (and WvW ones are being removed "for balance" -- I guess people were upset that Lance could be dodged).
---
&gt; I meant releasing part of them (As in, 1/3 of the traits and slot skills), then release the rest later.
---
Again; 
---
&gt; Does not work. Then you have PvP and WvW players, Raiders, etc that can't use the whole thing for YEARS while it releases at a snail pace. And we've already got WvW players used to being able to just unlock their new elite spec in SECONDS with tokens.
---
&gt; It has to be all or nothing or they just make it worse.
---
I‚Äôve been playing the same maps for 8 years with the exception of the desert map which got added later. The warclaw makes the desert map pretty good now and people are liking it more. Well thought out content would be welcomed. The problem with the desert map before warclaw is that you spent more time running around doing nothing than defending or fighting
---
Seems like it is now confirmed the game is in narrative maintenance mode
---
Can we have actual balance before adding new elites to be OP like Mirage and Scourge again?
---
"finally, they showed a roadmap. oh, thats their roadmap? oh."
---
I do not wonder about anything. People have been asking, both politely and by bitching nonstop, about a roadmap, they finally got it and are still spitting poison.
---
Yeah, I am sorry people are so stubborn and haven't learnt the simple lesson after all these years - Guild Wars 2 wasn't, isn't, and won't be their precious giga-mega-ultra MMO. It has always been a theme park type of thing, you download it, you play for a bit, get bored, delete it or stop logging in for some time and then come back once you read something new was added to it.
---
I just feel like proximity-based limitations will only promote clouding which isn't any more interesting than zerging IMO.  Plus it actually takes a good amount of teamwork to fight off an entire map queue cloud if you are in a group of say 25.  With no center of mass to bomb, constant damage and CC from all sides to sustain through.  People sitting off to the side on mounts waiting to finish anyone who goes down.  Yet with your proposal, the 25 would be nerfed and it would be even harder.
---
i played on and off since launch, on my third legendary, i only play one toon
---
ive found having multiple goals (HOPE, Aurora, pvp leg armor) and jumping between them keeps me engaged. im in no rush to get any one thing, and playing in different areas of the game keeps things fresh.
---
My point was more that their 'roadmap' is more aggressive looking than what you said and we'll still probably have delays etc.  I wasn't intending to imply that it would be better or worse - just the latest intentions we heard around cadence.
---
eXpAnsIoN-liKe fEaTurES
---
People dont get "into" strikes. There is zero prep for a strike, you queue and can go with any amount of skill, group comp, etc. This is not a raid, it is a 10man open world encounter.
---
oh you sweet summer child you are in for a treat
---
Wouldn't that just be unnecessary spaghetti code if the mount is split balanced between game modes?
---
&gt; Visions of the Past - it's just living world, sounds like content that isn't added into an episode, now added under a new name to make it look special
---
it's basically current events under a new name to trick us it's smth new, lmao
---
Ah yes, because using the wrong words is such a good idea to describe a situation. That already helped since players already confuse viable with optimal...
---
Also, where did my comment say anything about "ignoring" something? But I imagine that is just you reading too much into the situation again.
---
Ok, i see. thanks. anyway,  it finally started working after 2 hours and half a day.
---
What are you talking about? It specifically mentions it is a new type of story mission in the game, where you will play as another character and experience a bit of their backstory.
---
&gt; Well, it's a preview of sorts, 3 months ahead. It's a step forward.
---
Now is the time for big swings and giant leaps, not small, tentative steps forward.
---
They have several thousands of hours played already because the game started out with a lot of content and HoT brought a fair amount more content into the game. 
---
The issue isn't that people play too much, we're used to having X and X things to do. Those things are disappearing as Anet lowers their qualities of updates over the span of these last 2-3 years.
---
Less raids got released over the time of their existence. 
---
In the first 12 months of raid releases we got 3 raid wings with the fourth releasing shortly after the initial 12 month window. 
---
There was almost an entire year between the fifth and sixth raid wing. 
---
Development is slowing.
---
Players are just as interested as they have been, but sadly this game is entering maintenance mode.
---
As PoF becomes more and more deserted, I've solo'd many of the metas using the sand doggy and it's barrier. Super useful
---
&gt; WoW at least has an xpack every 2 years and adds maps worth more than a day of gameplay.
---
WoW relies VERY heavily on time gates and grinds. How much of the "content" of WoW is repeating the same world quests for more AP, or more faction rep, or higher ilvl gear? When you boil WoW down to unique content (quests and stories) and you remove the "kill 10 rats" quests, it's not that different from GW2 or similar MMOs.
---
Yes there are more rewards to earn in WoW, but that's the difference between a sub and buy to play. The closest comparison to GW2's business model is ESO and it does similar rewards distribution (primarily rewards go in the cash shop over the game).
---
WoW's 8.3 is a few invasions on old maps, a new raid, a new solo mission type and allied races. It's in no way close to an entire GW2 season, let alone an episode of GW2 (this is the WoWHead article: https://www.wowhead.com/guides/visions-of-nzoth-content-overview-bfa).
---
PvE isn't competitive so it obviously isn't going to be prioritized. 
---
A lot of new balance stuff affects the whole game.
---
the problem isnt that strike missions are a thing, its that its replacing raids and fractal content, essentially killing the last remaining endgame content
---
That's.. what the average GW2 player wants in a nutshell. Shame too, given the potential of the combat system.
---
Q1 road map with biggest item (episode2) coming end of jan...is there anything else in feb and March?
---
Going from 1 festival straight to another festival is going to make a lot of people stop playing.
---
&gt; A lot of people will look at this and be very pleased with it.
---
Even many of the story-only players will be unhappy to see a "coming soon" blogpost in place of a legitimate roadmap.
---
There are separate balance teams now - PvE balance will be handled by the old team, while competetive modes now have their own dedicated team as well.
---
fractals never
---
Anet and wasting potential.
---
wow that's generous, that's assuming this company is gonna have another four years
---
^^ this guy thinks other people are the toxic ones KEKW
---
It worked better when we were Pact Commanders. We weren't the only ones, we had superiors and we didn't do everything on our own. Things we weren't involved in still got done (the branches in the personal story you didn't choose still happen because parts of them turn up later in the story even if you didn't play that path) and frequently other NPCs are calling the shots.
---
Becoming a leader of our own team and guild of similarly pointless nobodies is where the story went off the rails. Dragon's Watch was a mistake, just like the biconics. Guild Wars 2 is chained to characters that constantly hold the story back, not strengthen it.
---
I dont even understand why they wanna work on the warclaw, its doing what its supposed to be and is fine imo.
---
&gt; the story has nothing to do with GW2
---
With the way the writing has aggressively "resolved" GW1's plot points, that's about the only way to move forward.
---
It was terrible. 
---
If, _if_ they just had to add a mount to sell skins, then it should have been the [War Dolyak](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Dolyak_Master) as already established in lore. It would have been slow, but had a crap ton of HP and been immune to CC. Most importantly, rather than running you all over the map really fast, it would have allowed us to _finally tow and move Siege._ 
---
# That would have fucking fit WvW far better, not the shit we got and never asked for!
---
And they're the same characters all the time. At least GW1 gave us a new team every expansion.
---
that would require better upper management first, realizing their mistakes and damage they do.
---
&gt;FF14-level of quantity
---
Hour-long story, small raid wing after 7 months of content drought, one DOA braindead dungeon, crafting, crafting, crafting, crafting, timegated welfare epic. Where's quantity?
---
Good thing we reminded you!
---
Well they already said they there's not raids/fractals for like 9 months upwards
---
More like "about time" üòÑ We're a little late this year, but hopefully the new site will make up for that. Happy to have you participating!
---
It's not like EP2 can't have a fractal though.
---
Which is a single player game with giant mmo maps ? Yeahhhhbbbb.
---
Exactly everyone know Swiss only affects the tiny minority of players that do AT, but some reason people keep harping about it. The balance and reworks will be the key to get PvP players back.
---
Never understood how people can average 6+ hours a day. Not being judgemental, I just don't quite get the logistics of it. Between work, family, other hobbies, and other video games, I don't even play this game every week.
---
they hero we dont deserve
---
After so many years of mistakes, the company will die before they're long gone.
---
keep living in your bubble...
---
No, they did not.
---
They haven't confirmed nor denied anything of the sort.
---
Yeah I agree with this. I do think the evasiveness is too high but I think speed is fine.
---
I hope they find some other way to make it relevant.
---
I never cared for the dye market in GW2. GW1 was basic, but there was a way to farm dyes (even the rare black or white dyes) in pre-searing ascalon... Ah, the good ol days
---
Disagree, I don‚Äôt think everyone knows..
---
you mean the next 6 months?
---
I mean it's clear from the road map that endgame PvE is no longer going to be developed and open world can be done on pretty much any class and any build so there really isn't any balance required there.
---
To be fair they should have included balance update under the WvW header too. Not sure why they didn't.
---
Still feels a bit smaller than episode 2 though lol.
---
Balthazar, I've come to bargain.
---
you can still receive stuff as f2p, right? just have someone send you a bunch of super cheap ones, maybe make a list or something
---
i'm sure you'll find someone willing to help
---
28th? so its offical, this "saga"' is one big bullshit. We are getting same update speed but now with even less content, instead of 1 map and story only half of normal episodes. GAME IS OFFICIALY DEAD
---
Well it makes sense. This 'am i the baddie?' plot thread had serious potential. And we all know what Anet does with potential!
---
That game is nothing without raids. The story isn't even properly voice acted in 2019 and that's just pathetic c grade effort.
---
Here's the thing - you'll never balance WvW no matter how good it is for PvE and PvP, because WvW is won by coverage, period. 
---
And PvP matches are 90% won or lost by rotations, not builds or skill. 
---
So they might as well pop em out and make people happy there and at least come back to play for a while.
---
Cutscenes are voice acted. Even with the quality drops between sections of the game, there's still more quality put into that game each year than Anet adds to theirs. 
---
At core, Gw2 is better by miles. Development? C Tier for Anet, A Tier for the 14 dev team.
---
What do you expect for a company that calls Loadouts "Templates"?
---
4 scourges will not safe one monkey on arkk which dont know how to dodge orbz.
---
My buddy in NA The camera rotation issue this two nights ago and found out windows was running an update in the background.  The next day, issue was resolved 100%.
---
It's not even registering as being played in history
---
Well It's good to know there won't be any new fractals or raids, at least I can try some other game :)
---
It's always done that though.
---
There are a lot of people like you in reddit, the official forums, and internet in general.

Rare positive comment : Thanks for communication , its been 5 years and i still love this game so much . I will support it whenever i can , i want this to continue . Community needs an expansion tho , and alliances . Please rush it , because community can endure some bugs instead of less content
---
I am looking forward to the big balance patch. If you multi class balance patches actually bring a lot of content if you pvp a lot. If you just play one class it can be a bit of a roulette though.
---
Pve wise I am apathetic with GW2, and don't feel like raging.
---
Let's use me as an example. At the launch of GW2, I saw myself as a social outcast at school. Most of my friends were online. GW2 was far above and beyond anything I had seen before and had a deep world for me to explore and learn about. I was still only in high school and most of my hobbies had me in front of a computer anyway. It was easy to prioritize GW2 over anything else since not much in my life really mattered to me.
---
So really, at that time in my life, I was probably averaging 6-8 hours a day as I would log on shortly after school and go well into the night with it. I don't *entirely* see those hours as *wasted* back then, since I had a lot of quality time with friends, but obviously my quality of fun and time spent in the game decreased as those friends left.
---
I don't play much anymore, though I'll admit I kept high playtime for a while out of sheer longing for the old days. It's a habit I'm glad I broke.
---
Not to say everyone with such high playtimes has the same background as me, but that's just one example to offer some perspective.
---
Bye Felicia?
---
Keep the speed low, but give it reduced agro radius when it walks. Sneaky kitty!
---
Is it surprising that the episode comes in Q1?
---
I guess I'll just play FFXIV or just quit MMOs. Aside from the every 2-3 months of content for about an hour or two.
---
nice ad
---
I'd rather them spend those resources elsewhere.  It's never going to have a PvE niche unless it gets something really unique.
---
Nice video though the hard jumping puzzle only gives 12 wintersday gifts per completion now :&lt;
---
Its kind of funny that now they see why the community thought mounts were such a bad idea to begin with in WvW.  The only real reason to have them is to make sure everyone doesn't need to stack swiftness to get across the map.
---
Still 0 mention about the restructure.  They are literally in maintenance mode for WvW.  Even when the restructure update launches, it'll furthermore prove my point because it'll be balancing populations which means even less work for them.
---
Its just embarrassing that they don't even play their game enough to realize that balance updates and the warclaw aren't the main problems with the game mode.
---
At least New World is starting to look promising?
---
how 3 months is faster then 2-3 months? And it is NOT expanding maps, they take a full map and cut it in half!. This is not full map expanding at all. Come on man. Saga is even less content then living world 3
---
Tends to happen if your status is set to invisible.
---
I'm also aware of this. Which is why the majority of this post is dedicated to speaking about the game and how I felt about the people that play it. You  c an simply  choose to   click or not  click. the only words you are subjected to are in relation to the game.
---
That is interesting to see, I've been farming this JP for years and never really thought about how people were doing it.
---
The best thing about this video is that even though you are doing a JP as a Charr! you don't have armor on that will cover up half of any other player's screen. Thanks for that :)
---
i want job in wvw team anet,my job for 6 months whoud be nerf one mount.
---
No PvE will still get balance but it will be separate from WvW and PvP which is being handled by the competitive team.
---
&gt; People who think they know what they're talking about, but actually don't.
---
Saying there is a team and having that team actually focus on balance are different things.
---
We've reached a point where I can't tell if your comment is full of cynicism or white-knighting...
---
Great, even more mediocre story and no mention of any group content. Seems like even fractals, which were supposed to be main 5-man content, are joining dungeons in the graveyard.
---
Its a teaser not a trailer hence it being short.
---
They should have made WvW versions of the PvE mounts, instead of a second reskin of the griffon. What's the point of the warclaw if it's useless in PvE?
---
&gt; emptiest road map I've ever seen
---
No way you have seen Anthem roadmap.
---
[I guess I got what I was asking for.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ecsv8l/disappointment_changes_controversy_and_hope/fbdr6qw/)
---
Alright so your quitting right say yes and everyone can officially ignore you.
---
Its Drakkar.
---
the one thing that was reasonable from the very beginning was that ANet made it absolutely clear that this is a wvw only mount, and the ability to use it outside of that is only to give enthusiasts an option to RP or whatever around its appearance. work put into it was only ever going to be based on wvw. i'd rather have them deactivate it entirely in PvE rather than ANet wasting resources on split balance for it.
---
it's a *wvw* mount that you are allowed to use elsewhere. that's it.
---
No sir, you are simply trying to manipulate and cheat mods into allowing personal drama post disguised as game related message.
---
I love Caith missions.
---
That's not true though. It's the first time I ever see something like this happening.
---
Are you using jealousy (justified or not) of WvW players as an argument for why the mount shouldn't be balanced for PvE? Come on.
---
only when it messes up. as NA and EU people literally cannot join each other without switching regions there is no point in the LFG showing parties and squads from the other region.
---
Again, if the "balance patches" are Pvp/WvW and other patches are episode/story patches, when exactly will there be PvE balance patches? It used to be that balance patches included all game modes. The last one was and this announcement makes it seem like the next one will be as well. Its going to be, what, half a year until things shift in PvE (at best)?
---
agree, SAGA is even less content then season 3. This is full maintance mode, they are taking normal episodes and cut map and story in half to be able to slow down even more and turn normal 1 episode into 2. This is sad.
---
It didn't have a very big impact on PvE. But it completely deleted Scourge from any competitive environment on PvP.
---
But you get the idea. In some cases it's not possible to do PvP/WvW-centric changes without also thinking about other game modes.
---
lmao. I applaud your efforts, I really do. You're speaking to somebody that was on the Something Awful forums in 1999. Your trolling is respected but not welcome here.
---
You know not my intentions. You aren't inside my head. Therefore you have no right to tell me what I intend to do.
---
&gt; My ultimate goal is to strip Power of Attorney from my mother
---

---

---
Erm, this isnt GW2 related, then, is it? This is between you and your. . . Mother. About SMA Powder, I'm guessing.
---
At this point all I can do is laugh. I literally do not even get angry anymore at these Anet posts. As a WvW player, we expect nothing more than this level of a trash update...excuse me, 'update.' Q1 has what appears to be a strong focus on 'looking at warclaw' because you realized now that it's too obnoxious in this game mode. So the best idea is to for sure reduce its speed but not address a more important and obvious issue which are warclaw stomps. I cannot wait to see what Q2 brings. Probably another statement saying, ' major balance update is coming - stay tuned.' Honestly, how many more times are you going to tell us literally the same thing you've been telling us about this 'major balance?'
---
Also, I refuse to elaborate on my "drama post" for such reasons, as you trying to goad me into doing.
---
It does look like a large predator, so maybe even make it so that below vet rank mobs no longer aggro you at all while on the warclaw. Solves the "I can't explore because there are mobs constantly attacking me" while giving up on the speed other mounts provide.
---
I *think* they made most mobs below veteran rank passive after multiple complaints, but there are still some left especially on DBL (fire keep), would be a very small benefit in the gamemode it was intended for as well.
---
yeah it might be a bit op in PvE
---
there is no more active development, team 4th was doing another smaller living world, some extra story instances. Its nothing. Nothing new. Its some extra talking and some boring easy combat. No raids, no other content. Strike missions are ok but they are boss taken from open world and story. And new episodes are normal episodes cut in half to make 2 episodes from 1. They are doing everything possible to not work on the game. Its maintance mode. They dont want to make content. They want to make it look like they are doign new content, so people will still buy gems. They are milking the game hard one last year. GAME IS HARD IN MAINTANCE MODE, GAME IS DEAD
---
Maybe?  They are working with limited resources.  Whichever mount an open-world-PvEer decides to bust out to get to the next world boss is low on my priority list, sorry.
---
GW2 has always been about playing a story simulator, not sure why people are surprised.
---
Not any the store.
---
[The gem store.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IMR8cS2qjU)
---
I rarely take banners in normal t4s already, only during low mobility boss fights. The +400 stats is always nice to have and the 2 extra utility slots doesnt matter that much if fights are short
---
Fƒ±nd 19 pearls in the map. Then find 21 shells in the map. Then find 20 fins in the map. See you tomorrow!
---
You already pay that or more to change servers, so don't be surprised if we get ripped off for that or more.
---
PvP: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=SDeGt-v5amU
---
WvW: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8Es3jjGf8Mw
---
True, but would it even be worth using over other PvE mounts at that point?  Raptor would still be a better version of the Warclaw.  I was working on the assumption that it would need something fairly unique to be considered useful in PvE, and I don't trust them to be able to do that without breaking it again in WvW.
---
At this point, including the warclaw in wvw was just a big waste of time. I do love the extra speed (who know how much extra it will be after these nerfs....) but think of all the work they are wasting to create, then nerf something to not be as impacting to competitive.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs pretty much gone. Aside from the occasional change. There‚Äôs little to no reason to think PVE content will see balance changes. Since only strike missions and open world content are being released and those don‚Äôt need much balance changes. Mostly only challenging content needs balance changes.
---
The game will die before they balance things properly. You need to keep moving forward or people will leave you behind.
---
It always did, all you had to do to see other region was to be invisible.
---
I wish they merged Molten and Aetherblade and remade them in the guise of Nightmare Fractal, but hey, that's asking too much, I guess.
---
&gt; looks like a solid update touching lots of different game modes 
---
Yeah that warclaw rebalance is such a solid WvW update /s
---
Pointless if rewards are as shitty as the strikes so far.
---
Swiss tournaments need to be best out of 3. To be really meaningful.
---
Should have spent that time bringing back LW1 instead.
---
&gt;  Raptor would still be a better version of the Warclaw
---
Hmm I guess so because of the jump. An option could be making it slightly faster then to compensate. Anyway, I'm sure that if it wasn't totally useless more people would use it because cat &gt; dinosaur haha
---
Can i have WvW specific mastery for raptor, bunny, teleportwolf, griffon, rollerbeetle and Warclaw as well?
---
And consider how many bugs the warclaw have today (over 50 at least and not a single one have been fixed since it came out) imagine how many you will add just by having different skills on a mount for PvE that is made for WvW. So no thanks.
---
Not really, end game is used for both. So you are not wrong saying those things are also end game but you are wrong for saying "not end game content".
---
End game usually means either content available as you reach last level or the pinnacle (hardest/most rewarding/current tier) of content. Either is fine to use.
---
~~Season~~ Saga
---
~~Raids~~ Strikes
---
~~Fractals of the Mists~~ Visions of the Past
---
*ponder*
---
You don't like the sub? Why don't you leave? KEK
---
The only thing the warclaw did was draw players into a new game mode only get literally told to fuck off by the playerbase of that game mode. Team chat was raging about the new players.
---
I wish fist weapons were a thing. Or any new weapons, to be fair :(.
---
&gt;To me WoW is an anomaly that was a thousand times copied, but never reproduced.
---
I think that basically just boils down to momentum, incumbent advantage and the anchoring effect that MMOs have. 
---
There is likely a number of WoW clones that were objectively better games, but never went anyway because the long-term investment people have in WoW keeps them shackled to the game.
---
&gt;And a MMO with millions of players is mainstream to me, nothing that has passed. Yes, MOBAs have bigger numbers and zoomers don't have the attention span for elaborate worlds, doesn't mean that a game with 5++ million players isn't mainstream.
---
I'd argue it's relative, 5M isn't that significant in terms of being mainstream or not if the figure of 250M for Fortnite is to be believed from a cursory Google.
---
They already sold the skins they could, time to abandon project.
---
&gt;NOW IM PISSED
---
You and me both, but for different reasons.
---
On a totally unrelated, less serious topic, are those boxing gloves coming back?
---
That's what GW3 should be, imo. GW2 assets recycled into a new game, in a different setting, with a different story.
---
then people will just stand and wait to get killed so they can wp
---
When was there a "7 month content drought"? Their patches are released like clockwork, they don't even have a break between the last patch and a new expansion launch.
---
i dont know where you take your "facts" since there is no universal set in stone definition.
---
since this conversation is starting to turn dark with insulting eachother, i am cutting this off here.
---
People have been saying its just for a quarter since the layoffs.
---
Raids and fractals, the content we used to get.
---
No what i am saying is that, they are correct that the current end game content is being killed if their assumption is true and they use end game as 2nd usage.
---
There was a time end game content (in this context) was speed running dungeons. It changes as game changes, for better or worse is up to opinion.
---
And again within this context, open world farming is not end game, neither is achievement hunting. Those are however end game content if you use the context of the first meaning.
---
Hope that clears what i am saying.
---
yes, its not overpowerd in any way, just buff to speed up progress. its just worrying because its an unique buff locked behind the gem shop and therefor a step into more dangerous p2w territory.
---
Oh shit if the new player says so, anet u got to do it. You got no choice now, new player wants a 1v1 like arcage or blade &amp; soul or 2v2 like wow.
---
Warclaw should only have 25% speed boost and help carry supply , maybe buff the door attack 
---
But I agree warclaw is one reason I stopped, plus the balance is still awful
---
I mean everyone told them ahead of time that it was problematic. They need to think of a better underlying system for WvW "masteries". And while mounts in WvW are a good idea, they shouldn't work like this.
---
and how you know it is in active development? Not a single proof they are doing anything asside of story. In season 3 we know PoF is comming, in season 4 we know season 5 is comming. Now they dont want to talk about anything. We know new raids and fractals were comming, no no word. There is not a single thing to be exited anymore. Even build templates which were suppose to be amazing turn into ugly cash grab. We know they will be monetized but we hoped to at least be able to unlock them for all characters or to get 4-5 free. We ddint get a single free one as the 3 free ones were stolen from pvp an wvw.  But lets not get back to that... The problem is we cant by hyped anymore. Guild are dead, raids dead, wvw dead. Everything is on last breath. Its agony
---
Raids...PvP...Fractal CMs...older maps...
---
It did but I liked all the spec and the story were kind of heavy (even if it was a bit fanbase like)
---
And the achievements, especially with the griffons, were nice I think
---
&gt;They said they are still making dungeons   
---
&gt;but they explicitly said there will release another dungeon 
---
They absolutely did NOT say this.   
---
Seriously, what are you smoking?
---
Perfect
---
...in response to the outcry for a roadmap. The fact that "we" asked for a road map and were given this instead is a microcosm of what we've come to expect from Anet as a whole.
---
I saw you doing this yesterday and thought, ‚Äúthe madlad is dodging THROUGH the snowballs what‚Äù. Risky stuff I won‚Äôt do, but more power to you.
---
what a pathetic and sad look into the future. still waiting on even one "expansion level" piece of content or system.
---
Hansen, you have your work cut our for you here. Good luck!
---
That‚Äôs what I meant, should have clarified. Unfortunately a lot of people left GW2 and won‚Äôt be going back.
---
That's a simple issue of balance. But the whole idea of WvW, at least a huge aspect of it, is kind of shit all over when you allow players to mount up and sprint away at any given point. If you travel away from your own territories and your group, you do so at your own peril.
---
Saves effort on development too. Dont need to design an interesting map. Dont need characters or a story.
---
GW2 is the story of a great game, and one of the best mmo/rpg ever made, poorly managed that survived only because of its over casualisation, the hope of the people and poor competition in the mmo/rpg genre. posts like these exists since before the release of HOT but little have changed. 
---
HOT made so much noise when it came out because everyone was hungry for more GW2 content but the disapointments came one after another. (the new WvW was a disaster. sPvP had a big esl competition coming out at that time but HOT was an unbalanced buggy mess. the new spvp gamemode had good ideas but was ultimately trash and abandoned. masteries took ages to grind and forced you to grind content just to unlock a few feature. the story was aweful. the dragon boss fight was better than zhaitan but less satisfying and its open world version a big joke. guild hall was a grind fest and a gold sink. guild arena too limited for organised GvG. NO REAL GvG !!. gliders were cool and the new maps were great except for the last one. the first raids were really cool but the reward shitty).
---
but the worst part was character progression. after reaching a certain point your characters won't evolve anymore. HOT did nothing about that except adding some new gear stats .
---
and after that? dungeons died for good. fractals got some love then became a routine for the 20 gold daily (or was it weekly?) rush and then forgotten. WvW came back to what it was and stopped any evolution whatsoever despite some new feature here and there that were scrapped soon after (shame). sPvP died for good when esl competition stopped in GW2.
---
only new raids came out with some new boring living story and new legendary weapons story only a tiny percentage of people actually did and enjoyed them. the only solid content we got each 3 months was new gem skins (they were beautifull btw) and some minor fixes and balance changes.
---
after playing all GW2 content all you could do was grind for success like a steam success collector maniac..
---
no matter how nice POF was its content was already less than half of what we got for HOT. it should already gave you a warning on the state of the game and its direction.
---
i have already stopped playing gw2 for more than a year now (or 2 i can't remember) and i did it with sadness in my heart. GW2 was my first big mmo/rpg and while i did played other mmos while taking breaks from the game i always came back because the experience was so much better here than other there.
---
gg to the ones who made each new maps and the soundtracks. they really did a great job. even the WvW map was gorgeous but not adapted to its game mode. honestly GW2 has the best looking and designed maps for any MMO/RPG ever created.
---
RIP  Tybalt.
---
now is the time to say goodbye :)
---
i miss the book
---
New Update: Warclaws are merely cosmetic and do literally nothing. Buy more skins?
---
I‚Äôd actually love that. I‚Äôd expect not until we hit the deep sea though, then we‚Äôd get 3-4 sea mounts
---
Visions of the past is 100% season 1 right? Like that‚Äôs entirely what it is...right?
---
&gt;Give me 1 reason be be exited about gw2.......... you cant.
---
Hi. I'm not gw1996. But i've been with this franchise a while, and it's the only MMORPG I can really be bothered to get into and stick with.
---
I want to play because I like feeling part of the world. I like the Charr. No other IP has feline beastlike humanoids like this, and I like the aesthetic, and lore. Getting distracted by the bigger things, like the company's pushed marketing side is only going to make me feel sad, and angry. Probably a lot like you are. 
---
But I forget any of that, because i've learnt recently that thinking about the "big picture" is sometimes really, frustratingly mentally taxing. Politics in most of the anglosphere is a fucking mess right now, and there are so many likeminded people who are devastated by developments in their countries. So there are people like myself, who use this game, it's lore, it's gameplay, as an escape. And that's okay. We don't concern ourselves about the nitty-gritty of the company because we just don't care. As long as it's still going, and we're getting roughly what we want in a timeframe, we're sufficed. Hell, even if we weren't we'd still probably be okay with it. 
---
Why? GW2 is less of a game and more of a storybook to me. I pick it up, I play it. I take my mind out of the real world and put it in the "utopia" of Tyria, where adversaries can be overcome in a gradual way. And I like that. Sure, the story might occasionally have a new chapter tagged on that I'll love to pieces, but fundamentally I just don't care when it happens. There's always something to come back to, and if there isn't, i'll just do something else. 
---
It's not like GW2 is the only storybook on the shelf, so to speak. Only a very sad person would have one book, and focus exclusively on dissecting the negatives, immaturely defining what is "less than minimal content" and what isn't. 
---
It stands to reason that the thing we're getting updates in are what the *majority of the game population* finds interesting. Not the subreddit, not the forum. Our self-flagellation by whining about the game has very, very minimal impact. Anet are likely only following their internal statistics at this point for good reason, as the vocal minority are the reasons we have so many abandoned modes, for types of gameplay that people who screamed it directly into anet's faces wanted- got bored of- then just left anyway. Their business model clearly doesn't have the finance for that kind of flagrancy anymore, so why should they pull themselves so thin as to bringing new, expensive features to a vast minority? That's not caring for the customers, it's outright, ignorantly damaging the game. If you're part of the minority, you should really just move on. This is literally Anet telling you this *isn't the game for you.*
---
**I'm *excited* to play what I like. If the only thing that excites you is updates, I think you need to take a long hard look in the mirror and consider whether you actually like this game, or just like new, shiny things like some kind of fetid crow** and if you're still hanging around the subreddit, for some ridiculous reason, trying to throw around your impatience and displeasure with the vein hope of feeling *validated*, I can really only pity you. There are *so* much bigger things to be frustrated about in the world- and you choose other people playing video games? Shucks.
---
&gt;Fight and get good or die more
---
You don't get better from dying to 5v1's and such bullshit is the main reason people despise the mode and why it's not getting new blood
---
Reuse same bosses
---
&gt;And after that, we‚Äôll debut a new type of Living World content called Visions of the Past: a story that will take you out of the commander‚Äôs shoes and give you a new perspective on Ryland Steelcatcher‚Äî**along with some unannounced surprises we can‚Äôt wait to unveil‚Ä¶**
---
If the surprise isn't new elite specs and/or raid wings, people are gonna be disappointed.
---
Lay offs are never good thing, no matter how many lies were spread that it's good for gw2. At this point game is free. Take what you want and don't invest any money into it. I don't see myself losing anything at this point.
---
If only bro if only. I'm just being sarcastic about your chances of getting what u want for pvp.
---
Thank you! It's my first Wintersday and it's exactly what I needed.
---
&gt; Give me 1 reason be be **exited** about gw2.......... you cant. 
---
Take a deep breath mate
---
and uninstall
---
You're clearly just trying to vent, for whatever reason, so just go
---
Better yet, go outside and get some air, be exited.
---
I don't think the visions are counted as part of the saga episodes and more of side stories.
---
If they're not saying anything then it's usually bad news.
---
I'm still glad we got a roadmap though.
---
Since the prologue we've had an episode every other month and this looks set to continue that trend (compared to 3-4 months with season 4). What one earth are you talking about?
---
That_shaman teases more than this and he did it months ago.
---
I know, and I'm not nearly as optimistic as I would have been 2-3 years ago about it actually happening, because I'm genuinely worried about the game like a lot of people are right now, but I at least want to consider it as an option. :)
---
wow... warclaw sounds like it will feel completely pointless by how nerfy that talk sounded.
---
Excuse me!
---
They have been saying '' you'll hear more about it in the coming months'' since 2 years ago when it was first announced xd
---
What rewards? RNG time-wasting fodder or the ingots you can get from any chest in the map?
---
Nah fuck the warclaw.
---
This is just sad. I came with no expectations, and still left disappointed. It's hard to even get angry.
---
In the open world pve? preeeeety sure anything outside of WVW is never region locked or server locked for that matter.
---
Seriously, I remember that leaked screenshot of Amnoon was the best piece of news I'd had for a long time when it hit, and then months later the elite spec news was amazing too. Talked about it for a while because of speculation too.
---
Table
---
Don't even try and use evidence and facts in this community. Anet could release an episode every week and people will still say episodes release every 3-4 months.
---
Nor pressing F at the melandru wood nodes while watching the updates of your subscribed youtube channels.
---
The failure of WoW clones is pretty easily explained: why play WoW if you already play WoW. Yeah, it's WoW with a twist - so what. RIFT and co did indeed have quite a population, but it never even came close to WoW. Heh, I should know, I played quite a number of them before I got so tired of the formula that I would've rather stopped MMOs entirely then playing a single additional questhub grinder. GW2 was a blessing.
---
But yeah, if everything below X isn't mainstream, we can easily describe MMOs as never mainstream. I mean, that was my point from the beginning, so I'm really not going to argue it. :D
---
I actually liked the way Swiftness stacking worked pre-mounts.  It incentivized grouping, which is useful in an MMO.  
---
If your goal was to accomplish WvW objectives then swiftness stacking rewarded you for grouping.  If you were playing to solo roam, travel speed wasn‚Äôt as important.
---
Though I think they are probably going to be consider a full "release", as they have stated that there will be more frequent updates, but they won't all be the full episodes we're used to.

Hyperboles rarely get you anywhere.
---
This would be a viable critique if people didn't then turn around and spend 5x as much a month on gems and tell themselves it's a better system because they "did it voluntarily"

What?
---
But it's on the table.
---
The fact that people suggest try to do it on patch or try to do it when map is full to create a new map, instead of anet fixing this bug. I still can't do vision cause of this and I don't have much time to play, I check when I'm online but mostly find it bug. And just gave up on it.

Hopefully it's not "a saga, not like any old living world season before it"

You barely brought him to 50% with the book and he didnt use mist form.
---
I think you‚Äôre missing one simple point for mounts, which ArenaNet has already discussed.
---
The mounts aren‚Äôt meant to just be cosmetically different between them. Each one serves a function and is supposed to play totally differently. Making the only difference between raptor and warclaw being the appearance completely defeats the purpose. This isn‚Äôt world of Warcraft with flavor mount skins that serve no benefit other than bragging rights.
---
There is no reason to have warclaw in PvE because that isn‚Äôt its function. That‚Äôs really all there is to it. If we start altering these things to be cosmetic then the entire structure of mounts is pointless.

543 days and counting since the last fractal was added.

Do visa gift cards not work on this site? I've tried using mine and it won't work
---
THERES SOMETHING IN THE WATEEEER
---
It has nothing to do with swiftness. Anet wanted to sell skins to WvW players regardless of how the mount's gonna impact gameplay.
---
I have been saying this for years! Game turning into interactive movie where you dont even get to have a opinion. Just follow green star and shhh.
---
Considering the length of episode 1, that's half an episode every 3 months.
---
We got whisper in the dark a month ago. Its 1 every two months.
---
Just a lil, iirc. They make sure that in the last fight you have either Caithe or Canach available to help snap you out of Mordremoth briefly winning you over, there's a few lil bits of dialog about how the two of you are holding up, etc. It's nice soft stuff mostly, makes ya empathize with him a lil more in my opinion. You get to see a bit more of his struggles with the whole thing.
---
yep, half an episode every 2 months means a full one every 4 months so the release cadence hasn't changed.  Don't try and tell me Episode 1 was equivalent in length or substance to any of LS3 or LS4 episodes.  It was, at best, half an episode.
---
The real MVP here.
---
They fired some people who worked on some projects. I don't think they ever confirmed axing *all* of their other projects. And that's a good thing, because if they all worked on GW2 it'd mean there's no future for the company, aka no future for the game. Though honestly it looks like there's no future for the game either way.
---
What? Didnt you guys want more story on top of a story? I dont understand what you guys want - Anet2019.
---
No one cares.
---
Vow of Silence is a pretty accurate skill to use here lol. This reminds me, I need to start my GW1 replay
---
only Q1, but yes a little disappointing.
---
just solo it :) there is no real threat except if you're somehow missing both eyes
---
250 freshwater pearls + 250 mystic coins.
---
ye "social" scientist
---
I think we do it's just that a lot of us don't want to face the reality of the situation.
---
I don't buy that one at all.
---
Hey so about those alliances.......
---
Disappointing.
---
The catch is that these builds become less stronger the more poeple are involved in the fight, thats the tradeoff.
---
Honestly looks like one zero is extra.
---
Yeah, happened to me, too. Group barely made it to one heart phase in the full 10 minutes (and that phase was over almost immediately because 4 or 5 people were afk autoattacking the invulnerable body). Then someone tried to solo the entire encounter... when we FINALLY respawned I tried to make it to the entrance and it threw me back in the fight. I /gg'd and just logged for an hour until it dumped me in a new instance where a kind soul rez'd me and I bolted for the door.
---
Fractals were supposed to be on a cadence of one every 6 months (and met that goal for a bit). Now no discussion about them and its been an entire year
---
We getting Warclae nerfs, all i want really so im golden.
---
Which, tbh, cannot be called a teaser like u/KamoteQ21 seems to be saying. We knew back from the PAX stream that Drakkar would play a role in Episode 2. That\_shaman just provided non-GW1 players with a non-obscured look at Drakkar's frozen GW1 model.
---
That\_shaman does occasionally tease stuff, but it's super obscure. Like when he took a picture of his character at Drakkar Spurs just before the Bitterfrost Frontier release, commenting on something completely unrelated to the location. So I would definitely disagree that "that\_shaman teases more than this".
---
Thanks for the data as always.
---
Thanks for the hard work you put into your guides!
---
The map was fun, even if it was short, the story was miles ahead of what we had before, and the strike missions were genuinely good. So yeah I'm looking forward to the next ep. Just because we ain't getting raids/fractals doesn't mean everything else they put out is trash.
---
 Hi looking, I'm Dad!
---
Hard Mode Strikes are not happening because they will ‚Äúsplit the playerbase.‚Äù There‚Äôs a reason why they didn‚Äôt want repeatable raid cms, and probably aren‚Äôt developing any more raids at all. They also clearly view Fractal CMs as a mistake because the last one of those was over two and a half years ago. Hell, just having Fractals at all splits the playerbase into ‚Äúopen world players‚Äù and ‚Äúinstanced endgame players,‚Äù so they might also want to quietly let that die too (like they did with dungeons).
---
This is a glorified open-world solo exploration interactive movie where you only have to spam press F and 1 with optional social interactions that are very minimally rewarding. It‚Äôs time to get used to that.
---
Made it up.
---
Or an Icebrood Shark. If you play it slowly enough, you can see it has Drakkar's basic sihlouette - four fins, a long tail, and a hammerhead-like shaped head. But the fins are too short to be similar to his GW1 model, and it could just be an Icebrood (Hammerhead) Shark.
---
Chances are they are teasing Drakkar's model, though.
---
Here's what's interesting about the tease though: They're showing something swimming *above open water*. If this is the open world map - which Drakkar is confirmed a part of as a meta boss - then they just created new water tech for GW2, as before the water level was always at the Z-Axis, any water above was "fake water" and wouldn't enable underwater skills.
---
Would make sense, given it features the northern end of the new and expanded Drakkar Lake.
---
It seems to me we'll have more of Raven's norn flashbacks about what happened before we got to the Far Shiverpeaks.
