So you can't farm all of Nightfall with one build because they added some complexity to the game with Nightfall? Use something else, there's farming builds for almost every area in the game.
---
---
---
&gt; It seem they are doing what they want and us the gamers are irrelevant.
---

---
We literally asked for global unidentified gear the moment it was introduced with PoF. Right now is a perfect example of the developers listening to feedback and giving us exactly what we asked for. WvW is getting the alliance system, again a case of getting feedback and getting what they asked for.
---
Have all the feelings you want, but ArenaNet clearly does listen to feedback and does deliver on community desires.
---
I don't feel like praising them for something essential that used to be there, was gone for so long and now is seemingly back. Trust is gone and it'll take more than this to regain it I guess.
---
Actually legendary armor has it's own achievement where you have to unlock all three sets. So everything is fine here, imo.
---
But maybe they should change the description of the Legendary Collector achievement to "Soulbind 5 unique Legendary *weapons*".
---
Same. I am probably more apt to praise Anet, but have given it my fair share of Reddit criticism in the past. The only time I've ever been modded on this subreddit is when I was shitposting. 
---
The fact that mods are so adverse to shitposting here does disappoint me. 
---
But I've never known legitimate criticism to be modded.
---
&gt; legendary armor has it's own achievement
---
True, true
---
Oh this is awesome! I wanted this as soon as PoF released
---
I meant modding on the official forums, not on this subreddit.
---
Only time my posts on the official forums got modded was when calling someone out for trolling, or getting in too-heated discussions. Often, those I replied to *also* got modded though, and in the context of trolls, mine was seemingly only modded because the only content was responding to aforementioned trolls.
---
i made a reddit post about a guild on NA grieving tarir and making it fail, it got 300 upvotes and some of the guild got temp bans, same should be applied here even if its one person. if not ban, he should be forced to change servers so he cant ever be on their enemy team or ally.
---
You guys are so nice. If it were me I'd kill the griefer on sight, repeatedly. What can he do? Report? EotM is a PK area after all. 
---
Though I don't GvG, I'll gladly volunteer as lookout and get rid of the guy before he reaches the arena. Fuck griefers. 
---
Then this is going to make T1-4 mats even more expensive. :-(
---
I love that first one. It seems not many people know about it. But don't be selfish and go and help kill the boss if you get there before/as it's being fought, because you standing in the area you're probably scaling it up for the people that are trying. It doesn't take you any more or less time :)
---
I (a 6k hour veteran player) do all of my inventory management on the go, I hardly ever check the TP for anything other than exotics, so yeah I open everything. I also don't do much farming of events in specific zones so the number of _stacks_ of unidentified gear I gather is small..
---
I open / identify / salvage while moving between events. Because a messy inventory bothers me :p
---
Haha yes .. I was never able to get that box..... I would love to find one .. even today.
---
Neither work (skill balance is messed)
---
That's why  I removed bulwark gyro, it was useful but with the people standing in AoEs during world bosses and stuff I had to delete it, I was nearly killed by it during Tequatl, but I'll def try this too, looks pretty good
---
Using the images of the bags on the left side of the inventory screen as targets for drag &amp; drop to move items into bags, including those that are not currently visible.  
---
Mesmer specifically had its phantasm mechanic reworked entirely, making leveling a Mesmer a lot easier since they are much more bursty.
---
We do kill him on sight. He can just run back before we can restart the round though sadly.
---
I'll let other comment threads discuss choice of gear and weapons.
---
I've not been using stomp, but it looks interesting. I would be more swayed by the stab if it was 2 stacks rather than 1.
---
I would choose balanced stance over dolyak signet, and in fact over any over utility skill since it makes you immune to critical hits on top of the pulsing stab. I find the critical hit immunity is just enough for me to go without the endure pain on the bar.
---
My understanding was that shake it off only broke stun on yourself. Have you tested this? The condition removals are also less needed now we have scrappers to convert them to boons instead, so I don't think the skill makes the cut anymore.
---
The other great thing about break enchantments is that it instantly maxes your adrenaline, so if you aren't using bubble as the opener you can instead go F1 leaping in, break enchantments, F2, then whatever. Speaking of hammer, another nice little combo to bear in mind is 4, 5, 2 which can only be escaped by the target if they stunbreak and leverages the 20% extra damage of 2 on controlled targets. If 4 gives no obvious targets then proceed with 4, 2, 3 or 4, 3, 2 instead.
---
If you are instead in sw/axe when you see a target to pick on or you simply don't have the time to do the axe 5, you can go 2(optional), F1, cancel, 4, 3. This is a lot of damage in a short amount of time and you'll still have enough left over quickness to last a full 5 channel.
---
There are guilds on all servers, relocating him would do nothing, he would just grief another guild or the same guild, just from the other side.
---
so he's griefing us being in arena, what are we doing wrong? the eotm arena has been designed PURPOSELY for us to gvg.
---
They did and he just ran back every time. It's not realistic to have someone on lookout during gvg's to keep people like that away. 
---
Yeah I've been pretty abrasive on the forums over the years and I've only been called up a couple times for crossing the line. People seem to want a license to shit on the developers while giving "feedback" and are outraged the moderation doesn't allow them to do so with impunity.
---
The sense of entitlement and the gross offence projected by a lot of the community members during the layoff period was a clear example how disgusting some in this community can be and how unhelpful their contributions often are.
---
Some people seem to think there is no difference between "the warclaw livestream was cancelled without notice, I wish they had said something in advance" and "fucking cucks should lose their job, a multibillion dollar company should operate better than this pathetic, I hope the people in charge of the stream are laid off ". Being unhappy with something in the game becomes a license to abuse the devs while telling them you are unhappy.
---
The only way to make sure people do not do nasty things is making it impossible.
---
That means instances you can control.
---
Guild Halls should have a new upgrade to switch the ruleset of the map between PvE, PvP and WvW.
---
You buy the upgrade, talk with a new NPC, and choose between the other two modes.
---
Then the guild hall map reloads to an identical version with the new new skill rules.
---
Then people would be able to go to the guild hall arena to do their GvG. Maybe also add upgrades to expand the arena or add a larger one near it.
---

I did not take ppl to wing 6 lol.
---
As for the point about elitist pricks, I have talked with them. not all are but some are on a high horse. Obviously the ones that make guides and so on are not. I was referring to the ones that you find in game in the old 100-300 li range and in some "raiding" guilds.
---
Again, I was not referring to SC and DnT and others that made guides and tested things out. I know how much work goes into them.
---
Regarding your point on the fact that raids are to easy, yes they are for ppl that have been running them for a while the same as I consider all Challenge Modes dumb is if ppl just to their job. But that is just the perspective of a veteran player. I am amused when normal runs fail but when you go to lower li requirements still above 100, you will have that.
---
Anyway.. to me it seems you are under the impression that I advocate for easy raids and that is that. Hell no. I am advocating for a tier system that introduces 1 easier tier, keeps the current difficulty as normal and then adds 2 more difficulties above what we have right now. Even then that will not solve the issue as without a proper incentive ppl will just abandon.
---
The tier system should have been there from the begging when ppl were hyped about it. 
---
I for one stopped doing raids after getting 2 leggy armor sets and based on my small sample size ( 3 static raid groups) I was not the only one.
---
Lol thats awesome
---
yes more or less. Every skill has a pre and an aftercast in this case unrelenting assault is an evadeskill but in the end it doesnt evade anymore and the rev is trapped in the animation he cant dodge because the skill is still ongoing he could only cancel it with weaponswap but most of the time revs dont do that so they get hit.
---
u got the marker at first fail jump, marker stayed on u and u didnt dodge, result is obvious
---
Ha, YouTube comments are pretty damn vicious ... so true. 
---
No, I don’t play those types of games ... other than with my buddies once in a while. Never liked them much. I guess I posted a dumb thing. Real world etiquette and sportsmanship doesn’t really translate to modern online gaming. I expect too much from people. I just don’t like seeing people turned away from the game because people can’t stop being jerks. 
---
It's actually 6 stacks of stab, 1 initially and 1 more per target hit
---
     
---
I put dolyak signet in there so i wouldn't get 20 comments about how i didn't mention it, agreed completely on balanced stance. Stomp is just so satisfying to use though, and the immob break has gotten me out of sure death a few times where balanced stance wouldn't have.
---
You're correct on shake it off, I was confused by the wording as it's the same as every other aoe stunbreak @.@. I'm mainly taking it because it's 2 stun breaks instead of one and if you're caught away from the zerg it provides your only condi clear. When i was running balanced stance in its place i had problems dying to conditions or getting locked down hard in bombs
---
The great thing about axe is it fills your adrenaline up in 2-3 pulses of axe 5, or about .25s into its cast time. sword 2 into axe 4 into axe 5 uses up all 5s before hammer comes off CD and fully restores your adrenaline for the hammer combo, which means you can free up the utility slot used with break enchantments for a defensive CD instead. That in turn lets you run more zerker equipment =D  I like the hammer combo, but i try and avoid using hammer 5 if i can as it's single target with a long cast time.
---
The sword burst skill is kinda iffy in my book since its slow to cast and they may move out of range before the immob applies, even though the immob is great when it lands. I've been getting better results by just going straight for damage with axe 4/5 and downing the target instead. Though again, axe 5 is mainly for clearing downs quickly and chewing through any FBs that try to MI the dead. Good luck blocking all 15 hits with aegis lol
---
Remember apprx. 1 of every 3 map completion gets you a key, but a key is a key!
---
1, they should do absolutely nothing about this.
---
2, thanks for mentioning this place, i will make sure to have some fun with trolling :)
---
It must have depended on which EB games because the Wellington stores had 2k cards for years, but now they’ve said they aren’t stocking any anymore 😔
---
True. But other games did manage to hold my attention at the time. Which is my point. It took me 4-5 years to retry gw2 and like it (current version vs what was released). Mount system definitely helped in the process.
---
The thing is that he could say the same about you.
---
Explain [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/b3xjxa/arenanet_refuses_to_deal_with_players_who_have/ej2wlsb/) then. Open world meta is for everyone and they have the right to enjoy however they want by your words.

---
" You have no rights to exclude other players from the game, only because you want to do your personal thing. No matter if you have a guild or not."  
---
Are you sure about that? That's why you can lock squads? That's why you can kick players from squad/party? That's why you can lock x person out from your group in wvw in fractals in raids and anywhere else?
---
  
---
Why do we have to accept to be stalked and harrassed costantly by the same troll when we're in an area designed by them for guilds? 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Pathetic.

I play however i want! I'm gonna troll your roleplay in divinity's reach, enter all lfgs and merge them, join 9/10 lfg for raids just to remove it from lfg, i will enter any dungeon party and make npcs get stuck by not playing and blocking progression, i'll join a fractal and make people die on purpose.
---
I'm just playing however i want and you can't stop me no? /s
---
I agree with you. The arena is a place for everyone to fight in. 
---
The reason why we are reporting this player is because that is not what he is doing.
---
He plays a completely defensive warrior build and has no intention of fighting. All he is doing is run on top of the guild that is stealthed to give away their position. This is a big deal and forces us to reset the fight - wasting time to wait for cooldowns. 
---
He is aware of the situation as it has been explained to him in the past and it is clear from his behavior.
---
He does not have any personal gain from his actions. As we stop fighting as soon as he interferes, he is not part of any fight, does not score any kills or gain any other advantages. 
---
This is very much how I interpret griefing.
---
he was joking just for your info
---
Yes, it's quite normal to post phone pics instead of screenshots. 
---
No, good players use the screenshot button.
---
&gt; Like what?
---
Like what I wrote before?... I won't repeat myself, just scroll up. 
---
Anet should not take action against players for playing the gamemode. You guys dont own the place, even if you say you're in a secluded space and you have to choose to go there through a special portal, it's still an OPEN area for all players. 
---
You can liken it to a goddamn playground, just because you and your friends wanna make sandcastles in the sandbox doesnt mean you should scream and yell the second someone outside of your group comes into the sandbox to do their thing. Then there's the asshole kid who runs around ruining your castles and you have a reason to yell, but you shouldnt condemn every single person outside of your group as being the guy who does that.
---
In this case the guy has been stalking your guild for the last few months ruining fights, in which case he could (and should) get in trouble since it's targeted harassment.
---
Everyone who worked for 300% magic find was able to enjoy the benefits of it up until this patch. And they are still able to enjoy the benefits of opening holiday bags and better unidentified rarity drops. I believe the goal of this patch was to remove a noob trap that makes it statistically a poor choice to open unidentified items. Only after this trap is removed does it make sense for unidentified items to drop everywhere for everyone. Because the market price is always based off of those with 300% magic find and new players cannot reasonably get 300% magic find. 
---
Maybe because the devs themselves said that it was for us guilds? That's why it's in eotm and now a borderland? Maybe you should know something more before talking.
---
And yeah we can lock players out because last time that i checked trolling, griefing, harassment and bad behavior weren't allowed. Especially multiple ripetute offences since this has been going for a long time.
---
The person itself is PROUD TO BE 11 YEARS TROLL SINCE GW1.
---
FUCKING RIDICULOUS.
---
They will rise in price. Since MF doesn't affect opening them that means less Rare/Exotics you'll get so less ectos being obtained.
---
[The Dark Library.](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/399127144)
---
No, opening can give you something valuable, or just silk. Selling them is a guaranteed amount with no rng. 
---
Honestly, you are. GvGers aren't setting the ultimate rules, anet is. If the rules you guys made up don't allign with anets vision, it's time to find a different game. No matter how out of touch anets vision might be in your eyes.
---
Not the answer anybody wants to hear, not the best outcome for this game and its communities, just reality and the only ghing plsyers can do besides being angery on reddit.
---
The game isn't for you, move on.
---
The whirl evade is really the only thing GS brings to the table. GS2 is low, slow damage with a root. GS3 is great. GS4 and GS5 are both pretty useless. As you've pointed out both sw3 and axe4 are better damage than arcing slice, and neither of them use up your adrenaline. 
---
I honestly don't use flurry because it takes too long to cast, most of the time people move before it can immobilize them or it glitches and immobilizes them 300+ units away where i have to run to them to capitalize on it anyways. Much more efficient to just sw2, axe4, then axe5 to down them instead =D
---
How did griefers in open world get banned, but this is somehow a normal behavior?
---
Hey, you're violating the sacred rule of ERPers: What happens in DR, stays in DR.
---
Now you'll have to submit yourself to the Seraph's ass-paddle gauntlet as punishment for your sins.  Someone will PM you in game with a time and place.
---
So nothing gotcha
---
&gt; The Mistlock Sanctuary, on the other hand, is located in the Mists, so you can't waypoint out of it. 
---
That's a common misconception.  Mistlock is northeast of Southsun Cove on a layer above central Tyria.  The next time you're there, hit the map and look at the layer selection on the bottom-right side and select the middle layer (Tyria Surface).  You can teleport to any waypoint from there.
---
ERPers exist in every game, usually as a relatively small percentage of the community. Is it normal? It is for them. But they represent a small portion of the playerbase.
---
Are GvG fights still being done in the GvG arena in Obsidian Sanctum, or did they move back out to the WvW maps?
---
Dang. Thank you man. I didn’t expect to find much agreement. 
---
It’s difficult. There’s nothing wrong with casuals playing casually. The game is built for all types. I just wish the game didn’t lose its ESL/Harder Core players by the hundreds a few years ago. 
---
Another thing that has become difficult is that certain builds have very high skill floors or have removed counterplay in the equation. Ever hang out in the pit and get infuriated by the dead eyes finding joy in sniping people to death from stealth? Ever get mad because you were permanently stunned? Ever get mad because you used all your defensive mechanics but it didn’t make a difference versus a mirage (pre patch)? 
---
All this stuff bubbles up and makes it difficult to keep cool. 
---
It’s on each of us to avoid toxicity. I fail at it too much. I’ll keep working on it. 
---
out of curiosity
---
Did anet eventually say that 
---
"he eotm arena has been designed PURPOSELY for us to gvg."  
---
I only recently learned you could reorder the tasks in your achievement tracking panel. That was one of the best things ever.
---
Like what I said before. Choose another map if possible, or another time. It may sound very "defensive" for somebody, because "the whole guild have to adapt to a single person" and you can't do something "active against him", but that's what works in some cases. 
---
However, in a case where this person "chase" your guild, wait for you to join the arena only to hinder your fights, you should report him for trolling. If possible take several videos of him trolling and send it with the report. 
---
That's what worked for several trolls before. 
---
I dont see how griefing is Anet's vision. In fact, they made arena for that purpose and even updated it because targeted (gvg) community didnt like its initial size.
---
This is such an "arcdps will get you banned" level of comment.
---
So you can't read, gotcha.
---
&gt;  And higher mf will mean more/higher quality unids.
---
Except it won't. You need to go back and read it. Right now MF affects UNID twice: When it drops and when you open it. After the change MF will only affect it when it drops. When you open them its just the normal drop rates. Which means Rare/Exotics will drop less often thus making them rarer to get. Which is turns means this is a huge nerf to the value of the items we'll be getting from them.
---
The answers to your post all fail to understand that you merely interpreted the system anet set in place correctly and offered solutions within that system. Enjoy your responses, they will completely miss the point.
---
1. We're painfully aware after 6 years that this is ArenaNet's stance. We just want a bit of fairness when it comes to griefers. We shouldn't have to deal with that. Regardless of how you feel about the gamemode, someone actively trolling your experience shouldn't be ignored. 
---
2. Of course, but I'd rather write a polite post that outlines the problem with as much bias aside as possible so that the community, and potentially ArenaNet see and understand the issue.
---
3. It's Guild Wars 2's GvG. Guild Wars 1 GvG is referred to as Stronghold in Guild Wars 2. Games evolve, and so do meanings. Guild Wars 1 =/= Guild Wars 2.
---
4. Agreed.
---
I agree that perhaps this was a mistake on my part. However, any developer that actually looked into the scenario (instead of just ignoring it) would see where we were, and how we were not disrupting anyone else's gameplay.
---
the arena was created within the last 6 months. its not old content that they would have forgotten about. the arena was made for the purpose of guilds using it to gvg
---
i have reason to believe its when the spores are fired, not when he starts casting it and stops moving, not 100% sure. Sorry!
---
The game has been progressively focusing on new players, being as easy as it can, at what cost?
---
Maybe I'm over reacting, but in a game were a lack of vertical progressions causes enough struggles as it is, when it comes to rewards and their design, doesn't seem like a good move to yet again cuck the vets and people who actually give a damn. The game, instead of evolving, has been getting progressively easier on all fronts. 
---
Why the hell should we find another game if we have fun playing THIS game TOGETHER? 
---
Let me go gvg on fortnite it's just like gw2 the combat system...
---
It's not like GvG was a big thing in Guild Wars 1 4head
---
I quit GW2 a few months ago after over 22k hours of 99% WvW and PvP because GvG started to become less and less appealing do to a lack of support from Anet. 
---
It really wouldn't be too much to ask for a WvW balanced and organized GvG game mode or more support in general from Anet. WvW dies out, PvP high tier is long dead and most people I played in guilds with quit the game. All that is left really is PvE and it is sad to drop an entire part of your game like that. 
---
Hmm, alright 
---
The reply by the GM in the OP was as a response to the customer support ticket, which is also described in the post.
---
Would you be happy if they introduced what you are referring to as "GvG" but they referred to it as something else?
---
Get out. That's not a roadmap. Literally all it says is that they will continue to work on what they have been working on.
---
Okay, and now start thinking: How exactly should anybody here know about any of your reports? You will get the answer by yourself (I hope)...
---
Okay another time for you to start thinking: There is a person who say what you should do and you already do this. HOW does it helps to be condescending to this person in any way? Quick tip, because it's the 2nd question. It doesn't help. ;)
---
I think it's over a year old to be honest, but way less than half of the existence of eotm.
---
Here's the deal.. It wasn't a small portion before. Many of the big guilds have wanted an option for GvGs since years ago. These guilds were usually composed of vets and commanders that regularly lead and help give a reason for pugs to play in wvw by providing a tag.
---
But with the lack of support many of these vets and commanders are gone. 
---
&gt; but are also just wanting to play the game
---
So you're saying griefing is just wanting to play the game. Completely wrong.
---
Yeah, that's what the OP wrote to describe what he did and what he wrote in his support ticket where he asked to find a solution. 
---
Nothing about a report.
---
&gt; the zones you are abusing (yes, that's right ABUSING) are not built for isolated and controlled GvG. 
---
You clearly have no idea what area he's referring to, he explains in  his original message.
---
You won’t see HoT alive unless you go into LFG and join/start a meta group map. All four are still being done regularly. But if you just zone into a random HoT map you’ll most likely get the leftovers with a few players farming flax or messing about.
---
I mean, you're completely right. Doesn't change the fact that anet didn't see it fit to give you designated GvG areas with hardcoded rules that support what you want from the game, which is the basis for my comment (and not a dislike of GvG as a "thing2 some people fabricate here lul)-
---
Point is, doesn't matter what you say or think. Because anet implemented systems that go against what you wish for. You could attribute this to simply failing at doing their job correctly, or to a manifested vision for the game. Evidence in form of this GM response points to the second option. 
---
Soooooo.... you're fucked. The end.
---
Most of us were saying this years ago.
---
We are in a secluded spot specifically designed for organised fights. If you are unsure of this statement, then I can tell you that it was made and lated edited on the request of the GvG community. 
---
We aren't demanding that no one joins in. In fact when someone mistakenly joins, we explain to them what the gamemode is, link them the discord, and tell them how to get involved before asking them to stand on the sidelines to spectate.
---
No shit GvG isnt a focus of the game, 6 years of it not being a supported gamemode had kinda given that impresssion. That said however, this isnt about whether GvG is supported, its about players who are actively griefing our gameplay for months. They are only there for that reason, they aren't mistakenly in the wrong place, they just do it to frustrate us.
---
&gt; Perhaps find a different game?
---
Or I could point out that customer support is refusing to help a large number of players overcome an issue that is actively ruining their fun. We aren't demanding anything major from ArenaNet, merely that they prevent this kind of behaviour from ensuing which isnt unfair really, considering its fairly destructive, and benefits no one.
---
I agree. My post was concerning unranked. 
---
It’s a whole different thing in ranked and I’d be just as peeved as you and probably wouldn’t keep quiet either. 
---
Whaaaaaaaat
---
I just checked and that is *weird*
---
Yup totally, it’s really a shame.
---
I bought POF for the mounts, so what I did was use the boost on an alt to be able to do the raptor quest.
---
But if you can get somebody to help you do the quest with their lvl 80 character, much better, since you won't have to waste a boost. 
---
Said the person that doesn't know that the arena used (eotm) was built for US by a direct request to the devs (ben and Raymond) that hang out on twitch and discord.
---
Thats a huge strawman.
---
Wouldn't surprise me, but I thought it always existed when I found out about it. Still, took me playing through three SAB releases if it was introduced with Back to School.
---
No he couldn't, not with a straight face. Thats a completely fallacious argument.
---
And that's all you will get from them for the next few MONTHS.
---
Completely changing their roadmap and coming up with a new one takes time.
---
I would be happy if they gave us a functional instance or system and called it guild deathmatch or whatever they wanted. Currently, however, if two guilds want to fight each other they do so in a form what is called by most people that participate in or know of this activity "gvg". so in GW2, GvG means a 15v15 or 20v20 deathmatch.
---
What are you talking about? 
---
I said there are different options to handle with this guy and I wrote some of these options. If you can't read, it's not my problem?!..
---
&gt;Then what the fuck else are we supposed to use?
---
There *are* no guild exclusive arenas aside from the guild hall arena! If you want to have guild exclusive fights you have to accept that you can't. (you could with the guild arena, but we said it's no option.) Any other place for a fight is open to all players and you have to accept that. 
---
That **doesn't** mean that you have to accept trolls, ofc. If someone breaks the rules, you should report him.
---
The one [in the wiki](/r/guildwars2/wiki/newplayers#wiki_leveling) is kept up to date. The core Mesmer playstyle hasn’t changed any in a long time.
---
This has always annoyed me with its lack of title. People who soulbind the same leg get a title, this? Nada. 
---
Just gonna say thanks for you posts here, long time since I had such a good laugh because of someone elses stupidity.
---
Actually I did buddy.
---
&gt; It also fits in with their continued lack of action. In previous tickets we've made about these players, we have simply been given a response along the lines of 'we are investigating', with no action taken as these players are there the next day, the next week, the next month.
---
Mists Arena was made for GvGs, but your original report said WvW do maybe support is assuming you're on a BL?
---
It’s just part of the competitive landscape. People playing mind games, trying to get into each others’ heads, make them doubt themselves, hesitate, etc. Happens elsewhere like in some pro sports leagues too.
---
Yes I agree I missed that out in my message to them.
---
But the OP never mentioned any report. He posted a conversation where he asked the support for help to find a solution. That's kinda different from reporting players. 
---
It's like "*asking the police for help because you are not okay with what your neighbor does*" and "*Sewing your neighbor for doing xyz*".
---
I understand why you're upset, but just because a lot of people are doing something together doesn't mean that someone interrupting them should be punished by Anet.
---
This is like someone triggering a map event before the event train was there.
---
Or like RolePlayers complaining that people interrupted their conversations in the hub town.
---
It's unfortunate that ANet hasn't made a designated GvG game mode, but spamming them with reports isn't going to accomplish anything.
---
A costumer support ticket where OP asked for help to find a solution. That's not a report ticket.
---
Crystin Cox left Anet not too long ago, based on her primer about micro-transactions I wouldn't be surprised if she was setting a tone for communication. She makes some claims about player feedback that honestly left me surprised. You can read it [here!](https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1025345/Good-Design-Makes-Happy-Customers), page 84 is where she goes into her stance on collecting feedback. 
---
Continued obstructive gameplay over many months should be punished. It benefits no one.
---
Clear comment not understanding the situation
---
I think that it sux that the griefing happens but isn’t that like when a person tries to have a duel in wvw or make a meme or movie and just want the location? Things happen. Take it in stride. If I was making a star wars cosplay meme out there I’d have to delete a lot of footage of me getting ganked. It’s their game as much as yours.
---
Yeah as long as we can fight other people (guilds) in 15s or 20s without any pve element. 
---
Or a keybind like the novelties!
---
The way you report other players for something like grieving is done through support. There's q subcategory specifically for this and this is where the reports were sent. It doesn't ask for the player to be banned, since that's not up to us to decide. What was asked is to investigate and see what can be done. 
---
Or, like with your example you don't go to the police and tell that they should arrest your neighbor, but report that your neighbor is doing something malicious and you'd like it to be dealt with.
---
Knew the opinion would be unpopular, and that's not what I said. With a few toxic exceptions (which are the griefers) it's just people wanting to join in on the fun.
---
Just keep starting new tickets until you get a customer service rep who isn't useless. Dornsinger, at least from my experience can be really rude at times.
---
It's also worth just planting like 2 or 3 guys at the start to jump him if he walks through, even just put down a bunch of target painter traps.
---
So, I did read it again, you said “vg, deimos, and w6”, that’s taking a training to w6 mate. Reread what you said yourself. 
---
Dude, you LITERALLY lost SC when mentioning it, reread your own comments!!
---
You stopped after 2 armor sets? So only 450 li? Okay and?? Like, I really don’t know what you mean by this, I’m looking at 5 total armor sets right now, but that don’t mean shit. Hell, more vets know LI and KP don’t mean shit for a player. Most NA groups don’t have KP anymore. You seem like you’re talking about EU, which, as I said, really isn’t that hard to get it going. I did it.
---
Later mate, nice deleted account and backpedaling like hell.
---
??????????
---
That dress seems too similar to be explained by mere coincidence . . .
---
He's the lead GM, so its not like the stance will change.
---
All they'd really need to do, is to implement a password system... no password and you get the current arena, password and you get the arena where everybody else with the same password is. 
---
Well, credit where it's due then.
---
Still sad they needed to pay someone to write it for them, when half their fanbase has been screaming the same things at them since release.
---
Been suggested many times, I would love to have an option to return to classic Lion's Arch as well.
---
I wouldn't want a limited version of it, would be great to explore around the old city again. And most important, play the old jumping puzzle again as well:)
---
I find the sylvari a bit too human (faces, hair/ear-like structures, same hand/feets as humans). Florans, from Starbound, are a better plant-person concept (but they might to "monter"-ish for you).
---
If the gates are closed at the garrisons you can go around the left side of the building and into the bosses zone.
---
Just because the system works that way doesn't mean trolling and griefing is allowed?
---
Example of pve raids:
---
I link fake killproofs, i join as "dps" but I'm on nomad/minstrel, i run around with the boss aggro until everyone is dead and leaves because I'm too tanky to die.
---
I'm playing how i want or I'm griefing and should be banned?
---
I too read op.
---
TIL. I haven't don't wvw in forever and I never bothered with my servers TS because it was Maguuma.
---
Note that it works using wvw balance and using your wvw build.
---
Wow they really just keep shitting on anyone who farms in GW2. Honestly they have killed farming for me and that was the only thing i did in gw2 these days. 
---
They are playing the game according to the game rules coded by ArenaNet themselves.
---
You are improvising a a gameplay style in a part of the world where it is possible, through normal gameplay, for your improvisation to be disrupted.
---
The improvisation is cool, but the whining about other players doing what is intended by game design is utterly weak.
---
Grow up.
---
You can do it, first one is the hardest, after that you get the hang of it, I’m working on two at the moment and I’m almost done with it doing dailies and causally playing ^^
---
Do you have one on your mind?
---
Did that player cheat or hack to get there?
---
It always existed. Ppl used it in a lot of JPs in the first days.
---
You need to re-read what I said. Sanction Controlled and Isolated GvG is not a supported game mode in GW2. The Arena was not built for this purpose hence why its a 'Red=Dead' Free for All. If the Arena was built for this then Guilds would have access to tools to allow them to check out the Arena for their matches and the Arena would be 'Green' for all other players so they could not interfere. But, sadly, that is not the case. I also do not see that changing any time soon. 
---
Control shift H to remove ui for screenshots. Fashion wars meta.
---
If you want to think about it that way, yes...
---
Though the game wouldn't have known either, since it doesn't decide what an unid item is until you open it.
---
Not sure how that's related to the issue at hand, but no, everyone can get to the Edge of the Mists arena by taking the portal at spawn. There was no cheating/hacking involved in this.
---
"Secluded area" has no meaning in my mind. If the game allows plauers to go there then it's fair game. What you want is a SPvP atena where two teams are transported to without the possibility of anyone else entering.
---
I don't care if your improv game takes place in the PvE world or one of the WvWvW maps - it makes no difference.
---
The game rules enable PvP in that area you are playing in. The game allows any player to go there.
---
Fair game.
---
Start petitioning Anet to give you a proper gamemode instead of calling for player bans.
---
This is one of the greatest changes HoT has ever had, I'm so happy!
---
Specifically for charr.
---
Every 30 minutes it should switch between the old form and one of the transition forms. I loved rescuing people and the atmosphere of that version. 
---
We just stop fighting and kill him. Nothing is achieved.
---
Ben said in the comments that it works in wvw too
---
Last time I joined Jade Quarry discord I couldn't understand a word of Cloud Fly's Taiwanese accent.
---
You have your own perspective. It doesn't agree with mine, thats fine.
---
Don't insult someone and tell them to grow up because you hold a different perspective. That is very immature.
---
until an instanced area gets added there really isn't much anyone can do.
---
You have an interesting definition of 'playing the game as intended' but okay buddy you do you
---
I farm Silverwastes (and Istan while it was good) whenever I get bored of other content but still want to play the game. I really should learn to be a TP baron but I burned the bank crafting this and I have only 3g left so I'm in no place to figure it out right now
---
Playing the game as intended = doing things the programmers programmed the game to do.
---
Sure there is Anet could enforce their rules of conduct. What the troll was doing is clearly in breach of the rules.
---
I doubt the technology in an open instance allows that.
---
People playing sports in real life *usually* manage not to be complete assholes to each other. Things can get tense but people are usually pretty sporting. It's only when you add the fact that it's online that people suddenly start lashing out like children.
---
I thought they said they no longer had complete assets of old LA?
---
Your sarcastic remark is poor because you compare the game to physical goods, as opposed to services which are ongoing. 
---
Better comparisons would be products like:
---
Spotify - Has a suggestion system for new features.
---
Discord - Has a suggestion system for new features.
---
Netflix - Has a system to request new titles.
---
Literally every other game on the market.
---
Wow would you look at that.
---
I didn’t know that until just now!
---
1) Yes
---
2) large and mostly friendly, minor scatterings of toxicity as is expected in any online community
---
3) yes, metabattle, snowcrows, discretize are all good updated build sites
---
4) yes, 1 for each race and a centralized hub city for everyone. There's also a bank and auction house which sees tons of use
---
5) guilds are easy to get into. r/guildrecruitment is a good place to start. They're small private communities which share interests, and you get specific bonuses like a shared guild hall
---
6) yes, very much so. Endgame PvE content like fractals and raids ask for a full party of 5-10, but other than that, everything can be done duo. 
---
7) not all that difficult. You put an ad out on lfg and just wait, it generally only takes a few minutes max
---
8) not really. Each class has DPS builds, some have support builds, and some have tank builds. But if you're worried about over or undersaturation, you really don't have to ever worry
---
9) tank: this is hard because gw2 doesn't have a conventional aggro system. In raids, mesmers are tanks, but that's the only time that aggro is really utilized.
---
Healer: druid, firebrand, tempest, renegade/herald, scrapper are the big ones. Those are elite specializations of ranger, guardian, elementalist, revenant, and engineer
---
DPS: literally everyone
---
10) yes. Look up the gw2 world boss event timers for world bosses. There are currently 6 raids, which need the expansions to play, and ~20 fractals (end game 5-man dungeons) in 100 levels
---
11) mostly PvE, just PvP and WvW if you choose and for some achievements
---
12) depends on how much you rush it. You'll get plenty of play time in before you get to end game so I wouldn't worry too much
---
13) yes. General achievements and fractal, plus specific map dailies
---
14) with the second expansion, first chapter
---
15) some, but not a lot, arcdps is a dps tracker. There's also a radial mount menu that you can get
---
16) kind of. The dynamic events are more like quests, and the hearts are like a hub for interesting stuff to happen around
---
Been hoping when they rerelease season 1 (the dream) that attack/save lions arch is a big raid ending in the breachmaker. Something like the only F2P raid or something if season 1 isn’t tied to an expansion
---
I started a month ago with a friend.  I just bought both expansions mainly because I wanted the mount and glider systems.  It's a free game and I had loads of fun free.  And because there isn't monthly fee, I still feel like it's free.  I bought both expansions, one time for 36 bucks total.  This game has an unbelievably large amount of content for what in my mind , is effectively a 3y dollar title.
---
It's not re purposing. They were using the EotM arena, which was created for GvGs. The players griefing aren't even pretending to play the game as intended, no one in their right mind would even assume that they are. For instance, they will throw down shadow refuge right on the group as the round starts so that they all get revealed. They don't do it at any other point, don't try to attack the other team, just throw down SR right as the round starts. That is not playing the game as intended, that is griefing. Do you consider it griefing when players push the bomb back in the AB meta? 
---
We are not saying it is OK. Far from it, personally i think the guy doing this is an utter asshole but you can not expect ANET to provide support for an unsupported player made game mode that is played in an open world area.
---
In fact that person could say these 30+ people are not participating in WvW and are thus hurting their gameplay experience.
---
Do you know what gvg is? 
---
Did you read how he keeps coming back so quickly? 
---
Ah man, that's rough. GvG was one of the best parts of GW1 so it sucks that it's not really a thing in GW2.
---
ahh ok. thank you &lt;3
---
Let's never have the Tengu as a playable race because if Charr don't fit their armor, what good would having another animal race that don't have their own armor fit them properly.
---
I am so disappointed in this and in the way /u/Dornsinger replied. GvG is a draw. And has been absolutely spat upon by employees. 
---
Because it's real life.
---
Yu will never see a pro player act toxic be it on stage or streaming.
---
Yur trying to compare nobodies to big stage allstars.
---
Just go around yur neighbourhood and see if there is no kid who will get salty over a game of street soccer.
---
You take such joy in this. Why? People like you are shills. 
---
People run SW RIBA for mid level tier mats mostly.
---
&gt; MF already doesn't affect opening bags?
---
They mean opening Unidentified bags in SW with MF.
---
i can't get it to work at all. doing all the instructions carefully. then i reinstall it first, then arcdps. nope xd  
---
the client wasn't loading at all. 
---
Ah, must have missed that, thanks!
---
Not breaking any rules? Is there **no** line in the ToS to the effect of "intentionally harming the play experience of other players" or anything remotely similar?
---
Griefing is griefing.
---
To piggyback this, Thunderhead peaks is great for the griffon, it also has a little volatile magic gathering course as well.
---
"So i hear you stalk girls, I am ashamed of you" 
---
The white knight is strong in this one. 
---
Maybe a PvE/WvW switch to turn from one balance to the other in the guild hall. 
---
Or just... have it not be balanced for PvE when there is no PvE going on in the arena (unless I'm mistaken)
---
once upon a time the magic of special snowflakes came from being rare. now we have half a meter of snow, and not a single hexagonal flake is in sight.
---
It's because of the Snowflake update. They are no longer Pristine.

There's no such thing as a condi scourge in zerg fights =D

Did you mean [Colin Sohandsome]?(https://assets.tentonhammer.com/news/attached_images/000/017/509/medium/TTH.jpg?1468383404)
---
Actually the rule is that Blue always wins, and yur supposed to switch teams.
---
That's nice I guess, but can we PLEASE remove unids from the auto salvage table?? That's the only thing I really care about. I am SO TIRED of accidentally salvaging them! 
---
You absolutely deserve to get constantly  harassed since you've been doing that in game for months. Get off the internet. Nerd. 
---
Anet doesn't care about trolling.  They are more about being PC and worried about the feels of people in-game.  Drop a homophobic or racial slur gets you nearly an instant ban.  Troll for hours, weeks, months, or even years...its fine.  Sure, seeing a word in chat and issuing a ban might be quicker than investigating a hacker or toxic play but come on now, it doesn't take months to realize someone is being toxic.  Its also crazy to see how strict the forums are, yet nearly the complete opposite in-game.  The inconsistency is astounding.
---
Nothing like demoralizing your very own team and lose the game as a competitive edge.
---
Dude why do you give a fuck about people being ultra rich? You know this means less mats in general for everyone right? Talk about cutting off your nose to spite your face.
---
Put it this way, the reason why you're seeing it more in PvP is because ArenaNet has been genius in the way they design most of the rest of the game in a way such that it is either unnecessary or unrewarding to be nasty to others.
---
People often incorrectly attribute the general pleasant behavior of the community to the fact that we are the "nicest/friendliest/most generous community" in the MMO landscape without realizing the game is just built that way.
---
But people in general can be juvenile, vindictive and nasty when the situation allows it, and GW2 mostly doesn't allow/encourage that. However, the more difficult the PvE content, the more likely you are to encounter toxicity because the margin for error is lesser than; and the demand for performance is higher than; the general casual and forgiving nature of the game. My experience in Dungeons when it was still relevant is perhaps the biggest reason why I am completely not interested in Raids.
---
I hope you can take comfort in the fact that most areas of the game, players are generally disinclined to be toxic, enjoy those parts when you can, and push through the toxicity wherever you deem it worth the trouble.
---
Man, you really seem to hate how a group of players decide to play the game. So much so that you’re clapping for less mats for everyone. Cut off your fingers to spite your hand.
---
Imagine that 10 year old telling his team mate to uninstall life in front of his friends because he didn't score the goal.
---
sounds to me more and more that you are that greifer
---
With Balthazar dead, there is a gap in the pantheon.... all hail the box god!
---
Actually that sounds likely to happen.
---
Doing HoT map completion for a generation 2 legendary weapon.  I didn't think I'd ever have it in me to do another bit of map completion but as soon as I got all the mounts leveled, it was done in just a day.  Never again though.  I'll live without a legendary before I do that again.
---
Which is why I said it was some other daily room idk of.
---
I haven't even played GW2 in over two years.
---
I like your taste in legendaries, wish I had all of those...
---
That doesn't make sense..People will definitely stack these things and open a bunch at a time to salvage all.
---
This is the best advice for new wvws. I joined some random guilds wvw discord in wvw a couple weeks ago and they were playing music and talking shit and making Jokes until we met the other Zerg and then it was all business and it was the most fun I had in wvw ever. I forgot the name of the guild but I think it was in dark haven and it was fkn awesome 
---
We had to deal with this shit occasionally back in GvG's hayday.  Have you taken the WvWpill?  The   Guild wars 2 devs have never and will never give a single fuck about gvg / wvw players and even on a specific occasion actively fucked with the community.  Over the years we made countless posts asking for all sorts of small QOL changes but they fell of deaf ears.  GvGs in GW2 will ALWAYS be an uphill battle against idiots in the community ( who say its against the rules / whatever the fuck else excuse they come up with to complain about gvgers )  and the developers.   I once enjoyed the hell out of this game but eventually got fed up with this shit and moved on like the rest of the gvgers / pvpers with an ounce of self respect.  There are several MMOs on the horizon that cater to us as an audience.  All we can do in the meantime is pray that these games don't turn out to be absolute trash or shovelware.
---
Unless the primary source of your damage is power, it's condi.
---
The arrogance of wanting ArenaNet to prevent specific players (who have been at it for months) from constantly obstructing us?
---
yeah okay buddy nice one
---
troll is part of open world game play.
---
if u play any sandbox pvp game that's what always happen
---
this is pretty much what i said 6 years ago
---
if u stop zerging and cut down the member by half  u could easily use pvp custom maps and have an enjoyable life
---
People can be very weird.
---
You're asking people to stop obstructing you during a game mode that YOU have invented. It would be like if people were role playing in Divinity's Reach and using the emote system like they do, and some other people in DR were using emotes and they complained to Anet to have action taken against these people. Yes, they are disrupting their made up game mode. But there should be absolutely no recourse taken. You don't get to arbitrarily set rules at will and then have people punished when they aren't followed. You don't get to make those decisions. 
---
Actually, the deliberate actions of the griefer as described above does constitute griefing.  Jumping around someone like a ADD 2 year old doesn't impact what anyone else is doing.. This griefer's actions actually negatively impacts 30 other people's enjoyment of the game.  That's kinda the definition of griefing.
---
its a safety net, but it only works with attacks i believe, which means jumping from higher than 30ft in game will still kill you i think, but if it doesnt that would be news to me lol
---
We are in EotM. EotM uses the same map system as other PvE maps, in that it creates overflows. By GvGing in EotM, we are not taking spots away from anyone. Moreover, EotM is usually pretty empty outside of guilds coming to use it to GvG. 
---
Now with regards to your first question, the arena was made and later edited to be larger to cater to organised group fights. It is completely out of the way of any objectives, and requires entry through a special portal at each spawn. 
---
Because of this, I would say its the intention of this area to have organised fights. Now lots of different people will have different perspectives on this, and thats fine.
---
However, this player is being particularly obtrusive. We aren't looking for action to be taken on the random player that wanders in there to see whats going on, or the two thieves duelling in the corner, or literally anyone other than the 1-2 players whose sole intention of being there is, is to disrupt our fights. Malicious intent, that's the clear divide between these players and everyone else.
---
I don't think its unreasonable to ask for that truth be told, regardless of how you feel about GvG in particular, I'm sure you can agree that no one wants people who are deliberately acting like dicks to annoy you about.
---
Just work towards your legendary in steps. Gift of Mastery and specific gift for the weapon (both assuming you're going for a gen 1 legendary) first. Save money and mats along the way
---
EOTM is real WvW? Since when. Seriously every single response disagreeing with the OP is just completely wrong.
---
Never censor names of such people. People need to know who they are. They shouldnt be protected. 
---
Btw checking ap = Stalking?????  WUT.
---
Cool strawman, bro.
---

---
thanks for answering !

Ok deleting tge post so kids dont get mad
---
Yanno, I did get on my server's discord, but I was promptly told to leave for not having the mount yet. It was literally *six hours* after the patch had launched; I was 45 minutes of pip farming away from finishing the reward track  + the skirmish tickets as well. 
---
Like, shit dude, I didn't want to resort to it but I had to escort dolyaks until I finished getting the pips I needed. I just wanted to at least be contributing to the sieges and other players while I was present there, but that was apparently too much to ask from that commander. I even showed up as a zerg-buff spec to help. No dice.
---
That part of EoTM was planned for GvG.  There you go again talking about stuff you are completely ignorant about.  Not sure why there is such backlash against people who want to GvG on this reddit, it's weird.  
---
It's always on sale.  It's part of the Path of Fire deluxe upgrade, but it's exclusive to that pack.
---
No, fairly certain it guarantees you max out your jump length, you can't jump farther. To be fair, you'll jump your non-combat max whether in combat or not. It's a not-necessarily-intended interaction that falls under the "feature not bug" category. 
---
Have you tried axe/axe ranger? It's medium/short range but it's quite versatile regardless of Melle or range distance. I main ranger and I don't nessarily think lb is bad, lb is not my style but you really have to keep a huge distance to increase your damage overall.  
---
 
---
If you are talking about using a at least somewhat optimal build the only pure range build that I can think of is a Elementalist or Ranger.  
---
For Ranger,  specifically a Condition Ranger using double Short Bow.
---
Personally, I don't understand why they have to be projectiles in the first place.
---
Also, just from a design standpoint, I find it a very boring skill. All it does is apply 3 stacks of bleed. Would be nicer in PvP without being OP if it could cripple. 
---
That's the LOFT daily room, not Dellkat. And you can't swap teams by yourself if they're even, which they usually are- a mod has to swap you. 
---
i just wait for the day they bring back the beta events like the defeat branded players events, where certain players were branded and had to defeat non branded and aid players and branded commanders OR aid heroes like Eir and Garm. Events like that would be amazing but making it a meta would be fun too! if you died to branded you WERE branded. it was like red vs blue!

If you are at full Shroud you can still survive some oneshots from enemies. The final attack from the Jade maw will kill everybody without a crystal, but a Necro that uses his shroud to tank it will be left at around 1k HP.
---
I do think the Guardian elite that makes you invulnerable does block fall damage, but its very short so you cant use it for large heights.
---
Not defending Dornsinger's response, but this is pretty fallacious.
---
&gt;consistently obtuse ... supporting a game mode
---
The answer is in the same sentence. Supporting a game mode costs development resources. If it isn't a part of the business strategy the only support it will get is from a developer's own passion and time.
---
&gt;Even though it’s a small portion, their passion for this mode more than makes up for it
---
That's just not true.  Passion doesn't pay salaries and benefits, in fact in many cases it does the opposite. As in, a small number of passionate players do not particularly drive monetization (especially if the thing they are passionate about isn't particularly able to be monetized) even when actively supported, but their passion channeled negatively when they feel slighted can do serious damage to the rest of the game's acquisition, retention, and monetization conversion.
---
&gt;Most games, and products in general, would love to have such a passionate user base to build on.
---
Honestly, they'd probably happier if that portion of the audience just slowly disappeared. Passion for a product is great when it can be channeled towards promoting the businesses interests. There isn't much they can do with the GvG crowd. It's a made up 4th game mode with no obvious monetization opportunities.
---
Other people gave you good advice I think. Unrelenting assault is something you'll need to save some dodges for, or Dagger Storm if you have it slotted. If you have none, you can switch to bow (tip: sigil of energy is awesome here, gives you an extra dodge) and spam sb #3. As they said, landing an steal just in the aftercast will almost always work, and if you have Mug (you should) you'll get healed a bit. Dragon breath doesn't really have much of a tell but moving erratically might help a bit.
---
If you play s/d, sword #5+steal does a decent anount of damage and leaves you on stealth for a few seconds, and you'll get the stolen skill too, so try to use this combo if you want to be agressive while playing a bit safe.
---
Salvage all X was a godsend.
---
These are the type of changes that got us where we are: nothing here really rocks the boat. The difference is that instead of seeing this in a patch note, they are being mentioned a few days (months) in advance.
---
So, for those that are happy with what GW2 is, this is more of it. And for those that want something different because the state of GW2 is not satisfactory, this is not enough.
---
The recipe for upgrading any t5 trophy to t6 is:
---
-50 of the t5 trophy
---
-1 t6 trophy of same type
---
-6 Philosopher stones (I believe it is 6, or around this much)
---
-5 Crystalline Dust
---
I believe the minimum you're guaranteed is 5 or 6 of the t6 but can get anywhere up to 12. Much more profitable to do this than sell the t5
---
https://www.guildwars2.com/en/legal/guild-wars-2-rules-of-conduct/
---
The first rule of conduct is what it would fall under.
---
&gt;1. While playing Guild Wars 2, you must respect the rights of others and their rights to play and enjoy the Game. To this end, you may not defraud, harass, threaten, embarrass or cause distress and/or unwanted attention to other players. This includes posting insulting, offensive, or abusive comments about players, repeatedly sending unwanted messages, reporting players maliciously, attacking a player based on race, sexual orientation, religion, heritage, etc. Hate speech is not tolerated.
---
While it may be defensible behavior under scrutiny, a case could certainly be made that their behavior does not "respect the rights of others and their rights to play and enjoy the game." It could be called harassment and "causing distress and/or unwanted attention to other players." The fact that they are disrupting both the enemy *and* their own supposed teammates (the stealth disruption behavior), and that they too are not engaging the objectives of the map makes it pretty clear that they are not deriving enjoyment from following the "intended" use of the map, but rather,  intending to disrupt fellow players' ability to enjoy the game for personal amusement.
---
I didn't go into the video cause of bad mobile internet connection.
---
But if you truly wanna play a corruption scourge, you shouldn't be running soulreaping but run spite traitline instead
---
Do you have evidence of him repeatedly targeting your groups? I'd definitely point out how you are being harassed and show that Anet is enabling him.
---
Using skills and engaging in pvp behavior in a map built for pvp is only harassment in the most open of definitions, which I don’t think is the best route for a game like this to take.
---
As said, the solution here is having a closed off space available.
---
and the backpieces. thats how i did the achievement. i owned a twilight and bolt. build the 2 legy backs and then build sunrise and anozher twilight for twice told legend, this achievement and made eternity to sell it again. lost about 100g in that process but totally worth it
---
We still shouldn't support witch hunt, as OP could very well lie or tamper with the screenshots. It happened.
---
As for stalking, when you go to your friends and tell horrible things about someone, they tend to believe you blindlessly without fact checking ...
---
I had to go to eu to get my CMs done since in na no one seemed to be doing them. Lots more cm lfgs in eu. Transferred back to na since my normal play hours are their dead zone so I'd only be able to play on weekends.
---
1. check for this https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/4z0en8/weird_fps_drops_when_moving_the_mouse_in_gw2/
---
2. check what happens with ingame frame limiter set to 60, 30
---
3. check for CPU load % and temperature
---
4. try to set thread=4 in d912pxy config
---
5. update d912pxy if use old version
---
I love this one, I just wish it was less pink and more red.
---
Are you sure you're not returning gathering again before they respawn each day ?
---
I'd really like to do a Legendary for My thief, but i can't get used to the fact that i'm bashing My enemies with two fragile fiddlesticks. The legendary staffs really don't fit the melee theme for me. 
---
You mean 3rd Expansion? HoT +PoF are already here
---
I'd say ele, but I'm biased. It's quite difficult but you've got staff for total range, then sceptre for mid range, sword/dagger for melee. The good thing is, all of those are viable choices unlike some other classes (dragonhunter longbow is even worse than ranger longbow). 
---
You could also go necro, or guardian with scepter. There's also P/P thief or deadeye. 
---
That's interesting, i mean, no more drops without value [that may get a value this way], less exotics at the tp [seriously, we're overwhelmed, they range from 30s as armors to 1g as non staff\gs weapons] and a huge QoL for inventory management.
---
I like it! even if it may just be a cool way to nerf the actual incomings from many many things [various farms, tomb of primeval alt characters daily collection..]
---
So according to you harassing / stalking people ingame is fine as well?
---
Not really surprising...
---
ANET don't like GvGers because they are usually of a higher skill level than the average WvW pug. They are also usually the sort of players who create and suggest builds for WvW, provide fight orientated commanders and are "elitist" regarding group comps.
---
Without the GvG community, WvW would fairly quickly become a PvE style karma train where everyone can play and think they're useful and good at game.
---
ANET can't wait for the GvG scene to die so that WvW can become casual af like they intended. They can release horribly balanced maps and get praised instead of chastised.
---
I love WvW and GW2, but my god Anet make it hard to enjoy....
---
Thanks for the info. 
---
Hmmm you're right it does not impact someone else's activity, but that was just an example (not a good one) of what I was trying to say, which is that there is no rule which actually stops the person from doing so. 
---
Harassment is harassment. You can harass people in pvp just as easily as in pve. Did you miss the part where they were harassing their own teammates too? Their behavior indicates they are interested in deriving pleasure specifically in denying other players' fun. That is against the code of conduct.
---
The defense would be they didn't understand that they were disrupting other players, not "it's pvp, I do what I want!" It's the same as disrupting rp'ers in pve. At first glance you can't be actioned for goofing off in some random tavern where rp'ers gather, after all they don't own the space. That doesn't hold water when the behavior is repeated and/or escalates beyond deriving enjoyment from playing in the space into deriving enjoyment from bothering other players.
---
It's complicated because intention can't be assumed, but that doesn't mean that griefing other players is not against the code of conduct, no matter how many "technically it's legal" and "I'm just playing the game my way" a troll hides behind.
---
This was a bug report I made during the beta weekends...
---
Up you go
---
I haven't used a pvp daily room in months.  People get super bent out of shape and passive-aggressive so easily.  They get incredibly offended that someone would do things differently or fight w/ em.  People in this screenshot just wanted nothing to do with you period. 
---
Aww, hoping to get it solo.
---
Last time I checked GW2 had no GvG mode, therefore they have nothing to support.
---
what a dumb post... Its not an official game mode so of course anet is not gonna do anything with it.
---
just because you want to play the game one way doesn't mean other players can play it how they like.
---
I guess the problem with Wvw is once you enter anyone is entitled to kill you regardless of what you are doing. :(
---
get a signet of inspiration
---
Yikes dude, I thought your trolling with your first comment and I laughed but reading your further replies... you got some pent up hate against him lul
---
He's a good thief no doubt, but he's no sindrener for sure however  no  one just learning thief is going to jeopardise their experience learning from watching him like you make it seem to be.
---
Don't worry, the glow doesn't dye well and makes it hard to work them into your fashion. 
---
I could pay for mount lol
---
The communication is nice. However I have to say after 6 years of little to no communication with the occasional empty promise thrown in, its hard to not be at least partially skeptical.. Fingers crossed.
---
How do you deal with aiming your Bounding dodge? It seems to always take me too far past the enemy and not hit them at all. Is there some trick to it or is it just really unreliable on normal sized enemies?
---
The sword ambush attack is amazing, though. You're not required to use the axe it unlocks. 
---
* Join Discord

* good commander, but has to go.

&gt; almost feels right, but isn't quite there
---
gw2 in a nutshell
---
I'm gonna go enter pve raids as dps but with minstrel/nomad gear and fake killproofs, then bring the boss around everywhere to make the encounter fail until people leave the squad because I'm too tanky to die. The squad is open anyway, they were in lfg no? Just like the arena, if he's free to come piss us off because the arena is free I'm free to piss off raid squads because also that is free!
---
Oh wait, I'm interrupting pve! How dare! I'm just playing how the fuck i want!!! 
---
Except there are many spots you cannot get to otherwise, including to advance the story. Your logic is idiotic, if you remove gliding from HoT you can still get around just fine.
---
Lol true. These guys think they can own the gamemode and tell other players how to play. Gw2 motto has been and always will be “play how you want”.
---
Cute the arena is not built for guilds, that's why we have asked ben the arena and they made it? Totally for duelers!! Ahhahaha
---
[removed]
---
You dropped a lootbag and it repositioned you from the staircase to a more suitable area for the loot. Been doing this for years
---
That smug face, i love it so much.
---
I co-mod a chill daily room - Skyhammer, Red always wins, and we exchange shenanigans at B. If you're on at reset, look for Beast's room (I can't recall the exact name). If you're not on, then don't worry about it, 'cause we won't.
---
If you find a bug or think you found one, report it in the game.
---
Is there any kind of a roadmap for the game?
---
Do we know even if a third expansion is in the works at all?
---
In that case I cannot agree that the communication is good at all.
---
The lesser spinal shiver has a 30s internal cooldown, the f5 corrupt doesn't work on the shade but only around yourself and has small radius which means most likely you won't hut anyone whatsoever with it. The 10% extra dmg for 16s total is way too good compared to that. You will have way more value by using a correct scepter 3 than spite.
---
&gt; I let them win last match so I figured next match they'd let me win this match.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; I decided to bunker mid since they won last round anyway and figured now it was red team's turn to win. 
---
Admittedly, I'm still newish to this game, but... really? Isn't this kind of against the spirit of PvP? When I get to that point in the game, are people really going to expect me to let them win so they can get loot instead of earning their rewards?
---
Anyone can join but I can kick them. This makes it restricted access. In WvW you can't do the same, it's free acees open world pvp. And GvG is not part of WvW rules, it's made up community event.
---
I'm ashamed of you.
---
Sad trolling attempt, 0/10. 
---
Wth are daily rooms and why don't people just play pvp? it usually doesn't take more then two games to get your dailies anyway? You guys really know how to suck the fun out of gaming.
---
There are always two sides to the story, and I have a sneaking suspicion... 
---
you can kick and i can continue rejoing by doing /sqjoin yourname, just like us killing him everytime and coming back, i'm free to join your squad wether you like it or not because the raid is not full or locked. 
---
exactly just like he's coming back over and over after being killed, so if he can do it i'm allowed to grief your raid as well. 
---
I tried that on the minimap all the time and it didn't work, so I assumed it generally doesn't work... imagine my surprise when someone told me it *does* work on the world map.
---
I have to say that my own reaction is sympathetic to the case in question but not to the overall principle.
---
On the case in question, I have no time for any player who intentionally and without provocation goes out of their way to disrupt whatever other players  are trying to do. Unprovoked griefing ought to be stomped on whenever it occurs. And, yes, it seems quite probable that ANet saw "WvW" and misunderstood what you were saying.
---
On the more general principle, though, I equally have no time for any case where players (invartiably experienced ones) want to keep an entire particular part of the game to themselves, even temporarily - we all bought the game, we all have the right to play it, and to play it the way we want. If someone else wants to chooses to enter the Mists Arena and wants to take part - even if they have no idea about the game and are actively "not helping" - that's life. Suck it up.
---
Why’d you cover the names :(
---
Also worth to point out if you are a Norn, most weapons are bigger than on humans.
---
Is checking a random's ap something that only a troll would ever tend to do, and not something a normal person might do in the course of the game?
---
and you think that griefing 9 people like that is allowed? of course it isn't. so why is it allowed to piss off 30 people playing in an arena? it isn't either. both are griefing and both HAVE TO BE PUNISHED.
---
I can lock my squad so only a commander can send invites. I have all the power I need in my squad.
---
Found Sandor Clegane
---
You are literally ignoring what is being discussed to talk about GvG when the subject is clearly malicious behaviour. Next.
---
i can grief open world pve, just like that comment saying that a guild was griefing tarir by making it fail and they got banned, so why pve griefers get banned but this dude doesn't? both are open and both are purposely preventing others from playing. 
---
Failing an event on purpose is griefing because event completion is intented way of playing tarir. GvG is NOT INTENDED way of playing wvw.
---
nope because even if you put it "invite only" or "no" i can still do /sqjoin and enter it/get the invite showing removing you from lfg, making your group not able to get the 10th player for the raid. you're legit doing everything to miss the point and pretend everything is fine ahahahaah
---
You can't use malicious behaviour card when a player is playing a free access pvp mode, while community event called GvG is trying to restrict wvw rules. This is not griefing.
---
I can keep cancelling until you get bored. It's still intended because allows this.
---
and the arena instead is INTENDED FOR GUILDS TO FIGHT. THEY MADE IT FOR US WETHER YOU FUCKING LIKE IT OR NOT. THEY MADE IT ON OUR PERSONAL AND DIRECT REQUEST.
---
There are "daily rooms" with set rules (e.g. blue always wins, trade kills at a certain spot on the map) so that people who don't enjoy PvP can grab some quick dailies.
---
and i stop you from raiding for 2 hours until you get bored too and log off.
---
My favorite blind Guardian song
---
Never head for the gates, always go by water. Never missed the boss that way.
---
I can see you're going mad when you start realizing you are wrong. I can get it, anger is first stage of dealing with grief.
---
Arena is part of WvW, it's not seperate instance or game mode therefore all wvw rules apply.
---
Uhmm... stalking? I hope  she didn't tell him that exact word. That's the reason nobody take us seriously when stalking/etc REALLY happens to us girls.
---
i roam most of the time but the few times ive join discord it sometimes was cringy as fuck to listen to the occasional dark edgy jokes ppl spew out these days
---
or maybe im just old
---
That's okay, game allows it.
---
Or, more likely, you get bored after 15 minutes :)
---
i am wrong? i proved you being wrong so many times and you continue trying to be correct when instead it's malicious griefing on purpose and should be punished wether you fucking like it or not. 
---
ignorance is quite hard to get rid off since you cover your eyes from missing the point
---
Pretty sure this QoL change got put into the game recently
---
Dodging and jumping at the same time to be able to jump further horizontally.
---
Efficiency mainly
---
My point being, is it a type of grievous action you'd normally list as evidence that that someone is trolling?
---
Hey look, people being inconsiderate assholes. Color me surprised.
---
I have played Guild Wars 1 since release of prophecies and, as far as I have seen, it has never ever been described as Competitive RPG. I have only ever seen cooperative RPG. 
---
However I seriously dispute the games are called Guild Wars because the PvP modes exists (which are referred to as Guild Battles in game and not Guild Wars. The Wars were repetitive, clash after clash Guild Battles)
---
That would be like calling Final Fantasy, Turn based fighter. Or Sonic, Hedgehog jumper, it wouldn’t make sense.
---
While I understand your point that the lore exists because the mode exists, therefore the game is named after the mode, I must disagree in the strongest sense. 
---
Also they wouldn’t be called Prophecies or Factions without the storylines either. 
---
And certainly in Factions, story drives mechanics. Without the kurzicks and Luxons, JQ, FA and Alliance Battles wouldn’t exist. Alliances and Guild Alignment wouldn’t have happened either without the storyline being there.
---
Not in wvw. You can call people monkeys all day.
---
If people spam report you, regardless of what you said, you'll get banned.
---
If they don't you wont. Simple.
---
Is WvW about escaping fights or is it meant to be a place for fighting? :thinking:
---
People are under the assumption that just because you got the mount you will be able to run from all fights - wvw is a place meant for combat. Not a safe space for flipping objectives without resistance.
---
In other words; having mount isn’t there for the sake of being unkillable by escaping, it was meant as an adittion for wvw. (Which is get caught you’re forced to fight. Play smart and maybe you’ll be able to either escape or win. Same applies to the mount.)
---
At least you can pile up cobs for that:-)
---
Anet never fails to provide quality wvw content by showing how out of touch they are. 
---
i said this like 5 - 6 years ago when gvg became a thing.
---
anet obv not supporting this " zerg vs zerg "
---
if only they cut down their member to less than 10 for eachh side
---
they could use pvp custom maps ....
---
with all the functions needed for everything .. even streaming ..
---
but nah wvwer just like zerging 
---
Does it hurt to be retarded and not understand what griefing means?
---
No way to bypass it, like using another skill during the aftercast ?
---
Maybe some poeple find dialy rooms to be fun?
---
Or they want to go have fun somewhere elsde in the game so they use the daily room to finish their daily really quickly?
---
 I'm gonna go enter pve raids as dps but with minstrel/nomad gear and fake killproofs, then bring the boss around everywhere to make the encounter fail until people leave the squad because I'm too tanky to die. The squad is open anyway, they were in lfg no? Just like the arena, if he's free to come piss us off because the arena is free I'm free to piss off raid squads because also that is free!  Oh wait, I'm interrupting pve! How dare! I'm just playing how the fuck i want!!! 
---
Should just do this tbh. Just go maximum toxic, ditch guildraids and grief pve as much as you can. Record it. Make it an issue.
---
Anet has a history of fixing wvw issues once they leak into pve.
---
&gt; In a game that’s on shaky ground and has a questionable future
---
If you are talking about the layoffs, this was because ANet was spending a whole lot of their resources on other projects than GW2, the game is not on more shaky ground now than it has been before. In fact, if the intervention from NCsoft works as intended GW2 will now have a lot more dedicated developers than it have had for a long while.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
&gt; Stuff like this doesn’t fly in FFXIV ... Square shuts that shit right down because it isn’t good for the game. Of course it happens everywhere, like I said, but it will always been an area of contention for me. 
---
Well, not really. I have seen worse, way worse behavior in FFXIV. That includes but not limited to harassment, stalking, slandering and bullying. The harassment and stalking were on levels that would be considered illegal in most countries, square didn't do shit. It was so bad that the victim was advised to go to the police since square didn't do anything about it. I have seen healers being toxic, mostly towards tanks, after themselves fail at agro management. Some healers also refuses to heal you if you play specific jobs, even if you do a good job. Tanks that flame on the group for stealing aggro even though they were the ones to mess up. DPS that goes in and face tank mobs then flame healers and tank for dying. There is **a lot** of toxic behaviour in FFXIV and square doesn't do shit about it.
---
Meanwhile I have seen people getting bans in GW2 for bad behaviour.
---
That said, my best advice: Block, repport, move on. Remember that in GW2 a block is account wide, so it is several orders of magnitude more efficient to block someone in GW2 than in FFXIV as they can't just make a new character and work around the block. Also if you are going to play more pvp I highly recomend making a [Vial of Salt](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Vial_of_Salt) and ping it in chat when people starts being toxic as many times it will shut them up.
---
They are such a good person they even protect the people giving them shit.  
---
that's really hard to code, they haven't even made a proper instancing work since it takes more and is harder to get all of the people in the same hall than winning a gvg.
---
I would say learn to use movement and positioning to stay alive more. You shouldn't just run up to a mob stand still, and spam all your skills.
---
If a mob has an attack witha  build up animation run around it to attack from the back. If you are low on health and heal is on coooldown, use movement skills or run away for a few secs until it is back.
---
If you have soime utilities ot traits with protection then remember to use them as it reduces damage by quite a bit.
---
Also in HOT and POF it may be useful to take a stun break as an utility.
---
Eventually as you get better you will find open world too easy, even POF and HOT.
---
One side Im glad. I have hope that one day they will fix home instance. On the other side Im scared. Scared that guys on Wiki will not know what was updated, what should be writen on wiki for others.
---
They always know:-P
---
It's funny how you exactly describe what the interfering person is doing. People who gvg don't force anyone to play the gvg rules. They leave the border and go to OS or the eotm arena to meet with the people that want to play in the same way, without interfering the so called "true" wvw mode with capturing stuff.
---
The only persons not being ok with "play how you want" are the players interrupting gvgs. 
---
I don't think these people knew how daily rooms *actually* work. They we're probably like, we want the daily, let's go to this server that says daily in the title.
---
I'd recommend **not** going to Dolkats daily room. I've gone there a few times and it's in general been a shit show. No one has any idea what's going on at all. I don't think they even have a server message explaining, or at least they didn't when I went there. They also have the map rotating for some reason or another when Spirit Watch is generally the daily since the orb helps speed things up a tiny bit.
---
I understand you wanted to get your BL key quick, but I'd recommend going to LOFT's daily room instead (assuming you didn't go there first and no one joined). It's popular so more people use it and generally know how it works there, on top of that they also have a server message that explains things simply. Even if there isn't anyone in the server - join it, go blue team (winning team) wait a couple minutes and someone will pop up. If you don't see it on the server list, just type in the search "[LO" and it will display even if there's no people there.
---
I Love these kind of post, even if I might known all the tips sometimes, it makes me rethink my gameplay. Also, it's very rare for me to know all of these tips.
---
Awesome work. and to everyone else who might consider doing one of these. Just do it. 
---
You people are awesome 
---
(And if you never do these kind of posts, you're still awesome)
---
1. good point.
---
2. It looks like he is trying to get further insight as to why they are not understanding how things work. They weren't communicating and he appears to be a sympathetic nice person. He even covered up the derps names on his screen-shots.
---
3. true. they get a mob mentality trying to exert power that they usually don't have. 
---
4. agreed
---
https://imgur.com/a/Ei5Z1uM
---
I read the rules. Thx.
---
I just wanted to add the below. Of course, this is subjective but for me this method works best:
---
* Using 7 compactable bags from top to bottom. Im keeping these empty by default.
---
* Using 3 invisible bags in the **last** 3 bag slots. Im keeping fixed stuff here, like additional armor sets, weapons, trinkets, food, etc.
---
This way the loot starts to fill up the compactable bags starting at the top and those the stuff there doesnt interfere with the fixed stuff in the invis bags. When you are selling stuff to the merch, your fixed stuff doesnt even show up, so you wont sell accidentally any important items.
---
Great, great, GREAT QoL improvement!
---
Especially this:
---
**Core Tyria and the Heart of Maguuma regions will now drop Unidentified Gear rather than individual fine, masterwork, and rare items.** 
---
That's some sick loot from the BL key lol.
---
Ah yes. We crazy gays, and our cheesy builds.
---
One Black Lion Statuette closer to my home instance node!
---
too bad you can't fight the same guilds in os unless they're in the same matchup, and the troll is on the same server as the guild that was being harrassed (mine) so going there solves literally nothing whatsoever.
---
and it's not "people play wvw along you" we're in an arena fighting another guild, everyone is watching and respecting, expect the one malicious troll that continues to do the same day after day after week after month on purpose to piss everyone off. tell me that it's not harrassment.
---
lol take my upvote.
---
I had a hilarious situation the other night. Some DH complaining how enemy team is basically snowballing and we somehow got onto the topic of anet nerfing specific builds with the recent patch. All chill chat, very civil. Told him it's why I swapped to mara ammy and I'm doing fine on the hammer core guard build. Next game he's on the enemy team. I kill him a few times and hell unleashes; typical insults, telling me I'm trash. How I can't 1v1 (despite killing him twice fairly 1v1). Even went on to whisper me more salty orphan tears. It was some crazy bipolar if I've ever seen it.
---

Btw i dont give a fuck anymore, it took them way over a week to answer, no money from me.
---
What i hate most in the gaming industry is this horrible anticonsumer standard nowadays 
---
Ask yourself, if everyone thinks this way, won't the chances of it being fixed be even less? There is no downside to reporting a bug, ever.
---
unlike you, anet is the only authority to decide what's wrong and what's good in their game; gm made a statement, the rules were not broken
---
Actually I played the Lv 40 story yesterday and as I was looking at the world map (while in the Instance) I saw that old Lion‘s Arch is right below the new one. So either you are misinformed or they are lying their asses off. lol
---
It took over a week btw. 
---
We been telling them about this issue for years. And it is not a small issue that they should ignore as they have for so long, it can actaully determind the outcome of a fight as you get teleported to the spot were the enemy dies which is often enough inside of a bomb from both sides. If it is your comander having this bug being teleported away from his squad down to the bomb then yeah it does not end up well every time. And not to mention how fun it is to kill the enemy and he gets the last laugh because you get teleported from a spot were you should be down to the bomb and you die as well.
---
I can imagine that if a PvE boss unintentially kills players because they get teleported to lootbags from other mobs, this would been fixed fast enough, but as always this is WvW so we have to live with such game breaking bug for years and years.
---
No shit Sherlock we been reporting this game breaking bug for years and years and years and years. So then what?
---
To be honest there are plenty of players who wont move out when asked nicely. They just get killed a few times and move along, instead of dedicating hours to extensively griefing any group they can find.
---
&gt;**Eles** are an extremelly polar encounter....
---
From my personal experience, if the Ele does not fight back, I.E in a running situation, you should be able to deal a lot of damage and down them fast. 
---
However, 1v1ing, with the healing that Ele brings (**the classic s/d weaver**) has, it is very hard to kill with s/d thief at least. You can take a lot of damage from them if you don't dodge their multiple close proximity AoE skills especially since you are squishy. The general idea is to know what gap closers they have, dodge them/ kite them then burst, get out and repeat. Remember to save some escapes in case you get cc'd close as ele has quite a few of them. Interrupting their heals is difficult due to having heals on their evade, attunement switching and simply using skills that is the cherry on top. They are also able to get significant barrier from their dual skills so you could try wait for those to expire, just remember you cannot wait to long or they'll heal right up though :/. I'd suggest initially just baiting all their skills possible at the start of the fight before wasting your own burst.   
---
Source: Ele main who has vsed some thieves (Which I believe are pretty decent ones)
---
Magic find doesnt matter for mystic forge
---
I use the word all the time, but I fully agree with your use of the word.
---
yes but it affects the unid gear OP was identifying
---
You clearly haven't played WvW for a long while.
---
Which we done for years. Like i have probably reported it 50 times on my own. I have also mentioned it in numerous of posts here and official forum and that is just me. One person so now add all the other players in EU and NA who done the same. For years.
---
Not small either
---
[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Arthropoda\_(skin)](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Arthropoda_(skin))
---
So, just because it exists for years doesn't mean it should be reported?
---
I don't even want to know how many people found something and that "existed for years" and never reported it AND THEN complained that it never gets fixed. The devs can't test everything in any constellation in the game as well as we as players do.
---
You find a bug, you report it to them so that it eventually gets fixed.
---
Bug "reports" on Reddit are the worst place to let the devs know because they don't browse reddit 24/7, the threads get buried by other threads and other reasons. Only the most pressing bugs get the attention like exploits and other things because those things get upvoted and the exposure on the frontpage.
---
But does it really affect the lvl of the gear? Since only the lvl and type of weapon is relevant
---
Lornar's Pass just go to the top and fly so so far down the whole map.
---
No they're not affecting any warscore because it's in eotm.
---
there is no issue here. it's a pvp zone. you are in pvp. there is no such thing called gvg . so u cannot ask people to follow rules they are not supposed to know or care about.
---
deal with it
---
&gt; there are some cases where anet is wrong, but these are where actual facts are against anet, like unjustified bans based on bad detection tool last year, this is where anet was proven wrong
---
So anet is right except when they are wrong...... Facts in this case are pretty clear and the GM by his own words is wrong. This statement "What you are describing is not a breach of the rules. World vs World maps are open to all players to right against any opposing team player. While you may have made a choice to not actively participate in the core goals of WvW - fighting for your faction by fighting over Towers, Keeps and other objectives - this does not mean that other players are prohibited from doing so." is wrong
---
Every time I see something like this it makes me glad I quit
---
It has been reported hundreds of times by servers I was on alone. 
---
It has been reported by mail. It has been reported on the forums AND removed by the forum nazis because wvw bugs aren't allowed.
---
You want me to stop and spam bug report 5 times every time we wipe a zerg on a wall, near stairs or any other closed space? 
---
How does you going DONT POST THIS HERE PLEASE while offering no alternative other than STFU and dont mention it ever help anyone? 
---
At this point I can use it as a feature to port up walls when the enemy is bombing the top of the stairs. 
---
you are not agreeing with their interpretation of their own rules, which they are superior to do, that's not the same as them being wrong
---
New here and new to the game can someone explain this daily arena is this on a HOT map? (I’m interested in the BL keys) 
---
your are wrong. peolple are not supposed to know the rules that you made up yourselves. it's an open world pvp map. open to anyone and anyone can play like they want.
---
The point is Anet made an attempt and we don't want some bad aspects to detract from the many good ones. The point is to draw attention to the issue and not bemoan the neglect the mode has seen, we all know and accept that much. 
---
the rares that drop from unid gear are the awakened weapons. those are always lv80.  
---
more MF = more rares  
---
more rares = more rolls in the mystic forge
---
Is there any chance to get just the image file for those of us that can't/don't want to use animated wallpapers?
---
Because the dual monitor setup and the art itself is absolutely amazing! :)
---
LW3 maps do not give PoF + LW4 stats. That is why it is such a challenge to get harrier stats 
---
Be less of an idiot.
---
I'd like to see some comparisons at Shipwreck Peak, looking down on Tarir from the Northwatch entrance and looking at the base of the tall pillar in the bottom left of Istan.
---
With a particular emphasis on Istan, those are the most notable performance anomalies that come to mind.
---
That's better than a precursor, congrats.
---
He said it was yellow gear so at least rare was guaranteed
---
&gt; It is good that you contribute to that then.
---
Yes, because if we just post bug reports on reddit in threads that get buried then those bugs will not get fixed for all those years.
---
Don't get me wrong. I'm not arguing against bringing this to the attention but reddit is the wrong place for this. Support or the in game bug report is a better place.
---
Bug reports on reddit are a last resort. In game bug reports have been ignored for years. Mail bug reports too. Official forum threads removed by nazi mods.
---
How does you telling us not to post it here help anyone? MUM WVW IS STILL TRYING TO PLAY THE GAME. PLS MAKE IT STOP.
---
That's some solid advice, thanks!
---
Thanks! I was actually trying to get the grinning shield, but never expected to actually get it
---
Imo and i have accounts on both EU and NA and do fractals frequently on both. NA lfg-tool is a wasteland full of tumble weed. People say yeah but do them at reset because reset is a big thing in NA and were i might agree that the lfg-tool is somewhat better it still looks like our late night time in EU. 
---
EU have a lot more fractal groups. I am uncertain why this is the case because every time i add a group to the lfg-tool in NA it does not take very long to fill it up so maybe it is just EU players that are good at making groups or NA have less fractals players or more static groups. Either way if you pug a lot of fractals you will find enough groups to pug in EU for sure. 
---
As for ping i have no issues with that. I am around 175 in ping and have never heard any complaints. I guess if you are a oceanic players you might have more problem then that and in that case you hopefully get answers from someone who plays from that time zone. 
---
&gt; isn't this kind of against the spirit of PvP?
---
yes. it's also against the rules of PvP.
---
but for some reason it's tolerated by Anet.
---
So now they are working on Build Templates, right? :-)
---
Wow! Gambling gods were on your side.
---
I bet I personally reported it several times, and never posted it on reddit.
---
But seeing this teary attitude of dont post it here but use other channels that clearly do not work isn't constructive, it's annoying and only makes these issues get buried more. 
---
So please just do me a favour and stfu. Instead of posting this go report it yourself if you think that's the way to go. Takes 5- 10 minutes on eb. 
---
This kinda bs is why I call you an anet whiteknight. Trying your damn hardest to hide anything you dont wanna see, even if that means keeping it in the game longer.
---
The whole idea of a wintrading custom game server sounds stupid lol.

DH longbow 5 has a cooldown of FOURTY SECONDS while rooting you in place for 2.75 seconds. Also Trueshot roots you in place for 0.75 seconds every 4 seconds. Garbage weapon.
---
Yes, it's good to see some information, albeit debatable as to the ramifications of developer decisions. That speculation is *our* role.
---
B-b-but us GvGers requested it! Wait-- 
---
Did you just say it's not a private instance? 
---
What am I complaining for then???
---
Or they read it as i did as a person who like so many other players think WvW are whiners and want to shut us down instantly as soon as important topics like this comes up. 
---
Either way i read and understood your explanation but i still think you are not helping us by telling this will be burried since that is just like telling people to down vote. 
---
And ANet has several places where you can make suggestions as well. And same as with Spotify, you get no guarantees that your suggestion will be implemented.
---
In addition, you didn't make any suggestions. You posted demands and complaints, nothing else.
---
&gt; But seeing this teary attitude of dont post it here but use other channels that clearly do not work isn't constructive, it's annoying and only makes these issues get buried more.
---
But that is not what I said but only what you read from it.
---
I said, to report it ingame nothing more nothing less.
---
And no I won't "stfu" if you don't read what someone wrote and just base your accusations on your own impression or misunderstanding of the situation
---
&gt; This kinda bs is why I call you an anet whiteknight. Trying your damn hardest to hide anything you dont wanna see, even if that means keeping it in the game longer.
---
That doesn't even make any sense. I'm not hiding anything I just state the facts how reality works.
---
You make baseless accusations to this topic on something I haven't said or implied.
---
He just didn't want to spell Uwuwewewe Onyetenwewe Ugweuhem Osas
---
People doing dailies in arenas where they don't even have to play the game. Smh.
---
Yikes
---
Yes, there was this fun GvG fight video a couple of days ago. Posted right here on reddit. Two guilds fighting each other in the Arena with one clearly dominating.
---
After 3 or 4 fights, the dominating group went and started killing people randomly who were watching from the ranks above. Looked like a fun activity, but obviously, this Arena should be policed strictly. So better ban all of them.
---
even if you buy more mount skins that wont help, they will just keep making more mount skins and not actually fix the mode. the same thing happened in destiny. Bungie: "eververse will fund future free updates to the game" what actually happens *eververse funds more development of eververse items and eververse focused events where most of the rewards are stuck behind eververse* 
---
Honestly this is barely any different than normal. You guys just have an insanely warped perception from being on this sub all the time.
---
Looks like a decent golem design tbh.
---
really? i seem to remember several events that were ( and possibly still are ) bugged in PvE for a long time. off the top of my head there is one thing, not an event but a mini dungeon, that has been bugged for over a year, the one that you need to complete to craft nevermore.
---
I get that you need to play the Living World seasons in order (duh), but what about the expansion packs?  
---
Can I play HoT and PoF **without** having played the Living World Seasons?
---
Nothing other than fluff posts and occasional controversy gets upvoted, and the controversy gets like 60% upvotes showing a huge amount of downvotes still.
---
You guise under I am helping, but what was constructive in your post? Nothing.
---
And did you just admit you do rather bury these posts than see them because you dont find them interesting to see?
---
Gee really convincing me on how wrong I was before. 
---
Nope. Guild Wars 2 let's you make custom matches that you can set your own rules in. Some people make their own rooms just so they and others can do their PvP Dailies without having to take it into Ranked or  Unranked.

You might as well suggest him to go rob a bank or something
---
Trying to fix toxicity by simply being more toxic yourself will only get you banned and you really shouldn't suggest something that just screws up more peoples experience
---
You can believe what you want but that doesn't make it real.
---
You said it yourself that those posts get upvoted but what happens then with those bug reports just like this one here? It doesn't get upvoted or so little that it doesn't even get a number and stays at 0 as it does right now. Is that good? No of course not. But does this change the fact that it is how it is? Also no.
---
Also, again, I never stated what you thought I did. I added the comment to increase the chances for this to get resolved. Again, and I'm repeating myself here, when this gets fixed or why not is something we have no influence on. We can only report those things and as I said before and looking at all those threads before AND your own statement the hope that you post something on reddit, it stays at 0 upvotes AND gets seen by a dev is highly unlikely.
---
I also didn't say you are wrong but rather argue that my point wasn't wrong either, as you said yourself so fittingly that ...
---
&gt; Nothing other than fluff posts and occasional controversy gets upvoted
---
Oh that's for armor I guess? As soon as I knew it was linked to raids I wrote it off and mostly forgot it even existed. 
---
I started PoF and it begins making references to events I haven't played and characters I haven't met. 
---
I'm sorry I'm reading a thread with both gm dornsinger and a LOT of players stating everyone can do whatever they want regardless of how this impacts others, at least in terms of gameplay.
---
Admittingly, if these issues occur in pve it's a far less controversial issue and players do get banned. 
---
I think that's a double standard. I agree it's sad issues need to be blown up in order to get attention to them. Unfortunately that's reality of wvw, much more gvg due to players and anet not liking this minority playerbase.
---
Extra funny because they all claim everyone can play how they like, unless they dont play casually because then they play the wrong game.
---
The story as a whole goes: Personal &gt; Scarlet’s War Recap (go on youtube if you wanna watch the whole thing) &gt; LS2 &gt; HoT &gt; LS3 &gt; PoF &gt; LS4
---
So you can play the HoT/PoF maps just fine without having played the LW episodes, but if you decide to play the HoT/PoF *stories*, then you might miss out on some buildup or reasons why the main cast are doing what they’re doing
---
For example, LS2 gives context to why Scarlet did what she did, and that context plays into how you wind up in the Heart of Maguuma for HoT
---
An instanced arena is absolutely not hard to implement in any way. Literally everything they need to do it they have. It's choice not inability.

they wouldn't get a response, period. people have been asking for guild shit for years and what do anet do? dissolve the guild team. you have either been living under a rock for the past 7 years or you are like those people who hate wvw and just wish it would go die quietly on its own.

i have a 24-slot bag, soul bound to a character that doesn't have crafting level 500, is it possiable to un-bind it from that character without leveling crafting to 500?

Thank you!

Nah, women don't mansplain. They femplain about mansplaining.
---
I don't do PVP dailies but it's not hard to understand this.
---
Dailies are nice to get done. 10ap and two gold is great every day.
---
But they're kinda boring to do. And I've only got so much time to play in an evening. I'd rather raid or fractal or do HoT metas or pretty much anything else with that time.
---
I personally normally grab any adventure, jump puzzle, and gather/Vista viewer dailies. I really enjoy adventures/JPs, and the gather dailies take like a minute normally. When there's more annoying dailies that would take me longer (dungeon completer, bounty hunter, the event completers for a few examples) I'll hope there's something fast I can do in WvW like big spender or land claimer instead.
---
So far I've never had to spend much longer than 5-10 minutes on my dailies doing things I either enjoy or only take a minute or so.
---
PVP dailies are attractive for the same reason. If the tasks the dailies are asking you to do aren't anything you enjoy at all, but you want the very nice rewards, spending 5 minutes in a trading dailies room isn't a huge time investment and it's a guarantee you'll get what you need. If I did PVP dailies normal it might take me 4 games to finish them because I don't PVP, I suck at it, and I don't care to learn it. But if it was the best way for me to get dailies done quickly so I could return to the parts of the game I enjoy, I would do them. 
---
IT'S PVP. it's the whole point of the game mode. ganking is harrassment ?

IT'S PVP. it's the whole point of the game mode. ganking is harrassment ?
---
Seconding this, I tell people to eat shit all day.
---
I agree with you on this one but does this change the fact that you should report it in game? That is all what my initial statement said.
---
On reddit it will get buried because it doesn't get upvotes so it will be pure luck to get even seen by a dev. Reporting it in the forums could get moderated. But the Bug Report will most likely reach the devs as it is intended to.
---
"You don't play the game like me and enjoy it like I do. The way you enjoy the game is wrong."
---
This is how your comment reads. 
---
making a plan does not take nearly as much time as implementing the plan, people are asking for a *plan*, not an instant fix to all the games problems (although that would be nice). players want to be reassured and given an outline of what to expect in the next few years, the lack of a roadmap only gives credence to the idea that after season 5 it's maintenance mode. 
---
too bad this isn't ganking? did you even read the post? this dude has been chasing our guilds around maps, even to os and eotm expecially, came on twitch to insult, he even came to annoy me while i was doing pve raids. 
---
now tell me how is this allowed and not stalking harrassement thanks
---
Oh nice. I do recall them talking about it a while back and the cost of testing thoroughly. Though as they're making it global to the game, they may as well do it in WvW. This is pretty awesome
---
Considering the shield is big enough that your character looks like...[a walking shield](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Desert_King_Shield.jpg) I'd be inclined to agree.

Tp Barons have been playing this game long before Unidentified entered the game.

This'll do nothing to stop them =p
---
You are correct, it's only the PVE based (RAID) legendary armor that counts for the armor achievements. PVP and WVW legendary armor does not. 
---
Oh, I see. That makes a little less sense, but I suppose if the devs allow it, it must not bother them.
---
And pretty cheap on the TP. This was my hammer until I could get something fancy like the Stellar Orrery (which is also pretty large, while not being as comically large)    [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Marshal%27s\_Stellar\_Orrery](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Marshal%27s_Stellar_Orrery) 
---
My honest opinion is that the fact unidentified gear even exists to solve the 'too many blues and greens in my bags' problem is that this change just addresses a symptom, not a problem of gear ultimately not having much value*.
---
Their value only arises in sheer numbers, and the materials that they can potentially be salvaged into (and now runes), but the number of mats required to make anything valuable is a sign that we're inundated in a metric boatload of items of very little value.
---
I'd just rather they do away with unidentified gear and the rarity system and the deluge of items, but I guess that's not something that's possible at this stage of the game.
---

The GS ambush applies vulnerability by default, sword ambush is a pretty nice low cooldown cc. Fro trait the stunbreak is garbage now, use the one that causes all illusions to ambush when you do. Dueling and Illusions traits and voila.

Plans change as we've literally just seen happen.  New plans take a while to organise.
---
Most dev's are a cagey bunch these days, and simply don't release details until they're pretty much set in stone.  Just incase some expected feature doesn't make it.    You had your roadmap (infact 2, because Mike Z posted the EXACT same thing a few days later).
---
Until Anet's new plans are significantly advanced I'm pretty sure you won't hear a thing until at least after LW4E6 is live, if then.
---
Bleating about how there isn't a roadmap isn't going to magic one up out of nowhere.   That's simply not going to happen, regardless of how much you or I, want it to happen.
---
Good thing we have mounts now...
---
If you're here only to insult people, go away. This forum has rules, this subreddit has rules. So stop your shit and leave. Thanks.
---
Nah. It was probably used and I have some pets so I don't want to have them be exposed to that. That and if the police ever came to my house, we'd be in a shit ton of trouble.
---
&gt;It also fits in with their continued lack of action. In previous tickets we've made about these players, we have simply been given a response along the lines of 'we are investigating', with no action taken as these players are there the next day, the next week, the next month. 
---
With the recent substantial layoffs at Arenanet, I'm afraid the lack or responsiveness you're describing will get worse rather any better.

Some people just don't want to deal with doing their Dailies while in Ranked.

Also most Ranked players don't want PvE players joining Ranked just wanting to do their Dailies and not contributing to the actual Match.

Not mine but a pretty well known guild &amp; it's leadership didn't know about the Lunar Wolf. During a guild gathering I persuaded 2 other rangers to WH 5 with me to spawn it. This was in 2018 with people that have played for years &amp; never knew about the 3 Wolf Moon easter egg. Still gives me a giggle remembering how so many veteran players collectively lost their shit over a ghost pupper.

One of my first pvp experiences was similar in nature. Nobody went crazy on me, but there was a lot of mapchat yelling at me before anyone explained how the server worked. It put me off pvp for months.

the rares that drop from unid gear are ELONIAN weapons
---
Oh no
---
That's light armor. I got medium armor :/
---
And you deliberalty miss the point by ignoring the fact that he logs in only to troll and chase our guild around to piss us off.
---
PLAYING THE GAME AS INTENDED. HARASSMENT!
---
Yep. ArenaNet loves the casuals who just farm bullshit all day though while turning their brains off.
---
Every time they communicate it's the first time ever.
---
RIP
---
If it's bugged on medium it will be bugged on light. It was more of a suggestion to see how it looks like on sylvari.
---
And manspreading happens because we have our sexual organs between our legs. Sorry if we do actually need a little more room than women.
---
Did you know that the guild hall pvp arena have pve balance? This means that downed necro 1 with the lake doric bloodstone downed 5 attack, will instantly kill mostly players because it applies to every single tick of the necro! Let's not forget full damage from retaliation and confusion.
---
That is pretty lucky. Maybe take a trip to your local gas station and pick up a lotto ticket before the luck runs out 
---
Damage that kills you 
---
That *was* very thoughtful of them. It's such a relatively small aesthetic thing, but they actually thought about it beforehand and made sure to preserve the integrity, while it would be super easy for Aney to just.. not do it.
---
Must be why I also complimented him, right?
---
It's okay...I don't expect the average sheeple to comprehend everything I say.
---
This should be way easier if they just added a new entire map dedicated to gvg, and then let people who own the guild control its environment, instead of just patching up the mess in the guild hall. But if adding an UI to a breakbar for wvw mounts is longterm for them. I don't even want to imagine this instead.
---
no i'm not and the more your scream the more i understand him and approva what he is doing .
---
he is playing the game as intended : killing people in pvp while they think the can you a battleground as a playground. so funny . easy kill.
---
u are not understanding he is doing right. u should ask for a guild area where to fight other guilds, my god even a password protected eotm like many suggested (i do not agree this will close single player or small guilds out of the fifght)  but really u are just screaming with no reasoning . 
---
he is not doing harrassment. Deal with it.
---
by the way u are not answering. you are from guild  arma ?
---
Lets just totally revamp it every few months.
---
Seems like GvG teams need to provide security squads to protect their game mode and keep these griefers constantly dead.
---
Should I be putting all the gear I salvage in the forge?
---
what are those items you are forging?
---
&gt; No he didn't and it's just a waste of time further replying since he clearly doesn't get it.
---
Oh, you must be a very important guy, if you think you have the right to talk for me. Come from your high horse, Mr. Ego. 
---
&gt;I wonder if i join a raid on minster or nomad with fake killproofs and running around with the boss aggro until everyone leaves is "i play how i want" and not griefing.
---
You really don't get it, right? I don't know if it's extremly funny or extremly sad...
---
Raids are dedicated instances owned by the squad leader. The leader have all rights to kick you, if he see that you are bad, fake killproofs or even if he just don't like you. It's *his* instance and you have to follow his rules. 
---
To compare it with the situation of this post, the EOTM arena is **no** dedicated instance or area, it's **not** owned by any guild. The arena **is not yours**, no matter how big your guild is. *Nobody* have to follow *your* rules.
---
Like I said, I don't know if it's funny or sad (I think it's sad). You gave yourself the rights to answer in my name, saying I wouldn't "read the post" and "don't get it". But the actual case is, that **you** didn't read **my** posts. **You** didn't get what **I** said and got fcked up because of your missing ability of understanding. 
---
From begin you were only focused to go against anything that don't agree with OP's post and don't even hesitate to use insults and stuff to stop people from saying anything against OP's post. Maybe because of your ego, maybe because you think OP is the truth in person, Idk. But you never were open for any critism at OP's post. From begin you blocked anything and got agains it with aggression. 
---
Do you really think insults and aggression are a good way to support OP's message? Because from reading this thread, it looks like OP's guild is full of aggressive, toxic elitists who want every player to play like *they* want and if not they should leave the game. It's maybe not true, but you make it look exactly like this. Good job.
---
When does the server consider it a "new day"?  My expansion account validation said last night "1 more day", but this morning, it still said that.  When does 00:00 occur for the servers?
---
This is like the one time I asked someone to clarify their statement on the TwoChromasomes sub reddit.
---
When they drop from the BLC, they are account bound anyway. You didn't screw up.
---
&gt;	in vein
---
I refuse to believe that one was unintentional.
---
im so sry for your trouble but LMAO THAT WHITE KNIGHT ... you should reported them to support ! 
---
Thank you veeeeery much for this. I just checked and I do have this skin unlocked. I was about to freak out, but no point in doing that since it was account bound :)
---
Just pretend like "condi" isn't there and it's still true. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
&gt;lost their shit over a ghost pupper
---
NGL I get pretty pumped when I get 10 and can make another SSBSS.
---
There is a solution which is giving us a functioning guild hall (which currently doesn't work because instancing is broken and takes hours to get 30 people in the same map), or ban the 1 offender and be done with it.
---
That's why I use Darkspear. Only gripe is that the pointy end isn't downward on 5
---
I said report, not ticket.
---
However, so you wrote a ticket and because Anet didn't do what you wanted them to do you wrote another ticket and another one and another one and in the end you wrote that ticket you quoted here? 
---
And now you complain on reddit that they still don't act like *you* want them to, *even though* you wrote several tickets? Must be hard to not able to force you will onto others. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I too am hoping that thief gets Arsonist as an elite spec. 
---
God I hope they see this
---
Well i use all the scythes present in game. I was using the scythe staff, then the sunscythe and now i'm using the oblivion. Got the envoy too but oblivion reigns 
---
Need help with this one, as I know what, but not how.  My sister will normally ping a hello as soon as I get online, and I asked if she just always has the friend list up.  She says it appears in her chat, but she doesn't know how.  I don't seem to get these messages in chat though.  Anyone know how?
---
You're quite right that I haven't, nor do I have any intention of doing so. But nor do I agree with the idea that you should make people unwelcome by asking them to leave, simply because you're there. It's an attitude I've met in other parts of the game (WvW being a prime example), and it has no place in the (effectively) non-instanced portions of an MMO.
---
I appreciate that I'm not going to get agreement on this.
---
Normally anything that doesn't say "unidentified gear" on it you would open on a mid level (50)  for more profit.
---
Bin 'em.
---
I mained a ranger my first year of playing, but this feature took me a few weeks to figure out myself.  I remember talking to someone in map chat once about playing a ranger and giving recommendations and mentioning the swap pets in a fight feature.  Some ppl complained I should be using say chat (something i was still learning too) not map chat, then others spoke up and said keep going in map chat since they were also listening in and learning too.
---
I learned early on that you either have to figure things out yourself like you said, or be glad enough to have someone else give you pointers.   Who wants to read a wiki manual all the time,  lol.
---
Gotcha. Sorry I was just genuinely curious as a PvE scrub I'm not solid on all the details of how things go. 
---
Now that SAB is almost here, does anyone remember r/place hype about one year ago? Well, me and my girlfriend Lalapa just finished this long and frustrating project on [pxls.place](https://pxls.place) site, which is successor of r/place. On this page, you can place one pixel at the time, with about every 40 sec. You can have max 6 pixels at the time on your storage. This little picture took us weeks to complete with our lazy pace of work. Site has very nice and warm community and while damaging others art is possible, instead of that, some of the members helped us with the background of this picture.   
---
Most of these characters are designed by [https://twitter.com/wylgeartooth](https://twitter.com/wylgeartooth), who deserves thanks and admire. Pxls-site has 24 colors to use and I think we used every one of those in this project. Some of the characters experienced some changes during the process due limit of colors and space. We had to constantly change our plans and design as we placed pixels down. We also wanted to expand the group of characters so Lalapa designed Aurene and Quaggan characters (sry no Braham) and also she did the GW2 logo. And now all these commander tags represents all the players who also love this game as much us we do.  Have a great SAB season!    
---
Awesome fashionwars, awesome video, awesome explanation, keep up the good work !
---
imo 6 months is a long time in game stuff and A-net rarely looks back on created contend once released and bugfixed.
---
Thanks!
---
If you were to sell it over reddit you would get 19k for it. On tp with the fees its only 8.5kg profit. Just fyi if you ever drop one again. Gl
---
https://youtu.be/QjGk_jU6t5A?t=60
---
Just have the end of the map be the end of the water (waterfall into the mists abyss) and change the skybox to the mists as well. It'd be lovely.
---
At least it's gotten a lot better now. A lot better... Holy crap it used to be so, so bad back in 2012/13. When skills had no cap on the players it hit and anet said there were just too many calculations being done.. 
---
Deep knowledge of the game you have .
---
Every time this player has griefed us, we have made tickets about him.
---
Star Player, now that's a name I haven't heard for a while. Where'd yall go =(
---
Cd on mirage are pretty low and he got cds aswell so no matter how quick he can get to you if he tries without CDs he shouldn't be able to withstand seconds.
---
There is actually not one single demand in the post or in the tickets we sent.
---
In the post I pointed out that ArenaNet has refused to help us.
---
In the tickets I asked that they investigate the player.
---
Please read.
---
Nope. I got one last halloween and sold it for about 1150g. They are only account bound when they drop from a wardrobe unlock.
---
Ah. Crap, I was thinking wardrobe unlock.
---
You can try next time  if you're on eu :D 
---
[KRTA], a bottom feeder guild on NA.
---
Women manspread too because sometimes they also have a penis between their legs.
---
Changing map will also fix it. This mount bug is quite well known by now.
---
The Halloween skins (and a few others) were added to the level 80 rare output table.
---
Forge output isn't generated procedurally from all available items with some characteristic, the tables are built by hand, so they can put anything they want in there.
---
Actually in theory the change should be a lot better for newer players. If the veterans are getting less shiny stuff, then the value of the shiny stuff will increase. By removing the second instance of magic find, they are closing the gap between players with high and low magic find.
---
Your account magic find will still matter, so you have something to work toward. However, there will be less influence in magic find booster/SW chests/fireworks in the overall loot pool.
---
Fewer ectos for veteran players  &gt; value of ectos raise &gt; more profits on ectos salvaged by the average playerbase
---
So, uh what are these daily kill rooms? 
---
Right? I agree, you should stop. Just look at this thread.
---
Nothing, we just can’t hunt them.
---
They have a way of sending tickets even if you can't access your account, go to the support page.
---
uuh thanks for that!
---
Can one look into those tables somewhere?
---
I can't contact them since the person in question has my email.
---
I tried contacting outlook but I'm locked out for 24h. I'm completely fucked.
---
The shield is a special drop from any 4 weapons in the forge.
---
You mean like half the revenant abilities. UA is the same, Hammer 2 fails half the time on any slight terrain inconsistency.
---
They have been so utterly inept with class design and balancing that it's hard to get mad anymore. The class balance/development team is one of the worst in the industry.
---
And it's no mystery because they don't even have a public test realm and unlike heart of thorns didn't even have a proper beta test weekend 2x for each elite spec for feedback before release.
---
They just vomit whatever they feel like and we have to lap it up because whatever mess they make, they rarely change or revert.
---
None of the forge recipes are 'official' but there are descriptions on the wiki.  I don't know how detailed they'll get with the 'rare drops from forging rares' recipes though.
---
username checks out.
---
Uh, excuse me, calling a man's toxic masculinity "normal" is \~\*@*problematic@\*\~*
---
I wish I could give you my tp to friends. I'm sitting on near a hundred right now.
---
They know, they just don't care.
---
&gt; [basically, infusion stacking versus play interference]
---
I don't think these examples are compatible. People do get frustrated about infusion stacking and visual noise, but *that's* a place where I think the programmatic systems of the game are more at fault than player behaviour. The system allows for it, or handles it poorly, and people get obnoxious with that. I agree with you that obnoxious =/= rulebreaking.
---
However, someone going out of their way to intentionally disrupt a play behaviour in a way that requires both understanding *and* dislike of that behaviour - that's griefing 101 as I see it. It's a repeated, intentional baffling of player aims.
---
Yes, those player aims are not the primary intent of the gamemode design, but neither is infusion stacking. The difference in cases is that, with this GvG interference, it's repetitive and requires an understanding of just what most bothers the folks involved.
---
The line worth looking at is when naive interference, which this is not, becomes obstructive and intentional activity.
---
&gt; in my opinion the best solution would be a place where you can limit entry, or anet themselves giving us a place like pvp arenas where you can limit entry with passwords
---
This I think is the most-close-to-correct answer, and it's where I think people are pushing.
---
I think there's an understanding that just banning one or a handful of trolls isn't the long-term viable answer, so people are asking for a system to support GvGs, and using the trolls as more fuel for the community's need. Which hasn't worked yet, in the entire life of the game, unfortunately.
---
Works literally every time 
---
It should work on the minimap as well now
---
The item is masterwork but the actual recipe requires rares. With rares you also get the chance for a precursor so that makes more sense anyway.
---
When you created your email, or at a later point, did you add any reclaim options? If you did, you should be able to reset your password. If you didn't then you have to contact outlook cs.
---
As a new player, should I open all of my uniD gears? Sell them? 
---
Whale I hope they appreciate my donations.
---
This is new. I have never seen this before. (¬_¬)
---
You can send a support ticket anonymously and just put in as much info as you can about your account. I.e. account name, character names, guilds you’re in, any verification you had set up, if you have game serial codes throw those in. 
---
The more info you can give off the the bat the sooner they can recognize you as the true owner of the account and get everything squared away. 
---
Bro, that's 20 Black Lion Keys waiting for you.
---
The recipe is specific to these Halloween weapons. You also have a chance of getting one of those useless weapons that are normally bought with provisioner tokens 
---
I wasn't even aware that daily rooms were still a thing. I was under the impression that ANet changed dailies so that the rooms would no longer trigger some of them (in particular the game winner ones).
---
But if I stop replying then who will feed you, bridge dweller.
---
Some from PoF you can just sell and rebuy for the same price later.
---
Others you can obtain multiples just by interacting with them again in the open world
---
I got it bugged and went with zojja. Everything was dead and she told me good work.
---
Good old Zojja
---
&gt; Personally, I don't understand why they have to be projectiles in the first place.
---
Even more fun, this means they can interact with reflects.
---
The game's so projectile-hostile already that it's really worth this becoming just a non-projectile attack that has a neat animation, but that's likely too difficult to program.
---
Seems like it has gotten even worse lately
---
ah, so you are new to this game mode, welcome to LagWars with the BugWars expansion 1 and 2
---
Good, it's gonna take some time before they respond. Best of luck!
---
yey BugWars, reset will be hell 
---
This only applies for the very first set of Mount Adoption Licenses.
---
Single License - ~~400 Gems~~ 320 Gems
---
10-License bundle - ~~4,000 Gems~~ 2720 Gems
---
Sanctuary excludes a lot of skills that heal you
---
I would still disagree since Anet said that rare/exotic output (and therefore ecto output) will be higher from core and hot maps compared to the old system, so it remains to be seen, if ectos rise in value. And even if they do, its mostly newer players that have a need for ectos once they start gearing up their chars, not veterans, so newbies will have to pay more for their crafted gear.
---
PERVERT, DON'T TOUCH MY AP
---
Feels bad. I was hoping that a major source of direct healing wouldn't be ignored by sanctuary but I guess not :(
---
Many of those you can re-buy for a few karma.
---
So yeah, trash them.

---
what, how?
---
For a second i was excited for possibly a new map/world, but thats just a SAB choya as far as i see :/
---
I got this bug yesterday on my rev. It was neat to see the camera travel along with the character during phase smash.  I actually got out of it by clicking the dismount skill. 
---
Pure shit!! 50% or nothing
---
That was actually a player recommendation I remember seeing some time ago. Is this the turning of a new leaf for ArenaNet?
---
I've been waiting all month for mount sales, so here's to hoping desert racer gets discounted, or branded comes back. I might even be tempted to go for this one, but I only have enough for a 5-pack of the other collection, and this one only has a 10-pack. So I'm holding on to my gems for now.
---
Solid core of us from the [FUN]/[Ark](the 2.0 version) days are still playing together in KEK on FA. Some of the older guard aren't able to play as frequently but come to hang out whenever possible.
---
Hoping we get Purple SAB weps otherwise it's another year of me not doing SAB outside of dailies. 
---
Hold your gems, unless you're okay with 100% random skins. There's no "select" variant for this pack.
---
why would you willingly invest money in a dying game?
---
When you join your raids with scourge on matthias like wadup homies, and they're totally judging you but won't throw you out 'cause they know you got some black juju going on after that deimos last week.
---
At times I felt like I knew what I was doing while painting, and then I was like hahahahhaa no I'm just insane.
---
Pvp stronghold mode was probably Anet's wasted take on it. Could have so much potential using wvw rulesets and a open field or tower/keep reused asset with 15 player cap
---
surprise surprise, anet reusing old content instead of actually making new stuff with replay value
---
DH is what i say for the best and ez in slot cause, you have a toon of self sustain (bocks, blocks, blocks) MEGA HEAL (  [Litany of Wrath](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Litany_of_Wrath) ) stability, and a fair amount of cc, all that into a really ez rotation...
---
Wish they'd consider a going back and implementing a select license for this pack. I just cannot justify buying towards lootboxes any longer (and no, I don't buy BL chests nor keys).
---
wow, whole new tonic! the work they put in creating new content is astounding
---
Wants content with replay value, complains that content with replay value is being brought back. Sounds legit.
---
Bring back culling. /s
---
&gt; I only have enough for a 5-pack of the other collection, and this one only has a 10-pack.
---
I'm one of those who chooses a mini-pack over Select licenses anyway, but that's also my issue with this 10-pack - it's just too large.
---
Im happy for it. 
---
my god I haven't laughed that hard in a little bit.
---
Your PvP experience and the lay offs have no corrolation.
---
dungeons neither. You can faceroll any build in any dungeon.
---
Replay value doesn't matter when the content is only available for a few weeks
---
Love sab, but this trailer is pure garbage, as if they forgot to make a trailer and gave it to the intern that started on monday...

---
I prefer FMW to Dragon's Maw but it comes down to team comp. Note the 45% crit chance which becomes 100% with Retaliation and Fury bonuses active.
---
But literally no one wants to fight unless they outnumber you, so there is literally no fights!
---
Never stated if I agreed with you or not. So really it's again you jumping to conclusions.
---
The rune is *super* inconsistent due to the way skills are described.
---
A number of skills seem to differentiate between "healing" (triggers rune) and "regain health" (does not trigger rune) for some reason.
---
AH is not the only trait impacted by that, unfortunately.
---
Proof on this? I fail to see how "mass layoffs" could have no impact on PvP. Actually, it already has, in a much needed balance patch being delayed. 
---
And lol @ trying to use statistical words to sound smart, but phonetically misspelling them. It's correlation, my dude. 
---
I wish I could get grant money to study snowflakes. 
---
You can disagree but don't make false statements saying he's "objectively wrong" when he isn't. 
---
For this skill common animation cancels like dropping, stowing, etc won't work.
---
Krappacino
---
Sure it was part of the original scene but you didn't need to put up the picture of a news article. It doesn't seem like dark humor, it just feels tastelessly tacked on to an otherwise good reference.
---
I love the quaggans
---
If anything they should be working harder, not  slacking. Slacking does not draw new players in and they've had plenty of time to get back to business.
---
I didn't try to sound smart, I was just using a common word that I mispelled. 
---
I don't think you know what the word objectively means.
---
Here's an example of it used correctly: Content that is temporary goes away, making it objectively impossible to replay afterwards. 
---
a more accurate statement would be: "the only people that dismount to fight you, are the ones confident and/or stupid enough to fight you despite a handicap."
---
the warclaw in its current form encourages being passive as possible, because it brings such a huge advantage in extra health and mobility. this is problematic, because players should always able to force a fight without suffering huge penalties in a pvp gamemode.
---
It's not about catering to how we want the game to be played, it's about fixing the fundamental issues with class balance that they themselves acknowledge. They have repeatedly tried to Nerf scourge but go about it in the most headass ways possible. All that needs to be done is to make it so they can't 10 target with big shade, force them to share target cap between the player and shade, or just remove the player aoe. That single change would have fixed the biggest fundamental issue with scourge from the start. But instead we see patch after patch of changes to other aspects of the class that do nothing to fix that inherent issue and we end up in the current state of just stacking all your free slots with scourge. Sure you want a couple heralds and renegades, and the like 5 people that can play weaver properly will bring more value than scourge. But none of those classes you want to just throw mulitples of in every party.
---
The same thing happened with spell breaker for what like a year? They just refused to bring the class down enough until they eventually just nerfed bubble into the ground. The recent change to it I actually think is really smart(and I also asked for something similar to it ~9 months ago) because it keeps it as a strong skill but adds counterplay.
---
And let's not got started on how headass mounts have made the game currently. Adding 3 dodges, 12k health, and CC immunity to every class in the game(including giving scourge the ability to freely jump on top of you and start 10 targeting) is in no way shape or form healthy for the meta. This is the power and feature creep that has driven the meta to its current state.
---
Your right about every MMO complaining about balance, and I can't speak for every game but I think it's mostly due to a disconnect between the devs and top end players. They simply don't play the game enough in a high end environment to properly understand the main issues the game has. That coupled with all the mouth breathing inbreds on the official forums complaining about the complete wrong things means very few productive changes get made. One thing I will say is that recently Raymond has been putting in the effort to understand and fix some of the core issues with game design in WvW and I'll give all the props to him. Hearing some of the stuff he is working on makes me actually interested in playing the game more again. But unfortunately it doesn't seem like he has much input into the class balance aspect.
---
Also we have been playing with the rules the game gives to us, I've been playing with more or less the same core of people for the last 5 years  and in that time we have either created, or had some hand in shaping the meta of WvW. There will never be a perfect meta and people will always be looking for improvements and changes. The reason it comes across as complaining is because it takes anet so long to deal with these fundamental problems(or they just never deal with them and let the next xpac powercreep them to obscurity).
---
&gt;PvE'ers got the skill nerfed because they're bad at using it.
---
Disgustingly wrong there, the skill didn't actually get nerfed and the change just made it significantly smoother, the issue isn't consistent with what the skill did even when it had two button taps.
---
&gt;Hurt any use of it in PvP, such as being able to let it pass through as many people as possible on the fly before exploding
---
You can still do that, just like you can with phoenix, just adjust trajectory instead of timing the second tap.
---
Also, flamethrower on PvP LUL.
---
&gt;Now there's aftercast too.
---
That's the only thing stopping the skill from being an overall gain for the kit and engineer as a whole.
---
How can anyone take Guild Wars 2 seriously?
---
Your stupidity and my feelings have no corrolation.
---
They've effectivly removed the danger of running around in the borders. Geez that's good game design for a gamemode that boils down to player versus player and bigger fights
---
It's almost like people have different senses of humor. 
---
aww damn. I've been throwing rare shields for over a year now. probably spent close to 6k gold on them. but that skin never dropped for me.
---
Huge GZ on that!
---
You meant the exp needed to gain the next mastery? Stay at the desert, plenty of events all around to join and get exp.
---
I get into games of PvP against same PvP players who are better than me. They are causing distress and unwanted attention when they kill me.
---
You're treading dangerous ground when you try to police who can attack who in PvP areas.

This guy thinks he has worth in the world because he plays PvP?

Provoked or not, I had a laugh at this post lol 
---
Gonna be very frank with you, that girl is a huge piece of shit. To accuse you of stalking simply for accessing a menu which is readily available to you and then slandering your name amongst her guild, dick move. I would report her for spreading misinformation about you. Your reputation is important and you should always be on the look out for piece of shit like this who cry “I’m a girl and that’s a stalker”.
---
She needs to stop playing ASAP and check her privileges. What a cunt.
---
Wow! Imagine being so f*cking asshole you think you are extremely famous, but you are just an asshole. Report it to Support, OP
---
reminds me of how i used to be when i took games too seriously, feelsbadman :s
---
I’m starting to think that I’m part of the 1% of regulars on this sub. 
---
Most bosses you pack of trash will almost one-shot you (or one-burst you at least) so CC, clinds and burst is way more efficient in dungeons. And you mostly need to know how to burst (stack your modifiers and go all in) and it's really necessary to work on rotation, a good build is more than enough.
---
That is very lucky. I've gotten mine (personal goal) in 1500g worth of rare shields (i have however gotten like 10 The Chosen's so i made profit afterall;))
---
the mist arena was made specifically for GvG? I thought it was made for large fights. Anet hasn't made anything for gvg since they have no plans on support it  ( ͡°╭͜ʖ╮͡° ) 
---
Hopefully he was butt-hurt you beat his ass?
---
My experience is rarely like this though.  To be fair. I don't do a lot of PvP or WvW. 
---
Same. Some I keep in the bank tab like HoT books. There is a library in the refuge. 
---
I ain’t watching all that. Sum it up?
---
Looks great! 
---
...but what's SAB
---
that's completly different because you can stay in spawn or change map and they won't be there, unless of course, they're harassing and chasing you around on purpose.
---
this guy is doing it purposely just to be malicios and piss off people.
---
Report and be done with it, if you were the innocent in this. Any reference to 'Kill yourself' is, in most games, an instant permban, unless you were not innocent.
---
lol fair enough.
---
Some would say that’s the best part of the 16bit Pixel RPG generation, the sprites often act as Rorshach tests for how much we want to see nudity.  
---
Really first half is all you need.
---
he got his "revenge" on me after i killed him in the free arena
---
Wallet ready for shared slots.

Wait so you can gamble for it ? What do you put ? All green shields ?

Oh my sweet summer child..

You'll still get exotics, you'll still get junk and other salvageables.

If you google him, his Twitch channel appears. I read he is just 22. He has Youtube channel with 8 subs. lol
---
It starts on thursday and ends on thursday. It's been like this for two years already.
---
Don't think so. It starts on a Thursday, so it probably ends on a Thursday. It's a festival so it start and stop whenever it's programmed to. It doesn't require a patch (unless they're updating the start/stop dates, which they will probably load in this coming Tuesday).

Almost, yup.

Oh don't get me wrong I love SAB its unique in MMOs. My issue is 4 weeks for old content is a mistake. 2-3 weeks is better.

Objection!

Objectively, my objective opinion is that objective truth is objectively objective.

Objective.

You aren't filthy, you're beautiful. I'm about to head into wvw with an off meta FB build, hopefully nobody notices.

Just do some of the easier WvW dailies, like Camp Capturer/Land Claimer/Monuments/Caravans/Mist Guards/Big Spender. You need 80 pots for a full reward track and you'll get it quite quickly just doing Dailies. Usually doesn't take very long either to do them.
---
bet the support be like "WHO?"

talk of bags past 20 slot isn't exactly a "101" class.... it's fairly advanced.

also.... any 101 class needs to mention Halloween Pails, which are available year round.

There is a new update coming to eliminate all green and blue drops as a raw drop, instead we will get a container containing said drops as a stackable container. so hold onto them, youll have plenty of space coming soon

Well shit, we'd better not promote his name too heavily here then, might send in his flying monkeys to get us all banned soon.
---
At this point I'm actually using mystic kits on masterwork items for higher rune salvage chance ... I have so many mystic forge stones. Not recommended if you're not actively trying to burn through mystic forge stones. 
---
Sure, except most can't. The warclaw can simply triple dash out of range of any class in the game, and it is immune to all CC, so nothing can stop/slow it down.
---
And even if you managed to deal enough damage fast enough to dismount your target, you're at a major disadvantage because you've spent all your skills, while your target still has fresh cooldowns.
---
This is why so many suggestions currently revolve around some kind of simultaneous dismount skill, or adding a breakbar to the mount that immediately kills the mount once depleted.
---
That's mostly what I've been doing, although other than big spender, I know so little about WvW that the others in just like, "I don't even know what it wants me to do. I'll go fight a little bit and see if I get any of them."

If you activate Herald heal skill u won't be killed by jade maw's attack either,  also u can dodge it #randomfact

---
Does compacting sort items by type? I did not think that it does this and if it does not I don't understand how the suggestion is supposed to work.
---
Actually, it's much deeper than that if you will allow yourself to see it.  It's not just about fighting (though it is for some people).  It's not just about gaining points for your server (though it is for some people).  It's not about just finding challenging opponents in a relative fair setting (though it is for some people).  It's not just about using cleverly using your skills and abilities to avoid combat while playing and toying with others (though it is for some people).  It's not just about following a commander and doing everything they say (though it is for some people).
---
You can add on to that a lot more and it would be all true.    So to answer your question, WvW is about escaping fights AND a place for fighting AND much more -- though it may not be for you.
---
It'a also important to realize your point of view is not the only point of view.  You can accept others points of view without it being your own.  I can't stand zerging and it boggles my mind people like it, but I also realize that's just my view.  I'm sure many zergers would feel the same about my style of roaming.  Yet, I can accept zergers and am happy for them even if they're having fun.  And some zergers like to do the same for roamers.  We may affect each other and we do, but I find ways to adapt and I'd guess some zergers do the same with roamers.
---
You're also missing some of the points raised specifically.  In this case, what is being discussed is not "escaping" fights or a "a safe space for flipping objectives without resistance".  
---
Rather, it's about how mounts have altered greatly various playstyles since their introduction.  Some people (like zergers trying to return to their zerg fast after being killed) love the mount as it was introduced where it makes them much, much, harder to kill them.  The purpose of the mount in that format is not one you agree with but that is your opinion.  
---
Having the ability to dismount anyone you see with certainty seems to be a format that you do agree upon (there are some roamer styles --and others-- that would also agree with you on that so you are far from alone).  Yet the purpose of the mount in that format -- the one you see -- is not the one many, many others see for that is their opinion.
---
One can assume one is right and others are wrong and it's easy for many to do just that in WvW, business, ethics, and life in general.  But the truth is deeper.  
---
Often, if one allows themselves, they can see the viewpoint of others and appreciate it even if they themselves disagree with it.  That begins the process of true discussion and paves the road for compromise.  
---
As things were, when mounts were first introduced (excepting exploits), they drastically changed the landscape of encounters which some loved and some didn't.  The new proposed changes will make others love the changes while some don't.  
---
Believe it or not, there is room in the middle.  The word compromise has meaning.
---
"Play smart and maybe you’ll be able to either escape or win."  That and many other things about WvW were true before mounts.  But with the introduction of mounts, that all changes.  
---
In general, before mounts, I created a playstyle and builds that allow me to do what I find fun.  And I adapt with all various nerfs and buffs and modifications before mounts.  It is a rare moment for myself when encounters don't go the way I plan and when I don't get to decide when I fight and when I escape (as a rather simple example, for myself personally, I prefer escaping from a zerg while solo roaming as they descend upon me, while you may prefer to fight them and die).  
---
After mounts were introduced, I waited to let lots of people unlock them.  Then, even when I had my mount unlocked, I chose to stay on foot.  Why?  Because I like to explore angles and my options and to know the full extent of what I am facing as much as is possible.
---
I fought and encountered as a solo roamer on foot against both other solo roamers and group roamers on mount.  I experimented and test my builds and making adaptions to regain the advantage.  I found some rather powerful limitations due to the sheer power of the mount.  I also found it easy to easily nullify any advantage of a mount in that 1vs1 scenario.  When it came to escape, which I also highly tested), I found it far harder to escape a group on mounts while I was on foot.  I was able to with the help of a bit of stealth and being strategic, but it was far different and harder than before mounts.  It would actually cause me to actually just come away and sadly avoid some group encounters that I once enjoyed.
---
Then I tested using a mount myself against those with mounts.  I purposely teased countless encounters with solo roamers and groups of roamers.  I purposely avoided fighting as that wasn't what I was testing.  Rather, I wanted to see all the various tactics people were trying to employ to try to dismount me (I can be quite convincing to get people's attention when I desire).
---
The vast majority (solo or group) lacked the ability even when I stood still in front of three of them and then walked all around them as they tried various tactics.  
---
But I also meant the really good players who I was looking for.  I found several exceptional players able to fully dismount me with me running at full speed and using evades carefully.  And this on a one on encounter.  I did also a couple of groups who obviously their minds to create excellent tactics for dismounting and preventing escape.  I even met one solo thief who OUTRAN me using a combination of foot and mount to allow himself the leisure of time to dismount and battle.
---
So...one could simply say, no changes are necessary.  No dismount traps or skills are needed.  Solo players CAN dismount if you can simply play smart.  But, in reality, it drastically changes the environment and puts the odds heavily in favor of the defender and person who wants to escape.  Playing smart works but it changes the landscape in a way that is simply unfair.
---
The reverse, though, you see is also true when you allow full dismounting.  Yes, I'm aware I could use it to my personal advantage as a roamer a great deal but it's important to look at all the scenarios (some of which are negative) and to look at the perspective of others as well.
---
While I roam solo the majority of the time, I do have friends I roam with also.  And I can tell you this.  
---
Scenario A:  If you (BEFORE MOUNTS) as a highly skilled solo roamer came into my territory to flip a camp, you'd have a fair chance of escaping from both myself and two of my friends as we actively attacked you.  You would have to be really highly skilled to escape and actually make it out because we're also set with speed, anti-stealth, and specific group tactics -- but if you're skilled enough, you still have a fair chance.
---
Scenario B:  After mounts and before dismount traps and skills.  Same situation with camp.  Your chances of escape are higher but in no way guaranteed.  As a highly skilled roamer you'd see us coming while engaged on foot with NPCs or would see our trap even before engaging if we chose to lay one.  Either way, you'd find a way to skillfully disengage from combat and mount up before we reached you.  Your odds of escaping from us is far from guaranteed because we are faster on mounts in our own territory.  If we're build to dismount you by sheer damage (and we would be), odds are you won't make it and you will be dismounted while one of us continues to stay on the mount to prevent traditional escapes.  But, in reality, the % chance of you escaping is higher.  It favors you and alters things before mounts in your favor.  How much depends on who you encounter.  Against us, very little.  Against the majority of people with their current skill levels for dismounting (people are still learning), your chance increases greatly.
---
Scenario C:  Mounts with full dismount rules like traps and skills in addition to previous methods.  Camp situation once again.   Your odds of escape have dramatically decreased compared to BOTH scenario B AND scenario A (before mounts).  In this scenario (scenario C), you WILL be dismounted.  If someone how you avoid the traps, you can bet we will dismount you with our ranged dismount skills.  Then you will encounter one to two of us on foot while at least on person stays on mount preventing your escape.  Playing smart, can you still survive and escape?  Sure!  But compared to scenario A (before mounts), the odds of it are extremely small.  In Scenario A, with all 3 of us against you, if you are skilled, you still have a fair chance of getting out of their alive (and trying to turn the tables against us).  In scenario C, your odds of doing that are not nil, but not far from it.  
---
Just like scenario B alters things dramatically for the standard WvW player who is still figuring out how to dismount via damage in favor of the defender, scenario C alters things dramatically in favor of the attackers.
---
I propose that both scenario B and C alter things too much from scenario A (WvW as it has been all these years before mounts).  I propose finding somewhere in between B and C.  
---
Everything is not black and white.
---
Idk I know a lot of people adore this but I’ve always seen it as a separate part of the game that doesn’t use anything interesting of the game Anet built.
---
That did it.. thanks so much!
---
This hasn't been my experience in the least.
---
But I guess the experience can vary a lot between different the game regions, the different tiers, and of course the time at which you play. 
---
While I'm doing my scout/roam supply line rounds in EU T1 at late hours after reset, I'm actually seeing more people trying to engage solo, mount or not. Before mounts what I usually saw was couples with synergized duo builds picking off solo players or small inexperienced groups of 2-4 players they noticed were trying to do dailies or getting a few pips, and those who were actually solo had rather niche ganking builds and would run away as soon as they were a bit outnumbered. 
---
I think that now that people can run back faster after defeat, they are more willing to risk fights, when they are close to base. Sometimes running back to the south sentry from citadel on foot can feel like a drag. 
---
Hell, if a five year old managed to cohesively string together that many profanities then color me impressed. I wouldn’t even be mad. — Either way, I guess I got an idea of what to expect now so I won’t let it irk me. Thanks. 
---
Throwing in a couple of Quaggans instead of Braham...
---
I approve.
---
Even nicer would be if certain servers would actually use Discord instead of sticking with Teamspeak. It's getting frustrating to keep it installed for the select few guilds that still use it when Discord is so much easier to use and moderate.
---
That behavior can be reported. 
---
I believe there's a no tolerance policy with that kind of "kill yourself" talk. 
---
You are correct, the exp bar while training any masteries is your mastery experience bar. Once that's filled, you can unlock the mastery you've been training.
---
The amount of experience needed though is determined by the track you're training.
---
See [here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Central_Tyria_mastery_tracks#Pact_Commander) for all the central tyria (core) masteries and how much exp they need
---
I know the intrigue to figure out how we could troll the troll is very tempting but I am sure with the way balance is and a custom build to troll with might make that hard. 
---
Steal /u/RubberPuppet 's idea. Set aside a dedicated few players to kill the guy as he comes in. It'll work.
---
At first.
---
But then, he escalates. And he starts bringing a couple of *his* buddies to fight the gank-patrol.
---
So you set aside a full party to stop them. And it quells the rebellion.
---
For now.
---
But now the rebels are angry, their pilgrimage of parade-pissing will not be stopped! They bring a **PARTY** to push their perverse justice! 
---
Before long, you'll keep ramming heads in a constant arms race for arena supremacy. Lines will be drawn. Factions will form. Bonds will be broken, friendships forged. Months from now, when the leaders of the war-bands don't even remember why they fight, only that they must, you'll pause a moment, and realize you have achieved *true* GvG.

I made a separate comment with the true endgame for this line of thinking. I tried to ping you in it, idk if it worked.

Even if Josh hadn't been laid off, I don't know if we ever would have seen another world.

  People may either not know, or forgot the situation that popped up on the forums when World 2 was added.  The forum posts are gone now as this was back in 2013, but there is a couple [blog posts](http://joshuaforeman.blogspot.com/2013/09/dealing-with-criticism.html) from him about it. 
---
 I recall seeing somewhere after this, that he said his heart wasn't really into working on SAB after that. Things change of course, but without another world being done in 6 years, I guess maybe he never got back into it.
---
When you buy large amounts they’re more consistent due to statuettes, but still nothing to gamble on. 
---
If you’re looking to spend money to support the game they’re not bad. Basically I’ll buy keys when they’re on sale if there’s nothing else in the shop recently introduced I would want.

&gt; Your fanboy-ism is showing very clearly. Calm down and breathe.

I just completed the achievement for the Aurene plushy. &gt;!The one part it says you have to show it to her. Luckily we go back in time for that part or I would be too late.!&lt;
---
I certainly hope so - as much as an early May release would make for a lovely birthday present, it would also be a full four months after the most recent episode. Mid-to-late April is already pushing it in my book, and ANet really needs to prove that they can actually get content out at a reasonable pace right now.
---
Sounds like you were causing needless trouble for yourself.  You should know a little about the daily rooms you join.
---
You say you were in Dollkats's den (fyi dollkats legacy works the same way)
---
Dollkats has a bot of sorts (named something like just shoot me), it runs out (if it doesnt get stuck on things) so you can kill it for top stats/kills with out needing another player. Kill it all you want, it wont care. The (usually) 'unspoken'rule is whatever team the bot is NOT on wins. It doesnt come up a lot as 90% of the time this room is just you and the bot and the bot cant win. 
---
The other 10% of the time, you joined while someone was expecting to quietly farm the bot for their daily quests with out being bothered.  Some people offer to trade kills/caps, but most people just swap to the non-bot side to avoid conflict.  
---
As soon as you bunker up on a point or outside the enemy spawn while you are on the bots team you are going to run into a lot of problems with players that do not natively speak english, are underage, who are just derpy or want to be left alone.
---
Maybe its a weird daily room, but its easy to follow the rooms rules of be nice and have fun.

My experience has been the same as the guy in the video where he attacked the thiefs mount and 3 leaps away never to be seen again making running around and playing literally pointless/unplayable.

Oh, i also had 1 different experience, engie ran in circles on a camp, i couldn't catch him but mount can contest camps for no kitten reason, then 2 mins later 2 of his friends came.

I farmed the king toad set a while back, started making progress on the storm wizard set and then missed the next few SABs because I've been busy each time. If it means I can finish what I started long ago without the pain of relearning world 2 then sign me up.

This list is tragically still tiny for charr.

Charr wielding shortbows look like silly Cupids, and I always imagine the autoattacks going \*twang\*
---
Very recent layoffs have nothing to do with a game mode thats been in the shitter since pvp season 5. A recent change in the company cant retroactively impact the quality of content they abandoned years ago after realizing gw2 had zero esport potential.

The video was funny, but based on the comment section here youre a real ass and r/iamverysmart meterial at the same time. Jesus. Jumping on an intellectual high horse over a misspelling.

Well we like our Zojja bald
---
Roaming has not been removed, and the development of the warclaw is not over.   
---
Several things about the warclaw are going to change, and they can still change further in the future.   
---
Complaining about the warclaw existing and demanding it to be removed or made useless is a waste of time, as we all know it is never going to be removed or turned into a niche thing people can only use to run in their own territories after getting all the positive feedback and metrics they are getting about it.  
---
So it's better to be productive and focus on how to improve it.  
---
For example, if people can run away too easily, maybe we should be able to use skill 3 also on enemy mounts to tether them, like a "lasso" or "harpoon". Then the skill 3 would flip over to another skill with a 1s cooldown to repeatedly "reel" or "pull" them, that would damage the mount and slow it down, so the more it's used the slower it gets. Let at least 3 mounts stack their lassos on another mount to slow it down to a halt faster.   
---
Maybe the mounts should also get a defiance bar when they are tethered by another mount, so they can be dismounted with the help of ally CC and other mounts also harpooning them.      
---
Maybe they should have way less health while they are running on enemy territory to make them riskier to use there. Low enough that the bleeding of 1 or 2 warclaws would dismount you.    
---
In my experience there is no difference in actual lag, but probably some people are experiencing even lower FPS, which might be mistaken for lag. Skill lag is totally server-side issue, where the server cannot calculate and propagate all the user actions in time, where FPS problems are purely client side.
---
Holosmith, Daredevil/Deadeye, Condi Mirage.

tp?
---
useless hater video.  they are already working on the warclaw things , very actively.   and the scout thing.... simply stay away from flags not that hard lol
---
they did say there will most likely be some delays going forward due to "what happened" so I guess it all depends on how much of ep6 was done before it happened..
---
This topic is about players who have disrupted GvGs for months - if you want to start a new topic about the problems with the GvG areas which have been provided, you're more likely to get progress towards fixes, rather than lobbying for changes to the rules of WvW (which is far less likely to happen, imo).

I'm missing this for level ups :c I mean, for some level ups you have a selection of choices, but for those you don't, would be nice to be able to just right clicking it. 
---
Returning player, have never gotten to enjoy this event so I'm stoked! Is there a guide or TLDR of what I need to do to get the most out of it!?
---
I'm pretty excited for this, I only joined in July so this will be my first super adventure festival!
---
They *are* the bully hunters. Poor guy didn't get a copy of their script though.
---
Yeah sorry, i see small groups as 10+ lol, i tend to prefer to play solo or 2 people max :P
---
&gt;make no mistake: the warclaw has had a negative impact on every aspect of WvW except zergs. zerglings love it because it allowed them to flat out ignore every other aspect of the game, to the detriment of everybody else.
---
That is the point of my post and i am just burried in downvotes, i don't want to quit the game but the past few days i have tried to log in and play, but it just didn't work. Then what you know? I can't do anything to fix it so what then?
---
skill lag is caused by too many character interactions (damage, health, boons, conditions) in too small of an area of the map.
---
or in other words, skill lag will be a thing in WvW as long as the game mode favours big zergs above all else.
---
to get rid of skill lag, anet will have to heavily discourage big zergs from forming, and promote more smaller fights spread across bigger areas. a big 50vs50vs50 will always have exponentially higher server load (thus bigger chance of skill lag) than a bunch of smaller fights spread over the map.

she mistook a "daily win a match" for "daily win a douchebag awards"
---
Guild hall uses PvE balancing so a lot of classes are OP. Eg. Scourge shade CD is 100% faster in PvE.
---
after you open all your loot bags, salvage all, sell junk and deposit all, you are pretty much left with trophy items, overflowing mats and possibly other useless items that you'd delete. So it's somewhat sorted when you end up compacting after that.
---
If you didn't compact those trophy items would remain spread out and you'd end up searching for individual items to delete rather than deleting down a single file row. I'd say this is more efficient, it likely doesn't save very much time though and it probably goes in personal preference pile.
---
Probably more shell shocked and/or job interviewing instead of slacking off....
---
Nope.

nope

I've passed up so many upgrades I've wanted waiting for this.  Turns out I could have picked up one other other ones now that I have enough gold and gems (wasn't sure if I would when the other stuff was out).  If we don't get shared slot discount, I'll be really sad.
---
Mostly correct.  
---
They have some of the old models for LA, but most of them are in formats that aren't easily convertible to assets they use now. Also, old LA had a LOT of models in it, meaning it would require a lot of work to retool them into the current system. Not to mention tons of re-hitboxing due to mounts and such. Quite a large undertaking, but Armistice Bastion was more work than i thought they would ever put into one of those passes.   
---
If your ideal is "Attacker attacks&gt;fight happens", do not forget that the warclaw isn't the only thing that can prevent that.
---
"Attacker attacks&gt;fight happens" didn't apply to professions with stealth disengages and teleports that easily allowed them to avoid undesired combat before the warclaw.  
---
I can't count how many cowards have ran from me when things didn't go their way before the warclaw, but they were enough to make me wish we had the /fistshake emote from GW1.  
---
After the upcoming changes to warclaw, they'll have to choose between staying under stealth somewhere nearby, or mounting and risk getting chased, as a mounted player will be immune to stealth.  
---
Also, many of these builds used to rely on disengaging with stealth to have a build reset and retry a quick burst when it initially fails, as damage skills and traits usually reset faster than passive defense traits some people use to defend against these tactics.  
---
Now, using a disengage to reset risks having the enemy mount and get extra HP, making the repeated burst harder or even impossible, maybe even run away.  
---
This means that quick 1-2s bursts are much harder to pull off alone on players with mounts. Still very possible as duos, tho.  
---
So you can see that there's very different experiences for different players.  
---
I do agree that I'd be better if warclaw didn't allow such easy disengages. Players should be aware of their surroundings and stay at a safe distance and in safe spaces if they want to avoid combat. The speed difference on enemy territory will help with catching up invaders, but once they are caught, well, they should be caught.  
---
That's why I suggested reducing evade spam by giving them Exhaustion like daredevil dashes, so they can't do 4 consecutive evades as easily as they can now, and giving skill 3 the ability to also harpoon enemy warclaws, put them in combat, slow them down, and make it easier for allies to dismount them.   
---
In any case, we can't just focus on how things are, since things can change. 
---
Going back to stealth, just like warclaw needs adjustments so it can't be as much of a safe disengage tool, stealth needs adjustments too, so it can't be a safe disengage tool, but strictly a combat tactic tool. Even more than warclaw, since every profession can have access to the same warclaw, but not every profession can use stealth.    
---
As much as I'd love to have me something like 5-8s revealed in "Nothing Can Save You!", that alone would not do. We also need fundamental changes to stealth too.  In the lines of the changes they decided to make to in in Heroes of the Storm, for similar reasons too.  
---
That would be a good way to take care of it but then the people that would be needed to keep every entrance clear from trolls wouldn't be able to watch the gvg.

True. I will be honest I'm not sure at all of the setup of the map, or PvP, but I am enjoying the idea of trolling the troll.

You are partly correct. The yellow bar at the bottom of your screen and the yellow bar on the mastery page. When you are in a PoF map (including the living story that follows it), 100% of your exp goes toward the PoF mastery you are currently training. When you are in a core map (like Kessex Hills), 100% of your exp goes toward the Tyria mastery you are currently training (possibly legendary crafting for you? I recall this also has ~1,270,000 exp for the first level). If you have HoT, 100% of your exp in a HoT map (or following living story maps) goes toward your current HoT mastery. That means you can have up to 3 masteries selected at once, but which one earns exp depends what map you're in.
---
The yellow number next to a player's name is their mastery rank, or the number of mastery points they have spent. For example, if each raptor level costs 1, 2, and 3 MP respectively, if you train up to raptor 3, you will have mastery rank 6 (1+2+3). 
---
Probably not.  This is a rarity.  You'll get more reliable gold selling stuff rather than dumping it into the forge.
---
I like when they say "no skill" after you've beaten then a few times. 
---
&gt;Enjoy being toxic
---
Says the guy who immediately responded to my first post with toxicity.  
---
Oddly enough, after playing with these so called "toxic elitists" guilds for over a year, there's suspiciously little toxicity going on inside them. It's almost as if having expectations and building each other up strengthens guilds instead of splitting them up or dragging them down.
---
&gt; has. That coupled w

---
i got the scythe from a guaranteed wardrobe unlock; use it on my daredevil now... not a fan of scythes in general as a weapon but its particularily funny seeing some of the dd/rev animations slapping the wrong side of the blade around
---
To be more specific, they only said they will do something for the backpack because right now it takes years to get. They said nothing about the weapons or collection. While making red weapons themselves easier to acquire, they may as well just make the backpack directly accessible and replace the achievement reward with something random (which they can do easily, since nobody earned it yet). So I hope you are right, but my expectations are not too high.

Any bets on how long it takes for this comment to get removed?

30 April or 7 May  seem like the most likely dates

It's a public wvw arena space.

Silly thinking guildwars2 is a place for guild fights.

Niiiice gz :) I have very nice screen regarding the scythe staff, will post it here as well probably :P
---
How would this prevent episode 6 release during the 5 weeks. It seems anything Anet announces it mean living world is getting push back according to some. I wouldn't be surprised if when Anet does announce living world people will act like its coming later.
---
Well, SAB will last approx. 3 of those weeks and they don't overlap festivals with LS Updates anymore.
---
How about a better ingame tutorial for players? Most new players don‘t know about basic mechanics like break bars or what to do in this game in general.
---
It isn't.
---
Apart from all that most pvp players (including me) would actually get pissed if someone joins a ranked game just for a daily and is not putting in much effort, and obviously you meet try hards who get annoyed even in unranked games when someone is not playing up to mark. So it's better way out for both the worlds I feel.
---
Im not new. I just did not come across skill lag that was so bad up until now 
---
It's a tactic used in PvP by mesmers to finish off downed targets safely.
---
Certain actions aren't interrupted when the player enters the portal, this includes stomping downeds. The way it works is you drop the portal, start stomping, take the portal to somewhere safe where you can't be interrupted, and then go back through the portal at the last moment when the animation finishes. If done well, you killed the target.
---
[Found a gif of it](https://fat.gfycat.com/GrayLikableCockatoo.webm)
---
Unfortunately Anet killed portal altogether a few months ago so this is another part of the game that may be lost forever.
---
This is still a flawed concept, why shouldn't the dismount be instant? It should just also dismount you when you use it. You keep talking allies, but this doesn't fix the problem for especially roaming, another point is that it requires you to be on a mount to use it, making it impossible to use when you are in combat and on foot. Last, how would you still catch up with them to even use this ability if they turn around as soon as they see you in the distance?
---
Why not just do the eassier and more reasonable change of making the mount 2 dodges that share with your characters endurance bar, 50% less hp, swiftness walk speed *everywhere* but no CC on dismount. Just make it not fast af, that's all thats needed, would provide the zerg necros and firebrands with their permaswiftness still while giving all the other utility too.
---

---
3 things, how would thieves be compensated for this big nerf, how would this be fair compared to mobility which can still escape, aka Mesmers, and lastly, how would this system allow DE to be in a balanced state without massive buffs when the whole thing revolves around stealth.
---
i really hope will be some new level or no point to play this event :(
---
Thank you! 
---
Why release the next LS story on time when you can do this 😍
---
sadly we are getting neither at the moment, so it is you that is living under a rock.
---
I showed the trailer to a nonGW2 coworker expecting any sort of actual SAB gameplay/levels/anything that highlights the platforming, goofiness, difficulty, or anything really. Trailer failed to deliver. Classic Anet marketing.
---
Try it. You can undo the boost. Just don’t leave silverwaste.
---
How will a forum post on their own site reach players who are taking a break? Are they relying on word of mouth? 
---
Or launching some kind of campaign we're going to hear more about?
---
Yeah...its definitely not
---
It's kind of expected after the recent layoffs that things might get pushed back a few weeks, so.
---
Did you not get the memo? What happens in our guild hall stays in our guild hall!
---
It has always been a problem, but it got a lot worse since the last patch. Before, fights with only two servers fighting each other were playable. Now even 40 vs 40 lags like hell. Not sure if it really is related to the mount or if there fucked up something different while implementing the mount.
---
yes it just resets to 0 and you can start again. Do the Drunken Brawler solo quest dungeon in EotN with XP scroll on. Put a Lifesteal on the brass knuckles and use an Assassin(they proc dual strikes).

I don't know what drugs you're on.  But that " A bug in the system" trailer is amazing.  SAB was never meant to be a pinnacle part of GW2.  It's literally a side game. I don't know why you expect an A4 trailer from SAB but maybe you should focus  your jimmy rustling towards something productive.   
---
Almost every trailer for the LS or for a new campaign has been great.  Sounds like you're just trying to troll the game and hate it for no other reason than saying you hate it.  
---
I found it first on twitter, so I would assume it's on all of their social media now (Twitter, FB, Instagram?).

yeah i've gotten frustrated with D:OS2, did Tactical mode with Brother for the first one and he started 2 on Tactics mode, which is SUPER EFFING HARD.

And propably newsletter.

The moment it became an temp-event, 0 hope for world 3, it took them 6 months with a small team of dev to create world 2, I really don't see them taking that time again for a 3weeks event.

I agree on the stretching part, but I think it’ll be longer, like 2-3 weeks with gem store releases in between. Im feeling mid-may.

Basket Brawl is completely different, it consists of a regular ball, and 2 hoops on opposite sides of a court.

God forbid the content we pay for be delivered on time 🙄

Do you even realize that this guide can work for people that actually play the game...?

He's talking about Basket Brawl

I don't see anything wrong with a little culling. 
---
*rimshot*
---
You asked which content I have completed, I've played fractals, PvE, WvW, PvP, Dungeons, most of the story, most of the festivals ( except the ones I don't like ). You are mentioning skins as if they are "content" they are shinies, nothing more. 36 AP is not content, it's closer to being a skin than it is to playable content. Learn to read, you know I hadn't done raids. 
---
This gives me /r/place vibes...
---
Yes I am still subbed here. So threads pop up in my feed. 
---
lol take my upvote, friend
---
I don't care too much for over-moderation myself, but this is a dickhead comment. Why would new or returning players have any reason to complain about the amount of content in the game? If I stopped playing 2 or 3 years ago i'd be a bit overwhelmed with the shit I can do that is still relevant to the game.
---
It's like people forget how most MMO's are built to basically retire old content and not keep it alive. Arenanet has its failings but I love that everything made in the past few years is still active and available to play. 
---
It is sad that one of their best devs was laid off and I wonder how they can let that go, but does it mean they should abandon one of the best content in game that many players adore? And frankly 3 years, 3 times community clearly stated they love SAB and Anet just took it and shit on it, this is how all GW2 action feels like recently. Planing and decision making weren't they strongest sides but man how low they can go.
---
A natural bit of spread isn't "manspreading". Manspreading is when a dude somehow manages to take up a full seat and a half on a crowded train because of how far they're spreading.
---
If it's really about what's between your legs, I think some guys must have a really inflated opinion of the amount of space their junk needs.
---
Oh they understand. They probably don't have enough real content to release, that is why they go with this bullshit.
---
Fanboys incoming
---
I have a character who I store all my books on.  He has ~3 bags full.  I would love to have a "library" or "bookshelf" at my home that would just add lore books as I picked them up.  
---
Give us a Shopkeeper Tonic andwith a skill that makes us go "Yeaaah boi!"
---
So, nothing new announced after the layoffs...not even some kind of roadmap...but milking available content...game is not dead at all...
---
On a side note... is this the first video that they've disabled comments on?
---
Wait, legendaries can't be soulbound, or am I missing something ?
---
It's wrong. Should be Account Bind
---
Are there ways to make gold during this festival? 
---
Ha, isn't it great when people play a team-based PVP mode and then start talking about 1v1s?
---
It's like, look, I'm just trying to play the game. I can't help it if one of my teammates happened to be with me when you decided to rush the far point by yourself, man. (And that's always how it is -- one would-be champion trying to take on multiple enemies solo, then calling them losers because they "can't 1v1" him.)
---
Playing and completing a content are 2 different things.
---
Those items I mentioned requires you doing the content to acquire them. Do you have them? No? Then you haven't completed the content.
---
36k AP requires you doing a significant amount of content (nearly full completion)...you don't have it? Then you are nowhere close.
---
Why do you think I put it at the top? You haven't even touched an entire content available in the game and you're complaining about the lack of content.
---
how do you check someone’s ap?
---
It actually is, in the way that they've implemented and streamlined it.
---
I'd run at them and try to kill them lol, thats my point though, back without mounts that was the only real choice, you double dodge the longbow and then you try to kill them.
---
you actualy saying that anet is good at promoting the game? are you mentaly ok son? 5 sec vids with new legendary in every ls3,ls4? NON existent comercials,CEO telling shit like *i dont belive in promotions,just tell your friends that game is good* canceled 3rd expansion,200 ppl fired and list goes on and on,THEY made this happen,YOU can clearly see that EVERYTHING they did was not ENOUGH and your whole reasoning is so dumb/retarded/wrong that its almost funny. you are right in one thing tho,i hate anet for letting great game fall into shit,it had so much oportunity to be best mmo,but they just dont give a single fuck.
---
Agreed, I was just thinking about how overwhelming it would be to come in even buying just the expansions with all the new skins, maps, services, etc. they've added. Then with the S3/S4 episodes and all the stuff in there. I seriously cannot imagine how people have "nothing to do" in this game unless they're no-lifing for like a month straight.
---
I've been going back to Dry Top and S3 maps and it's really impressive how populated those maps are. Not OMG 50 man zergs but a good group of people doing the spirit events or killing White Mantle in Bloodstone Fen.

[ARENA NET] [Daniel Snider.6241 posted on 2019-03-22 20:35:27](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/72091/api-updates-march-22-2019):
---
&gt; Hello all,
---
&gt;I have been making some recent changes to the way that API content is updated that allows more developers into the process. The goal is to make missing data (such as nodes) less frequent. As such, the nodes list is updated and has been moved to a new url (more details below).
---
&gt;With these changes comes new code and potentially new bugs especially with having the new code mimic the way the old API works, so if you find any bugs or inconsistencies, I'd love to hear about them.
---
&gt;Also, in order to make it easier to tell if daily/weekly progress has been reset (e.g. raid clears), I've added `last_modified` to account and character endpoints. This removes the need to poll &amp; store the account `age` field (which allows serverless apps to monitor progress properly).
---
&gt;Finally, I've introduced schema versions for updated endpoints. The motivation is to prevent breaking existing apps while still allowing the API to be modified without fear. Find more details on how to use them below.
---
&gt;# Recent API Updates
---
&gt;---
---
&gt;First, here are the changes in list format:
---
&gt;* Several endpoints under `v2/account` and `v2/characters` now return a Last-Modified header. They respect If-Modified-Since requests and will properly return a 304 Not Modified.
---
&gt;* `v2/account`,` v2/characters/:id` now have a `last_modified` field in the latest schema.
---
&gt;* `v2/nodes` has moved to `v2/home/nodes`. The old endpoint is still available.
---
&gt;* `v2/cats` has moved to `v2/home/cats`. The old endpoint is still available.
---
&gt;* `v2/account/home/nodes` now contains all home instance nodes including the garden plots.
---
&gt;* `v2/account/home/cats` has an updated schema that is consistent with other similar endpoints.
---
&gt;# Schema Versions
---
&gt;Modifying the schema of an endpoint causes breakage for existing apps. This is especially bad for things like mobile apps where developers cannot force their users to update the same way web apps can.
---
&gt;To allow API flexibility without paralyzing its development, I have added the notion of schema versions to endpoints that change. They are meant to prevent an app from hard crashing due to schema failure by migrating data backward from the latest version down to the requested version.
---
&gt;This approach isn't fool-proof: If a later schema version has *less* information than the current nominal path, then the migration will have to invent some data, which can still cause app breakage, just in a different way.
---
&gt;**Schema versions can be requested with a `v` query param or an `X-Schema-Version` request header**. Schema versions are comparable strings that happen to be ISO 8601 datetimes which means string compares are chronological.
---
&gt;Here is an example of making a request with a requested schema version:
---
&gt;```
---
&gt;fetch('https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/account', {headers: {
---
&gt;    'X-Schema-Version': "2019-02-21T00:00:00Z",
---
&gt;    'Authorization': `Bearer ${my_api_key}`}
---
&gt;})
---
&gt;.then((r) =&gt; r.json())
---
&gt;.then((data) =&gt; console.log(data.last_modified));
---
&gt;Here is another example using query params:
---
&gt;fetch(`https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/account?v=latest&amp;access_token=${my_api_key}`)
---
&gt;# Using Schema Versions
---
&gt;Here is the standard approach to using schema versions in your app:
---
&gt;When creating your app, create a static schema version (the ISO 8601 formatted date you start working) to send with all of your requests. If the API changes suddenly one day, your app should be mostly unharmed because your app will still be requesting the same schema.
---
&gt;When you update your app, bump the static schema version up to that day's date and check for schema breakage before release.
---
&gt;If you don't care about your app breaking, or you're developing locally, you can use `latest` as your schema version and always get the latest schema from the API.
---
&gt;I'd love to hear your thoughts on all of this :smile: .
---
&gt;Thanks!
---
&gt;Snider
---
Wow, you're a feisty one aren't you. 
---
I disagree. Layoffs probably included some people who made PvP the way it was. Second, where have I said I expect retroactive changes? I've said in my first post that I'm looking forward to the future with the possibility of restructuring with new people. 
---
As for my responses, I respond in kind. If you come in with an ignorant, argumentative, or negative tone, you'll receive one back. Also, if you want to be taken seriously, you should make sure your &lt;10 word post is correct (referencing Zosin's comment). That's just a general rule of thumb. You sound awfully triggered for someone else's mistake. 
---
Im right now using longbow and greatsword but thinking about switching the GS, because ive beeng using it for loooong time.
---
Well, I didn't pull this out of my hat:  [https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/72073/super-adventure-festival-returns-next-week](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/72073/super-adventure-festival-returns-next-week)  Stephane confused me:  Today, we’re announcing that Super Adventure Festival returns next week, from March 28 through April 16! 
---
Hard disagree that gw2 has no PvP potential, just think it is/was mismanaged.

---
API getting some love again really good.
---
It's right at the title: **This is the right path**.
---
I expect them to get better at it, and for this to be just the beginning.
---
No, you don't have the right to complain about the "lack of content", because there is no "lack of content".
---
As I said before:
---
&gt; Just because a specific type of content does not interest you, does not mean that content does not exist.
---
You're just one of the many delusional and ignorant, self-entitled little children that scream loud and proud, under the false impression of being correct - you are not.
---
You may, correctly so, complain about the rate of content release...but not the "lack of content". They are two completely different and isolated problems. Don't be an ignorant man-child, and your life will be a lot less stressful.
---
You cant play season 4 without a purchase. That's the opposite of free.
---
On the chat tab itself, click the down arrow to customize what you see on that tab, and go to "Game Messages" and "Contacts" and makes sure both are checked.
---
I'm a returning player and I have no fucking clue about break bars so I actively avoid them until I have the time to read up on how to do it, as well as everything else new since the expansions came out.
---
Why couldn't they just send an email to the email address that's on the account without requiring a serial code? Some people bought the game digitally, so it wouldn't be too imaginative to think if somehow a hacker got your email access, they would also have your serial key on hand to reset the password.
---
My wife's account was setup, and hasn't been accessed since the 2FA password reset requirement, and I don't believe she got an email about she should go in and setup 2FA so she could eventually reset her password down the road sometime (I could be wrong).
---
It is our fault that we cannot access the account and doesn't have whatever correct information they need to reset the account password, I'm saying the process is shit.
---
That would imply I here to begin with
---
Did it hurt, writing that incomprehensible wall of text because of your inability to comprehend what was responded to you?
---
Armistice Bastion also allows the "return to previous map" and the portal to Aerodrome. You don't get easy access to Fractals (you need to go to Lion's Arch and then use the Fractal portal), but you do get access to WvW team chat and a WvW dueling arena.
---
I'm hopeful we'll get a raider's pass that grants direct access into raid instances from the zone, with "return to previous map" so that I can park all my raid characters at useful overworld spots without losing that spot every time I want to take them into a raid.
---
Are dungeons back or new SAB worlds? If not, I'm not returning to this game that was ruined by the heads of ANET.
---
Hi, I'm a fanboy.
---
cool!!!
---
Why royal terrace instead of Armistice Bastion, which offers the same excellent "return to map" feature that Mistlock Sanctuary does?
---
Granted what I was quoting was from waaayyy back in 2013/2014, but it's nice to see the bad experience didn't kill off his interest. But at the same time, it's sad we will never see those ideas come to life.
---
Yea, gw2 just hasn't been as engaging as it once was. I made 4 legendaries, finished the story on 3 characters, max leveled and got a good gear set on 9, and now I just kinda log in for a day to do the new story on my main, then wait a few months for the next one. 
---
It's where I play more gw1 than 2 now because it has more content. 
---
It's basically a cc until the cc works meter. Sometimes it'll boost damage the mob receives. 
---
*these* really aren't. Mistlock Sanctuary and Armistice Bastion both offer the unique feature to return to your overworld position from the lounge, which is nice if you need to quickly do banking/tp/crafting/vendor without losing your world position. Mistlock Sanctuary also offers a direct entrance to Fractals, bypassing Lion's Arch entirely.
---
She was being a whiny little bitch is all. They were probably in discord and not reading mapchat so didn't see that you were in for dailies. The few times I ever went in for mine in a room like this people were killing each other or jumping off and I had no idea why. After a while someone yelled they were gonna ban me for not following the rules. When I said I had never been in a room like this and what was I supposed to do, they started calling me a troll also.
---
I think it's simply that people like this develop the rules over months and months and then get upset that strangers suddenly do not follow whatever fantasy they have. I stopped doing pvp dailies and now never log in. It used to be a fun game.
---
I have no complaints about the game tbh! People like drama and trolls will be trolls! Gw2 is a great game! I personally wish they added more cash shop armor and not outfits :p 
---
Awesome! Good to see one of the easiest/most straightforwardly-structured API's I've ever used getting some love.
---
People are critical because they care.  People are unconstructive because they are emotional.
---
Don’t assume everything negative comes from malicious intent simply because you can’t put yourself in their shoes.
---
Also I don’t see the doom &amp; gloom that you seem to see (at least on Reddit).  Seems to me that there is a healthy variety of opinions that make this platform useful for discussions.
---
OH MY GOD!
---
People who are happy and content aren't motivated to spend all their time complaining on forums. 
---
Actually they update achievements and rewards for every festival every year.
---
He's right tho? Same mistake as baiting players into WvW before fixing the game mode...
---
Let's not get too excited and put the cart before the horse.
---
&gt; Boring. Nothing new. Same content for years.
---
Intresting, I only can see a SAB Choya running around. When did I miss the part where it shows any content so that you can say there's nothing new? 
---
(Actually there seems to be a new SAB Choya tonic.)
---
Compromised email addresses are the single biggest security weakpoint that is exploited to steal accounts like this, This is the whole reason two factor authentication became so prevalent. Anets requirements for account recovery are perfectly sound and the real criticism should be aimed at services that don't have similar requirements.
---
The process isn't convoluted and shitty, it's secure. There are inherent drawbacks to a user who wants to gain access to their account after forgetting the convenient access method.
---
Or fixing the the bait.
---
Sell Furniture Coins via guilds.
---
They already did their nerf when they set a limit on the other thing that teleports you.
---
I actually posted this because I am genuinely interested to get other perspectives on why people act like this. I myself care an awful lot about this game, and since this is one of the main platforms the devs use to communicate with the community, I can't help but feel worried about how long it will be before they just give up because everything they ever get seems to be negative.
---
Like I said, I understand criticism, but I feel that the emotional part is what's putting us in danger of Anet giving up on trying to please anyone.
---
These are people we're talking about, and this type of negativity can cut deep.
---
Even more communication! Loving this !!
---
While I know of what break bars are, each time I have to deal with one I have to stop, consider what class I am playing. Then look up break bars on the wiki, see what skills my class has to break them, see if my build has them, check what keys to click aaaaand the fight is over.
---
Since the skills used are different for each class/build and it can be any key or key combo or even correct spinner of the key, I just shrug and let the few highly skilled players deal with it. Of course I no longer even play as the game has gotten so far out of my ability range that it's unplayable for me now.
---
A new SAB map as minimum the same work as a new LS map. I don't know why so many people demanding this every year only because this two houses in the lobby.
---
my b, i thought schools still taught kids to read. i understood your message, it was just wrong.
---
I was indeed having some pun with that last bit. :D
---
Welcome to the Guild Wars 2 Reddit, where 95% of the people here can't get enough of telling you how much they hate Guild Wars 2
---
most overhyped festival, halloween and christmas way more better ones
---
You thought wrong, considering you have absolutely no idea how to type properly.
---
&gt; These are people we're talking about, and this type of negativity can cut deep.
---
I agree with you on this point, but I'd like to point out that you're projecting your perspective across two decently sized platforms and claiming it as a consensus of those platforms' general attitudes.  And I contest that: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/b3wspv/communication_this_is_the_right_path_good_job/
---
Going to be so much easier to track daily login status etc. for alt accounts now too.  No more checking the guild panel :D
---
There's no limit to your idiocy, is there?
---
Right, like I said, no trailer would have been better.
---
Which doesn't mean that the channels on it are large, it really just means that it has lots of channels. Which means that any other person you met is unlikely to watch the same selection as you do. 
---
I wouldn't worry about negative feedback on Reddit causing the game to shut down. Reddit's a pretty small cross-section of the playerbase. 
---
For every angry/negative person on Reddit there's most likely many, many quietly happy players.
---
very pood damage control. oh look, failed.
---
Man I really tried getting back to GW2 a couple of times, but everything that  I loved about it is in shambles and not worth diving in (WvW and PvP) =/
---
As a Belgian player, I'm hoping for that too ...
---
&gt; Also your argument is very poor, and is incredibly unintelligent.
---
Aha, thanks for insulting.... no more arguments to bring in or what's the problem? Because a lack of arguments are often a reason to start insulting. 
---
Just calling my arguments "poor" and "incredibly unintelligent" without any counter arguments, any reasons nothing. You have *nothing* left to say, but can't let my arguments go through, because then you would "lose" to it. 
---
So you just start insulting without any reason like "*yeah, you said that and I have no arguments against that... but your arguments are stupid!*".
---
**That's** very poor and incredibly unintelligent. 
---
However, this forum and subreddit has rules and you start a thread to complain that Anet don't do what you want **and** start insulting people who don't share your opinion. 
---
That's quality post for sure!
---
I was about to say that :/
---
Another sale not available for Belgium ... (even I didn't really care for the 1st one)
---
Here's my shortlist of gw2 shortcomings that need fixing:
---
* Rewardstructure of PvE endcontent: theres no point in repeating raids challenge modes, no point in repeating raids more than once a week, no point in repeating fractal cms, no point in doing any normal fractal that isnt daily. Basically anything that would be fun for me to spend more time on, has timegated rewards. Sure, I can repeat those anyway, but getting not even half the rewards compared to just opening chests in SW... that actively dissuades me from even bothering. What we need is the same rewards level in every gamemode, with additional timegated rewards in form of extra EXP and a RNG dropchances for accountbound rare skins. The fact that something like SW has highest rewards in the game is appalling, a disgrace and a shame.
---
* Anet focusing way too much on the singleplayer aspects (living story) instead of the multiplayer aspects (metas, worldbosses, wvw, pvp, instanced pve). This actually really boggles my mind. Anet neglects everything that makes gw2 as a mmo shine and instead focuses on a mediocre story.
---
* Balance: The balance is all over the place, with some gamemodes not getting any balance or only minimal balancing that would actually NEED that balancing to become enjoyable endcontent. Wvw balance is non-existent. PvP balance is meh. Raid balance is a mess, but its not that important there. 
---
"Girls"
---
I see your point. They definitely do not need the whole 1-80 system that the 5 other races do since the race is locked to those that buy the expansion anyway
---
she probably did, it happens a lot these days where people use a word incorrectly so often that it becomes meaningless to those who hear it and actively harms real victims, and people who are actually the real definition of the word (racist etc) are not viewed as such because ordinary people have heard it used so many times that it's just a situation straight out of the boy who cried wolf.
---
It's always been a thing, and it always will be. But all said, the forum crusaders were way worse in the GW1 / Guru days.
---
The game is on it's death bed why do this?
---
GRAND LION GRIFFON MOUNT SKIN WHEN?
---
Really!?  Why?  What happened?  Where can I read about it?
---
Now I'm curious what you thought a choya infusion would look like
---
Dungeons never went anywhere and are more profitable than they were during their heyday.
---
But why let facts get in the way of trolling, eh?
---
100% YUP !!
---
colin was awesome!
---
there's no limit to your vulgarity, is there? keep going through life insulting people when you are wrong, proud of you
---
Isn't there a mobile authenticator as well? That should be solid proof too, wouldn't it?
---
Not sure. I've only used lv75+ items. Got 1 Bloodbound scepter and 1 Severed Dagger out of the recipe so far.
---
You probably want to keep the average level at 75 anyway for the chance at a precursor or at least some sort of exotic with a decent sigil. 
---
Well, perhaps not, but bad news by it's very nature is much louder than positivity, so it can quickly seem that the whole platform is out at your neck. I'm well aware that after the last LW release, there was a huge amount of praise toward what they did right, but now with a few controversial changes and enough time passing and it's back to business as usual.
---
I don't demand, don't put words in my mouth or tell me what I think.
---
Not adding new content to that "yearly festival" witch is one of the best content in all GW2 history, and not taking all of potential from it is stupid.
---
Many players can and should be attracted by festivals.
---
GW2 is dying cuz of poor decisions, and this is one of them, I am afraid that is already too late for this game and that is shame cuz they wasted a lot of potential that game has.
---
Just make the mount slower and give an insta dismount way, if the mount has 2 dodges and swiftness speed with half HP but no CC on dismount there is zero problems.
---
They laid it off
---
Anet devs answerd to the demand of a new SAB world and said how long it would take to create. It was several months, more or less the time they need to make a LS episode. 
---
And if you think of what we have in W1 and 2, everything of this would be needed in W3 too. Three new maps plus bonus, new SAB-ingame weapons/items, new enemys/models (at least no voice acting), new trib mode for all 3 maps, new reward items, ne achievements and so on.
---
They also said that they rather work on new, permanent content than taking so much time for a content update that is only accessible for 3 weeks per year. 
---
As was said by MightyTeapot a little bit ago “the ones who are the most upset, often are the loudest. While those who are content, are silent in their satisfaction” or something like that
---
I love how despite the recent setbacks, ANET has been on fire ever since, with a rapid slew of updates.
---
I don't kiss and tell &lt;3 your secret is safe with me ;] 
---
Without resorting to conspiracy theories(and assuming I haven't missed some important bits of news) the layoffs were due to ANet mismanagment by allocating resources **away from GW2**. This means any comments about GW2 positive or negative is pretty much irrelevant as far as the layoffs are concerned.
---
No amount of positivity or negativity about the game is going to fix management.
---
I've seen people using character names being used for account recovery, which we gave several as possiblities and also classes she would of played, also the physical address at the time of account registration. If they didn't ask for physical address or name on the ticket we wouldn't of sent in ID anyhow. We gave all the other information, just don't have the last 4 on the card used to purchase or serial key. 
---
There's no point arguing, it's what it's, IMHO the process is not great.
---
this is not communication we want. its some crappy talking here and there.
---
That thread is on the front page now and has nothing to do with the previous LW episode.
---
Equip ranged like every other class that need to bring down mounts. Or not bring a warrior at all. But of course we know why he brings a warrior. Because its effing strong in melee duels. I'm sure all the non-warriors weep in solidarity for how impotent the poor warrior is on a mount.
---
Yeah to be fair I'm an absolute PvP noob!
---
You're welcome =D Great job! Our hall has a little monster but nothing is as cute as this! I'll take screenshot when I'm home xD 
---
&gt; You can undo the boost. 
---
Wait whaat
---
It's like we have actual development going on with GW2 now...
---
Ah! Everyone agrees, must be right   
---
Guardian is probably the easiest and most forgiving class for a beginner. You are very tanky, have lots of dodges (because your tomes (F1, F2, F3) are a weapon swap) as well as stun breaks and stability.
---
You have to keep in mind that players in your group rely heavily on you, but if you tell your squad mates that you are a new guardian player, they will probably give you a lot of advice and a second guard in your group if there is one available. Every Zerg is happy about more guard players, so don't hesitate to ask questions or tell them that you are new to guardian.
---
I scroll down in the comments all the time as well.  The unjustified vitriol nearly always hits the bottom while the passionate criticism stays near the top.  You'll find whatever you look for here.
---
Yup, you can see NPCs and terrain when you play the Personal Story.
---
Yeah, some things might be missing, but far from "gone forever" status.
---
I would say it is BECAUSE of it. It's like NCSoft talked some senes into them.
---
What's wrong about custom arena win trading?
---
I see hate/fanboy posts all around.
---
Every 8 days there's a top voted post about how "GW2 ruined other MMOs for me"/"Mounts in GW2 are the best implementation of mounts in media"/"GW2 is so much more consumer friendly than McDonalds"/"Guys, stop making jokes about the layoffs!!"
---
It's still early to say. stuff coming out now likely was all in the works before the shake up. the Devs who did this have likely spent much more effort than a few weeks of work to get this out. 
---
Christ, we need to make you gofundme to get you Infinite gathering tools and 3 shared inv slots so you can drop them there for all your chars
---
I have a bank tab full of them too. Half of them can be repurchased or stored in the book case. So you can trash those. It should only be a row and a half after.
---
Ive been playing gw2 for about 3 years and everytime SAB comes around, I get excited but then something irl happens. Last year my ex dumped my ass &gt;\_&gt;
---
I'd recommend getting in your server's discord. Do a few rallies with what ever and see which class is in demand.
---
I have to be honest, I have no clue where I'd find my servers discord info.
---
Okay, the 2(.5) weapon sets and 1(.5) armour sets were also welcomed, and done well. But the beetle racing is hardly a side story, it was just an elaborate advertisement disguised as ‘content’
---
Basket Brawl was one of the most fun activities I've ever played. I desperately hope it sees a comeback, even if only every once in a while.
---
I mean you could just ask the community  is super helpful 
---
Me too thanks
---
NCSoft to Anet: "Welcome back to GW2!"
---
Anet to the players: "Welcome back to GW2!"
---
is this whiteknighting
---
I mean, new dungeons... I was one of the kind of people that liked to solo Arah and really enjoyed that content on parties, Fractals were nice, but werent as fun as dungeons.
---
Can someone give a simplified version for those of us with little brains
---
CC is credit card! It's how you buy lootboxes in videogames! People say, Use CC, and I opened store. Then got mad at me for some reason for not using CC??
---
Basically a minute in, Hadi telling us that he's a scumbag that hunts zerg builds with his roamer build.
---
The community seems to really like her, but she has never done anything that suggested to me she was good at her job. I've had only unpleasant interactions with her in-game.
---
So I'm inclined to believe that she was part of the problem because I don't really like her, but my only evidence is anecdotal. 
---
Every single one of your arguments has been easily countered at this point, and yet you continue to grasp at straws making very weak arguments. 
---
What do you expect from people? No one has time to waste on someone who is not willing to admit defeat.
---
items do rotate in and out of the gem store, it's just that we never really know when they'll be available outside of the themed holiday ones. 
---
Raper is powerful as AOE DPS.
---
Sounds like they can more easily update and fix the API now without fearing for old apps. That's awesome!
---
"I don't need toxic people in a game i play for fun"
---
Especially not when the rest of the server shares this attitude or at least is willing to follow someone like this.
---
The gem store rotation is all up to anet, we can expect items to rotate back in or have some other option to get them ([statuettes](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Lion_Statuette) for instance) but we don't know when that will be. [This old thread](https://forum-en.gw2archive.eu/forum/game/gw2/Gemstore-items-new-sales-discounted-prices) recorded gem store sales and changes and it looks like they are continuing it on [this new thread](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/458/news-gemstore-items-new-returned-sales). [GW2Timer also has a section](http://gw2timer.com/?page=Account&amp;section=Gem) to set alerts when a specific gem store item is on sale or available again.
---
She was pretty nice in the GW1 days with the QA sessions in LA. When GW2 came along she seemed to turn bitter, and wasnt as friendly. 
---
Oh sweet ty
---
Chilling with the one with everything EXCEPT eyeballs.
---
You were being an ass and you know it. Accept it and move on. Let people have their opinion.
---
&gt;you already made 
---
No, I didn't, I just addressed a single individual in a single instance.
---
Lmao
---
Sorry sir
---
How rude!
