and my point still stands, if you can hit 80% on the golem you are doing fine. you don't need to hit 90-95% to be a great raider, I never said anything about consistency, that was implied but I guess it must be said. Dead dps is no dps, you dodging because you didn't realize Sam was about to do his slam in the middle of your rotation where most of your burst is located (with all of your skills up) is an issue and will severely limit your dps, especially if you get hit and slung. Give me someone who can hit 70% and do the mechanics perfectly over someone who face tanks half the mechanics and can hit 100% any day, even then the DPS requirements to kill are not high, at all. they sit around 50-80k per boss, yes DPS is king because you skip mechanics, you skip bad RNG and you skip most of the fight but that doesn't mean you hitting 80% vs 90% consistently is a major factor in you being good or not, if you can't time your barrier correctly on VG it doesn't matter how good DPS you have you will struggle like hell to get a kill, it's not impossible (it's been done) but it's insanely hard.

---
---
I mean it's veeeeeery easy.
---
Well hopefully we’ll see better and faster balance now that they have a dedicated competitive balance person. I personally love the mode, and wish I’d started sooner. I’ve gotten my guildies to start playing it, and hope that more people join, such as this new player.
---
What? Haven’t heard anything about this
---
Threw a [video](https://youtu.be/7VPoUob-qGs) together. If you have the essence ability unlocked, the breakbar/fight is trivial.
---
I'm thinking thats a bug with the achievements?  I couldn't see why they need to reset them.
---
It doesn't reset becaues it's intended.
---
Much easier than it needs to be, the essence abilities make the breakbar/fight trivial.  
---
  
---
[Video Link](https://youtu.be/7VPoUob-qGs)
---
Is it a repeatable?  I'm not on to check
---
It's so dumb in the first place that they made them rotate. There's already so little instanced content, and they decide to timegate a bunch of it too.
---
Yes, it's repeatable. You get the 4 ap every day and they get removed every day.
---
What's the point in doing it then LOL
---
this is the 99% of gw2 comunity
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
&gt;  mean what if I was at like 19,999 ap.. I do this achievement.. get my achievement box.. next reset back to 19,999 again.. do it again.. do I get another achievement box?
---

---
The game remembers that you unlocked the 20k box. I tried it at 20.5k
---
there are some pretty good arrangements on musescore for guild wars piano sheet music :)
---
judging by how easy the other 2 are also, and anet basically overhyping the description of boneskinner in general, i wouldnt be surprised if its not bugged (besides respawning after you kill him) and anet just thinks this is actually challenging..
---
theyve said a lot of things that it turns out are blatant lies or overhyping.
---
here is the best one https://www.ayinmaiden.com/skyscale
---
Why should it be insanely hard like raids?  I don't want spend a week practicing to beat a boss
---
&gt;2. I really can only get gold if I ask people I know who do decent enough DPS and we have some sanity of bringing quickness or alacrity at the minimum. With open world LFG, you get a plethora of dwarf stance heralds, healing tempests, and condition base warriors. 
---
Isn't the point of Strike Missions to gradually introduce casual players to Raids and the mechanics involved so that they can learn from them?
---
Actually thought it was pretty challenging to get gold with a pug where everyone did less than 10k dps.
---
It looks like a cut scene.
---
Definitely bugged. He stopped attacking at around 75%. After that we killed him, picked up rewards and about 1 min before the strike mission closed he respawned and we got to fight him until the instance kicked us
---
I do hope this is bugged because even when he respawned after we got the loot we tried to kill him a second time and nearly got him in the minute left in the instance. This should have been harder.
---
I kinda hoped there'd be an expensive version you could farm for that would also serve as a mobile cooking station tbh
---
I've done it 3 times now. Still nothing. I just want my chest of loyalty and my 4 gold from dailies and Teq.
---
What in the world...
---
Why even give them AP if they're meant to reset every day? Who even came up with this?
---
I dunno, if you played Sylvari you heard more than ambiguous violent nothings, and so did Canach.
---
It's content designed for active play, not passive play. We came to play, not watch and do nothing. The latter is why most folks own a tv or Netflix subscription.
---
I was honestly going to go and address each of your points individually.. but nah. This is honestly one of the most fucking pathetic things I've read off this sub in a long time. holy shit
---
People tend to forget snowcrows share build and guides for SPEEDCLEAR not casual raiding. These builds are designed with perfect boons and synergies. Most of the times those build can be tweeted to better fit an average group.
---
Definitely intended that it literally stops attacking halfway through and then respawns after you loot it. Obviously.
---
Yes, but it's a caveat that new raiders won't know about. Potentially wasting their time and losing self-esteem.
---
No, everyone has the same chance.
---
Boonthief, Shetsa with signet of courage, this remind me of something !  
---
Wait why is shetsa not dying at the end when he should use his signet ? :O  
---
Oh my bad , wrong KC with boonthief ( Great kill !)
---
sell account -&gt; report as stolen -&gt; get password reset
---
That because you didn't say you color at the event !
---
I expected them to be part of quest for saving frostbitten soldiers all over the map. Sadly, it wasnt. Maybe in next episode?..
---
Having the exoansions does give you some advantages over not having the expansions.
---
However, Is hardly call that pay to win, so the answer is a solid no.
---
Hey boss.
---
If everyone did this the game wouldn't exist because Arenanet wouldn't generate revenue. If you don't want to support the game, go support a other one. Why linger here telling others to boycott a product they enjoy and a company they support?
---
All classes are good. You'll find none of them for an archetype ypure used to and those that do on the surface will provide enjoyment you would assume you wouldn't find.
---
This is the only mmo i've played where I enjoy every class. I exclusively play mages and assassins in other games but in this one I play everything. Even warrior is enjoyable and that's literally the one class I avoid like the plague everywhere else.
---
They sort of do share progress actually. The hearts are down to you, but many dynamic events progress quicker with groups making contributions. Also the story progress can be shared if you are willing to make the same decisions. You'll have fun exploring the world together (that's a big part of this game) so don't worry about it and just jump in. Also don't worry about classes. Anything can be played. You don't need the holy trinity.
---
DON'T USE THIRD PARTY SERIAL CODES!!! If \*anything\* is wrong with them, Anet can't support you. They only support their own codes and verified partner codes, like from amazon. It would royally suck to get a code and not have it work, and then lose your $$.
---
Since others have said what needed to be said (sell it back, salvage for ecto, etc), this aside, i just wished they are stackable Q.Q
---
I bought a lot of same weapons too, i thought they stacked, but they filled up my already limited inventories, now i cant collect anything else from TP until i finished collecting the weapons which still have a lot to go. Lol
---
Yeah no. JP shouldnt be able to be portable or cheesed.
---
Great piece of content most people have no clue how to do. they just go for these PINK dudes that help them cheese the JP.
---
if rewards are the issue, they should be buffed.
---
Making JP integrity bad is not a solution.
---
even if you dont, none of his abilities do enough damage to be a threat anyway.
---
Thanks a bunch! Especially for explaining what's expected for necros and scourge. Now I know haha - I've definitely fallen into the pitfalls you warn about (bad at 1v1, *really* bad at running or going far) before. Though the inexperience is really the biggest killer, so hopefully with a bit more practice all will be fine. Thanks again :)
---
GW2's target audience, right there.
---
The PoF guild hall (Windswept Haven) drops obsidian shards, it doesn't drop tenebrous &amp; shimmering crystals. Tenebrous crystals only drop from Gilded Hollow (Auric Basin), and shimmering crystals only drop from Lost Precipice (Verdant Brink).
---
Yes!! This is awesome. I’ll be trying this. Thanks!
---
I main memser. Got Legendary Armor, Sword, and Shield. Any "safe" stat infusions to invest for Fractals? I already have Max Agony Resist.
---
The pulsing damage needs to be increased by quite a lot. Its not a hard fix but will they do it is the question.
---
Power is always safe since you can't max out in that.
---
Scrapper is fun and tanky. 
---
Using flamethrower is fun to 😊
---
Just pugged it and got gold with ~45 seconds left, first try.
---
We failed a couple breaks and there appeared to be no penalty. We lit none of the torches and nobody was ever in danger of dying. I stood directly in his attacks and took less damage than I would from regular mobs in the open world.
---
What exactly happened here? Did they not test it? Did they not balance it? Someone said the penalty for not lighting torches is escalating torment stacks, but if that's the case then did nobody on the team think so say "oh crap condi cleanse removes the mechanic"?
---
I second this.
---
The game is free. Install it and try it.
---
That's the problem... we post publicly how to defeat them, and suddenly that gets fixed
---
The reset may not be a bug, but the AP still showing is (I guess), and if it really is a repeatable achiev, it should also get the "done it x times" under it.
---
The good thing is that most achievement hunters have completed all the achievements for that map (or they will once they do the Boneskinner strike) so they will never have to look at this tab of the hero panel again.
---
This will just result in either sex addiction (also bad) or an annoyed sweetie who's pissed that the addict is STILL always on their video game.
---
&gt;for legendary armor you need rank 1700-2000, thats an eternity.
---
Still easier than the PvE path, which does not exist. I'm rank 21,000 in PvE, still no Legendary Armor. 
---
&gt;(also if there's no legendary armor available in pve, that likely is because u cannot be that bad to need it if u only play pve.) 
---
There is zero skill requirement for WvW.
---
&gt;this pve-over everything mentality is quite biased too. it doesn't affect people who don't ever want to play against any other player even a bit what happens in wvw, so keep your salt levels low. that is simply no excuse for abandoning the game mode completely.
---
The reason they abandoned the game mode completely is because most of the players did. Development costs time, and it became not worth the time to continue developing WvW. And *then* they continued developing WvW for six years after that, so be grateful.
---
i like this whole AT is basicly free farm for sindererr and his 4 buddies...,but OK!
---
For open world and story, WP has a build on his channel that uses Kalla/Shiro, but you can go Kalla/Jalis instead.
---
I consider myself a vet by now, but I got my brother into the game few months ago.
---
Tried to get him into wvw but it's not his thing and after dailies he gets bored really fast, so we switched to pve. I'm taking it slow with him, together we did all of his story and now I'm carrying him through t2 fractals and explaining the bosses and mechanics, and helping him craft his first ascended set so he can join me in t4. Even gave him some advice how to do his rotation and while not meta yet he does better in terms of dps and survivability than other players in that range.
---
If you and your group of friends are all new just take it slow and don't rush, there's plenty of stuff to do whether it be open world map metas, instanced pve or pvp and wvw
---
I was testing it and taking some screenshots to record that the AP wasn't increasing with each puzzle completion. It didn't -- until I logged out and back into the game client and the AP for the three puzzles that I completed were there.
---
I'll edit my previous comment, since things are clearly weirder than I was initially seeing. Even if they intend these achievements to reset (and they really shouldn't), the way it's handling the AP is still messed up and buggy.
---
**With 425 cooking is the cooking station available in home instances belonging to non-chef characters?**
---
The bank access is super-useful! I got to 450 on my chef alt, but then on my non-chef main there was no cooking station, so no bank access.
---
The sliding schedule had good intentions but I think this is definitely less confusing overall.
---
It is an exception, that's why it's the dominating MMO by far.
---
There is no place for tanky builds in fractals, but i suggest looking into this build - https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/firebrand/heal/ - its very overpowered in fractals and can carry very hard.
---
You're kind of right, but with experience on a class comes an understanding of how to recover your rotation when something goes wrong or when you have to cancel or skip this or that because of a boss mechanic. Knowing how to recover a dps rotation or how to improvise and keep things on track is the most important thing and it's why a lot of people find themselves benchmarking really well on the golem, then not doing well against bosses, because when things get off track a bit they panic and end up just wasting time while skills recharge so they can get back to how they practiced. 
---
You have to allow yourself the creative freedom during boss fights to improvise from time to time when you're off schedule. Don't stifle your rotation so you can get back to where you're comfortable, try something new and see how it works. Maybe you lose dps, maybe you don't. But you'll never figure out how to fully optimize unless you allow yourself the opportunity to freestyle a bit during actual boss fights.
---
I haven’t played since I unlocked the Skyscale, what did I miss?
---
&gt; You won't realistically hit the dps benchmark of your build/class unless the boss is ~~just a damage sponge~~ Mursaat Overseer. 
---
FIFY.
---
It takes zero effort to put on exotic gear and join an lfg to fight cairn in wing 4. He was my first boss ever, and we killed him in 15 minutes after two tries. Just joining a group and putting in a minimal amount of effort to help out my team allowed me to get the kill. This is true for half a dozen raid bosses, and then I finally decided to try for the harder ones. There are some I still haven't killed, and that's okay. But I at least put in the effort to get somewhere.
---
What I'm trying to say is that the fear you have for these raid bosses isn't justified. If you don't have exotic fear, you can even buy it on the trading Post for a few gold. I sympathize with not wanting to make this game a job because I only play an hour or so per day. But I think you shouldn't knock raids until you give it a real, decent try.
---
Rotation? I wvw, no need for rotation. Know the enemy, predict their actions. A rotation won't work in wvw.
---
Ok, you didn't get it. Consistency is about muscle memory. Hitting one 90% every 10th try means you press buttons randomly and have to focus on button presses in order to hit good numbers. If you hit good numbers consistently, you have the muscle memory to execute in higer pressure fights, eg to pay attention to mechanics while doing so.
---
A DPS player who dies because he was focused on his rotation needs to do more golem so that he doesn't need to focus to execute.
---
Hope it's clearer now
---
very nice sallad. nutricious, no doubt.
---
tell me; does it wield the Saladbolg as preferred weapon?
---
Lol just find a class you like and start playing virgin.
---
You can take a look at the [list of available mastery points for Icebrood Saga](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mastery_point_unlocks#The_Icebrood_Saga_mastery_points) to have them presented more nicely.
---
So from you description we can mark the Insights, Treasure Hunter, Ice-Bound and The Invitation. 
---
An easy one (30 min collection give or take a bit of time to get a Boneskinner kill) would be to complete the collection [The Hunger](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Hunger) as it's just running around killing a few mobs, delivering items you get from said mobs and needs 50 Ice Shards. It also allows you to get access to a very affordable stat-selectable Ascended Amulet (125 Ice Shards and 50k Karma so basically free).
---
Then after that it's either doing the meta event 15 times or farming Ice Shards + Ingots to start the the Restored Boreal collection (the mastery point is available very quickly since you only need 5 restored weapons if I can read correctly).
---
Stop being so salty. SC has an entire guide for each spec which basically gives you all the tricks on how to execute on each boss, aswell as numbers to aim for on each boss. So basically what you just asked for, plus more.
---
&gt;Sure, all these tricks (and I insist on calling them tricks) are theoretically usable in raids, but the average (or, worse, the beginner) raider in GW2 will not be able to practically use it.
---
It's almost as if mastering the tricks and small optimizations of your character was the difference between average and good players, another shocking revelation !
---
Just play pvp and rage quit in 2 games.
---
Some of the devs responsible for raids and fractals either left the studio or got replaced to living story teams. Sad thing because I think dating from end of 2015 up until let's say 2016 we had the hayday of GW2 in terms of Raid releases, more specifically boss encounters and mechanics.
---
Thank you much, judging by that I will have a look at gw again. Did they increase the maximum level again?
---
Max level is still 80 as it was at release time and there is no new tier of gear either. They did introduce a few new Masteries with the first episode of the Icebrood Saga so I think the new top mastery level is 303. However those new masteries only make sense/are only useful on the new map so you're not missing on anything until you get there.
---
Also Wintersday is around the corner probably December 17th since we have a balance patch today.
---
I personally use Glint-Jalis or core Rev Shiro-Jalis for WvW.
---
It is also possible to run Mallyx-Glint, I myself did play a Condi Rev with Mallyx Glint for a period of time, and it took alot of people by surprise because yur Condition upkeep is very high, and people underestimate the power of Banish Enchantment.
---
Theres also ranked arena. And at lvl31 you get access to world vs world.
---
Lfg usually has teams looking for more people, join some and maybe you will find 4 that will remain with you
---
Have you tried something like this?
---
https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/17/17363528/xbox-adaptive-controller-disability-accessible
---
I think what he was getting at [was](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUt7UYUMynw)
---
Can someone explain the difference between "build template" (the 3 tabs across the top) and "build storage" (the 3 tabs along the left hand side) in the hero window? I don't understand the difference.
---
None of these dev posts mentions AP, so i'm guessing the part where you lose AP everyday is a bug. Some other posts I read on reddit saying that you can sometimes get your AP back by switching map tends to confirm it.
---
Video games are discriminating people with no hands.
---
You only should paint in black and white since thats the only thing colorblind can see.
---
How dare you eat dinner when there's people starving??
---
Shouldnt limit something because theres someone out there who is unable to do it. Theres plenty of other stuff people can do if they are unable to click space bar to jump.
---
I don't think it is bugged at all.....
---
If you are good enough to react properly to mechanics in fight then you should be good enough to hit 90%+ on benches consistently. If you cant press buttons on a target golem correctly then what chances do you have of pressing buttons AND reacting to mechanics in an actual fight?
---
For scourges they mostly day bomb/drop wells. But imma roamer, and I need to adjust to what the enemy does. Not what optimal damage I can pull by doing skill 1&gt;2&gt;3 or whatever. That'll waste cool downs. Pull the skill you need to pull to counter the enemy is more important than high dps
---
I bet you thousand gems we will never going to see CMs for these strikes.
---
Anet loves to give out vague wordings like "its on table" or "if strikes seem popular, we will consider adding cm".
---
Anet has no dignity or credibility left.
---
Bots are common even at lower ratings. It's just that players who are literally rated lower than bots often cant even tell they're being farmed by them. 
---
In order not to get match made with bots around 1500 elo, you need to be very low. I've seen 1200s matched with 1650s quite a few times.
---
actually sind won tournament of legends and a mAT then quit for months and lost the recent one
---
I don't feel like it's too repetitive.
---
I find the lack of capitalisation on `anger` disturbing though but otherwise it was cool.
---
The sub likes to pretend everything is great, but its 99% pve players.
---
Wvw and pvp has amazing combat and systems. Unfortunately they've been neglected for years. Community is small, full of pve players trying to farm rewards with very little competition.
---
Pvp is a bot farmfest, wvw is an afk farmfest.
---
It would just completely defeat the purpose of a benchmark if they purposefully gimped themselves and didn't use optimal strategies. I always felt like they should do what they consider to be 10 "optimal" rotations and take the average DPS of those 10 attempts as the benchmark instead of grinding RNG for the perfect run, but beyond that the "tricks" you speak of are just simply being optimal and the point of these benchmarks are to show what you can achieve if you do everything right. People have taken to comparing themselves to the benchmarks, but that was and is not their intent.
---
so those other 5 clowns farm monthly AT..... k.
---
The biggest pain will be unlocking all of the S3, PoF and S4 maps again. Otherwise all the good stuff is account wide so as long as you dont stupidly delete something that you bought from the gem store you'll be fine.
---
My goal is never to hit the benchmark, is to do as much dps as the other DPSers in the group, or being the top dps. That's enough even if we all do just 20k.
---
Kyle Landry did a really fine job with Fear Not This Night (to this day my prefered piano transcription of a GW2 OST), I think the music sheet is not free, but definitely worth a shot (requires a good level in piano, I, as a beginner, have a bad time)
---
We had decent wvw streams in the past. Moved on to diff games.
---
We had quite a few top end pvp streams in the past. Most moved on to diff games.
---
We still have tpot. I'd watch but there isnt any new content worth watching.
---
Paying big streamers isnt free either. No big streamer will bother with gw2 in its present state, especially not longer than a week.
---
Unless they're paid to. But as you outlined that isnt really sustainable. The grass roots way is better.
---
Have you tried the golem in the training area?
---
I think that content is the perfect difficulty for someone like you who doesn't want to play the game.
---
Yes, but in some sense, watchable modes are not independent of the type of game. An MMO is defined by a massive amount of players. I'm not talking 6, 10, or even the ~150- per map for WvW, but lots, lots more. Surely you can have niches within such a game where such a limitation works, and we see that in GW2 as well, but those are not the "core" of the game (type). If GW2 would concentrate on PvP, raids or WvW alone, it wouldn't be an MMO anymore. That's not to say those modes are not important, just that the "core" parts of an MMO are rather uninteresting to watch, even if they are (not to everyone) incredibly interesting to actively play.
---
And all the dragons and the god somehow bent over as an asura spit a few fireballs in their direction. And they're pretty tiny fireballs nowadays.
---
30 minutes of crying and meaningless dialogue about strong dangerous opponent that will destroy Tyria REEEEEEEEEEE.
---
Less than 5 minutes of auto attacking that stronk dangerous opponent to death, often solo.
---
At least we can always use taimi as our deus ex machina solution for anything our casual players cant solve.
---
Great storytelling such immersion.
---
So easy its impossible to fail is not enjoyable to many.
---
You may want to report this to ANet. Is this something that only happened recently? They are able to build the main executable as 64 bit, so maybe they could do the same for that one, too. They most likely just didn't notice because my guess is that Windows has to keep all that legacy stuff around in order to not stumble over its own feet: maybe there is not yet something like a pure 64 bit Windows system.
---
I currently have 3 months off and I was looking for a game to grind. A guy i met in my classes suggested gw2 and introduced me to your site to help me start working towards acsended gear and maxing my crafting professions. Now i have gw2 efficiency open on my second monitor whenever I'm in game :) 
---
Its honestly the most amazing tool for a new player like me and vets alike.
---
But but people are leaving how dare they to get new people? The game is dying! /s  
---
I'm happy to see new people joining anet and hope she has a great time :)
---
Norn Dragonhunter, mb?
---
&gt; I cannot believe that Raids and Fractals died for this.
---
I don't think they died to make Strikes, I think they were dead anyway after the layoffs and this is Anet trying to put in *something*. The fact that this is Episode 1 but it's half the size of the prologue makes it pretty clear resources are running dry and Anet is scrambling to get content out the door. For those who have been around long enough it probably feels eerily familiar to Season 2, which wasn't *bad*, but had fairly short story instances coupled with a small, expanding map while the rest of the studio tried to get HoT made. Honestly wouldn't be surprised if there is actually another expac on the eventual horizon, but more of a "players are exceptionally unhappy unless we switch gears into an expac" like HoT, and less like PoF which was pretty clearly planned.
---
I was about to say "as long as you don't pvp, you'll love this game" but then I did read your post lol.
---
He's lost the mat right before tol in a humiliating fashion while rerolling to double rev which was absolutely broken at a time. then he's won the tol because the dominating team had to play with 2 subs due to unavailability.
---
Here's link to refresh your memory
---
[https://youtu.be/wRJzOQJqT9k?t=2451](https://youtu.be/wRJzOQJqT9k?t=2451)
---
People believe the game is dying for 7 years. So they quit... and then they come back 1-2 years later and I'm like "hey dude, you're back". I can't tell you how many times this has happened in my guild haha.  
---
The game is pretty much alive and I bet it will still be.
---
When it comes to creators- artists, sound design, creative concepts, Anet really does pick up the best. I hope we're getting some great new visions with her hiring.
---
If you are in silver or low gold you're making mayor mistakes in either rotations or mechanics, likely both. You shouldn't have issues climbing as you improve.
---
Both. The advice fails because it misses the point: the OP wants to run the 64-bit version of GW2 on a pure 64-bit system. Those are the requirements. Running on a mixed system does work, but does not fit the requirements. And the pure 64-bit approach fails because apparently, while ANet provides a 64-bit main binary, it is coupled to a 32-bit binary, creating a "mixed bundle", which a pure 64 bit system cannot run.
---
That is because pve isnt allowed to have real counter pressure. Else the casuals tear up.
---
You can have archetypes in pvp and wvw if you get proper balance. You can have them in pve with newly designed pve encounters.
---
But as long as everything is a trivial dps sponge, at best with a few mechanics, you will continue to see this.
---
while i love the idea, that sounds too hard for the maintarget of strikes
---
S3 and PoF/S4 have the dalies maps and mounts. S2 is really just set up for HoT. RIBA remains a reliable farm and you can just stroll in at any time.
---
You're convoluting rich and diverse with trivial. Gw2 openworld allows diversity despite being terribly balanced because it is trivial.
---
Any challenging content that attempts this requires balance. The result is much better as you get actual diversity, that is to say genuine options that dont kneecap the user. Not make believe options where you handicap yourself but it's fine because you play content designed to be impossible to fail.
---
Season 4 is also a GREAT story that flows right after you finish PoF so if you played PoF then you just keep right on going and it’s an epic play though if you don’t have to wait for the release dates (so you get the play the full living story as if it was its own game at your own pace.. you don’t have to wait for 2mo for each episode to arrive haha).
---
Enjoy it and enjoy your beetle! (Sky scale is really endgame and is an unnecessary mount so it’s up to you if you want to farm for it or not).
---
1mn before instance close: Hah! Sike! It is I, the skinboner! 
---
Guess Kralky wasn't the only one to play dead...
---
To play pvp in BDO you are late to the party. You can catch up, and it definitely has catch up mechanics.
---
But itll cost you time and cash to grind and p2w utilities.
---
Jenn is an artist something GW2 manifestly does not need and doesn;t replace any of teh devs who have left.
---
you can never get a equal replacement for a veteran dev, but you also can't keep them from leaving. People now a days don't work all there life in one company any more, they want to try new things, learn new things, experience new things. Maybe for many of those who are leaving the new thing was the not know project of anet, now that this is gone they don't want to work on gw2 any more because they want new things.
---
All of these are accurate and doable in wvw, pvp and raids.
---
how do you know that the old devs did not get replaced? Just because every new person is announced on twitter does not mean no one is joining
---
Okay thanks, but all characters on the account can share things like gliding and mounts as soon as they're unlocked, right?
---
I think it would be better if they gave the option to share story across the whole account. I really don't like the idea of playing through the same story arcs and skipping the same cut scenes over and over again to get the rewards. 
---
Is mastery account wide or per character as well?
---
I'm sorry but this is painful to read.
---
Modern competitive games are designed so that there is competition for players of all skill levels. This is done through dynamic matchmaking, survival games, various difficulty levels. This makes competition fun for hardcore and casual players as they play at their own skill level and both have a chance at winning.
---
If you bring about a cs 1.5 era shooter with lobbies, no matchmaking, free swapping sides, no balanced teams of course its doomed to fail. Its 20 years behind every other competitive genre. It's not fun for hardcore to pubstomp noobs. It's not fun for casual to get pub stomped. It's not competition if people leave the lobby after round 3.
---
Gw2 Pvp launched without matchmaking, without grouping evenly skilled players, without leaderboard, without any design for competitive gameplay. 
---
Gw2 wvw the exact same. It allows players to swap sides freely, later exchanged for swapping for cash. This means it loses interest of most competitive players (that started grass roots gvg competition instead.) Yet casual players dont enjoy pvp centred around farming them either.
---
This is exactly why mmorpgs lost so many players to other genres. They're a decade behind when it comes to competitive games.
---
artists are way more present in media than most of devs in any company cause that's a part of our job  
---
I have no doubts anet found some new devs already, new isn't always worse
---
ls4 &gt; ls3
---
Pretty sure he was sarcastic...
---
The audience left because of negligence and incompetence.
---
Cant blame them!
---
Jenn's one of my favourite artists in MTG at the moment. This is rad.
---
We know about her because of a tweet; that doesn't mean ANet aren't hiring actual programmers.
---
Unpopular opinion, competitive players left mmorpgs because they're full to the brink with uncompetitive features often to please the carebears that hate actual competition.
---
This is one of the reasons mmorpgs lost their market share. They no longer have a diverse audience. It's only people that want immersion remaining.
---
Meanwhile the competitive market is 10x the size of mmorpgs. And the casual mobile market is far bigger still.
---
Mmorpgs arent worth making, especially from scratch, for whatever remains. Too expensive and risky.
---
the game has too many artists and too few programmers.
---
imo same goes for their social media and marketing, no offense but most ppl dont give a shit about some artist making pretty concept art - instead focus on content creators that actually play the game and sponsor some new ones to show the game to wider audience
---
He is comparing to pvp games. Zelda is widely popular but doesnt come near the success of certain pvp games.
---
No, the audience was never there. The developers just eventually stopped trying to make fetch happen.
---

---
It's a considerable discount. 20% off each chapter.
---
It's sometimes under a much higher discount, like during the latest  Anniversary Sale.
---
Since start of the game people was complaining about slow pace adding a new content. And now the people responsible for that are leaving the company. What wrong with you guys?
---
Cause they are toxic selfish carebears. As people are starting to realise that this sub has become a whole lot more fun and dynamic.
---
Sylvari tempest/weaver maybe?
---
Great work!
---
I don't have a necromancer but you seem to have captured everything in this picture, even the symbols on the floor!
---
It will teach them to bring a different build which is a huge thing for getting into raids. More damage would still require a healer, regardless of how you buff it.
---
What is red cardinal doing there?
---
[We already had that conversation.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/e25mkp/the_new_strike_missions_are_the_better_raids/f8tqf71/) You noped out once you would've had to stop your discourse manipulation to proceed. You're welcome to pick up where we left it. All it takes is stop the loaded questions, implications and allegations.
---
10 years later league only has 5v5 on SR and it appeals to hundreds to thousands times more players than gw2.
---
Doing the same thing over and over with balance and some innovation to diversify works well. 
---
Pve on the other hand needs constant content updates or it runs dry.
---
That's how they should do alliances and wvw. Let alliances be groups of guilds. No joining as solo pug. No leeches.
---
It's a bird, what's there to fix?
---
The audience left within the first months when it was clear pvp and wvw were 10 years behind competitive games and pve literally had no endgame except dungeons... where only arah was difficult.
---
Gw2 has been a largely irrelevant game since. It got more investments but it never managed to really grow.
---
Now we just need sets of 2 2v2 and 10v10 mini-tournaments between the 5v5 ones.
---
Repeatable and chill doesn't mean the content can't be engaging, Anet struggle to do this however.
---
Often, a lot of the contents l they release insults my intelligence and physical capabilities, even as a casual player, to the point where it feels like selling a children's program to adults.
---
Correct, mastery unlocks are permanent and account wide including gliding and mounts. Mastery points are all unlocked through one time achievements, you can't unlock the same mastery point more than once (and a few in the personal story unlock the same point for different options and don't give extra points once you get one of them). You don't really need to play story on other characters besides a few cases: story choice in PoF leads to one of 3 choices with Amnoon, personal story has vastly different starting story at levels 10 and 20, some story changes based on race (Sylvari get slight changes in HoT for instance). Whatever character you play through the story on can replay older sections to get missed achievements or try different options (though again like with the PoF story some choices are lasting for that play through). Also you'd only really play though a lot of the story for extra rewards or if you wanted to, for most people once is enough.
---
There are officially approved 3rd party retailers. These are fine.
---
I expect bunch of artworks of Marjory Delaqua. :D
---
"Gw2 is a 5 star steak house selling crisps"
---
Originally the game was a lot more engaging, up until season 3.
---
Why are you comparing it to raids? I'm talking about engaging casual single player/co-op games (donuts in your analogy) and gw2 still fails to deliver as an engaging experience as them. I can't think of a game less engaging than gw2 where you can literally ignore 90% of the gameplay and systems (pressing 1) to complete nearly everything.
---
Also, every company has that issue with player skill. You teach them through a tutorial, add difficulty settings (most single player games), or force them to just get good. It is an issue Abet created.
---
&gt; who would love their fucking DHs to volunteer for Sab cannons for once
---
Ok, I LOL'ed. I admit it.
---
Doesn't look very good
---
Thank you , i don't have a necro neither, but I tried to put everything in one drawing, :-)
---
My point has and will always be 80% benchmark is perfectly fine. Bitching about the difference from 80-90% and arguing over a 3k dps increase is like bitchibg over if 3 or 4 squares of TP is best. They both get the job done and do it perfectly fine. You can know your rotation down to the millisecond and hit 90% always it's still negligible. I did the math on it even, it's the difference of 179k vs 193k party wide dps which on both teams is quite good. If you are going for speed runs and records that's not good, hell 90% is trash but at most you are shaving 15-20 seconds off the fight at best.
---
Probably because of the megaserver system they have. There's always going to be people on any map, because there's bound to be at least ~50-100 people in the whole of Europe or North America that want to berry farm in Bitterfrost or do some achievements in Grothmar Valley. It can give the illusion that the game is "alive", but there is a possibility that the 20 people you see in Queensdale are the *only* 20 people in the whole North American/European continent that are in Queensdale.
---
I have multiple sets of ascended gear, and a couple of raid boss kills as well. However even with 1-2 h per day I cant bring myself into spending all playtime training to kill a boss, and then grind the way up to get 250LI to be allowed into lfg groups packed with elitist unemployed shitheads
---
Strike mission public mode is full cancer. Low dps, little to no support and people go down all the time. They could scale the boss, reduce the number of players to max of 5. Most people in the game don't even care for raids, imagine strike missions where the reward is even worse and where there is no need to complete to get PVE legendary armor.
---
Pepehands
---
Although I'm always excited if Anet can bring in someone new and talented, I'd debate your statment. The game needs first and foremost gameplay designers who can incentivize Group content and add new ideas to it.
---
Burb
---
You seem to assume all the vets are "toxic" and all the casuals are "friendly", which is an absurd statement to make. I can personally look through my post history and find hundreds of "toxic casuals" that needlessly insult me like toddlers for wanting raids back.
---
Is this the beginning of a theme with Anet's hiring? Should we expect artists named Jane Wolfena, Maya Ursa, or Kate Snowleoparda as the next Icebrood Saga chapters roll out?
---
This game is evidence that "casual" doesn't make you friendly. Toxic casuals is not a term I've used often in many other games besides gw2, the community that pats itself on the back for letting you play how you want, but the moment you suggest a challenge is needed, you are told to, and I quote a reddit comment, "fuck off to toxic raiding games like ff14" :)
---
And yes you are right, players not rarely at either extreme ends, but your comment kinda proves how ironically toxic people treat others for playing "elitist content".
---
I was talking about the extremes, which you represent one of them right now being toxic and jerking other vets off.
---
The game developent understander has logged on lmao
---
I wasn't toxic to you because you play "elitist content". I was toxic because you are toxic right now and complain about others when they respond in kind.
---
Just out of curiosity, what do you main?
---
Artists fill multiple roles. They design environments, etc. The person commenting might feel the world, armour and general aesthetics need upgrading an an artist is absolutely where you start with that.
---
And again, that are the Big Problems our Game has.. you got it
---
take my money
---
need more misleading gemstore art
---
Gw2 is on the chinese market locally. There were a few Korean guilds on EU and NA. You go "big old franchise!!!" as if gw2 isnt a sequel part of a franchise. 
---
You claimed it's one of the bigger mmorpgs. Then it became a top western mmorpg. Top 5 also went out the window. 
---
You say numbers arent available. Partly true, as for some games asian numbers are included. (Likely also true for gw2 and china, but hey asian market is unfair!). But the numbers we have are typically atleast 5 times larger than those for gw2, often way way more than that.
---
I.e. jagex revenue is going up to 120m dollar. You think there is any way rs is below gw2?
---
Ffxiv is on 620m $ for Q3 2019. Including asian market.
---
Wow is obviously above gw2. No numbers for wow alone yet I wont even doubt.
---
No suprise this game is basically in maintenance mode. It's pretty much dead compared to active mmorpgs.
---
Thanks. This should be higher up
---
Again, stop being full of shit.
---
The game doesn't teach you how to breakbar, doesn't mean you shouldn't CC the boss.
---
The players "abusing unintended game mechanics to feel better about themselves at the expense of other players who cannot possibly know about these exploits because the game doesn't teach them in any way." are litterally paying to host a website they wrote to tell people how to perform those tricks.
---
The positioning trick (DH standing inside the hitbox) is accessible to litterally everyone watching what their character is doing when they press the button. It is currently performed on absolutely all bosses where power DPS are used (dunno about CA). If walking inside the hitbox, or into the optimal range of your skills is "highly optimized and organised", you might want to reconsider what you call "optimized". 
---
As for boons, they are displayed inside the video. If you tried to learn the rotation without either reading the guide or watching the video, and done that long enough to get butthurt about it  well, you can only be so dumb. 
---
So baseline is, you're getting mad about people using game mechanics (like it or not, if it's doable in game withiut cheats, it can be used) to optimize their play, telling people how they do it in detail, then making a website dedicated to teaching people how to execute, complete with guides and videos. All that because you think it's not the way the game should be played. Can't wait to see your next thread on how people shouldn't jump dodge because you don't think it's very RP.
---
Again, it sounds like your attitude is the problem. I wouldn't want to raid with you either.
---
Skinboner sounds kinda awkwark :|
---
She looks more like a Belinda to me 🧐
---
Bots have better rating than most players. I'm certain bots would farm your ass. 
---
Pvp is for youngsters after all. Older people with no time ruining their experience so they can get easy gear is no issue at all!
---
I know anet doesnt ban for it. But this community being in favour of ruining pvp for everyone because certain players want to abuse ranked as their afk farm and csmt even be bothered playing at all is toxic. This type of toxic behavior is why this game is as controversial here ;)
---
Giving AP to anything with daily rotation is shit design. It renders AP meaningless. AP is rewarded for doing an achievement, not grinding same thing each day for some illusionary points which mean nothing nor reward nothing meaningless at the end. In GW2, if you see someone with high AP, you dont know, if they just logged in each day, do some boring 5 min tasks, or they really accomplished many achievements. Especially for new players, they will never be able to have AP on par with vets, because it is time gated and does not reflect permanent achievements done. Just shit design and disincentivization for new players.
---
You're making the continuous mistake that I want hardcore content and that engaging=hardcore/challenging. I repeatedly told you this is not the issue. My point was that as a chill experience, GW2 fails in the gameplay/story aspect compared to most other casual games. It is an Extreme niche that even goes against its original design philosophies as a skill based and PvP game.
---
Sure, appealing to the lowest common denominator is "popular" but it results in shallow games and should not be defended imo.
---
Also, you seem to narrow down to specific things I said and ignore all the prior and post context.
---
No point engaging further in this discussion.
---
You don't need S2 for RIBA though. The maps are core.
---
Not sure if you were implying you need S2 for it or not, but said it anyway.
---
As for OP's question, both offer a ton of value so you should get both eventually, but I'd go with S4 first, if you don't care about playing the story in order.
---
They should make lighting the torches more relevant.
---
Nevermind that, you literally have AP that is impossible to attain for new players due to limited activities that are not coming back .. AP in this game could be a meaningful thing but nope, is totally botched.
---
Yeah, screw players who have been here since release. Scum.
---
Tbh I have never hit gold with pugs with Fraenir. ANet must have seen the same stats internally with most pugs and completely and finally realized just how untalented/lazy/inept/bad their casual player base is.
---
[Untitled Goose Game](https://goose.game/)
---
&gt; the thread you're referencing where people complained that a coder experienced in optimsation and code management was hired
---
There are front-end people and there are back-end people. Artists tend to be the former, they face the community, have public portfolios and communicate on social media - including making posts about getting hired. Coders tend not to do all those things and be even less known than [artists](https://pics.me.me/before-and-after-fame-actors-musicians-artists-soioh-andersm-27381954.png), so people who stalk devs on social media in this sub won't even know if a great coder were to be hired unless ANet specifically told us.
---
&gt; instead of Anet working on their marketing projects?
---
You are misinterpreting what I wrote.
---
4 Restored Weapons for the mastery point, as you get the first point of credit in that achievement for free basically on entering the zone and receiving/reading mail.
---
I stopped seeing GW2 as a core gamer experience with the NPE. Or all the dungeon nerfs. The Orr nerf. Everything, really. And I loved the original concept of huge open world content where you're part of a mass of over players, highly social, extremely immersive. A fuckzillion of other games do the WoW clone polonaise, I can't tell you how tired I am of that shit.
---
Lucky me I find GW2 quite engaging, else I would not just play other games for a more challenging experience, I would also play other games for a more engaging experience as well.
---
One of the reason why I love the low-difficulty Strikes so much. They're the only kind of repeatable content in the game right now.
---
&gt;but said it anyway
---
No.
---
&gt;RIBA remains a reliable farm and **you can just stroll in at any time**
---
I wish there would be class storylines, with customization (no commander bs). I like the reaper look, nice painting.
---
what isn't depressingly easy in gw2 :)
---
Tbh I also didn't hit gold every day with pugs on Fraenir but I love aiming for it. Felt like a nice challenge.
---
did i say that? because i didn't. i wrote a n d.
---
it's about providing something fresh and challenging. the alpine border maps are acutally not a bit better to fight on than EBG or desert. there is mainly a bit more open, even space, but if you look where the engages happen, it's often just around keeps or on the uneven grounded (which is a horrible place to engage) areas.
---
does it have to do anything better? who rates the wvw maps, some salty pve'ers who got ganked at their first sightseeing tours in wvw? :P
---
we'd just need more people to fill the maps, as for now mostly everything focuses on EBG outside of weekends. bc the losing factions concentrate their forces on holding stonemist. could be fixed by just making a 3-way link of the servers. i think its not as bad as in NA, but even t1 EU could profit from still more players. the alpine borders are outside of weekends equally lacking bigger numbers as the desert, ergo rarely more than one zerg per color in tier1 matchups.
---
&gt; Again, stop being full of shit.
---
Not a great way to begin your argument.
---
&gt; The game doesn't teach you how to breakbar, doesn't mean you shouldn't CC the boss.
---
I don't see anyone asking for a weapon stow tutorial. Probably because they would be laughed out of reddit and forums for suggesting that.
---
&gt; are litterally paying to host a website they wrote to tell people how to perform those tricks
---
First of, I was referring to everyone who's abusing weapon stow to boost their dps, not just SC members.
---
Secondly, SC did start writing about some stowing opportunities recently, but it wasn't the case for a long time, they don't explain how and when exactly to do that (because it's not common knowledge, you see), and I'd bet my ass they're using it way more than they're saying in rotation descriptions. But you can never be sure, because you can not see that on the videos, because IT'S AN UNINTENDED MECHANIC.
---
&gt; DH standing inside the hitbox
---
Well, that's the only one you know about. Ye olde PS Warrior GS 3 would like to have a word with you, that shit was dependent not even just on positioning, but on network conditions too.
---
&gt; As for boons, they are displayed inside the video
---
Just as I stated in my original post.
---
&gt; So baseline is
---
"bottom line"
---
Now you're getting mad about me complaining about people abusing game mechanics and trying to get others to do the same, all because they think that's the way the game should be played. I too can play this game of yours, you see.
---
I dont think this is honest. Obviously you can get high level and reasonable gear score quickly, quicker than people that played from the start. But getting past that softcap to compete with those with a head start will take you months and a lot of money before you come even close.
---
You can get a lot of convenience for free if you play consistently.
---
But if you want to start playing and grind to competitive, you need 4 pets. Buy them and grind, or get them through dailies but take several months. And perhaps some extra storage. And some outfits that boost stats. Perhaps some maids too. 
---
And you need to grind some dailies for that energy and node.
---
And get base gear so you can start grinding efficiently. Then you grind, which isnt too difficult...until you get near the high end grind spots. Those are contested, and you cant contest them yet.
---
Getting to a level where you have some AP isnt difficult. But you're also cannon fodder for pvp, and not in any way competitive.
---
Similar for life skilling. At release I was able to turn profit from leveling processing and alchemy the entire way up. Many people who were behind had to invest because higher skilled people did the same recipes with better results... and dump their products too.
---
He did what he had to do
---
nice but this is necro farm afk build and should be banned
---
That, soldier, is a threat!
---
I'm with you there, OP!
---
&gt; When before HoT I first heard about a whole "jungle expansion", I got immediately worried about the whole several next years of the game being the same jungle, jungle and jungle (despite jungles being my second favourite environment theme). But luckily, the 4 maps felt diverse enough, and the Living World maps that got added later took us accross the whole world, with new settings and new different enemies!
---
&gt; I can agree, to an extent, with the arguments that LWs3 story felt disjointed, but honestly, to me the variety in experience that it brought was superior to the self-contained nature of LWs4. Sadly, with PoF and its Living World, I feel like for many months now we've been travelling across the same damn beige semi-deserts, with the same damn zombies and the same dame midget scientists (and zombie midget scientists) in the same damn brown architecture. I do like virtual sand that doesn't get anywhere, but not in these quantities and shades, okay?..
---
&gt; By now, I really miss different biomes; the in-map variety, IMO, just doesn't cut it anymore for this expansion, and I do hope we finally move somewhere else for a change of scenery.
---
Season 3 was like fractals.
---
I agree there was a lot more to do in S3 than S4 (Especially since LLTL blew by with lightning speed) 
---
But as someone else said the S3 story did feel like it was killing time until it needed to promote PoF.
---
Are you? Do you feel attacked? The veterans' white knight is here?
---
Are you familiar with "ad hominem" arguments?
---
As a suggestion, after you delete your account with Anet (good move), either continue therapy or find a support group for addiction.  Like any addiction, you don't want to relapse again.
---
Therapy can be expensive to do continously, that's where support groups come in great.  Don't stop going to those either.  Even when you think you are "cured".  If you feel you really are all good, still go and think how you can help others there while continuing to get some support yourself.
---
Finally, I'm glad you recognize this and are doing something about it.  I think a number of players have issues with this with different amount of degrees.  And most don't recognize it.  So congrats :)
---
Yes.
---
At some point it might be more efficient to do a new game than to fix old spaghetti.
---
/u/Anet-Clayton any chance you can give us some infos about this please?
---
Mechanically, LWS4 was great. Other than new elite specializations, it included an amount of content I would easily consider to be worth a small expansion. Story wise, I found it to be more disjointed than LWS3.
---
On the the opposite side, I think LWS3 had a more coherent story, even if it did bounce around a lot. Quite a bit lighter on what I would consider content, mechanically.
---
Opinions! Gotta have 'em, (wo)man!
---
The community that downvotes even PvP tournament announcements, calls raids ruining "their" game and berates Arenanet for sharing Snowcrows benchmark videos on twitter. Just a few road marks in a 7 year period. Sure thing dude.
---
You continue to chastise "veterans", which again goes against your statement about how people are usually not in either extreme definitions, and constantly use "jerk off" to dismiss other voices. Ultimately it's just an animosity that won't be resolved here, you do you I guess.
---
What do you do when they repeat the same mistakes for a new game; spaghetti code in the new game.
---
TLDR: Big Brain
---
You're an afker (considered griefing in most competitive games) and you defend it by saying "haha none plays it". Yet this very thread states that none plays it because this behavior is so common. But you dont care about anyone but yourself.
---
Which is interesting because you REEEEE alot about people not being positive enough about the game. 
---
Next time you're upset people arent positive about gw2 and your preferred casual content, remember you're toxic to anyone that doesnt play like you. Them being annoyed might have something to do with that.
---
In fact, by refusing to empathise with other players you'll probably fuel more toxicity both here and ingame. I'll happily help you with that mission!
---
I agree that it was truly unfocused, maybe even a bit better because of that. We got to see different parts of the world and how they dealt with the aftermath. What was going on in Kryta and it's politics? What was the situation in the Shiverpeaks and how were the Norn dealing with the Sons of Svanir? I think Season 3 was one thing we solely needed after Season 2 and HoT (after strongly focused stories) in a way where we kinda slow down and check what is happening in the world.
---
start with rev.  =) its not bad
---
Please do norn berserker girl "viking" style!
---
&gt;complaining about Anet getting more devs as if its a bad thing 
---
I personally wouldn't consider concept artists as "devs"... Arenanet has always had great concept art, but that's meaningless to the actual gameplay.
---
The complaining isnt about us disliking artists... it's due to the recognition that Anet has a limited budget and can only employ a limited numberof staff, and we'd PREFER if that money was spent to employ gameplay oriented developers instead. People that can fix the coding and add interesting mechanics.
---
As it stands, this feels like more money being mismanaged and utilized poorly. Something Anet has had a habit of doing since its inception.
---
TLDR: Anet doesn't have an infinite pool of cash to hire infinite employees. There's better things to spend it on.
---
Please stop talking about how you're old, mature and dont have time for anything.
---
You're just projecting. More old people play league, fortnite and cod than gw2. You dont speak for all the "old people" and they definitely arent all as carebear.
---
Maybe people won't like this being pointed out but like with everything in the new map its likely to be expanded into the drakkar boss fight so I'm holding back judgement to episode 2.
---
thanks everyone. in my case, the left handed keypad solve my problems with the story actions in instances that mentioned in my post. my ultimate tip with the options still stands if there is a worst case situation.
---
make your own group ?
---
have you tried making a group yourself?
---
And why is it not the best build available for Power Revenant??? Sure, Power Herald might not be the highest dps but at least it give boon where half of support classes that are support to give them didnt do.
---
With less experience players, I even found Herald healer more effective than Ren healer. Even with the lack of Alacrity, the overall boon is just better and overall dps is better. Sometime the best buid available for the situation is not the build of the META.
---
Because all of this doesn't matter regarding the observation that there's a 32bit binary where imho a 64bit one should be. See the answer from foromar above :)
---
I've tried doing that several times but barely anyone joins. Guessing they expect some kind of KP that just isn't written in the description of it mentions challenge mote
---
Since players can own half of the map, they will likely be two separate metas.
---
Have to check when I played the last time and if my system was already 64bit only by that point. Reporting to ANet will be done afterwards.
---
Send an email to the ceo of the company, explain your addiction. You'll be considered a vulnerable customer.
---
ceoemail.com
---
People complaining are most likely not those buying gems.
---
Anet are game developers and have shit so much on this game its in maintenance mode now.
---
&gt; Gw2 is on the chinese market locally.
---
Yes, but those profits aren't factored into their totals because like most Chinese joint ventures, the Chinese version is disconnected from ANet and NCSoft. 
---
&gt;There were a few Korean guilds on EU and NA. You go "big old franchise!!!" as if gw2 isnt a sequel part of a franchise. 
---
It's not officially launched in Korea though, so it does not benefit from full access to that market. 
---
&gt;You go "big old franchise!!!" as if gw2 isnt a sequel part of a franchise. 
---
It's not. Most current GW2 players had never heard of "Guild Wars" prior to GW2's launch. Are you trying to claim that the Guild Wars brand in 2012 was on the same tier as Star Wars or Final Fantasy?
---
&gt;You claimed it's one of the bigger mmorpgs. Then it became a top western mmorpg. Top 5 also went out the window. 
---
I stand by my position as I'd originally intended it. I'm sorry if you were confused as to my context. As a westerner on an English speaking discussion forum, I was speaking from a western-centric position. I was not even considering Korean clicker-games. 
---
&gt;Ffxiv is on 620m $ for Q3 2019. Including asian market.
---
&gt;Wow is obviously above gw2. No numbers for wow alone yet I wont even doubt.
---
WoW's population has been in freefall for years now, it's not a good idea to assume anything. Also, both FF15 and WoW are subscription games based on strong brands, I expect them to do better than an indy game like GW2. We're discussing whether GW2 is "failing," whether it's punching below what should be expected of it. I see no evidence of that. What I see is a game that is making as much revenue in 2019 as it was in 2016 and 2014, basically remaining stable in an industry where most games fall off a cliff fairly quickly. It's estimated to be in 5th place among western MMO's active populations, just behind ESO and ahead of Runescape. They just released two story updates, for a total of five this year alone. That is hardly "maintenance mode."  That you would claim it shows an ignorance to what "maintenance mode" even means.
---
&gt;No suprise this game is basically in maintenance mode. It's pretty much dead compared to active mmorpgs.
---
Evidence?
---
Well, if I recall correctly, it's Chromium. If that has a 64bit version, maybe it can be replaced?
---
You write the code in modern standards. 7 years later, after you learn tons more about the language and new tech emerges, you look back and smack yourself for how you did it the first time, and wonder how it even worked in the first place.
---
1) Daily CM's are a chore so having to teach one person adds a lot of unnecessary time people aren't willing to spend. The difference between a smooth run and not can be up to 1hr difference so you can't really blame people for wanting exp people only.
---
2) Make own training group at peak times, like I and many others did, and once you know ur role perfectly ask higher KP reqs in your own party.
---
Saying you can't do content because KP limits you is just shifting the responsibility. Everyone has the same road to take and it all depends on your own skill and dedication.
---
\[&amp;AvpPPwEA\]
---
code for 250 KP, just use this as your ticket and run with them.
---
as i said a thousand times i  do no tplay pvp anymore . when i played i did to get the wings so i needed to win. when i got the wings i stopped cause there was no other reason to do it.
---
so no, i 'm not a afkers. i was just saying it is common and explaining you why.
---
i'm not toxic to anyone. i was just saying that many ppl in bronze 3 play this was and i was explining you why they do so aand, form a noob point of view , is the wiser thing to do toxic or not.
---
i fuel nothing i game. as i stated thousand time to me this is a single player game
---
just go raid
---
&gt; Next time you're upset people arent positive about gw2 and your preferred casual content, remember you're toxic to anyone that doesnt play like you. Them being annoyed might have something to do with that.
---
&gt; 
---
adnd the the 1000000 times i do not afk in pvp. i do not even enter in pvp anymore. can you read ? i just said this is why ppl go afk in pvp and they are not to blame for this.
---
Which is why people will also ask for the title.  And just for reference, I've asked people to split the 250 in 4 specific numbers and it's always funny to see them link a number, that when added up, goes way over 250.  But people like you are super easy to pick out within the first 33% of the first boss
---
Oh don't leave me with blue balls here
---
before it occurred to me that the shrines were nothing but claim circles i thought their initial idea was that each lane get a different kind of bomber that is weak to that lanes main enemies, so people get a chance to get more used to the mastery. it just feels rushed and completely unfinished and pointless in its current state, and not in a way that could be expanded upon with the next ~~episode~~ half of the episode. doesn't help that the main "reward" is access to 4 champs with (still buggy) bounty mechanics and a hand full of underwhelming and daily gated chests 🤷‍♀️
---
Unfortunately this is one of those metas where you don't have to participate to get rewards. You can go to a shrine, hit a mob, and wait for the time to run out. If memory serves, mobs don't even give experience, and as you mentioned, they don't drop anything, which just exacerbates the length of the meta, doesn't give you any reason to engage the enemies, and the shrines don't take damage consistently, and when they do, I think they even regenerate their health.
---
After that you can just mount up, do an engage skill on the ice crystals and move to the next to get 3 reward chests which contains the things you want.
---
Remember in HoT where you had a participation bar you'd fill by completing events and it'd scale the rewards you received at the end? If we had a progression chest like that for this meta, it'd play very differently.
---
Imagine if you had a chance of getting a restored weapon from said progression chest if you had 100% + participation, like in Dragon Strand, or if the experience you received at the end scaled up.
---
Coming into the map as a fresh, no masteries player, what I wanted out of everything in the map was experience, the ingots and the eternal ice. Currently the meta only gives you 2 things, the experience and the ice, and it's a reward that does not scale with your participation, you can afk and get all rewards, and if you actively participate, you aren't rewarded for it.
---
I *really* doubt they'll improve the meta in the next episode, there is always an optimistic chance that they'll change the way the map/masteries/episodes are delivered to the player that are late to the party.
---
I am hoping that they'll just give you the previous episodes of the saga, because otherwise they'll just straight up split the map into different chunks, and they can buzzword us into death with 'expanding' map each episode as much as they want, but it's just a 'new map' for that one season, with chunks that are just not accessible, and if the previous map is not accessible, how are they going to integrate the 3rd tier of mastery into the existing unlocking system. Are players just going to go into the 2nd chunk of the map and have it unlocked? Will they have to play another intro scene where they re-explain the mastery of raven and stuff? Because if so, the first interaction with the raven mastery to unlock the door just becomes useless fluff.
---
I'd like to compare this issue with the Sun Spear refuge expansion/evolution thing. People were thinking that players would be expanding it with every release, which did not happen except with the Skyscale release, which is a bit of a special case, since you are required to have all maps to have it, and it comes at the very end of the entire storyline.
---
If ArenaNet were to expand Sun spear refuge in different living world episodes, I can guarantee you that people would be complaining every single episode that expanded the refuge with 'I have to unlock the previous episode to access the content of the current episode' (which if you remember, was the exact thing that happened with the Skyscale).
---
This issue comes with the way the game is divided into 'free if you play' content updates that you are required to pay if you ended up skipping them. Sure, it may bring some extra $$$ to Anet, but it cripples their ability to change things in the previous episode with the new one, and now, if they keep with the same formula as before, will create complexity on how players will be interacting with the saga.
---
If I am a new player and I get the 2nd episode now. without having the first, how are things going to work for me?
---
I am rambling again, and going off topic, but these things are the questions that keep piling up and not even Anet probably knows, so they'll just stumble drunk down the staircase and saying how 'exciting' everything is when they're at the bottom.
---
And that's why I run Arcdps and see how you perform. At first boss, I will have enough information about your experience. But I'm not the type of guys that will kick without warning or talking.
---
I will just point the problem if low Dps, Boons, Support, etc... Than we could try to fix the problem togheter and if you are not experience enough to lift your weigth than sorry for you, we might not carry you if we are in a bad day (I always do witg friends/guildies and with pugs for the last one a lot of time).
---
That's why I no longer ask for Kp but only for Exp players and I do my one mind about them. Those that ask for Kp anyway are people that want to be  carry, lazy people or people that follow META like it was religion.
---
&gt; Guessing they expect some kind of KP that just isn't written in the description if it mentions challenge mote
---
You could explicitly mention "no KP required" to exclude that possibility. You will have the problem that then most likely only those without a lot of experience will join, but that's always the problem: those who are experienced are rarely willing to spend the time to teach, likely because of bad examples of players not willing to learn. 
---
It's a circle. It's the same with T3 fractals. It's not hell to get through because it is more difficult than T2. The biggest problem is that it is hard to find players, and those that you do find are barely T3 themselves, so they are not experienced. Would they be better, they would not play T3, but T4. You will hardly find T4 or CM players play within the T3 category, except for the recommended dailies, and lots of those groups are advertised in the T4 lfg, not lower, for a reason.
---
I was explaining you a different point of view.
---
One where griefing competitive players for trying to compete in ranked pvp isnt "friendly" or "positive" but actively ruins their enjoyment for the game.
---
But you laughed and considered them too few. Clearly you not having to die much or getting easy gear is more important than other people being able to enjoy the game.
---
So here we are, with most pvpers pvping on this sub rather than ingame. Atleast here the toxic casuals will try to fight back.
---
he got psychological help. thats pretty much it. and its also what he told possible employers in job interviews.
---
he had a finished apprenticeship but had to basically start at 0 because of the 2 year hole in his CV.
---
Season 3 has a lot of unique unlockables, including easy access to Ascended trinkets/breather, and the bloodstone reaction command which comes up during those specific boss fights that can happen in open world. 
---
Season 4 has tons of movement options: roller beetle, skyclaw, and position rewinder. 
---
Season 2 has . . frustration. Can't remember any major unlockables for it.
---
The "talented" part wasn't sarcasm.
---
Checked her work and find it really beautiful.
---
You're welcome! I'm no expert (I usually place high gold - low plat), but I see people (including myself) make those mistakes a lot.
---
Sometimes you have to adapt to the situation and go against role too. That's another mistake once people get a bit better at the game I see a lot--inflexibility. Make sure to look at the map frequently to see where you're needed. If no one is taking back home even though it's not your job it can be best to just do it yourself sometimes.
---
See? That's so much better than "What fun do you get from sucking at a videogame, and deliberately making it harder and more frustrating for yourself by refusing to improve?". May have taken you a week and a dozen underhanded attacks and insults and also still imply my motivations and reasoning and actions (e.g. demanding that those players don't get more of that enjoyment), but you CAN act roughly like a decent human being if you really want it.
---
However, we already had that part of our conversation. So you're not just still trying to drive the talk in circles until you get what you want but actually have forgotten where you stopped replying and what came beforehand, hop over to our [original conversation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/e25mkp/the_new_strike_missions_are_the_better_raids/f8tqf71/) and read back up and I'll be happy to continue our conversation.
---
It's because there is less and less people doing hard content every week. The only ones left are experienced players who just want quick clears with other experienced players. 
---
Sadly I think your best bet at CM fractals would be:
---
1. watch guide several times,make sure you understand mechanics.
---
2. know your class, what it brings to the party, how to play it and practice on aerodrome golems.
---
Then either:
---
a) keep trying making learning LFG.
---
b) try joining raid training guild or guild that wants to run hard content and doesn't mind new players. people there will probably be more patient than your average person from LFG and they might be willing to join CM fractals as they are quite similiar difficutly wise to most raid bosses.
---
c) Fake KP spam, join small KP groups and  just try it. You will see and experience mechanics and fights for yourself. You might fail, expect to be kicked. Basically "fake it till you make it".
---
&gt; One where griefing competitive players for trying to compete in ranked pvp isnt "friendly" or "positive" but actively ruins their enjoyment for the game.
---
in bronze 3?
---
i expect all the 12 taking it seriously are in platinum..
---
&gt;Clearly you not having to die much or getting easy gear is more important than other people being able to enjoy the game.
---
totally the opposite. to enjoy game a noob sadly need and ascended 2h . it's the fastest way to start fractal. i was just saying how they can earn one easy.
---
&gt;Atleast here the toxic casuals will try to fight back.
---
i do not get why u are taking it personal . what's the problem ?
---
Heh, fair enough. Yeah, in that level it really had an impact.
---
"Anymore". That makes it much better.
---
Also they ARE to blame for this. They actively ruin a gamemode. How are they not to blame?
---
They decide they deserve pvp rewards despite refusing to play it to the point of afking, even if that ruins the mode for everyone who plays differently and takes 9 other players hostage.
---
And here you are saying they arent to blame and you're an angel because you dont need the rewards anymore.
---
In any competitive game youd be put in a low priority queue with toxic players or banned outright. Because the behavior is toxic and refuses to empathise with others.
---
&gt; Season 2 has . . frustration.
---
... and some core Tyria mastery points. At some point in time it made sense to do those, because it was otherwise hard to master all things which would have required some expensive rare collections. Since they introduced additional core Tyria mastery points, this reason has gone, and what is left is mostly the story, but also some skins and possibly some ascended items (but those you can get easier elsewhere).
---
and really if ppl doing this in bronze   for a single season will ruin this to ppl in platinum it mean there are even fewer player that i expected still doing pvp ranked.
---
RIP. I actually purposefully tried to fix that. Can I change my link after the fact?
---
Thanks for clarifying.
---
Yeah this makes sense to me, I think it's the same with normal fractals and why t3 is so bad to get through until you get access to t4. I am not a fan of the lying about KP part so I'll probably just keep trying to make parties and watching guides ^^
---
^ this guy computes. :)
---
Yep exactly.
---
You're a stereotypical toxic casual. You grief other gamemodes and players for your own selfish gain. You do not consider other people at all. Yet you're upset when people say something negative about the game or about you... while you do it proudly to others without realising.
---
Fractals are made si you can progress through them naturally. You literally leeched pvp rewards while refusing to play it, griefing your allies and enemies in the process. How is that not toxic? All because you were entitled to easy rewards when you couldn't even be bothered playing... then reeeee about not being to blame.
---
Assuming it is sarcasm it's hardly vile at all. Like it's great this person has a job now and I'm happy for them but it's still an odd move by anet to hire more artists when that's not really what the game needs right now so people should absolutely be questioning it.
---
&gt; Furthermore a strike mission entrance in the aerodrome would be perfect.
---
seconded. tired of moving across most of a map, uphill no less, to reach the damn thing.
---
Nah they're also easy relative to some other games.
---
So you saying n00bs like yourself arent allowed to enjoy pvp because they arent in plat ? 
---
You literally cry about casuals and chill gamers all day,  but push comes to shove and you just want easy rewards and dont care about anyone else. That is the truth.
---
Well if they are doing it like silverwastes they will get the whole map but just the story they own so if they unlock just episode 2 they get the whole of Bjora but just the episode 2 story. Anet would never lock out content on one part of a map they didn't do it with Dry Top or Silverwastes and they'll not do it here.
---
Someone fetch me my "Shocked" face.
---
engi (preferably holosmith)
---
this necro looks great btw!
---
Logging in daily and doing dailies doesn't equate to being dedicated to the game? That makes absolutely no sense. If anything, would-be achievement hunters can just come in, knock out all the AP for a new release in a week, and then not touch the game for months on end until the next release.
---
Yeah, pretty much. That is where we are in gaming, at least for Gw2. People don’t want to login and do a job, they want to log in, have fun, feel like a god, and generally enjoy their time by letting their mind take a break from life. It is Anet’s fault for only allocating good rewards to content that requires brain cells and thus the community polarizes.
---
&gt;Like it's great this person has a job now and I'm happy for them
---
Yeah, you can stop right there.
---
tell lfg title, when you try to start a run, maybe the issue is there
---
&gt;  The strike bosses themselves don't even need to be all that dangerous or have all that much health, but failing the mechanics should result in severe punishment or death.
---
This so much.
---
And please don't let people skip them, at least not without considerable effort by every player involved.
---
It's of course not "on the nose" sarcasm that everybody and their grandma will understand it but if you have been on this subreddit in the last couple of months you will clearly know where the game lacks and the sarcasm should be very obvious.
---
After all if you don't know "what the game needs the most in it's current state." the sarcasm will of course not be that obvious.
---
Something along the lines of
---
(99CM p+f need x, y and z)
---
Then you should have stopped there instead you've gone out of your way to make a new person feel unwelcome and insult the company.
---
join a guild or make some friends that also want to learn or would be willing to help train. there's a guild called Mistlocked specifically created for fractals and they do training every Monday. they've made posts in this sub but if you can't find them and are interested i can find the leaders name when i get home.
---
i started at 0 exp and kp a couple months ago and am now at 230 just playing with friends every day.
---
ok
---
Obviously everyone wants to have fun, I’m not debating that. The problem that can’t be solved for this game is player polarization. Casuals want good rewards. Hardcore players want good rewards. The only good rewards are in hardcore content. Casuals want to be casual and get rewards so they go into hardcore content casually. The hardcore players get but hurt if rewards are too easy to get because they need to feed their e-peen. The player base is split and there is literally nothing that can change it at this point.
---
I thought this was impossible without condi firebrand? Also nice warrior pov. Who knew rifle would be better than torch on power war
---
All of the MTG sagas are stunningly beautiful, but her [The Eldest Reborn](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/LYeYv?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) is my personal favourite. Looking forward to her work at ArenaNet
---
Yeh so? The only thing I said was: "I feel this game is more than alive". If I see constant people around me that means it is alive to me. I don't care that those are the only ones actually playing. You are just bashing to bash.   
---
For example, I see less ppl in all the area's in World of Warcraft that I also play. However there way more ppl playing that game so it feels less alive.  
---
This game feels more alive, get it?  
---
I played Wildstars to the bitter end, and I could play upon hours without seeing anyone. They used about the same sharding as GW2. That game felt less alive.
---
So...you agree that it can be an easy one to miss?
---
i see quite a few (cms+t4  need x, y and z, low kp run)
---
and those fill up pretty fast, could try as well
---
Hey folks!
---
Just posted a guide to Healbrand and anted to share. Healbrand is in a super good spot in fractals (maybe even toooooo good) but nonetheless wanted to give some understanding to a few different builds you can run for it.
---
I use these builds on the daily in Fractals, so keep in mind I made this build with that frame of mind, but it’s still pretty much the same in other content should you make a few gear or trait swaps.
---
Anywho, enjoy!
---
Went from excited to heartbroken in like 0.5 seconds, thanks
---
&gt; The difficulty is low enough so everyone can enjoy it
---
Strike Missions were supposed to be a stepping stone to raids, which means it should be difficulty wise between HoT hero challenges and easy raid bosses. Problem is that this is not the case. The champion arrowhead from the [hero challenge] in Auric Basin is way deadlier than any of the strikes.
---
No one could have possibly known
---
First
---
Hardest so far with my group. We wiped at 25% instead of just beating it first try. After a little chat about bring a bit more cleanse we got it Gold.
---
I am disgusted by this kill. EU &gt; NA
---
I see daily several groups not asking for KP in lfg, just join those or start lfg yourself
---
Well, can't be sure nowadays but I think OP was supposed to be a sarcasm.
---
Tell me more about the internal workings of the company LOL. Maybe they should hire you.
---
Look at how long the prep is just to kill a boss under 40s this must be a joke, I do it faster in my daily pug clear groups
---
Good job fellow friends!
---
LS4 &gt; LS3
---
Sorry I dont find cutting plants in random region or clicking on a vista in a random map daily a dedication. This is stupidity. 
---
Doing fractals daily for years, raiding even tho your rewards are done for the week, spending time in dungeons even tho it is very bad profit per hour... Doing meta train daily,... this is dedication. All of this activities are PvE, yet, clearing a full raid wing, doing fractals and dungeons daily, doing 8 metas is aparently not enough dedication to be granted 10 AP, while some suckers pick 4 plants, click on a vista and talk to a vendor is.
---
Some people point it out that without buying expension you have less option for classes but didnt explain why, so here I go.
---
Each expension HoT and PoF (that are now sold togheter) give you each 1 extra specialisation for each classes. In GW2, your build will be define by your choice of 3 specialisations (5 specialisations from core and 2 from expensions) and you could only equip 1 from expension at the same time. Those specialisation when equip: change core classes gameplay, give you one more weapon option and skills options. Exemple: Thief as core class have 2 dodges but with the specialisation Daredevil (from HoT), you get an extra dodge (so you have 3 dodges) with extra effect when you dodge, you can weild staff as close combat weapon and have access to physical skills. As core class Thief can be a really good class in PvP for spiking down ennemy, but with Daredevil you became better in 1v1 and team fight.
---
So yeah, in theory F2P have chances against none F2P but you have way less option of builds available and roles your classes could do. With that in mind, if you get queue with a team that lack team fight power, you have less option to tweak your build before the game start.
---
I love her MtG art, this is exciting!
---
You're doing this again. And, since you did the same thing to the other post of mine, I did not refer to you as trash because I think less of you (even though I do) but because you are actively pretending to be inept in order to get stuff for free, which is lazy and directly detrimental for the game in overall.
---
Also, when it comes to whiteknighting anything, I don't think I am. It's mostly, however, because I think that having harder content for people to excell at is good. It is also good that not everyone gets to do everything with no effort whatsoever. Our baseline is that there should be harder repeatable content because living story is not sustainable in the long run, and when Anet tries to sit on the fence we get Adashin, where hc people are bored and casuals still can't clear bosses. Conversely, when you get hc focused stuff, like dhuum or 100cm (even though there are some strange design choices, like no real indication for the next reaper to defend)
---
While casuals seem to think that more casual content is better, even though it's bugged. Not to mention that you seem to be happy that stuff that's supposed to prepare you for raids is not even close to the level of raids it's supposed to prepare you for.
---
Might be, yeah.
---
your daily pug clear groups need 3min for the boss though
---
It is very easy to take 3 parts of a theorycraft and improve it... No one was ever doubting your ability as a group.. but making a meme about cfb seems uneccesery... suggesting it was propaganda is completely over the top... In the minimal testing we did do, i struggled to meet the dps check for the 4th platform on dh... I ended up testing only once (one pull total) with sword dh. (you in this pov are fine tuned.) We discovered the portal strat, the cheeky 100% bd quickness preboon and range strat that you used in this pov... YES we knew you would finely tune it and at no point did i say cfb would be BIS, i said in the current meta (49s - ours) with TWO slb ranging the adds, it seemed best in slot. This pov is very impressive, but instead of slating "false propoganda" ; commend our group (who are still looking for a 5th person... e.g. we arnt even a full static) for finding what we did.
---
There is evidence that a raven portal mastery will be added next release to make travel easier/faster. Since they hate waypoints now.
---
Nah, just don't be a dick.
---
I would like that in the basement of the aerodrome.
---
A set of stairs somewhere in the wall of the main floor leading to a floor below the main floor, set as rooms with a few walls as separation, with entrances to strikes in its walls and a gate to Fractals in the middle.
---
Season 4, then Season 3, then Season 2.
---
You were literally me about 40 days ago. 
---
I did T4's. Asked if anyone wanted to do CM if we were a good group. We tried. We failed but at least I knew the difficulty.
---
I checked LFG regularly for "CM training" or I made my own. I only played Alacren. I'm now at 38KP and I find it easy to make groups when I list my own "CM 30+ KP". Takes about 10 minutes.
---
Trying to find it on the wiki but I must be overlooking it. What level do I need a character to be for 450 in a crafting discipline? What are the level limits for each tier of crafting? I'm assuming there is a level limit based on character level.
---
Thanks!
---
I believe we came to that conclusion after some discussion, yes. 
---
This comment might be misleading then: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/e0o61j/fractal\_cm\_skorvald\_50sec\_world\_record/f8gf31f?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/e0o61j/fractal_cm_skorvald_50sec_world_record/f8gf31f?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

But why would you run 2 slbs when your torch warrior could just run rifle lol where did you guys come up with that idea?

Imagine purposely hiding strats, stating classes are required, and using CC cons on an impressive kill only to get absolutely demolished by 10sec+ on a sub minute run.

When you start a new character, you'll need to...
---
1. unlock Waypoints, POI, Vista, Hero Points and other maps again.

2. replay story mode of dungeons to unlock them.

3. earn new gear for that character.

4. learn the new profession and mechanics.

1. achievements

This is a post welcoming a new person to the community and you and all these other people with "opinions" (read: backhanded compliments and poorly held insults) are choosing to be dicks to a completely random person. "Jesus Christ" would be the first person to tell you not to be a dick to people. You people disgust me and make our community look like a bunch of assholes. Totally not surprised if Arena Net completely avoids this sub now.
---
the condi variant isnt as dependand on crit as power builds
---
I have well over 250 KP well "had" spent them on the Asura Arkk potion and red infusion. But I can tell you that these KP reqs hardly make things "faster". You wipe once wether it's your fault or not someone or everyone leaves. Take to long but the boss is dead anyways? Someone leaves.....I have been healer, AND DPS. I can say that at least 50% of the time I played with "experienced" players it takes just as long or longer. Because we wait for a one or several new people to fill back up....then you have the show proof then most likely SOMEONE questions the build and...just...ugh....I could literally go on forever!!! On how shitty pub groups are and that a group of people who know the mechanics and maybe take a bit longer and maybe wipe once will get it done faster. Of course these groups I mean. (the ones I loved) if we wiped we almost knew right away if DPS was an issue or just some silly miss clicks. Figured it out and the person (if DPS or messing up mechanics) would agree or say hey guys I guess I'm just not with it today or my build is just not doing X sorry.
---
Once I got those 2 exclusive items other then missing the liquid gold from doing all Fractals daily, CMs, recs. I am so much happier skipping them now or unless you REALLY want those items stick with daily groups and do those. If I ever decide or the few times I rarely feel like running fracs I just join a simple daily no CM's group and get in and out super fast.
---
TLDR: the experienced groups are such perfectionists that they 50% of the time take longer to complete these CM's. Compared with a group who understand it and stay even if the kill takes longer or wipe knowing it was about silly mistakes then a DPS problem.
---
you go try to make a game without artists on your dev team. artists do more than draw pretty pictures in game studios, they also sculpt terrain, help with level design, model and animate effects, etc. 
---
as for programming, you can only have so many coders working in the core code at time or they begin tripping over each other, breaking each others additions, and slowing down development instead of speeding it up. you end up with a situation where a studio has to decide where to focus it's resources on. if they go back and fix and rework old code they will not have access to put in new content for a long time. It is a problem that money and manpower does not quickly solve.
---
Yeah, from the snippet I read here, he has justified his points while you rather bitch about his tone rather than his arguments. Sounds rather manipulative, don't you think?
---
I was assured that Rifle didnt keep up with the raneg dmg as slb :/ and we then didnt look into it further
---
You are somewhat misguided.
---
AFK people atill count a lot since it bring numbers and number brings more viewers.
---
Plus a lot of people just place the game on sound only since they just want that LAN feeling of someone playing the game with you.
---
About toxicity, thats a common side effect of having bigger viewnership. If MightTeapot were to 4x his amount of daily viewers you would naturally notice more toxicity in chat.
---
This is unrelated to thedrops thenselves.
---
[/u/Anet-Clayton](https://www.reddit.com/u/Anet-Clayton) any chance you can give us some infos about this please?
---
[removed]
---
Just cycling through water and earth gives you a lot of sustain.   
---
Burn Weaver can ditch a bunch of stats and fill them up with whatever's comfortable. 
---
You Focus on condi dmg and 100% fire duration (easier to get than full-on condi duration).   
---
The rest of the stats you can put into precision for condies on crit, or power/ferocity for bonus flat damage. 
---
Alternatively, you can fill them up with vitality or toughness, giving up the burn on crit for tankyness
---
That's awesome! Hope you are having fun with the game :)
---
Oh, so you can express your opinion but others should mind their business if that opinion is directed at you? See a problem there?
---
i stan for calling out ppl's bullshit 💖 
---
tho i disagree about CC consumables, i see class skills as unnecessary cause consumables exist and are better
---
Nah, it's only her. Trust reddit, they know exactly what anet payroll forecasts need,  they've been playing the game for years!
---
You want to learn the CMs?    
---
Learn a support class like Healbrand or Alacragade.    
---
They're in-demand as are intelligent, skilled, flexible and adaptable players.  Frankly, they're seen as more valuable than your average DPS player.  Average DPS players hit maybe 40-50% of their benchmarks in normal T4's -- it's not good...  So, when they try to transition to CMs before hitting 80% consistently?  Drama.    
---
I'd encourage anyone seriously considering CMs to learn a support class first because you have more direct control over defensive utility.  Most people are so overwhelmed by the mechanics on Mama, Siax, Artsari IV or Arkk that \*that\* 40-50% benchmark they're so proud of \^/s goes right out the window.    
---
I've taught 100cm to several groups of less skilled friends at this point.  It's a highly structured, phase-centric fight and the less comfortable you are with your DPS rotation the harder it's going to be.  Speaking candidly, CMs don't really need more bargain-bin DPS players -- decide how much you want to get into them!   
---
Harrier's or Minstrels for Firebrand and Diviners (ugh) for Renegade.  The truth is that most people aren't willing to take the hit to be team players and learn the CMs.  The most in-demand roles aren't DPS -- they're \^ the support classes.
---
my group had same problem
---
You mean the pre-event should end when everything is ready for the meta without waiting 3-4min doing nothing?
---
An Asuran Druid would be cute and not cause she's my main or anything...
---
People on this sub would complain if they hired a new janitor or a plumber to fix the toilets. There are just way more people here now that want to shit on everything and anything and won't ever be happy so trying to make them happy is rather pointless. Just going through this post I think I only counted 3 or 4 people that had anything positive or welcoming to say *in a welcome thread.*
---
There's nothing to stop people from creating their own post to bitch about specifics. There's nothing to stop them from commenting in dozen other posts that are already bitching. Yet, here we are in a welcome post and the majority of the comments are unwelcoming, back-handed insults, and open hostility and when called out on their dickish behavior all they do is embrace it and claim they have the right to state their "opinions". Sure they do, but they don't have to do it in this post, that's what makes them dicks and this a sub full of assholes.
---
Arah does not need high dps anyways
---
I see that you’re trying to read into what I said and offer some half baked rebuttal to something you’re implying I said 🙄
---
Telling ppl to “stop right there” as a way to literally tell them to stop expressing their opinions cause you personally don’t like them and telling someone to avoid a space that is for whatever reason causing them so much stress instead of hanging around a space centered around sharing opinions that they clearly cannot handle in any other way than “hey stop saying that mean thing I don’t like wahhh” are two different things. 
---
But hey, at least you tried.
---
And the break bar in the strike version is crazy.  The blue bar popped up and it was EMPTY / broken at the same time I got my CC clicked half a second later. Like it broke from the first or second hit. Then after the fight, I went out onto the map and the champ was up and I dropped CC on that 3 or 4 times and it barely made a dent wtf
---
Who would win, [the Marshal of the Pact, or a dead cow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gU9H7zaD6zs)?
---
I can see improvement in your drawing skills, it's really cool. (with a host of humorous details =p)
---
Thanks for sharing your work =)
---
And half the people in pug groups fake their KP as well. I run CMs daily, I used to lie consistently on my KP, if I only had 8 I'd get a code for 132 join the 75+ runs and no one would be wiser usually #2 or #1 in dps, able to backup ball, do anomalies it doesnt matter meanwhile everyone goes silent when asked. Got my LNHB title off a "Ping your pants for KP" run. Had less than 10 ess, half my guild has or does fake their KP and I can tell who fakes theirs but if its clean with minimal mistakes no one cares.
---
People who work in one place for a long time tend to get antsy. It doesn't necessarily reflect badly on the company itself when higher-ups want to move on to do other things. 
---
There is a basic cycle in game development that you get a small group of high-energy dreamers, they put together some projects, get successful, put together some bigger projects, repeat, until they put together a project that is "too big to fail," one that tends to take up all their time and resources because it's so popular that they can't just abandon it, but at the same time, they are creatives, and they "did that thing already," so they want to do other projects, but they don't have the time for that, so eventually they leave the company so they can work on those other projects instead. That doesn't mean that the original project was bad, just that *they* were tired of working on that one thing. New talent comes on board to take on the project with fresh eyes. There is nothing wrong with that, and sometimes the second or third generation teams can produce some of the best work.
---
Pretty sure that's illegal
---
bjora marches.
---
game pretty much is dead on NA ime outside of peak time, ~1 hour ish before reset - ~3 hours after.
---
Cantha confirmed?
---
New content dropped so many people there, plus with megaservers the game fills one and then spins up more maps as needed and closes them when pop drop below a certain point. Also some times during the day is low activity cause people converge on certain metas and bosses.
---
doesn't really work that way.
---
Pretty sure that guy was being sarcastic aswell.
---
Basically we work on precedent.
---
But the general thought behind artsariiv is that we do not use cc consumables on the boss itself.
---
HoT maps are definitely still active during meta hours, but mostly only during those meta hours. If you did show up during a meta you might also not be in the active map aka overflow map so you need to look at the LFG 
---
WvW population is definitely in dire straits and old LS maps are not really that active.
---
Come back in 44 minutes.
---
&gt; And unfaithful people say game is dying. LUL what? What's the logic behind here? 
---
The logic is that *they* are unhappy for various reasons, so **obviously** everyone *else* is unhappy, because how could *they* have an unpopular opinion?
---
Yeah i too i wonder, and it's not that those patches are big or something.
---
I take full credit for this.
---
I can choose a different word.
---
Disgusting
---
Repugnant
---
Very distasteful
---
Revolting
---
Whichever you like. I was just looking for the right word to describe my reaction which was an audible disgusted "Ugh" when I realized the comment was probably sarcasm and then again when I saw it was the cop comment. So, disappointed with the community in this sub.
---
It's less about being loyal to a company, and more about being loyal to a community and to people who have crafted art that has given you countless hours of happiness. There's nothing wrong with that.
---
Lv2, there are no workbenches in the intro instance
---
He who makes the lfg sets the kp requirements. Make of that what you will
---
Explain?
---
Patches are always 12PM (ET) 9AM (PT)  
---
With delays only if inconvenient issues. (Looks at Jormag's you are up to no good again, are you?) (He/She want ANet to stay and rest) xD
---
I don't know what that is but I'm looking forward to finding out. This reminded me there should be a new strike mission today so I'm excited to play that as well.
---
&gt; It can give the illusion that the game is "alive", but there is a possibility that the 20 people you see in Queensdale are the only 20 people in the whole North American/European continent that are in Queensdale.
---
That's possible, not *every* map will be, or *should* be fully populated, but plenty of maps are. I mean going by LFG alone there were about a dozen maps of Bjora's March running during the blizzard at 2am, and probably more on top of that that weren't advertising. So long as people can find active maps, it's working as intended.
---
You know DST is a thing?
---
I can't see how this is a bad thing.
---
It is possible.  When you start the Caladbolg questline, you'll be given some silly dialogue options in case you threw it away, and there'll be a recipe for the Mystic Forge you can use to get it back.
---
&gt; I am hoping that they'll just give you the previous episodes of the saga, because otherwise they'll just straight up split the map into different chunks, and they can buzzword us to death with 'expanding' map each episode as much as they want, but it's just a 'new map' for that one season, with chunks that are just not accessible, and if the previous map is not accessible, how are they going to integrate the 3rd tier of mastery into the existing unlocking system. Are players just going to go into the 2nd chunk of the map and have it unlocked? Will they have to play another intro scene where they re-explain the mastery of raven and stuff? Because if so, the first interaction with the raven mastery to unlock the door just becomes useless fluff.
---
I can't imagine that they would lock "expanded" portions of the map only to people who bought that episode. My assumption is that if you took a year off now and came back, then you would have full access to Bjora Marches if you had any of it, you would just be missing the attached story missions and access to certain rewards. You might also be missing certain masteries, I suppose, that could make traversal more annoying.
---
That's because you're a toxic casual, and not a bright one at it.
---
Luckily, even if you dont see it, you're shooting yourself in the foot. And I'll be watching while you blame it on everyone else. :)
---
Check during character creation or using a Makeover Kit, there's a "glow pattern" colour, different patterns based on the skin type, and a slider to increase/decrease the intensity of the glow.  You'll need to set the toggle to night to see it.  If the intensity is at minimum, your sylvari won't glow.
---
I don't believe they will split it like that. I believe that once the map is complete, if you can get onto the map, you can access the entire map (although you might be missing important masteries).
---
How am i being "toxic" now? Explain.
---
You know you can't just twist words into meaning whatever you want them to mean right?
---
It was a different scenery back then because we didn't have mounts. Maps didn't seem as small as they do now since we can currently traverse even the biggest maps in a mere minute. Running and fighting through the maps. I am actually a bit triggered in LWS 4 and Icebrood in regards of dialogues because some overlap when you pass close to them. When I talk to the other main characters some random side NPC would start his own dialogue and completely throw me off. I didn't rly see that in Season 3 and PoF for instance.
---
Yes I know, I didn't look at the username when I replied. My bad!
---
&gt; And yeah, no expansions while the game getting less and less content is not maintenance mode.
---
They released four story chapters this year and a raid, which is more content than any previous year. There was no expansion, but they already announced a while back that they were not doing an expansion after s4, they're trying something else. That's not automatically a bad thing. We'll have to see how s5 plays out. 
---
**Making new content is not maintenance mode.**
---
They are easy to make, and it's fine that they are craftable. I just think they could have made the meta *also* give them out as a rare drop for performing well in the meta, like leystone armor in DS.
---
Any and all opinions are welcome, and views of newer players are always great. I play the game for somewhat longer, and I played LWS 3 during the time we didn't have mounts. I know that newer content always seems more polished than the old one, and I am by no means saying that LWS 4 was bad. On the contrary I loved it, but also felt that the story was somewhat linear.
---
C) is terrible advice.
---
Just say the thruth and you will be fine.
---
I ask for 100ess in my groups, and many times a player joins and asks if it's ok with lower ess (10, 20, 50 etc). 
---
I never seen anyone tell them off. Like literally not once. Also people will help the new guy with mechanics they don't master yet.
---
Meanwhile, someone with the same skill level faking kp will get kicked (and i personally block them so they don't see my lfg posts).
---
Maps generally get population spikes around active metas. Few maps like SW and Dragonfall actually get consistent activity, and even then it will mostly be during peak times (i.e. not during the day on a workday like a Tuesday.).
---
Granted, more people will be pulled to the newest map
---
So much this!
---
Arenanet ran out of fucks to give about their game
---
How's today's patch gonna change anything for pve healbrand?
---
WvW is anathema to both short games *and* self-contained game loops.
---
PvP has the potential for short matches, but the combat is and always will be slow as pitch dropping.
---
As I said, ship of theseus
---
dId YoU jUsT sAy DeD gAeM?
---
&gt; When has the community ever complained about Anet hiring new coders, and linking it to poor marketing? 
---
So, Mr Strawman-Fallacy-Expert, where in
---
&gt; "Who? **Why** are you **telling us this**? Your marketing sucks!"
---
did I imply that **"community complained about hiring"**, or that it **"linked hiring too poor marketing"**?
---
The truth is that the absolute vast majority in the community does not care about the gritty details of the behindworks; honestly, just compare the upvotes on art and fluff here compared to builds and speedkills. And even when some dev says "it's the engine's limitation", everyone becomes an expert and throws easy solutions, like "that other guy did it better for free!", or "you suck so get fired and get a better guy!"
---
If you're selling *fun experiences* - such as story-centered RPGs with cool environments and fashion - you don't really market the gritty details; at most, design decisions in some blog post, and even then those get met with harsh criticism, which makes it rarely worth it. If you're focusing on mechanic-heavy content, like proper raids for hardcore audience? Maybe, but that's not about GW2, is it. If ANet said, "so, we hired that guy and he was quite good at handling databases at that other game company", the absolute majority would be befuddled - "So? You hired a guy for a thing a game needs? Isn't that how it should be? What are you --- so proud of, go make new content and fix bugs!"
---
And even that said... neither was actually marketed officially (because advertising this would be kind of weird - people come and go all the time). It's just, as I already said in another comment, some jobs tend to be more public and community-oriented than other ones, so that information comes out naturally and, naturally, forms informational imbalance.
---
i only really have one high tier capable fractal Character and that's my Support druid. probably isnt in the meta but it works i think
---
I feel like the ingots are going to play a bigger part and Strike missions are a fun way to get them. I've been helping my wife get her skyscale but really feel like I need to concentrate on getting all the ingots I can get every day before I regret not doing it in the future.
---
I didn't insult anyone...
---
When I mean AFK I mean stream is on but completely muted and unattended simply for drops.
---
Plz relax. None is ruining game for no one.  I was just explaining why ppl go afk and from their point of view is the best thing to do. My kind of playstyle do not ruin game for none .tx God there are many who play gw2 as a single player game and that's why anet changed target from hardcore players to casual.
---
We are toxic ? No we are the ones who scream less. We just do out game

I can't believe it.
---
Another meme has died..
---
sry i cant be bothered with last  5 peasants which still living dream of 2010. gl with pvp and stuff...
---
Capes! And it looks like dye able!
---
We've made it, boys. We're in the future now!
---
Looking forward to seeing these with some of the more active animations like daredevil staff #2 and #5. If I remember this correctly, cape physics looked pretty wild with the flips assassins did in the first game.
---
People rotate from map to map for metas just like they did with world boss trains.  If you aren't on those maps at those times, it'll look pretty dead.  After reset is the most active and as the day progresses, it slowly dies down as people finish what they are capped at doing per day.
---
LOL CAPES!
---
Guild cape finally?
---
The post is 91% upvoted, if that's your definition of "reacting negatively", I don't know how you would handle actual negativity. You are just seeing negativity because you're just choosing to look only at the negative and troll comments. The highest rated comment in this thread are all extremely positive.

Afking ruins the game for others and is toxic. Its griefing in almost all competitive games and generally punished. You'll learn one day :)

---
&gt; # 12/03/2019—December 3 Release Notes
---
&gt;## Quality of Life
---
&gt;- Wardrobe: New checkboxes have been added to each weapon, giving players the option to hide their weapon when it is stowed.
---
&gt;- Ascended feasts have been added to Guild Storage in the Consumables tab. Guilds that have unlocked the tavern may speak to the tavern proprietor to deposit their crafted food for the guild&amp;#39;s use.
---
&gt;- Some Looking for Group categories have been reorganized for better readability.
---
&gt;- Leveling up and items that grant levels and experience now display a less noisy visual effect to other players.
---
&gt;- Build and Equipment Templates last used in PvE, WvW, and PvP will now be remembered, and they will be automatically activated when returning to that game mode.
---
&gt;- Changing Equipment Templates will now equip the correct weapons rather than cause players to swap to their second weapon set.
---
&gt;- The revenant&amp;#39;s inactive legend utility skills will now be remembered when players transition between terrestrial and aquatic skills.
---
&gt;- When revenants copy build links, they will now correctly include the inactive legend utility skills.
---
&gt;- PvP weapon sigils, amulets, and runes have been integrated into Equipment Templates, allowing players to customize their PvP equipment while outside of PvP game modes.
---
&gt;  - A button has been added to the Equipment section of the Hero panel that allows players to toggle between viewing standard equipment and PvP equipment.
---
&gt;      - Note: Because equipped weapons are shared between all game modes, they are displayed in both views.
---
&gt;  - PvP equipment can also be quickly accessed by clicking the existing PvP Build button while in the PvP lobby or by using the PvP Build keybind.
---
&gt;- Mist Champions have been integrated into the PvP panel and now have a much larger character preview.
---
&gt;- Because all functionality has been moved to other menus, the old PvP Build/Equipment panel has been retired.
---
&gt;- Dynamic HUD has been added to the game!
---
&gt;  - Dynamic HUD gives players the ability to show or hide parts of the UI while in or out of combat. The UI can also be set to always be hidden.
---
&gt;  - A new section within the General Options tab of the Options panel has been added to control Dynamic HUD. Components of the UI have been grouped into related sections.
---
&gt;  - Several presets are available for players to choose from, or players can individually control the behavior of each section.
---
&gt;## General
---
&gt;- Capes have been added to the game as a new type of back item skin. The first cape, the Basic Guild Cape, is available from Guild Commendation Traders.
---
&gt;## Living World
---
&gt;### Bjora Marches
---
&gt;- Storms of Winter: Increased the maximum scaling of the &amp;quot;Defeat the icebrood construct before it reaches Havroun Weibe&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Defend Raven shrines to keep energy flowing to Havroun Weibe&amp;quot; events. This is represented in game by increased health when there are high player counts. When player counts are lower, health will not be impacted.
---
&gt;- The Wind and Nothing More: Fixed an issue in the &amp;quot;Help Braham search the Sons of Svanir barracks&amp;quot; event in which a line of dialog wasn&amp;#39;t correctly labeled in the chat log as coming from &amp;quot;Unknown.&amp;quot;
---
&gt;- The Southeast Barracks Camp and Northwest Barracks Camp have been updated as follows:
---
&gt;  - The bonfires inside these two camps will now help against the blizzard.
---
&gt;  - Animations on weapon racks and cook&amp;#39;s supplies now appear as intended when being attacked.
---
&gt;  - The drop rate of Sons of Svanir Battle Plans has been increased.
---
&gt;  - Fixed an issue in which friendly NPCs could cause the Enraged Cook to appear.
---
&gt;- The bonfires inside the Northeast Prisoner Camp and the &amp;quot;Search Svanir camps for survivors&amp;quot; event will now help against the blizzard.
---
&gt;## Items
---
&gt;- Feisty Feline Tonic: Reduced the maximum height of Lunge.
---
&gt;- Superior Rune of the Revenant: Fixed a bug in which the sixth bonus would not grant concentration or expertise.
---
&gt;- Fixed an issue in which miniatures from the Icebrood Saga were not being sorted in the correct order in the Miniatures section of the Equipment tab.
---
&gt;## Profession Skills
---
&gt;With a larger competitive-focused update on the horizon, this update is on the smaller side but still contains several notable systemic changes. Falling damage traits are being removed in order to free up design space and reduce the complexity of adept-tier traits. Revival traits are also seeing the removal of the 10% revival speed passive effect that we&amp;#39;ve been slowly phasing out over the last several updates. In exchange, skills that directly revive allies are seeing enhancements. Besides these changes, we are also making some small touch-ups to various skills and traits related to previous updates that we felt didn&amp;#39;t quite hit everything. We have also had the opportunity to add a couple quality-of-life updates to better improve the readability of player attributes affected by traits, and we&amp;#39;re now granting elementalists and engineers the ability to swap weapons _while out of combat_. Lastly, the format for some types of value updates is changing—instead of listing the percentage difference, we&amp;#39;ll be telling you what the coefficients before and after a change will be. We hope this will helps improve readability significantly.
---
&gt;### General
---
&gt;- Griffonrook Run: While holding the bomb, falling damage is now reduced by 50%.
---
&gt;- Traits that affect attributes now display icons that represent said attributes instead of a generic up arrow.
---
&gt;- Hero Panel: Fixed a bug that prevented attribute adjustments from displaying while a player was transformed.
---
&gt;### Elementalist
---
&gt;In previous updates, several traits that had global cooldowns were changed to having cooldowns per target. Blinding Ashes wasn&amp;#39;t included in those updates, but we felt it could use the small bonus to usability.
---
&gt;- Starting at level 10, elementalists can now swap weapons while out of combat, gaining an additional pair of weapon slots on their Hero panel.
---
&gt;- Arcane Abatement: Fall damage functionality has been removed from this trait. This trait has been renamed Arcane Restoration.
---
&gt;- Glyph of Renewal: Reduced recharge to 90 seconds in all game modes. Lowered casting time from 3.25 seconds to 2 seconds.
---
&gt;- Arcane Resurrection: This trait no longer increases revival speed. Auras granted by this trait are now granted only to the elementalist, and they&amp;#39;re now granted at the start of a revival attempt rather than at the end. This effect has a 20-second cooldown.
---
&gt;- Blinding Ashes: The cooldown on this trait is now determined on a per-target basis.
---
&gt;### Engineer
---
&gt;We read your feedback on Detection Pulse feeling odd as the Purge Gyro&amp;#39;s toolbelt skill and your desire to see Chemical Field returned. While we agree with the sentiment overall that there is more gameplay and interesting options with Chemical Field, there is also important counterplay present with Detection Pulse. As we can&amp;#39;t place Purge Gyro&amp;#39;s Detection Pulse back on the elite toolbelt slot, we&amp;#39;re instead replacing Utility Goggles&amp;#39; lackluster toolbelt skill, Analyze, with Detection Pulse. Utility Goggles is also getting a small but significant change from granting fury to instead granting some brief resistance.
---
&gt;- Starting at level 10, engineers can now swap weapons while out of combat, gaining an additional pair of weapon slots on their Hero panel.
---
&gt;- Grenadier: Fall damage reduction has been removed from this trait. This trait now also casts Lesser Grenade Barrage on your location when using a healing skill.
---
&gt;- Positive Strike: The power coefficient of this skill has been reduced from 0.88 to 0.7.
---
&gt;- Negative Bash: The power coefficient of this skill has been increased from 0.88 to 1.
---
&gt;- Equalizing Blow: The power coefficient of this skill has been increased from 1.2 to 1.4.
---
&gt;- Function Gyro: Fixed a bug that could cause the gyro to be destroyed with control effects while stability was active.
---
&gt;- Purge Gyro: This skill&amp;#39;s toolbelt skill has been changed from Detection Pulse to Chemical Field.
---
&gt;- Utility Goggles: This skill no longer grants fury or provides immunity to blindness. It now grants resistance and removes blindness when used. This skill&amp;#39;s toolbelt skill has been changed from Analyze to Detection Pulse.
---
&gt;- Toss Elixir R: This skill no longer removes 1 condition when thrown. Projectile speed has been increased by 25%. The projectile thrown by this skill is now unblockable. Fixed an issue in which the land and water versions of this skill moved at different speeds.
---
&gt;- Toss Elixir U: Fixed a bug that could cause this skill to put friendly targets in combat.
---
&gt;### Guardian
---
&gt;Guardian is unique among the professions in how many revival traits it has. With this rework, we are updating Courageous Return into a new, more general trait that benefits the guardian in situations when reviving allies is not possible. Additionally, we&amp;#39;re changing the healing power bonus on Signet of Mercy to a concentration bonus as we feel it&amp;#39;s generally a more useful stat for the profession given the amount of boons it outputs even when the guardian is not acting as a healer.
---
&gt;- Protector&amp;#39;s Strike: This skill now fully charges the flames of justice upon the successful block of an attack for the guardian or their allies. The radius of effect of both blocking and striking enemies has been increased from 180 to 240.

4 channels, mentioned in the blogpost

Thanks guys! I am looking to nab a second account for daily crafting gates and extra mystic coins. So getting to 450 won't be bad since my main account can fund it.
---
Capes need to flow :(
---
Well! It's almost like you already made up your mind and only try to prove your bias! What a shocking revelation!
---
Feels like this is the best compromise they could have done for charrs.
---
#DYNANIC HUD
---
how stupid are you?
---
\+1 hour now cuz of daylight saving.
---
&gt;Wardrobe: New checkboxes have been added to each weapon, giving players the option to hide their weapon when it is stowed.
---
No more do our shields turn off back pieces when out of combat!
---
I mean at this point it's not surprising they're in the gemstore but it's still a pretty shitty thing to do after all those years ?
---
&gt;- Protector&amp;#39;s Impact: Fall damage functionality has been removed from this trait. This trait has been renamed Protector&amp;#39;s Restoration.
---
&gt;- Signet of Mercy: Reduced recharge to 90 seconds in all game modes. Changed the passive effect from granting 180 healing power (216 when traited) to granting 120 concentration (150 when traited).
---
&gt;- Protective Reviver: This trait no longer increases revival speed and no longer grants boons on a successful revival. Fixed the skill fact to show the correct 3-second duration. Fixed a bug that prevented the recharge of Lesser Shield of Absorption from being affected by Stalwart Defender. Lesser Shield of Absorption now heals nearby allies when it ends. Upon detonation, this trait also now causes all versions of Shield of Absorption to revive allies by 15% in PvE and 3% in competitive modes.
---
&gt;- Courageous Return: This trait has been reworked and renamed Steadfast Courage. It now grants the guardian protection for 3 seconds in PvE and 1 second in PvP and WvW whenever aegis on the guardian is removed due to blocking an attack.
---
&gt;### Mesmer
---
&gt;While we think the new version of Chaotic Interruption is pretty powerful, it doesn&amp;#39;t really feel like it&amp;#39;s working if you aren&amp;#39;t looking at your skill bar. We&amp;#39;re adding some additional effects to give players a better sense of when it activates.
---
&gt;- Descent into Madness: Fall damage functionality has been removed from this trait. This trait has been renamed Method of Madness.
---
&gt;- Medic&amp;#39;s Feedback: This trait no longer increases revival speed. It now causes Feedback to revive allies inside the dome by 5% per second.
---
&gt;- Feedback: Fixed an issue that prevented this skill&amp;#39;s visual effects from lining up with its physical effects.
---
&gt;- Chaotic Interruption: Added additional visual effects to this trait to show when it activates.
---
&gt;### Necromancer
---
&gt;In addition to the updates to the revival skill Signet of Undeath and the falling damage trait Terrifying Descent, we are also revisiting a few issues from previous updates. Unholy Sanctuary is getting an update to help it better compete with the other updates to the Death Magic line, and Manifest Sand Shade is having its recharge reduced in PvE to make it easier to reposition shades.
---
&gt;- Terrifying Descent: This trait has been reworked. It has been renamed Insidious Disruption. It now causes control effects to inflict torment on foes.
---
&gt;- Signet of Undeath: Reduced recharge to 75 seconds in all game modes. Reduced casting time from 3 seconds to 1.5 seconds. Reduced the number of allies revived from 3 to 1. Added an additional health cost of 50% of base health to this skill. Increased the passive life force gain by 100%.
---
&gt;- Sand Swell: Once activated, this skill can no longer be canceled by movement.
---
&gt;- Plaguelands: Reduced recharge from 120 seconds to 90 seconds in PvE only.
---
&gt;- Unholy Sanctuary: This trait now heals a percentage of your maximum health each second while in shroud. This value is 2% in PvE and 1% in competitive modes.
---
&gt;- Manifest Sand Shade: This skill no longer inflicts cripple in all game modes. Reduced ammunition recharge for the untraited version of this skill from 15 seconds to 8 seconds in PvE only.
---
&gt;### Ranger
---
&gt;We&amp;#39;re reducing the recharge on Allies&amp;#39; Aid in PvE only since we feel it is sufficiently powerful in competitive modes already.
---
&gt;- Soften the Fall: Fall damage functionality has been removed from this trait. This trait has been renamed Child of Earth.
---
&gt;- Allies&amp;#39; Aid: This trait no longer increases revival speed. This trait&amp;#39;s cooldown has been reduced from 85 seconds to 60 seconds in PvE only. Fixed a bug that caused the version of &amp;quot;Search and Rescue!&amp;quot; associated with this trait to be considered a shout skill instead of a command.
---
&gt;- Crippling Talon: Fixed a visual bug.
---
&gt;### Revenant
---
&gt;We&amp;#39;re bumping up the range on some of Ventari&amp;#39;s Legendary Centaur Stance skills in this update to make it a little easier to affect your allies with them.
---
&gt;- Coalescence of Ruin: Fixed a bug that allowed this skill to hit foes that were out of the line of sight.
---
&gt;- Ventari&amp;#39;s Will: Increased the radius of this skill from 180 to 240.
---
&gt;- Protective Solace: Increased the radius of this skill from 180 to 240.
---
&gt;- Planar Protection: Fall damage functionality has been removed from this trait.
---
&gt;### Thief
---
&gt;We released a hotfix for Deadly Ambition for PvP in November, but in this update we&amp;#39;re addressing the issue with a more comprehensive and functional change to refocus the trait on control over its usage rather than being a very passive damage increase.
---
&gt;- Uncatchable: Fall damage functionality has been removed from this trait.
---
&gt;- Deadly Ambition: This trait now applies 1 stack of poison for 3 seconds when striking with a dual-wield attack. This effect has no cooldown but can only occur once per dual-wield attack use. This trait is no longer split between game modes.
---
&gt;### Warrior
---
&gt;Along with the removal of falling damage effects and readjustment of Peak Performance, we are also removing a requirement from Sundering Mace that we felt was superfluous.
---
&gt;- Peak Performance: Fall damage functionality has been removed from this trait. This trait now grants a baseline of 5% bonus damage in PvE and 3% bonus damage in competitive modes. The additional damage output gained from using physical skills has been reduced from 20% to 15% in PvE and 10% to 7% in competitive modes.
---
&gt;- Sundering Mace: This trait no longer requires the target to be vulnerable in order to activate the control duration bonus.
---
&gt;## PvP Changes
---
&gt;- Sigil of Agility: Reduced quickness duration from 2 seconds to 1 second in PvP only.
---
&gt;- Elixir U: Reduced stability duration from 6 seconds to 1 second in PvP only.
---
&gt;- Kinetic Battery: Reduced quickness duration from 5 seconds to 3 seconds in PvP only.
---
&gt;- Photon Wall: Increased cooldown from 35 seconds to 45 seconds in PvP only.

---
&gt;- Illusionary Counter: Reduced the number of clones created from 2 to 1 in PvP only
---
&gt;- Phantasmal Warlock: Reduced the number of warlocks summoned from 2 to 1 in PvP only. Increased the vulnerability applied per hit from 2 stacks to 4 stacks in PvP only.
---
&gt;- Chaos Vortex: Reduced bleed duration from 8 seconds to 4 seconds in PvP only. Reduced burn duration from 2 seconds to 1 second in PvP only. Reduced torment duration from 8 seconds to 4 seconds in PvP only.
---
&gt;- Chaotic Dampening: Fixed a bug that prevented this trait from reducing the recharge of Lesser Chaos Storm.
---
&gt;- Warrior&amp;#39;s Cunning: Reduced damage bonus against targets above 90% health from 25% to 7% in PvP only. Reduced damage bonus against targets with barrier from 50% to 10% in PvP only.
---
&gt;- Rampage: Some Rampage skills have been adjusted as follows:

&gt;  - Kick: Power coefficient has been reduced from 1.2 to 0.01 in PvP only.
---
&gt;  - Throw Boulder: Power coefficient has been reduced from 2.0 to 0.01 in PvP only.
---
&gt;  - Seismic Leap: Power coefficient has been reduced from 1.6 to 0.01 in PvP only.
---
&gt;## WvW Changes

&gt;- Sand Savant: This trait no longer increases the target cap of shade skills in WvW only.
---
&gt;- Devouring Darkness (from Lingering Curse): Reduced the number of boons corrupted from 2 to 1 in WvW only.
---
&gt;## Structured Player vs. Player
---
&gt;- Updated the background for the Icebrood Saga Reward Track.
---
&gt;## World vs. World
---
&gt;## BLACK LION TRADING COMPANY GEM STORE
---
&gt;### New Items and Promotions
---
&gt;- The new Emblazoned Cape is now available in the Style category of the Gem Store for 500 gems.
---
&gt;- The new Dreamwalker Dagger is now available in the Style category of the Gem Store for 600 gems.
---
&gt;- For a limited time, the Infinite Volatile Magic Gathering Tools are available in the Utility category of the Gem Store for 2,700 gems.
---
&gt;- For a limited time, the Mount Adoption License returns to the Gem Store at a discounted price of 320 gems—a savings of 20%.
---
You can get a basic one from guild traders
---
10 minutes later - 90% of playerbase - why the fuck did I buy it?
---
seems like she has a pretty flexible art style between the brush-stroke MtG and fantasy-esque concepts as well as the more hard-lined mechs.  serves the vast array of GW2 looks quite well i'd say.
---
Edna is disappointed now...
---
The capes came out of nowhere.
---
&gt; Some Looking for Group categories have been reorganized for better readability. 
---
It's Happening!!!
---
This is amazing. A lot of weapons clip badly when stowed, and this change opens up a lot more options for those of use who are obsessive about clipping.
---
Even to legendary backpacks huh? Well aint that amazing?
---
If you think it's because of the server, check for other servers. Even servers that like desert bl, its generally the worst and least active map. Not by abit but by a large margin. It's bad by every measurement except for this subreddit and the pve players that thinks it looks great. Unfortunately their opinion is irrelevant when it comes to people playing the game.
---
If it feels alive and well populated. It IS alive and well populated. Anything else than that would be or dead, or crowded.
---
Because why update old content when you can sell new skins.
---
Of course its in gem store
---
*GUILD CAPE AVAILABLE FOR COMMENDATIONS. NOT GEMSTORE EXCLUSIVE.*
---
So I guess capes will be the new genstore chairs, that were the new gemstone mount skins, that were the new gemstore gliders.
---
Not really, but I just have a sense after you were compelled to respond to a snide remark with a snide remark, then respond to neutral replies with more snide remarks, then saying this is kindergarten shit while engaging in kintergarten shit, then say you enjoy my "snide" remarks to pretend to be on the high ground while say I'm pretending to be on the high ground. It's sort of a weird lack of self-awareness that prompted me.
---
So it's more of empathy for someone who uses throwaway accounts and trolling as a means of justice and self-fulfilment. I've been there and it's sad.
---

---
Until nearly all non-average designs go into the gem store.
---
I think Fashion Wars got the biggest buff from this patch.
---
I've been on an empty map when meta started and I can vouch for the fact that the bombers actually do damage. If you can't destroy the bomb in time the shrine takes damage, and 2-3 people per shrine is not enough to destroy the bombs before they explode.
---
Perhaps the bombers could be invulnerable and/or the bombs do more damage so they're more of a meaningful threat.
---
I do agree that the first part of the meta is way too long though.
---
[don't get your hopes up](https://i.imgur.com/A6h7Ich.png)

it's not some majestic, flowing cloak.  it's a stiff, oversized, backwards bib
---
I like the skeleton hands coming out of the ground. Nice details.
---
That would be cool actually, if we Merchandise Collector didn't exist or the helmet wasn't as rare.
---
uuh, I think you might have  replied to the wrong post.
---
There needs to be at least one spot in the game where you get sucked into an engine if you are wearing a cape...

---
&gt;Mount Adoption License—30% Off
---
Patchnotes&amp; ingame shop says 20%
---
Yes my point exactly. A nice free basic one with limited dye channels and minimal effect/size and then every 2 weeks or month there will be a new Cape design on sale with different dye patterns,  different effects and even different lengths, widths and animations. 
---
I.e the new chair, that was the new mount skin, that was the new glider lol
---
*all designs past this first guild cape that aren't direct upgrades
---
There’s only two so fa, relax
---
Dat music. So pretty and happy.
---
There are a number of third party retailers that are authorized, though, and there is no harm in using them...
---
You should probably look up what spaghetti coder actaully is and how it happens, and how it especially happens to old games. It simply is not always something that can be sorted out because the smallest change effect so many things in so many game modes..
---
*Edna wants to know your location...*
---
Capes are kinda meh. It still clips with everything, so they just made it go far, far away from your back and it looks pretty dumb. Animation is fairly stiff too. 
---
I'm more interested in dyeable backpieces thing. They have the technology now.
---
Weird. It's telling my friend it requires Heart of Thorns and is showing locked on the store. They got Path of Fire after it came bundled with HoT.
---
Do the capes flap in the wind when you are on your mounts?
---
Huh, it looks fine in the preview window.
---
yes :)
---
They have guild capes too for gold and commendations!
---
They had technical difficulties due to charrs' anatomy. So they couldn't put them until now due to them clipping hard...and it wasn't probably a really pressing matter, so it was probably postponed many times.
---
They only added the guild one because all of the gw1 old timers would instantly quit if they didn't. It's gliders all over again, where we never get any other skins attainable in game except for rare situations that have been abandoned.
---
I really like hiding the stowed weapons.
---
Low viewership can be indicative of the state of a game. Twitch viewership for many games results in direct exposure for said games which results in more new players being drawn to those games because good/entertaining streamers are also playing them. Having a twitch presence would aid in marketing this game as arenanet are known for their exceptionally poor in-house marketing tactics. Promotions, sponsorships, community building; it all results in increased revenue and attention for both stramers and the game.
---
 **Build and Equipment Templates last used in PvE, WvW, and PvP will now be remembered, and they will be automatically activated when returning to that game mode.** 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Don't care about capes
---
The basic one looks like a bed sheet.
---
Druid isn't good for Fractals anymore.  Go watch Rheyo's Firebrand guide that was posted to the subreddit today.  Firebrand has a ton more defensive utility than Druid does.  It can stagger time spent inside any of its F1-F3 tomes because it isn't limited to 9 seconds of CA, provide Quickness in addition to might as well as heaps of stability, reflects, condition cleanses, resistance...  Chrono/Druid really just isn't good inside of FoTM anymore.  It's usable, but not desirable.
---
I get the nostalgia but it's just another backpack  skin.
---
Finally someone who actaully understand what spaghetti code is and why most games struggle with such after several years and it is somthing you simply just can not fix. 
---
At this point Reddit horde throw words around without realise the meaning of it trying to fit their purpose.
---
That guild emblem tho
---
Imagine they would've gone the weapon's route. Have capes as traditional drops, and funky ones for the gemstore. Looks like it's going to be more like chairs. A few pity capes via ingame means, and the rest is gemstore.
---
NCSoft really seems to have decided what way their want to go with GW2.
---
If Mordremoth could attack the cotton farms in the Grove...
---
Can someone post me a link of the two new capes? Can't check them out rn. Thanks in advance!
---
In fact those complaining are also those who don't care at all about cosmetics, the only source of the studio income and their sole focus at the moment.
---
I can imagine the fight between the rewards team and the monetization team to decide what gets the long cape.
---
Wheeled office chairs, bicycle helmets, taped cardboard tubes as jousting lances... a good ol' classic office joust.
---
The rewards team lost, obviously.
---
2000 to 3000 kills difference on 22k total is more than 10% of total kills. For borders which are typically around 20% as eb takes the lion share that's half the activity.
---
You're advocating for eotm in wvw. Frankly I should have called you a monkey too dumb to reason with a while ago. Because truthfully that's what this proposal is xD
---
CAPES?! In my GW??
---
Everything looks bad on Charr though
---
Ingame money equals free in my book.
---
Just a shame capes are gonna be another gem store item and we might get lucky if they release some more legendary back items.
---
almost perfect...
---
Just reorder content from newest to oldest...
---
This is just shitty Basic cape. You Will see very cool one being gemstore or Black luon chest exclusive in future.
---
And remove the 3 categories at the bottom.
---
 "A towel, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy says, is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have."
---
That would be Incredible.
---

---
* Fractals
---
* Raids
---
* Strike Missions
---
would've felt more natural, no?
---
You're probably right, but even so, this is not an expansion feature. We didn't pay $40 to get the ability to use capes like we did gliders or mounts. They could've very easily locked all of these behind the gem store, including the basic one, and it wouldn't really be out of character for their business practices... but they didn't. I'm glad they didn't.
---
 Black Lion Industry Contract... probably LS5 Contract huh?
---
Because Anet told you that?
---
MM necro, yay!
---
As mentioned in the notes and other comments, you can get them with 10 guild commendations plus 10 gold.

It's clearly in order of active development to dead

Oh, thats good.
---
This is a pretty fantastic patch just from the quality of life they're introducing. I can definitely see all of those being really useful.
---
And again game is moving towards a single player kind of playstyle .
---
Funny thing is the patch caused the achievements to reset as well. Might be fixed but undocumented maybe?
---
Can't do them since I did them earlier today.
---
Hm. Same amount as glider or mount skins.
---
Thank you :D
---
Wow, this is the most positive reddit has been about an update. 
---
Seriously though, these are way more changes then I expected and am more then suprised! Dynamic hud sounds cool, am excited to try it out when I get home. It was one of the few reasons why I used ArcDPS. 
---
Native DPS meter coming soon maybe?
---
Oooh, I'm not into capes but hopefully this means someday we might get cloaks. Would be nice for going further north.

I'm liking the designated PoF, HoT, Lw3, lw4. I've always been annoyed scrolling through.

---
Surprised it hasn't blown up yet. WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS SINCE 2012.
---
So just group them all together?
---
6 open world categories... when they could have just collapsed sub-section into expansions and seasons similar to core maps instead of pushing everything else further down. it's really not that hard.
---
because their last few years of monetization have shown that.
---
I'd argue that this is an expansion feature. We've been asking for this for years, hell it was in gw1 in much better capacity (the guild cape didn't look like a burlap sack, and you could get different styles through actual difficult content and achievements). They have to provide a basic version for most people to not cry that the new glamor slot is inaccessible, but it's gimped compared to the obviously superior gem store version.
---
NSFW language (the Mathil1 part at the beginning, I dunno if the later clips touch on it) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s22liD_nrpw
---
Honestly, anyone who watched or was generally following exilecon on twitch or reddit was aware of the negative effect twitchdrops had on the event.
---
No, you are too. Promoting and defending this behavior is in no way acceptable. Pretending low rated players play only among bots and afks is dishonest. It's where new players end up - in this incredibly toxic environment that you yourself advocate for and promote -. And the bots aren't in bronze - btw. 
---
You have no idea about PvP and yet you pretend you do. You advocate things that ruin the experience of anyone trying to play it competitively or seriously. You state they aren't to blame and at no point did you consider anyone who doesn't play like a carebear. 
---
If you weren't a toxic casual - you'd have stated things along the lines of you can farm an ascended weapon in PvP at any rating as long as you play. However afking harms all other players in your game and should be avoided. But that's not what you advocate - because you're a toxic person who clearly dislikes any competitive playstyles. 
---
I don't care how nicely you dress up your words. Your actions and the things you state are clearly toxic to anyone who isn't hypercasual. You continuously do this in your posts without realising it. Yet when others are toxic or elitist towards casuals you cry and reeeee all day. That's why you're a hypocrite / clueless / not so bright :). And toxic of course.

Able to hide the minimap, my mind is now in peace.
---
cats...always breaking things
---
I mean, it is great to have something positive about the game, but I couldn't think of any use for it.   There are only two "dynamic" conditions, in and out oif the combat, and every UI element is kinda needed in both cases. Maybe you can disable "rewards" and "menu bar" (which is tiny anyway) in combat? Is that it? Why is there so much packed into "objectives"?
---
I wish they made a keybind that would allow you to switch between few presets on will, that would be somewhat useful.
---
Or couldn't they just make a side panel with few customiable buttons instead? The ones WoW had  15+ years ago, where you could put  items from your inventory and such. They could even sell them similarly to shared inventory slots. That would be a real UI improvement.
---
Frozen pizza is just not the same....
---
Aw yiss. Here comes all the Superman and other superhero cosplays.
---
This revolutionises the Asura fashion endgame, 99% of staves and greatswords clip through their heads when stowed.
---
Also a big RP buff for all those weapons that are immaterial and make no sense when stowed, like the Phantasmal weapons.
---
Is this a freebie?? Their post doesn't say if it's for sale or how many gems. I realize it's in the gem store so probably an $$ item but it doesn't specific.
---
This is nice, so many quallity of life changes that have been annoying for years and years, relly nice!
---
If a noob do this in other games he would be punished, because it's toxic and griefing. He is to blame. So are you for continuing to promote it. :)
---
I'm sorry. Can someone explain to me what's going on here? Why is this a class specific thing?
---
Cape, knowing the game it will float in the air, push the weapon in your back 2 meters away from you.  
---
Edit, it does
---
You didn't notice the memes and hype in the last few days?
---
I don't think it's sarcasm
---
It's a newly added, 7-year+ requested feature being added to the game, unannounced prior to its live implementation. That's not an appropriate use of the word "surprise?"
---
Again. Whatever the game is moving towards is ok to me. I do not think is going maintenance mode.  They just added capes they patched many issue just today but even if it was this way and this is the state it will maintain forever is ok to me and many many other ppl . I'd say most of the player base. Remember every decision they make is data driven. They know who plays, how much and how. If they decide this is ok is because most player like it. We are ruining your game ? Sorry. Really. It sucks but is a game which is going better and better for those who like to play this way
---
I like this change but I really really really don't get their problem with having a menu with more than 2 levels of hierarchy.
---
I really wonder what the hell the gemstore is for.  
---
At this point it either shovels billions of money or nothing at all because everything is so darn overpriced
---
What you say is clearly advocating afking in ranked for personal rewards, a practise considered griefing in most if not all competitive games, in RANKED PVP. 
---
Clearly, it's toxic and does ruin the experience for anyone trying to play competitively. Just because YOU think nobody should be playing gw2 competitively. That is again, why you are a toxic casual and a carebear.
---
Now they just need to let us hide at least the chest piece so we can actually see tattoos, skin patterns and more of the skin infusions.
---
Eles swapped attunements instead of weapons, now they can do both (out of combat)
---
No?
---
I can no longer double click to swap weapons from inventory between 3 weapon sets WOW! amazing update. Too bad OOC 2nd set is fucking useless.
---
Well, maybe do some work on your guild logo to make it look better then.
---
This is an anomalously good update.
---
I don't even think the gemstore one can display the guild icon. I've seen two players in two different guilds wearing it and no icon was shown.
---
I came
---
Everybody is keeping their distance from sylvari after HoT.
---
Because all functionality has been moved to other menus, the old PvP Build/Equipment panel has been retired.
---
WHAT? NO. NO. NO. DONT MAKE ME USE YOUR STUPID TEMPLATES. DAFUQ.
---
Did Dragon stand late night just a few weeks ago. Map was full so i am sure there was at least one other map too. 
---
All though i can say that NA have less activity on the lfg-tool and are in a much worse spot when it comes to WvW then EU so maybe that is the problem?
---
You must have the lowest expectations on Earth.
---
Can't say I blame em. Never know what those Mordrem are up to.
---
Yeah Tomes can be a tough choice. I mainly use these in 'emergency' scenarios, I try not to burn them too much unless its for a specific encounter.   
---
My first ever experience with Healbrand was actually a part of a zerg in WvW, and I remember the commander saying that when you're using a tome, avoid using your mantras. Although its a different game mode, that always rings in my head and translates fairly nice in PvE. Your Tomes are small, but strong, bursts of power (in what the specialize in of course, F1 = Burning, F2 = Heals, F3 = Stability/Damage Mitigation) so it's not a bad idea to save your Mantra charges while in Tomes for the most part, you always need to keep your cooldowns in mind.  
---
Also one thing I can't believe I forgot to mention in the video is the golden rule of Mantra's, never use the final Charge (unless you absolutely have to of course.) The reason being is that cooldown is super long, and the channel time to recharge the mantra makes you useless for about 3 seconds (1.5ish with quickness) which in high pressure situations can make or break the fight.   
---
As for your heal mantra, try not to use this down to 1 chage frequently, this isn't as important to put down on 1 charge as it is your potence mantra. This is to give a low-duration Aegis proc to avoid a big hit, so timing with this ability is pretty crucial. Yes you may want to top up Quickness every 7 seconds when running liberator's vow, but in a typical situation you should have at least 2 charges on the ready for upcoming mechanics.
---
Ah, to remember the day that revenant was released... good times
---
wow thats awful, how is that in the game????
---
Because their cape was too long and it tripped them up.
---
Oh I appreciate all the emoticons but if u do not see that you are just delusional . And we are not pushing actually I am not pushing anyone anywhere . I just play my game and do not ask for any change... ( Well if they could remove raid as a whole I'll be happy ... It will happen in 2020 let's hope) 
---
Relax mate not me nor you decide anything about the future of this game. I just got luck o changed in 7 years and game changed according to my playstyle. 
---
I could be in your position and game could have been switching to hardcore and I'd be felling abandoned . 
---
Just luck
---
Some classes have only been able to equip one weapon set at a time since launch because allowing a second weapon set would give access to far too many skills during a fight. Those classes had to open the hero panel and switch out their equipped weapons while out of combat. Now they can have them equipped and do a 1 button swap while out of combat.
---
Ye other games . If my grandpa had 3 balls she'd be a flipper
---
Math checks out.
---
That's a lot of UI.
---
HEY, MY CHARR IS THE EMBODIMENT OF RAP, IT IS ABSOLUTE PERFECTION, INCLUDING THE SEIZURE CAPE.
---
&gt;This revolutionises the Asura fashion endgame, 99% of staves and greatswords clip through their heads when stowed.
---
It also fixes a lot of the annoyances of specific weapon sets. For example, pistols have a really bad tendency to "float" next to the hip depending on the body type of the character.
---
&gt;Also a big RP buff for all those weapons that are immaterial and make no sense when stowed, like the Phantasm weapons.
---
I'm glad you mentioned this. A big part of why I've disliked weapon swap all these years is because of how weird a stowed weapons look when I swap them out-of-combat.
---
&gt;capes? I like that its in the guild hall at least
---
Capes were pretty big in gw1 so people have been asking for them since release.
---
Second set can hold bloodlust sigil. You keep stacks of it in combat with other weapons in active slot.
---
Never said you should not play competitive. I think is pointless but as I write if u like good for you. But being platinum or bronze reward the same.
---
So if i play the game during late night EU and never had a issue EVER to find a populated map in the lfg-tool how is this exscuses? 
---
The issue usually are that people don't use the lfg-tool. When they do they should not have problems to find active maps.
---
They can totally make the guild one upgradeable in the mystic forge with objects you obtain via guild comms to bring some attention back to guild missions.
---
Intere3
---
I can finally die in peace.
---
Good thing i saved like 12 commendations back from the days when guilds where a thing :D
---
This us **HUGE**.
---
preparing the game for maintenance mode
---
It still looks like trash.
---
&gt; Anet: For engineers, we plan to put grenade barrage on healing skills.
---
&gt; feedback: that's terrible for all those reasons: &lt;list&gt;
---
&gt; Anet: We listened to your feedback; we plan to put grenade barrage on healing skills
---
&gt; feedback: Thanks for listening, but you must have missed this: putting an offensive skill on something like healing makes terrible game play for all those reasons: &lt;list&gt;
---
&gt; Anet: We listened to your feedback, and enjoy your capes!
---
Season 2 was the best when it came to cohesive storytelling imo
---
by no means am i defending capes, just highlighting that charr naturally have the short end of the stick when it comes to cosmetics.
---
all of our backpacks float, so it's only logical that capes do too (as to not get in the way of our cosmetics that'll never be bulky enough to clip anyway but i digress). 
---
everything is distorted to fit a non-typical quadruped body plan, so textures naturally look janky or just generally ass
---
etc
---
we've had this for years.
---
&gt;Native DPS meter coming soon maybe?
---
We have one in the training instance of the Aerodrome. That's probably as close as we'll ever get for a native dps meter.
---
Not really.  We don't have to be happy with minimal effort.
---
They coulda put more effort into it to deliver quality, but they don't.  Nobody shitting on the fact they are here, just the fact the in-game one looks like one of those bibs you get at crab/BBQ places than a nice cape.
---
That's a legitimate critisim.
---
You bet I am a care Bear. I stopped serious pvp since I ranked in wow for the mount and played on a PvP server. Ty bye nevermore . Should feel offended? It is just not my kind of game. 
---
What are you 13 that you think avoiding fight is something wrong ? 
---
I play to relax so ye I avoid combat. I have no time to waste .
---
And yes I am a casual.
---
Toxic means nothing
---
This cape is white and longer than the average cloak or cape.
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.
---
You want some of that sweet Reddit Karma?
---
Charr were built for the battle-banners tbh. suits their body type better.
---
That's the legendary cape that physically transforms, just like the armor!
---
I can play now, but, the change of Build Template autoswitch in wvw/pvp/pve does require me to have each build 'saved' in the template bank? 
---
Or does it work like it used to?
---
After 7 (SEVEN) fucking years I can finally remove the monstrosity from my left corner, oh lawdy this needs a celebration 🎉
---
Well, there are 3 legendary backpieces that give you a glider skin.
---
I lurk here pretty actively - can you link me to a meme or hype post about this from the last few days?
---
UI updates!
---
Friends, they're finally here! 
---
BLESSED UI UPDATES!
---
2019: in 2019, we got build templates and capes!
---
2013,14,15,16,17,18: Wow! I'm so jealous!!! 
---
2019: yep. 😬 living the dream.
---
Thanks for the explanation.
---
Wish there were "show on mouse-over" option, though.
---
The new dagger looks better than both legendary dagger skins.
---
It's one button next to your headpiece.
---
[https://www.twitch.tv/woodenpotatoes/clip/DistinctAmazingKoupreyTBTacoRight](https://www.twitch.tv/woodenpotatoes/clip/DistinctAmazingKoupreyTBTacoRight)
---
This patch deserves my money.
---
So, after well over a year, I will give you money ANet...and no, it's not because of capes.
---
upcoming?
---
So, now I can switch between HOPE/HOPE to Quip/Quip. Why should I want to do that?
---
Think it's fixed, was there always a UI telling you if you want to do it a 2nd time or wait till reset?
---
They look like BIBS lmaOooooo
---
not to be negative, but isn't dynamic meaning you can place part of the UI where you want it and fully edit every part of the UI you want?
---
Like I want targeted hp bar right above my skillbar, have the options icons all in the left bottom corner and go vertically etc..
---
Isn't this just static UI with the option to hide stuff you don't need?
---
I’m so proud of this community.
---
&gt;  won't be applicable to other back items
---
for new ones - maybe, for old ones? not a chance
---
From the [blog post](*While we cannot add dye channels to existing backpieces, keep an eye out for dyeable backpacks of different styles in the future!)
---
/thread
---
A stepping stone in to learning about raids. So how many times do we read posts on reddit about players who are not able to do mechanics in raids or fractals or even the old dungeons. They fail, they die and they don't do dps or understand CC bars. 
---
So now we got a instance for people to prepare what they should expect out of the combat in instances. Isn't that exactly what this game needed? I mean just the fact that so many players have no clue what a break bar even is because noone ever showed that in the game. And here they even get a special key for it. 
---
So maybe this is exactly what we needed to make those players trying it out and realise that it is not that hard and you just need to learn to move and cc.
---
is that fix also gonna make capes actually lay on charr back instead of floating above it like pauldrons do?
---
You can keep a stacking sigil on one set now like the rest of the classes.
---
That "pity" cape is a Guild Cape, which is what people have been asking for. People will always find reasons to complain I guess
---
I'm afraid that moment might have been somewhere between abandoning dungeons to their fate and LS2 story events being totally instanced content.
---
Its not alwaays about size you know..? 
---
It is, but its a different cut entirely. I'd probably favour it if I could afford it rn.   
---
\+It's called "basic", so I imagine we'll get upgradable options here, which sounds great and offers a reason to play guild stuff
---
already too late
---
&gt;because all of the gw1 old timers would instantly quit if they didn't
---
Hopefully those have stopped torturing themselves and have left long ago.
---
it's a mini rollback. generally that is a safety measure to prevent data corruption when something goes wrong. you might want to run a -repair on your client.
---
Thats a brand new sentence
---
Halleluja!
---
I whoud rather see some custom lfg. at least half of these are always empty and without any real purpose.
---
Guild Capes, finally! (except I havent had a guild in like 5 years)
---
Nah, someone has to pay real money to get those gems into the game, even if you personally only pay in gold.  
---
And while buying something for gold is technically free I personally won't give every ingame transaction my approval by default. The company deliberately tunes their game to incentivize MTX so the "you can buy it for gold" argument isn't the bulletproof argument some people think it is.
---
Let's way
---
 No hurry
---
Or they can expand the map.
---
It's not fully customizable, but you can make it so certain parts appear or disappear based on if you're in combat or not.
---
the living world under central tyria, what is it for?
---
Its painfully clear when people who dont know the mechanics fake KP. I can easily tell who fakes just from the ping of KP half the time. It's usually an even straight number like 60 or 75 which is a big tell (some are legit) or they join a 50+ group without LNHB, had one guy ping over 175 with no title, he was asking to not GG for a run at his title. Its true no one really cares as long as you can kill it in one swing but it's still incredibly rampant and is a joke at best to ask for much more than 50 + LNHB. That's around a month straight of CMs.
---
Now I want this to happen :/
---
Best QoL update in a long time ! But it arrives way too late for many vets who have already quit or are not interested anymore in that (great) game..
---
&gt; Those classes had to open the hero panel 
---
The far easier route is 'open inventory' -&gt; double click.
---
That's an extreme view, but one I get pushed closer and closer to each time I see the salt in this sub.
---
Supposing ANet pushes the red button and wipes out PvP and WvW, and puts raids in the same "you can still do them but they're unsupported content" box as dungeons...what then?
---
A huge overnight shit storm, but they weather that for a few months and once the dust settles, where's it leave them: the largest demographic of the loudest haters and worst press get the boot they finally needed to walk the walk and actually quit playing. This group includes very few of the "whales" that form their income base in the gem store, and the move turns away very few newbies and casuals, who are coming for open world.
---
The game more accurately reflects the casual, easy niche that the game has already aimed itself at anyway, and now has less in the way of rewards that are walled off to those players unless they do competitive gaming. Relevant rewards that used to require these modes are now available in exchange for some combination of laurels, karma, gold, and various other in game currency (for instance, I could see a GoB being sold for maybe 50g, and half a million karma).
---
Honestly, other than the immediate fallout following the decision, I don't see too much in the way of lasting negative consequences, and in terms of positives, it eliminates a lot of the toxicity we see now, frees up some manpower, and narrows the focus of the team.
---
This is true in some cases but keep responding like that. Keep pushing people who could support the game away. That’s a good idea.
---
You pretend bots are only in bronze yet most bots are rated higher than your top rank. What can I say XD
---
Nope, map endeeld with Vabbi/Kourna border.
---
How so?
---
I'm gonna' guess two by the end of Season 5. There will be a big fluffy fur cloak and a fancy icy cloak at some point in the season, probably one on the same episode we get the new penguin mount.
---
That's the gw2 salt mine mentality: no matter the news, find a way to be bitter about it.
---
It was on the map when they expanded the world map. You just couldn't go down that far South in-game till Istan got released IIRC. It was "leaked" in the gamefiles.
---
Do you have a link by any chance? Currently at work
---
lol after all these years, anet finally caved on capes.
---
Oh really? Good to hear!
---
There's the chance that they might not be able to add more levels to it. There are several aspects of the UI that haven't received updates in years because of how badly it was coded at the original release. They've admitted that they can't update the map to show world completion with newer zones taken into account because of how badly patched together the system is. The same might apply here.
---
Hopefully it’s still at least somewhat satisfying, though. They could probably add a more punchy sound effect that can only be heard by the player levelling up.
---
They look like a crust rug on your back. Where are the cloth physics :(
---
Of course it's a fucking gemstore item. Fuck off.
---
It's probably related to how leveling up deals a tiny amount of damage and inflicts knockback to everything around you.
---
The data has always been there, but it just hasn't been posted on reddit much before. As for discounts, it could happen on items that already are on gem store, like for Choya or Firefly mining tool, but that's not something we can see. Can only see when items are coming to gem store and when they are going.
---
Small addition to that: Revenant (the third heavy profession) is also only available when you buy the expansion. So you have only access to 8 out of 9 core professions on a F2P account.
---
**HOLY FUCK WE HAVE CAPES**
---
The question is: Will we be getting a cape glider? Superman style.
---
Is it really necessary to explain that the hiring decisions of the art department have no bearing on the hiring decisions of other departments, and that understaffing the art department would not do anything to improve the game?
---
for LS season 1, what else?
---
 Now these are the cloth physics I was looking for
---
Also, the drop down menu for accessing sigils and amulets is now twice as big, making it less of a hassle to find that sigil you need.
---
CAPE
---
If you build 25 stacks of a stat bonus with the weapon equipped then swap weapon sets, you keep the stacks when you swap as long as you don't unequip.
---
Native opt-in character inspect would be cool too
---
You trying to be Dr. Strange?
---
Anyone else having the problem where the cape appears to be 20 miles away from the actual back of the character?
---
[http://puu.sh/ELpEN/dd63b8ddb4.jpg](http://puu.sh/ELpEN/dd63b8ddb4.jpg)
---
True enough, but either way it not ideal compared to one key press.
---
na bullying eu again absolutely abhorrent. did ur mom teach nothing?
---
I also like them, even tho I am not 100% on board with the implementation of Strike Missions. I said it already 3 years ago when Arena Net delayed a raid wing for the first time because the Voice Actors were not available (or some other quality shit) Scale them down. We don't need scripted events and perfect voice acting on every bit of content. And with Strike missions they finally did. So good for them.
---
Please separate Personal story at least! I'd love to turn it off on all my characters I have no plans on doing that on.
---
Which makes the basic one you can buy with guild commendations earned from doing guild missions what, exactly?
---
This is definitely a step in the right direction but feels more like a band-aid fix than a real usability change. Some thoughts on what would make this a lot better:
---
* When opening a drop down you should immediately be placed in the first sub-section. This is especially good for those sections that only have 1 entry (role-play, etc.). 
---
* Probably should just remove mentoring altogether. Unless I'm mistaken and people actually use it. 
---
* Different icons for Festivals and Story Journal to be distinct from Map LFG's. 
---
* Have more layers of hierarchy - seriously. All Map LFG's should fall under a map section. Competitive stuff under another. Group PvE under a third (include story missions in here probably, maybe festivals as well). These tabs can then be larger when there are fewer of them. 3 levels of hierarchy does not hurt anybody, an overly sprawled 2-level one does (looking at you too, Achievement Panel). 
---
* Alternative to deeper hierarchies would be to have search and filter functions and allow players to select map(s) their LFG is tied to when creating a group. This would probably be the best solution but the most resource-heavy.
---
Would be cool to also get a full-length Guild Cape down the line, tho. More options is GOOD.
---
Ya know.. the excuse for no capes has always been that they won't work with Charr..      
---
You effing Charr ruin things for everyone constantly...    
---
So naturally a charr would immediatly come post and complain about the visual glitch..
---
They wrote it's a different type of back item, it's not a backpack anymore :D
---
Yikes that looks awful..
---
I've never been asked, neither has any of my guildies, one is nearing 500 ess and we have lots over 100 ess. I'm calling BS, titles are bought and ess is easily faked (I've faked mine a ton) but you can very quickly see a bad player in Skovard.
---
Clever thinking as gliding isn’t exactly Superman or Thor flying!
---
To avoid clipping with the tail.
---
For that, you would want a Superman cape that makes your Skyscale and Griffon invisible.
---
sounds good doesn't work
---
Read it again.  They cut down on the \*visual\* noise of it.  You still have to be driven into a homicidal rage by the audio.
---
"we read your feedback, look, we did what you want, now give us more money!"
---
What do you mean that it doesn't work? Like, the feature is broken, or it doesn't do what you're expecting?
---
What shoulder is that?
---
its new, since they updated the icon
---
It's new -  late patchnotes: [https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/1109792#Comment\_1109792](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/1109792#Comment_1109792)
---
One they are a business anyone who thought they wouldn't monetise capes when they added them I really want your optimism. Two like build templates for years people have asked for them saying they would pay gems for them and yet when they actually do that people act as if Anet has ignored them. As ever if you don't like it don't buy it.
---
You picked a charr to demonstrate the quality of a skin…
---
holy cow -how noone of us could see this comming? ... who would guest that anet isnt charity, but is actuall company who do it for money? And we all doing our real life work for free, not like this bad bad capitalist pigs - cause thats how it works, isnt it? 
---
man..or woman..are you for real?
---
wow, they dont want you to miss anything huh!
---
They can monetize the shit out of capes for all i care, just don't monetize so aggressively build templates, to the point its not even worth it to buy them, just buy new char slots. ffs.
---
We're free to have differing opinions.
---
A business that cares about money? Gasp!
---
because it looks normal on 4 other races.
---
It's because they made the sights and sounds of people toming up new alts less intrusive, right?
---
Also:  Holy shit.  Back items with dye channels.  Mind blown again.
---
Same. On my alt, I'm locked out from buying it despite having owned the expansions for six or seven weeks. On my main, I can buy it.
---
Funny how everyone was up in arms about them monetising build templates and now everyone is okay to shill? Interesting.
---
Funny, I already regret my purchase. 
---
Now that I have a cape after 7 years of wait, I find it kind of crappy. It clips with your stowed 2h weapons and a quiver or backpack look better on most of my characters.
---
Oh well, it's not like I still need the gold.
---
When is this larger competitive-focused patch happening they’re talking about?
---
make ryan bring 4 conjures too pls
---
fyi: my alt account which only has pof (+free hot) also cannot buy certain items marked as "requires HoT". something with the free HoT seems to not work with the store properly
---
QoL features and skins are two different things.
---
seeing as how Jormag's awakening drove the norn and kodan further south way back when it's probable that Jormag's domain is further north than the current map.  Whether or not Jormag's domain is expanding like how Kralk was with the Brand I think is still tbd.
---
ninja style gliding? :D
---
Assnet is a joke.
---
Le gem!
---
It's very nice but it could have more options, like for example show menu on mouseover or separate tracker, like I would like to see events but not dailies for example
---
i hope the text "future bigger update for competitive formats" will be not just a saying - and i hope even more that wvw will get a slice of this too.  
---
outside of that, nice update.
---
I think it's their response to people that want to know about promotions without opening gemstore screen every day. I'd prefer a wishlist honestly.
---
Why not just make it a permanent novelty?
---
Never said that . Quote me plese
---
Didn't know the Fellowship of the ring wore hats.  :p
---
Monetize it all you want, as long as we can earn some from the game, I’m ok with it.
---
Falling traits were basically pointless. There were few fights where it was ever handy. This does free up mostly pointless traits to have other uses.
---
I'd never see sunlight again.
---
Anything at all to maintain dissatisfaction and salt. It's the r/gw2 way.
---
Sigh you do not understand
---
And I am bored 
---
 There is new content to play . Have fun
---
should be fixed now!
---
Because they're completely non-functional. Play a game with a sub fee if you don't like cosmetic microtransactions
---
conclusion you're retarded af
---
Who would have guessed &lt;&lt;Slow Clap&gt;&gt;
---
Too little, too late. Most of the players who were clamoring for them for 7 years don't play anymore and adding capes isn't going to bring a playerbase back.
---
eh i've been playing chrono lately since it has 100x more things than necro, only lacks in aoe/cleave really
---
condi mm seems very slow to kill stuff, i'd run out of patience :P
---
and yea the necro hate is real! i had complaints even if i was top dps because "you'd do even more on a better class" so ehhh...
---
Basically "we fixed something we broke earlier and listed it as a new feature"
---
Could you look into the boneskinner strike mission? https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/e584jh/the_boneskinner_seems_to_be_bugged/
---
Thats literally what i said?
---
Because its a buy to play title and anet needs the monetization model it has to keep the business sustainable.
---
Physically transforms, into a trench coat!
---
I have actually! I included it in my video on the [Alacrigade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0If9rtWUJ5o).
---
So are you gonna play gw2 or what? Cuz it’s fantastic
---
Let's be honest, though I'm happy they did something people requested for a while. And knowing that I never personally cared for this request.
---
I think it's not useful. You can't move stuff, make buff bar bigger or things like that.
---
You can only hide things that are actually necessary to play the game properly.
---
The update was barely live, there was already a guy in TD in front of the end-meta wall, asking how long it would take to open. I tell him to look at the info in the top-right corner ... He proudly hid that part. I feel it's like the story of the woman who "identifies as blind" and handicapped herself ...
---
i dont have problem with pets and templates...they go just right how i saved them
---
Actually sick. Love this option for the Spirit Weapon lookalikes to make it look like you're conjuring it whenever you pull it out rather than having them appear all the time.
---
&gt; I've been trying to do dailies for 2 gold
---
There are essentially always three easy among the 10 available, and those should be somewhere close or on top of the dailies. It's 2g for almost no time at all. The only better deal is just logging a character in, which gives you the daily login rewards, which are also worth at least a gold a day on average.
---
&gt; Also, should I do all the story content asap? (living world, hot and such).
---
There is no reason to do this asap, really. Here, just take your time and enjoy the story instead of rushing through.
---
Fractals dailies are a good way to make money from dailies, too, but the money is within Tier 4, and it will take you some time to get there. And even then, doing all T4 dalies + recs (the usual dailies) will take more than a few minutes, so it is already quite some time investment.
---
Ah, the new monetization is out. Time to see capes being thrown into the gem store constantly.
---
How are we to determine if this is an expansion feature or not, considering ANet has promised us expansion features as a part of Icebrood Saga?
---
Either this is indeed an expansion level feature and we should get more in-game access and options or it isn't...and ANet can place it largely behind their paywall, but then they don't get to claim it as part of the promised expansion features of Icebrood Saga.
---
I'd argue build templates fall into the latter category. The case functionality is there but it's totally paywall locked, so they can't really point to it and say, "Look! See! Expansion quality, as promised!" Maybe if we had 5 of each slot per alt, or the slots were a quarter of their current cost in gems...
---
:D
---
Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.
---
Which one though!
---
Maybe 1 that will completely pale in comparison to anything on the gemstore
---
U are never happy. U deserve nothing.
---
Fair enough, also agreed.
---
Balthazar of course
---
Thanks a lot :)
---
By the way would it be possible to have a cape without the guild emblem in future? Like just a flat cape (if it isn't in game already, didn't check yet)? Im in a 100% rep guild and unfortunately our logo is a pink squirrel/beaver thing... lets just say it doesnt go well with my looks.

---
anyone with the dx12 mod have their game crash?
---
Thank you very much.
---
Build templatets
---
Cosmetics
---
Lol sure.
---
Yes! Guild capes (like back in GW1) have been added along with a BLTC cape!
---
All it does is it remember which of the 3..6 tabs on the top of the Builds panel of Hero window you had active in each gamemode. Nothing else. If you actively participate in all gamemodes, you still need to have a dedicated "tab" for every gamemode, except now you won't be caught unaware because you forgot to switch your loadout before starting a pvp match or getting into a wvw fight.
---
The new META
---
It gives me some hope that the fancy guild cape will be a commendation reward...
---
this is exactly the level of irony i want directly injected into my veins
---
So wait... game isn't dying?
---
&gt;  one from 7th birthday.
---
Is it really a chair though? ... 
---
(I know it counts as one in the novelties but if a rock to stand on is a chair, I want my stappler to be a phone)
---
You get the shorter, crappier version in the guild hall.
---
This is the exact same as League of Legends's upcoming Eternals system. You get garbage ones for free or bought normally and the actually decent ones are monetized.
---
Oh is she the person who created the amazing art work for the Battletech video game? :o
---
True end game satisfaction.
---
Is there a Portal Tome for Iceborn Saga?
---
Oh is she the person who created the amazing art work for the Battletech video game?
---
&gt; There are 3 chairs from raids
---
Three? One is the Bench of the Final Judge, The Throne of Ahdashim is a second one... Which one I'm missing?
---
Could you explain why you don't use Mantra of Lore? The Regen boon it provides is strong, and it cleanses conditions instantly, including fear.
---
Seems like you could use this with Valor instead of Stand Your Ground, since you have the Elite Stability Mantra.
---
WoW also has an extensive addon support, something that lets community fix at least some of devs' fuckups.
---
ANet threatened an "addon" dev to pull the plug on one of its features, then implemented their own, paid, inferior in every way option.
---
Talk shit about Blizzard all you want - because they deserve it - but they're better *developers*.
---
Ok but these are the first 2. Be patient and they will add one as reward next living story. You'll see
---
Thanks for pointing this out, I revised my post.
---
And anyway they need money to keep server up. If u are in hurry pay
---
Especially if they're doing it very slowly and methodically, like they're actually manually double clicking the stack of tomes and then manually clicking the confirmation, slowly swinging the mouse cursor between the two like some boomer trying to figure out Facebook.
---
Courtesy if you're going to do it in town is to line up the stack of tomes with the confirmation prompt and get a spam click macro, or at least manually spam click so it's over with faster.
---
Last I did it, if you use a fast auto clicker, the game throws all of the sound and particles into one big event, so you explode once at a greatly increased volume and particle effects. Still less disruptive than one at a time for 78 times in a row.
---
&gt; Three? One is the Bench of the Final Judge, The Throne of Ahdashim is a second one... Which one I'm missing?
---
Pile of gold.
---
They just had the infinite tool trio (nothing special, no glyphs) on sale for Thanksgiving. Might still be on sale, idk.
---
Oh she seems to be the person who created the wonderful art work for the cinematics in the Battletech video game?
---
I should have clarified, non partner 3rd party retailers.
---
Oh my god you're right! Thanks!
---
Just the sights, according to the notes.
---
Pretty sure the joke is that strikes were doa
---
No Wintersday next tuesday??
---
Guild capes: Only took 7 years :D
---
Nah his joke is that dungeons are dead while strikes are active development. Thus why strikes are up top.
---
Cloth physics, how do they even work? /s
---
Thief's entire gimmick is to fight unfairly and be a +1. What makes you think thief is ever going to be a good duelist?
---
And we'll *almost* be at feature parity with GW1!
---
Enjoy 10 mins and nothing to do once you’ve put it on. ANet cares more about cosmetics than content. Wintersday in 2 weeks and it hasn’t changed much at all in 4 years.
---
same. mouseover for the menu bar, chat, and minimap would be great.
---
id also like on mouseover if out of combat, show if in combat. sometimes in fractals i want to see the minimap, for markers and things, like in cm99.
---
I thought they wouldn't go for a third legendary weapon set.
---
&gt; Making new content is not maintenance mode.
---
FFXI is still getting new content, lmao and it is absolutely in maintenance mode.
---
10 gold and 10 guild commendations.
---
That's a long time to not have noticed it.
---
Beware, that will be human female meta all over again.
---
Oh, hmm, I guess I just took "less noisy visual effect" to mean both visual and audio.
---
Im not. 
---
I mean, its just ANOTHER cosmetic youll never ever be able to get in the game. 
---
I dont mind monetization, but jesus. It feels like nothing is put obtainable into the game anymore, except RIBA or daily fracs.
---
you cant move anything yet... idk why they keep launching unfinished features
---
That was my thought, too, judging the artist from the work she has done before.
---
In another thread I believe an Anet employee (I would have to go look up her name, I am on mobile at the moment) said that unfortunately they couldn't get the capes to like "resize" with the armor, so they were built with bulkier armor in mind so there wouldn't be clipping with those kinds of things, unfortunately if you have a lighter armor / cloth outfit it'll float up a bit more.
---
It’s effectively a legendary skin. Not sure I like this direction to be honest.
---
Thanks to all the devs involved in the quality of life changes. The UI changes + capes were a great decision and I'm happy they are still worried about such things and listening to us. Wasn't expecting this to be honest.
---
Now I still wanna hope they will slowly add dyeable channels to existing backpacks. I'm sure it will increase the sales for quite a number of them. (I secretly dream about being able to dye my desert rose).
---
check keybinds
---
It already works. I don't remember what the keybind is called, but I use C to descend under water. (it doesn't work when you are on the surface, only underwater)
---
Dyable back items in general will be, yeah.
---
The stacks are always active. As long as you have the weapon equipped but if you want to keep them while transistioning between land and water you need to have one in both your land and weapon weapons.
---
I was hoping to dye Warbringer's flames someday.
---
https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/98c3eMTX_DreamwalkerDagger01.png
---
The community for years have been saying they'd pay for capes and build templates Anet listened and did that that so if you want to blame anyone blame the community who have asked for these things.
---
Looks windy down there mate!
---
Idk why you think that. The game heavily relys on boons and conditions, which is very much the UI. Even if you can see *only* your personal DPS, I'd be happy with that. Of course no matter the implementation, we will see a repeat of how reddit handled anets version of build templates compared to ArcDPS's version.
---
&gt; HoT and raids crapped on everyone
---
lmao
---
&gt;but the playerbase's skill level visibly improved
---
10/10 post. worth reading.
---
Since space-bar makes you ascend, I just use shift+space to descend
---
The "dive mount" button and the "swim down" button can't been assigned to the same hotkey.  That's OPs intension
---
Healbrand is *the* Firebrand build that people should be playing if they're interested in comfortably pugging T4 Fractals + CMs with solid groups.  It's nice to see a guide on it finally.  I think a lot of players got bamboozled by Fractal clear records and setup Diviner Firebrands without knowing how to pre-stack or push the higher DPS necessary to make the more aggressive compositions work.
---
I'm more worried about how you have a cape...  what sorcery is this?
---
Then why are the strike missions for free?
---
Capes! Finally. After how many years?
---
I just tried it again - the message is just that it's *in use*, not that it would replace it. Thanks for giving me a reason to double check :V They're now both C!
---
Thief used to be god-like duelist though, long ago.
---
I hated him, after HoT i missed him, but braham took his space pretty fast.
---
That looks so good on your char dude!!!
---
Idk man I've been there.
---
You put a lot of time and effort into a grind, especially if it's a grind you're not enjoying to get to an end result you want, only to have it ruined/reset/erased by some random misfortune either out of your control or due to some miscommunication, slip of the fingers, etc.? 
---
Looking at having to redo a grind you hated just to get back to a point where you fucked up is pretty lousy, especially for a *game*, that you could be playing for *fun*.
---
It's bad enough when you hit a setback like that at work. That's enough to make you want to flip your desk and walk out, but at least there it's work. It's not supposed to be fun, and they're literally paying you to be there. For a game? Idk. I ask myself if I would be happier spending the equivalent amount of time doing some other leisure activity, and if the answer is yes, I'm done.
---
It hasn't happened to me with GW2, but like, say something happened that I somehow got a Gift of Battle and managed to somehow lose it (I know it's impossible but for a hypothetical). For as much as I hate WvW and as long as it takes me to get one...if I was focused on getting a legendary to the exclusion of all else in the game, losing that GoB might be enough to make me quit. At least for a long time.
---
Spending hours on Not So Secret with nothing to show for it is another good one for me. I needed it for something I'd been working on for a long time and running into a wall on that one single thing was just so frustrating and demoralizing that I realized I'd rather do anything else, and that I was actually dreading having to sit down and try it again every evening. So I quit GW2 for months. Played some Civ and worked on other hobbies and read a few books.
---
Came back and basically just gave up on whatever goal that was and tried to make peace with not being able to achieve it. Eventually at some point I did get past it, but to this day never once have I completed that JP heads up. I've always had to use a friendly Mesmer's portal, or find some way to cheese it. Honestly I just literally hate that JP and it's design and want to never have to touch it again. I don't have any sort of fondness for the frustration or desire to eventually complete it. I feel that I invested enough time there that I should have been able to "git gud" at it and complete it, but random chance and high penalty for minor mistakes meant that I never succeeded...so yeah. 
---
Magnify that sentiment to the game at large and I can totally understand how someone might eventually just look at the whole ball of wax and say, "You know what? Fuck it."
---
all these fit world bosses section more though
---
They are not? You need to buy the expansion to access raids and strike missions.
---
if you want more than solid groups though healbrand is not what you should build
---
I’m happy with the cape honestly I started playing again.. oooof
---
Pretty sure that option only ever removed story from the little Arrow on the very top - the actual "Content Guide".
---
We decided to do a quick rundown of this patch as it actually contained some interesting stuff. I'm personally really excited about hiding weapons and Ele/Engi getting a weapon swap (Even if it is just out of combat). 
---
Hope you all enjoy, and as always feel free to provide feedback!
---
\- Wrin
---
&gt; Idk why you think that. The game heavily relys on boons and conditions, which is very much the UI.
---
Yeah, of course. Glancing at the UI to know when to cleanse conditions or to check boons on your party is fine. What I meant is that Anet said they really didn't want people "playing the UI," which is why healing and supporting is the way it is. As for conditions, they made sure each condition had visual representation and *most* even have PC banter associated with them when they're applied to you "I'm on fire!" etc, which makes it easy to ignore the UI sometimes... or so Anet invisioned at least.
---
&gt;Even if you can see only your personal DPS, I'd be happy with that.
---
I would like that, too. Even if it was just a quick overview when combat ends. I used to use ArcDPS but I got tired of having to update it all the time and I admittedly don't do much instanced PvE nowadays. Just the occasional fractal daily run if I need gold. About it.
---
Read patch notes.
---
i have to say i wish the had killd Majory back at the end of LW1. The clearly dont had any use for her anymore... she went from the bad ass necromancer detektiv ot a wrack...
---
[It works for me](https://imgur.com/a/gKcaa4b)
---
Also... &gt;!Capes!&lt;
---
great answer, thanks!
---
Thank you, I was trying to avoid logging in just for this post
---
1) The trading post 
---
2) Check the wiki for each one. GW2efficiency.com is also a good resource for this stuff.
---
Oh yeah, you're totally right. I remember that video. 
---
I've actually been playing Ventari Herald, and it's a blast. It's basically Renegade but more boons but without the (admittedly very strong) team life siphon. 
---
It's a monster at meta events, for sure with the 10 target boon spam with very strong regeneration.
---
Better organization means they won't be empty as much anymore because casual and lazier people can actually find what they're looking for.
---
realy liked the Prologe Braham. hope he over come his shit ore we need to kill him &lt;.&lt; cant stand his character development anymore.
---
Always carrying around a wep set only for bloodlust seems like a playstyle anet doesnt want to encourage. It also seems imbalanced that you essentially get an extra sigil effect. But idk, maybe engi and ele were never balanced with sigils in mind.
---
Capes are just backpack skins.
---
Backpack skins are selled in gemshop since launch, what`s your problem?
---
All completely cosmetic items with no effect on gameplay that continues to fund the game. Seriously, I don't get the outrage about "GEMSTORE SKINS". They keep the game going so we don't get the pay to win stuff that so many other games do.
---
So.... buttcapes?
---
If ANet gave a fuck about that they wouldn't have made the skyscale's descend the same as the griffon's ascend
---
Another feature players wanted since release being implemented as basically gemstore exclusive. And no, the guild cape doesn´t count. That´s not a cape, that´s a bib...
---
There is already a swim down key, but it doesn't have a key bound to it by default.
---
They can. When you try to bind to commands to the same key, you can get either a yellow or red message.
---
Yellow message means both bindings can share the key.
---
Same for the Skyscale of Life
---
Plus.. I mean. They took years to fix the model of the charr, lol. At begin they had inverse footsteps because the gane thought they had the knees bended backwards. Since they basically applied a non humanoid model on an engine which always had only humans playable.
---
Charrs' clipping was also one of the reasons why they switched from selling gemstore armorsets to outfits. The clipping is just so bad on them that they actually "lost" money with many possible monetization forms being cut off... So it's not so improbable
---
heh I saw it in the patch notes and thought "this is great!" only to log in and realize there is nothing I want to change
---
The new gem store icon fucking lights up when there's new trash to buy.
---
This game is now just a glorified cash store that serves a little bit of content on the side every two months to make ~~players~~ buyers come back for more.
---
Season 1 memory boxes!!! Finally!!
---
Am I the only newbie here not seeing the problem here? Someone care to explain please?
---
It's the way it should be. 
---
In most open world games, "pull up" for planes is often the same key as "go down" for helicopters or swim down.
---
I have bound my heal key to C
---
While I'm monted I can't activate the mount's heal ability.
---
Double key asigning works definetly NOT for me even if the options say so
---
Oh hey, you're still at Anet. Was actually wondering a couple weeks ago while digging through known Anet artists' works for [wiki categorizing](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Category:Concept_art_by_artist) (it always needs to be fuller!).
---
Noooooo don't tempt them. Underwear skins on the gem store. Lingerie anyone? /s
---
Wow, capes.
---
The post is stating that this bug is fixed, so yes, there's no problem anymore.
---
"No." - ArenaNet.
---
i'm guessing that Screen-Edge Effects isn't in the game yet?
---
It's just because of the update all you have to do is redownload it and update it because that worked for me
---
Capes are one of the most difficult things we've ever had to implement, for so many complicated reasons. Backpacks are similarly irritating. One of the many factors here is body scaling and armor. There is a single backpack model which has to work whether you're fat, skinny, wearing a skin tight suit, or huge, bulky, spiky armor. If the cape is fitted snug to a skinny, tight suit wearing character, it will be completely inside the body of a chonker in giant armor. There's more to it than that, but hopefully that starts to give you a better idea.  
---
I am one of the creators of backpacks (not capes) and I care deeply about the game and the people who play it. I take great pride in my art and I want it to be the best it can be for everyone. Unfortunately, game development is a series of compromises and this is the best possible solution. It's almost never as simple as it seems.

Hold the fuck on.
---
Guild Wars 2 has capes like in guild wars 1 now?
---
I need to know if I am able to come back
---
There's a rewards team?? Could've fooled me.
---
Yes please.
---
Why u think they added this *cough capes, gem store, cough* :)
---
Uh look at the picture, they look shit and EAnet are clearly just looking at another cash grab doing minimum work on them.
---
If I can't annoy the crap out of people at the bank by leveling up 78 times then I'm pretty sure nobody would complain if they got rid of that entirely. The benefit it gives is largely outweighed by people constantly knocking crap away when doing things like farming the Halloween Labyrinth.
---
I read that as wooden cape at first.
---
I would buy a wooden cape...
---
:o
---
Does it vanish during transforns like shroud/holo/etc?
---
I thought about that but then I remembered all the times where I wanted to make sure I was on the correct weapon before engaging.
---
Hmm I clearly touched a nerve.
---
Where has the appointmenyt of a programmer had that reaction?
---
So you start with 1 fallacy and move to another.
---
That is pretty normal when a new patch comes out. It doesn't happen every time but it is also not unusual if it does. I didn't have that issue for this patch though, is your copy of arc older than Nov 19?
---
new game build's out so you might have to get the latest arc build.
---
How are you upvoted
---
"The first cape, the Basic Guild Cape, is available from Guild Commendation Traders." - From the patch notes :)
---
I just want the scarf. I feel like I'm never going to own it.
---
the want rampage to just be a CC tool in PvP and making it do 0 damage means you can CC chain in stealth so there you go
---
Yes and no. The full map in the gw.dat file goes beyond what we can see in-game still. When PoF launched, it only went to The Desolation and Kourna. With Daybreak, it extended further south to Istan. The map in the gw.dat goes further east than what we see in-game though.
---
Working as intended unfortunately. It looks like they were designed with your character wearing the thickest armour in the game in mind. If you aren't wearing super chonk armour, it will look weird and you'll have a gap.
---
Well, they could make it like the accessory dye, and require a makeover kit. But that would be too boring.
---
First, we would need customizable swimwear. Actual customizable swimwear. Like the swimwear we've already seen NPCs wear.  
---
Of course, they can't make swimwear into outfits since going around fighting in underwear only make sense for drunken norn, so it would have to be a separate thing.  
---
And to make it worth developing, it would have to be worth getting for more players, and for that we would need more places that put players in "swimwear" mode.
---
Right now, the list goes as follows:
---
* A beach in Pearl Islet in Southsun Cove.
---
* Diving goggles. 
---
* The changing tent in Labyrinthine cliffs.
---
And that's all the places and content that will put players in 'swimwear mode'. What else could put players in swimwear mode?
---
* The changing tent  could be also a guild decoration purchased from the Treasure Hunt Reward vendor, to make the minigame more rewarding and useful once you've unlocked all the novelties.
---
* More springs, rivers and beaches far from enemy spawns across the world could put players in swimwear mode.
---
* More activities could put players in swimwear mode, like Crab Toss and Southsun Survival. 
---
* More adventures and jumping puzzles could put players in swimwear mode.
---
I still don't understand what it is.. this just links to a list
---
Aaaah didn't think about that. Fair enough!
---
Also, a side note: Return Peak Performance Death From Above ability, for the fun factor. I love jumping from high places, screaming: Yippie-Ki-Ay! It not longer works without the ability.
---
What do the memory boxes do?
---
There's no gear grind or anything in this game though so ALL the things to earn are cosmetics and novelties.  If you put it all in the gemstore there's literally zero reason to play the game, just swipe your card.
---
Damn. Don’t have any guild Commendations
---
The norn wouldn't have needed to go south, if Jormag stopped quite a bit north of where the norn lived.
---
Bjora Marches was near the northern reaches of norn territory - only Jaga Moraine extended further north, and there were few norn settlements there and no indication of more even further north.
---
Jormag had personally crushed Gunnar's Hold under a glacier when forcing the norn south, and that was south of Bjora Marches (but north of Eye of the North), and Jormag only stopped chasing the norn with Owl's sacrifice. Season 3 heavily hints that where Jormag decided to stop is inbetween the Eye of the North and Bitterfrost Frontier - and Jormag's presence is a heavy reason for why The Bitter Cold area is sub-zero temperatures.
---
It does do something - it removes story from the list of things the content guide (that is *only* the swiveling arrow at the top) points to. That's how it's functioned at least since right after HoT.
---
Thanks for the capes, they are finally there! It gives back some Guild Wars 1 vibes where everyone was wearing capes to see them in the game again. 
---
Let's hope there are a lot of capes coming!
---
Yeah. I feel especially bad for those working on gemstore banners. A lot of recent stuff is accompanied by a fully painted artwork.
---
I like how the Defualt builds working, but slight note i wouldnt mind. When keybind swapping between gear, it would be nice of when you see that "activating template" on hotswap, it actually showed the Template name, and hung around a few seconds later
---
Having people read up on [Brook's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law) before posting would also be a good start in getting rid of a lot of the "just do {x}" variants frequently seen around here.
---
How does a warrior go stealth without a thief? I'd be ok with it being a tool for CC if dash did Knockdown.
---
Guess the patch notes are just imaginary for some people.
---

**Brooks's law**
---
Brooks's law is an observation about software project management according to which "adding manpower to a late software project makes it later". It was coined by Fred Brooks in his 1975 book The Mythical Man-Month. According to Brooks, there is an incremental person who, when added to a project, makes it take more, not less time. This is similar to the general law of diminishing returns in economics.

Pathetic. They put in capes and its behind a paywall, how fucking filthy low can ANET get?

Fully support these changes, that "Open World" category was getting bloated. Some people are debating the specifics, but it's better than it's been.

Dye backpieces?!?!?!?!

This is what y'all asked for.

I really like the art style!

I still run it sometimes. I love the class and the cc is amazing.

The reduced the coefficient to 0.01 for the CC skills.
---
Way more CC skills across the board should be like that. The stronger and more spammable the CC, the less damage it should do.
---
I see more of a problem other skills not working like that and this skill getting this treatment without other getting it too that the change itself.
---
This feels like a bug
---
You look away for one minute and the next thing you know they are implementing features of GW1 into GW2. Crazy stuff.
---
F
---
&gt; Ahh my bad, needless to say this is incredibly disappointing.
---
How else do you want to keep up company employing 250+ people, and their only meaningful game that is B2P MMO with no optional subscription, being only in the west (world?) providing 99,9% uptime of servers and regular content uptades (even if it's not the content "veteran" and "Experienced" part of the community might have wanted)?
---
Honestly, what do you propose? Patreon campaign? Donation based system? Finding sugar daddy?
---
You can try it now. It didnt work as of at least 2 weeks ago.
---
Never thought I'd see the day!
---
It would be. It's useful for a variety of different applications, not just being able to check that pugs meet your gear requirements. If it lets you see skins too, including the outfit ("The appearance of this item is being overridden by [outfit name]" when you hover over an armor piece), it would be a very valuable feature.
---
But, I would like a toggle to be implemented alongside it that notifies you in chat with their name when someone starts inspecting you. You could toggle the notification off if you wanted. This would maintain a bit of personal interaction between players.
---
It would also be cool if you could leave an "inspection comment" that gets posted in chat after you close the inspection window, detailing (or just generalizing) why you inspected them.
---
Of course, people whom you've blocked would not be able to inspect you at any time regardless of your inspection settings, and thus would also not be able to leave inspection messages.
---
I want to literally hide everything except events, who wants the event info to disappear?
---
Gotta do some guild content!
---
It's a Basic Caöflroöekfkdöeöbfjeuebnqlaödåebfngniwlsnsns
---
I came here for this
---
This is my biggest problem. It's become muscle memory to blow my heal and potency mantras at the same time.
---
Where have you seen warriors stealth and throw boulder's while staying invisible?
---
Stiff backwards bib. 😂😂😂😂
---
It's on a 120 cd, for 3 possible stuns with no damage? Why would I ever choose that over Signet of Rage?
---
works like this on other professions aswell. Seems intended and is nice to have tbh
---
Antique weapons.
---
That would be possible had they completely removed the damage instead of just putting it as a miniscule amount. It hasn't happened but it could.
---
Examples of this can be seen with old Winds of Disenchantment and old Condi Trapper thief.
---
Thank you for the reply. With such communication community should be way forgiving. Kepp up the good work :)
---
Getting cc chained from stealth was too strong. It kind of needed a nerf.
---
Cries in ad infinitum
---
They should make two more better looking "free" ones to go along with Shimmering and Tenebrous weapons. I may or may not be asking for that just because I'm sitting on a bunch of crystals.
---
Drakkar It’s an area from GW1 that was more or less west of Bjora Marches and had a huge frozen lake with a champion of Jormag frozen underneath
---
The bulk of the damage has always been in Dash. The reason people always bring Rampage is the CC spam that keeps people from reacting too much between uses of Dash.  
---
Even without using the CC, the autoattacks + Dash still did more damage than Dash + CC, but people preferred to use the CC, because that keeps enemies from reacting much. If enemies can't react and use healing skills, it's easier to burst them to death.  
---
To reduce that burst potential of rampage, now they force players to choose between CC and damage. Can't have the cake and eat it too.  
---
The change has been a tad overturned, but remember no change is final.
---
...not for show/hide on the trinkets or maybe hold off until we get more legendary ones
---
Its definitly better, but this is probably as far as they should go, they definitly should have more tiers on menus.
---
You know I'm right.
---
How about non predatory loot boxes and basic features from the first game not locked behind a paywall.
---
Path of Exile highlights how pathetic GW2's monetization is.
---
OP said 
---
&gt; Years of us asking for capes like that, years of nothing and, when you finally do it, of course it's in the Gem Store 
---
Not only the cape in the gemstore is missing the actual purpose players have been asking capes for (guilds) but there is *also* a regular cape with this feature accessible outside the store, which makes OP’s complaints inaccurate.
---
Legendary guild cape inc
---
You're not okay with the free basic non gem store version being basic if they make one? Alright.
---
I just want dyeble legendary backs.
---
I like how the effects of this dagger at its base level is more legendary than an [actual legendary dagger](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Claw_of_the_Khan-Ur).
---
The more I think about it, the more I realize it's the perfect aquatic mount!
---
I wonder how many people saw this and instantly thought of making theirs to match their skin tone.
---
maybe they do care about cosmetics but they don't like the fact that most of the cool ones get stuck behind the gem store, which is apparently what anet considers the real endgame.
---
It's not one extreme or another which is what they and their bootlickers seem to think it has to be.
---
how does 1 new artist disprove that? also, hyperbole.
---
Yep. Because its not "oh lets add a little sparkle if they want cash", its "well we'll throw in a basic one, but make it worse, so players feel incentivised to pay".
---
Its an old tactic of any freemium game. Make a shit version that is upgradeable by $$
---
NOOOOOOOOoooo well rip my 6 month old icon, 2019-2019.
---
If GW2 ever changes to PoE or Warframe's monetization methods, this subreddit will have a meltdown. 
---
People are complaining about gem store with its cosmetics and QoL features and you think Path of Exile would work here? They are selling $ 80 skins, even pets. $ 50 for a single pet, every cosmetic is in shop and you look like a hobo if you do not buy stuff except leagues. Even if you do not care about cosmetics, you gonna need storage upgrades. Actually, PoE item shop is the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen to be called "fair".
---
Warframe literally sells in-game weapons, some of which are (like the Hate scythe or War gs ) really rng luck drops in the game. You can, as a low rank person, can buy weapons that can only be used at certain higher ranks, like Arca Plasmor, ( it is easy to level up your rank imo) and in addition they have prime packages that locks some of the cosmetics directly behind a huge paywall. There is also skins on pc, steam workshop, that can only be bought by paying. They are also selling item, experience, item amount etc. boosters that double your rewards, which makes a huge difference in a grindy game like Warframe. I still think they have a really monetization method as it is %99 PvE stuff and everything is overpowered anyway but if you want any deluxe skin or almost any skin, you will be paying for it with premium currency (which is like gems in GW2 and can be traded in-game)
---
GW2 has its problems especially like putting build templates in gem store or RNG mount selection that cost a lot but compared to those games, has the fairest gem store model and I would really like to see people's reaction if all of a sudden GW2 decided to go full dollar-only gem store with $ 40 items.
---
Blocking someone doesn't stop them from seeing your lfg posts, it just blocks you from seeing theirs iirc.
---
Oh... aren't these items already available from laurel merchants and others?
---
I'm already thinking about all the new possibilities.
---
Also, rejoice Charr mains for the clipping shall no longer be a huge pain in your furry asses!
---
Skills are already monetized ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Wait, they finally implemented capes?
---
&gt;Arcane Resurrection: This trait no longer increases revival speed. Auras granted by this trait are now granted only to the elementalist, and they're now granted at the start of a revival attempt rather than at the end. This effect has a 20-second cooldown.
---
Nooooooooooo. I really enjoyed how speedy it was to res people :(
---
More of a question related to PvP, do you see alot of warriors doing that in PvP? I haven't seen it in ranked or unranked or tourneys. Damage reveals, constant blasts is not enough for a chain-stealth from rampage.
---
My wife loves it - she congrats the person every time she seems it go off.
---
I missed that...nice.
---
It's our button for many things, those really bunkery and tough guards that just won't go down, it's for the other side of damage, defense.
---
Sorry you're getting downvoted, but it's a good point! I played the GW2 alpha and did beta testing in early release and decidedly did not purchase the game for myself until several years later. It's much better now than it was many years ago. I still prefer GW1 in some ways but GW2 has become a fun alternative now.
---
 [https://www.pathofexile.com/shop/category/daily-deals](https://www.pathofexile.com/shop/category/daily-deals)  Minimum "deal item" is a $ 4 decoration. Others are $ 31 armor and a $ 25 armor.  [https://www.pathofexile.com/shop/category/armour-effects](https://www.pathofexile.com/shop/category/armour-effects) their armor sets are mostly priced $ 42 and $ 84, how is this using extremes when this is the generic pricing?
---
For Warframe, every deluxe skin gets literally added to only store. Prime packages and vaults are games regular money makers, they are not extremes but their monetization method. Devs, themselves, in dev streams say it. All the new frames get added to item store, weapons too, even the ones that are behind syndicate ranks like Baruuk.
---
Both PoE and GW2 have lootboxes which are, in addition to RNG mount licenses, are pretty bullshit mechanics that should not exist in any game imo but saying more than % 50 of GW2 gem store is more expensive to get than PoE is simply funny and I would like to see you list them.
---
Sorry just to clarify - I would suggest also that the items with specific colors not have the channels such as the flowers. But I think it's really the coding issue that they decided held things back. It would be a large job to fix this then go back through inputting the channels as well for all the items
---
The damage isn't enough, on chance that you hit, Dash does 3k crit, while the 1 does 2k crits. In the 10 sec duration of rampage, it'll resolve in about 8k crits total, on 120 cd. It's rough.
---
They said the same about capes.
---
Nooo dont shatter my dream with the flowers :(
---
This^
---
&gt; due to these practices
---
How exactly do you expect them to generate sustained income then?
---
They have no subscription.
---
They give away the episodes for free.
---
They sell no power, but only convenience and cosmetics, in the shop.
---
They give you free versions of most items, and usually have some in the challenging content as rewards (raids, or whatever).
---
Genuinely curious how you expect them to generate revenue, over the long term.
---
It’s been like that for years.
---
henge.  if you dont do it know, you will want to die later.
---
Because^
---
you could've done this before by swapping it from your inventory while out of combat, right? or did you lose the buff when you unequipped the weapon with the relevant sigil??
---
Stop cheating.
---
&gt; How about straight selling cosmetics instead of predatory loot boxes and stop selling basic features from the first game.
---
But the new cape is a straight cosmetic.
---
You are changing the topic, and bringing in your anger over other areas of the game into this issue.
---
To be clear, no. What you want is customization.  Dynamic responds to conditions other than sheer user input.
---
Wish I could upvote this more, it's incredible the ways people will justify avoiding learning and improving at the game.
---
&gt; wasn't meant to be a "casual" game 
---
Development = design. When there was no clear end-game/goals first three years, then it was clearly made to be casual. Furthermore, dungeons were never updated with new rewards other than TA-aether which was a big failure. Legendary weapons were not even advertised until HoT and legendary crafting came about.
---
Getting many thousands of gems in gw2 has never cost me a cent of real world money.  Gold isn't hard to make, and they let me get everything with it.  Come back to me when that is an option in PoE.  Warframe literally sells non-cosmetics as their standard fare.  Actual weapons and frames.  The ability to upgrade those weapons and frames.  If GW2 did that, I finally would quit playing.  You really are using basically the worst two examples of a cash shop to be like "They should do it like this."
---
Cheer up :V
---
This is just pure eyeshore. Holy shit they are unable to even make adjustments to the UI let alone even try to overhaul it.
---
I mean why is it even bad. Firtly, it's open world... secondly why can i faceroll my keyboard on full glass reaper, and kill everything but on my glass weaver im really weak. And in open world, reapers burst is better also. Imo a small buff like this is nice. Might run the toughness stacking sigil.
---
I normally have the d3d9.dll inside the bin64 folder. Sometimes it needs to be inside, sometimes outside, sometimes either works.
---
stripper wars 2
---
Male Norn Strippers.
---
So what?
---
How about you pay for content they create, and don't expect free stuff.
---
If it's getting new content then it's not in maintenance mode. It might not be developing at its peak pace, but. . . ok, I guess some of ya'll need the actual definition here, "maintenance  mode" is the point in a game's lifespan in which there is NO further development on the game, and all staff is limited to *maintaining* the status quo. This means keeping the servers running, customer support, infrastructure patches to address changes to the software environment, etc., to just allow the game to continue running as-is. 
---
It does **not** mean "the game continues to be developed, at roughly the same pace it always has been, but in a direction that I do not like."
---
It doesn’t sound like you’re interested in fractals much, so stacking high AR will mostly be useless for you. The 2-3% is nothing to laugh at, especially to flex on your friends your dps, and is basically the last thing you need in terms of completing gear, so I think it’s a worthy investment. I would just get full +5 power/+5 ar infusions or WvW infusions if that’s your thing and use that pretty much everywhere. Swap in your 150 ar when you want to dip into fractals since you have legendary gear and youre good. Would also highly recommend swapping to power dps chrono for fractals as support chrono is kinda eh in fractals.
