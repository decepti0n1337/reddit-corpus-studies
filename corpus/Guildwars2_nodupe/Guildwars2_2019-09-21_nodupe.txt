Looking to make a quick gold, huh? The Order has been gathering some information about different methods so you can pick one you like. [Here is the list](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/search?q=how+to+make+gold&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=month)

RTX ON  
---
RTX OFF
---
Surprised no one has said it yet, but actually, it looks more like RTX ON vs not even ambient occlusion being enabled.
---
Isnt that illegal or something?
---
&gt;If I'm at a wall and want to go up, and the path is clear, I'd race you on a springer any day.  I've been near a wall doing something, someone calls out a bounty or something in map and I don't need to travel so far, just jump up to the ledge it's on. That is faster on a springer.  
---
And my point is that there is no way "bounty spawned exactly one Springer jump above me" is a reasonably common gameplay scenario. Generally you're running to the bounty at least a little bit, so you have time to start your ascent away from the cliff and use the skysca boost to gain altitude, or the springer loses time doing a second jump while you can just boost off the wall, or there's a short hop over a gap or ledge that a skyscale can do much faster, or there's a horizontal section through mobs that a skyscale does faster than a springer and you can't swap mounts because you're in combat.
---
The fact that the skyscale handles so many different real situations gracefully is what makes it amazing, and the fact that the Springer needs perfect conditions to barely pull ahead is what makes it too niche to bother with, for me.
---
&gt; Not to mention, if there are branches around, like many places in Dragonfall, there's zero changes of my springer sticking to them.
---
And damn near 100% chance of hittinf your head on them and falling all the way down, or missing the tiny branch and plummeting. Dragonfall was so hard without the skyscale, it's so much better with it. There were even posts here about how obviously anet made dragonfall to highlight the benefits of the skyscale because no one would use it otherwise.
---
&gt; I agree in most climbs, I'd rather use my skyscale. But there are climbs I believe to be factually faster. Like using a beetle to get to the wall I want to go up vertically, would be faster to go beetle/springer than just skyscale or beetle skyscale. 
---
Just hope off your beetle a half second earlier amd point your skyscale at the top and boost. I really can't see how a Springer charge can be faster than that.
---
&gt; I still use my skyscale more. There are just some areas/jumps that Springer is better for me.
---
Well if you can point out one so I can try it out myself I'd appreciate it.
---
What are those shoulders from?
---
you dont say x)
---
The modes you mentioned put you into group/party, not squad. It's entirely different system, even it seems like almost exact same thing from player standpoint. And you need squad for strikes. You would also need a way to determine squad leader.
---
Yeah. The animations are stiff for sure compared to 2, but there's a lot of really good looking places in GW1.
---
Just buy one off the tp
---
Most likely the case, yeah.
---
What? He wasn't complaining of anything.
---
You mean all those AFK necromancers?
---
seems just to be a macro. turn, tab, 1
---
Alt parking at the emd of jps,gathering spots, etc. Is quite good.
---
I have heard this before and still have no idea how to turn my 4 gift of explorations into 2000 gold
---
&gt; Only 14 pairs of these shoes...
---
That's convenient.
---
I'm pretty sure that's the exact number of people in the overlap of the "People who play GW2 vs People who want to wear/win Air Jordans" Venn diagram.
---
Ele. is better at healing than Mesmer. Ele always has healing no matter weapon, traits or builds via Water Attainment, just as Mesmer always has a CC with Shatter3.
---
Mesmer's weak because it is balance it with damage mitigation. Reflects, Distorts, Blocks, and Aegis have to be timed and used tactically to avoid hits. While with and Ele you can just stand in lava and be healed through it. (Scourge and Scrapper are similar when you they just say F-it and spam Barrier.)
---
If you're on a US server, hit me up in game on Vayne.8563. I teach the game to a lot of people.  Particularly helps if you have discord.
---
Do your daily achievements for quick 2gold, do the world boss tequatl the sunless in sparkfly fen every day for another 2gold. if your geared for fractals of the mists, do the daily achievements in the highest tier you can and open your encryption boxes for more gold. All can be done within an hour or 2. 
---
I find it a pretty good way of you don't have much time to play an it builds up.
---
You know what? Just because it's on the wiki doesn't mean your effort is not appreaciated.
---
We need trade offs. Just running  the min max, i'm  close to 29k hp WITHOUT FOOD/OILS.  Barrier atm needs to be a lot more work on the healing power as a whole to the point I wish healing and regen had separate functions with how the pulse for regen especially
---
100% agree with you; had to go with this gold because Posterity was too green-ish. Did my best to match the weaponset but the shoulders definitely too bulky. That being said, DEFINITELY my favorite shoulders in the game, makes me feel like I'm playing guild wars 1 again :D
---
*cries in Australia
---
Hey! So its the magnus left eye patch, the luminous heavy chest plate and luminous heavy leggings (the birthday armor) with the heritage gloves and leggings and the Ebon Pauldons!
---
You can get the APNG file \[here, and one without the logo. \]([https://drive.google.com/open?id=1aL2yFQd\_H8aOK63Bhh0LulTATiVrN-xB](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1aL2yFQd_H8aOK63Bhh0LulTATiVrN-xB))
---
Gw2 bloom is also very overdone. I always have post processing off barring a handful of circumstances.
---
Felt most appropriate. I'd check out the site, there are some really cool looks on there (I'm really partial to the Auric Revenant, check it out)
---
That looks awesome! Once you get the shoulders I think it'll be absolutely perfect! :)
---
No idea why the bloom in this game is so overdone.
---
Agree so much. I just like it when the game's coherent visually. While we're at it, cutscenes have had so many different styles over the years :'D My favorites are the HoT ones, with a lot of animated and painterly elements. Felt really unique.
---
tempest is built around overloads and one single trait also bypasses that.
---
I don't get the clear bias.
---
Meowth had me dead.
---
can you distinguish between a build, any build, and a subpar player?
---
it's a rhetorical question.
---
How are Reapers for fractals? I've taken my condi Scourge to T3 while my healing scourge isn't far behind. I want to get a set for Reaper eventually, as I love the GS on them.
---
I'm just more confused why the mechanics of the class have to be butchered in pvp and pve for this highly questionable change in wvw. Like, this actually doesn't help anywhere. 
---
I just came back to the game after a long break and really got into my necromamcer enough to continue it as my main. This is really disappointing for me because I was really excited to play support scourge in fractals and raids. This kills the feel of the class, putting down a shade is now highly questionable. It makes more sense not to put any down at all and to move around yourself so you don't get denied utility. 
---
I dunno, just my opinion but I'm disappointed.
---
Wait... I just assumed the top one was GW2 and the bottom was GW:EN.
---
I was like “omg the graphics have come on so much....”
---
It was only when I looked closer that I realised the person in the top one was a ninja and we don’t have those in GW2.
---
Do your daily crafts like mithrillium or charged quartz.
---
An alt parked at wyvern matri in vb is always a food choice.
---
Don’t reply me reply the op :(
---
I don't know, but it's human nature to shit on the only good thing that's at hand, so it wouldn't surprise me.
---
Development of the game could be debated. Unless you are referring to gemstore content.
---
What a great list! I made a 'casual' [Halo Spartan](https://imgur.com/a/tJSP2k0), but I think I could use some polish on which pieces to use.
---
&gt;do WvW/PvP dailies for about 2 weeks 
---
Just Ktrain in WvW with boosters and have it done in 4 hours.
---
actually i typed all that out with my fingers, you fool
---
yeah, Patron under General -&gt; Tradesman, title + 5ap
---
I very VERY rarely use it anymore, mostly for very tall vertical cliffs that would take the skyscale a little longer to clear and to hit break bars. My springer is basically in semi retirement lol.
---
I would be genuinely astonished if they were not aware by this point
---
Barrier removal.. That's interesting. What if poison reduced barrier application by 33%?
---
How does fallen teleport at 1.13?
---
He had no sak and no distortion but teleported to avoid that shockwave you normally fly up to avoid?
---
Fractals highly prefer power DPS over condi, especially at T4. [Reaper](https://discretize.eu/builds/necromancer/power-reaper) is a good power DPS option and has great cleave on top of being fairly tanky. If you're in a high tier group they should be running renegade + firebrand to cover quickness and alacrity and both of them are better healing options than taking a heal scourge in fractals. So yes, gear your reaper for high end fractals as the other two options are not great.
---
feels bad to play thanos i need crystal infusion
---
Most young charr models don't, they ran into a problem this map where they had like 3 total "young charr" models and they needed more ways to differentiate them, so they just downscaled a bunch of adult charr models so they could design them to look/dress differently and players could tell them apart.
---
Along with the Braham VA being super noticeable it was the only 2 things I found to be immersion breaking in an otherwise solid release.
---
I did the same thinking there might be an achievement for doing so. I changed to condi build to make this go fast, disappointed that it just sits at 1%.
---
Right. Thanks for the tips!
---
Farm IRL is the best way
---
Start flying up from farther away and aim the dash upwards, this feels better than slowly ascending upwards but of course it is not always possible.
---
I remember getting that dialogue! I didn't know if I succeeded in reassuring him until it told me I missed one. 
---
I should probably rethink the way I speak to children
---
Thanks!! I think this is just what I’m looking for :)
---
GOD hearing Braham’s voice with a slight filter on it coming out of every NPC’s mouth was so immersion breaking. But oh well you can’t blame Anet too hard, VAs are expensive.
---

How do the torches at Effigy event in the new map work? I pick them up and they're gone. I dont understand it

I ended up writing a massive counterpoint argument to his video in the youtube comments. I think he has good ideas, but I think he is a bit exclusive with what he considers to make a good open world. I disagree with the things he excludes from what makes for a good open world design, rather than what he excludes. I think this is exemplified by the fact that he thinks skyrim makes a bad open world, whereas guild wars 2 makes a great open world. I think this is sort of blinded to the flaws of what makes guild wars 2 a less immersive world based on ignorance of the game. Conversely, it shows that he dismisses the relevance of roleplay freedom, quest design, and immersive elements that make skyrim an excellent open world
---
I was wondering about that myself. Thanks!
---
ANet policy is very simple.
---
They ban players that lose them money.
---
They don't ban players who make them money.
---
I played guild wars 1 when I was in elementary school.
---
I wish I remembered it better.
---
Mine has been reset **again**. Same for you?
---
The leggings are from a pretty damn popular  company so i'm at least respecting that. Hot topic is actually neat to me since it's at least a physical chain to get stuff now considering f2p now. I'll likely get the joko pop it looks decent and I'll oust myself as a fan since funko as a brand makes it super easy to buy merch to support stuff I like.  The problem is some of merch etc are decent. But then for every nice  Rin design on 4fans, we have  bullshit stunts that are clearly "WE ARE VIRAL READY &lt;3". This is early early internet at best marketing for stuff. It's damn clear we have A and B teams in quality of trailer etc. But marketing is clearly pulling D at it's best. The posters was the last time I actually felt a rise in decent attempts because at least posters still get noticed for games on the regular. Let's look last 2 years step in were I forget. Kung "HACKERS ARE MESSING UP OUR WEBSITE GUYS", FU (literal) tea, our data had wording in the ToS they could  freely sell. The car...yo actually the car was hype but were the hell did that budget come from, (the mouse pads etc was cool since but idk why anet removed daily rotation for tracks for bonus medals making a track sucks now). A watch that, I've only worn a watch once in like 4 years now at my sisters wedding. "SNEAKERS". Bruh. I'm a retail grunt, if I get shoes I'm wearing them. The only way this gets viral is because 6 pairs ever made and statistically no fan of the game is going to get these  because if by some snowball chance this takes off every sneakerhead I know runs major amounts of bots to try and snag rare pieces as they go up.
---
Right. You just don't have to actually do the 2 hour meta tour
---
I thought raid selling only took in game gold. I thought RTS is illegal in all cases.
---
I think this is pretty common in video games though. Streamers have used "luck" as a subscription model for a long time in giveaways. Giveaways are a bread and butter for streamers on big events, etc. It promotes health of the game and it's typically pretty fun in a stream. Now that said, I don't know what this is referencing, and I'm sure there are toxic ways to loophole this collaborative relationship with Anet and Streamers, but I do think there is a difference in a more broad perspective.
---
inb4 they make the meta have a 5 minute timer before you fail.

They do ban Raid Buyers who pay with Real money, I've had at least 10 buyers tell me they got banned afterwards. Stop spreading your shit.

Does healing scrapper is a part of the meta for all game modes?

---
That's a massive essay...and a lot of effort you're putting in.
---
You can stop now. The more you try the more you expose yourself.
---
Piggybacking this to also point out that you don't need to participate to get the daily rewards.    
---
I jumped into  a public, told the two other people there that while the lobby was still filling up I was going to get my kid a snack and a drink, thinking i had time before we started and everything. Came back to 3 bouncy chests and a timer to leave the instance
---
HoT gives you gliding and PoF gives you mounts(you only need the Raptor and the Springer). Both shave a lot of time off of map completion. My first clear, which was on an Ele, took a really long time because I had to find a way to keep up Swiftness AND stay alive. 
---
One Ele specific tip is to get a set of Nomad armor with Ambrite accessories &amp; staff, and Runes of Speed(these are expensive so swap these for runes that boost vitality if you're poor). With this second armor set you'll be able to just run through mobs and other obstacles to get POIs and you can better survive falls and environmental condos &amp; rebuffs. Do not get rid of your other gear because you will need it to do the hearts and any normal PvE activities. I use Marauder's armor(you must craft it yourself as it is account bound) because of the extra vitality but Berserker's is the go to damage powerhouse.
---
Now we need updates on who's winning HA. 💖
---
Depends on how many friends you have on your friends list. I have a couple of hundred. It might be unmanageable.
---
Mirage's False Oasis grants a mirage mirror for more Ambush skill usage. Literally the exact same use as Berserker, you blow your heal skill for more dps.
---
There's some sort of bug that cancels the torch too quickly sometimes, and I'm not sure what causes it.  If you have a blue icon on your buff bar that flashes and starts to run out, that's a sign of the bug, wait for it to go away and pick up another torch at that point.
---
Well, I didn't know who he is until I saw him. Never played Overwatch only watched a few videos.
---
They'll be wearing some of that *sick* GW2 Bangarang merch too, one of those ~~fuckugly~~ dresses and tights, and they're of course wearing their GW2 SteelSeries headset and listening to the soundtrack through Tidal.  
---
(Did I miss anything? I think I missed a few things.)
---
This is why I turn down my contrast when playing GW2.
---
are there other accepted formats which can hold animated stuff aswell for steam?
---
Sure, I just want just check some opinions, personally I did this while wait for a guildie to create a squad so it would be kinda usefull, maybe with some tweaks to it
---
Buy gems -&gt; convert to gold -&gt; buy mystic coins -&gt; buy raids.
---
Bag slot is only for one character.
---
Kaineng with mounts and bigger could be awesome though.
---
Assnet will always be trash.
---
Oh look, someone trying to bring some (most likely factual) dissenting clarity that the echo chamber doesn't want to hear and gets spam downvoted.. And people wonder why reddit users are a minority of the GW2 population: people don't come here for discussion, they come here to bitch and moan.
---
which forum? if you don't mind me asking
---
Solution: Make Scourge more of a support class, less of a dps class. Move some of the dps condi application to CORE necro.
---
Cantha
---
Haha wtf i took the top 2 ones
---
It looks great
---
Ayy that's from my post
---
Grothmar
---
do you know how confused i was, seeing a Dervish in a GW2 screenshot, thinking it was the GW1, then realizing the GW1 screenshot looks better but thinking it was the GW2 one until i saw the flowers?
---
Boy you sent me on a journey
---
yeah, i couldn't be less immersed in open world gw2 while in skyrim i could go for hours
---
Which is RMT
---
What exactly is going on. Do we have evidence to catch this guy? Did arenanet have a response to it? Fill us in for those who are out of the loop.
---
A follow friend or track friend feature. Turn it on or off.
---
Considering that it does say "a choice of Living World Icebrood Saga materials." it might suggest that the reward track was not supposed to go live yet, and therefore is not working as intended. Seems weird to release something with a choice that doesn't actually exist yet after all.
---
Oh damn, I thought i just didn't get the reward chest because I was very close to finishing the track when I logged off and was over half way through it when I logged on. Turns out it did indeed reset at some point, I just finished a full track and did get the reward chest.
---
brb remaking thread
---
LS3E6 was pretty close
---
It's okay when Charr do it. : ^ )
---
They were warmongering and genocidal, I feel like a lot of people took GW2's softening of them a little too far.
---
How are they wrong though? Scourge thrives on stationary encounters, what difference does it make if the shade is how it is on live or their proposal? Heal scourge would work pretty much the same way it does now, same with condi.
---
I wish, that armor was badass looking in GW1.
---
I turned up my graphics settings and went back to the map lol. I'm in love with the environments in this game.
---
It's been a long time since I played so I don't remember if the pieces I picked were even final, but some time ago I did [Knight Artorias](https://i.gyazo.com/4293a36fb188bc9792609d70b1cd2131.jpg) from Souls
---
Some looks might be alright, but in the end nice screenshots seem to matter more than a good look. Also some people are quite unfriendly.
---
&gt; It could be that the GW1 designs were simplifications/modifications of the "original" designs, and now 250 years later we've rediscovered the GW2 designs, but then why does Malchor have the *GW1* style Dwaynas in his workshop?
---
AFAIK this is the official explanation, when Orr rose old designs were rediscovered, but I don't really buy it. Orr sunk only a few years before GW1, not enough for style to change so drastically
---
You have a tough road ahead of you, my friend.
---
You guys are talking about this like it is something new. Gw2 streamers were doing it for years.
---
Wait is that not just for new maps? Did they actually do it game wide?? :O
---
GW2 looks great until their cash shop/infusion monstrosities come into frame. The games aesthetic is damn well butchered from a player characters perspective.
---
Oh as far as I know its only new content. Doing so on the old maps would be just too good to be true
---
It's triggered by specific keywords. Hard to tell the combination chosen by moderator but it may be something like "how"+"gold"+"farm"
---
in fractals your best bet is damage
---
Clearly an avenger's level threat...
---
Skyrim is basically only appealing as a sandbox, it depends on you RPing your own world and narrative within the game's framework. Not to forget the frequent use of  copious amounts of mods too.
---
GW2 on the other hand is a curated experience, the world has it's own story to tell, rather than primarily being a world in which to create and tell your own stories.
---
For that reason the video is very much on point, and why games like Skyrim are horrifically overrated. Great for RPers, awful for exploration. You're essentially buying a toolset in many ways, rather than a game.
---
I'm a dedicated engi main going back 7 years now, and regularly do raids and cm fractals on the class. For open world and lower level fractals there's quite a few builds each having their own strenghts. Pure dmg you'll want to go holo, but scrapper offers a lot of utility, support and quality of life that makes it a joy to play. For endgame content there are 3 (4) main build you'll want to look at. 
---
  
---
1. Power Holosmith: Really competitive damage numbers with a satisfying looping rotation.
---
2. Condition Holosmith or Condition Core Engineer: A good condi build in most situations. Holo has a better burst, but core engi will do better sustained dmg in phases longer than 2 min. Rotation is famously one of the hardest in the game, but all the more satisfying for it.
---
3. Heal Scrapper: Good amounts of healing, defensive buffs, utility, condi cleansing and unique damage mitigation in the form of the Bulwark Gyro, but sadly held back by it's lack of offensive boons such as might, quickness and alacrity making other supports more common. It's a fantastic way to carry an inexperienced group and also makes a great secondary healer in a raid squad since the boon problem is sorted by other classes. 1 druid is enough for 10 man might which leaves a spot open for builds like heal scrapper to really shine. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If you have any questions feel free to ask!
---
Damn, terribly sorry, i even had it written down, terribly sry m8
---
WoW thank you for your info. was just wondering about this too XD  
---
right now are people super anti Eng? I know the gw2 meta can be super bad at times
---
Idk what's about the big serious dudes who got a very busy professional life and no time to smell "virtual flowers" but still waste that valuable super limited time whining on a board the devs seem to ignore, but I always find them hilarious.
---
So you don't like games with spread out content, timegates, daily rewards with no repeatability that dictate the pace at which you should play the game, or at least you're too mad to work your way around that. Well, I've got super bad news for you, you're playing GW2 and that's pretty much how they do things. And I mean, that's how they do everything. Most open world mobs are just slowbots who inflict cripple, chill or slow on you and die in 2 hits, most non-expac story has you do all the hearts in the new map, every "nice" reward is locked at 1 per day or week, every single meaningful pvp/wvw currency is earned through time with no correlation to skill level or efficiency, the best way to get gold and currencies is by brainlessly farming/gathering for hours and isn't accelerable by being better at it. Crafting anything better that exotic has at least one timegate, most collections have some too. Hell there's even a currency you can only get through logging in everyday.
---
Hate it as much as you want (I personally hate it with utmost passion) but that's just how they have made their game, and how they keep making it. 
---
&gt;spending over an hour not progressing the story and having our time disrespected 
---
Ok, you're mad you had to wait 20 minutes between events. There's a valid complaint with "tyrian time" not being clearly explained, but the panel litterally told you where and when the next big event was going to take place.
---
&gt;In your analogy that's like going to a bar and having to wait 20 minutes to be told what you are going to have. If you take out the busy work and padding it was an hour of content which now that I've finished wasn't bad actually. It was decent story content.
---
Nah, in my analogy that's going to a bar and being told "there will be a wine tasting in 20 minutes, but you can have beer or anything else in the meantime" and you throwing a huge fuss about that.
---
i needed like 20 secs to figure out which one is which, so it doesn't put GW2 in good look
---
I was never taught how to tip because my family rarely had the luxury but okay.
---
Click bait titles are...
---
&gt;!annoying, but hey welcome!!&lt;
---
just wondering if you reported them to Anet?
---
What's that chestplate? I've never seen it before.
---
There's a difference between providing a service and expecting to be compensated and providing a service because you enjoy providing the service while it doesn't cost you anything but time and makes you happy.
---
Take the people from [PINK] for example. They are at every daily JP, helping people with portals because they love helping people. And never once have I seen them ask for a tip/donation. They just love what they do and I'm sure they still gets tips despite not expecting them.
---
If you provide a service and you expect compensation, then you aren't asking for tips, you are asking for payment. Get over yourself.
---
I would love this feature
---
Yes. Like for example BogOtter. He was doing it long time ago. He was doing big giveaways, and almost all good skins, like legendary weapons, were always sub only.
---
Its not like I am blaming or defending someone, just saying that I can't see anything new here. Maybe in this new case (the case ppl are discussing and meme about) there is something more.
---
I can't answer for those two specific ones but implying that OP (or me, or anyone else who helped out) rushed these cosplays is pretty rude. He too worked several days to perfect many of these and redid a lot of them over and over again. I spend weeks on mine. 
---
You are not the only one who tries.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but do you mean that, because people like me think raids should be a challenge and something you learn, instead of just facerolling it, many players will not even try it because its... Idk, too much effort?
---
I can't blame people for not playing it. The last time I tried it I loathed almost every moment I actively tried to play, but pushed on to "give it a fair chance". Never again. Anet simply doesn't care about the quality of gameplay and it shows. Everything from class balance to matchup balance is broken.
---
You’re right. Still, there’s something about gw1 art style that makes the game look still fresh.
---
Not sure if you are trolling on purpose or just refuse to see the point I'm making in every post. I'll write it out one more time, just for you.
---
**Providing a service expecting compensation is not asking for tips, it's asking for payment.**
---
Somebody who put hundreds of gold into his home instance because he wanted to complete it for himself is not going to be asking for tips/donations. They enjoyed putting the gold in for themselves and enjoy it when other people get something out of it. Somebody who filled their home instance expecting to be compensated for it by having other people visit and loot it, isn't asking for tips. He' asking for payment.

The musician who put out his album for free and expects donations is asking for payment, not for tips. There are plenty of musicians who put out their albums for free because they loved making it and want other people to hear it. They don't put a donation button under it because that's not what they did it for.
---
I wouldn't mind home owners asking 50s upfront. They build up their home expecting compensation, they put a price tag on visiting and looting it. It's their right to do that. But they, also, aren't asking for tips.
---
Why ido gw2exchange mods have issue with cello ? Seems like butthurt thing to me.
---
Well I don't judge whales myself because they support the game, and everyone is entitled to spend their hard earned money the way they please. I myself have been considering converting gems to gold for a legendary.
---
I think it would be nice if you cosplayed one of GW2 characters, lol
---
It can be a coding name that has been left and forget, and then was put in the translation, but usually those are in between {{name_here}} so no idea
---
How can I identify such creatures?
---
He lowkey trynna flex with his gold haha :P
---
Exactly.
---
I am tailoring myself towards this build as well. I was searching for Rise! then i realized it's Reaper spec, so I use a signet instead.  
---
Also minions die quite easily. I found flesh golem kinda squishy, but maybe it's b/c i am low lvl.
---
&gt; druids
---
&gt; a tip is inherently voluntary by the giver
---
Uh, news for you, so is a donation. And anything that isn't given voluntarily is extortion. So are you saying that saying "tips welcome" (which makes them optional!) amounts to extortion?
---
"Tips welcome" is not even _remotely_ the same as asking for, or expecting, a tip. It makes it optional. The price tag is free, you're doing it as a public service, but you won't stand in the way of people wanting to tip you. 
---
Which part is difficult for you to understand?
---
I get a lot if these in WvW.
---
patreon is where you pay a subscription to someone for whatever they are offering.
---
Giving in-game items only to people who are paying you real money is literally what Real World Trading is.
---
The raid stuff people are talking about. Using the black lion company to trade real money to in-game money is allowed. And then using that in-game money to pay someone else for an in-game service is allowed... so theres no problems there.
---
Now if you were to directly pay real money to someone for a raid, that would count... but also would be really hard to detect since no items are changing hands. It would have to be detected by people using in-game chat methods of talking about it.
---
Bit of advice, it is alot cheaper/easier to make something else (like berserker) and star change it
---
Vipers requires alot more mats :)
---
Everything fine with that bud. I dont accuse you of flexing :-)
---
Welp, with me always deleting characters for no apparent reason I will never get it LMAO
---
I think it isnt about the giveaways, giving away stuff to the people that support you is completely fine. People saying hes giving away so much stuff that its impossible for him to make that much gold by himself, so hes probably using the money from his supporters to buy items and/or gold through some RMT site which is against anets policy.
---
There are healing builds but the need for them is extremely niche except in various extreme endgame scenarios.  In most cases outside of T4 Fractals or Raiding in GW2 you're doing yourself a disservice by playing a pure support build because it destroys your independence and your ability to explore or play the game as a solo player.  
---
You don't want to give up your ability to deal damage unless you know *exactly* what you're doing because it makes exploring and completing events in the HoT/PoF open world both a heartache and a headache.  This is why most support builds in GW2 tend to lean towards being hybrid builds like Support DPS Firebrand or Support DPS Renegade.  
---
No one is saying that you can't run a support build in GW2.  What we're saying is that you shouldn't run a *pure* support build.  The usage contexts for pure support builds in GW2 are tailored more towards specific situations.  Rather you should focus on builds like Quickbrand, Alacrigade, Might Tempest or Boon Beast.  [You should specialize to provide a specific boon or set of buffs that doesn't eliminate your offensive capability or provides significant,ten-man oriented boons/buffs.

Nope i dont want to be stalked by people
---
Putting it out there. I won a give away recently. I'll post if he he delivers. I am literally one of those guys who followed because of the freebies and gold making tips.
---
That being said, the gold making tips work but they're nothing new if you've played any MMO before.
---
i'm curious how they got detected as a RWT raid buyer. Because i'd assume that unless the players are careless and meantion it somewhere in-game as thats how its being paid for, there wouldn't be enough evidence.
---
I wish I can get a souvenir 😓
---
Hello friend, Cello is real world trading, please stop replying and saying I'm not saying that. I am saying he is RWTing, because he is.
---
He is selling items, for real life money, he is a gold seller, and his patreon subscribers are the gold buyers.
---
I'm saying people who buy ILLEGAL GOLD and give it to raid sellers, GET BANNED, source: Raid Seller whos literally gotten banned from recieving illegal gold someones paid with.
---
Also its not hard to find RWT gold.
---
No, but I had the same thought and did turn them on high to check for the symbols. Still blank :/

It'd be nice if I had friends

I don't really want to repeat myself.  All I'm going to say is that wells are significantly more effective than minions, and that playing with minions conditions players into bad positioning &amp; habits.

---
For the Well build you would have to sometimes w8 on cooldowns, but maybe you prefere wells over minions.
---
For crafting disciplines it doesn't really matter what you take, take Tailor, Artificer, Weaponsmith, Jeweler, Chef   all are good.
---
Try to always pick up banner buffs. U can find lots of banners in LA (Lion's Arch), use food which gives you more exp on kills, maybe even join a guild and pick up a Guild exp boost (you can also pick up a crafting boost from guilds to make your crafting faster) and also mobs, nodes, and Vistas that havent been killed, farmed, used in a while grant you bonus XP. for example there is a random mob which just respawned, you get idk lets say 300xp. But if the mob lives for a couple of hours or so, you will gain 300xp + 1.000 bonus xp. Also dungeons are a good way to earn xp. Dungeons havent been updated in a while, so they might feel a bit clunky but are still fun \^\^.
---
Hope i could help a bit.

May the Schwartz be with you

So the situation is that people sub to him and he's giving away stuff to his supporters? And due to the amount of stuff hes giving away to them, people speculate that its some kind of greyzone and in reality they are no supporters, but RMT buyers that "just won a giveaway" by spending XX amount of $ to support him?
---
What the fudge?
---
GS mirage with stamina sigil and SB daredevil are pretty good.
---
I typically have it set to autodetect, (which ends up being pretty middle of the road settings on my poor laptop lol) but I did turn my graphics to max to check for the symbols, with no luck.

By that logic Gold Sellers should never get banned because they don't say that they sell gold openly.

that could be exactly the case, maybe they are upset that he appears to make a lot more money than they do and they are jealous. i tend to take what subreddit mods say with a grain of salt, so short of any actual evidence ( i member brigading claims in this sub ) i would be cautious in believing what they say. having said all that, something weird is going on but theres no point in giving a shit about it as clearly anet don't give a fuck and we all know what happens when they don't give a fuck.

Yep, depends on the volume of tickets really, but they're likely very backed up since there's probably a lot of returning players needing help into their accounts due to the update.

I'd personally say I find it easier to RP in the setting of Tyria then the setting of Elder scrolls, but I know less about the latter and have never been able to be drawn in, even with hours in skyrim (never got far into the story), brief playtime of morrowind, and 275ish hours spent in ESO. Hell, fallout 4, and fallout 76's world drew me into it more then Skyrim did I'll admit. Could be world, could be the fallout lore is a bit more solid and less "wtf?" then elder scrolls.
---
Open world is great, but if you just plop me down in a beautiful, open world with no main storyline  or the world having it's own story (as you say, Rilgebat) it'll end up being a "Oh, this is amazing visually. Okay I'm done." Conan exiles (the earlier versions) was exactly the same. Amazing world, but (at that time) boring.
---
I feel like it could be said of exploration (for some people) is the difference between exploring, and exploring because we want to learn more, see more, and hear the story of the world. Skyrim is great but I never felt a need to just wander around and see the world. GW2 I explore because I want to see the world, see how it's changed from GW1, and learn the stories and lore of each area. 
---
I suppose this is all entirely subjective, and will never bash or hate somebody for liking Skyrim over guild wars, but NEITHER are the end all of "exploration".
---
Done it once, got the shoulders... not bad gold/hour.
---
Fun little note: He couldnt pay for teh CES at teh time so he bought it on credit, took over a week for teh seller to get paid for it.  
---
All he wanted was for WP to advertise him.
---
the fact that you made 4 tickets in 4 days probably means you gonna wait 2weeks+ now since you put yourself down the queue
---
Oh I know about the RNG factor, and the drop table probably doesn't change, but the Strike Mission reward is daily and have valuable items tied to it, while Raids are harder and the best rewards are weekly. Even if the gold value of these items drop a bit, and they will I'm sure, this is only one Strike Mission, how will they handle it in future releases? If they restructure Raid rewards, we could maybe see an influx of new players coming from the Strike Missions, then ArenaNet will have more reasons to continue Raid development.
---
Mirage + 3 clones, all shooting 2 beams every few seconds, all of which pierce . If you're fairly mobile, you can literally create a grid across a load of mobs and hit everything in about 5 different directions over a 1200 damage. 
---
You also have at least two decent AoE attacks for more tagging, but they're only really needed if you have no clones up. 
---
It's brainless and easy. You don't need to really aim at anything, just keep your clones up and spam mirage mirrors and evades. The hardest part is avoiding the silent cooldown on ambush attacks.
---
And its not like we can say we arent used to it anyway. I remember Skyrim, every other npc had one of three different voices :)
---
The weird thing is that others have asked support if its ok for themselves to do it and were told they could not but this person supposedly has messages saying what hes doing is ok. Is this just another case of anet being consistently inconsistent?
---
There is also the other issue where some of his patreon tiers were absolutely rmt and couldnt be argued with since it was money for guaranteed item.
---
I decided that I'd use my charr warrior when doing a second playthrough of the prologue since my first playthrough was botched by a weird audio problem. He used to be a Berzerker Banner Slave for raids back in the day, so I decided to tweak his build a bit and made him a pure Power Zerker... It's already pretty involved trying to maintain Berserk Mode for as long as possible, but adding Peak Preformance has just been annoying.
---
Half the time I end up just forgetting to use it, and the other times it gets I the way of my maintaining Berserk Mode. I'm sure it'll get better once I've practiced it more, but dang if it hasn't been the least fun aspect of running the build.
---
&gt; champ farms that require people to ignore or stall a main objective AREN'T intentional.
---
100% correct.
---
Perhaps a little "Would you like to join?" with a green tick/red x.
---
Those giveaways can be a smokescreen for him to be RMT himself. He get paid by someone with gold, and he gives him a legendary that he "won" in a giveaway thus gaining likes, subs, comments and views and whatnot while getting the money that someone paid him for the item. He didnt shown his process of choosing a giveaway winner afaik.

In Europe waitresses(those who provide directly service) is payed by the employer/owner of the establishment. Only in USA there is a policy for waitresses to get paid only by tips. Sure people with big pockets in good mood tip, but most of the people don't. I worked for years as a waitress/barman and I wasn't tipped all that often and I cool with that, I mean I already make my cut, extra money shouldn't be taken for granted.
---
the comment is still there
---
Luckily, you're wrong. You're correct about the champs spawning just like the champs at Amala, but you completely missed the fact that they're spawning at 75%, 50%, and 25% rather than on a timer.
---
We've been down this road before, and Arenanet has learned this lesson. Any activity that rewards people for stalling or failing an event isn't intentional and will be patched out.
---
those "TP Barons" arent rich by giving away 16k usd in gold every so often..

This issue has been discussed for a lot longer than a week.

You can just come back next reset and try again, say you were trying to get a Ghostly Infusion though, killed Gorseval once and didn't get it? Well good luck next week then... Want Dhuum's bench or scythe? Well of course! Have the same chance for both Normal and Challenge mode, didn't get it either way? Good luck next week again. You see, it doesn't even matter if you're doing normal or challenge mode, they won't even reward you twice (one for NM and one for CM), why is that? I see it purely as bad design.

If they nerf healing values, or in the case of Shelter, decrease its block duration then it's fine since the skills would be gaining additional effects to essentially compensate for the loss.

Couple things w regards to strikes specifically:
---
1) Your group got extremely lucky.
---
2) This is the first of many strike missions to come. And this one in particular is going to rank up increasing in mechanics and evolving the model as well in episode 1. 
---
3) As long as rewards stay rare-ish, you will attract more people to do them. And you will also attract people to do them who want to do them fast. This means players'll need to optimize a little bit when doing strikes. ie: considering a composition that contains group might production which is essentially the biggest factor
---
4) The strike *will* become less profitable as more people get the shoulders etc. In the same manner that Ghostly Infusions prices have steadily been dropping.
---
5) that\_shaman datamined a challenge mote for the Icebrood Construct. In the similar vein of how fractal 99 and 100 are practically jokes in non CM mode but pretty punishing in CM, I would expect to see that sort of progression here.
---
With regards to raids:
---
1) Repeatable CMs are in internal talks
---
2) I would love more raid rewards but that's not what drives a raider. Keeping this distinction is important because even if you can create strikes that get people into raids, if they are in it exclusively for rewards, then raids probably aren't for them anyways. Raids **are** lucrative but it takes time to get to that level where they are (ie: doing a wing clear in half an hour average). People always talk about gold per hour but gold per hour validity is based on scale. If you consider the % of time a raid or a full clear would take for instance vs how much total time you spend in game for instance.

Does this also mean Soulbeasts don't need to interrupt their Whirling Defense if the red ball is about to go off? I'm not terribly sure anymore how the two interact all of a sudden, because if reflection works then it shouldn't need to be interrupted to use the special action key... But I swear I've had contradictory experiences where it still spawned the red field.

&gt; Are healers in the multiplayer content necessary  
---
raids: yes  
---
fractals: no in good groups, (mostly) yes in pugs / not so good groups  
---
dungeons: no  
---
openworld / story content: no  
---
___
---
are support roles "needed" in group content:  
---
-&gt; no if you play with scrubs which do not care what they play.  
---
-&gt; yes if you play with people which care at least a bit  
---
what is a support role? usually in gw2 the healing is just ONE aspect of a support role. a supporter usually does less dps then someone in a dps spot in the group, but brings in much needed utilitie and the boons to enhance the damage of the full dps specs so they only need to focus on their job while you have to do different things like blocking stuff for them or doing certain mechanics in fights.  
---
that doesn't mean you can or should slack in fights. you can see a big difference in a supporter which is good and a bad one, alone on his damage. take chrono for example on a boss like sabetha. you can have a scrub chrono which puts out 2k dps and can't upkeep alacrity and quickness, while you can also see good chronos which upkeep those buffs on their party, but do 12k dps.  
---
...a support roles is not necessary someone which heals a lot. take full diviners renegate for example. your job is to pulse alacrity, give out some might, help breaking cc-bars and give out a lot of other boons / other utilitie if needed like projectile hate &amp; condi cleanse or sometimes even boonrip depending on the encounter.  
---
granted, even with no heal stats at all, you will heal your group more then enough with the kalla elite + heal.  
---
so all in all, you do not think in gw2 in terms of: i am a healer.  
---
you are either a dps or a support or a mix out of both...but the latter is a bit rarer. if you play a support, you usually bring something to enhance / protect the dps dudes and you have to do certain mechanics which drop your dps less then if someone else would do them.  
---
you totally will not see that playstyle: yay i am a healer and therefore can be brainafk while tapping heal from time to time in gw2....but you also will not see that playstyle on dps dudes or any other class if you do team content....in raids not even the tanks can just stand arround doing only the tanking job and be brainafk.  
---
in the end its an active combat system and you usually want to build your group arround the encounter at least a bit and you want to build your group arround certain boons / mechanics you have to do in the fight. stuff you will always see in a good group: build arround max. might, fury, alacrity and quickness. additional other individual party buffs like banners, spirits etc.
---
Smiley charr are best charr.
---
I’ve actually never tried that build myself bc condi gear is hell to get so I don’t have it on my ele, but it does look like a really fun build for meta events! I’m not sure how it would hold up in general open world content (I play fa power tempest in open world personally but do whatever you enjoy!) and I don’t think it would be an ideal build for t4 fractals from what I know about it but if you have condi gear it seems like a fun meta event/open world build to try out
---
No i just found that i am talking with someone that has limited brain activity and so it is pointless as it is like talking to a 4 year old just barely able to ask for food.
---
"2 hour of metas with 50 mins wait" only if you are brain damaged and actually wait for metas while doing nothing else.
---
Thanks for showing me what a prime casual player thinks like. I needed a reminder i am far far away from the likes of you LOL.
---
I don't, really. The environments are super nice but lot of the architecture or character designs don't have much imagination or immersion going for them.
---
We would need a way to create categories for friends, and a way to give those categories settings like "Warn me when they make a squad", "Warn me when they create a LFG for raids/dungeons/strikes", "Show they location in the world", "Show me when they earn an achievement".
---
Lost my guild bank, what’s the deal?

I played F2P equivallent for around 5 years before finaly buying both expensions. I regret not buying it sooner but I did not run out of things to do for 5 years so... silver linings.
---
&gt; the gw2 graphics are amazing
---
Yeah and no. The new stuff looks awesome indeed (Pof/HoT) but this is stuff that is almost 8 years old and it shows.
---
guess i missed that change.....
---
that makes the class even more boring tho now it's just faceroll
---
for fractals might signet o.0  
---
as you said it helps in longer fights but fractals are short burst phases (mostly)  
---
guess i need to hit the golem for a while and figure out how long the fight is allowed to take till might is better -.-
---
Just slowly walk away without looking away until you are far enough, then run away as fast as a you can.
---
weird flex but ok
---
To be fair if it's like, high quality action figures like what are sold on Hot Toys that *actually* would be pretty cool.
---
They won't do that, of course.
---
The reason the rewards are so high in gold cost is because its *new* go look at the dhuum chair, it was selling for 10k gold (max on TP) when it first dropped (now at 500, a 95% decrease) the ghostly infusions were 1k each now at 100 (90% decrease) this new strike mission is *only going to be valuable for a few months tops* all the drops will quickly be under the 50g mark in a month or 2, if the chance of getting it is higher it's going to drop even more. If it's the rarity of a chak egg sac yeah, price will be high but I doubt it.
---
Yeah he is pretty „famous“, a lot of people know him. I saw him today for the first time
---
There is no point in giving Revenants a nice and fancy UI for every legendary either, but it adds a lot to flavour and makes it look a lot more unique and pretty.

---
There's a teleport shrine? That jp took me longer than the boss, when I died I spawned at the beginning of the jp rather than where the other players were waiting for me, so I assumed there was no checkpoint
---
They don't drop from everything. Drakes, bulls, wolves, and wargs are my go-tos. There's a farm outside Claypool where you can run around killing groups of irate bulls. There's also a sweet spot west of the springer ranch where you get clumps of wolves, dolyaks, and rock deer that all (except maybe the deer? I haven't paid attention) can drop the meat. Try there.
---
I agree. It's especially weird considering this is supposed to be a bridge towards raids. The squad is an essential part of a raid. As it is now it feels like an open world event with an artificially limited number of players.
---
That's not the point, but okay...
---
That's not how it works...
---
I'm pretty sure it's the same voice actor too.
---
I get one from about every 4 animals I kill of species that may also drop red meat or poultry, at any location, at any level, like wolves, dolyaks or moas.
---
What have you been killing?
---
&gt; "”recovered" "charr" "artifact"”

i've never seen it drop from birds

https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Slab_of_Red_Meat
---
I tried. I farmed Moas, Wolves, Bears.. basically anything that drops red meat. It would drop the rare cut aswell or so the wiki says. But i got nothing ://
---
Its just another way to do it. I never play PvP or WvW so I will get these things doing PvE but people who solely play PvP and WvW can get these items without leaving the game mode.
---
I like achievements because I use them as a content guide. But if you only care about achievements for the skins then fair enough

Yes we know. You won't shut the fuck up about it.

It wasn't, the mods must have re-approved it.

Grammar!!!

Sorry Charr suck.  I remember Ascalon.

and you're positive you have all the new cooking stuff done? do you remember doing the quest where you escort the cows and have to watch them get butchered with this guy?

I've heard lots of opinions and they all seem equally valid.
---
- Cellofrag's videos on how to make gold on the TP hurts their bottom line, so they're lashing out.
---
- They're Paul Blart Mall Cops who see someone breaking a rule and they want to make sure that person is punished for it.
---
- They're actually completely correct and have gotten confirmation directly from ArenaNet that Cello has RMT'd his way to his position.
---
- They tried to unsuccessfully do what Cello is doing and are upset that Cello is getting away with it.
---
- They're just butthurt and want to feel important. I mean, they are reddit mods.
---
In the clown world of 2019 it is also a white power symbol so i m surprised it hasnt been changed yet.
---
Thats something I hope to come out of the new format of their devlopment team.
---
I've never been warned / suspended for asking for money to pay for instance nodes. And I do it every time. Can't increase my home instance nodes if you don't pay to use them. So that you get more the next time.
---
You can't get event credit by killing enemies in the vicinity that aren't part of the event, no.  You can, however, wait for event enemies to respawn.
---
Alternately, you can heal/give boons to NPCs involved in the event, and that will give you a small amount of credit.
---
ahh reddit, a place full of sunshine
---
Sounds more like a fix than a nerf to me.
---
try farming the wolves and deer/doe all around butcher's block. just run circles and slaughter 50 or so, they respawn so fast you can literally just run laps killing them. that's how i farm it. sometimes it takes 20+ enemies to drop any then i will sometimes get 3 in a row. if you farm that for 5-10 minutes and get 0 drops then something is wrong
---
Well he was warned to take it down when it was a legendary. He didnt take the black lion skin one down and added the ghostly infusion one later. His response was that he wasnt explicitly told to take those down so therefore it was ok. It was still an exchange of money for a guaranteed item. He hasnt learned his lesson and is still defending offering said exchanges.
---
They shot themselves in the knee with that. When Siren's Landing launched you could buy more coffers the more events you participated in. This was really lucrative so people were afk until the events, tagged all 4, and went afk again. 
---
Then they changed it to a fixed 8 coffers, made the loot a bit worse but removed the event participation requirement. And now you have fully afk people stacked behind every monument. It's ridiculous how Anet does absolutely nothing about any kind of AFK farm and instead keep creating more opportunities for this cancerous behaviour.
---
You took it from us first.
---
Thanks for putting this together. There are some really cool and also disturbing looks.
---
Only played prophecies... I'm not that far yet.  Right now I know we are cool in gw2 but charr are still assholes in my book lol
---
Others have. Cello posted some screenshots of a ticket supposedly from dornsinger stating what he was doing was ok because it spread positivity. Other people have submitted tickets asking if they could do similar offerings and were told that it was rmt and it wasnt allowed.
---
Recovered "Charrtifact"
---
Awesome! She reminds me of Jiji in kilos delivery service :)
---
It's rude asura, he probably has tens of thousands in assets on the TP and in his bank.
---
Yeah, will sort out an authenticator. I'm a bit surprised I haven't received an e-mail regarding the ban since it doesn't look like anyone has changed the e-mail associated to my GW2 account. 
---
Just logged in after not playing 2 - 3 months to find out I'm banned
---
I can't unsee this. Bwuk!
---
Thank you :)
---
I see him move all characters at the same time pretty often. Other people in this thread agree and have video evidence.
---
Those two don't exclude each other
---
Ill try, thanks :)
---
*an
---
And since said RMT needs to go through Anets own RMT systems, they get a cut
---
100% percent positive. I got the title and i KNOW i got the rare cuts before :)
---
Sure, GW2 is better in general. 
---
In this specific one? Nah
---
First thing I thought when I saw it 😂
---
Are you talking about Local.dat in AppData?  
---
I only remember deleting it occasionally would make loading a bit faster or something.
---
Haha. Gottem
---
thanks
---
and how is this related to GW2?
---
Also, spoiler
---
&gt;!If he openly hates humans wouldn't there be more questions about him being involved with renegades?!&lt;
---
I don't think you realize how powerful Shield 4 is, and the double AoE stun on 5
---
Well... I think Slow Lorises are the epitome of cute, so whatever that interpretation is.
---
Just send one ticket and wait, it's all you can do really. Response times might be longer right now because we just started a new season of Living World.
---
Boo hiss 😝
---
it's not, he is farming karma
---
Maybe Orr's designs were considered extremely old-fashioned at the time, but when it rose they were now ancient lost retro designs and therefore fashionable?
---
It's his GW2 character singing it in the art, is it not?
---
ok. so since their is no rotation in WvW. I didn't stun my target to close in on and get a second stun on my target. so instead I'm walking up like a moron getting free damage by my target, because rotations do not matter. I'll use a blast finisher before I use a fire field right after i close in on a target which will not give support to my allies. and since rotations do not matter, any added pleb that would have gotten stuck in my fields would just walk away and got no cleave. 
---
since I don't use cleansing gyro, I don't have a chemical field. therefore i don't have a 'free' skill. since I've made an active choice to specialize in blasting targets and allies instead of support. since we all know that their are better classes that can cleanse more efficiently.   
---
lets keep wasting time. because someone doesn't understand the fact that their are more ways then one setup to being in a battlefield. because at the end of the day. it doesn't matter when you have 50+ PEOPLE DOG-PILING ON A FUCKING ZONE!
---
considering that you cant even use a search function to find out that this question was already asked and answered 3 times in the last 24h hours or so, chances are high that you fuck up some so badly while submitting your ticket that it will take ages for support to sort it out
---
only on w10 though
---
I removed bloom with D912pxy and am still amazed by how much I'm not missing it.
---
Oh damn, that's a shame.
---
I think they played that fine. We went from the other Charr not wanting to jump to conclusions to "Oh yeah it's totally him" in a few minutes of story.
---
They didn't *want* to think he'd actually go that far, but it didn't take a lot of convincing either.
---
Ok cool thank you. And exotics should be fine for beginning? I don't need ascended gear?
---
how is scourge in 2-5 size (do you mean group or fight size) a niche? power can be killed fast, but condi is still very strong.
---
On the plusside; they were so bad that I hoarded so many of the trans-stones I'm now sitting on a pile of about 1400 transcharges.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Rune_of_the_Monk#Acquisition
---
Same problem for me. Tried every graphic setting from high to low, the tabletop stays blank.
---
And they are openly flauting the gold they got from leeching by the infusions etc.
---
Exotics are fine if you only want to raid. Raids drop alot of ascended stuff so it helps gearing up
---
Bahahahahaha you don't even know what you're arguing anymore.  The only conclusion I made was that you have no data to be able to say "most people".  I acknowledged several times early on that I don't have the data to be certain.  I've been consistent in my conclusion that you've been consistently wrong.  Again, your argument is not supported because you have no data.
---
Nice ok cool. I was kinda stressing on how to get all ascended cause I haven't even seen any yet.
---
I'm a horrendous re-roller lol! None of my characters are over a year old except my Guardian who I made the instant the servers came up during the headstart. I just keep thinking a different class/race combo will look better, play it to 80, leave it, then do the same on another character. Thank god ascended gear is account bound. I had a Mesmer I made around a similar time, but I deleted her about three years ago for some stupid reason :(
---
The large majority of my flist is great commanders. I give them nicknames based on the event! ie: wvw, kralk, boss train, map name etc. So another vote of yes please from me!
---
Gw2crafts.net
---
What bosses do you play scourge on for the torment? You play it for epidemic or barrier/transfusion. Arguing that torment is a major factor is flawed because renegade and mirage are miles better.
---
The single disappointment for me this episode was that it ended with Bangar alive.
---
I still have an instant trait reset :D
---
As a huge fan of the more natural GW2 looks, I love this. Those shoulders and the heritage gloves fit really well, and I love how you tied the colour scheme to the rarely seen Ebon Vanguard weapons.
---
healing venom and shadows refuge?
---
[Mordrem Menders](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mordrem_Mender) can be interrupted by damaging them while they are healing.
---
Pvp and wvw reward track also works. Think that's the only alternative.
---
Interesting, ty for sharing.  
---
Also, where are you in map? GW2
---
1. It's not a good way to lvl from 75-80 whatsoever, go do some renown hearts of quests. 
---
2. Each crafting has its own station in major towns (like lions arch, or your race hometown) once you talk to the master next to the station you can learn that profession and begin crafting gear! 
---
I HIGHLY reccomend you google some crafting guides as the cost of getting it leveled will vary massively depending on how efficient you are. 
---
Hope this helps a bit!
---
LS3E6 storyline was Commander's fever dream
---
Your quotes are driving me mad.
---
thats actually terrifying
---
So so so so so so so so dissapointed ... when i saw the emote as a reward, and considering the GW1 vibes of the map, i thought "cool necro dance emote f yeah!" 
---
SadPanda
---
They are both Augury Rock.
---
Seems like with Jormag officially being a dragon that influences the mind, Bangar is most likely under his influence and leading the charr to get Icebooreded.
---

I don't think it's fair to dismiss it just because it's WoW. I actually have to agree - healing in WoW feels better to me, whereas I find GW2 a little frustrating, especially druid. I think it's because GW2 was originally designed to stay away from the dedicated trinity, so the 'new' healing specs can feel a little clunky still, although definitely more dynamic than WoW. 
---
I do wish Druid had a disco-priest Penance style heal instead of staff 1, though. I loved that spell.

---
go run with a zerg in world vs world.  pick a reward track.  you will have plenty of tomes of knowledge before you know it
---
Ii started to really accumulate a lot when they introduced them as pvp season rewards. That was an amazing change as I was always short on them. have 900 right now and I would never complain about getting more as I still remember the old times.
---
Berserker over core on non CC heavy fights. because it is higher overall DPS because of berserker traits.
---
But it has less of a mini burst as your F1 is now different. Therefor power signet on all 10 F1 is better then peak performance on like 2-3 and axe 5.
---
Power DPS warrior takes both though.
---
Yeah, I do miss the healer mechanics from WoW, it does sometimes feel like I'm just dropping whatever healing AoE my class has in GW2 and buffing everything else. 
---
That being said, healing tempest is great fun. I can't help but come back to it, the class is so flashy.
---
THANK YOU.

Try these.

yeah exactly..
---
You can take the Death Magic tree which buffs minions and gives you toughness for each one summoned. That, and Spite and Soul Reaping are the specs I'd go for as you level, then eventually swap for Reaper.
---
His son would be creepy =p
---
Still have 2 of these! 
---
And an instant trait reset! Haha
---
Never getting rid of those
---
i'm ignoring nothing, you are ignoring facts that don't support your conclusion, which is your right, but it still means you're wrong. you have shown how you *think* i am wrong by using bias and faulty logic, you claim that because i do not have statistics which only anet have access to, i cannot claim by using any other data available that most people will not have that many obsidian shards. i've told you many times how this is possible and you refuse to acknowledge it because you are too stubborn. my argument is supported by **all** the data that we have available, yet that is not enough for you. if it looks like a duck, acts like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's probably a duck.
---
Indie game amiright?
---
I see nothing wrong here. But I am also a player who thinks asura look great in the first place.
---
I couldn't disagree more heartedly. For once since PoF I am actually interested in these characters and their development. Crecia and the rest of the cast included.
---
It's a known bug. Changing maps usually resolves it. 
---
For whatever reason, it's just a quirk of the game.
---
point taken. you're still farming karma
---
Do you really want newly introduced villain (I guess he is) to die in same episode? After (real) Lazarus who appeared and was killed in same episode (even better, in last instance), I don't want to happen ever again.
---
Upvoted :)
---
I don't think he should be a villain. The story and world will be a lot better if someone like Bangar remains in a position of power within his own race. GW2 suffers seriously from focusing hard on the Commander and his/her perspective. Against Zhaitan we were told all races needed to rally together to do what had never been done - defeat an Elder Dragon. Destiny's Edge was the proof of concept (a group of the five major races working together with each of their strengths managed to do more than any individuals or groups from the races alone). With Dragon's Watch we moved away from "it takes everyone" to "it takes the Commander, Taimi and Aurene".
---
Bangar is a racial leader of one of the races we left behind in the story. The Pact has largely been replaced by Dragon's Watch and the original theme of "no one group or race can do it" went down the toilet with Kralkaorrik. World leaders should be concerned about Dragon's Watch and Aurene.
---
Bangar's behaviour isn't that different from Anise's in S3. She literally puts a kill switch in the player's heads (it's still there) that she can activate to kill the Commander any time they break their oath not to threaten the Kingdom of Kryta in any way. That effectively means, if the Commander is put into a position where they are forced to choose between Kryta and the rest of Tyria, we have to choose Kryta. We can't act against the interests of Kryta even if we are acting in the interests of the rest of Tyria - even charr commanders swore that oath.
---
Anise remains at the side of the human queen while Bangar is off to become a disposable Frost Legion villain and the charr are being de-fanged by Smodur to act more and more like humans (with contemporary human vallues, overly sympathetic to the Commander and Dragon's Watch) and less like the warrior race they were originally portrayed to be.
---
GW2 will be a more interesting place if races like the charr actually act like they were originally portrayed and had some backbone to act in their own interests instead of the writers pandering to the Commander and Dragon's Watch's perspectives. It doesn't make them villains to consider Aurene a potential threat, or to want to rally and unify their race when they see themselves falling behind the established powers.
---
In the story everything comes to easily to the Commander, Taimi and Aurene, it almost never feels earned and the ease and which diplomatic challenges are just bulldozed makes everything feel cheap.
---
I don't think Bangar is about hatred of humans. I think he's about survival for the charr. GW2's narrative would be dramatically improved if there were more characters like Bangar who actually don't become villains.
---
I've messaged dornsinger with both sets of screenshots to ask for clarification on what anet's policy actually is. no response yet.
---
If you're in NA, there's u/nagennif who runs a guild for new people and likes to help newcomers on a more personal level.
---
Eh, he's got corrupted Jormag minion written all over his face. I give him till Chapter 2 before he's corrupted.
---
Because people like you are not trying  to push raiding but just worry about finishing it first try , all the beginners are runing away from this type of content and most of the type they can't even access to it because they can't try. Maybe people want to pull efforts into raiding ? And maybe the fact that there is an easy to do raid like can help them.
---
GW1 has the best dances of any mmo.
---
No, they are not.
---
But you still get that with every new release?...
---
So?
---
Would be a nice addition to the Nightmare Court... hmmm...
---
/r/GW2: "It'd be nice if we had more world-building and realistic, complex villains and anti-heroes instead of moustache-twirlers and characters that exist only to die. The story is lacking in gray tones and politics that make the world feel living and natural in favor of 'epic' moments with dragons that are bereft of any kind of personality."
---
Also /r/GW2: "I don't like mean Charr, hope he die"
---
In real life, villains win all the time. Having adversaries with clear motivations who can also be viewed as sympathetic when you consider their perspectives are key to good writing. It's strange to me that we've gotten *one* patch where the writing seems to have righted course onto the kinds of stories that made the first Guild Wars engaging, and immediately people want to jump ship back onto one-dimensional characters and plot contrivances that serve only to move from killing one dragon to the next. But I guess after seven years of this kind of stuff that's the audience GW2 has cultivated.
---
&gt; Scourge thrives on stationary encounters
---
More remarking this statement is not true in the slightest, given it probably has one of the least punishing rotations when bosses are moving, as well as the strongest Torment modifier (33% vs Ren's 20%). I'm not saying it's more meta than Mirage or Ren, but being able to maintain high DPS uptime during movement and/or ranged mechanics is Scourge's specialty.
---
Watch out for falling tanks!
---
You have problem with Louis?
---
have you considered that i keep bringing it up because people keep asking about it on cello's discord and pinging me about it?
---
Since when is Sanctuary useful? Only time is see it used is on bosses to deal damage to the breakbar or on some cheese builds in PvP. I think it would need a significant buff to deserve a elite slot.
---
The ghost in the background is like: "Okay...?". :D
---
I would love a warrior elite stance that increases all damage dealt, but makes you unable to recover health. At the end of the stance you would then gain the health you would have gained during the stance.
---
So you are admitting that you false-report him (anet allows but you reported him anway.). Nice.
---
Reminds me of Elijah Wood in Sin City
---
Heart of Thorns was made free to owners of Path of Fire a few weeks ago.
---
Yes indeed. Anyone who purchased or owns Path of Fire now gets Heart of Thorns for free! Announced end of last month, so great time to get back on. 👍
---
Arah is.....an experience of spaghetti coding
---
Kill switch??? 
---
Is this something that is exclusive to the human commander? I play a charr and Sylvari and never noticed that
---
not sure what you mean by my group. atm, thesource person is the one that keeps pinging me.
---
Thanks for that :)
---
Ok, then give it a buff. It was originally going to be an Elite skill, but then it was nerfed, and then they replaced it Renewed Focus.
---
I like the target cap increase they're going to add to it in the next Balance patch, but it should probably heal allies inside the bubble. Maybe reduce downed player's health degeneration too? Would fit thematically.
---
It's called diminishing returns.
---
It does not if you killed it in publix group mode. 
---
Please check your info before commenting.
---
The moas give eggs and occasionally poultry meat. I cleared an entire forest of deer, bear, and wolves and got some. They even drop from the rock dogs that follow centaurs around, if you're in the mood for some dog meat. (That's all you, bra)
---
Currently it is more a area control skill than a protective one. Its healing is not impactful enough for the cooldown. It would definitely help if it also healed downed players like necros transfusion.Personally I find the knock back annoying in its current form and would prefer if it only knocked back if walked into the edge like it is the case for ring of warding. For an elite I would like a reverse version of spell breakers elite. Remove conditions on allies within and prevent reapplication.
---
sad they didn't do the charr horns in the emote.
---
the fuck!?
---
he isn't even a-net partner lol
---
I made me toon sit on the throne like chair during the intro speech like he was a Caesar or something.
---
I clearly made the right choice in making my next GW1 character a necromancer.  I'll look forward to this dance emote later today!
---
well, I guess technically the reason gw1's dance is better than gw2's /rockout, is because the one on the left is an actual /dance emote. Whereas /rockout is more comparable to an emote like /talk
---
no i had 3 drop from a 4 enemy mob when i had already farmed 50+ and sometimes 0 from 10 when i first start the farm. it's just inconsistent and weird.
---
i can't figure out what the criteria is for some mobs.
---
Thanks for info :)
---
You didn’t specify that problem was only for public mode.
---
Please check your own thread before getting uncouthly sassy
---
If you can't afford to tip then you can't afford to eat out at a restaurant.
---
I wrote the following in another post, might as well rewrite it in a more succinct form.
---
With the way story unfolds so far, I think it would be a huge pity if Blood Legion turns into White Mantle 2.0 and Bangar becomes a more refined Caudecus. There is no denying that this prologue was amazing, and I am actually a lot more engaged compared to LW season 3. The sudden change in tone of the story, and how the ambient dialogue becoming more and more hostile (even towards a blood legion charr commander) were actually unsettling.
---
Yet I find myself distracted by the feeling this is the same trope we been receiving repeatedly in guild wars 2 since launch, albeit a lot more polished this time around. We have yet another conservative/traditional/xenophobic leader who has planted a rebel faction to antagonize other races. He has spies infiltrated all highly influential sub-factions and spread inflammatory propaganda. Then at a gathering, he saw his opportunity for a coup... I wish I could forget about Living World Season 3 so I can be surprised by the turn of the story, because I really wish we had this instead of Caudecus and all his daddy memes.
---
This is probably my biggest gripe with GW2. Sometimes it feels like about 75% of the antagonists in the game are built from the same mold; religious and zealous nutjobs that are sexist/racist/xenophobic. I'm not saying this premise doesn't make for good story but in GW2 it's repeated to a point I can't bring myself to take them seriously anymore.
---
I had a few dyes disappear from the guaranteed dye unlock choices, so yes, I think they moved some previously normal dyes to exclusives.
---
What!? He's already set himself up as one of the greatest villains in the game. Not only do I strongly disagree, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about... unless you meant more "I hope he dies because he's a bad person" I guess?
---
TIL... This could be useful when setting up squads for big trains
---
&gt;Please make it so people who queue for public Strike Missions are added to Squad

The whole post is about Public mode. The Squad mode was never mentioned here. So please, learn to read.

bangar - "LA LA LA LA LA I CANT HEAE YOU LA LA LA LA "

You only speak about public mode in relation to inviting to squad. If you’d said eg there are issues with public mode and then waffled one about these completely inane ‘problems’ then it’d be clear everything is only for public mode. But I’m glad you’ve realised that you can’t phrase things well and have improved your post, thank you

All I see is a huge green button to allow tracing me while I don't want.

Was it too hard to use some gif hosting site or YouTube ?
---
From what ANet has told him, random giveaways to Patrons is an ok thing to do, but giving guaranteed items is not.
---
But you know that ALSO is connecting 2 sentences? If you use ALSO, it means the sentence where ALSO was used, is talking about the same topic as the previous sentence. You don't have to highlight that you are not talking about different  topic.
---
I don't mind the lack of squad joining part, that requires someone to tag up anyways. Keeping it as is is fine, not a big deal.
---
But the lack of an exit option is so irritating. The quickest way is obviously to just character log, but I believe they can just add the leave-instance option easily. My guess is it's an oversight rather than an inability.

There's an exp bonus applied to enemies that have been alive on a map for a good while; in cursed shore, hunt sharks and other underwater enemies that no one ever touches to level to 80 in like an hour, from 75.
---
Sorry, i´m not native english.
---
I had no idea you could create a 10 man squad without a tag.
---
I am curious as to what happened to that "leave instance" button, because on WPs stream, you can clearly see one popping up (even with a big info window as if he would play a new character)
---
The male necro dance wil lalso show the weapon in combat ares. 
---
To show them with /rockout, you have to open your inventory and re-equip them.
---
If he joined via the squad option and not the public one, then it works there.
---
I also made my new wallpaper there. [https://imgur.com/a/KJE9BAu](https://imgur.com/a/KJE9BAu)

It's a realy gorgeous place.

Some kind of squad ui defintely needs to exist.  
---
With people not paying attention to map chat, you never know if a person is still doing the JP while we are all waiting, etc.  
---
Also would love an exit button.  The timer just seems a bit unnecessary.
---
My guess is that he'll capture Jormag, try to control them, get controlled instead, and turn the poor cubs he fooled into following him into the Icebrood Legion.
---
I think it is great if we have villains different from each other, be it their goal, personality, etc. Did we had a villain that majority of players actually disliked/hated to the core? Something like Joffrey from GoT (for example)?
---

10/10, I especially liked that you used the environment as your 'Spirit weaponry'. Easily the best look I have seen in this subreddit for a long time. Great job :)
---
You can leave the instance near the entrance by walking up to the guards (not the portal itself) — I think it was meant to avoid confusion with the leave instance button I guess? Or they're coded as dungeons? Seems deliberate is what I'm getting at.
---
While not automatically forming a squad is more or less fine for *this* strike, I think that if they add more mechanically intensive ones in the future there will definitely be a place for subsquad optimization. However, at the very least, I think they should be sorting players into a "Team" or something to have a localized place to chat and communicate other than /say or /map
---
Buuuut the real problem I have with the current system is that you can't partial queue with a squad of people. If I enter a strike via Public while in a squad, it's a free for all for random people to join before anyone in my squad enters. I haven't tested this extensively but there were a couple of times where I tried to enter with 5-8 people in squad and decided to go public to let some randos join in and the instance was full before everyone had a chance to enter.
---
It's a bit too much on the nose though.

She has her eyes on Divinity's Reach.
---
I don't know. Joko was a good movie villain. He's The Collector in all his OTT Jeff Goldbloom glory, or Poppy from Kingsmen smiling like a fifties housewife as she makes people eat their friends as a power move. Yes, he had a redeeming final appearance, but until that point he was something out of Thundercats.
---
(For reference, Scarlett was something more like a Captain Planet baddie... If she had a moustache, she'd have curled it as she tied Lord Faren to a train track)
---
Bangar, from what we've seen, is an allegory for racism and nationalism searching for a weapon to bring "his people" to some imagined glory. *They* have a dragon, so he'll get a bigger dragon. Rytlock has turned away from Bangar's ideals so he grooms Rytlock's son as his trophy. 
---
From what little we've seen, I'd say Bangar was a much more grown up villain.
---
Thank you for the kind words, I hate the videos that end up being a pyramid scheme in disguise. I hope this gives some people a reason to learn Excel as well, I have been using it professionally for years, it is one of the most understated tools on a computer in this day and age. Have a great day!

You do not want greens and yellows in lv 80 zones.
---
Still not allowed, when ever anets likes this or not trying to get a cut from that RMT
---
Damn that is gorgeous
---
this was ongoing for quite a while, just now someone hid a frontpage post in this sub
---
So a bunch of dicks :D
---
I still use bunny for going up vertical over skyscale, no random wall clinging, or running out of endurance it just saves time and hassle I use skyscale if it's not too high up and I know I can do it with out losing my endurance and falling back down.
---
GW1 has many small parts that are better than GW2.
---
&gt;Features like superfetch and memory compression are usually disabled by default for SSD drives. The meager speed up when loading applications in memory is not worth the extra strain on SSD drives with the added background write operations those features will cause.
---
Neither of these statements are true. Memory compression is a feature specifically designed to *reduce* writes to the page file. Superfetch is a use-based RAM cache, it's entirely read-based.
---
Please do not spread lies/misinformation.
---
You would be, if you're not, a good landscape photographer. The intuition is there.
---
Pros : Doens't require any time commitement, leveling is fun and you have tons of content to explore.
---
Cons: If you are an experiencied player there ins't much difficult/engaging gameplay at the end-game. The best cosmetics go into the gem store.
---
Can be both: Almost no vertical gear progression in the game, which means that end-game is almost purely for cosmetic items which can be a pro or a con depending on you personal preference.
---
So kinda my experience with Dota 2. If that the major downside I couldn't care less.
---
I wish I didn't recognise this quote from the prologue. That exchange was... disconcerting.
---
It really depends on what other MMOs you've played and what you've liked about them. The main distinction between GW2 and other MMOs is probably the combat system and horizontal gear progression system.
---
Combat is much more reactionary compared to other MMOs and has a higher degree of fluidity in movement. For example: Magic users are not locked in place to use their skills. Every class has access to their own self-heal skill and dodge ability to evade attacks.
---
The gear progression thing is a very different experience from other MMOs as well. You're not chasing after the newest ilvl every update. There are people who have legitimately been using the same gear for *years* and it is just as optimal now as it was back then. Instead, your core carrot to chase after are mostly vanity-based such as new skins or wealth-based incentives. There's a ton of stuff you can do in the end game, but because it basically boils down to wealth acquisition to create new builds / characters / vanity the appeal doesn't last as long as say a game where your gear is invalidated every other update.
---
this subreddit is salty af so be mindful of that
---
Both result in you stopping to afk and start doing actual events, so I don't see the difference here.
---
As for the penalising, it doesn't mean when something broken is beneficial to players, that it should never be fixed. Otherwise good luck getting rid of any exploit with that mentality.
---
"The ghost", that's Turai Ossa you potato sack.
---
Got the shoulder from bouncy chest. Which are the daily ones (non farmable) but I think I heard one report of "someone" getting them from the Physicals one. I would wait till we have more results before farming it.
---
About time! Now all we need is the music from core.
---
You seem to have reading comprehension problems.
---
a RMT seller making thousands in irl money legitimating his actions with a random GM ticket saying it is ok because its "supports positivity"
---
ah, thx for clarification!
---
Cello and partner? lul
---
Current owner is apparently a "God", doubts a few gold will weight on the transaction tbh :3c
---
Thanks for the detailed response. The only experience I've had is Neverwinter and the early game of EverQuest 1 and 2. I prefer games with good combat systems so if it's an upgrade from the games I've mentioned then I'm set. Community isn't a huge issue for me so I think I'll be able to tolerate it. Thanks for the warning though.
---
The caches were giving out Banner skins from the new LW5 map instead of Dragonfall loot.
---
proof GW1&gt;GW2
---
I like difficulty to a degree. If this is a game where I can log on and just chill with good combat then I have a feeling I'll have a good time.
---
Cello was arguing that Anet never told him to take the black lion skins down and the ghostly infusion was added after he took the legendary one down (for september subscriptions).  
---
He took them down when I pointed out that those are still guaranteed items in exchange for a subscription and for his own account safety, he should take those down until the support ticket he sent to Anet concerning the black lion skins received a response. He very reluctantly took those down.  
---
The random giveaways are still a questionable area since some screenshots of GM tickets are saying its ok while screenshots of other GM tickets are saying its not ok. Others asked if they could do something similar and they were told no because it was RMT. There hasn't been any further response when asking for clarification for the two opposing statements.
---
i like the gw1 one more tbh
---
Yw! I mean, I wouldn't style my own character this way but I think it still looks better than 98% of other characters I see in the game, and I can really see the effort you put into it. It's like a 9.5/10 for me ^^
---
I'm seeing a pattern in Thaumanova Fractal where a player intentionally starts the timer for the dormitories while everyone else is fighting Subject 6, and Chibb and Greeza die during the fight. The motivation for this is so that by the time Subject 6 is dead, the timer has elapsed and the collider door in the dorms is already open.  
---
While this does mean you skip a fight against some doors, you lose the [debuff](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Destabilized) on the Anomaly, making that fight last 11% longer (time that's spent over an instant death pit.
---
Is this actually faster? Or is it a greedy move pulled by players that can't dps a door?
---
For GW2? He is yeah, which I think is OP's point. He's still *not* the most complex ever out of any fiction, but he's better than anything GW2 has had is their point.
---
How so?
---
I'll be honest, and maybe this is because of GW1, but I could never take Joko seriously. He's always been a meme to me.
---
Hey man it’s the prologue of who-knows how many episodes.  You might need them later.
---
Not a fan of those crystals personally, too much glitter.
---
that'd be [https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Jorn\_Kudebeh](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Jorn_Kudebeh)
---
Nice try Anet
---
Nope, Great Ritual Preist Zahmut.
---
that'd be [https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Great\_Ritual\_Priest\_Zahmut](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Great_Ritual_Priest_Zahmut)
---
Why can't it be both? 
---
&gt; that doesn't give me or you the right to shame/make judgments about people who can't tip for whatever reason.
---
Look, I get it, but there's a still basic level of responsibility and judgment people can exercise and at the end of the day. If you eat out knowing you cannot tip, you are knowingly shorting somebody else's source of income. It's not like people can only get food by eating at a sit-down restaurant. There are plenty of alternatives that don't involve denying somebody else a decent wage too.
---
Renegades are Charr that want to keep warring with humans.
---
Sepratists are humans that want to keep warring with Charr.
---
should have included that in your post then.
---
otherwise its just a reference to a song and the guy who sings it
---
Dorn is the lead support GM. Unfortunately, I haven't received a response yet concerning the verification of the screenshots or clarification on other GM posts that have said otherwise. I'm ok with the policy either way. I just want the policy to be public so that anybody else who wants to do this has the same policy applied to them.
---
Wait until you need 250 of them for the new underwater mount saddle.
---
not the player, it's the weapon sound , very repetitive :) at least if you cast fire spells. I find it very irritating.
---
Nah, two ways to close or cancel the search, squad gets full,  or squad leader can manually end it
---
I wasn't making a comparison to the food service industry at all.  In gw, i always tip dudes giving out home instances,  teleports etc. In runescape it's so common jagex came out with an item people can put tips into
---
It costs 5 times less and goes along with every other currency being offered at 5x daily. If you want more go and actually farm istan meteors dude. Its like asking for diflourite cap to be increased to 20 because of how slow it is.
---
In my opinion it is not worth to sacrifice the damage buff. It takes seconds for DPS players to kill a door. It might be worth it to do it in low tier fracs, where the boss pops instant. But even then, there are so much more points you can save more time in fractals. And for like 99% of the fractal groups it would be better to save them.
---
I see him everyday in my amalgamate daily run, but didnt expected to join his group in lfg for today's strike mission.
---
I'm not that happy with multiboxing, but i have to admit it worked pretty nice with his scourge army
---
so, I should avoid signet of vampirism? did sound good on paper. \^\^
---
I'm guessing Bangar confronts Jormag and fails to conquer him losing most of his force, including Rytlock's cub, in the process and comes limping home.  
---
The question then will be does he admit he messed up and join the commander (bad writing) or Double down on his position and use the tragedy to try and rally all the Charr and only the Charr to his cause.  Even better, decide that all elder dragons are dangerous and evil, pretend to be on board with the commander and join us to attack Jormag, then at some opportune moment turn and attack Aurene.
---
That's such a weird gripe considering that all classes make sounds with their weapons.
---
At least Ele is varied since you have 20 different weapon skills to play with.
---
their is no confusion when it comes to combo's and rotation. its the fact that you took 4 Reddit post to actually be clear is the part that is dense.
---
[deleted]
---
I just realized that your name is Finnegan backwards.
---
People doing HP trains aren't the people complaining about endgame PvE and competitive game modes. The rest of the game is fine.
---
but they are not as loud and with each hit there is a variation but not with ele. cant play axe necro for same reason or gs mesmer. Unfortunately i have autism which makes sound/noise an issue for me... have to play the game without music too but no sound isn't an option either
---
Yeah the infusion use was great to make the char more ghostly :) Also the use of Spirit Smith, I don't think I have ever seen someone use it and look so good
---
It just seems to me that you and a few people are sour because he has been posting ways of making gold in game that hurts YOUR bottom line.
---
When looking into your reddit history is clearly shows that you have way more gold than any casual player could ever hope to gain in gw2, but now since more people are using these techniques you are losing your monopoly. IMO people who manipulate the trade post because they own more gold than 80% of the player base are the ones who make the game less fun and items hard to get.
---
Fair enough
---
Signet of Vampirism heals you when you get hit. You don't want to be hit nor should you get hit.
---
I mean I hope they'll balance themselves out at some point, but the drop rate does seem to be very low, even for just the high legion weapons. Similar thing with the Strike Mission skins, although I've had 2 squad members drop the shoulders so far.
---
For someone like me who really likes fashion wars it is a bit eh, because I don't know how many times I have to grind the same thing over and over again with no guaranteed way of getting the skins. Especially with the strike mission being so...unchallenging it just feels like very boring grind. The metas are fun, but I imagine they'll probably also become stale pretty soon.
---
That is a lol-answer, but is the correct one. Expecting to gear up, learn a rotation and be ready to raid doesn't work the same as in other mmo's. With some effort, you can manage it but the easy way is playing the game normally for at least a character.
---

Link for the lazy.
---
Are they actually available at Target? I'd love to buy them thru there but I haven't ever seen it in store and despite being listed as an authorized retailer, there's nothing on their website about it.
---
But they're both just emotes..?  Your comparison to the guitar toy would only make sense if the dance on the left was some equippable mosh pit toy.  It's "a full animation" only insofar as it's an emote that does more.    
---
I'm not saying it should have been the full GW Necro dance port, nor do I care, but the complaint I see is people being disappointed that they took *some* of it, clearly, and left the rest out, which was a deliberate design choice that's leaving some fans disappointed.
---
The Skyscale adventure is noticeably shittier than the others, though.
---
I gave up on that one, it's just unfun.
---
slap a grenth's hood and chaos gloves and you are good to go
---
I have seen him go through his characters one by one, and moving them individually. Are you sure it wasn't just autowalk? I only see one person agreeing, and no link to any evidence. It is possible to control multiple characters quite well even with the restrictions.
---
Ty
---
The shoulder skin is so nice... if it doesn’t drop for me soon, I’m going to end up buying it from the TP lol....
---
Thats such a bad joke it hurts :/.
---
same, I really want to play as one ( and not with a combat tonic anet, don't you dare )
---
you know that you can also buy the t-shirt from the vendor?
---
It is low because people gotta open the khan ur chest after all metas and i doubt most of people are doing that. Put that together with low tier chak egg odds, and you have the rarest item in the game
---
* Learn to dodge *through* attacks. Not away from them.

As a clarification of other comments: GW2 is a **skill** based game, not gear based. (The equipment cap hasn't been raised since Nov. 2012 and it is GW2 developer policy to never raise it again.) You do not grind Raids to get better gear so you can do better in Raids. You get better at Raids by learning the Raid and being a better player. Similar to Monster Hunter, hunts don't get easier by getting better gear. Hunts are easier when you learn how to hunt. GW2 is way easier than Monster Hunter. Player who are very experienced in WoW and  FF14 Raids say that GW2 Raids are extremely easy.
---
I think this is a great video guide for delivering information about setting up a spreadsheet but even though the information shown seems great, I have a hard time understanding it because the delivery could be better.
---
I already mentioned this feedback on one of your first videos and i will say it again.
---
Your delivery is way too fast. Keep in mind that many people of your potential target group are watching it in order to learn something, which means they are unfamiliar with the lesson you want to teach.
---
And in this case its not only the gw2 economy but also spreadsheets/apps.
---
You should still consider that at least half of your potential viewership doesnt have english as their first language and once you dive into lingo about specific or advanced intellectual topics, many of your viewers will be lacking the understanding of many words or terms because they dont even though them in their mother tongue.
---
I already suggested to make a subtitle by yourself but for this video, I just used the generic one provided by youtube and it actually was quite good, to be honest. It didnt get too much words you spoke wrong.
---
But still, you were talking so fast that even though I was able to read everything you said, I had a hard time computing it at the same time and nothing really sticked. Nevermind me not being able to pay attention to whatever the video showed while you were talking.
---
In general, even though its not my first language, I understand and speak english exceptionally well. I had 8 years of english lessons in school and worked in an international environment for over a decade where english was the working language, be it over in the states, england, during international projects on sailing ships and even founding for educational programs though the EU Commission.
---
But thew knowledge I am missing (in german or english) is spreads sheets and IT in general. I am no stranger to using MS office apps and I am not a computer illiterate but after watching your video twice, I still wouldnt be able to set up my own spreadsheet to be honest.
---
Thats it about your methodics about your lessons.
---
Regarding the content, I was wondering if you mostly use your own spreadsheets for your trading or if you still use other 3rd party apps on a daily basis for your trading.
---
Personally, my go to app for trading is gw2bltc because it offers the best graphs, sorting and filtering options with specific item based info or crafting costs just one click away.
---
The only app you mentioned was gw2spidy, which (besides gw2bltc and gw2tp) is probably one of the mostly used trading apps.
---
But it seems that you are only using gw2spidy for its API service, did I understand it right?
---
I only still use spidy for one feature: if you click on an item, it shows you which recipe including that item is currently the most profitable, which is a feature gw2bltc and gw2tp dont offer. Other than that, I fucking hate the illustration of the price/supply/demand graphs on spidy and gw2bltc delivers it so much better, apart from many other creat features.
---
The other 3rd party app I use on a daily basis is gw2efficiency of course but that is mostly for checking my trading post inbox and other stuff unrelated to trading. The trading post section on r/gw2efficiency just takes ages for me to load because my trading volume is so high and the filtering/sorting options in your trading history are awful as well.
---
Some general advice for posting in this subreddit:
---
In my opinion you are walking the line in breaking the subreddit rule of [advertising videos](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules#wiki_videos=).
---
So if you want to keep posting your guides here, I suggest you participate in some discussions outside your own topics.
---
I saw that you are also posting them on r/gw2economy and as a moderator of the subreddit I wont remove them. But you will probably catch more views here than there just because here is more traffic.
---
Nonetheless, I appreciate your effort and encourage you to go forward with your project, teaching other players about things you like and understand is always welcome.
---
Even though this video was the first one in your series that could potentially teach myself something as an experienced trader, as a content consumer, I would mostly be interested in watching livestreams (or recordings of it) from you showing your daily trading routine. I havent really noticed a twitch channel link of yours so I am not sure if you are doing that or not.
---
And as I mentioned before, consider making your API key public, even only for a limited time, so viewers can check your daily transactions and investments at their own pace. I think it will generate more viewers than theses guides on youtube.
---
Requirement for thousands of gold = more people buying gems or farming which keeps them playing or paying...
---
i thought it would mitigate a good portion of incoming damage \^\^ i mean you use heal if you get hit so this logic applies to all heal skills.
---
Dobby the house elf ?
---
The only ones it's truly penalising are the afk players, because their 8 pearls aren't enough anymore for infinite bonus loot. 
---
As for the active players, those boxes have simply become a pearl sink. Got all the rewards you desire but want to cash out those last few? Well now you can!
---
I mean, why does it even have a price tag to begin with, if it's supposed to be free additional loot?
---
Remember kids: You're not playing Blood Necro right unless you transfuse 5 allies straight into a bomb.
---
Just get Deathmagic and all the minions while leveling , easy mode .
---
I feel the same way about this, but I think the main issue stems from the new Khan-Ur helmets more than anything else. They're way too rare compared to the other items in the achievement given that they're only obtainable from map completion or the once a day meta. And even then its RNG to get it.
---
My only complaint about this patch is what feels to me an obscene rarity on some of the new items. The ebon shoulders seem alright, but the Charr specific helmet, the smoke shaman tonic and infusion all seem a little bit over the top silly to me. I love rare items and all but there are limits.
---
It also drops from map completion, but that doesn't seem to be making the problem any better. Either way, once more content this season starts coming out, its only going to get rarer still as people's attention goes elsewhere. This needs fixing by Anet.
---
I'm not 100% convinced he's going to be a full on villain for the whole story. Crecia is still unconvinced that he's all bad or that he isn't *trying* to do the right thing. There seem to be hints that something more is going on as well. If it feels a bit early to reveal the primary villain, maybe it is too early for him to be the main focus. Maybe he's being manipulated by Jormag or something?
---
I do like how the image of the Commander has changed through the story. Initially you're a fairly generic hero building up to killing Zhaitan with the Pact. After killing Zhaitan, and then Mordremoth, things start to sour, people no longer see the Commander necessarily as an all out hero. I think this is well presented in Joko's speech. Now with Kralkattorik dead and Aurene in his place, the Commander is a very divisive figure. Killing an elder dragon and then replacing him with one that favours you is an extremely powerful move. And considering that the rest of the world wasn't in the loop, it could very easily be seen as a threat. Consider that most of our big achievements so far have been destroying the biggest powers in the world. Since the Commander could now be considered the biggest power in the world (with Aurene) isn't it natural that other people now see us the same way we saw Zhaitan, Mordremoth, Joko, Balthazar, and Kralkatorrik?
---
either A. because people suck, B. Because he killed them with his weaver and cut off their epeen, or C. both A and B.
---
Maps are already calling it like that , gg awesome idea :).
