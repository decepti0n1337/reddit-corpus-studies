Wtf?
---
I'm trying but the instance Closes every time I open the Door .
---
&gt;One thing support had me do to attempt a fix was to change languages
---

---
That's what I'd recommend trying since support had me do it because it apparently can help resolve some instances of the symptom.
---
  
---
Sorry that wasn't clear.

This to me looks like a perfect depiction of what an engi main is going to be experiencing IRL in their late 40's and early 50's. Sidenote: someone get this man a cow
---
RTFM?
---
You get this toxicity in every single competitive mode in every single game. If you get it under your skin every time, then maybe multiplayer gaming isn't for you.
---
We have incredibly talented players on the guild you are in. You can ask them for help. I did many times and it was not denied.
---
You're absolutely right. 
---
There's a new generation of games that works to prevent this communication. Raid Shadow Legends has the AI play your team against another player. Even Hearthstone introduced a new game mode where you don't have to wait for people to rope or BM you. 
---
The days of games like this are ending and toxic people are the reason why. If nothing else, I think more games will move their chats over to small discord servers where small communities can manage the comms.
---
Anyway, after 7 years, I'm out.
---
We've known since Edge of Destiny that the Elder Dragons were not mindless, but intelligent.
---
However, you'd be surprised at just how many people still believe the "forces of nature" unreliable narrator direction up to and through Season 4. Even with Mordremoth, who they tend to handwave as being uniquely smart because he's the "Elder Dragon of Mind".
---
Even ArenaNet likes to push that unreliable narrator post-Zhaitan. Take, for example, when the Zephyrites showed up in Season 1. There was a Zephyrite teacher who said they were just forces of nature not giving thought to their actions. IIRC, the same was repeated in Season 2 and in Season 3. Because this is the typical Tyrian view of Elder Dragons, not the accurate truth.
---
But some players have issues comprehending unreliable narration.
---
So yes you can main multiple classes, in fact it's kind of expected that you have alts and GW2 is very alt friendly. For moving gear the gear would need to not be soulbound so *usually* this means ascended or legendary (yes there are some exotics that don't bind but they are uncommon). The issue is going to be that if you main druid and daredevil they both want different stats and sigils on staff so realistically you'd just want to make/get 2 exotic/ascended staves. Making a legendary would work as well but is expensive and you'd need to swap it back and forth every time you change character.
---
Seems like you're just unlucky.
---
I mean, titles!
---
I'm rich, you know
---
What do you expect them to do about lags that even extend to other games and services?
---
There is nothing they could've done about it. There will be no comment about it. It is out of their hands.
---
**Edit:**  
---
The Servers you are playing on are hosted by Amazon, which, as all data centers has to fight of big attacks from time to time. And in the past few weeks they (and others) have been hit with targeted attacks on a huge scale. Attacks on that scale also lead to delays and issues on/with services that aren't even being attacked, just because of the huge amount of data and/or packets that is being generated (and other issues).  
---
[Quick Read](https://threatpost.com/massive-ddos-amazon-telecom-infrastructure/150096/)
---
I’ve got everything needed for Winter’s Presence, except the recipe for Mischief &amp; Snowball. Tuesday can’t come soon enough, so I can finally craft this damn thing.
---
Aww, black-red flag and cocks. What's not to like?
---
Definitely don't agree. You can't give the important boons quickness &amp; alacrity (and resistance in PvP), and the others are easy for everyone else to apply.
---
This is the way.
---
Those who stick to zergs, and zergs only, don't need supply capacity as much. For those who havoc/roam it's imperative. I'll edit the guide later.
---
Look, I made this on a whim in 30 minutes and got pissed off at gimp in the process. It may not be as exceptional as Adam west's Batman, but youre gonna read this hot garbage and you're gonna like it dammit.
---
Damn son, don't cut yourself on that edgy comment
---
only cow i see here is you zag : ^ )
---
I can never be upset at a "look what I drew" post because those are people who are incredibly passionate about the game still, which is something to be encouraged.  That and it still requires more time, effort, and skill than what most people including myself have ever contributed to the forum as a "post".  Meme template regurgitation, on the other hand, I can see being annoyed over.
---
Get a log and/or video, and there are many places that will likely help. As some people mentioned, your guild. The [weekly question thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/eajihn/weekly_rguildwars2_question_thread_december_14/) will probably get an answer or two.  Also, I think most [Raid training discords](https://snowcrows.com/raids/training/), including SC's which isn't technically training, will help.
---
The most common problems are the right build, right gear, [right buffs](https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/)(check the "buffs" golem), right rotation(including speed, which can take practice), and practice in fight.
---
Yes, i allways look forward to Winter Festival. So much going on in Divinity's Reach. People everywhere doing events etc.
---
Should have at least one SB in the comp even if they aren't quite as good at their rotation.   Spirits still make everyone else's DPS better without significant sacrifice of their own DPS, so as long as they hit acceptable numbers even if not optimal for their class I'll take it.
---
"s'up y'all, there are currently some connectivity issues going on, seems to mostly affect *so and so*. the issue lies with our host and extends to other services as well. *you can now stop frantically restarting your routers and PCs, flushing your DNS buffers, etc.*"
---
followed by a simple "you can check for updates on the situation at xyz"/"we'll update you when the issue is resolved".
---
this thread isn't about them resolving the issue, but rather communicating about it. this would also work heavily in ANets favour, as just staying quiet about the lacking availability of your service will ultimately result in the general frustrations about the situation to be directed at them.
---
*however* OP is also talking about PoF lags, and seemingly not just since friday, specifically. there were several mentions over the past month or so about PoF maps being uncharacteristically laggy even with very few people around. these lags are unrelated to the connectivity issues over the weekend, are more persistent, and likely in ANets control, and as such there should have been a comment about them by now.
---
Is there any other way to get minstrel exotic armor apart from crafting?
---
I doubt they have to numbers to develop that, they barely have enough to keep the episodes going.
---
Anyway, about housing, players usually underestimate this system. Done well, they can bring tons of revenue into the game. Housing breath life into ESO and made it a fan-favourite game. I have played Runes of Magic for years (before gameforge ruined it). Housing was a main factor in that game. People were just enjoying furnituring their house as they wished. I sticked with Aion for it's housing. If Anet would replace the actual home instance and would introduce housing, it would be a boom, I can assure you. I know players who started to play ESO just for the housing. You can customise it as you want, it is just great. Housing was always a revenue-bringer for the mmorpgs. I believe Anet had this planned, that's why they wanted to add chairs as well, but now, I doubt they will ever introduce it. I can't wait to see how big is the next episode. In the meanwhile, they will try to keep the game going with more capes, some chairs and some month skins, but soon it will stop providing enough.
---
There was some talk about a patch that would nerf some condition classes such as theif and mirrage did that happen or planned or am talking bullshit
---
As long as they continue to add decos like they do for guild halls and also throw some into the gem store yes it will be enough for the casual playerbase of gw2.
---
It is too complicated for the actual size of Anet :)) We are lucky if they add some tables for the chairs they are still adding.
---
Start a character from level 1, and do the story, with a different race and class from the boosted characters.  That will help you learn the game.  After that, do more story, and complete zones.  If you need more challenge get on a boosted character and go to Frostgorge sound or the Cursed Shore.  Once that is too easy try some story dungeons.
---
You guys open for recruitment?  I used to love beetle racing but I haven't done it in ages.  Would love to get with a group that regularly races in game.
---
You calling other ppl virgins is implying that you do have sex..
---
Do you not even know what your words mean?
---
I just beat POF after a couple of years, excited to get my griffon soon!
---
The game is great! A ton of fun. There community is shit. Totally racist

Legendary mod. Thank you!
---
Yep.
---
They made another amazing mechanic, yet it doesnt do anything. It doesnt punish you at all, and people dont even care about clearing stacks anymore because there is no way you are going to get killed since you are able to self-break it.
---
Could you clarify what you mean by this comment? I'm apparently an INTP and I wasn't sure what "trait" that personality type has that is common in this subredddit.
---
Are there other alternatives apart from Verdant Brink?
---
Arena Net doing this to raid people. Ok so i guess it had nothing to do with people lagging out maps and instances all over the place and why they had to stop it. No? 
---
In my opinion the players abused the bug to a point were maps, instances and WvW lagged out and since they did not stop there had to be something done. So maybe moan to those players instead of telling Arena Net are the one to blame?
---
As far as I know, it’s periodically available. Or it's always available, i don't know and i don’t think it matters either.
---
Also, items in the gemstore are still obtainable in-game, there is no need to spend real money. Yes, it’s inefficient, but gold to gem conversion is a thing.
---
lol
---
what event is this?
---
Hmm, another post from a "returnee".
---
People that admit they haven't touched the game in years, some even pre-HoT, and yet they happen to come back during the game's lowest point and right after controveries over and over. Seems legit to me.

Nobody likes him either.

Meditation core guardian is as close as you are going to get. Marauder amulet, lynx runes. Just run 4 meditations +contemplation of purity. Tons of insta cast self heal, a bunch of burst damage, and absurd condi cleanse. GS+sword/focus.
---
Why not? If they have a right to post it, why can't I comment on it?
---
because they aren't being shitty, you are
---
\#5 If your fun is to become a Shining Beacon Light that blinds everyone at a 60 miles radius, you might going to get some fair opinions, just saying! xD
---
That's debatable. 
---
And doesn't change my question, why am I not allowed to be, let's say, shitty?
---
Sorry man, I hear the undertones but I don't know what you're referencing. Is shit fucked up right now?
---
They couldn’t even put together new elite specs after more than two years. I don’t expect them to be working on anything other than more story.
---
At first I thought you meant the writers .. but I agree.  We finally lost Taimi somehow and we're now stuck with Braham at the forefront. 
---
The commander's guild is a great example of why I play mostly solo.
---
Sigh ...
---
YES !! 
---
someone else sees it.
---
Thats known.  Resellers have banned people from using their site for multiple key purchases.
---
I run 5 copies on Nvidia 960, i7-3770, 32GB.  I run 4 of them 1/3 screen to cut down on power demands.  At 5 copies, Netflix will often stutter and stall so I usually put 1 or 2 into char selection after I'm done and CPU demand drops.
---
Note: a while back I found I was getting thermal throttle doing this and discovered my heatsink paste had dried up.  Still using a stock intel cooler too BTW.  Oh, I too use a small SSD (64GB) just for gw2.
---
381k gold only? at least you have some gifts for orphans
---
Haven't noticed any lag tbh, in PvE nor competitive modes. Haven't seen or heard anyone else having issues until this post. Are you *sure* this is not something on your end?
---
Agreed, I have one of those scripts that I run at Windows start-up.  It turned out to be malfunctioning.  So I hadn't looked in many months.
---
Adding guild hall content is a "sign"... That they are adding guild hall content.
---
How is this even a question that anyone needs to ask?
---
When is the last time you were in the PoF regions? There have been quite some topics about lag in these regions already.
---
But hey ... which class should I pick ??!
---
Just change the two daggers to two axes and you will be fine
---
Misread that as 'Reddit Downvoter'
---
Figured it was another tool in this sub.
---
theres absolutely no way that this isnt a priority for anet. warriors without banners are crippled and the massive buff to them and 10 other people is what kept it so long in the meta. itll take a couple of days, but its probably not on the backburner
---
Me saying other people are virgins literally only means they do Not have Sex. That does Not automatically mean i do have Sex. Do you not even know what my words mean?
---
Huh. I browse both reddit and forums every day and haven't seen any topics. But I haven't visited the PoF zones in a couple weeks either, so wouldn't know about that. Gotta check it out today.
---
Thank you very much, Kenny!
---
It's the best community so far, for every 30 awsome people you get 1 total *beep*
---
Check with hobbs and select the "I've lost something..." option. After that, check on gw2efficiency that it's not hiding somewhere else on your account. If both of those turn up empty, talk to support and ask if they can send you a replacement.
---
Pink fat male Norns with huge moustaches are the endgame
---
Maybe nothing, I also bound the class special abilities to other shortcuts, in some keyboards the F keys are too far to use them quickly.
---
I'm complaining about stupid people. Shitposting is an art in and of itself. 
---
Also, you're not a native english speaker, are you? I think I clearly kept on talking about me not being 'allowed' to talk shit. 'Allowed' implies there are consequences when you do something. The words you seem to equate with 'not allowed' is 'should not,' which are not the same. Ofc, I should not be mean. Except I don't care about what I should or should not talk about and I'm just picking on the fact you can't seem to differentiate between two clearly different words.
---
This script works for me 100% of the time, but I run it manually from a taskbar shortcut.
---
Who doesnt enjoy the furry sexparties in Divinity's Reach.
---
They are a 100% chance from armor and weapons. The cheapest weapons or armor to craft that are not one time collections or more important stat selectable gear (or the bad suggestion of precursor gear that needs LI which I assume you don't have or shouldn't use since you need dark energy) are shields. You can check the [ascended crafting costs here](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/ascended) but I would suggest looking at the [shields](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/ascended?filter.subtype=Shield) as mentioned before, specifically [The Twin's Bastion](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/calculator/a~0!b~1!c~0!d~1-85266) since it doesn't need other materials.
---
When I used to play gw2 every day in vanilla, I was solo clearing (or duo with friend) and selling the last boss, it was very profitable.
---
I'm against this Idea. GW1 and GW2 are two very different games mainly in how they are played but also what they are in its core.
---
GW1 is fully instanced in which you absolutely have to have other "players" in your party to progress. That is what GW1 is about and that is why it is called a CORPG. GW2 is a fully-fledged MMORPG so bringing Heroes or henchmen into the game would mean you basically play this MMORPG even more as a singleplayer game which is IMO not the way to go.
---
&gt; However, most of the days I cannot even find a party to run dungeons, maybe if I'm lucky I get to run AC and maybe CoF-p2 if the timing on the gate is right. people just count dungeons as "outdated content" and just forget about them, but it's still content! and it's lore!.
---
I hope you have submitted your own LFG and not only "looked" at the LFG panel because if you only did the latter then this is really not surprising. Last time I did any dungeon I submitted an LFG and the Group filled up in a matter of minutes and this is the experience of others as well, granted my experience is a few months old but there are still players out there that like to run dungeons.
---
Another thing is that this "outdated content" was placed on the same pedestal as "not worthy of running" which is just not true. If people would just accept that Dungeons are not officially supported anymore but that they A) can still be run and B) still give you good enough rewards then the whole "dungeons are dead" situation would look very different.
---
&gt; I never raided in GW2, I just couldn't fit in a group without them raging about me being a Thief and not a Daredevil, and so I never raided and with time this just gets worse because I'm playing since 2012 and never raided - I must be bad, so I never get invited, and it snowballs.
---
I think you misunderstood what raids are. YOU don't get invited to Raids but rather YOU have to look for a group to do Raids. Maybe that is the same issues with you not finding any people running dungeons? The players are there that run Dungeons, Raids, Fractals but YOU have to look for them. Unless you have friends no player will come up to you and say "hey u/DarkLord1610 want to do Raids?" And as easy as dungeons are whatever profession and build you can use in dungeons, Raids are a different thing because they need coordination and organization you can't just go in there with a crappy build and finish them or expect to get carried.
---
There also were no raids in 2012 but rather came after the HoT release, in 2015.
---
You need to bring the initiative to Raids in which you will need to get a build that fits into raids and was optimized for the raid encounter, that means you will not always be able to play any and every profession or elite specialization that you want. Then you need to learn the rotation of the build so that you are comfortable with it and can get a decent amount of damage out of it.
---
So, get out of your comfort zone and show a bit of initiative.
---
People can't handle the truth that you actually get good stuff out of raids 
---
But yea, nobody on Reddit seems to like them smh 
---
One of the reasons why I quit gw2
---
Wholesome
---
I realised that the spirits don’t pulse out the boons anymore. Is there a way to make the spirit pulse boons automatically?
---
No, the boons are on skill activation. In normal gameplay you're hitting the spirit's active skills every time they are up (besides saving nature spirit for reviving)
---
Really sincerely and not wanting to make fun or saying what you should or should not do with your time and money but have you considered that you may have some issues linked to gambling or compulsive buying patterns and that it's not that glorious to boast about having spent more than 7k$ on a single game. 50$ a month is roughly around the mark that shady predatory developer place the bar for people assigned the pejorative term "whale" so you being way over this makes me a bit worried that it may have had some negative impact on your life or that in retrospect you would find a very different place you would have liked to put these 7k$ on.
---
Again I don't want this to to feel condescending I just have verged on these kind of behaviours in the past on this game and others (or other situations) and I was just genuinely worried.
---
That is different kind of rp.
---
The fact you get new skills doesn't mean you have to use them. On the other hand, you CAN use them, but then you have to keep in mind they are subpar and get overshadowed by core skills.  
---
If you want to use (some) stances check the [boon-beast](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Soulbeast_-_Boon_Berserker). I am using is right now for Chak Gerent and only die if I am not paying attention at all. The permanent protection, regen and vigor gives tons of damage mitigation.
---
&gt;should take up only 1-5% of your total play time in the game.
---
I don't think one can dictate how I can spend my time. Especially when those numbers are completely erroneous.
---
I spent \~3 hours in the new map since the release (and completed all achievements). I've spent \~1h per day in fractals over the same period.  
---
So it's around 3h for the open world, 30h for instanced content (not even counting raids and strikes) over the last month.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Although, I think you misread what I wrote. I'm not even arguing about whether the content should be developed or not (And to be honest, I don't want henchmen) but about your claim that henchmen are not possible with GW2 systems because you don't know how GW1 henchmen work.
---
You know why? Because it is the only thing that keeps the class meta in group play. Always when someone says banners are super overtuned (which they are) they never realise that removing them will result in just another spot for x dps class that is highest at that point. Warriors are not required to do raids at all but just make a more diverse lineup for speedruns.
---
I would also like to add that since Staff is the new weapon you can wield with both Druid and Daredevil you will at the very least unlock a decent Exotic Staff when you start [training Daredevil](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Specializations_(Heart_of_Thorns_achievements)#achievement2272) or druid (slightly lower on the page of the previous link).
---
Then you also get to complete some nice collection for each elite specialization that award you an ascended weapon with a unique skin for this new elite specialization like [Bo](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bo_\(achievement\)) for Daredevil for not too much gold and time imo.
---
wtf is with Snargle in panel 9. WHY IS HIS EYE ON HIS CHIN!?
---
Damn that Snargle's creepy.
---
^(I love it.)
---
Aloof Ooof
---
They cannot do anything about it bullshit!  
---
Netcode and having the network running smooth is mandatory in any MMO. Telling they cannot do about it is just plain crap. 
---
This shit is going on for weeks now. Freezes, rubberbanding, hickups etc. Since the last 2 maps.
---
Super expensive Warbeast armor
---
Snargle has gazed so long into the abyss, that he decided to take it home with him.
---
People who say thief is trash probably don't understand this class and/or can't play it. There are mindless classes like guardian — just place a trap and watch mobs die or warrior (spinning around all the time dealing massive aoe bursts).
---
It is worth playing thief, e.g. Daredevil if you want more cleave.
---
This was good.
---
with for more content and features for RP players because they come with more immersion - and thats what I like
---
They are talking about love... right?
---
There is a roleplay category in the lfg tool. Join a party, join their instance, off you go!
---
There were a lot of really bad PoF lags since Halloween update at least(I've experienced them a lot). I personally haven't been in Elona in the past two~ weeks so I don't know if it's better or not. Seems like it's still happening....
---
Think they mean the kind of wrestling, mommy and daddy where doing
---
Yeah that one...
---
Where do you get that? I'd be really interested in one.
---
Well it actually is.
---
General Tip for every class:
---
* Carry a stun-breaker skill.
---
* Move around your target, you can avoid some damage only by moving.
---
Deadeye:
---
* Use 4th rifle skill as a combo field. Your bullets will inflict blindness.
---
* If you're fast enough, you can throw a Shadow Flare and use stealth attack between pulses.
---
* Malicious Restoration can be used as a condi cleanse (transfer).
---
Daredevil:
---
* If you have stolen skill "Throw Gunk", use Staff 5 over it's aoe. It will give you chaos armor and boons.
---
Revenant:
---
* Sword 3 can be used for evade.
---
Scrapper:
---
* Learning some combos can be helpful, especially these for healing, might and condi cleanse, e.g. use 2nd flamethrower skill over Medic Gyro's combo for additional healing.
---
Engineer:
---
* Shield 5 can stun your target. It's perfect for champs using whirling skills or other bursts and fast attacks. Just hit 5 and walk into it's hitbox.
---
Weaver:
---
* Arcane Shield is a great tool if you're casting a skill or you don't want to break your rotation for dodge (good for some Fractal bosses). You can use this skill without interrupting any skills and actions.
---
* Ride The Lightning doesn't make you invulnerable.
---
Low effort comment, delete.
---
Damn, Snargle's a smooth operator.
---
Not the answer to your question exactly but these are pretty good and the thief build isn't condi cancer (no pistol though). 
---
[https://www.godsofpvp.net/builds/thief](https://www.godsofpvp.net/builds/thief)
---
Yes I'm aware of core s/d I've played it for many years its pretty boring, s/p is ancient though in terms of viability so I would love to see it make a comeback so I am itching to see his build. I am pretty sure I know it based on watching him and knowing every thief traits, just wanted a confirmation really.
---
Nobody uses it unfortunately. I can't tell for everyone but I think it's because getting a group for RP like you get a group for dungeon - with clicking menus - is considered anti-RPish.
---
its a diaper, but yes i agree i hate it too
---
If you have access to Lions Arch , you can find portals to all the capital cities there :)
---
Thats your own interpretation. Ive only said you are virgins. Ive never said anything else.
---
The instances would have smaller player limit to avoid chat clutter (at least in cities and maybe the newest map). Obviously, if the map became full, a new one would open.
---
I don't understand the TT / Tequatl. It's "abused" already. People just come in afking 20 mins before the event start claiming the instance for the event.
---
You know who is a true hero of tyria? Our Mail Pidgeon.
---
Flying through the skies of Arah, Maguuma or the far shiverpeaks? 
---
NO PROBLEM!
---
Always there for the commander.
---
&gt; The instances would have smaller player limit to avoid chat clutter
---
If that is even possible. You would basically have two different types of instances for the same map. There is also currently no real identification (except /ip) in which instance you are that is visible to the player.
---
&gt; I don't understand the TT / Tequatl.
---
What I meant with that is that other players can force a new instance just by activating the switch. That means big meta events, which until now would need a map jump to force a new instance, would be shifted to those new RP instances which are not RP anymore.
---
So your "RP only instance" would be reduced to not being an RP instance at all because players would use it to get on a completely new instance.
---
Like I said, with the Megaserver system I don't think there is a solution to separate yourself from everyone else.

Join a RP meta guild to find ppl to RP with
---
IF the system somehow got abused by PvE players (I still don't see the issue) we could just have a debuff on the instance that prevents us from getting rewards, easy.
---
2/3 of the tech is already here (mentor, volunteer) so I think it is doable.
---
You know, this makes me wish it was possible to implement a 'photo mode' like with some single player games, where you can 'freeze' a moment and then move the camera around to get the best shot of it. We do have the Petrified mode from the box of fun - I guess it could be something like that, minus the rock/stone texture.
---
I am in RP guild but I miss encountering randoms.
---
Is 11k hp normal for dragonhunter!
---
I think you are a bit naive to think that this will not get abused. It will. Look at the whole banner situation at the moment.
---
Players have asked for being able to interact with instances for years now without any changes. Just the prevention of an instance closing is still a thing that hasn't been addressed.
---
I also think you are composing all of this as you want just so that it works. It is not 2/3rd of the tech available because:
---
* the mentor mastery is not to restrict or give you access to "special instances"
---
* the volunteer is a bonus to let you switch when an instance closes because of the low population in that instance
---
* you would need to implement a way for the mega-server to keep two different types of instances, one RP and one Regular with different sets of restrictions like less or no loot and fewer slots
---
* you would need to implement a way for the player to consciously see and change that instance on their own
---
The whole mega-server system would need to be adjusted because of this and to make it work. You would basically create at least one instance for each map just for the few RP players who probably not use 90% of those maps. There is no way to see which instance you are on. And the whole Reddit and support threads "I don't get any Rewards from the game".
---
Just for RP players to be left alone.
---
Don't get me wrong here, I'm all for a solution to this issue and that RP players can have fun in the game without getting annoyed by other players. Still with a system like the mega-server and the sheer amount of changes that would bring with it. Those things would have to apply to every player and the game itself doesn't know or cares about if you want to play RP and you want to be left alone.
---
I think there has to be another way to solve the issue but every choice you give the player that wants to play RP you will also give to those who don't. That might have worked with RP specific servers in other games like WoW but since GW2 doesn't have those there isn't really much that can be done here without changing the system completely. And I think that is highly unlikely for a relatively small part of the community.
---
The abilities you get as a Soulbeast is the mechanic of merging with your pet - that's what defines it - and you will be using it - and the skills the transform provides (f1-f3 skills). The access to mainhand dagger is a bonus, not the core, of the elite spec. This goes for any elite spec, and famously the new weapon an elite spec gets tends to be less favoured by the meta (not always, but often).
---
But, keep your daggers, if the stats work for you (or think about what stats you'd like them to be for future crafting/buying). For now, try one of the suggested builds until you're a bit more familiar with the game, and then you can craft yourself up a build using daggers if you want. It might not be min-maxed, but for general PvE times, it really doesn't matter - especially once you're more comfortable with how the game flows and you learn to react to things appropriately.
---
Make sure your gear is cohesive at least, and revisit low level areas if you need slightly less intense pressure to learn a build. Dodge constantly, and don't be afraid to bravely run away.
---
You can also get Black diamonds and other HoT jewels, as well as the unique exotics from Tangled Depths (Ebb &amp; Flow) and Ley Line Crystals for the Energy converter, collection items and cheaper Obsidian Shards. If you don't need the latter, I guess you can skip them.
---
No.
---
What else am I gonna play, the pve with 0 content? lul.
---
0 content is better then shit content, and pvp is a one big pile of rotting and toxic crap.  
---
Best mode is doing daily for no reason and quit to other games.
---
Just making sure that I don't get flagged for nuditiy for using the mini "mini failed attempt"
---
For me, this pvp is only viable when I'm drunk. I can't play WoW drunk, its too thinking intensive. GW2 lets me just get smashed and still carry with aids builds that literally carry the game. Best mode is pvp, IF YOU DON'T TAKE IT SERIOUS... big part of it lol. Or you'll rage yourself into a heart attack... pvp is atrocious compared to gw1 but pve is fuckin borefest lul as a thief I literal dodge and autoattack. NO thanks bruh.
---
I mean, the Japanese defeated lovecraftian hotties that way, so I guess we can gaze into the abyss and decide it's adorable as it gazes long into us.
---
Edit: Fuck it. That auto-incorrect is staying.
---
Except we can't send mail to our guildmates and our guildmates just use this communicator device now instead of the birds.
---
So if by "always there for the commander" you mean "never leaves," you're right.
---
Mildly concerned if you're armor actually *breaks* during it, though.
---
Need details on how u did that face

So i recently started to grind and i might've stepped into the progress with a wrong mindset. As i was assuming i would be making around 10g/hour. I tried silverwaste bandit chest train but i didn't even hit close to what i was expected to make.
---
Are there are helpfull guides to get me on the right track to start grinding gold?
---
Tru. Often ppl just don't know rotations as well.
---
What about koda warmth?
---
What classes share a weapon/ stats/ sigils with daredevil? Will I be put back by a lot trying to upgrade 2 weapons?
---
Warclaw have tons of bugs and none of them have been fixed and are more broken then working. And it is not rare bugs it is every day bugs on most players with the warclaw.
---
But we're being frozen by ice, not performing cannibalism.
---
This ^
---
I use it on all my alts and never have to go to PvE and do it unless i choose to do so.
---
i know but since the warclaw is involved in battles were you have several skills it is important that such mount works and that you can read them if a enemie is on it. It also is important that the skills on the mount actaully works most of the time instead of maybe it will and maybe it wont. Anyway not gonna go on you were not really after a discussion, just i am  a bit frustrated about it lately.
---
If the link /u/Fenryl-Saylem shared is true then our only option is to hope Amazon's code monkeys figure out a way to stop it.
---
Have axe/axe a try and I love it. Skill 4 to pull them all together and then 5 to burn them down is so satisfying 😁

The closest things to mercenaries are NPCs which are following you in story instances - they're dull and uncontrollable - they either attack by themselves anything within their range or "assist" whatever you pick as target and hit. Now, imagine how hard would be to make these more intelligent and able to do variety of mechanics (laser passage in CoE, bombs in CM, domes in CoF or Swamp fractal wisps) by themselves, not mention they would require adding the control panel, equipment, skills, traits.
---
Unless of course the GW2 mercenary would be a stripped down feature - your unlocked NPCs wouldn't have customized gear or skills, and instead these would use predefined core profession builds with let's say, Celestial stat gear and wouldn't do any mechanic but assist you as sophisticated NPC "[summon](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Summon)" in fights, not taking the party slot at all.
---
Still, it would be a lot easier to make dungeons attractive in terms of rewards which would make people run these again than write this mercenary feature.
---
Not true, I got it as well -.-
---
Just throwing this out there
---
if any bears need some wrangling well hmu some time ay
---
I see no problem here...
---
RIBA should give you about 20g per hour. Did you used max magic find boost for the chest run?
---
who requested those pictures?
---
FYI, there are two types of rich nodes - permanent that always spawns in same place like rich iron in The Gallowfields canyon in Brisban Wildlands, and traveling which may spawn in various locations. The traveling node spot may change or remain same till next visit depending on map status - whether it was closed by megaserver software or not due to players population.
---
If I recall correctly, there's one permanent rich node in majority of core maps (beside the starting zones) and at least one traveling rich node.
---
Jormag isn't real.
---
Okay actually one more question lol, is it worth buying the expansions straightaway or should I manually level a character to level 80 first or what? I know I want to play daredevil which I obviously can't unless I buy the expansions but I don't know if I'll miss out on a lot of stuff in the base game if I just buy the expansions now
---
Nobody ever.
---
Yeah. At most what they could do is something like the "phasing" used to change what NPCs and objects you see in the world.  
---
Enable RP mode, you only see other players in that mode. 
---
That or their appearances are 'standardized', like standard enemy models, but giving them the appearances of other NPCs of the area.  Like making them look asura in Rata Sum.
---
People were crashing instances, that's why they were disabled.
---
&gt; Please make it easier to unlock the Elite Specializations after you've unlocked it on a profession.
---
No. Unlocking an elite spec is already ridiculously easy.
---
Sounds like a less fun time with a less rich culture, if you ask me!
---
While I don't disagree with what you're saying, $100 a month is really very little for a hobby. It's a night out in a bar one day a month or a couple of pay per view sporting events, or a cable TV subscription. For a hobby that probably consumes a lot of your time, it's a fairly cheap method of entertainment.
---
I used to spend a hundred a month too (I've slowed down in recent years), but that amount of money to me is not much per hour and cheaper than most forms of entertainment.
---
I mean the guy saying I have to have it all is a bit concerning, but I didn't have to have it all and still spent that much a month.  If it were anything but a video game, no one would say a word about $100 a month.
---
Hell, there's a $27,000 pre launch buy in package for Star Citizen.
---
It was constantly bothering me the entire time, while I was working on this with finger paints. I'm definitely gonna see if I can order a new one.
---
:( I don't have it sadly. I am going ask around
---
What uncultured swines are downvoting this? Geezus.
---
This looks fantastic. If only the physical features and wardrobe/dye settings can be shared via chatcode like build templates. That would be great.
---
My mind says "yes" 
---
my wallet says, "oh jesus theres more"
---
Cape milking has officially started?
---
True, also it's almost Christmas.. which some of raiders will be offline spending their time with family and close ones. 
---
It sucks overall, it's doable to raid without banners tbh, just dps output from each class would be less then having a banner on the ground.
---
No, It's why i am asking around. Didn't know magic find was a big part of it and neither do i know how to max it.
---
That's true, my friend instances crashed.
---
The should implement an XP bar for gempurchases. After 100 million Gems we get an Expansion.
---
i think you do not know what edgy means.
---
exactly, thats what i wrote in my comment. thanks for repeating what i said.
---
Would buy if it didn't have those antler things on the side
---
Wait, I don't follow. Are you assuming this specific behavior was implemented like this *on purpose*?
---
It's a bug. Unintended consequence of transformations unequipping your skills.
---
Thanks man! Exactly what i was looking for. I noticed lvl 50 characters get much better loot so i might as well quickly level an alt to that level. You're a huge help.
---
Thats from the outfit that character is wearing, the cape does not have antlers
---
It is not a matter of coding, it is a matter of general research and of course there's always people working on an issue like that.  
---
Just like there's money to gain for some to have i.e. a botnet to bring down services, there's also money to make in preventing it. There is continuous research going on. And that's a worldwide effort, not only amazon.
---
Do you guys fell obligated to buy everything listed on the gem store? I have played for a little over two year and have spent maybe 4000 gems total. There is a boatload of stuff that I don't care for and kinda wish they cranked out more "new" items, &amp; faster. Is more options somehow worse? I don't get it.
---
So basically a VIP system?
---
Hello, I have nothing to say that would contribute to the topic of this thread but imma post anyway. Cheers.
---
Also there is already some things for RP, and that community is so small that i can't see how Anet will work on QoL content for this one when we already see all the game is lacking right now
---
Thanks for the awesome response!
---
I meant to say that they didn't devote the necessary attention to it. Of course, "things happen", but this important part needs to be checked more thoroughly - and they failed to do that.
---
"low effort"...
---
This has way (like... WAAAAAAAAY) more effort than 99% of posts here.
---
I'm Portuguese and I can confirm that this guy is Korean and he knows the shit ! :D

You have the right attitude for an artist. But I don’t like batman. GIVE ME BACK MY TWO LOST MINUTES!

Nope, its because we don't want the grief of guys thinking they are funny by spoiling our fun. So LFG without a vetting system of any kind is a big noooo for anybody actually in to rp.

Buying the expansions gives you a level 80 boost to use. It's an item that will show up in a free shared slot. It's always my suggestion to *not* use the boost on your first character so you can get a feel for the game and just explore. Leveling goes as fast as you want it to as well and can be done very quick if you're in a rush (but again I suggest doing it at your own pace). You should ask on here for someone to help you get a mount if you do get the expansions (there are spoilers in the mission so I suggest changing language/muting/going afk. I also have [a guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide) that you might find useful.
---
Now THAT is a great suggestion. And if the toggle would also faze out non-rp toggled chat. it be perfect.
---
Most of this isnt true. Server caps and map caps are hit regularly on EU. Which is surprising considering the numbers most of these servers can gather.
---
You can and do stress the mode by being leeching plebs. But dont worry, the mode is so neglected more damage is hardly noticable.
---
Well it's a good place to get several mastery points too if you're there a while so getting multiple things done at once is pretty nice. Also worth mentioning that things like fractals give a bunch of exp  for Tyria (*and gold*).
---
Oo thank you so much! I will definitely check out that guide
---
Check lists are not content.
---
I could make an MMO that has one mob to kill, with a level cap of 1 billion, and one achievement with 5 billion tiers for killing it 50 trillion times, and absolutely no one would say that game has almost unlimited content.
---
Check lists can be a good way to encourage you to do something more than once, or a way to include rewards to otherwise mundane tasks. They are not a replacement for actual content.
---
Complaining about stupidity on this sub. Really catering to your audience I see.
---
First - doublecheck that you didn't actually complete that portion of the collection. Then, What Khorren said!
---
Oho! Ne inum!
---
Gw2 is being turned into a validation simulator. 
---
Everything has to be simple enough a trained monkey can do it, yet also has to be rewarding as if you achieved something. 
---
Anything that actually requires anything... Literally any requirement be it experience, class or role, able to communicate in any way, skill, ... and it's considered elitist and evil. 
---
The fun part is... I think many of them realise half these achievements arent to write home about. Thats exactly why theyre posted. So others reaffirm the idea that you're "amazing" for achieving something designed to be unfailable.
---
Which healer spec/class excels in Heal Over Time?
---
I mean you're not wrong. Gw2 is a race to the bottom and the community only gets more and more... entertaining over time :)
---
You actually don't need dark energy for the refined (=raid precursor Armor) envoy sets
---
Where are you getting 60 plus unlocks for an elite?
---
It's 250 HP, if I recall correctly, or 25 expansion map challenges.
---
With mounts, and access to both HoT and PoF maps, this is easily done in a single evening of gaming. Hell, I just decided to try out druid, so I reactivated an old ranger alt I never use and even without any of that trait line unlocked, and green and yellow mismatched gear (most of it not even level 80), I was able to bang out the entire druid line in 2 nights.
---
And that wasn't even talking advantage of all the "commune" HPs. 
---
One thing that I'm still mildly surprised by is how many people still go around maps unlocking elite specs with HPs. On any given day, you can go to VB, AB, and the first three PoF maps and just ask for help on map chat and likely get everything you need.
---
If you really can't get it done, and you're on NA, add me to your friends list and if you see me online, send me a message and I'll help you out. After the communes, several are soloable but become even easier with just one more body. Usually when doing HPs, I also happen upon others doing them too, allowing me to knock out a few harder ones while I'm going for the easy ones.
---
you don't see how people buying items equal or better than raid and fractal rewards can be a bad thing?
---
according to gw2 efficiency, i have spent 20 times as much as you on gemms  (mostly because i'm bored and have nothing else to spend gold on) but its just not satisfying. Exciting and prestigious loot or rewards are just so rare in gw2, if i had alternatives to the gemmstore it would not be an issue (imagine legendary fractal cloak with unique effects, or well, at least something new added in last 3 years)
---
I'd agree with you in roughly 50% - the community doesn't get more entertaining because white knights ran out of stuff to shit a week after the last ERP. Now it's the same reused shit (from both sides), but hey, it's better than overworking yourself, right?
---
Chibi Snargle smiling while being clanged over an anvil is absolute perfection.
---
You have some interesting beliefs.
---
The devs havent shown passion for the game in half a decade. Outside of the people who WANT to see positivity no matter what, players wont trust them. They wont trust them because they have a history of consistently fucking up.
---
That's what you could have learned from wvw. Especially behind closed doors, where hating anet is common and has been for a very long time. Just like anets abuse of the mode ;)
---
Quick question and maybe a bit off topic: Isn't on December 17th when the gem store goes on sales?
---
Eh, most of the armor skins from the gemstore aren't that great. Just like, 1 or 2 per weight class. Outfits on the other hand, and black lion weapons, have much nicer looks than a lot of the stuff you.earn in-game. That said, for best shiny weapons there are legendaries, and most gem store weapon skins don't really compare.
---
They already said the capes were the hardest art project they've done, and that they can't add dye channels to existing backpacks. But going forward they'll be adding dyable backs.
---
whaddaafaaak.  you could pay people to raid/dungeon with you :D
---
Me: they're drawing out the capes for as much money as they can.
---
Also Me: I'm going to buy every single cape they release.
---
There's games that do that. Usually called a loyalty reward, every threshold of cash shop currency spent gives you a nice reward as a thank you, most often titles or flairs.
---
Firebrand Regeneration, Symbols and Aura is kinda a passive HoT.
---
Renegade can HoT with Kalla ulti as long as he can support it with energy; problem is that Kalla requires your teammembers to attack while also standing inside the AoE. So if your team gets CC'd or is unable to attack there is no healing **at all** what really fucking sucks so hard you wouldn't believe it!
---
Tempest also have many different effects. Same as Druid or Scourge ... 
---
Imo only a Firebrand can really HoT his team, just standing besides him heals your HP - no active input required. Regeneration only ticks once from the healer with the most healingpower so if you run Harrier your Regeneration Boon is not active until the Boon provided from a superior healingpower-healer like Minstrels/Magi runs out.
---
I would say Scrapper
---
I wish I bumped into other Roleplayers ;_; I'm on EU tho, maybe we are less numerous here.
---
To everyone browsing this thread, take a look at mine: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ebcvc1/roleplay_instance/ and leave your feedback please. Lets make (random) RP great again!
---
100$ for one night in a bar ?  I would never pay more than 20€
---
The boneskinner is a terrible idea for that reason, but he's on to something. If it spawned an elite or vet icebrood when you get frozen, that'd be crazy.
---
you could just search for a guild to raid/dungeoning
---
People get annoyed with these types of posts but I love it because it shows the game is still getting new people into it. After you do X stuff, you lose sight of how awesome it felt in the moment. I don't think it's valuable to get annoyed or angry over people reaching legitimately big milestones for a new player.
---
I don't pity dumb people, I am annoyed by them.
---
Also, after erp we lost a few big names, so 'toxic elitists' became a faceless evil, instead of being a group of dipshits following words of a some british rano asshat from twitch who is raiding for fun and talking about the state of the game, so the situation changed, because when you have an uniform blob you can't use any new arguments
---
Anyone seeing the Jahai Shatterer being run regularly in NA? Last thing I need for the Vision achievements, but had no luck finding a group this weekend, just a couple failed attempts.
---
"Abuse" is what happens when you add gamebreaking bugs to your game.
---
Just like "exploits" where people salve shit they buy from vendors. No shit people are going to do it.
---
Gw2 has no theoretical debate, next to no build craft, balance or speculation.
---
Its catering to fluff and content that requires no knowledge, no insight, no puzzles and no challenge. Usually related to world building, immersion and story. 
---
Soooooo... :)
---
Watch out, guys. Big brain over here.
---
it's an anti afk mechanic, like the distracting bombers.  The bombers don't hurt the shrine, just the people sitting there.
---
besides weaver and dh, i can't think of any dps build that can compete with slb burst and fractals are all about burst since phases should be under 10s even in slower groups
---
more than insane burst, slb is extremely meta in fractals due to stance share and frost spirit which makes them quite common..so yea not sure why you never meet them
---
can they stop with the giveaway only skins please?
---
I disagree, Dishonored is really good, but he should consider playing the original trilogy of Thief
---
There’s a term for that, *festive*.
---
We spend time in different place . A single beer here costs 10€.
---
The cold never bothered me anyway.
---
Aurene isn't real.
---
Everything was just a dream and simulation of 3rd to 5th Dimension about memories of our "commander" character that seeing a vision. of the future.. fighting to survive in the deep dreams of this nightmare.
---
I enjoy the animation to draw and put back my weapon tbh :O might be just me.
---
I use Cap as the key for doing that and always put on and back my weapon while running haha. Never knew the DH thing sounds fun
---
Are you retarded? Yes you get good stuff out of raids, but it's not worth at all to salvage the raid precursor....like really?
---
That's true, I woke up today and everything was a nightmare to see no banners 😣
---
Nah you dont really. People that would like nice rewards from raids already drown in ascended gear. We dont really need any more of it.
---
It's not like they didn't code their own game. Just because they haven't done it doesn't mean they technically *can't*. 
---
It's a stupid argument because there are a lot of reasons why they haven't, and it has nothing to do with whether or not they have the ability.
---
Ah yes, the challenging group content we've come to expect.
---
What can we buy that's better than raid rewards?
---
Well.. I might never meet those problems as I’m too poor and don’t have any friends to send me gold in game lol
---
Lucky me :(
---
That Charr looks really cool! Also nice work.
---
New player here, some traits count against "weakened foes" "chilled foes", does opponents with resistance also affected by conditions still count as those above?
---
That can only be solved by RPers themselves.
---
At most there could be some sort of "group" system separate from guilds, like the "Communities" in Diablo, that have no player limits but no guild services, letting them stay in contant without having to use up guild slots for it.
---
Looks really cool! Could you tell me what armor parts you used?
---
2 weeks ago: yay capes!
---
Today: boo no more capes!
---
I'll keep an eye out, Thanks!
---
It's the same cape model, right?
---
You should have the waypoint for Shaemoor unlocked.  As someone else said go [here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Village_of_Shaemoor) and walk north and you will find Divinity's Reach.  The wintersday festivities are all located at the crown pavillion which is on on the west side of divinity's reach.
---
Nah, i just get compulsive to correct the coward that their use of a word is incorrect. You don't affect me enough to get annoyed. And I don't have PTSD, thankfully.
---
What exactly is the problem with encountering random non-RPers while RPing? In non-city maps, the only concern I see is non-RP costumes but even that is a small issue. If the problem is the lack of in-character dialogue between you and a stranger as you meet an objectives, so long as they don't start talking you should be able to filter them out on a personal level. Imagine how many people you randomly encounter IRL that you don't bother to interact with.
---
Not sure if sarcastic or just stupid. Either way your comment is low effort and needs purging.
---
Every GW2 twitter video I try to watch is a pixelated mess, can't even see where the cape starts and the outfit ends.
---
&gt;Mist games you play content to earn skins
---
In most online games? Hardly, and the trend is towards item mall skins.
---
&gt;Edit: What I mean by petitions is actual support tickets, requests, whatever you want to call them.
---
Well that is not a petition then.
---
Any examples of things that have gotten "ignored"?
---
Ye im gonna wait for a stary or yin-yang type cape.
---
Very.
---
i still didn't get my ice bound mastery even tho i completed story with 2 characters and sent 2 tickets :)
---
So I got an item that dissapeared from my inventory from some reason and I'm trying to contact them but they don't answer at all xd.
---
Yes.
---
They have a blacklist.
---
Your name is on it.
---
As soon as the system filter finds your name, it auto deletes your ticket.
---
Have a nice day!
---
Oh damn, the downvotes.
---
Do not send multiple requests or you might be swept at the very end of week long queue, with every new ticket you've sent.
---
And yeah, we are talking about 3-8 day long queue.
---
Wait is this true.
---
For a dissapeared item.
---
Sure, they could make "new" versions of them, but the amount of work it would take for 0 profit makes it unreasonable to do. I can understand that, I just wanted to at least have the legendary backs dyable. 3 skins, all I ask.
---
keep believing there's gonna be another expansion if it keeps you happy I guess
---
Sorry but dollars speak louder than reddit karma.
---
Honestly yes. If I knew they were working on an expac and gemstone was funding their work I'd be more inclined to open my wallet. As it is I  buy a few things here and there and gift things to friends.
---
you can type "/wiki et" ingame in order to open the window of all timer based meta events if you want to know where to go :)
---
Make one support ticket and wait for them to respond (assuming this is a legitimate support request).
---
The worst thing you can do is create multiple support tickets.  Have you thought about how the system works?  Every ticket you create adds to the length of time before other tickets get responded to.  By spamming multiple tickets, you are making the process take longer.
---
Be patient.
---
oh.......it keeps me happy all right......positively thrilled!
---
And how long have you waited..?
---
NO
---
Sell any expansions outright. No shenanigans.
---
There’s winners but it’s also available in gemstore right? Not another fucking aurene Outfit shit. Still bothers me you can’t earn that anywhere
---
Another one that stopped but is still here complaining
---
 &gt;As of today, I'm still (reasonably) paranoid that our money goes elsewhere, i.e. other projects.
---
A large portion of the money goes to investors. That's just how capitalism works.
---
little content? dude... we are getting a new map, a new strike, a new story, new weapon skins and new collections with every release of the "saga" episodes.
---
it may not be a lot compared to other games but damn its a lot compared to what we had prior to this so id say thats where the money is going to lmao
---
Trying to ride the blurg was a terrible scene.
---
First of all. Gw2 holds a special place in my heart. I’ve played this game since gw1 and have spent many hours exploring Tyrian my opinion on the game is just as valid as yours. I want it to succeed and am very sad they are just resting on what could be a fantastic product
---
All money ends up at the NCsoft.
---
Beautifully done.

I did some T4s on my warrior yesterday. It wasn't so bad. With the sheer amount of boons that gets stormed out by FB, we managed to go through 99 &amp; all T4s with Warr, 2 Necros, 1 Druid, 1 Thief. Think we failed twice on Siax, but everything else went smoothly.
---
It's OK, my husband beats me less than he used to so I shouldn't complain.
---
It's OK, I worked really hard for a whole year and got a 5 cent raise but at least it's more than last year!
---
Yea...no.
---
Isn't [SCUM] the guild that used to troll/grief world events?
---
No. It's a personal guild my roommate and I made years ago and we are the only two members. It's basically so we can fuck with various guild features without having all the interplay of a large guild.
---
Have the same problem since today. Yesterday worked fine for me buut today I can rarely log in and always get disconnected right away.
---
thats alot of words used to describe 2 hours of content =))
---
if all you do is to complain YOU are the problem. i see improvements beeing made and i'm happy about it so they deserve a little praise and trust. if they keep this up while still releasing QoL patches from time to time i don't see how this is supposed to be a bad thing unless all you do is try to find something to complain about
---
would it make me more happy? no. the company has lost all my trust. there could be a literal bar within the game and i wouldn't trust its validity or accuracy. the only thing i believe in at this point is what gets actually delivered. only considering what has occurred since S4 ended that hasn't been a very trust inspiring experience.
---
and then you can have a whole other conversation about how such a practice could be (ab)used to inspire a guilty conscience in the customers and fans behind which ANet's management - which is afterall primarily responsible for all the BS over the last few years - could hide once more. no thank you.
---
Until they don't, because bad publicity has spread too far and wide. We already see people asking if they shouldn't invest in this game in the light of recent events.
---
new strikes -&gt; done in 5 mins each
---
new story -&gt; 30 mins
---
new weapons skins -&gt; skins aren't content
---
new collections -&gt; While i don't think endlessly running around in circles counts as content, i will give you that: i had a good hour or so with the new collections
---
We played for two days after the last release and for an additional 30 mins the following weeks for each of the strikes . (Farming the mastery exp needed for it took the majory of the time)
---
I just wanna know whats planned in general, whats going to come in 2020 and the future, when its rdy is just not enough.
---
I agree. I’d prefer a solid price for expansions that I could just buy, but if they really are anti that and said they would use money from gem store on expansions I’d be way more willing to buy stuff every couple of months
---
Of course not.
---
I am not buying gemstone stuff to get expansions: I buy expansions to get expansions.
---
And if expansions are not dropping, then I am not buying anything.
---
I have got a small video on my youtube channel with my flying over and getting like 7 fps because of it. If anyone is interested in it for some reason, let met know.
---
All of them.
---
A roller Bettle.
---
actually managed to reach and beat the only combat encounter in the entire ~~first episode~~ first half of the episode in under 35 minutes. it was neither a speed run, nor was i skipping dialogue (imagine that was even possible).
---
the "2h of content" meme was never as dangerously close to being entirely accurate at this time, and that is *including* almost all achievements.
---
i didnt say it was a lot of content tho xD i said it was MORE than what we got in season 4
---
You do realise you reset all phantasm skills with heal signet? I try to do my shield 4, then swap to focus and use focus 5, then do heal signet to do another focus 5 and when I swap back to shield that one will be up aswell.
---
No it is not. You do not play anymore so even if  you are not interested in current state of the game you cannot decide for its future.
---
And it is a fantastic product
---
IMO capes are the perfect cosmetic item for the Gemstore.  I enjoy the emblazoned, but will pass on this one.  P*lease make an evil looking cape Anet**?  I.e., a shadowy/whispy Spawn-like cape, or a Maleficent/Snow White Queen cape.*
---
False!! I paid for the game and therefore my opinion on it is valid no matter what! I have probably spent more money on it than you and you have zero ability to tell me I’m not validated in my opinion. Ciao
---
When i started out with raiding lfg was pretty full  with groups looking for every kind of boss. nowadays lfg is full after reset and afterwards its about 3-4 groups during prime time and like 3-4 sellers + recruiters. if that is a thriving raid community i wonder what i witnessed then
---
petitions are not what they are there for, however, they have actively ignored / stonewalled valid support requests in the past that were concerning unjust bans and were definitively proven wrong in their stance that the bans were justified.
---
Looks fun.
---
at least 2 mini raptors
---
Good call! I'd love to get the Tyrian and Elonian Scaled Drakes too, the Tyrian ones have such a funny head I love it, and the Elonian ones look badass in that uniquely crocodilian way!
---
Shocked we did not get a poison field in the smogscale or another fire due to living in draconis mons honestly
---
geez imagine having to play the game in order to play the game
---
Cow
---
Thank you, I'll focus on them, since I can't stand WvW for longer than 30 minutes at a time.
---
When you put money into the game only to find that those resources were diverted to other projects while the main game is being left to rot on a skeleton crew then there's no point anymore. So no, i wouldn't trust them at all to do that and ofc the gemstore can go F itself.
---
You should Try Wildstar then!
---
Or World of Warcraft/Final Fantasy XIV with their Subs Fees!
---
...But I saved him...
---
Same 
---
Actually ive never even experienced lag spikes since 2014 in gw2
---
After haloween i have like 4k spikes 
---
Games started to disconnect to character screen
---
Insane lags with low ping,like 5-7 sec spell delay and finally lags on mostly empty maps at 9 am on monday 
---
Actually when i played on us wow servers i had around 120-140 ms ping
---
And mostly 20-30 in eu gw servs 
---
Now it jumps from 70-200 and i feel like playing in a bottle of oil
---
Expansions also increase revenue by hugely promoting the game and bringing back players (old and new) who will spend even more on the gemstore.  They are also a chance to even release new stuff on the gemstore like what he have already, glider skins for HoT,mount skins for PoF. The advantages of an expansion go way beyond the 30$ you pay. It's a long term investment that yields more profits in the long run than adding small things over time like the LW seasons do.
---
I've noticed there's a ton of them in D.R., almost everywhere. Sometimes it's nice to stop by and see what stories people are forming
---
i'd like to see each mount as a pet for ranger, they all looks strong, all of them can also be tamed, so why it isnt a thing already?
---
In my house with modest DSL, I discovered that the kids having Facebook open but in the background was consuming all of the UP channel cause ping spikes as the infrastructure throttled my UP traffic. I was using a ping monitoring tool at 1-second intervals aimed at several DNS servers. Turning off those sessions cured the problem and ended the throttling.
---
You realize it too? I've never played PvP in these 7 years of GW2's existence. Guess you play games to compete with others, meanwhile I play games to relax, casually have fun, without time limits. Today I soloed an open-world champion in Bjora Marches and finally finished coin collection achi in Grothmar Valley (without guides).
---
The outfit isn't even that good. It's a blue shirt with the same pattern as an Aurene shirt that you can buy in real life. And it's blue rather than white but other than that, it's nearly identical to the HoT and GW 2 logo shirts.
---
So I just crafted Twilight and a few hundred gold away from crafting Sunrise.  I am going to put them up for sale to buy Eternity, but I don't exactly know how much to list them?  Do I list it as the least amount of the current sell price?  If I do that I could end up waiting a long time as others come in lower?  I don't want to waste the listing gold to pull it down if it gets buried.  What are some key strategies for listing these type of items?  I guess for that matter buying as well.
---
Thanks for the information.  That's what I was looking for.
---
Would be cool to have a bland cape that doesn't look like a napkin on Asuras. So far the two released gemstores cap not only lacked the possibility to have the guild logo, but they were way too fancy for my liking. I just want a normal cape, or even a weathered one.
---
&gt; a new strike
---
Raids and fractals have died for this "Glorious" new feature.
---
Wildstar, heh. Thanks, but I love Guild Wars franchise and wanna stay.
---
Path of Exile got you sorted. They have recently released yin-yang type cape.
---
Quaggan gonna foo up your day.
---
Saddest part, the "in game cape" is not even a cape, it's half a cape, that looks like a kitchen rag.
---
I've said it before... Expansions have to make up for dozens of people working multiple years and they cost about $50.
---
A mount skin is a couple artists and modelers working for a week or two and sells for $20. The gemstore mounts will win every single time... especially because you'll STILL need those to cover the cost of an expansion (see: glider and mount skins).
---
It's all about money and if they thought they'd make more profit from expansions, we'd be getting one.
---
No because expansions have a separate price. Gem store funding goes to funding ongoing living story development hence why its not really free despite what people like to assert.
---
Yeah! Totally agree with that opinion... :) Would love to see more of these!
---
In Anet's defense, they *are* a very small studio with only one relevant title, and they do keep pushing out free content regularly into a 7+ year old game. And there's gold to gem conversion, which can't be said of many other MMOs with larger budgets behind them.
---
They need revenue from somewhere, and as nice as new in-game cosmetic rewards would be, they don't bring in direct cash.
---
As Ranger main since the days of “touch Ranger” (and also a gw1 pvp player in old days)
---
For gw2 new pets... 
---
I would love to see another PvE title linked pet like the Gw1
---
“Rainbow Phoenix” (took 10 Maxed pve titles) 
---
And another PvP earned pet like the Gw1
---
“Hound of Balthazar”  (took 100k Balthazar and only pvp titles would raise your limit that high.. base was 10k).. that one was special to earn for me for sure
---
Alright, this is coming from someone who bought Anthem Special Edition on release and joined the soulless wailing over at r/Anthem. (YMMV)
---
Yes: if they confirmed an expansion was in the works and the Gem Store was funding it, I'd be happy and patient. It may not cause me to buy anything more, but at the very least it's a step in the (PR) right direction that it's not just a cash grab.
---
Alternatively, I would even be happy with them going back and adding extra episode content (Season 1, Malyck and the 2nd Pale Tree, Single Player Story Mode Dungeons/Raids, explaining who the heck Diarmid/Gwyllion/et al are, revamping the Zhaitan fight, etc., Dungeons of the Mists--like Fractals but uses the old dungeons. Uses Core Mastery Points for the AR or something). It still counts as "new" in my books. Hell, for a bundle, I'd buy a 1/2 expansion price just to get these ones. Nothing else required--just revamp some of the old stuff and make it relevant.
---
Just need something positive and hype. The train has been parked for so long and the painting of Colin's smile is wearing off.....
---
Make your own party.
---
Since when is DH not meta?
---
There’s probably more to the story because dh is in the fractal meta.
---
DH is like the best dps build, what are you on about?
---
No one is using the in-game tool because it is cancer. The communities exist outside of the game. I thought the same thing about the raid community until I joined the Raid Academy discord. Now I can't get the thing to shut up.
---
I've been having a lot of issues with Thief, personally. I play just about every class, and recently that includes thief. I was originally leveling it properly, but I decided to boost it to 80 because I wanted to experiment with things.
---
Now, for the sake of a theme I'm going for, I'm avoiding deadeye for this character and specifically looking at daredevil and core thief. Woodenpotatoes has a video that illustrates the strengths of thief in open world, with his open world dead eye video.
---
However, coming someone trying to tackle the class for the first time, I would say it's one of the more irritating classes to play just in a general pve environment. It's very squishy, it's utility skills have generally high cool down compared to other classes, and it relies on active gameplay for sustain, as opposed to other classes.
---
The thing is, I actually really love all those aspects. I like the overall design OF thief. The problem I'm having is that the fuckin numbers are just too god damned low across the board on thief. Just truly abysmal, unless you are playing dead eye, which can just unload into enemies over and over again. Looking at purely core thief and daredevil, the damage just isn't there. I have tried a huge variety of builds, and spent a few hours experimenting with build craft, and even with all the dippin and dodging and clever plays, etc. it honestly feels like I'm doing twice the work for half the damage.
---
Compared to my fresh air tempest ele, or my spellbreaker warrior, or reaper, or even my holosmith engineer (which is glass as fuck), I just do abysmal damage. Really don't know what I'm doing wrong.
---
A Kodan. And charr. They are basically wild animals..
---
Whether you're trekking through the valleys of Kryta, climbing across the icy peaks of the Shiverpeaks, wading through the burning hot molten lava of Titan's Throat, swimming in the wet depths of the forgotten and forbidden temple of Abaddon, or just chilling in the ephemereal protomatter of the Underworld, he will be there for you. Your dearest, longest pet, the carrier pigeon.
---
Are you on Longbow?
---
Dragonhunter is meta, Longbow is not. 
---
You have to understand, people aren't forced to play with you. Just because you like a build, doesn't mean that others have to accept it if they feel it'll slow them down and make it harder for everyone.
---
It's group content, so you owe the rest of your party trying to play a proper build to make it easier for everyone, because in instanced content everyone depends on each other and a dead weight drags everyone down.
---
If you want to play weird builds, make your own group and let others know.
---
If you expect a "real time" response, then you'll be waiting for a while. Some tickets can take a day or two for them to get to, and it depends on the severity of the issue as well - people not being able to log in is more important than something you most likely deleted "on accident". Have patience.
---
I'm playing DH with Greatsword, Sword, and Shield (sometimes focus). Is that improper enough of a build to warrant insults in the lobby?
---
I might have joined one that asked for something specific, but all the terminology is so confusing to people who are unfamiliar with them.
---
No longbow here. Only greatsword, sword and shield.
---
the entire endgame of guild wars 2 is skins and fashion because theres no vertical progression with gear. when you put all the skins and fashion in the cash shop in a game like that, one could make the argument that it is pay to win. also, you can literally buy gold with money which is what you use for everything in the entire game lmao
---
Need level 80 to unlock story for level 80, ídem for 70 to level 70, 60 to level 60 etc...
---
karka
---
Did you fight Zhaitan yet?
---
It's just random enough. He wants pick-up RP with RPers he hasn't RPed with before, outside of guild RP. Not hard to understand.
---
any backpack that has a dyeable glider counterpart could easily be made dyeable. it already has a dyeable version because the gliders are the same damn model...
---
&gt; it's not that I hate the recent (2017-2019) aggressive gemstore practices 
---
Okay, but these practices are poor whether you are okay with it or not, and they already funded hidden side projects in the past with no explanation or previews available to the community. You already know this.
---
Secondly, I can only point out that previously they have said that gems help fund the game going forward, but we can already see in the past history like HoT that they not only had more funds coming but content ceased to come out for a long time after release. Just look at the cancellation and renewing of legendary weapon releases... You already of your answer that Anet cannot be trusted.
---
How am I unfriendly by being kicked out of the lobbiy before the Fractal even started and not saying a word? Specifically for this one I joined it said T4 Daily Rec, which I assume means Tier 4 Daily recommended? I'm not sure.
---
You unlock story chapters every 10 levels. So at 10,20,30...and final chapter at 80. After Personal Story there's Living Story s1 recap, s2, HoT, s3, PoF, s4, and Icebrood. You can only play those if you have the chapters unlocked.
---
I have done all T4 fractals on a condi ranger. Maybe this obsession with meta builds is an American thing.
---
Skale.
---
I've done all fractals up until 76. I know pretty much all bosses aside from the Chaos Observatory.
---
I'm not expecting people to accept me no matter what. A simple "Hey man. What are you running?" 
---
Is miles better than no words exchanged and a removal from the lobby.
---
Nobody argues that. Anet is currently the lesser evil of game companies, and I'd still like GW2 to keep kicking.
---
nah, only CM's and very few T4 groups ask for a "Meta" build. I used to run druid/dps (mostly druid) and had 0 issues. They only kick if they ask for a specific class (Alac/HB/BS etc) and you bring something else and refuse to leave, no pots (if pots are asked for, you should bring them regardless) no food, and asking for ess. I've seen very low dps (1-3k) and no kick.
---
I play with traps since the single target damage is absurd.
---
Thank you so much!
---
Then I'd say it was a a dickish group who probably wanted to add in a friend of theirs? Don't sweat it, fractal pugs are rough these days. Maybe unlock firebrand if you have PoF...so you can join as a FB and if they already have one, swap to DH. It takes the exact same thing as DH gear wise, with a few concentration pieces if you don't feel comfortable with a low boonshare %.
---
Rock dog would be redundant as it is already on ogre runes.
---
Call me biased, but where's my goat pet at? Jokes aside, I always hoped for [the Colocal](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Colocal) to become a Ranger pet one day. Basilisks would be cool, too. There's quite a few cool monster/beast designs in the game.
---
I want a snek
---
And they say Gw2 community is *friendly*
---
I'm using traits focused on greatsword, traps, and sword.
---
A pet that would singlehandedly carry ranger's DPS, allowing them to safely pew-pew from a distance and die to random AoEs. The pet should, of course, persist through ranger's death, and be able to be revived by other players. The ranger would then be essentially obsolete and could be safely removed from the game.
---
So, if an item is on sale in the gemstore, and that item allows you to unlock an emote now .. doesn't that mean that they're selling emotes? Am I missing something here or ??
---
Yes, because a summon is the exact same as a ranger pet.
---
Nya, please be gentle, Nyarlahotep-sama~
---
**Of course** the gemstore funds future content, though whether that content is actually termed "expansion" is a semantic matter.  What did you think they were doing with that line of cash flow if not using it to make their product?  Seriously dude...
---
We need a fucking chumbo, and maybe is a little unfair for other classes but since we need to search pets could be nice if there is some legendary pet(with normal stats but like awesome pet)
---
I tried going Firebrand once. Even converted my ascended berserker armor to viper stats. But I felt I was more of a liability than when I was playing Dragonhunter. So I chsnged back to berserker again.
---
I give you 5 miniraptors of Hot as a pet for raping all enemies xD
---
Monetisation is not evil unless it falls into p2w or is based around gambling boxes. My objections to GW2 monetisation are mainly threefold: its not sufficient in terms of providing consistent funding for the game; the RMT aspect leads distortions to ingame rewards; and it skirts the line of being unacceptable in terms of gambling boxes.
---
Jotaaarooo kisamaa
---
Well hb = heal firebrand -&gt; guardian spec like the dh, alecren = renegrade -&gt; revenant spec.
---
They might just ask for boon + heal. 
---
Dps = dps Class
---
Generally for t4, if you want a smooth run, you want 2 suports (hb+ren or druid+chrono) and 3 dps (doesn't matter which, most group won't care unless you doing less then support)
---
Drink milk, removes all conditions and heals tou, sometimes can gives you stomache
---
Try a build like [this](https://discretize.eu/builds/guardian/power-dragonhunter) or [this](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/dragonhunter/power/), with those weapon choices, and have a go at the DPS Golem in the raiding lobby? See how much damage you do. 
---
It's odd you get kicked on sight though - pretty sure that means you joined a group that needed something else! Make sure they're asking for a DPS, not a "BS" or "Alac" or anything like that. Don't be discouraged, you'll get there eventually!
---
- a full pack of pocket raptors
---
- skelk or skale as both aquatic and terrestrial pets
---
Has the main open world build changed for Ele? I saw the trait changes to Tempest trait line and figured that permanent Overload Air uptime has to be pretty good.
---
I tried checking MetaBattle but those guides seem unchanged since last time I checked them (before the patch that changed Tempest traits).
---
Blish was a great plot but I wish Anet would throw us a curveball with him. Kralk is dead so it would be a plot twist if we *went back* and saved him as the mists should be stable-ish again.
---
Calm down there Satan, we do need to give elder dragons a little bit of a chance.
---
Insults are never warranted, but you should improve your build nonetheless.
---
I have kicked a ton of DHs from my pug T4 daily groups. Not once have I kicked them for not being meta. I kick them because they always drop dead first, and they usually use glass cannon builds but don't have the muscle memory or know-how to avoid most of the easily avoidable incoming damage. Assuming this applies to you:
---
If you want a "friendly" T4 daily run, then make an lfg for "Casual T4 Dailies". You will get people who join your group. It may take you over an hour for your group of casuals to do 3 fractals, but if you don't mind then it should be a much more pleasant experience than playing with speed running experienced players. Many players who do T4s daily have done each fractal over 50 times, and it no longer becomes fun to play them. It starts feeling like a chore you just want to get over ASAP for that quick gold. So when some dead weight pug slows down your team's progress by 15+ minutes, then that pug will have bitterness coming their way. Please just don't join any groups saying they're requiring "ess" or advertising that they're looking for "exp" players. Doing so will annoy both you and the players you're inconveniencing.
---
Actually on POF humans are treated differently. They have to explain how you are immune to certain effects. It is not as extensive as hot is for sylvari but it does exist
---
You people are ridiculous. You do know there is Gold to Gems conversion right? Therefore everything is earn able in game. I bought the first gemstone cape strictly from converting gold..
---
Ctrl+F "Otter"
---
I am disappointed.
---
Agreed, in the very least let us have one of the various, standard deer that roam about Central Tyria. The Rock Gazelle's abilities (when merged as Soulbeast) even resemble a white tail in the images!
---
I'd add that I'd like to see more Iboga and Jacaranda varieties since GW1 had a variety, and I guess more plant creatures in general, but the time for those might have passed with the end of S4
---
Crab.
---
Nah. I've spent enough money on this game and their shady business practises over the last 6 months buried any chance they will get real world money from me; apart from a full expansion.
---
Once they monetised the Build Templates, that was it. I hope the loss of goodwill and reputation was worth it for them.
---
Sand Lions are also fairly rocky

You said most of it isnt true then refuted one thing. Am I wrong for saying players that want to help and actively work towards that are welcome? I said as long as they do something productive they are good to go, which means they wouldnt be leeches. Its far better to have someone taking camps and tapping objectives than another player afk repairing walls.
---
Love me some solo Arah speed runs. This was some of the best content back in the day, and probably still is honestly.
---
THIS
---
I would have like to at least find a trace of his body inside Kralk. It feels like we never acknowledged his sacrifice on the later episodes.
---
I want Aurene as my pet :(
---
I'd trust more an actual literal crowdfunding page or some NPC that collects specific gem donations for a cause than a message like that.
---
Not the same.
---
You mean 100%
---
Yes you are missing something here, because the item is not about the emote it unlocks, but rather about the dance party you can have. The emote is just a bonus, that was added recently.
---
Personally I like it quite a bit. And I’m any case it’s that there’s something that can’t actually be earned in game any way at all
---
Oh man, that sword -&gt; MI at the end was beautiful. I was wondering why you were looking up when you were in there solo, then BOOM!
---
How far did you push on the refund? If not far,  you should should ask to escalate it to a more senior person. 
---
They pretty much scammed you.
---
I would feel different about it if i could fucking buy what i want to buy now that i have the money,and not in god knows how many months. Let me pay for cool shit goddamnit. False urgency clearly hasn't been working out great.
---
I second a pack of pocket raptors.
---
YAY

I think once you break out of the ice, it should take you down by only like 5 stacks to 15. If you get frozen too many times (2 or 3) you die.
