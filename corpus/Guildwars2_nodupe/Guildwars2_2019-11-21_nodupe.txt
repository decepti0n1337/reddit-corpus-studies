Name one time when Anet has done any kind of changes to already released maps apart from gamebreaking bugs.
---

---
They just let Kourna rot.
---
---
---
What I mean by that is that the icon is easier to see when the GUI is scaled down or the there is such a large pixel density that the outlines get so close that they look like they touch. By adding white space and remove detail you get more of the core essence of what the icon is trying to convey, and will still  look clear as it visually becomes smaller. Whole that is good in general it is especially helpful for people who have poor vision or impairments. Furthermore it's done to make itself more unique of an icon compared to similar ones in it's space. This allows users to find and access the icon easier. Yes we all know where the icon is and it hasn't moved, but your brain still takes a moment when your eyes move to take in and break down what you are looking at. The more distinct and clear an icon is the faster users can find, and discern it's purpose.
---
Or at the dev team decided they want to go a different style and are slowly deploying new components piecemeal so the transition isn't as harsh from a day to day perspective.
---
I remember at release there was no portal into bloodstone ten from VB but they added one a few months later
---
something you will read about in a blogpost or a story and never in the game
---
I cried when Trahearne died, finally, my efforts might actually be acknowledged as the real person who got stuff done
---
It's a very common bug that happens when something with GW1 blips. You can either log into GW1 and visit your HoM, or just wait it out (like a day or so) and it will fix itself.
---
Training raids wouldnt be content on their own, their purpose would be getting people into regular raids.
---
Realistically, training mode wouldnt drop LI, wouldnt give existing kill achievements and would give slightly less currency.
---
I think some of that is basically people putting in solutions in search of a problem.
---
I'd like to see Anet drifting away from memory lane for once and go to a new area.
---
This is called giving candies when something's not fine. Candies are good. Problems still remain.
---
I think it's an unspoken truth that putting the burden of all of the magic of the elder dragons onto Aurene is a recipe for disaster. If they are a natural part of the flow of magic, it would like cutting down your immune system by 5/6ths and then expecting the remaining 1/6th to carry the weight.
---
My personal theory is that Jormag things we're being very useful killing Elder Dragons (their competition) and replacing them with newer, younger beings (like Aurene). Keeping the Norn alive to kill other dragons in the future might've been their thinking there, perhaps they plan to take us all out in one fell swoop. I don't see them being truly benevolent with how much damage the Icebrood have wrought.
---
It looks more child friendly, which worries me.
---
&gt; Yes. That is what I said. I "don't count the fuck-ups" because they are completely irrelevant to how I enjoy the game. When they fuck up something I do care about, 
---
At this point I honestly can't tell if you're underage or insane.
---
I agree that there's a difference of 'mind control' between the two. I think the difference between Mordy and Jory is that Modremoth wanted to forcibly enslave you, Jormag would rather have you agree with them and willingly join their side.
---
Modremoth forces you to work for him. As a sylvari you were mentally violated to the point of physical and mental pain. Modremoth pressed down on you until you decide it's just easier to give in then resist and be in constant pain. Then when you do, you're not that all there anymore.
---
Jormag is more subtle and not really all that forceful.  With frequent, but small, psychological reinforcement, not forcing opinions but u. It uses your friends/family, people important in your life, etc (their voices and hallucinations) to belittle you and poke your insecurities, but uses his real voice to 'comfort' you. Jormag is slowly warping our perspectives to a point where everything we thought was right was wrong and vice versa. If that sort of emotional manipulation is happening everyday, all day, it's only a matter of time before we would actually start considering what was said, then our perspective gets warped. Eventually we will end up thinking that Jormag is on our side and only wants to help us.
---
With Modremoth, you are no longer yourself, with very little awareness of who you were. With Jormag you are no longer yourself, but you yourself were the one who willingly lost yourself. That's what I think. Not so sure on what Modremoth gave to Jormag in terms of magic, but a greater phone reception might be it xD.
---
So you have no proof that then just up and ban ppl for what you claim?
---
Ok just concede and go away son.
---
Do you have any idea of why i just have a black screen in game?
---
Read through the post, I enjoy the difficulty increase. What worries me is the casuals won't engage and raiders won't see it as worth the time.
---
&gt; I like the light puzzles. Those are new.
---
Interact with object then follow the the moving blob for 3 minutes?
---
That's not really a puzzle. That's more of a just... walk for 5 minutes-zzle.
---
There is a collection with exclusive rewards (Raven scepter, dragonrender helm) tied to doing all the restored boreal weapon though. The other option being the WvW track.
---
Cant tell if this is sarcasm....
---
Nothing, really.   
---
Just a Lot of people feel that she's a very poor representation of Chronic Illnesses.   
---
As she's never limited by her illness, has to take meds, mentions treatments of any kind.   
---
But only seems to bring up the illness for shock factor and Pity points.   
---
Which could be a writing issue, who knows. But seeing it more properly represented would probably ease some of the hate
---
It's okay if you don't like it. Others do. See how this works? Do you know the age of the average computer gamer? It's somewhere in the mid-30s.  People have jobs and lives and responsibilities. So the last zone had a boatload of shitty grindy achievements. You consider THOSE SPECIFIC achievements an improvement over this zone?  Okay. I don't. I think the achievements in the last zone were overtuned and overdone and annoying. I prefer the achievements from this zone. See that's how opinion works.
---
Should change after to the floppy corpse on the ground :x
---
none need more build templates. at least u do small changes manually. we did this way for years and had no problem. first world problem....
---
The Trading post is faster because there are fewer people using it.
---
No, it doesn't, lol. It means a small subset of the people who cared about the game have moved on. Game will go on just fine.
---
Wow, I didn't know they were being serious with the [2017 April Fools patch notes!](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Game_updates/2017_April_Fools#Raids)
---
Yup. I been wondering this as well. :(
---
When they said "Lovecraftian influence" I think they were just referring to this episode.
---
The name of the title is a reference to a Lovecraft story in which an alien puppets a dead human and speaks to someone else through their body.
---
That literally already happened at very beginning of this episode.
---
I think Jormag was trying to be "friendly" by smiling, but it ended up just being on the list of creepy expressions I hope I will never have to see again.
---
Honestly, I was seriously deliberating whether or not to trust Jormag. I don't know if it's just the whispers getting to me, but I feel that we should just hear what they have to say, but I feel like this is just the first step to getting manipulated and losing your bearings. Though, I have a feeling this is exactly what the Commander is going through.
---
Yeah but where is the expansion level content they promised? Dont tell me the new masteries, because the only thing that changed is the colour from purple to blue.
---
Just checked, mine reset as well.
---
My mom always said it's not the size that matters, but how I perform. In the case of last episode neither are impressive.
---
new 2k gems mount skin, duh
---
I've been attacked
---
There was also something to the right of the TP icon but I can't remember what.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/search?q=best+gem+store+purchases&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all
---
Sylvari commanders do have a specific response - I think when Braham and I were talking about the voice my character said something like "It reminds me of Mordremoth, but different..."
---
So it was nice to have that recognized.
---
IMO, if you have a proper support of irregular resolution in games (especially old ones) - it means that there was a nit-picking developer who imposed a technical challenge on himself just for the sake of it and applied scalable solution. My huge thanks to the people like that, but not everyone bothers with it.
---
ATM ultrawide and omegawide monitors grow in popularity and we see the same stuff which happened a bit more than a decade ago when 16:9 started taking its market share - many games struggle with supporting uncommon resolutions. I have the same monitor and it amazes me, how bad some games do. RDR2 cannot be run in lower res even with aspect ratio scaling mode, rendering simply breaks. Tons of games, even if they allow to set uncommon aspect ratio, are locked into 16:9, and have black areas at sides (Sekiro, DS3, Hollow Knight and such). Thankfully, there are third party solutions that still can remove this limitation, but for Sekiro, for example, it's no longer supported =/
---
Many games even if they can be rendered in 32:9 - UI is all over the place. UI elements are anchored to the sides of the screen instead of being set at some offset from center, so you have to twist your neck to keep track of health an ammo, and then turn your sight 90 degrees to see minimap.
---
So we just live in the unfortunate era when developers struggle to adapt to newer technologies. We are early adopters and have to suffer the downsides of having a bleeding-edge tech. Hopefully, in a few years the situation will change. But ATM even ultrawides are possessed by marginal amount of people, let alone omegawide samsungs. AFAIK, only 3-5% of steam users have 2560x1440 resolution, vast majority still have Full HD.
---
&gt;Yeah, got this tip from my sister. 
---
Where'd you get the rest of it? Or is it *just* a tip?
---
\- Loves Charr - What's not to love? They're heavy metal cat people!  
---
\- Buys Gems - Yep  
---
\- "Thanks ArenaNet!" - Seriously, I love what they're doing  
---
\- Hates PvP - Never really been my thing  
---
\- Loves Living World - Not all of it's execution, but yeah. Love it   
---
\- Bad at Fashion Wars - I mostly buy outfits and call it a day  
---
\- Hates Raids, never played them - I've been playing MMOs for around 13 years and have never found a way to make them fit to my lifestyle  
---
\- Thinks the story is really good - Yep. Shoot me.   
---
\- "WvW?" - Generally not a fan of anything that requires people losing for me to win, with few exceptions  
---
\- "If you don't like it, just leave." - Yeah. I do this constantly, then come back when something interests me.
---
10/25!  
---
The rest:
---
\- Only plays one build - Nah, I like to switch it up once in a while  
---
\- "raids are toxic" - Didn't know that was a thing people thought  
---
\- &gt; Downvotes you - not really my thing. I tend to indulge the unpopular opinions to at least hear them out  
---
\- Never played GW1 - Guild Wars Nightfall will always be my favourite MMO chapter. Among my favourite games of all time  
---
\- Cried when trahearne died - I'll admit I was sad. I always felt like he got more hate than he deserved, like Kormir he was just badly executed, but a pretty cool character  
---
\- Thinks fractals are too hard - not really, depends on how far you get with them I guess  
---
\- Catmander - What is this I don't even?  
---
\- Pays for build templates - I don't think they're worth it right now  
---
\- "Imagine crying over free content" - It's not free  
---
\- Never played a dungeon - Played all the story mode ones, and a few paths  
---
\- rare and masterwork gear - Exotics :D  
---
\- Hates humans - Humans are great :)  
---
\- Only presses one - Jokes on you, I play with a controller! (only presses right trigger...)  
---
\- Has all the mount skins - I've neither the time nor the money  
---
\- Loves Tiami - I love Felicia Day, but I'm pretty neutral on Tiami
---
That was fun :)
---
&gt;  We just seem to have finally reached a tipping point where the subreddit users unsatisfied with the game are outweigh those that are satisfied.  
---
  
---
We reached that point, again. It's a cycle, really. People get dissapointed, negativity peaks on this sub, circlejerk about negative circlejerk starts becoming more annoying than negativity itself, dissapointed people leave.   
---
Back to positive circlejerk, untill ANET fucks up something new, and we're back to square one.
---
&gt; Just a Lot of people feel that she's a very poor representation of Chronic Illnesses.
---
Nah, it's not that. The complaints I've heard: 
---
•Asura solve everything through deus ex magic.  Taimi as a main NPC gets the bulk of this for the story. 
---
•Her demeanor (super chipper, etc) is grating to some.  
---
•Golems = Computers = Too modern for fantasy. This includes some of Taimi's dialog. 
---
Taimi's has some moments that were well written, including representations of her illness. I still get maaad about the scene at Dry Top. And there's some very existential drama about what she might try to do to preserver herself when her body breaks down.
---
Worked for me. Make sure you click the 2nd "redeem item code" box in game. (US)
---
I got an Ice's bite drop, too. But I finished the collection months ago. Seems to be another bug
---
There is also the question if extending the map makes even sense gameplay wise. The meta events are already there and I don't see them being updated to include the next part of the map. So if they extend the map without any proper interaction between the two parts you split the players of a single map into two.
---
I think if they do expand a map it will be a map which is clearly designed around it. Or they have a very clever and secret idea already for this map which we don't see.
---
[https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/802982/#Comment\_802982](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/802982/#Comment_802982)
---
&gt; Perhaps they can produce content at a faster pace than we're used to. Ep1 came out only two months after the Prologue, when the standard is four months. 
---
The standard:
---
- S2 - 2014: 2 weeks
---
- S3 - 2016: 2 - 3 months
---
- S4 - 2017: 3 - 4 months
---
--- 
---
- Season 5: 2 months (so far)
---
Every year we hear about a new plan, faster but smaller episodes, larger but slower releases, and now again faster  but smaller releases.
---
Always supported by the call to wait for the next episode since it __could__ be much different. It's getting old at some point. They can't expect the players to always live on the hope for the next episode to be better/faster/larger for years.
---
When the prologue was released, people said 'wait for episode 1'. Now episode 1 is here and they say 'wait for episode 2/3/4/5'. Episode 1 was the point where they had to prove their expansion-like content. But it ended up being even shorter than a normal episode.
---
No worries! I have done that several times now with nothing happening, so Anet had me submit screenshots to see if they can pinpoint the bug and get me a solution. Thanks for the help and pinpointing the moment it should spawn in theory! :)
---
You're aware we've heard this "smaller but faster releases" thing before, right?
---
Hey, it took me an entire hour!
---
Fallen are wandering furry convention. I see no other options. Explains svanir shamans at least.
---
The best sort of ingame explaination I found is hungry kodan's quest, where he (very briefly) explains the fate of his convenient 3-man expedition.
---
Jormag needs norm population to stay alive. How is it gonna recruit sons of svanir if the norm don’t breed?
---
Maybe. I'm, not arguing "this is *definitely* fine." I'm just saying "it *could* be fine, we'll have to see how it plays out to judge it fairly."
---
Could be that it's less busy
---
Maybe they should have been 0APs achis idk...  
---
But it's just confusing the way they're now.
---
Catmander is a variation of the commander tag that you get (iirc) in WvW
---
There's a lot of depressing things you can't do anything about in this map. One of the Pact NPC's around the fort is stuck in an endless loop of collecting evidence concerning the attack, with Jormag always telling her to discard it and start again.
---
Are you limited by currency or daily cap in this image?
---
I mean it’s definitely at least made me want to make a Norn. But uhh....ya know. Bag slots
---
Good troll 7/10
---
I read restarting the story segment will fix it.  Haven't tried myself.
---
I think 90 is the max and thats it
---
Fury seems like it makes sense to me. One of the first things he did after waking up was go all angry and kill Glint for her betrayal, and Kralkatorrik's Torment was *super* angry.
---
Very Witcher's style
---
Jormag changed its mind. It doesn't want us anymore.
---
Are you sure that you've lost 4ap? I'm nore sure I did, but I have just completed one of the puzzles again and I didn't regain 1ap from it.
---
Aah, thanks :)
---
Sorry man i dont settle for scraps and i dont care if it's free, im not a beggar. You shouldnt pity the devs, i dont know how much hard work they put into this but it's just not showing. The atmosphere and the map is beautiful as always but that's as far as it goes. This is their most critical year, after announcing no expansion everyone is wandering wtf exactly are these expansion content features they talked about. 
---
So far we're getting even less than normal lw seasons...... If you want people to be positive Anet needs to actually turn this shit around, make a big comeback or something,a big overhaul of the game, an.....an expansion..... send a message that the game is doing fine in a big way.
---
I doubt it. Mouse over the quantity counter next to the Buy button and it'll tell you what you're limited by.
---
I'm pretty sure I was 2974 this morning, now 2970.  I could be mistaken, if no one else has lost AP from them resetting.
---
Haven't bothered repeating a puzzle yet though.
---
Preeeeeetty sure it's her Dolyak telling her that. She knows not to trust Jormag on such matters, and defers to the expert.
---
Ah, my mistake there. Any respectable dragonslayer knows to defer to their dolyak on such matters. I must be off my game, I'll try to sleep it off.
---
There's Fallen Flies, so it's not all shamans who gave in.
---
Thank you for this, I did not feel like doing trial and error on it.
---
I mean, we *can* judge fairly at this point. Because they've already proven incapable.
---
&gt;     S2 - 2014: 2 weeks
---
S2 2-week releases were like minimal content updates. They would each make Whisper in the Dark look like an expansion. the first four months all took place on Drytop, the next two months were Silverwastes, and then they took six months off completely. 
---
&gt;Every year we hear about a new plan, faster but smaller episodes, larger but slower releases, and now again faster but smaller releases.
---
True, but also, they have had a lot of experience at this, of trying different things. Just as you have learned form that to be super cynical, hopefully they have learned from that what they are and are not capable of, and they can better pace themselves. 
---
They promised something different, we should expect something different. 
---
If we were talking "wait until next *season"* then I could understand the skepticism, but I think it's reasonable to be hopeful that they would release a season of unbalanced episodes, with each being "the size it needs to be to do a specific task," but the sum *total* of them adding up to "big enough to be worth it." 
---
&gt;Episode 1 was the point where they had to prove their expansion-like content.
---
I think that's a completely unreasonable standard. It's a season, there's no reason why the first episode should contain all the good stuff. I mean, if a season of television peaks in episode 1, I don't think that would be considered to be a good season. GW2 s4 didn't peak until the later chapters. The Roller Beetle wasn't until episode 3, and the Skyscale until episode 6. I was never so foolish as to expect to get "an expansion's worth" of content in just one episode.
---
&gt; but without the raids specific community that killed that gamemode
---
How naive of you to think strikes won't end up with a similar "community" after a couple of years. It actually might end up being even worse, because rewards are daily, so after a few more strike mission additions you'll start seeing elitist groups popping up wanting to do all strike missions in one go in as short a time as possible. E v e r y   d a y.
---
It all depends on the toxicity level, dps checks, meta build requirements and such.  
---
That's what makes  group content (for me) something to avoid or not.
---
I really enjoyed my hour of gameplay as well.
---
Anet is free to take a step back and contemplate how we got in this mess in the first place. 
---
"Let's make getting proper templates a priority, its a basic QoL feature that most games have from the start and we need to make it right especially since we monetize it so heavily"
---
"We havent had a single new fractal for a year, maybe we should actually make one, some instabilities are completely ruining the enjoyment of fracs let's change them/remove, people loved nightmare fractal and still play it religiously,why not make more like this?"
---
"WvW/PvP are a huge mess and population is at an all time low, let's make it a priority"
---
"Living world is good and all but it can't sustain the game just by itself, how about focus on a new big expansion"
---
This are very reasonable points of concern cause no matter what they release the problems dont go away magically.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The one thing i will give Anet is that their map creation is beautiful, they always managed to impress me with their artistic work but it's just not enough.... they have to try harder.
---
I have been asking the same thing.
---
I find it stupid Anet have not added this to the game already. Holding multiple teleport scrolls is inconvenient when I can use 1 shared slot for the tome like I do with ls3 and 4. no way in hell am I buying shared slot to hold multiple scrolls. 
---
The main reason I go to  Grothmar is the daily strike. Easier and cheaper to drop doing that all together while the teleport scroll pick up dust in a dark and long forgotten place in my bank.
---
My mistake, I heard it was removed not that it moved
---
&gt;Loves Charr
---
&gt;Hates Humans
---
&gt;Catmander
---
Fuck its me
---
Seems like they'd suit Druid well.
---
Copper-Fed
---
Looks shit!
---
Sword is a mobility weapon with an evade.
---
Dagger is a quickness weapon that applies multiple conditions.
---
When they implemented the races, they should've added this. Still, better late than never. ;)
---
I keep regular track of my ap and yeah I lost 4 and regained the 4 back when I did the puzzles again.
---
The tables on the table
---
This. People seem to not follow the press but happy to whinge on Reddit about things that were never slated for release or things that were discussed and are coming. Understanding not everyone follows press but if you’re going to have an opinion, at the very least you should fact check.
---
THANK YOU!!  &lt;3

#"Cleansing bolts Cleansing bolts Cleansing bolts"

And if we don't know how many people play fractals or how many would use templates, this argument could me a small (if loud) percentage of the playerbase is deeply dissatisfied. I'm guessing far fewer people play instanced content in this game except for stories than you're likely willing to believe. Most people won't use templates.
---
That basic feature might only be used by 5% of the population. The templates I have are enough for me personally to use without buying anything and they're okay. Not great but okay. They wouldn't be a deal breaker for me either way.
---
You're laboring under the assumption that the reddit crowd is somehow representative of the in game crowd. That has never been by experience.
---
Give it a matthias sacrifice if no cc mechanic, id love to see that in open world,  and if you dont cc, boneskinner disappears and goes back on timer, ** satan intensifies **
---
&gt; you'd have to ban every single person who Fashionwar'd anyone 
---
To which you've failed to prove they do this when nonemployees are fashionwar'd
---
Again I await you to prove your claims instead of you parrot'n ToS ToS ToS etc etc etc
---
Expansion level content. I.e. content that you'd expect to see in an expansion. At minimum this includes new masteries that change the game on a fundumental level like gliding and mounts, as well as a full set of new elite specs. This are inarguably parts of a new expansion.
---
Alongside those, new raids, legendaries and fractals are an important part that we also did not get to see.
---
Anet said expansion level content and literally nothing they've delivered so far is expansion level. Its barely living world level content because even living world at least had legendaries associated with it.
---
&gt;Then anet goes back to not saying anything, because not saying anything and getting yelled at for not communicating is strictly better than saying something, and getting yelled at for not living up to the player bases' unrealistic expectations (see people expecting anet to release 1 elite spec an episode)
---
God forbid players hold anet accountable to the game we're giving them money to develop.
---
So stop worrying about them. GW2 obviously isn't, if people are worried even this is too much for those players.
---
I just wanted more story. Like, think about it - if you watched a TV show and the episodes were 1 hour in length but they aired once bi-monthly instead of weekly, how frustrating would that be? I've been hyped and waiting for this episode for months and all I got was an hour of story.
---
i just wanna thank everyone for your opinions and civil discourse. the amount of respect shown in these comments was wonderful, and i appreciate everyone who gave their genuine views. thank you all, and have fun!
---
Again, expansion level content isn't a promise.  it's a description.  Promises are actionable items.  Like build templates.  Expansion level content is as vague as hell.   *pats you on the head*  You're cute, kid.
---
Yeah I noticed I just didn’t give a  crap... :)
---
Some people are too used to content that doesn't really punish them for doing that. Let them have at least 24 hours to try out the new difficulty before deciding everything's hopeless.
---
I think that dragon gona die in the end.
---
Here's a preview of the next version of it: https://imgur.com/b8v2yyU
---
I did the story, map and meta achivs [it's 20/20 in this episode] in less than 10 hours. Only left thing to do for me is to farm map currency and make the new weapons.
---
This is true lol.
---
People were hella amazed by LS2 because for the first time ever developers added a NEW map to the game. (Permanently.)
---
In addition, Silverwastes and Dry Top are unique in that they were maps with a central objective, almost like another game mode. They required cooperation, communication, and skilled gameplay in order to succeeed in their meta events. So people were enjoying the maps a lot back then.
---
Of course, with power creep and RIBA, these maps lost some of their initial appeal. But that does not take away from the thrill players once had.
---
Well, I want to enjoy this game while it lasts. I'm not losing anything, not paying real money for gem. 
---
I'm still a bit new to the game
---
In what universe can you insult new players for treating this like a legit opportunity to practice the raid experience without dealing with the difficulty of an actual raid, and not think your attitude is completely toxic?
---
Chinese New Year occurs Jan 25th next year; so we'll likely get LNY beginning Jan 21st (the Tuesday before) or the 14th.
---
That said, LNY is such a tiny ass holiday I doubt they'll delay the release for it.
---
Obviously not. Esp the silverwastes were great but and it's a big but here with a few points. 
---
It were the first new maps since release with many events in them (south sun cove was pretty dead after ls1 took place there) and they where the first map that had somewhat enjoyable farming. Sw and to a smaller extent dry top are still run today. However ALOT more important was expac was beginning to get leaked so people where hyped about that. Now it's the opposite instead of an expac we get this.
---
Kinda hard to compare with so many years in-between, technology has come a long way, maybe not so much with Anet but back then every update was pretty impressive since we didn't know any better.
---
A lot of the (in some ways justified) complaints are from veterans who've played for years. I played this game hardcore for at least the first 2 years after I got it, definitely got my money's worth.
---
In Jhavi's room, under the bed. Kinda like the Lusty Argonian Maid.
---
[removed]
---
Complaints, justified or not, are one thing. But basically every vaguely positive post (and even the ones that aren't) get downvote spammed in new, it's exhausting.
---
They've repeatedly stated that Episode 2 will share maps with Episode 1.
---
In the PAX stream, they also said that Episode 2 will share the same atmosphere and even be the same story plotline, as opposed to how previous episodes have functions.
---
Basically, they cut a S4 episode in half, and released the first half of it in half the time we normally get a full S4 episode. Which is why "Episode 1 Part 1" feels so small - because it's just half of the episode.
---
We're still getting roughly the same amount of content over the same amount of time, but they're splitting that amount in half on both accounts.
---
Was stuck and couldn't progress in The Invitation quest when it asks me to have Riven tier 2, now I can continue
---
Because people aren't rushing the story, its just extremely short. You can finish it in under an hour with a shitty rares build that only autoattacks.
---
People are pretending that you're supposed to finish it by walking everywhere and if you as much dare to run instead of walk its "speedrunning" and its your fault for it lasting 30 minutes.
---
Considering they were openly hiring mobile devs for the past 5 years or so only a fool would take you on that bet.
---
Idk the theme sounds awfully similar to a certain game with a very similar monster &gt;.&gt;
---
ding ding ding ding
---
I think there is strike mission for it but it's bot this week.
---
Counterpoint. You are in a thread discussing the newest story content, spoilers are going to happen and if you don't want anything to be spoiled stay out of discussions about the content that you haven't seen.
---
Anet just wants you to have a close-up of your character's crotch. What's wrong with that?
---
They did release Heart of Thorns and Halloween at the same time after all
---
I had no idea a year and half passed in one day.
---
Are you trapped in an alternate dimension?
---
（╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
---
You know, sometimes I dream about a timeline where GGG or Digital Extremes were the ones to create and publish GW2. Imagine what a game that would be...
---
I love bloodstone fen, and it was very loved back in the day, apparently.
---
there are special kind of ppl,which still dont understand that 2 hours of content is ALL what we are getting for next 3 months. Im not even gona mention that map missing:BOUNTY,GRIFON MASTER/EXPERT,RACE OF ANY KIND,HEARTS,LEGENDARY,INFUSION and WELL....CONTENT. so if you are snowflake and you playing 5 mins every day,good for you,but ppl were expecting SAGA WHICH IS BIGGER THAN SEASON!""!!""!"!" and they got shit all over their face.
---
Ahahaha. I laughed.
---
Yeah.
---
I didn't even notice the icon change, but I did notice that it moved all the way to the right hand side
---
Sword and Shield, the newest Pokémon games.
---
as someone who just recently started playing the game and played through all of the living world story i find this really interesting. in my experience Kourna was definetly the best map of s4 (while Sirens Landing was maybe not the best, but also not the worst of s3)
---
I don't want to believe this but I do.
---
I've yet to play huge part of the story, so I'm gonna ask: is the GW2 story really good? So far nothing looked interesting, only cliches with no twist. Like, it seems VERY generic to me.
---
\- Dragons as villains but also nature forces? Just like Elder Scrolls and Dragon Age;
---
\- A northern frozen power that recruits an army? The presentation looked really like a Game of Thrones thing.
---
\- Little guys with hi-tech stuff? Asura are basically gnomes from Warcraft more focused on eletronics.
---
The list goes on... Nothing so far has impressed me, and even when something could be potentially interesting, the presentation tends to be horrible and make it suck (I still have to surprass the fact that the final battle against Zhaitan is just... You don't even touch him, just use his canons.)
---
I DESERVE an entire expansion worth of content in one episode! FOR FREE! Who the FUCK does anet think they are only giving me a couple hours worth of content???? And dont get me started on the gem store! They actually expect me to pay MY hard earned money for things they worked on? This is a video game not a fucking business, if anet wants money they should go out and get jobs like the rest of us!
---
&gt; it's exhausting.
---
The commuity on this sub as doing just as much damage to the game as Anet is. I try to actively avoid coming to this sub now because its just a cesspool now. Anet might've started it with lack of communication/bad management but you can be damn sure this community will make this boat sink into hell.
---
I like your ideas, but am actually pretty happy that most of the map is already much darker and less saturated than most of the bright and colorful imagery gw2 usually presents.
---
Why not just put the teleport scroll into the inventory of the character doing the Strike?  Is the one in Grothmar really so challenging that you need to have multiple characters on call?
---
It wasn't the first time, Southsun Cove was added before LS1. Everyone just forgets that it exists.
---
Here’s me:
---
Yes-
---
Loves Charr- kinda badass metal-loving cat people (I am not a furry!) 
---
Never played GW1- I don’t know if I’d like it. I get claustrophobic in games where I cannot jump
---
Imagine Crying over Free Content- I don’t like that people complain about getting stuff for free, but in three months if someone has to buy and complains, it’s 100% justified. Basically don’t cry about things that’ll be fixed or improved later on. 
---
Thinks the story is really good- for MMOs, yes (imo gw1 isn’t an mmo)
---
If you don’t like it, just leave- it’s a video game, you don’t have to stay
---
Hates PvP- I hate making other people lose in order to win
---
Maybe:
---
Buys Gems- used to when expansions were still a thing 
---
“Thanks ArenaNet”- thanks for the free content. I also say it sarcastically when I realize that I have gotten gear for my main character/build and with the way things are going, there may not be a reason for me to get ascended gear for any of my other builds
---
Bad at Fashion Wars- this is mostly based on opinion
---
Lives Living World- concept, not execution 
---
Nope:
---
Only plays one build- due to build templates, I only play three per character 
---
Raids are too toxic- said no one ever
---
Downvotes you- I see no reason to
---
Cried when Treahearne died- hated that guy. Still the worst part of leveling new characters
---
Catmander- doesn’t think themselves skilled enough to have tags
---
Pays for Build Templates- just grind a lot for new characters 
---
Thinks fractals are too hard- I find them to be relatively easy compared to dungeons in other games tbh
---
Hates raids, never played them- played them, lives them, hates pugs
---
WvW?- I love wvw since it’s just fun to play (winning doesn’t matter as much because there isn’t a ranked mode)
---
Never played a dungeon- quality solo content
---
Rare and masterwork gear- ascended and exotic gear (depending on what I use the build for)
---
Hates humans- I don’t have a problem with them. I personally don’t play them because if I’m gonna play a fantasy game, I don’t wanna be a human
---
Only presses 1- no, I press enter, spam 1, and then spam the dodge key and die (oh wait, you’re not supposed to do that... huh, am I actually doing something good? Everyone else does that during events)
---
Has all the mount skins- why would I pay $1,000 for something that I’d only use $20 of? 
---
Loves Taimi- didn’t realize how much I disliked her until she left
---
How I’m scoring myself:
---
Yes- 1 pt, Maybe- 0.5 pt, Nope- 0 pts
---
Final score: 8/25!
---
I've seen a couple of Skyscale flight chains for Karma. Doesn't seem to be an achievement added to them though. 
---
I'd really like to see Griffon Adventures making a comeback.
---
Lol victim blaming for stating cold hard facts, that is a new one. I don't blame the door if I walk into it, I blame myself.
---
Good quality, just not nearly enough of anything. Even the map is small (for now). It was abysmally lacking in actual content.
---
They also rushed it and cut a lot of content.. Like the whole nightmare court story and many Sylvari lore which was ignored and that we will probably never get.
---
People really do love to use the words "walking simulator" on literally any game they dislike that involves any degree of walking
---
right, i should look before i sit and you should put the seat down when you're done
---
Yeah, the story overall is really mediocre. Everything is just regurgitated tropes, sometimes only tangentially related to established lore, which then makes the lore more confusing or questionable. You yourself are a voiced character with a specific personality, but there's no development of your character, so you're basically forced to be this flat generic hero, over which you have no control. They don't know how to make character deaths feel important or moving, and there are countless times during the story where it's obvious that they're trying to make you feel a certain emotion.
---
If you care at all about roleplaying or wanting to be an interesting or believable or at least immersive character, you won't like the story, especially from HoT to the present, where you won't be able to skip any of the voiced cutscenes, because the dialogue happens without a cutscene. You'll be forced to watch your character participate.
---
"Whole thing is a low-effort walking simulator"
---
It's a valid criticism with most of GW2's story though. Compare the intricate level design of GW1 to GW2's... easy mode narrative with scripted events and cutscenes in between?
---
Granted, the later story episodes of GW2 are really good. It's just too bad it's not married to gameplay.
---
My issue with the story isn't the length, but the design.
---
Yup. Sometimes they enforce the "Heroic comedy" too far. Sometimes they get it right (like the very beginning of PoF). Sometimes they put it in almost every single answer to every single npc and that can be anticlimatic as hell.
---
My guess is that next episode is gonna do that. Like how many people wanted a new launcher and the Icebrood Saga part of the Hero tab to be blue...and BAM we got both! They probably need more time making something like a menu with new music
---
Really love the vibe they have going on. Still excited about that interview where they said it will be heading into cosmic horror territory.
---
Pyre Fierceshot would like to have a word.
---
Most of the people who "give a shit" that are getting downvoted constantly are the ones who refuse to admit *any* mistakes ANet makes, so yes. I would say he is wrong.
---
There are tons of people who give a shit about this game and post constantly, and aren't getting downvoted. They also don't only post negativity! They just aren't willingly blinding themselves to the game's faults, and aren't riding ANet's dick at every opportunity.
---
I dont want an expansion worth of content... i literally just want a regular LIVING WORLD amount of content, which we didn't even get.
---
Old living world episodes came with raids, fractals, legendaries, and sometimes new mounts... And even if you ignore all those things, the actual map and STORY itself still used to be much bigger/longer.
---
It's sad when the fucking prologue episode ended up being bigger than the actual episode itself. It baffles me that people would try to justify that.
---
It was objectively good, it just didn't have volume or the specific kind of content many people wanted.
---
For people who specifically want living world story, it was good. If you want raids or fractals or elite specs, then you're looking for something else entirely, and you can't judge the quality of the content based on the fact that it isn't the specific content that you wanted.
---
Yeah that is what I said. I don't walk into a thorn bush and then get angry at being pricked. It is seriously super simple and easy to avoid any and all spoilers, and that starts with knowing where to go and not to go online. Sucks if someone doesn't know that, they will learn the same way everyone else has because most people aren't going to not talk about something that is new, especially in a section of a website dedicated to that very thing.
---
The lack of development saddens me, since at the start of the game, we are given options that change the personal story partialy, and there's even an "personality system" that allows you to lvl up your bravery, charm and dignity. But it never made a difference in any circunstance that I'm aware from. 
---
Just feels like beta remains of a scrapped feature that could be awesome.
---
They also mentions mounts and elite specs in those interviews! We can remain hopeful, no one in their right mind can think that cooking can encompass all the worth of expansions features.
---
I got the better part of both o.O
---
ok, well this thread is not labeled as containing spoilers, so why should i just assume it contains spoilers.
---
it only takes a few key strokes to spoiler tag something &gt;!!&lt;
---
why is that harder than attacking me?
---
Imagine unironically typing this reply.
---
It blocks the content skippers.
---
Like the game.
---
It's an objective downgrade to past living world updates in every way imaginable though.
---
Past Living World episodes were longer, came with bigger maps, better metas, had raids/fractals included, had legendaries, and 3 of them even had new mounts... 
---
What did this episode have? A tiny map with a short story and an easy strike mission. Wow, much content.
---
It was NEVER an expansion.
---
I'm not attacking you, we are having a discussion. If you feel you are being attacked that is on you. I don't know you, nor care about you enough to warrant an attack on you.
---
Yes I'm sure people wanting the most effective option for a specific form of content is due to a generation that 'cannot enjoy anything for themselves and feel the need to have others tell them how to feel about absolutely everything' 
---
yes. its definitely that.
---
???????????????????????????????????????????
---
\&gt;They are the kings of overselling features.

ok, well would you like to share your thoughts in regards to *the episode* then

The main thing that will affect CPU longevity is overclocking/overheating.

Lol.. people complain when there's spoilers.. and when people talk about anything that isn't spoilers... they get rekt'd
---
&gt;is generous....I feel like it took me 45 mins at the most.
---
Agree... achievements are for OCD's... not me. I could give a rip less.
---
you want dungeons back, theyre still there so go run them.
---
it was new technology at that point in time. they released it sooner into season 4 because they had estaBlished a precedent
---
Why, what happened in the GoT finale?
---
It’s weird, I remember being really excited for the final season...  And I remember watching the first two episodes...  But then, nothing?  Just a big black void in my memory.
---
Pretty much everyone discussing the actual content present and not just whining about what wasn't included in the patch has said that they loved it. I quite enjoyed it.
---
As for the missions... dude, where have you been? That's how its been since vanilla GW2.
---
Thread removed: Spoiler(s) are not allowed in titles, feel free to re-post this without the spoiler in the title.

This patch not simplifies what is actually changed with the roller beetle stamina bar.
---
Previously the roller beetle had it's own stamina, while all the other mounts shared a stamina bar. The difference between these bars, is that when the bar is inactive (unmounted, or using the stamina bar for other mounts). these bars did different things. The roller beetle bar slowly lost stamina when it was inactive, but it never re-set to 0 when mounting the roller beetle. The standard mount endurance bar slowly regenerated. Also the roller beetle bar started at 0% after map load, while the normal mount bar starts at 100%.
---
This update removes the roller beetle stamina bar and makes it use the same bar as all of the other mounts. Therefore the roller beetle follows the normal mount rules for filling it's stamina bar.
---
Interestingly, with the normal mount stamina bar, the bunny, I mean springer, the shared mount bar fills much faster when the springer is active.
---
Normally for all other mounts accelerating the bar regeneration by switching to springer doesn't justify the cost of un-mounting an re mounting repeatedly. With the roller beetle now on the shared stamina, and simply with how much more effective the beetle is after boosting than before boosting. If you ever find your stamina depleted on a stopped beetle, or you are about to mount the beetle and know the common bar is depleted, the bunny may be an effective way to fill the stamina bar before (re-)mounting on the beetle, giving you must faster access to the beetle's boost than normal in those situations.
---
Yea I mean they could have just made it darker and added fog at specific places. It fails the claustrophobic feeling it seems to be aiming for.
---
Oh wow - I think I've heard it for literally every major release involving walking (except, hilariously, Breath of the Wild), especially those in an open world, and x10 for any game that isn't universally praised

I'm thinking it could completely go either way. Way too many characters pointing out how weak Bangar was makes me think that Jormag singled him out using his pride as emotional blackmail. I'm thinking that at least a few of his more loyal followers will abandon him near the final fight when they realize that Bangar was manipulated as well. It is gonna be interesting whatever direction they take.
---
if you subtract 1 from each of the numbers, it becomes a sequence of binary numbers counting up in numerical order
---
Except every living story before this had more engaging missions?
---
Also, clearly not *everyone* discussing it, because *I* personally think the content presented in this Living Story chapter was *really fucking short and mediocre*.
---
Just because you don't read the comments actually discussing the content, doesn't mean that *everyone* discussing it "said they loved it."
---
Oof. Get rekt
---
New features, new places, variety of content - HoT 2.0. I actually thought they were on a good path with ls4 ep 5 and 6, but sadly it's not the case anymore. 
---
Everything after HoT was just a hot mess of fanservice and microtransactions with a few accidentally great releases.
---
at this point community spoken about templates, if you are going 180 now you are trolling or bating and I wont fell for that
---
Check windows setting for the 'throttle' setting.  Overheating will cause stutters. Last time I had stutters my heat sink grease had dried up.
---
I play with 6-year-old system, i3-3770 for the last 6+ years with stock cooler and fans.
---
OK GW2oomer
---
This
---
There was so much detail in the map with the shards of ice everywhere and shit. Its beautiful, who knows how long that took to make. Underappreciated imo
---
Ls4 also had a few mounts as well as pretty good story instances. When you look at PoF maps they are just a bigger version of LS maps. Dragonfall is the best map in the game by far.
---
The rest I agree with.
---
i might just start playing again because of this change alone
---
Honestly if we're at that point in the rage cycle, things should be calm pretty soon. Then moist if the chaff will have cleared away.
---
Exactly! haha
---
I, for example, LOVE Zelda lore. It's very cliche in many levels, but the way they work and present it makes all the difference.
---
Except Majora's Mask. That's an original story and a masterpiece in every single aspect.
---
&gt;I DESERVE an entire expansion worth of content in one episode! FOR FREE! 
---
1) This stuff got really old. GW2 is not a charity and not a "free game". Anet chose this model because F2P games bring the most revenue on the modern market, not out of kindness of their hearts. 
---
2) I'd gladly pay for a decent expansion, or for a subscription, provided there was enough content to play. 
---
3) You think you are making other people's statements sound stupid. In reality, you just sound stupid.
---
It picks up a bit in season 3 and into PoF, but then quickly becomes very cliche and has nothing terribly unique about it. If you want a good story, go play FF14.
---
It was great but too goddamn short.
---
"Penor Giganticus". Nice.
---
One it wasn't there 250 years ago Jora's homestead was. Two its 250 years and has been ravaged and attacked by an elder dragon. Three not all architecture is the same I don't get this comment "why doesn't this look like other Norn architecture". Human architecture isn't always the same.
---
I really like it.
---
Not to butt in, but you were the first to say the content was objectively good. The other fellow responded to that, saying that nothing can be objectively good.
---
Burden of proof is on you.
---
Did you even play through the missions? The main missions you could fail and need to start all over again? Have fun walking through Thunderhead Keep or the Mursaat on the Ring of Fire.
---
Besides, Prophecies is the very first Guild Wars game released by Ane, try to compare later campaigns like Nightfall to PoF.
---
Yeah... not a big fan of the masteries either. It takes a long while to hit the require stack amount (30, not 20 like you indicated in your post), but not only that, the stacks degrade over time as well. When you finally reach 30, you get some pretty "meh" bonuses; the only decent bonus you get is the 1.5 sec CD reduction every time you pick an orb up.
---
In addition, the mastery hover tooltip doesn't seem to accurately reflect the in-game abilities. Each special action is supposed to give you a boon attributed with it, but I have never received a boon when using said special action. The qualities of the special action also seem to be inaccurate because the mastery claims the range of them are 1200, but I cant seem to hit anything beyond maybe 800.
---
sooo you are done with *new* map?
---
&gt; and continues to do so pretty significantly each season.
---
Eh it did until S4. It's rebounded since.
---
My fav is twilight princess, Midna is pretty much the only character with actual development in the whole franchise. 
---
I'd say Zelda games aren't that great story wise if you only consider the writing by itself but they really make up with their atmosphere and presentation has you say (that's also why the Souls series is so great) and Majora was amongst the most atmospheric.
---
For Twilight princess, I think part of it is also that I just love huge epic environments (when they are well done, I dislike bethesda games, they make big world without any personality) and it's pretty much the game that felt like it had the biggest scope, not in actual content, it's just that the environment assets were so (literally) big really giving it a grand atmosphere.
---
I haven't played this update, but have some commentary on this meme template.
---
I find it ironic. 
---
There's one loudmouth bird saying something that the calm bird doesn't agree with, typically a negative sentiment (as in this example).
---
The response is this meme which strawmans the arguments and tone (typically cherrypicking outliers to represent all who hold the view).
---
What you get is a "toxic" (I hate this word) post complaining about negativity.
---
I'll leave you guys to it.
---
IMO
---
1. Copper fed salvage o matic
---
2. Perm.  Harvesting tools
---
3. Shared inventory slots for the items above, so they are available on all characters.  Additional shared slots for teleport scrolls/tomes are great too.
---
4. Material storage expander 
---
5. Additional bank tabs
---
I knew I wasnt stupid and the logo changed ! (didnt read patch note  yet)
---
whoud be cool,if he just spawned every 15 mins and killed someone on map :DDD
---
The meme war has begun! *eats popcorn* on a serious note, I did enjoy this update but not as much as grothmar valley. That prologue was perfect for me and i was hoping every episode was like that.
---
I laughed, but this doesn't really help lol
---
I saw something today that kind of implied that map areas would "expand" with further releases, so it's entirely possible this isn't a valid gripe (though I'd still kind of like at least two for the size of the map). And yeah lol, I'm actually motivated to get the roller beetle now, since there are some ice shards you can't farm without one.
---
Good to know about the bonfires, thanks!
---
&gt; but you do know the Icebrood maps are getting bigger with later episodes right?  
---
But if they continue making the make bigger by increments comparable to this episodes map size (as in doubling it next episode), that's still way less content per patch compared to last season... Where we were getting massive maps **per** patch.
---
Essentially, even after doubling this maps size, it would still only be comparable to 1 of the last seasons maps... Meaning less content per patch
---
are you acting like Guild Wars 2 doesn’t have more problems that actualy good things??? cuz that’s were the negativity comes from, look at other games that have only positive things to talk about cuz the game is REALY good, look at ESO or FFXIV, they have issues but that is overshadow by the quality of the game.
---
Not a full set, no, but even one or two adds would have been nice. Especially if Chelsea Mills designed them, she does phenomenal looking weapons.
---
I mean, I like how they improved on forest contrary to the base game. bitterfrost frontier, grothmar valley and now this map are quite nice. My problem? They are to small. Only a little space somewhere on the map and thats it. Grothmar valley is much better in that regard than the other two tho.
---
Stop moving!!! And oooh that’s a cool detail I wonder what it means
---
Yes, because what we need is more hearts and bounties, Im sure you're still spamming that shit on every previous map so that really adds so much value to the map!  
---
Infusions are just a tiny % drop from repeating same meta, how's that even an example of "moar content" you absolute animal? 
---
Complaining about no new legendary just so you can check out a skin and say "ermergewd not even worth crafting, trash skin" also wouldnt add much value. Also if you don't have all of the previous leggies, go craft those, you don't need to run in a new map to do it. And if you DO have every other legendary in the game then you might be calling "snowfake" wrong people, get up from your pc once in a while, you fucking baby.
---
So I wanna get one of these but wouldnt I want the silver fed for the 25% chance to get globs of ectoplasm?
---
If I have the lore correct Kralk was already pissed off before he fell back to sleep with Glint. Also because he had the power of prophecy he likely saw Glint and Destinys Edge getting ready to kill him so he had to kill her.
---
Guild Wars 2 is a fantastic game and I still love logging in and playing it. Has great voice acting and environments plus I think the gameplay is really fun. Don’t let the sub bring you down, focus on the game and players in game :)
---
&gt; The community on this sub is doing just as much damage to the game as Anet is, if not more.
---
I think the small group of entitled whiners that have taken over this sub are doing it on purpose, that's what they want.  They have an ax to grind for whatever reason and are trying to sink it.  Most people, even those that criticize the game because they care about the game, have left this sub or come here less often because of the shit show this place has become.  I certainly don't come to this sub like before and actually use the official forums now, something I never thought I'd do lol.  And even though they heavily moderate there I think it's currently the best place to have a rational discussion about the game whether positive or negative (and I've got my gripes), especially compared to here. As time goes on and more people stop coming here, the echo chamber will just get louder and louder.  It's already happening.
---
Oh yeah, instant market bump. Gotta whale out those ingredients lol
---
I have this theory that the reason the weapons are legendary is we bend space, time, and gravity to shove entire forests and mithril mines into a single blade and we're actually just doing bludgeoning damage with how heavy the damn thing is.
---
They're using the Adventurer's Scarf, Triumphant Pauldrons and the rest is Armageddon Armor. Backpiece is Prize of the Boneskinner, weapon is Godskull Slayer GS.
---
\*Xi. Xi lies. 
---
It's a Dragon, get that whole "it's They" stuff away from here.
---
The story is good enough for world building purposes. As an epic or as a movie script the story isn’t that great but anet’s real strength is building an immersive world and tyria has that in spades.
---
But we saw Kralkatorrik was rational as well before he ate too much magic. They also tried to cleanse him but failed, I guess that's why he had more sense than Zhaitan and Mordremoth.
---
It'll probably be a 3000-gem purchase.  :-(
---
It’s pretty dry to begin, but once you get to Heavensward the story takes a noticeable upturn, and Shadowbringers is one of the best, if not the best story of the year.
---
The new launcher is an expansion level feature
---
I find that if I break the steps for legendary weapons down into small goals (Bill Murray would call them baby steps).

Starting on my first legendary was daunting, but that had more to do with not being familiar with the process. That first one snowballed into getting all legendary land weapons for my guardian, and now I 15 L weapons and additionally have sold some generation 1 weapons that did not aesthetically appeal to me to earn some gold.  *It has become content that I enjoy doing when there are content droughts* and getting burned out on meta trains and daily fractals.   And some say Fashion Wars is the true end game.
---
Yes. I wish I could do permafrost or other ice like colors.

GW2 is excellent at being the kind of game it was always good at: an open world game with a gameplay loop that transitions from solo to ad hoc group play seamlessly. If that's the experience you're looking for, GW2 is the best on they market and has consistently put out content that supports it.
---
If you're looking for more difficult organized group content, GW2 has problems. They're basically the same problems it has always had: the content they release is either too easy, not rewarding enough, too infrequent, or some combination thereof.
---
It's entirely possible for one person to be satisfied with GW2 for over a thousand hours while another person is bored and frustrated after a hundred. It all depends on what the individual is looking for.
---
I missed all of my sides in the "downvote you" kkkkkkjj
---
Everyone can see the reason for the change though, it's not to give us content sooner but to have more releases and have people engage with the gemstore more often.
---
A lot of people use the mystic salvage kits (same 25%, most people have mystic stones on hand, don't have to use gems to make these) instead of the silver fed.  Also, the silver fed is great for rare loots/getting ectos, but you don't get ectos from common and uncommon gear, so it's only a more expensive option (60 c versus 3 c on a per use basis, which adds up)  for salvaging those.  And more of the gear that we get is common/uncommon.  
---
Don't get me wrong, Silver fed is a good purchase, but the copper fed is a better one imo.  Silver fed would probably be #6 on my recommended list.
---
The fact that you're saying it in past tense sounds like you're already done with the update, which only adds to the problem. You should be able to still say a couple weeks or months from now that you like it, not liked it. It literally just released after all.
---
In the base game, it is. Or rather, the structure of the *quests* that tell the story is bland, which is still a valid reason to consider the story bland, but the story itself would be improved just by reducing the tedium in the base game.
---
The expansion stories are miles better than any other MMO story, almost universally agreed. Even Stormblood, which is a bit weak by comparison to Heavensward and Shadowbringers, is still above and beyond the competition.
---
But it's a FF game, so that shouldn't be surprising.
---
Being that it's a Vigil outpost now, the construction needs to consider the comfort of other races. Norn (and probably charr) would be able to handle the far too large norn buildings but humans, sylvari, and asura would get way too cold. Tents would not provide much of a defense or foothold in an area where they expect attacks. And any building would need to be designed in such a way that it can be repaired swiftly.
---
The stilts are fairly common in places where snow drifts can partially or fully submerge a building in hours. They can also help during the seasonal melt (assuming it's far enough south) as it keeps the building from sinking into mud. I think it also keeps the building warmer as it's not sitting on the cold ground.
---
The squareness is utilitarian and the rounded roof is stronger than a flat one would be while also reducing the snow build up. It's a military outpost, not a civilian town. Svanir are more likely to keep norn aesthetic and design because they are only norn (and fanatically so) thus don't have to consider other races. They also don't need to worry about an attack from Jormag and the Vigil aren't able to do any large-scale attacks in the area, thus defense is not the biggest priority to the Svanir.
---
There is norn desgn in that building, but it's the design of prioritizing function over form as fits a military outpost in/near enemy territory.
---
Yes rational but he was also fighting his torment not to mention he brands everything he flies across.
---
Yeah I saw this one too.
---
That's... not how burden of proof works. Innocent-until-proven-guilty, not guilty-until-proven-innocent.
---
Person 1: [statement]
---
Person 2: You're wrong.
---
It is now Person 2's responsibility to prove how Person 1 is wrong.
---
If it didn't work this way, society would immediately collapse in on itself.
---
Hmm, I wonder why players are so disgruntled. It must be that the community is just a bunch of assholes! Can't be that the game has gone to shit and even the most asked for feature arguably in the history of the game was implemented poorly and way overly monetized. Nah, it's the community. This community, that has been notoriously understanding and defensive when it comes to Anet, they're just a bunch of assholes who want to be angry for no reason.
---
Gw2 is a great game for newcomers. It's the long time vets who are looking for reasons to continue logging in daily that are displeased with the way the game is going. The idea that the playerbase should stop voicing their very real and very justified concerns with the game because it might turn off new players is ridiculous.
---
You've expressed a remarkable number of opinions that I didn't.
---
You da real MVP.
---
You aren't doing any favors in terms of representing the disgruntled portion of the player base dude...
---
You can believe that if you want. That doesn't make it true. The rent can easily be paid by casuals, because there are more of them. They're not looking for challenging content to earn rewards and some were probably trained by face book games and cell phone games to spend money on the game.  I can't prove it, but I'm sure this game can survive without a hardcore contingent.
---
I'm equally certain, but again can't prove, that this game couldn't survive with the casual population.
---
Wasn't that portal in VB an entrance to the raids/Forsaken Thicket and not Bloodstone Fen?
---
The writing is still pretty bad though tbh. At least dialogue-wise. The concepts they're trying to explore are interesting but the execution feels similar to one of those bad superhero shows. 
---
I've noticed a lot of people tend to be more lenient with storytelling in video games fsr. But if this game's dialogue was in some form of show or movie people would laugh at it and call it hot garbage.
---
You're not wrong, honestly. It used to be that if you had anything negative to say about gw2, you would get swarmed in not only downvotes, but that other thing on reddit where when you say something unpopular, eight people have to respond with different variations of "wow I guess you're an idiot then, now I know". The worm has turned and it didn't happen for no reason at all. That's the main point to hammer home here. People didn't just randomly turn on Anet. It was well earned, and it wasn't just one thing. Build templates were the straw that broke the camel's back.
---
Wpuld you mind elaborating? I'm not sure how much detail someone would see simply zooming through it. Unless it's sarcasm of course XD
---
You're right I responded to the wrong person, my bad.
---
My dumb butt bought the glider a while back, thinking it could be dyed. The flames thankfully matched the character I was using it on (at the time) anyway, but if I could dye it other colors I would probably use it more often
---
It's not just the same minipet, its the exact same giveaway bundle
---
I think Bubbles was also featured in the season cinematic (with the ships and dead krait)
---
You see every single bit of detail as you slam into it at mach 4 half a second after accelerating.
---
It's still one of my favorite maps. I don't typically have much reason to be there, but it was super fun to navigate.
---
This picture has been edited appropriately.
---
&gt; I think most raiders dont realize that their community is what kills Raiding.
---
God this is just so utterly ridiculous.
---
Got mine. Thanks!
---
Where did his torment come from since it has been thousands of years and all the magic he had eaten should be gone.
---
Nah it was you for being mean!
---
There are about 6 users, you will notice them right away, that are spamming negative comments about the game to justify their narrative in all topics. I am starting to believe that they are the same person given how much of a gramophone they are repeating themselves to exhaustion. Even their phrase structure are similar. I am really avoiding this place because of the echo chamber they are creating in here. There are lots of things to criticize, but there are people who are enjoying themselves. Don't take this from them.
---
lol do you think if you say that bullshit will actualy become truth? how delusional can you be? lool ofc white knights of anet, what do I expect from an delusional lier like you, “permanent content drought” really the most pathetic lie I heard
---
Any competitive environment where teamwork is required will have some people acting like assholes trying to get everyone to carry their weight. It's just the way it goes. If you don't want anyone to ever be mean to you, either be prepared and carry your weight, or play a less challenging game mode.
---
&gt; Can you think of a reason why they decided not to change the character screen and music to fit the Icebrood Saga? Should we maybe wait for the peak of the Season?
---
Honestly this is not a significant concern for me. I would not be remotely bothered if we still had the original white and red launch screen with the giant "2." I care about what *content* this update brings, and to me, from a storytelling perspective, I can see good reasons why they might build up to larger and larger episodes over the season, or release new features when it would make sense to do so in the plot, rather than dumping them all in at once. Done right, I could see that as an *advantage* to a release pattern like this verses an expansion.
---
Well it's organized team content that requires each member to carry their weight to be able to complete the content. What do you expect? People to not hold you to any sort of standard, despite the fact that they are reliant on you carrying your own weight for them to be able to complete?
---
This sub: The boat is sinking see there are a few leaks 
---
Also this sub: *drills holes in the boat* look at all the water coming in god damn what a shitty boat
---
&gt; Asura solve everything through deus ex magic. Taimi as a main NPC gets the bulk of this for the story.
---
Biggest issue IMO. Its not our story. Its Taimi's story and we are just one of her servants fetching stuff and doing field research.
---
The moment Taimi appears or speaks I just turn my sound off, turn my own music on and rush through the story until I get to tag along with Canach or Rytlock, and then we still get called on our phone (another huge mistake TBH) by Taimi. 
---
Taimi ruins the story for me and I want her to die. Its a real shame Joko had to toy around first instead of turning her into scarab food.
---
That guy is speaking as if every challenging team content in any game has inevitably died off... that's not the case at all. It died off in gw2 because Anet stopped caring. As you said, if there were so many people looking to play casually in challenging content, they wouldn't have to spill over into hardcore groups with the expectation of not having to pull their weight. The reality is, when they try to group up they fail too often for people to find it fun and want to come back, then they find easier content. There's nothing wrong with that.
---
The Vigil's camps throughout Tyria have been historically as shabby and adhoc as the Svanir camps in Bjora Marches, even in Shiverpeak Territory. And as far as I know Vigil has been multi-racial, so all those tents and organic layouts can tend to the comforts of other races just fine, even in snowy areas. 
---
I don't buy that military outposts near Dragons have to be square and boring at all in Tyria - see almost every military outpost in the game before this.  From Fort Trinity in core Tyria, to Pact Command at Dragonfall.
---
I get that there is norn design on the square buildings, and the textures are fine, it's the bones of gw2 architecture are missing. I walked into that building in the first story instance and I didn't feel like I was in GW2. I could've been in any MMO at that point.
---
Thanks! Btw 300 keys left when I got mine
---
Anet's cutscene team continue to soundly deliver on what they're asked to.
---
But I'm afraid that all this fantastic work may end up going the exact same way as Palawa Joko's monologue - another cutscene where they really pushed the game engine to its limits in rendering his creepy movement, and where he's written as making a frankly frightening amount of sense... only to be blown off and the points he raises never brought up again.
---
To each their own, but I felt like S4 was an improvement over S3, which felt *very* gimmicky and disjointed to me. Probably a step backward after PoF, but I don't know how fair it is to compare expansions to LW seasons.
---
Clearing your cache helps a lot too.  I do this whenever I think about it really.
---
More info: https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/231273908-Troubleshooting-Trading-Post-Errors
---
This happens all the time. Anet does something that effectively "flushes the cache" and the TP gets faster and eventually slows down again until they have to flush it again. 
---
Doubt they did anything new
---
Never said we need less of everything. What I said is your examples of "moar content" were terrible and there's absolutely no reason to add "more hearts, bounties, extra leggies and an infusion!!!11" and pretend that would make an episode so much better for you, because it wouldn't. I told you why and you didn't bother addressing any of that, so I guess you agree with what I said?  
---
I asked you if you crafted all previous legendaries, no answer here either, so I assume you didn't. So you still do have content to farm through, go do that and stop pretending that A NEW LEGGY or a NEW 0,00001% drop chance item would be a fresh different content from what you aleady have in the game and didn't do anyways.
---
&gt; They realized people will leave raids sooner or later so they tried to find some content that is more accessible to everyone
---
People didn't "leave" raids, Anet abandoned them.
---
Ah yes, that's why there's a substantial gemstore update with every seasonal release.
---
That depends. Do those players want GW2 to support raids and fractals as major game content? Then yes, this is not the game for them, never has been and never will be. Do those players want GW2 to continue supporting open world PvE as the central game format? Then those players are happy, because they're the intended audience and getting exactly what they want.
---
I'm pretty sure one of the spirits I saw was Almorra when I encountered this. It makes me wonder if the threat that Jormag is talking about might be related to the Mists, since the damage Kralkatorrik did to it during season 4 was probably pretty catastrophic for reality, and I did wonder if that's why we're encountering these Fallen and Aberrant entities now.
---
Is there even a portal scroll or home instance node? didn’t see anything at the trade in the keep.
---
A bit meta gamey, but if you read Edge of Destiny you know a lot about Jormag.
---
because typing down mechanics before each boss every week for raids that are 4 years old is so much fun. Or you could do something yourself like watching a video but that would be on your end. blaming others is much easier
---
Don't even try to muzzle criticism
---
It has definitely not gotten faster by any noticeable amount before. It's only gotten progressively slower since 2012, and now it's about as fast as it was in 2013-2014.
---
Unfortunately, seeing that the devs are trying to please the vast majority by pushing characters that they deem cute or quirky, and considering that merch with said cute characters sells well, it was easy to predict they'd go back on killing Aurene, just like they chickened out with Taimi. It's easier (and lazier) to capitalize on cute/quirky characters rather than writing decent characters that the players can become invested in, and they've constantly proven that their writing is some of the laziest out there.
---
You're not wrong, but you assume the people leading actually know what they're doing.
---
In my experience, most of them don't know much beyond their one specific role.
---
Thanks, mate. No Quiznos in Australia. My wife and I both got one.
---
Side note: I'm currently playing and enjoying FF14, but...
---
&gt; It’s pretty dry to begin, but once you get to Heavensward the story takes a noticeable upturn
---
"*It's a slog for ~150 to 200 hours of cookie-cutter gameplay and cutscenes that just won't end, but after that it gets better*" is not a compelling selling point.
---
I doubt that it's because these people doing the downvoting have alts and are lurking the subreddit, looking for things to downvote to oblivion (not to inaccurately imply that you're implying that). I mean, sure, maaaaybe there's a person or two doing that, but what's more likely to be the case is that the displeasure with the release is a commonly held opinion. Is that not a possibility? That said, I don't think that content should be voted upon based on opinion, so it's unfortunate that it's getting heavily downvoted.
---
Now we know why they moved the black lion icon. Who's have thunk it?
---
According to GW2Efficiency statistics, noone has Lighting the XXXX achievements done so this bug concerns everyone.
---
&gt; Even worse, they admitted that they didn't even want to do another expac and instead replace it with THIS.
---
Source?
---
Matter of opinion. There's a lot I really like about the Prologue. I'm a big fan of mini games and races, so that zone was great. By storywise, particularly for a guy who does story on more than one character, that story was a disaster.  Sure it was great, the first time. But it was a long long slog to get all the characters I'd normally get through through it.   
---
The achievements were too many for the meta, too grindy, particularly for that rewards. Not really worth it, even though I did it.  Hitting 300 targets at a shooting range, not hard, just annoying to wait for that event so many times. Same with so many other achievements. Let's kill some rabid fans at a concert, only need 500 of them.  And I did them, because I do achievements, but it was overtuned for a more casual player. It's not really what I want to spend my time doing.
---
For me, this zone is better.  I love the tone. I like the story. And I like how quickly I can actually it.  I felt like the other story had a lot of filler, and I didn't really love all the running around, talking to cubs, opening boxes. Just not fun.   
---
So it's just a matter of opinion. Grothmar had great mini games, by story wise, it drags to repeat. Mapwise, this one is faster to repeat, which is good for me, since it's one of the ways I get some black lion keys.
---
Thanks. There’s a lot of people in this thread trying to convince me that the implementation is the same but it’s the assets cause the issue. Clearly it’s nothing to do with the assets and everything to do with the implementation of the UI. I don’t expect the average user to know anything about responsive design, but there’s a lot of people in here blinding assuming I’m wrong because my comments are critical of ArenaNet lol. 
---
To readers of this comment chain that don’t know much about coding, the Hero Panel code being used for the character select screen is called code reuse and is encouraged. Why reinvent the wheel right? This doesn’t stop ArenaNet from fixing the aspect ratio in the character select screen though. ArenaNet can extend the object and have it handle the rendering correctly, or edit the original object so that it can handle all aspect ratios. This would have the benefit of improving the functionality of the Hero Panel too if implemented well. 
---
“extend” in this context means creating something from a blueprint and changing the new blueprint. Think about “Labradoodle” being an extension of “Labrador”.
---
**Black Lion Dye Channel Unlocker (2 weeks)**
---
Unlock a dye channel for a random skin in your wardrobe! This item will unlock one channel for one of the weapon skins, armor skins, outfits, gliders and mount skins unlocked in your account.
---
Note that skins with four channels unlocked won't be affected. The unlocker's effect lasts for two weeks, after which the added dye channel is reverted.
---
If you are a new player of course you won't see the short comings of the game because you have to get through like 6 years of backlog content. Those of us who are up to date have basically little reason to log in for more than a day every 4 months. That's generally not really a good place for an MMO to be in.
---
mind if i ask if these stuff is worth it? am kinda still trying to find out every stuff of the game, and ive not payd attention to home Node (since i never visited my home)
---
it would be nice if you actually tell the name if the demon
---
Because Guild Wars have a small team of devs who actually cares about the game, whilst Guild Wars 2 have a huge team of developers who don’t care. Easy as that.
---
Loved your post thank you it makes sense cool detail
---
Great meta? Really? You're going with great?
---
Underapreciayef, oh yes !
---
First map where i just don't want to check on the web where are the achievements or how to do them. Everything is an invitation to wander. 
---
I really like the mirror puzzles or the forest part of the map.
---
And yes maybe the meta is kind of boring... But I bet the map is a small part of a bigger one. Just like they told us. So, maybe the meta is not complete yet. And with episode 2 we'll have something huge. Maybe.
---
I only hated Dry Top because you needed crystals to navigate it. Thank the Five we have mounts now...
---
My only complaint.  Literally my only complain is the boneskinner is way too easy for the buildup in the trailers and its Champion status.  There's just way too much focus on it in the story and the leadup to release for it to be as easy as it is.  It has a 10 minute timer and we killed it in 1 minute without an LFG meta going on.
---
&gt; Just gonna take some points out of there, smallest map, they announced maps would gonna be similar to season 2, episode 2 expanding on 1, so compare them with dry top which to my knowledge got released in 3 parts. Is it then small? it's only roughly 2/3 of most s3/4 maps.
---
They said that these maps would be expansion worthy because they would be replacing the actual expansion. This ridiciulously tiny map being all we get for 4 months is not even remotely close to being expansion worthy.
---
&gt;the least achievements? you checked gw2effi? compared to season 4 there are in season 4 2 maps that have more ap, 1 similar and 3 way less ap, amount of achievements is slightly lower here. Compare it with Season 3 and all 6 maps gave less AP and only 1 had more achievements. So deffo not the least achievements.
---
AP isn't actually achivements though. A map with 50 achivements that give 1AP each (which they usually do) has less achivements than a map with 10 that give 10 each.
---
&gt;Shortest story, it has same pattern as previous content with 3 instances and some in between stuff, think anet did right on them without making the instances stretched out in a way it becomes boring, only agree on the second instance mayby being a bit to less, for the rest, mayby slightly shorter but better that then making them longer with unbeneficial stuff.
---
Uh okay, except follow the same pattern doesn't actually change the fact that the story is still painfuly short.
---
Sure, the lore was interesting, but the episode wasn't particularly interesting beyond that. It was the shortest LW episode to date, it has the smallest LW map to date (I think), the story had very little combat (which is GW2's claim to fame to an extent), the meta is possibly the most mindnumbing meta in the entire game, etc. Don't get me wrong. For the most part, I enjoyed the release. But I don't currently enjoy it. I've already completed it (except the super grindy achievements), and there's no particularly compelling reason for me to revisit it. Like I said, I enjoyed it, but it leaves a desire for something more or better.
---
I liked it more than a lot of the other LW metas. It was better than thunder head keep, or the island ones (I forget the map name), or jahai bluffs. Idk I just dug it.
---
*shrugs*  à plus tard.
---
It's a [Wendigo](https://www.google.com/search?q=wendigo&amp;client=firefox-b-d&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjI3rLb3_rlAhWPzIUKHZngCFwQ_AUoAXoECBEQAw&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=954#imgrc=cijUFg_mY2rLsM:), it's even datamined as wendigo
---
" perhaps instead it's a nice touch of subtle foreshadowing that will become much more impactful as the story progresses "  
---
Sorry to break it to you, but the writing team don't know what subtle or nuance means.
---
It's more like, it's unreasonable to expect most people to play the same game for 7 years. People change; I certainly like different things than the me of 7 years ago. It's impossible for them to cater to all veteran players, as they all change to want different things. So some people will obviously no longer enjoy it, and should move on when they realise the game is not heading in the direction they want.
---
The prologue was the one before this one, which was a bigger update (bigger map, longer story, more events etc) than this episode 1 of the saga. People expected it to be bigger than the prologue and were dissappointed when that didn't turn out to be the case.
---
I had the same problem. Restarting the client fixed it for me. The new update notes also mention a fix for it.
---
Whole of Reddit is like that, not only this sub.
---
&gt;WvW Alliances got delayed by another 3 months so that the team could finish this
---
Funny way to spell years.
---
IMO looks a lot like Leshy.
---
The Icebrood Charr will be Bangar and company, whenever we catch up to them.  Or perhaps sometime after we catch up to them if we still have another encounter or two with "normal" Bangar before he gets corrupted.
---
It definitely won't be a Malyck plot point, because it's the whole premise of this Saga, as opposed to a step in the Sylvari Personal Story that only a third of Sylvari players even get to see.
---
thanks, is it all nodes that are worth?
---
thanks for this info
---
Yeah.. It appears you have to re-enter and complete that story step 8 different times.
---
The same content every update. Meaningless complaining on everything, because people have stokholm syndrome: they prefer to stay and "suffer" instead of just give up on GW2.
---
Maybe the game is not bad. Maybe you're the bad one, because you hate everything.
---
I actually would say, that S4 looks really cheesy. Killing of Tyrene, resurrecting her, fighting big Dragons. For me this looks like fantasy 1o1 textbook.
---
Eventually, over a very long period of time, all home nodes will become worth it.
---
That's an anti-flood measure and also serves as a rate limiter, so that players don't inadvertently DDoS the TP every time a tradeable item is introduced or modified.
---
"Breaking the vault" in Desert Highlands makes my entire Achievement window look unfinished as well :c
---
It was cool, but the flesh puppet should've been Almorra. She should probably have been the boss, too, just to really fuck with us.
---
Did you run autohotkey script as admin? in order this to work, script has to have higher or same priority than game itself.
---
"Loves Charr"
---
What in the racist fuck?
---
Oh yeah, that sucked a lot, espcially since it's kind of worthless, except for the runes.
---
&gt; I'd rather have no story at all if it meant having more stuff to do. 
---
&gt; Story mode is a waste of time and effort 
---
Well, have your opinion, but be aware that there are others and tolerate them.
---
&gt; that shit
---
That's not how you spell tolerance.
---
I see so many people in gold getting anhiliated by them..
---
low effort?
---
Icebrood saga nodes are a mixed bag, they are worth if you're passively going for achievements, but become useless (for now?) afterwards, since we cant convert the currency to anything yet
---
Thanks. Obviously I've been thinking about it for a long time. And that's because how long this has been grating on me.
---
I am *so fucking tired* of being a demigod. I'm so tired of MMO's forgetting what they are.
---
It's awful. Why did the genre go so wrong, with instancing and single player content galore? Why does it seem like every big studio is trying to take the MMO out of my RPG and just make the world into a glorified lobby for whatever they have in place of dungeons?
---
If I articulate what I want well, it's because all I can do is *think* about what I want to play - because nobody has made a game that does it. Or at least, does all of it. And it drives me up the wall.
---
public mode and 7 rangers join.. that kinda sums up the openworld community...
---
Wait to buy the shoulder scarf. It's coming back soon
---
totally okay! thats why I said in my opinion. ;) 
---
its just that these two maps werent received as good as the others in general.
---
Why would anyone, even experienced raiders, do the harder ones if they are just as rewarding as the easier ones? People always look for the easiest way to the most rewards.
---
It's not that I don't want the game to succeed, I like gw2, I just hate that Anet is completely deaf to any feedback from the community.
---
It feels like a kick in the balls compared to GGG, which had exile con this weekend, and showed that they care about their game to the community, and basically killed Diablo 4 before it's release.
---
Compared to that, anet's "forum post" announcement is just depressing.
---
I'm interested to see how it will turn out, whether or not we are actually going to team up with Jormag.
---
Teaming up would give a nice variety of 'dragon bad, slay dragon'.
---
Although one thing I don't get is, why don't we just ask Aurene if we should or shouldn't? I know it would probably make a boring story, but in a situation like that it would be most logical to me. I mean, you got a dragon on your side which you know you can trust, who knows better how elder dragons think, and who has visions of the future (no idea if she can peak into the future on command or not).
---
Different buff on you depending on your answers
---
Speaking from anecdotal evidence and assumptions. I'm sorry, but it's not strong enough a case for me to agree with.
---
Like this one.
---
It's probably called the Boneskinner because Wendigos are characterized by being in a constant state of ravenous starvation (they grow when they eat so that they never become full). They are always depicted as "skin and bones", but "Skinboner" just didn't sound as good as "Boneskinner".
---
I like some. Don't love the GS or the focus, but the Dagger, Staff, Sword, Shield and Bows look really nice.
---
I rly don't see why people are complaining about free content, if it was an expansion sure i would see why the outrage, but its a damn living world ep, like calm tf down
---
Good to know.
---
Also, I like to think of it more like Fire-&gt;Grass-&gt;Water-&gt;Fire. Especially since the colour order matches making it easier to remember.
---
It's short but it feels like a good first chapter. It introduces the new masteries. The map is chock full of fun events that aren't too long, and the blizzard mechanic has a welcome sense of urgency to it. Not to mention that the zone has an eerieness to it they haven't explored before, and I think they made it work. A welcome shift in tone!
---
I also like the tier rewards in the new achievements. It's made me more interested to pick things up on the way, knowing I'll get small nudges and rewards on the fly, rather than one at the far end. The weapons are a little plain but the upgrade method is simple, fairly cheap and gives me a reason to casually revisit this map a dozen times.
---
I do hope they'll pick up the pace and add more layers to the future chapters, but we're off to a good if humble beginning.
---
Yup case in point. It even has gold, so who knows, maybe it will even get a sticky! :D
---
That would have happened sooner ... if Anet were goddamn frank and upfront about their long term plans.
---
You are free to believe whatever you wish. Your belief changes neither the reality nor my own opinion on the matter.
---
I didn't say it *wasn't* cheesy, I just preferred it over Season 3. The whole plotline with Omadd's machine felt gimmicky, the White Mantle/Mursaat stuff could have been great but it felt like it got tossed aside too quickly, the Shining Blade debacle, The cracking of Jormag's tooth being so anticlimactic....
---
Season 4 has it's issues, but all I ever said was that I thought it was better than Season 3.
---
I’m happy with this content. I’ve already made over 200g just selling the restored weapons. Yeah, I wish it was a bit longer and the meta felt more rewarding. My two biggest complaints about Bjora is that I feel like I’m waiting forever for the meta to occur and that the zone events, in comparison to others, reward very few unidentified rares. The lack of those drops definitely cut into the amount of materials I’m usually getting when farming events in any other zone. Also the fact I had to redo the light puzzles again today because they weren’t showing as completed. One of my guildmates hit his 10k achievement box last night only to sign on with 5 fewer points than he had when he logged at 10k.
---
Also, those werewolves during the Fallen Portal event hit like a truck and the constant knockdown gets annoying. Overall, I’m enjoying the zone, quick easy map completion for alts, and the strike mission is fun.
---
I've seen a blue Norn spirit/ghost thing twice now that disappeared in a puff when I approached him.
---
The first time he seemed to be tied to a tree and struggling, the second time he was just resting on top of a small hill. I can't say for sure it was the same Norn both times, I guess, but they looked similar.
---
I don't think I can help you with cosplay (he looks nice btw!) but you'll love current gw2 episode if you haven't played it yet. It reminds me of that episode from volume 6 when they try to find shelter and find the bodies of the people who died in sleep.
---
Yeah I'm a pretty big hypocrit. That was actually my own story and I'm projecting at 2:40 am. I'll stop whiteknighting the other people in this thread if you stop whiteknighting GW1 arenanet devs
---
Ope! That’s a tree. Ope! Another one. Ope! Stupid rock!
---
Would anyone here get some use out of a 10$ Quiznos coupon for Path of Fire expac? I have a spare code for anyone who wants it.
---
And that is why you take a bathroom on conventions.
---
You mean like they did with Mordremoth? I feel like this whispering and stuff is too reminiscent of Mordremoth and Sylvari
---
Didn't know that, good to know I don't have to charge everything all the way up.
---
Yeah, ok, I did regain them now.  AP number doesn't update when you redo these puzzle, but updaters after you relog.
---
&gt;completed 1 mastery and finished strike mission with it (first try gold with lfg, way too easy, can ignore pretty much everything and just dps the bosses)
---
I really wish this game was challenging in PvE. Anyone that has played WoW knows just how mind-numbing LFR is. Yet GW2 take that idea and build a game around it.
---
Why am i able to survive basically all content by just auto attacking? Its stupid and lazy. 
---
World Bosses are a joke. Meta events are a joke. Leveling is a joke. Fractals are a joke. Raids are a joke. Strike missions are a joke. Story is a joke.
---
Try doing a mythic raid, mythic dungeon or even an elite world quest in wow and only press your basic attack. You're going to do nothing and then die. As you should.
---
Shit reminds me of pokemon. Remember in early pokemon you'd actually fail once or twice? Yeah, no longer. Your entire team is level 20 by the time you reach the first gym, who is lvl 14. Exp share means you can grow pokemon for free and so on. No challenge and the result is no fun.
---
Nobody cares that they just caught a rare pokemon. Its meaningless. No one cares that you have a legendary in GW2. Your exotic weapon does more than enough for all content.
---
ArenaNet, please - just make one piece of hard content. Put it out of the way in some corner of a map. You go in, you do the piece of hard content and you get a cool reward. Test it. I guarantee it will be extremely popular. The human mind craves to be challenged.
---
You aren't even farming the rewards of being a facebook game either, as you aren't a subscription game. Your game right now makes literally no sense.
---
would it not just be simpler to say the game is more focused on a casual audience then the hardcore one?
---
This is true, but this is the only mmo if ever played that has this. 
---
Wow, FF, rift etc all never had this and had far bigger auction houses.
---
Yeah. That class knowledge is lacking. It's S/P if you want to spam auto attacks for, at best, less than mediocre DPS. 🙄
---
Thank you!
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Lack of realised potential.
---
You've never watched a game show and seen some idiot pick the wrong answer on the final question and been a little bit annoyed? Course you have.
---
Now invest yourself in it - in this case, play it for thousands of hours. You've seen quality before, you know it can be done. The devs give you something, for 'free' (by the way, they were paid money given to them by the playerbase, just an FYI, NCSoft isn't a charity) , you take a look at it and its medicore.
---
Now, you're right, it is just a living world ep. But thats half the reason people are annoyed. This is a living world ep, we're told it was a new thing, a 'saga.' A saga that would replace an expansion.
---
Let me ask you - would you prefer the current patch over Path of Fire?
---
Vigil Keep instance wasn't updated because of course it wasn't.
---
The heart of the issue is that we really only saved you a little time.
---
Maps are frozen in time, because - how would it work otherwise without phasing.
---
They're pretty handy, if you have the bag space. You'll usually have far more karma than you can spend, so there's not much tradeoff there.
---
Do we need a tome tome yet ? You're not exactly saving space when there's only 1 episode
---
This was a cool episode, a good dark tone to it.
---
But it was hella short.
---
Even shorter than the prologue?
---
I think it's fair to be disappointed by this.
---
They do this thing constantly where characters say half a sentence, stop with three dots and then say something else and it's driving me crazy. Just finish the damn sentence.
---
Since we can value every currency by transforming it into gold, let's value Karma.
---
The only way to dump a lot of Karma fast are [Lost Orrian Jewelry Boxes](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Lost_Orrian_Jewelry_Box) afaik which are \~1 silver for 1k Karma.
---
Now we compare one of your Tools with an Orichalcum one let's say a pick. an Orichalcum Pick is 4 Silver therfore \~4k Karma while your tool is 7.350 Karma and has only half the charges so to for the same amount of Charges on your pick you would spent 14.7k Karma while the Orichalcum one has a Value of 4k Karma.
---
But if you would use for example [this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Leatherworker%27s_Harvesting_Sickle) you get something extra for mining which changes the value of the Tool and you only need another 10 Silver of Value to make up for it. Can you reach that extra 10 Silver? I don't know.
---
I wouldn't care if i were you for 2 reasons:
---
1. even if you go for the industrial one it's a QoL thing. If you harvest something and get attacked and have to kill that you waste time on doing that. Time=Money
---
2. even if you loose a few copper each time you buy those, you spend Karma at the end and Karma is something you will get more than you can ever spend quite fast. As i said the only way to spend a huge amount of Karma is to go to orr and most ppl wont do that just cause it's really unrewarding. 1k Karma for 1 silver is a lot of Karma....
---
imho if you want to use the Karma once just do it. Stop trying to give everything a value otherwise you sit there number crunching to maximize your value until you realize you will make profit but in the time you wasted on doing that you could have made more gold than your new choice will save you in a lifetime.
---
As a small advice: You can also redeem the code directly on the https://account.arena.net - you don't need to login todo that. Incase you want to redeem from a location where you can't access your game :-)
---
its never only one or the other. both sides are guilty.
---
Of course you don't see it because you are playing through it for the first time, you have all the years of content to go through. For veteran players who did all of that years ago and are getting more MTX than content now it's obviously a different story
---
You don’t need to charge up on any essences to open chests, just have the T2 mastery unlocked.
---
And that was a hit and miss since my game time is by far more then most players in this game have. But hey was a good try.
---
&gt;there's nothing ANet can do to satisfy these people
---
elite specs? increased resources for non living world content? raids? fractals? wvw? pvp? Like, its very clear what a portion of players want from the game. You say Anet can do nothing to satisfy these people when its obvious they haven't even made an attempt to address these concerns that have been made over and over again yet ignored. Your statement is ridiculous and your implied insult of labeling discontent players as not "actual players" is the same kind of shortsighted and even toxic excuse the devs use to ignore most criticisms that don't relate to minor issues.
---
Use the raven's statues to get a protective bubble.
---
It's RGB order, easier to remember than grass for computer people like me.
---
Not really working here. Was standing in front of one of the medium chests yesterday (don't remember which one), had the corresponding mastery T2 and also happened to have the essence charge maxed out. Couldn't open the chest.
---
The game is not heading in a direction I don't want, it's not heading in any direction at all, which is obviously concerning. I've quit before Icebrood was even announced, but really hope they'll announce some actual content soon to bring me back
---
It's just a matter of budget vs what you can do. I used to run a computer store many many years ago, that had a mac section. We had a few mac customers. Even a few really long term mac customers. Having that section though didn't really make us money because that space could have been used for something that sold better.
---
We got rid of the mac section (not my decision, but one I agreed with) and we lost some customers due to that, but the over all profits didn't go down. They went up, because the space was worth more than the section.
---
Everything has an overhead. My guess is that's what the Strike Missions are about. They can't really justify putting more money into harder content if they don't get more people to play that content. Strike Missions are meant to be a stepping stone. Some people of course, will try them and find they aren't interested. Some will do them and never "graduate" to raids. Some will move on if they find that content enjoyable. 
---
At the end of the day, you have to look at the reality of the business.
---
One of the devs who worked on Lotro and left said that only 10% of the game's population ever raided or PvPed, but they accounted for 50% of all forum posts. I never forgot that quote. 
---
Seems to me, there's a lot of ire here, but I'm not sure how much, ultimately, that will transfer to in sales.
---
In fact, I think this game would have been stronger if HoT had continued on what they did in the core game, instead of suddenly changing direction.
---
Or look at your keyboard and remember it's RGB.
---
&gt;raids and fractals as major game content
---
What else? The point of a MMO is group-based PvE content, it's neither a good medium for PvP nor single player gameplay, if not those 2 I don't see the point of playing it
---
Ok Boomer
---
I've got all aside from the Domain of Kourna node and I don't regret them though I do gather my home instance almost every day. Only the Kourna one didn't seem worthwhile given that it gives such a low amount of the map currency.
---
Some of the others are really worth it though. For example, I've gotten a couple of Salvaged Excellence (back when they were 900 gold+) by letting my Orrian Pearls build up, converting the other currency to Unbound Magic and salvaging amulets. And it is always really handy to have an excess of the currency, particularly Bloodstone Rubies, for gearing new characters or trying different builds.
---
You can also redeem the cote on the homepage. https://account.arena.net
---
Didn't even saw that
---
Not all, just the ones that completed that story event. It can be done. For example, Zinn shows up in your home instance if you have done the related achievement.
---
The portal scroll for the prologue would presumably belong in the tome as well.
---
FF auction house is so awfull that people run away from it. I dont believe it has even a fraction of the size pf the BLTC even considering the bigger community.
---
You're both right really. Mounts (the Dragon especially...) make threats basically insignificant. I think it'd be a lot more fun with OP's mechanics, but I do think it'd be the least played area as a result. A lot of players like to be able to play predictably and do the same thing most maps previously offer. 
---
Most MMO players simply do content for the rewards, not for the experience itself, so making it more difficult or something new to learn tends to get less players to try it.
---
bad taste
---
It was objectively good...for two hours. Am I gonna get back into an MMO for two hours worth of content? Hell no, and even if I get back it certainly won't keep me around
---
If they can update the Pale Tree for your instance after a certain point in the story, they can update Almorra as well.
---
Its funny you should say that about Pokemon... because i'm trying to fight the Team GO Rocket leaders in Pokemon GO and on my first attempt i got my kitten handed to me and am having to re-evaluate my team/tactics.
---
Thanks!
---
Yeah that’s something I don’t get. I haven’t been playing the game for a year because I picked up a different hobby. I still log in every once in a while to chat with my whole guild.
---
I think it takes some people a long time to learn that people never stop growing, and part of growing is growing apart from other people, and sometimes those other people are game developers and that’s ok.
---
In most cases that's just a mirror of the game
---
That game still exists? I thought it was dead on arrival lol
---
Thank you! I actually tried to do the same, but I needed ppl to help me because I had already opened the chests when I decided to upload this. Sadly an entire 50 squad couldn't help me.
---
If no retcon was made, Glint's Legacy talks about how vacancies in The All must be filled by multiple entities in place of the malevolent Elder Dragons we know - and that they must distribute and share magic (think streams of magic ever flowing in a steady motion between nodes of a system). We have Aurene, but ideally we're missing 5 more entities.
---
But it is nitpicking, as it doesn't really detract from the overall game experience.
---
I can go in all the nitty gritty of it but MightyKeef already made the perfect video that explains the feeling that all us "non-disgruntled veterans" have when we look at the pokemon subreddit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGRpVR588T0
---
It says all gone for me
---
_''Big if true''_
---
you are *technically* correct, the best kind of correct. however i doubt anyone, including ANet, considered that when they made thats statement.
---
I just got one. So still plenty keys left. Was expecting them to be all gone.
---
It probably won't be updated this year (its 1-year anniversary in a week; fuck I'm old) but it'll probably come back next year.
---
They more or less released fractals and raids every year, they stopped abruptly. Had I known they had no plans to make more, I had stopped sooner (and participated less on this sub, thus less "negativity").
---
Same with elite specs. The past schema made players expect an expansion and elite specs two or three years after the previous one. Again, they should have been more upfront about this.
---
Yeah tbh I checked yesterday and it was still slow for me. Am sad. I often rather destroy things than sell it on the TP because it's so slow.
---
Sorry, let me re-phrase, I know you get a black screen for shader compilation, but this seems to be permanant? I've left the game open for over half an hour and nothing has changed
---
No, just no. I'll always put Bungie and destiny as an example. It took Bungie just a couple of months to do a complete change on their stance on communication with the community after d2's release, every one of their "This week at Bungie" blog posts has more content and information than anet's announcement at a freaking venue, and they put out those blog posts on a ***weekly basis***. Stop making excuses for a company that keeps digging their graves deeper by completely ignoring feedback to the point any criticism, no matter how valid, means you get banned from their official forums.
---
Well harvesting 50% faster will give you no extra materials, using the 33% extra strike it the most profitable when harvesting costy items.
---
The whole idea of this is that content will be dropped gradualy instead of all at once, it's not fair comparing this with path of fire, and it's also not fair comparing this to a game show where it would have taken the same ammount of effort for the person to pick the correct answer, making content takes time, and i'm not white knighting the game but how can you call it your favorite game if you turn on it as soon as a mediocre patch drops.
---
Nonsense, you can and could always get into raiding if you put in a modicum of effort. Look up the bosses and join an appropriate guild/group, that's it. I started GW2 raiding around W4 release. That's hardly moving with the wave and yet I'm at \~1500 LI/LD despite missing many weekly kills due to RL. If people haven't killed stuff like VG by now, that's entirely their choice.
---
I am talking about Deap Sea Dragon.
---
Season 2 writing was pretty bad. With exception of the Episode 3/6 (for both S3 and S4), Season 3 was overall definitely better than Season 2.
---
Fortunately it's easy to remember: "RGB".   Red beats green beats blue (beats red).
---
3705 left on NA as of posting
---
It's instant access for all your other characters to get onto the map without having to go through story over and over.
---
Give it time. That was my attitude too at 2 weeks after starting this past April. Fast forward to now, I've completed all story content, done a couple of raids, and uninstalled the game after the 6h of content added by bound by blood.
---
LOL
---
Imagine running around in Dragonfall right now then....?
---
Background?
---
Is it just me or does leveling feel kinda repetitive? Go here, kill that, protect these guys, trigger this cue, talk to that person, rinse and repeat. I know this is the essence of all MMORPGs but is there any way to spice this process up? I'm really scared that I'll hit the level 80 mark, feel like I've accomplished something only to find that gameplay from level 80 onwards is just the same stuff, go here, kill that, protect these guys, trigger this cue, talk to that person, rinse and repeat. And due to my hardware and geographical limitations, playing with tons of other people is really not a sustainable option. This is why:
---
I think I finally found the reason why I keep switching and engrossing myself deeply from class to class. The absolute furtherest I've gotten with any class is level 53 as thief before it got boring and so far I've played a bit of every class (except Revenant cuz I don't have expansions as of yet). This may be an attempt at making the game funner for myself but of course, the big issue is, by switching from class to class requires me to not dedicate any time to any specific character meaning I get no real meaningful progress. It's almost like I'm trading meaningful progress for enjoyment which is obviously unsustainable.
---
On a small side note/tangent I'm starting to think that this endless process of doing the same thing, getting better gear only to face harder enemies balances out, and that there's no real net reward, and that gaming tricks us into feeling that immediate sense of feedback with increasing numbers of damage, healing or whatnot that we just see on a screen, and that ultimately gaming in general amounts to nothing in life and that this is why I was able to break myself off from League of Legends after 7 years and that these 7+ years of gaming and investing my time and energy ultimately amounts to zero actual life progress and doesn't make me a better member of society, neither is it actually productive, even if it does serve as personal entertainment since positively productive and constructive entertainment does exist and is readily available to anyone that actually wakes up from this paralyzing and blinding cycle of unproductive and thus pointless entertainment and takes on the challenge of improving their lives by maximizing their potential as a human being and technically in the larger scheme of things help increase the rate of human progress as a species.
---
Is GW2 actually gonna help me break my gaming addiction?
---
And finally, what's the major difference between Firebrand and Dragonhunter?
---
Which instance is it?
---
to me it was clear from when first announced, that this expansion-worthy feature would not be that great. Why lock loot behind a mastery?
---
As for the dps/boons side, it was (in my opinion) aimed for the new and lvl 80 boosted players, in their PTV gear. You must keep one thing in mind: there are players who still don't know combat mechanics, such as CC, boons and what they do.
---
I really enjoyed listening to these! The new bits of lore are interesting, of course, but the nornbear stuff was nostalgic to listen to as well. Especially since the norn who was telling the story was voiced by Kari Wahlgren, who I believe was the original VA for Jora back in Eye of the North (her voice had some heavy post-processing effects so I'm not 100% sure, would love a dev confirmation on that).
---
&gt;as Sylvari were one big hive mind
---
Not really. Firstly, all dragon minions are in a hive mind with their Elder Dragon and each other. But sylvari were different, because they had no such connection. The Dream of Dreams is rather explicitly stated to not be a hive mind as well. Mordremoth had to hijack the Dream of Dreams in order to access to sylvari's minds (which he could do thanks to this Mind domain so you're right there - Kralkatorrik took the Mind domain and used it to give branded shared cognitive recognition; it'll be curious how other ED use it, if they get it).
---
Because fanning the flames is so much more enjoyable then being a big brain and accepting that theres grey areas between black and white. Who needs constructive criticism anyway.
---
Essence Manipulator 101 is to blame. It has you "charge up" on essences in order to use an "essence skill" on the dummy and then open an essence chest. One might be led to believe they have to be charged up in order to be able to open the chest.
---
It also seemed to be a callback to Joko. The body movements, his jaw being broken and almost detached, and the cadence of his voice all made me think of that scene with Joko.
---
Because fanning the flames is so much more enjoyable than being a big brain and accepting that theres grey areas between black and white. Who needs constructive criticism anyway.
---
What was wrong with the fight? I thought it was a bit more challenging than the standard but fun.
---
I've been playing for almost 2 years now casually and for me it's the best mmo ever. Yes it has its flaws but it's fun, and as I mostly pvp and take my time going through stories I have so much content to explore still.  I think this sub has a lot of hardcore veteran players that have completed all the stories, played all the fractals and done all the raids, so there's nothing new for them. Just stuff like collections and legendaries. So they are hungry for something new to keep them occupied for a while.
---
While that's understandable I wish they would tone things down a bit because they are driving new players away
---
Ah what? Is this a copypasta?
---
Certainly someone can't be this delucional right?
---
&gt;Good size, good amount of content, great story, 
---
Really? The map is smaller than the actual prologue, takes about 20 minutes to explore, the story takes 30 minutes to finish, it has less achivements than most maps and It didn't even ship with a legendary or a fractal or something to give it replayability. 
---
Where are you getting the "good content" and "good size" from?
---
As if the story, yeah yeah subjective or whatever, but birdemic is not on the level of breaking bad and the way Almorra's death (i.e. her death getting the same reaction and focus of a random dead npc just to generate shock value), a very important character that's been around literally since before the game even existed is just bad/lazy from a writing perspective. 
---
Especially if your character was originally from vigil.
---
I've seen people day "iTs sYmBoLiC ThAt's hOw pEoPlE DiE IrL WiThOuT FaNfArE", except this isn't the real life. This is a game trying to tell an enganging story, and certain writing conventions, like focusing on important character deaths, are there because they work.
---
Also, everyone knew what the whispers were (And they are the biggest horror movie cliche ever). There was no mystery there for the player. Now that the characters know what they are too just, don't do what they say? Of course we all know eventually somebody's gonna get ahold of ball and listen to them despite knowing where they come from just to progress the story at some point.
---
It is not hard to update it just for the players that did the story. I really enjoyed how Destiny 2 world is updated based on the campaign step you are doing. I think they can easily do it, it would make the world feel more alive.
---
Adding to my previous comment I must say however knowing ArenaNet for far too long it may very well be the first and last Boneskinner and it wouldn't be the first time the hype up didn't meet expactations. That lore bit surely is creating hope, but I wouldn't place my bets on it because that one Boneskinner already got an event with NPCs talking as if its the only one around there. That norn lady really is the only NPC talking if there can be multiple.
---
saga episodes will release in the months which don't have a festival.
---
Ah yes, the oppressed minority of people outraged at Anet, usually such a quiet and respectful group
---
"DON'T CRITICIZE THE GAME I LOVE IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT JUST DONT PLAY IT"
---
that\_shaman datamined the actual size... so I guess they will expand it with the next episode  
---
 [https://twitter.com/that\_shaman/status/1197165580467478529/photo/1](https://twitter.com/that_shaman/status/1197165580467478529/photo/1)
---
I thought Jormag's powers were charm and smooth talking which is different from mind control.
---
&gt;Hell, even the whole "sylvari are dragon minions" was totally unnecessary addition for how much they used it.
---
iirc that's because the expac was rushed so they had to make cutbacks on the story. (Among other things)
---
You can't just write "fucking" whenever you want. Manners.
---
Not sure about Fallen yet, but for Aberrants, there's an event - which is even required for the main story - which helps explain it. Sons of Svanir necromancers are pulling what seem to be pieces of victims' souls to create [Nightmares](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Nightmare) in the form of aberrants. The necromancers can even take pieces of the PCs' soul to create Aberrant copies of the PC.
---
I'm **guessing** that the Fallen are individuals who have given in to Jormag's temptations, as there is dialogue about them serving Jormag in some patrol events. However, they've not yet become corrupted by Icebrood. Which makes me think they're individuals who succumbed to whispers, not ice magic.
---
/r/whoooosh
---
Riftstalkers were explained though.
---
Some weird statistic must show that people like to push big cute looking buttons. At least theres no flare like in ESO - yet.
---
Bruh do you even fact check anything? They said some maps will expand over episodes like this one will in episode 2 and they've changed their release schedule to be every other month instead of 4 months. Feels like you're just reinforcing his point.
---

Almost every post gets downvoted.
---
Wiki has no content yet on this and sub is pointlessy full of people who say they did everything doable with patch but not a single useful post on how to complete this stuff.
---
Btw I am quite sure about the collection part
---
It wasn't really that special. Balthazar giving orders to his hounds was nice flavour but the fight was like fighting 2 respawning veterans.
---
its pretty chill if you arent a hardcore player.
---
Tx
---
thank you. I wanted todo this but you did a good job.
---
fuck this meme template really. fucking strawman. and fuck the other thread.
---
The episode we kill Joko had a cutscene that was of the same quality with us in it. If I remember correctly, that episode was delayed and had some serious bugs. Maybe programming all the possible looks The Commander can have is why so they decided not to this time to save themselves the headache.
---
Was expecting our character to show up as he did with joko final cutscene and LS4 finale...I felt kinda left out.
---
Yeah, it's also a bit strange if you play the original GW2 story and have missions in old Lion's Arch.
---
Character selection screen.
---
I *want* to see criticism, but there's a big difference between being critical of something and having a cheerio pissing contest of "NO U I AM THE LOUDEST."
---
This just sounds like a fake complaint to simply make a thread of "GW1 is far better than GW2 and GW2 sucks." Further supported by the OP's comment "Because 1 is a perfect implementation."
---
At that point, quickly realised it's just one of those threads.
---
yes, both are available at the merchant.
---
No, it doesn't work well.
---
The no nameplates thing would be cool. Good idea.

Cough...cough.....Materials bags.....https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Festive_Bag_of_Materials

But we do know their financial situation, you just need to google it.

ITT: GW2 players trying to learn about the concept of having an opinion on art, and that some people actually like stuff they don't personally like.
---
To do list after update:
---
- Do the Meta 23 times
---
- Do the raven shrine story step 6 times
---
- Grind a shit ton of the new currency (weapons)
---
- Wait for the light puzzle AP being fixed then do them
---
- Do some random event 12 times.
---
- Do the strike mission everyday ( because i love them)
---
Thank you so much for wanting to share this with the community, but we've already had two threads about this that are on the front page. Therefore i've removed this one.
---
People enjoy complaining and in-fighting more than they enjoy playing the game, that’s been pretty constant for the past 7 years.
---
Aaaand isn’t limited to just GW2, seems to be the case with a lot of games.
---
"If you don't like this sub go post somewhere else"
---
There are still around 225 employees who seem to be playing with their toes. The real question is what all these people are actually doing when the actual dev team is only a handful instead of the focus being on the 140 odd lay-offs and how that effects the game.
---
sperg
---
It's why no-one takes anything seriously if the internet is involved. Shit that would get you kicked in the teeth is normal here, and criticizing this shitstain behaviour is white knight shill fanboy talk. Because nothing matters and anything is made up anyway. Legitimate issues are being drowned out in such hilarious amounts of made up bullshit that it doesn't matter anymore what anyone says anyway, because every sane person dismisses that kind of having a conversation from the get go. And it gets justified by 'but they don't listen to us otherwise', as becoming a screeching, shit-flinging chimpanzee would change that.
---
All the butthurt of a wife-beating drunkard because they get ignored by the powers that be. Impotant rage that I would be ashamed to be caught dead with, but on the internet it's not only perfectly acceptable, it's a sign of love. Yeah. Stop making me abuse you, just start being better.
---
Ah, Meme Wars, the true endgame for the sub.
---
Yeah, that one actually really worked. Just mark them as spam afterwards.
---
I'm on the fence about that one, what with the fact that it might not even exist.
---
I pretended to be from Idaho and there were 3300 keys left.
---
Well, that's what I mean. Feel free to hate the quantity of content. I absolutely agree with you there. Quantity-wise, it is extremely lacking. All I'm saying is, don't judge quality by quantity.
---
I don't even play this game and only found this post by sorting /r/all by 'rising', but I agree. It's like that in absolutely every game.
---
They ain't cranking them at all*
---
The guide posted by /u/Shabangbang does say that, but I failed to find any after searching for quite a while. I've never found one outside of those events, to be honest.
---
Since I often see people asking on map chat "where to find Aberrant Wargs" and the event chain, though not the only way, it's a sure (and potentially quicker) way to find them, I thought it would be worthwhile to post this.
---
Are you sure the wargs you found in the forest weren't there because of the event?
---
Oh, I'm aware, and I'm glad you made the distinction!
---
Superior Sigil of Life

but no WvW infusions and +5 +9 instead.
---
i still would assume that's a WvW build
---
[btw Metabattle has allready a heal shout warrior build for WvW](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Spellbreaker_-_Shoutbreaker)
---
&gt; but how can you call it your favorite game if you turn on it as soon as a mediocre patch drops.
---
This patch is just a rotten cherry on a pile of bullshit anet been serving since pof itself. Now, when anet supposedly refocused on the game and axed like 3/4 of it, they still somehow managed to fuck up their grand opening. All the hate and memes are 100% justified.
---
...honestly, I'd shill out for gem store nipple rings.
---
circling back around to willful ignorance.
---
They are not wrong tho
---
You know u could be right ? As a programmer I would have hidden the old button and added a new one . The two buttons call two different to client. They may look the same to you but they are not.
---
This would justify the new icon too.
---
But
---
When they coded the bar they set that buttons must be queued at the end. Maybe the are indexed on an array so adding in the middle could ruin something
---
After the cutscene the NPCs around realize that based off the timing, the call from Almorra to get us out to the Marches was likely from a corpse puppeted Almorra.
---
It's nice. Our public pug group even got a successful kill (no bonus chests and only 1 or 2 players had mastery out of 7 players total).
---
Secret was to kill both polar bears same time, which raised difficulty quite much, but still keeping it real fun encounter. It needs some communication, some healing, some well-timed dodges and some position awareness, though no-one said anything in my group. Difficulty is on-spot.
---
Can't wait for next week! This week I try to get at least the bonus chests.
---
Btw I forgot to pick up reward chest from the kill after leaving. Was worried, but then the NPC sent the forgotten reward chest trough mail. New undocumented feature?
---
Norn are the same.
---
This sub is getting more and more useless every day passing
---
iirc i read somewhere that they will slightly update this boss aswell.
---
Great meme, friend.
---
Press O on your keyboard
---
[Here you go.](https://i.imgur.com/5omBGvV.png)
---
Indeed, but I think the cutscene would've been much cooler if it was a character we kinda sorta cared about, at least had some relation to. Imagine following, then fighting Almorra, thinking she's under Jormag's influence, only to find out she's been nothing but a moving sack of bones the entire time. Would've fit better with the horror theme they were going for imo.
---
Late respons i avoid reddit during story patches. 
---
I know what my server are and what it is not. I been on it for 6 years and seen all the good and the bad. And i totally agree with you that Gandara is nothing like WSR, and were you feel that is a bad thing (or so i read it at least), that is why i am still on this server. 
---
Gandara still have a comuntiy. Probably the only server with a intact comunity not broken by a link or a bandwagon attempt. There have been tries were players and guilds have joined to "organize" us, all of them have failed because we do it our way. 
---
For you or so i understand you feel having a organized pug zerg is the only thing that is WvW, but you forget that it is not what WSR is most of the time. Most of the time WSR is a pug zerg pushing with two guilds, 3 dragon banners and 3-4 AMX guys pulling the comander, fighting outside SM with enemy pugs on the wall on a shit ton of siege hitting from every were. That is mostly what you face when playing against WSR.
---
Yes i know this is not what you meant or talked about and i do know what you mean with organized but from other servers point this is what you mostly have to deal with when you are up against WSR. And not only Gandara, most servers will leave the tier that WSR are in because they simply don't that sort of WvW in the long run. 
---
Fighting comanders who are organized in a zerg against us without the apeshit i described above is something that Gandara also do enjoy. But that rarely happen but when it does then it is fun. How ever when it happens another thing usually follow up. Because in those situations it happens that we win fights as well. And if we win more then 2-3 fights enemy comander tags down. And that is something i also don't understand. Why do they do that? Is it not good if there sometimes are even fights between us? It does not happen that often since on prime it is usually the shit fest i described above, so when it happens then how come we come back 15 times to try again and the enemy com leaves after 3 losses?   
---
Also remember that servers are still servers outside of prime, and comanders comes in all shapes and forms and we fight those too and that are just normal fights were sometimes we roll, sometimes enemy and sometimes it is even. That is also WvW.
---
Note though i am not argue about what WSR do or don't, all server do what they feel is their way, just giving you another pov what we and other servers face do not always fit your description and ofc sometimes it does.
---
How ever you claim Gandara to not have pugs coming on TS and follow comander. We do, but what we don't have a overload of are the fanboys who accept anything and everything a comander say and do. 
---
So for example if there is a comander going apeshit on you for reasons that are not really about the pugs but about the comander being a kid throwing a fit in a candy store in a way that is beyond acceptable then yes that person wont have that many people joining ts. That person will have to adjust and learn how to tell people off without using words most people would not even repeat in a dark wardrobe.
---
Note that this do not mean you have to be the carebear sweetheart who hug us every time we make a fight, we have comanders telling us we are doing shit and if the com is right then we can take that and make a better try. Sometimes it works, sometimes not, it also obviously depends on the people who are running with the comander as well. If too many are randoms then yes it wont work that well. 
---
Also Gandara have a lot of roamers i guess those are the one you call soloplayers. This is something that i don't feel is a bad thing. Romers take care of home border and comanders rarely get calls to home because they kill off most things that comes there, even blobs. Whilst on other servers there is a constant call for help in team chat because 4 enemies are somewere taking something. On Gandara we try to accept both groups and work with that. Mostly that works fine, sometimes there is tensions but Gandara remains the same and we are a bit of everything. If it did not work at all we all would have left long time ago so obviously we have something positive going on :)
---
If i would give one advice or at least say one thing then if a enemy comander is looking for fights and they are up against Gandara. If that comander join our homeborder then the only thing they will fight are roamers and a hight number of them. If we have most of our roamers on they will pick off blob and cloud it and they will defend the structures. That is the fight a enemy comander will have on our homeborder like 99% of the time. If a enemy comander want fights then our homeborder should be the last option to go too. Instead ask the com we have to move to another border and he/she will if there is room to do the jump. Our homeborder usually have to many players on it to fit a blob from us and why you wont find fights there. If the comander goes anyway then you will have the cloud there. 
---
Note i dont say the com should not go there, if that is what the com want then they should by all means do it. But if the com look for fights that do not involve clouding then yeah pick another border. It really is that simple.
---
Anyway this became way to longer then i intended but i just felt i had to at least describe what we are and what we are not because sometimes when i read your responses about Gandara i don't really recognize what you say.
---
Mate I am so old that internet did not exist so if I got stuck in a game you had to hope someone in school had it and did what blocked u. It took me two months before I found a guy who knew how to start the train on Mars on Zack McCracken.
---
So
---
To me a guide here is not to make things easier cause I am old and I do not care about how long is other'sdick not I want merit for anything on a game.
---
I am so old that I like to share experience and talk about game. 
---
Hey I found this here. No maybe it's there. I miss dulfy comment section where ppl added info as soon as they were discovered and then they get put in guide form.
---
What I see is just a sub circlejerking about nothing
---
I disagree with the second part of your sentence - my semi hc raid static is surprisingly having a lot of fun on the new mission (although we were very disappointed with the first one) - we spent few h yesterday just on trying out different comps to see which one will help us melt the boss in the shortest time with no healer- rn we are down to 1 min kill with (boss dies before cc bar is up), but we were 8-9manning it. With 10man we will try to go for less than 40sec. This is really fun and refreshing.
---
This mission imo works well as "introduction to raids" for more casual players, as they can see mechanics which are later seen in raids - cc (and consequences of failed cc), AOEs, coordination within the squad. People cannot expect that you can kill bosses by pressing 1 with your eyes closed, not caring for positioning or using proper skills when necessary.
---
Yeah. They also said that Hot will launch with a full set of legendaries. This company has a history of lying.
---
Is it really this hard to get globs of ectoplasm or is it just me. I have 5 lvl 80 characters. I’ll run world bosses for a long time and salvage maybe 5. I did daily fractals last night with my guild and got three. I have no ambitions to do WvW or PvP but maybe that’s where you get more?  And is this directly related to my luck level?  I VERY rarely get exotic drops and few enough rares.
---
Now do a concert with [orchestral weapons](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Orchestral_weapon_skins).
---
You could make this meme with the roles reversed and also be accurate. It's a matter of perspective and the tropes above purposefully paint one group of players in a good light and one in a bad light.
---
It comes in positivity/negativity waves ive noticed.
---
Each time I did it it felt I was back on AC P3 or CoF P2 when I know I should not be looking at the timer/progress because I know it's going to be disappointing :p
---
Brilliant and so true :D
---
Thank you.
---
That's my vision of this sub for years, thanks. Downvoted tho.
---
THAT perfectly sums up your frustration when comparing gw2 to gw? 
---
....lol okay
---
All they did was to keep disappointing players so they leave and the TP gets faster, smart move!
---
I guess it scales very harshly because I've only done it at times with many people around and the event was non-stop mobs rushing in. Mostly if not only Veterans and Elites that also could take quite a beating. I do agree however that the event feels like its dragging.
---
PoF maps have 29 HP challenges for a total of 290 hero points. Since an elite specialization takes 250 hero points to fully unlock, even if you got some from Core Tyria maps, you would still need to get some points from HoT maps to fully unlock both specs.
---
If you find HoT maps too intimidating, you can regularly check the LFG for "HP trains" to get those much more easily (they might require certain masteries unlocked to follow them). There are also a lot of hero points that are simply a commune, no fighting required, just a bit of exploration to get to them. All the HPs in Dragon's Stand are communes, for example, so after completion of the meta you can grab some really easy ones.
---
They said the Saga would include expansion level content. They never said each episode would include expansion level content.
---
I think this new zone is like Dry Top when it first came out. We got it in pieces. There were three instances in the first chapter, and you just explored what was about a third of that zone. Two later chapters added the rest of the zone.
---
Ever had some Mexican food right before falling asleep ? Multiply that times Elder Dragon and you have the answer.
---
Yes no problem! :) Just curious why Kourna was recived bad back then.
---
Sadly to some it's more important that they can check it off the list in a short amount of time rather than the actual detail, work and effort put into making it, the kind of people who'd go to an art gallery, run all the way through only glancing at the paintings then complain when they seen everything once.
---
I played it on full map... Squad is on 50/50 and people can't join map. And the mobs are really few. (unless no ones clearing the portals) if you don't clear the portals then it's actually a good and engaging meta. But people clear portals which is the right thing to do.
---
I say that because the only for such a downgrade is a lack of care and attention, which is the cause of a lot of the problems with GW2. 
---
So yes, it perfectly sums up my frustration with GW2.
---
Someone gets it.
---
Flashpoint had my favorite boss fight in season 3. It wasn't too complicated and felt epic and fun.
---
scroll scroll
---
"we want to introduce expansion like features within living story episodes" was the phrase used, it was in a video and I don't think the term's been used since. 
---
I can't find it in print, nor can I find the video, only reference to the video [here](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/79677/will-we-ever-see-another-expansion-class-race) .
---
If that's what they're still planning on, then it would be delivered over the course of the saga. We have no idea how long the saga is going for. So it may take a while for these things to kick in.
---
Yep, the LWS dailies, yesterday only gave me 1 chest, instead of 3 chests. I will check again today and report back.
---
But isn't that the point - to play to get achievs, instead of looking for guide?
---
Playing by guide is similar to not playing at all.
---
Actually, on explosion it also didn't damage our shrine, but only the players, and it didn't one shot either (reduced to ~500 HP)
---
Yup, EU. I usually play on the evenings and weekends but I haven't been able to find any trains. Maybe I've just been unlucky though and been playing on off days.

pvp reward track = 6 weapons

Yes please
---
&gt; The chucklefuck that designed it
---
I don't like the new mastery either, but personal insults like this are uncalled for.
---
That’s perfectly fine! Whatever helps you remember it is fine by me.
---
Would 16:00 CET this Saturday be OK? Starting on VB-&gt;AB-&gt;TD.
---
But there's also (as far as I've seen) so sign of an entry point where Bangar and his followers would have entered Bjora Marches. Not even a collapsed cave.
---
Just seems like a real step backwards in map continuity. I thought they'd do better after they updated the gap between Jahai Bluffs and Domain of Kourna. That was really cool of them.
---
Wow, that's.. weird. Then what exactly damages the shrines? I ran the meta like 8 times and so far only once I saw the shrine health go down to like 75% but then it was back to 100% shortly after
---
lmao what did I do, I just meme about video games man - my viewers don't post here and neither do I unless I've got tournaments to share.
---
Ye that was my initial idea, but then I remembered that it is way easier to write bot to use keybind rather than mouse click.
---
Exactly, at least this sub lives up to its title
---
It’s more like a combination of factors. The toxicity, elitism, etc. prevents the raid audience from expanding. The audience not expanding causes Anet - looking at the actual data of how much of their audience actually plays raids - to question the cost effectiveness of pouring development dollars into developing more raid content. Raid content not coming out fast enough causes raiders to move on to other games.
---
Part of this sub has a vendetta against veteran players. Content creators are generally not the people who started 2 months ago and play 4 hours a week.
---
Hey my personal little monkey. I know the state of wvw better than you do because you detest the gamemode, and you're too dumb for thinking.
---
Also helps if I'm still in contact with active guilds and players. People who actually grasp wvw and play it actively. Unlike you. 
---
And with respect to gandara, nothing much changed. Same server culture, same guilds.
---
ANet can't afford to alienate the MMO audience who look for endgame PvE content to keep them interested. Right now, ANet is not providing any sort of incentive with that; you don't retain players with pretty visuals masking up the lack of effort in designing the in-game activities.
---
Raids and fractals can apply to both casual and hardcore players. There's no reason to exclude either. Other MMOs provide different modes on encounters by changing stats, enemy spawns, and game mechanics that are only available in higher difficulty modes (like challenge mode represents in fractals).
---
I fear if they do that, the TP will go back to being slow and buggy again.
---
Uh does it mean you can spam the same achievement chest everyday if you close to one. (the one in the UI)
---
PROLOGUE which was promoted as FILLER MAP,has 4 DIFFERENT META EVENTS,5 mini games,3 races,INFUSION 4 DIFFERENT BACK ITEMS,3 ARMOR PIECES,JUMPING PUZZLE and 54 ACHIVEMENTS ! FIRST SAGA map have 1 clusterfk of the meta,15 ACHIVEMENTS, 1 back piece,1 armor piece (absolutly useless upgrade weapon collection) and its copy/paste of thunder peak map. Do you understand now why are ppl upset?
---
The mobs running up to it (except the bombers lel) can damage the shrine i think, and indeed the shrine becomes full hp again after being untouched for a certain time or something
---
Probably. I'll try to be there.
---
of course they do, but if you have a shortcut you can set, it would be stupid to train your bot what the bot has to click.
---
What the...
---
At first I fully stacked certain color to open it. Later I thought I just need to have at least one piece to open it and now I hear I just need to have unlocked mastery? Dayum.
---
Well you can buy any LS4 currency with those new ice shards...
---
So you don't play but know better than someone who currently does?
---
That doesn't work. You don't like this game anymore. You don's play it anymore. Lease the subreddit. You don't belong here.
---
Or you can buy portable MF for 30ish gold (i think) and a infinity salvage kit and save time. In both cases, converting 1 currency to another one at the same rate you can simply get the other one nad not spend 1st currency is bad.

Black LLAMA Trading Company
---
This is why individually paid-for episodes is going to be the death of the game. As long as they keep doing that, the ability to reuse locations is cut off and they only restrict themselves more.
---
This is why Current Events and LS1/LS2 had such cool things going for them. They took place in familiar areas. Plus, after-expansion content has typically allowed players to revisit expansion maps, giving those some new reasons to be explored in a continuous world.
---
LW becoming the core of the game's narrative only hurts more as we continue forward as long as they continue this pattern of "we can only play in the bounds of the newest map." They need to realize the value of reusing previous maps, both from core/expansions and from previous Living World seasons/episodes.
---
*Grabs Popcorn*
---
Let them fight!
---
&gt; I see a lot of criticism of the new map that I think is unwarranted. I think it's largely fine. Good size, good amount of content, great story, great meta. 
---
Is this an out of season april fools joke?
---
Please, stop. I'm starting to think I'm getting blind with age.
---
Ah, it's what the other commenter posted as well. Thanks. I'm never sure if guides that are over a year old are still relevant.. having played some MMOs things tend to change pretty drastically from time to time, so I usually just disregard anything that is more than a couple of months old. :p
---
We should make flairs for different guilds on the sub and meme war against each other.
---
SWTOR and FF14 blow GW2 out of the window when it comes to storytelling.
---
Good thing we've got content in the form of strike missions then.
---
Your comments on the story are opinion only. I actually preferred this story to the prologue story, which had a ton of running around and talking.
---
The achievements in the last episode were some of the grindiest I've seen. So many to get the zone meta.  Let's kill 100 devourer nests.  Kill 500 rabid fans at a concert. Shoot 300 targets.  You may prefer that kind of content, but I don't.
---
Everyone has a preference. I love a lot of the minigames in the last zone, but as a guy who repeats stories and zones on multiple characters, I'm liking this new zone far better.
---
Uh bad at fashion war is also a raider thing, I see you with your glowy ass infusion, you damn stains on the world.
---
Still waiting for the game to release real armor pieces in game. Phalanx set is all we have and I refuse to pay for fashion, kinda remove the fun of it.
---
You haven't posted a single on topic post in this thread.
---
You may agree with what I say, but you've not posted anything relevant here. You dont offer any value. Just an attempt to harass people you disagree with.
---
You're not a mod and you're not batman. You dont hold any power here even if you spam report every post make.
---
Yeah I guessed so :)
---
Before I even saw there was an achievement, I wrote down my choices so I pick the opposite ones when I do story with my other account (probably today or tomorrow).
---
You hate the game and don't play anymore. Leave the community. We don't want you, we don't need you. You are a troll. Leave.
---
Just IMAGINE   
---
If the story only updated if you have completed the last episode of LS and were not on a previous episode that requires the NPC. In that case, you could still log into the legacy instance.
---
I understand that there is a challenge to going fast, but your example is an event where 80 people are involved.
---
The best player in the world is meaningless when in a crowd of 80 people. Your contribution is so little that if you afk, as many people do, no one really notices or cares.
---
Thats a problem. Thats a problem with that type of gameplay inherently. Any time you find that gameplay in any game, its terrible. Alterac Valley or World Bosses in WoW for instance, are both a joke as well.
---
But the difference is, most games don't build their entire game around these mindless zergs. GW2 does. 
---
If you aren't being challenged, your mind quickly wanders. Some people cope with Netflix, most just ask themselves what the fuck they're doing and then log off for a year.
---
Like i said, speedrunning is indeed difficult, but it is incredibly niche. Most people don't give a shit whether they opened a jar of pickles in 0.03 seconds or 3 seconds. They just don't give a shit. Dragon's Stand is as difficult as opening a jar of pickles. Perhaps even less so, as you can't literally AFK and hope that the jar of pickles opens itself.
---
WoW recently had a 'skill challenge' called the mage tower. The mage tower was fairly unique based on your specialisation, so 36 mostly unique challenges. Completely solo. For very experienced players and end game raiders, this would require around 10-50 attempts. For less experienced players, it could take them hundreds of attempts.
---
It was one of the most universally loved pieces of content they ever put in the game. People crave challenge, even casual players. 
---
There is no challenge in guild wars 2 if you don't pvp. If you do pvp, you just run into bots and assholes that AFK within the first 30 seconds.
---
That, to me, is GW2s biggest problem. There is no difficulty at all. Your hardest raids are comparable to normal mode WoW raids, perhaps even easier. Compare this to GW1 where you had hardmode for the ENTIRE world and all of the missions and dungeons.
---
Yeah, i loved it!!! We went there after raids and it was super fun!!!
---
Shame it's faster than the grothmar one..
---
Yeah, prologue was really good, but I don't see how that changes anything that was said above about your hearts/bounties/leggies/infusion. Go repeat hearts/bounties and farm the same meta events daily (for that SWEET FRESH INFUSION THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ANYWAYS BUT CLAIM "IT'S CONTENT!") on previous maps if that's what you really want from this game.  
---
&gt;FIRST SAGA map (PROMOTED AS CONTENT HEAVY WITH EXPANSION LIKE FEATURES)
---
So you ACTUALLY thought that EACH SINGLE EPISODE will feature EXPANSION-LIKE CONTENT? YOU FUCKING ANIMAL.
---
Ah ok, ty for insight. I thought he made that up for his own mnemonic (which I'm totally fine with).
---
Never played any Pokemon game. I was playing meccano and reading books while kids my age were playing the first games (yellow/blue/red/green or whatever was the order), never caught up since :D
---
SW:TOR is a unholy flesh puppet abomination puppeteered by EA's warty cock though, so ... eh. RIP, it didn't deserve its fate.
---
Ok, there's a lot of words in your post and I admit I didn't read it all so I'll try to respond...

Leveling 1-80 is the tutorial part of the game. You need to find the best way **for you** to level. The most interesting way is to do dynamic events (orange markers/circles on the map.) This will keep you interested but still challenge you a bit. Once you start actually playing the game at lvl80 you will be showered with experience tomes, and you will become much more efficient with the game that leveling will be very fast.  
---
By never reaching 80 you are stuck in the tutorial part again and again.  
---
FB vs DH - FB is more support/utility oriented with the tome mechanic, some support builds like quickbrand allow it to still do good power damage, and there's some condi dps builds out there.  
---
DH is burst power DPS with some utility. It has the addition of trap mechanics.
---
What's your problem again?
---
I hate how the game is full of entitled, toxic carebears like you. They put a strain on the community and gameplay to the point it is no longer enjoyable.
---
Leave and take your carebears with you. Go play a mobile game like real casuals. Then gw2 can be enjoyable again. :)
---
Finished. Good luck
---
God, yes. I'd gladly give away the entire map for ten more hours of that. That story part was fucking amazing.
---
Instead of coming up with much needed content like **new guild missions** , they are actually copying old ass guild missions and releasing it as "new content" smh
---
???
---
Constructive criticism is fine, my interpretation of this is people who go into discussion threads just to post their hot takes on how bad the game is are the problem.
---
Change Vital Persistence to Fear of Death and you are all up to date ez
---
You're the toxic one. Insulting anyone who doesn't play like you. If people want to be casual in the game? Awesome! People want to be hardcore? Awesome! People want to be elitist - people like you - and tell people how they have to play? Wrong! People who don't even play wanting to tell people how to play? Wrong!
---
Leave. You don't belong here.
---
Fsp hasn't been ppk focussed for years. The group that is currently wsr is what carried fsp's ppk.
---
You proudly state acs are part of the game and siege monkeys have skill, while pretending you're a ppk server.
---
How does that work ?
---
&gt; Most MMO players simply do content for the rewards, not for the experience itself
---
This is because MMOs use psychology to hook you into craving the action-reward cycle and anything that interrupts you makes you feel like an addict that can't get a hit.
---
ofc i did HEARTS,BOUNTIES,RACES AND META EVENT FOR CHANCE TO GET INFU,I DID ALL OF THAT ON MAPS,WHY I CANT DO IT HERE????????? BCS ITS NOT HERE,THERES NOTHING,NADA,0,EMPTINESS,LACK OF EVERYTHING,WHY SHOUD I GO TO OLD MAPS??????????????????? WHATS THE POINT OF NEW MAP THAN???????????????? WTF,YOU RABIT EVEN BABLING ABOUT? YES EVERY SINGLE EPISODE SHOUD FEATURE SOME KIND OF EXPANSION LIKE CONTENT,LIKE MEANINGFULL MASTERY,SWISS TOURNAMENTS,ALLIANCES,BUILD TEMPLATES,FRACTALS,RAIDS. how ppl are getting so dumb as you,isnt even mystery... you are just rabits,milions of them and every new one is dumber than last....
---
Teq/TT style event is in episode 2 I belive, Drakkar is confirmed to be a world boss.
---
You haven't played for who knows how long yet you still tell people how to play.
---
Yes. Anet changed one trait in soulreaping, you pick the master middle trait if you want more health or the bottom one if you want longer fear and lf regeneration through fear. 
---
Placing shades should be done carefully as they make you not trigger shroud skills around the character anymore. 
---
There is a new shroud called harbinger shroud in scourge master bottom line that triggeres a massive 10 man barrier after a short delay. It's really great when combined with Life from Death as you can trigger burst heal everyone. With F3 and harbinger shroud you can give 50% barrier to EVERYONE. It's insane at vg for example.
---
Most important thing in the game needs to be more visible, you know
---
A appreciate the info even though there's nothing I'm interested in.
---
It will probably not work. Chests system is fully capable of knowing what it owes you. Mainly because it was introduced 1 year after release, so it had to know all the chests it had to grant you and distributed them one at a time (1 chest/day). Also everytime someone loses credit for gw1 HoM AP and logs into gw1 to get it back (up to 500, so you cross a chest treshold no matter what) ... at this point if those people got double AP chests we'd know about it.
---
Again to the defenders, _I literally finished the episode before I finished my beer._
---
Comedy gold
---
Etheri you don't even play on FSP so won't have a clue.
---
The four main guilds on FSP currently - SOT, Kale, NUKE, RT - all play for fights.
---
BTW, Bez told me last night that WSR lost a bunch of players because T1 is boring...
---
This sub is tiring, ngl.
---
ArenaNet forgot they are making a game. Instead, they focus on dialogues and music, as if it was the most important thing to promote. It's mindblowing how clueless this company is after 15 years on the market.
---

---
I haven’t played in a long bit but it’s still a thing and the rotation is still braindead. You and the guy you reposed to should both kick yourselves
---
I was just wishing the same thing last night. I’m ok with long events as long as it’s partly interesting. Like DS - it’s long af but it’s broken up enough. 12 mins of the extract same few mobs is tedious. I’m happy they have drops and I get xp but yeah... not a meta I’m thrilled to do over and over.      
---
I do really like the end where we have a big icy boi and then all race up to a previously closed off part of the map for more bosses and more loots. And the ice mechanic is a nice touch - adds an extra thing to think about as the meta progresses.
---
Why are you raiding and not using voice?!
---
"just leave our game"
---
I heard deso BT gained a bunch of wsr players... suspicious how quickly they are "bored".
---
Nope. You just get one key.
---
The problem in my opinion is that this sub is usually overly critical. If I would to only read the sub and not play the game I'd think the game is utter crap with barely anything good in it.
---
haven't we been drowning in gw2 doomsdayer posts? I don't post myself but the level its reached is like when dozens of different art used to get posted everyday for karma farming.
---
You know someones starting shit when you see the bird meme.
---
i'm sure it's strike mission counterpart will be fun ;)
---
This was so confusing! I honestly have no idea how this mastery line is supposed to work. I mean, I got it all done but... still really unsure about the charged up skills and the orbs and why I can open chests without charging.
---
Did you find the book aswell? Was in there 2 times and found nothing..
---
Dulfy where are you! T. T
---
XDDDDDD DDDDDDD
---
Yeah. The model was great, but it should have been used differently. like have it stalk you for the whole season, and jump out when you least expect it.
---
Oddly enough they are still accounted (even if they lost their checkmark) for  the meta achievement.
---
I expected it too. I just figured something went weird with it in production and they couldn’t fix it in time. It’s ok, I’d rather have content when they promise it, then have it delayed for a while just for one little cut scene. The svanir puppet was incredible and I enjoyed that enough to make up for the fact our PC wasn’t in there. Like damn was that creepy - I freaking loved it.
---
Well, we can actually call this water, fire and grass. That's a good point.
---
Also, I don't like this masteries. They are indeed too flashy.
---
AI and NPCs are friendlier than humans. Humans too toxic.
---
now this is the quality content I sub for
---
They should add legendary 40-slot bags, keep 32 and 40 slot ones account bound, and make all other bags except 32 and 40 slot ones tradable.
---
&gt;you aren't helping
---
And you are?
---
I would not be surprised if much of the lag was caused by TP bots and TP watch scripts used by TP barons no longer working.
---
I saw this dude too! Happened at night in the map and was kinda freaky, he was just standing there.
---
Hmm, weird, I'm getting 3. Try making a ticket.
---
[It's fairly simple.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFkAAvDkj9k)
---
maintenance mode confirmed
---
It may have been like that initially, then decided to not require the charge, but didn't update the tutorial.
---
They should change to tutorial to open the chest first, then charge the red bull, then attack the dummy.
---
It was a pug group so DPS was not ideal. We didn't even make the cut for silver. The 20min includes both tries, strategy talk and wait time for the instance to fill. We ended up fighting them separately most of the fight as well as they didnt seem to want to stack. I'm hoping the other Strike bosses will be better.
---
It's the true embodiment of GW2 fashion wars: gemstore fashion wars (outfit edition).
---
I totally agree its time to make those old 24 and 28 bags account bound instead of being soulbound.
---
this has been one of the things that annoyed me the most with the Templates update. I got bag slots and made a lot of 24 and 28 bags to store all my gear. now with templates I have a lot less gear to store on some of my characters. Now would be the perfect time to put some of those 24 and 28 slot bags on character with 15-20 slot bags that I dont too much, yet I cant due to the bags being soulbound.
---
It is the point. Correct. Don't know where you are going with this reply.
---
I'm sorry but how does that answer my question. I didn't ask why people are mad as if it was a big mystery. I asked why do people feel the need to bitch at those that are happy with the game?
---
Hmm seems that it'll cover Drakkar Lake, can't wait!
---
this. whoever is working on fractals (new ones, reworks, and instability rework) since... basically PoF seriously needs to take a step back and consider their choices. it is sad that fractals seem neglected, it is even worse that many people actively playing the content are afraid to ask for updates due to the last few.
---
Gw2 meta rarely changes due to a lack of impactful balance changes.
---
Also: https://www.alienwarearena.com/ucf/show/2097403/boards/contest-and-giveaways-global/Giveaway/guild-wars-2-icebrood-saga-heros-bundle-key-giveaway
---
Same here.
---
Don't act like you speak for "long time vets". I and several people that I play with have been playing since the beta weekends coming from GW1, and we still play and still enjoy the game very much.
---
Just because you don't enjoy what you have available to do, doesn't mean there isn't a ton of things to do in the game that you haven't done to log in and play for. Even someone like WoodenPotatoes still streams the game constantly 7 years in without running out of things to do. Even with his current aim at doing/getting literally everything in the game with TONS of help from the community he's still nowhere near done with everything. So forgive me if I make the very safe assumption that you aren't out of things to do in the game, but rather you just want to do specific things and there isn't enough of the specific things that *you personally* care about.
---
The meta feels like they just added it because they felt it was necessary to have a meta on a new map.
---
I’ve read people’s replies to you.  They have not only adequately explained the “why” but you continue to disregard what they’re saying.
---
...but you don’t *actually* care, do you?  The reason behind people’s displeasure is clear has been eloquently and cogently stated.
---
cAn I hAvE uR sTuFf
---
Not sure if I should shame you for being a leech or praise you for understanding maximum leeching is the gw2 way.
---
It's sad this is how it is, but at least openworld is designed to enable it.
---
So much this, honestly I'm so surprised by this, not only isn't this whole meta anything new it's actually a rehash of a bunch of other "tower defense" modes, hell teq battery defense is 10x more real feeling than this. I feel so bad shitting on this content but it's like they just put in such low effort and low creativity.
---
It may just very well be a case of players migrating to the stronger server if you were being steamrolled by Deso...
---
Or it may even be a case of the environment on WSR getting a bit too toxic that people wanted a change, but still wanted to be with a winning server...
---
i think that is funny,how ppl think that STRIKE MISSIONS are good,when we dont even know what are rewards :D as far as i know,they drop same weapons as karma merchant.
---
sry for last 5 ppl,which still playing for fun.
---
Since we already know that the map will expand and that episode 2 will be closely tied in with episode 1, it’s not wrong to look at this as perhaps half of a normal release. But then again, they already said they wanted to have more consistent releases without always making a new map, so perhaps this will all feel better in Episode 2.
---
Personally I am enjoying the map so far
---
thats acutally true, i was also suprised about this. but overall, i've never seen so many mastery rank 295+ people die so frequently than in this meta... glassy builds payback lol.
---
If its going to happen with episode 2 in 2-4 months from now then that doesn't really change the fact that for a single release this was ridiculously small.
---
The map we got (and the map we will get) are both still embarassingly tiny.
---
The fact that they're part of the same map instead of two seperate maps doesn't change the fact that the individual releases are content starved. 
---
The end result is still 2 hillariously tiny releases.
---
People in the fan subreddit getting annoyed at all the negative degenerates that plague the place? *surprised pikachu*
---
Actually I just ask why they keep slamming a door on their foot over and over again expecting different results? If I don't like a game I just uninstall and move on because it's just something for fun. You shouldn't be getting angry over it, but everyone takes that as a personal attack. Like what do you expect for us all to comfort you or join in on your hate?
---
The map we got (and the map we will get whenever episode 2 drops) are both still embarassingly tiny.
---
Like what difference does it make having 2 tiny maps in 2 seperate releases, and having 1 normal sized map in 2 seperate releases? 
---
Almorra died alone, but died on her own terms. 
---
She deserved at least that.
---
It's exhausting I wish these people would fuck off into the ocean and never come back
---
Like what difference does it make having 2 tiny content starved maps in 2 seperate releases, and having 1 normal sized map in 2 seperate releases? 
---
Considering there were rumors around 2 years ago that "a Shivepraks expansion was in the works" ANET changed it into a LW Saga, then this is pretty much it. We will get different new types of content and mechanics with the upcoming episodes.
---
it acutally reminded me of that one character from "overlord" - pandora's actor was the name i think
---
WTF, everyone loves Taimi !
---
Thank you so much for your insight, lead story designer from Anet.
---
I love everything about this episode, from the zone, the feelings and vibes it gives off, to the whispers practically everyone is influenced by, like the evidence collector getting influenced by her dolyak, all the way to the Icebrood Colossus and the Boneskinner. But this part? The one where Jormag reanimates the body of his(her?) Fraenir only for the body to crook about like a marionette.
---
Absolute goosebumps. I love it everything about it.
---
You're absolutely right in terms of where this is heading. What Jormag says makes perfect sense, honestly. Maybe an alliance is indeed the best way to go about it. At least for a while. But to trust that thing would be absolutely foolish given how intelligent and cunning Jormag is. I doubt we could persuade it to become a permanent ally akin to Aurene. It'd backstab us long before that would ever come to pass.
---
There's never been an Elder Dragon who ceased its conquest voluntarily, right?
---
That's largely because the positives are mostly the things that have been in the game for a long time. They've been discussed to death. The subreddit doesn't represent the game as a whole, merely the recent additions. Maybe that's unfair, but it's also true that many prospective players would want to be sure of the health of the game moving forward, rather than just having a lot of content to play now.
---
I dont play on wsr. 
---
A lot of people dont like toxicity, and want to be on a winning server. But it's this behavior that promotes being toxic if you're a strong server. 
---
The problem is many of them WANT a friendly server that wins a lot, but they don't help create that environment. 
---
They suck donkeyballs and expect someone to hold their hand, praise them and carry them all at the same time. Nobody wants to be told how to use their skills better or die less! They want to be told they're amazing and get many lootbag wohoo!
---
That's why you should be toxic if you want a winning server. It wont help you get rid of all the leeches, but itll thin them out. And any server that wins consistently will have an infinite supply of players, weeding out the worst apples is good for the server. Less queues, less leeches, better standard overall.
---
And toxicity is your only tool for this. You should be nice to the players you want to keep of course, but good players that are valuable to a server are treated friendly even on "toxic" servers.
---
Itd be nicer if anet provided healthy tools for server management but they will not.
---
Speaking of this meta, do the floating orange "bombs" that can be dragged with skyscale actually do something when released?
---
Mordremoth controlled people.
---
Sylvari who turned mordrem guard were still alive and conscious inside. And all the mordrem clones were directly controlled by Mordremoth's hive mind. 
---
Jormag does something different. It's as if rather than getting your mind controlled, your soul gets replaced by the dragon's power. The kodan are very clear on this, those corrupted by Jormag cannot be restored. They are gone for good.
---
I suspect Jormag can slowly consume the souls of the living while they are still alive, and once there's nothing left of the original soul, they turn into icebrood.
---
If you say so, FF14 couldn't manage to keep my interest if it stabbed me with a rusty knife. Let's face it, Guild Wars 2 just has the best delivery method. I always lose the story of other MMOs between slamming the quest button and mashing through the dialogue so I can go kill 50 (insert generic mob here) for the 100th time.
---
&gt;The community on this sub is doing just as much damage to the game as Anet is, if not more.
---
yeah lmao the community calling out anet's bullshit is equally responsible for anet killing off 90% of the gamemodes and releasing sporadic hour long content drops every 4 months.
---
&gt; I dont play anymore. So my 'advice' is invalid.
---
FTFY
---
OK GWoomer. 
---
Imagine getting your posts, where you REEEEEE about toxicity, removed for being too toxic all day long.
---
Yeah it was hard to miss. It’s in the library and you need to finish the raven papers achievement from the first instance.
---
Sweetie, Drawback isn't even on gandara and hasn't been for months. Also not very nice to shittalk people behind their backs.
---
&gt;The idea that the playerbase should stop voicing their very real and very justified concerns
---
I think this is a bit of strawman. There's nothing wrong with voicing concerns about the game (I played the new episode last night and was pretty disappointed myself), but it seems like there's a lot of counterproductive negativity. Last week I saw a new player post about how much they were enjoying the game and it got flooded with people being like "I used to feel like this but now it sucks" or "Give it a week, you'll get bored". Criticism is one thing, but actively driving away new players is just stupid.
---
Something can be good despite having shitty rewards.
---
Well, I didn't have to pay for it and it gives me something new to do, so am pretty much ok with it.  I am only disappointed because I expected a little more, but with no cash needed I will take what I get.
---
I love this sort of completely braindead rhetoric. If people leave this game, that is multiplayer at core, it will eventually have to shut down. So they're encouraging the death of the game by saying "JUST DON'T PLAY IT!".
---
Personally, some months after PoF I realized GW2 isn't this "forever game" or home for lots of people, myself included. It's more like this vacation place that I visit every now and then.
---
I played the hell out of it already, I had never gotten this kind of dollar per hour enjoyed from any other game, thousands of hours.
---
I log in now to enjoy the bits of new content it offers, play some pvp matches every now and then, pug some training raid just to see how excited some players get out of their first VG kill, I also healscourged a strike team that had wiped twice before me joining because they weren't paying attention to the mechanics.
---
The joy I find in being a veteran is I get to open this door and show some people this amazing game I went through years ago, smiling as they complete achievements (recently my guild got a surge of new players to the game)
---
So I play this game just like my other games in my library, Overwatch , KF2, Destiny 2.
---
With all that said....could this game implement systems to make it's own content more appealing? Absolutely, like a dungeon roulette with a daily magnetite shards reward, or incentives to use LFG for raids (make mentoring an actual thing?), you can even have some of them in this roulette system after completing it X ammount of times, 2v2 queues, unify endgame currency for all level 80 content (pve at least?) All of that isn't new content, but I bet it would feel refreshing.
---
Remembering the debates about living story season 1, I can say it's always been like this. They're never gonna deliver content fast enough for the players to feel satisfied, it's how you know the players like your content. Plenty of content has been delivered since S1, especially in the form of expansions.
---
However, I still think that they went about this wrong way. The Gw1 style of expansions - or PoE2 seasons - and a bunch of other games - is far superior when it comes to game enjoyment, because you get something proper to bite into and explore. You don't really want to sit down and have a days content delivered every month (it's more these days, but I don't really keep up as much anymore), it doesn't drive immersion, once you're done it's back to the ol' grind. 
---
It does however drive MTX sales and their end line is what this is about.
---
I'm hoping to see a GW3 in the years to come.
---
90% of the time, if it looks cool it's Gemstore or you needed to grind GW1 for it.
---
Out of the 2, scepter will get you more dps. In terms of the meta, if you want to run scepter, [Condi chrono](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/condition/) is considered better than scepter mirage.
---
But in reality, unless you’re trying to push dps in raids, just play either weapon that feels the most fun to play for you. Scepter can feel a bit dull but powerful, while staff has some interesting mechanics. Axe will give you a crap ton of movement.
---
Also, if you’re planning on getting into raids or fractals, you’ll need to get used to always being in melee range, as stacking with your team is crucial.
---
I like it better on the end, I no longer open my mail on accident.
---
Their price will drop eventually, but not now. The new bags take ingots, which can't be just bought like the weapons. The wealthier people will keep buying the weapons (in order to unlock the recipes) and saving the ingots to craft the bags instead. It should remain as an opportunity to make some cash for at least a couple of weeks or months.
---
I think anet underestimates casuals, I think a main issue lies in the fact there is no in game advice for maximizing dps, and having a decent rotation for bosses. I think anet should have at least one easy dps rotation that does average damage for each class regardless of if patches hit and have it taught in game.
---
I'd like to see the reverse reddit meltdown this produces.
---
The game needs bosses which actually punish you if you ignore the mechanics. And rewards that are worthwhile if people adapt and overcome those mechanics.
---
It seemed like the bomb did massive chunk damage for the first couple minutes, but then stopped doing anything and only mobs hurt the shrine.
---
That being said, I *THINK* that instead of damaging the shrine, the bomb might slow down the "Gathered Raven Essence" that Shaman Weeabo is channeling--maybe?
---
Afair, some time ago Deroir said that he might quit. Responses were: who is this guy? Good riddance.
---
Then y'all wonder why people are leaving the game.
---
Literally unplayable
---
I've never found story immersive because of the disconnect between characters and gameplay. 
---
Everything is scary, world ending, super powerful... and yet it all barely does damage and dies to autoattacks.
---
The effects look impressive, but dont actually do much.
---
That's totally not true. Not only do communities vary widely from sub to sub, but so do the moderators. Anyone can make a sub and make the rules and moderation more strict on negativity etc, or even make it private. You could even just make a new GW2 sub. There are whole subs that are entirely just based around positivity in themselves lol.
---
They've said repeatedly they're treating the current map like Silverwastes and will add more to it with coming episodes
---
Yeah this is kinda where I'm at. I hate the constant negativity in the sub, but I can't deny being pretty disappointed when I finished the story episode last night. The first 10 minutes or so where you're exploring the keep was so cool, but then the rest of the story was basically walking simulator -&gt; 3 quick events -&gt; "puzzle" section -&gt; underwhelming boss fight. Not to mention that the map is noticeably smaller than previous releases. If ANet is trying to sell us on the idea that this "Saga" is going to be more significant than a typical LW season, then releasing a first episode with less content than the prologue isn't the best way to do it.
---
On a related note, have they said anything about the release schedule? I see a lot of people talking about the normal \~3 months, but is it possible that they're just planning on accelerating it?
---
Consciously or not, people blame those who enjoy content they view as sub par as the cause of that content's creation. Thus, knowingly or not, they lash out at those who express enjoyment for said content.
---
I'm sorry, where is the dishonesty supposed to be from Anet?
---
Not really. The content doesnt become more engaging or fun because you have the chance of a rare drop. Good drops only help with repeatability.
---
[deleted]
---
Those type of people sort of just defeat themselves, knowing what state the game is in, and what state the developer team is in.
---
Trust me dude, the people he is claiming post here bashing GW2 (my community) have very little interest in the game and have long since stopped logging in or have descended into the warm embrace of apathy.  
---
And the commentor doesn't like me very much so I'm not buying they watch me, especially as they have no idea what I actually think and say.
---
Agreed. But I'm just stating a fact that A-net advertised that saga will have more content than previous seasons. If they said "This is season 5, expect everything you expected for previous seasons", I would actually be fine with that. I enjoy every new thing they implement, but my expectations were increased with the infamous announcement in August, where they explicitly said: expansion level content! this is not it, that's my point. :)
---
Opening the essence chest is limited per account not per character so sadly after the first character it's less than that. The Norn chests which contain Ice Shards are per character though.
---
Not at the expense of everything else.
---
But what does the gathering even do? It is a timed event, there is no failstate as far as I have seen except losing the shrines maybe
---
Reworks can also be good. Swamp was awesome, Mai Trinn was decent, Snowblind and Cliffside really cut down on pointless parts on the fractals. People who did those are probably gone now though.
---
* S3 Tome - 6 Portal Scrolls
---
* S4 Tome - 7 Portal Scrolls
---
* S5 No Tome :( - 2 Portal Scrolls
---
It would be nice if they combined the Tomes so we can hop around to what seasons content we want without using 4 (current min required) slots.
---
Not a **OMG ANET FIX UR GAEM** problem, but just a nice QoL addition :)
---
Something fun like 100 or 99 cm?
---
Extremely boring, uninspired and could be a ton better as an actual fight.
---
Frustrating because it's so extremely boring and easy. It's a snoozefest where you're just waiting for adds to respawn.
---
so ... we are getting half a map now and the other half 2 months later ... exactly as OP described?
---
You are correct, they're capture zones. If a svanir stands in there and there is no player to counter them, the bar loses progress.
---
Really, targeting the bombers is pointless since you're rarely ever fighting inside the ring.
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
I'm looking forward to the day all the toxic haters and their inane, destructive criticism are gone.
---
I suppose they do make for perfect examples how not to get your point across nor your voice heard.
---
Like my aunt always used to say: "Be a shining example or a white elephant."
---
Yes, with actual fun bossfights.
---
That would work if the time between episodes would be smaller as well. And it **should** be, since they won't have to do a whole new map this time. 
---
We'll see how soon the next part arrives. **Should** be before the end of February max.
---
You must be new here. Game is in maintenance mode since few years now.
---
people should just let others enjoy the new content without playing the fun police... this sub used to be way more positive and constructive, but when the layoffs happened it just went downhill, at least it does seems that way, all I'm seeing on this sub, ever since the beginning of 2019, are cynical posts and comments repeating the same tired Gem Store joke over and over again...  
---
Don't get me wrong, I love cynical jokes, I'm generally the one who always make them just to poke fun at a situation, but seeing people repeating these same jokes almost on a daily basis made it loose its punch and meaning...  
---
It's a shame really to see this sub in this state... we used to be way less vitriolic and far more constructive.
---
Is Bound by Blood also included as Prologue?
---
Leveling wise, you basically have the Exp Share functionality that was introduced in Pokemon X/Y automatically, without an option to turn it off. That does generally mean your pokemon will be at the right levels without really any need of grinding, and you can more easily outlevel the general fights you'll have to do. Atleast, that has been my experience so far, and I'm at the 3rd gym.
---
Challenging fights can be found aplenty in the Wild Area, though. From what I hear especially the gigantamax raids in post game can get pretty rough.
---
I mean in gameplay we'll probably only encounter this one, and there will also be one as a boss in the Strike Mission, but lorewise we've actually helped another being start to change into a boneskinner...
---
 Your posts are false. You are claiming no communication when there clearly is communication. Ignoring that and just aiming for broad generalisations is how you get legitimate concerns (like those that myself and many others raise) ignored.
---
 
---
There are plenty of other games out there. Go and enjoy them and stop wasting time on something you no longer get enjoyment from. Your wellbeing will only improve.
---
&gt; Also, how do you know the next release is in 2 months?
---
It's an optimistic guess based on their promise of a smaller release cycle. I'd be a happier a gamer if it was less than 2 months.
---
Gotta to be there during Ursan way
---
IIRC they are scaled based on character's relative racial height. Imagine a charr character whose height slider was set to [--|--------] during character creation and asura whose height slider was set to [--------|--]. 
---
Asura will have a bigger raptor.
---
You forgot resource.
---
It's literally the biggest factors affecting the outcome of a project.
---
I am an audio engineer and I really appreciate good music and sound effects, and in some cases lack thereof. Remember the fight with Kralkatorrik in Thunderhead Keep? First all of the choir singing, then the epic music when you are walking towards the big room and talking to all your allies, and then the 10-15 min silence before the grand fight. I got goosebumps. Serious goosebumps.
---
And look at the lack of music in first instance of the new release: Silence. It literally has no music, just the sound of falling snow and wind. Brilliant, breathtaking, creepy. You FEEL alone. And the first instance was great, you walk into a GoT Castle Black type of keep, and you are alone, and you investigate. Brilliant. 
---
But after that it really becomes stagnant, boring, and underwhelming. This IS a game. Not a movie, not game of thrones. I appreciate good music, good storytelling, the feeling of being alone, being watched, but it IS a game. MMORPG, mind you. So it should have more to do then investigate, open doors and solve puzzles (although they were cool)
---
Did anyone else lose achievement progression for the light puzzles?
---
I have the Luminary achiev which is to finish all of the light puzzles, but the individual ones aren't marked as completed anymore while I did obviously complete them.
---
Are you dense or trolling?  I am not happy at all with how things have been getting done on anet's end, but it is not in maintenance mode and saying shit like that is just dumb.  Voice your issues, that is fine.  But spreading misinformation is bad for everyone all around.
---
&gt; So lets not get divided between casual vs. hardcore elitist, this release was subjectively pretty, enjoyable and fun, but underwhelming, short and lacking content, when comparing to releases that didn't advertise have "expac lvl content".
---
Amen.  I don't normally hunt achievements and I'm at 17/20 after about 2-3 hours a night the past 2-3 days.  That's kind of horrifying to me.  Other than the Strike Mission, there really isn't any content designed for more skilled players...?  Even then the Strike Mission is still super "free" for players that have cleared things like the Largos Twins. 
---
There's a lot of stuff that I liked in the new map in-terms of environment/art-design, story/lore, &amp; dialogue.  Unfortunately, it seems like it really was just 2-3 days worth of achievements and content unless I do the entire Boreal weapon collection.  Truthfully, I'd just rather play the original Guild Wars, Path of Exile or browse reddit while streaming Netflix or Prime.
---
Whining, yes. But there's also a lot of higher effort critique as well. All the "game sucks" with no explanation posts should be removed I agree, but if someone has an argument of why something can be better then that's a point of discussion. 
---
Game discussion died down years ago when communities filtered into their own bubbles, as reddit wasn't really interested in anything but fluff or rage. But also now there's very few content creators and very little new content to talk about, so the few posts we do see are fluff and rage. If the game doesn't have anything else to discuss then that's where the sub is gonna be.
---
Is this the achievement that unlocks the Home Instance Node for you to purchase?
---
The ice mechanic bugs me so much on the big boi stage - there are no shrines near enough to participate without going out of the way too much for the shield.
---
Bound by Blood is basically Prologue. Not sure what you mean.
---
Without getting too deep into spoilers, this chapter was the one that had to deal with something about Jormag that the player already learned from a trailer months ago. It's probably kinda hard to write a story chapter where the central reveal is already known to the audience, but the characters still have to react to it.
---
I got the sense that the story was short and low-impact too. I'm not sure if it actually *was* short, but it was very light on actual gameplay until the very end of the last mission.
---
But all that being said, I'd describe most of the release as "fine," and I'm still pretty interested in the direction the game is going.
---
Had they changed the client, that_shaman would have told us I think :). Also this button shenanigan would only be necessary if they want to keep both clients ingame for some reason. In the past they changed the client without changing the button (they changed both the browser addon used to access the tp, and remade the tp itself)
---
They said they’d have smaller but more frequent updates but I didn’t expect **THIS** little content. I’m happy with what we got tho
---
I'm wondering if the final cutscene of the Key of Adhashim raid might become relevant in the future?
---
meanwhile, most people stand in the middle and act civilized while the other extreme groups are going at each other...
---
If you're pessimistic enough, you can explain any form of gameplay in any game to such a meaningless statement!
---
If December is Wintersday and Lunar New Year is at the end of January/early february, then January I think is the nest month to release. It's two months away so you still have the two month release pattern, and I think it's important to stay consistent on releases right now
---
I think your expectations are way too high tbh.
---
100+ seconds trying to FIND the boss. Two people...
---
Yeah i'm probably stupid and blind, and can't play videogames. That must be it, i just don't get the depth and finesse of gw2 encounters... Btw boss would die un 5 seconds flat if it wasnt for teleports/invuln but i guess thats also part of the *excelent* encounter design right?
---
Deepstone has 3 bosses btw. Problem with that one is that it's too easy and theres the stupid pit puzzle.
---
No need to get personal. It's just a post, it won't hurt you.
---
I can't think of many games where the endgame can be described as that shallow, no
---
It's the truth though.
---
But it is a dead game and in maintenance mode.
---
I thought was VM from SW rehash backwards... just replaced the escort of bombs with stopping the bombs.
---
Exactly. The community outside this sub, and actually playing the game is fantastic. The handful of vitriolic trolls in this sub seem to think they hold a majority opinion, yet this sub is the only place those hyperbolic feelings about the game seem to pop up.
---
And I don't mean constructive criticism. That's totally normal and acceptable.
---
And do you think that actively driving new players and positive players away is going to increase Anet's ability to improve the game?
---
How is literally any of that going against what I said? All of that is of less importance to the game than the game itself. And you can find more games than ever by people who make them purely because they are passionate about them, just not in the AAA world.
---
Or not be a spaz and stop using metabattle
---
Sometimes I just hate what the Internet did to people like me with opinions
---
No problem here, wanted to make snarky remark on state of instanced pve in this game.
---
I just think of this: [https://i.imgur.com/3fD44Gv.png](https://i.imgur.com/3fD44Gv.png)
---
Let's see, take a pokemon game. You beat the story of the game, what do you do then? You train new pokemon, you catch pokemon you don't have yet, you level them up, you breed a pokemon to be competetive, and you either go do multiplayer battles or try to go for a record run on the Battle Tower. If you get bored of that, you do the exact same thing with other pokemon, and you repeat that ad infinitum.
---
Or a new game like Borderlands 3. After you finish the story, the things you do mostly boil down to finishing up the sidequests you didn't do, level up till max level, try out maniac mode, and grind the perfect gear by repeatingly doing the content you already did. Or do it all again in Vault Hunter mode.
---
Now it's your turn, show me some examples that -can't- be boiled down to "6 gameplay loops without any challenge".
---
That is true. But you started the argument with the AAA examples so I'm sticking to it.
---
Molten boss rework is extremely bad. Nothing but a long corridor with same enemy types that have "mechanics" that no has even noticed. And the final boss was barely touched except the 50% add spawns. The boss itself could've been more  interesting than that. What if at 50% they switch their transformation no more having to decide "which one do you want to to kill first" Also the lighting was changed for no damn reason.
---
Didn't they change the black lion icon? This looks like the old one unless I'm mistaken.
---
Good thing a discussion never moves beyond the initial statement then right?
---
nagennif is well known fanboy. On reddit and official forums. I don't trust his opinion.
---
Pop a mentor tag and make a party on LFG. There's bounty boards in some part of the map where you can see if the boss can be spawned and it shows you the exact location of the boss.
---
It could use having less clutter enemies and more active fights.
---
I'd go with these changes:
---
* Change the layout of the fractal into mainly 4 platforms without much between them. 
---
 * Initial starting platform.
---
 * First boss fight
---
 * Second boss fight. 
---
 * Jade Maw fight.
---
* At the first two bosses, block the path forward with jade walls that break and fall around the platform, forming a spiral down to the next platform. No enemies between platforms, just some critters for the crab achievement.  At the end of the boss fight, it would be possible to backtrack all the way to the start, letting people who stay at the end of a T1 recommended complete the critter achievement in their own time. 
---
* The first and second boss would have mechanics that are repeated later at the last boss.  
---
 * The first boss would be a jade-colored hermit crab with a jade shell that drops shards of its shell when attacked, and the shards have to be used in some of its mechanics to defeat it.
---
 * In CM, the first boss would be replaced by large jade elemental that also drops jade shards when attacked and has similar core mechanics with some added attacks.  
---
 * The second boss would be a giant Jade-colored Irukandji. The model would be fixed to look like jellyfish like in GW1 rather than GW2's wind riders. 
---
 * In CM the boss would be a pitch black giant skelk with a shadowy effect and jade bioluminescense, called something like "Jade Nightmare".
---
* Move the Jade Maw platform down to the surface of the water. Give it more of an 'ocean in space' feel, kind of like the bifrost in marvel movies. The sky would still look the same, a clear starry sky, but on the surface of the water. The water will look pitch back and reflect the sky. Entering the water would cause Agony, but it would give time to jump back into the jade for anyone with enough AR. The water would also be filled with Irukandji that can do massive damage. The model of Irukandji would be fixed to look more like other jellyfish rather than wind riders. 
---
 * During the fight, there would be more varied mechanics and repeated mechanics from the previous fights instead the colossi and the tentacles.  There would be still tentacles, but they would be part of a mechanic rather than just health to take down.
---
 * In CM, the Jade Maw is killed and replaced by a "Legendary Shadow of Kanaxai" that appears as the last player steps into the platform. The overall mechanics will be similar, but instead tentacles it will summon pillars of jade, and it'll have trickier extra attacks.
---
New rewards: 
---
* At he end of the fight, the waters around and under the last platform will become clearer and will only cause Agony damage far from the platform, letting rangers dive in and charm a Juvenile Irukandji. A green jellyfish pet that uses [Poisoning Whirl](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Poisoning_Whirl).
---
* Ebb, Flow and Jade Weapon skins will have a very small chance to drop from the jade Maw, and a bit less small chance to drop from CM bosses, once a day.
---
* The Bling vendor will sell a Jade Creature tonic that gives forms of jade-colored creatures and a Nightmare Combat tonic that transforms into the Shadow of Kanaxai.  
---
* The Shadow of Kanaxai boss will have a chance to drop a Jade infusion that changes the character skin, and and a Shadow infusion that engulfs the character in a faint shadow mist and leaves dark trails like those left my Shades and Aatxes.
---
Why not just pug i dont see how getting 5 more people is some incredible time sink
---
I'm not arguing there are passionates outside of AAA environment. Since we agree on this there's nothing to discuss.
---
I just got a key. Are you maybe looking at their eu site and it is different?
---
I only remember the feeling of "That's it?" after it expanded. Because I DO love the idea in general as it has a lot of potential, but so far the GW2 implementation has been underwhelming. Episode 2 might knock my socks off, what do I know, but Dry Top still kinda rankles. The sandstorm mechanic was not a bad idea though, at least on paper. Can be great fun - IF enough players are on the map.
---
At least the player response to Drooburt's fate was hilarious. I still wonder if there's any published data of how much gold was sunk into that little quaggan (before he started giving something in return)...
---
 I agree, I'm just here to play the game and enjoy myself.  I get disappointed when Anet does something I don't like, but I try not to let it ruin what's there.
---
Yep. The defend event either should be shortened to like 5 min or have an option created that allows it to be completed faster.
---
Who are you? Who posted the thing you're referencing? Why didn't you link the actual source? Why would we trust your opinion?
---
But you are disregarding something.
---
How many people actually did uninstall/don't play, but comment here, because they love the fundamentals of the game(like combat system, that shines in pvp environment)?
---
I would love to play this game, but it's unenjoyable as thing currently stand. Hence i will voice my opinion and regard someone that doesn't agree with this as factually wrong as wrong as we regard flat-earthers to be.
---
I implied that it's very easy to read the boss not that you are bad at video games, not everyone tries to insult you on the internet.
---
Loved it!!!!
---
Precisely. I would like to add that as a new scourge I could confidently say you should NEVER use your F1 (Placing your shades). Only when you get much more experienced and switch to a hybrid build (available on Metabattle) or start to kite on Sabetha, would be the only time you should start using it. But until then forget your profession mechanic exists (sadly).
---
" Your posts are false. You are claiming no communication when there clearly is communication. Ignoring that and just aiming for broad generalisations is how you get legitimate concerns (like those that myself and many others raise) ignored. "
---
LOL, can you wake up already? 5 to 8 responses in a forum that has thousands of neglected posts is not real communication
---
A new dev telling us several times "i'm checking that already" or giving some insight on his own thoughts about balance is not real communication
---
you know why? because after they tell us that bs, later they ignore all the feedback we give with proper posts well written and with no sarcasm or attacks towards anet, full of "legitimate concerns" and they do whatever the fuck they want
---
do you need examples? after they released mounts, they were thousands of post asking for them not to add them to wvw, after they presented the mount, **we didn't want**, in that stream, thousands of posts asking them to remove stuff like the extra hp, or one dodge, or even add a dismount skill, what did anet do? whatever the fuck they wanted several weeks later we got a completely op mount ruining the game mode, and it took them six months to add the dismount skill, and nerf a bit the health (a bit when players with "legitimate concerns" asked for them to reduce it to 1k or 2k hp so we wouldn't even need dismount skills)
---
more examples? check out mesmer subforum and see how much they ignored chrono feedback, before and after they destroyed the spec anyway out of nowhere, people to this day are complaining and making polls to take all back of that shit they call "rework"... and how did anet communicate to us concerned about chrono state of play? ignoring us... great!
---
and i could give even more examples but this post is getting kind of long and i don't really think you actually care given you barely read less than half of what i wrote, but if you do i'd happily make a brief list
---
" There are plenty of other games out there. Go and enjoy them and stop wasting time on something you no longer get enjoyment from. Your wellbeing will only improve. "
---
As i already told you i left the game a while back and moved to ESO,  i prefer to choose myself tho where do i waste my time, thank you very much
---
But why wouldn't you cause damage, until they change direction for the better?
---
Why is it stupid? I don't get anything because someone joined the game? I might get something if i scare him away though
---
I don't know why people stick around to complain. Come play ESO, we got talking cats.
---

---
&gt; I might get something if i scare him away though
---
A declining player base and ultimately a dead game?
---
Why are you on reddit then? lol
---
Ok bro, i'm telling u we were two people. We do raids and (cm) fractals. I guess we are both too dumb to do a story mode boss, it's 100% not possible it glitched, anet is just too good at programming.
---
Also i was probably hallucinating on the last door not opening and then doing it without me clicking anything.
---
So strikes don't exist, and releasing something when it's done rather than with a chapter means it doesn't indicate the direction of things, and loadouts don't count because you think they happened later than they should have.
---
Do you know you're just making excuses to be angry about the saga?
---
Honestly thought this was a shit-tier meme from r/DestinyTheGame
---
Crazy how most games are similar.
---
Liking something or not is a subjective opinion and has nothing in common with disregarding objective fact.
---
Maybe you were, works on my machine.
---
Well GW3 maybe or a change in direction that will be something more than open world story releases...
---
We'll definitely have to try that out.
---
What is objective fact here?
---
Clearly you want to waste your time ranting to me about something you apparently don't care about now. If you enjoy it, fair enough but I'm not engaging any further with someone that just wants to froth (I did actually read your post, I'm still waiting to find out how you haven't in fact moved the goal posts...).
---
Your problem is that you believe your viewpoint is universal and that every little issue deserves a response. That isn't how companies work. If you look at the ESO forums, you'll also see that isn't how it works over there.
---
Thanks for the heads up!
---
I got the stuff, its my first mini pet and the 10 slot bag replaced the 8 slot bag i had from before.
---
I got 2x 10 and 1x 12 slot i got from story and leveling up .
---
I liked it too!
---
I wonder if Aurene and Jormag can just have a little chat, hash everything over Elder to Elder?
---
The old Lion got sent back to Metro Goldwyn Mayer because it turned against its feeding hand. Now we have a new one called Derpy, which is the most followed Lion on Instagram. Its most important feat, the one that made it the runner up, is zero dignity. 
---
Derpy loves endorsing Products, especially those 2000 gems Mount skins, and the 19999 gem male Lion skin for Angora cats.
---
So I haven't played Guildwars 2 since maybe 2015, but this game has been consistently updating and adding more content for almost 8 years. Most tv shows don't last that long. I'm not saying the content is great (honestly wouldnt know) but let's take a minute to appreciate ANet for keeping this game alive for us. It might not always be perfect but at least they havent left us in the cold with a dead outdated game. There's always the next patch. 
---
You can now continue your meme wars.
---
&gt; And then we ask "Why doesn't the Devs talk to us!" when we literally do it to them!
---
For some inexplicable reason, it is not the case in, for example, Path of Exile subreddit. 
---
Do you have an idea about why it could be?
---
Same. That's why I thoroughly enjoy mocking awful gameplay... it always delivers entertainment.
---
Angry players that come up with the most original arguments as to why they're secretly really good.
---
Who Is he? No idea really
---
&gt;The PVP scenario just needs context
---
Sorry when you said it just needs context I thought you meant it some kind of story context. My mistake.
---
&gt;Yeah, raids and fractals have small plots, but they are basically exposition presented and the quality tends to be really lol. 
---
Every time I ever ran with PUGs in dungeons storymode everyone just bitches at the people that don't skip cutscenes that provide story so I don't think most people who play those modes want a ton of story. They just want to fight bosses and get the shinies at the end.
---
It absolutely wouldn't be just as accurate lol. I agree that there are people that are like that on the positive side, but to suggest that the ratio of extremists on both sides are comparable in this sub is absolutely dishonest. The amount of people that respond overly negatively to a benign post/thread here and the amount of people that respond that way to reasonable critique is blatantly lopsided.
---
You don't get tons of people "reeing about entitlement" over someone saying something as reasonable as "It was a bit shorter than I was hoping" much, if at all. On the other hand, there are a bunch of vitriolic comments about how shit the game is in reply to a thread just showing the new launcher skin and "reeing" about how people are stupid for being happy about it... 
---
It's certainly nowhere near as balanced as you seem to be implying lol.
---
There are different way of coding a toolbar . If u do it the last way this is a solution. Sometimes the only solution
---
Most likely
---
Had to make a screenshot to read it :C
---
Killing GW2 is....not how you get GW3
---
Just wondering, do we have any confirmation that this switch was INTENDED by ANET?  
---
For all we know, they were just as surprised to see the icon move after the patch launched as we were.
---
Sadly, I'm not even trying to be sarcastic here....
---
It's as if the root of toxicity remains, and what left are people tired of dealing with symptoms.   
---
Cough.
---
Yeah i'm not sure if i should trust jormag or not...
---
On one hand she murdered almorra and our allies, corrupts everything in the marches and sends her minions to murder us too. 
---
Also everyone that listens to her whispers ends up dead or worse.
---
On the other hand... Ehhh... 
---
She promises to help against a nondescript enemy noone ever saw???
---
MAN ITS SUCH A HARD CALL!!!
---
New launcher tho guys
---
I thought I escaped the dota sub &gt;.&lt;
---
maybe you should, that's not a big barrier to entry
---
You want my crappy solo pve mace shield warrior build? FINE MAYBE I WILL
---
&gt;Stop crying and expecting all these things from an EPISODE of FREE CONTENT!
---
Why would anyone expect updates to WvW, PvP, Fractals, Raid Wings, or (ill add) Legendaries from an EPISODE of FREE CONTENT?
---
Maybe because outside of the expansions, all updates to WvW, PvP, Fractals, Raid Wings, or (ill add) Legendaries came in an EPISODE of FREE CONTENT?
---
You don't have to be a 4D Chess Master to figure this out....
---
Daed sub
---
I mean its a business, they had to continue it since unlike tv shows, networks have other shows to bank their money on. Arenanet tried that route and failed hence the lay offs... what a bad analogy.
---
I play on MacBook Pro from 2017 and I usually get 25-60 fps (depending on the area and number of other players around doing things). Only in Lion's Arch I drop to 15. That being said I have shadows, shades and post-processing set to minimum and the rest to max (anti-aliasing to fxxa). So it's not bad, but definitely not great.
---
&gt; best example of that look at Skyrim
---
here is where most of players are wrong, as in they treat this game (which is an MMO), as a single player. Anet tried to make it an MMO again with the initial release of Hot. Bad reviews and complaints from gaming media and casuals, respetively, turned it into a single player again.
---
Yeah....on top of that it's a braum story....the least popular character of the new team
---
I'm gonna blow your minds, guys.
---
The TP has a keybind! Usable by both humans and bots!
---
You should see a doctor about that cough. You might be allergic or worse.
---
I'm not up to date on the sub meta, but I checked after reading this thread and Dulfy hasn't posted for gw2 since April
---
That's my guess, too. I've also seen random times of the raven lens special action key pop up but can't seem to replicate it / never thought to actually hit it until too late. Ghosts and stuff on the map, too. Guessing that later Raven masteries will include seeing more visions of the past or something.
---
I've never understood that at all. The only MMO that I ever thought like that was Star Wars The Old Republic, which at release was pretty much a great single-player game with some online components attached. I really liked how the character wasn't the main hero in HoT. I thought it was so refreshing to see a game do that. I don't mind being the hero, but it shouldn't be something you shoehorn into something where it doesn't make sense. The hero can arrive late to the party and suffer the consequences.
---
Well considering this was the debut of their SAGA and supposed to show us what the new lean mean trimmed down Anet can do it pretty disheartening. The tone was great but dear god was the content phoned in and lacking, the vast majority of the story was breadcrumb oriented and the final boss had almost zero impact since they spent almost zero time helping us establish a bond. Hell the map itself is pretty but the final meta is frightening bad, it's a terrible tower/lane defense that has been done about 10x before better in different parts of the game.  
---
I mean I'm not trying to negative but it's hard not to be when so SO much of this content is short and done before and uncreative.
---
Definitely in agreement with this along with make the space bigger. It's odd because on this map we have two whole sections, the raven sanctum and the top section, which only serve one purpose each and aren't really part of the main regular exploration, yet they couldn't give the forest that treatment and had to pack it with filler events that make it feel less ominous and more of the same old mob spank train stuff.
---
I'd just really like that MMO experience of being able to explore vast spaces without it being over filled with mobs and conflict, except for at specific moments perhaps. GW2 is a beautiful game that could serve this fantasy, but Anet is just really bad at communicating what players should and shouldn't expect from them, so they won't do something risky and stand by it.
---
It does appear in story briefly.
---
I like at home more
---
# Maybe they should not have said we'd get "_Expansion Level Content_" with this shit then.
---
GW2 is a game developed by the same studio as GW2, and despite "technical challenges", templates were available during GW1 reign, and ANET was able to deliver them in GW2 as well in a limited form of pvp/wvw/pve loadouts, to later swap it into this weird monstrosity they charge money for.   
---
It's a good comparison, because both games are made by the same studio, both had templates (gw1 and gw2 wvw/pvp/pve loadouts switching).
---
i find the new map is really handy for getting more of the season 4 map currencies cause the conversion rate is pretty good. I'm up to the saddle part of the skyscale and it was a big help with getting them. I'll probably be able to finish up all i need this weekend now.
---
That being said it felt like the prologue was a much bigger patch then this tbh.
---
In the same way that a TV show is fun
---
Shadowbringers, Shadowlands... Shadows of Cantha confirmed.
---
Nah just some people getting worked up over a game they don't even play. I wouldn't call shittalking people online without their knowledge enjoyable. Sorry. I hope you can find a way to enjoy life without trying to hurt others &lt;3
---
The forest itself is also a bummer to me. You don't serve ominous if you pack it with mobs and events to spank and leave. It's also pretty small. I really hoped for a large dark forest area like in snowblind fractal, but probably even bigger with more incentive to traverse it for a long time. I wanted the space to be too chilly for a mount and have that function where we'd have to go to flames to avoid it (maybe involve the Koda mastery from S3). 
---
It's possible that with the Raven Sanctum and Asgeirs thing they didn't want a 3rd part of the map to also be devoted to just one thing so they filled it with more events, but it really means they under-delivered on one of the things they really highlighted in the announcement.
---
Well, guess im grinding big bags finally
---
Nevermind the fact I *also* love this game which is the reason I bother to type up complaints in the first place
---
&gt;Mai Trinn was decent
---
Makeing battle more spammy with enemies is decent to you XD
---
Instead they could give Horik meaning beside shield and make fight harder rather than spamier but, I have seen enough of they reworks, no more. Auntie Mei, Molten, Furnance or Aquatic shows exactly why they should not rework, they don't have a clue how to do it, and only making it worse than it was.
---
Yes, it attacks their bottom line
---
The new one's better. Evon is expressing his soft side just a little bit.
---
I totally agree that it would be awesome, and that it's a shame that it didn't stick. However, it's pretty understandable once you get into the logistics of that. Maybe if they had a much bigger budget and company they could pull that off, but it just would take way too much time and money to write, design, and voice act for in an MMO I think. They already have to do 10 versions of every player voice acting just for having 2 genders and 5 races. They wouldn't be able to go all that far with it either even if they had the means, since we're in one shared MMO world where things have to fit together with what other players did. Unlike a single player game, where everyone can branch way out in their own story without having to worry about that causing issues and contradictions in the world/characters for other players who make different decisions.
---
Yes, that means it will take 1 slot and we will get Prologue + 6 episodes.
---
Its only been two days since the release and we are at full sail on the shit-posting.  What a time to be alive!
---
It's basically what every episode that isn't the finale is for.
---
It was the very first thing I noticed, that and its repositioning on the top bar. Moving the icon makes me irrationally angry.
---
I understand, and agree. I merely said that so I can illustrate that I would not have had the need to write this post (because I'm enjoying the game) unless I really feel Anet isn't delivering on what was advertised.
---
They decided to do the announcement. They said expac lvl content. My view is just that this isn't expac lvl content, far from it. Not complaining, criticizing, because I care for the game. :)
---
Is there an invisible bag version?
---
I know a guy who paid $15 for one of the Quiznos codes. Sucks to be impatient.
---
And yet I still enjoyed it.
---
You can sometimes find bounty train groups on LFG, so that's an option.  You can also ask in map chat for help.  If you mention it's for the beetle mount, other people working on the collection may be interested in helping with it.  I'd also suggest joining a guild, cuz other than being a lot of fun and a great way to interact with other players, they're usually willing to help with things like this.
---
Somebody needs to photoshop 4 more of those things next to the icebrood
---
The true end game for the.. game.
---
My friend bought a cookie at Quiznos and asked for more than one code. They handed him a stack. He sold a bunch of them to people on EU who were willing to give him ingame items mostly, though a couple people paid as much as $15 for the codes.
---
One of them is now bitching in Discord about how the Quiznos code is better because it also included a discount on purchasing the game, and he's still upset because its US-exclusive.
---
“why do people keep saying that the game is dying??”
---
IF you neeed a 10 slot bag then you had no choice but get that code :D
---
C A M E R A S H A K E I S T O T A L Y G R O S S 
---
sorry.
---
&gt; When I used to read complaints about "no hardcore content", I understood them, but they were not my concern.
---
Do you work for Anet?
---
Really though, your points are good and are truthful about the past few releases.  Its not horrible but its pretty rough.  Its not engaging really for anyone that doesn't thoroughly enjoy open world PvE.  Yeah, the concert in GV was a lot of fun, was new style of event, and genuinely felt like good content.  That's it though.  Its not something I'm going to repeat each day or even after the first day of release.  Its the same problem a lot of these new living story maps have, its not very repeatable.  If its not fun or the gold income isn't good, players won't do it.  Look at Silverwastes...people STILL go to that map to play it.  Its an engaging map with a good meta and gold making opportunity.  When you get more of the same and its all you get every 2-3 months, its hard to be excited.
---
just kick them when you reset the instance
---
Do you NEED a good comp for the new strikes? Legit asking, my only strike experience is the soloable frosty 2.0
---
Lol. I've had it on so long I never really notice it.
---
there's definetly a bug in the display at the very least.
---
after a friend told me about the reset and removed AP I checked for myself (didnt pay attention to it until it was mentioned to me)
---
The AP are internally still accounted for, redoing the puzzle(s) and changing map will also put the AP display back in order
---
I have to say I'm pretty disappointed with the meta in this map as well :( I think the premise itself is exciting and the foundation of the experience is solid, but the time and frequency of portals/mobs spawning just isn't fun, really. Not to mention Aesgir's legacy is a much more condensed area -- it's not as annoying as Dragonfall, but it also feels less exciting, idk. 
---
The shining parts of this map to me are the little things more than the big ones. It's weird. In terms of atmosphere it's probably my favorite but as far as substance it feels far less meaty than season 4's maps.
---
Yeah, I saying to friends that I definitely expect them to become shrine waypoints or portals in the next chapter. The placement of those things is too deliberate.
---
We’re /r/RuneScape now boys.
---
It's the opposite on this sub tho. No one is allowed the story even tho I can safely say everyone thought it was too short
---
This should really be its own post
---
&gt; IF you want to have some small, steady income of map specific material
---
Just as an example when they added the new skyscale mount you suddenly needed 250 of every LWS4 map currency. As someone who bought the nodes I had enough for most of the maps without actually playing on these maps. Though if you want to collect your nodes daily I suggest having an Unlimited Gathering Tool set on the character that you use.
---
heal warrior is shit just because they can't share strong boons ( protection, resistance, aegis, stability,etc) i'm a warrior main and have been playing around with heal warrior since start , it's only fun to troll with it, for actual gameplay, firebrand is simply superior
---
i hope this map works like drytop and maybe is able to be updated much sooner then normal since there isnt anything left to do.
---
Well, let's see what they do.
---
Firebrigade!
---
But the playable cat race in ESO has *tits*, and only two of them as well
---
Clearing the cache works for the majority (95%) of people. Calling me a liar just shows you are insecure about something because it didnt produce the same results
---
I don't deny that they might do more with the Boneskinner in the Strike Mission, but I don't see how mechanics like "throwing its voice"  to trick you, or "setting traps" for you falls into a strike mission specifically, either. The nature of the Boneskinner actively hunting you, making you feel like you "always need to look over your shoulder" as the developers said, suggests  to me it was meant to do a lot more in the *open world*, outside of the strike. Dunno how they'd make you feel constantly hunted in a strike when you kind of know what you're fighting already and where you won't need to be looking over your shoulder.
---
The language they used heavily insinuated they were discussing the overworld Boneskinner, not the strike one. That's a big reason I don't acknowledge the strike version Boneskinner at any rate, because the stuff they were talking about just wouldn't work in what amounts to - as you yourself say - a 10 man boss fight.
---
Hell, the Boneskinner they hyped up would work better as a *dungeon* boss than a strike mission boss. At least then you could believe it would actively stalk you through a location.
---
Their legs are the wrong legs too.
---
&gt; I'm just saying that when someone complains that's because he cares.
---
I'll just copy-paste my answer to other user:
---
Complaining about something doesn't automatically mean you care for the subject. Sometimes it is the case, sometimes it's not. You accused someone of simplifying while doing the very same thing.
---
&gt; Do you NEED a good comp for the new strikes?
---
You need either a decent comp, decent players, or the patience to keep trying after multiple wipes. Unlike the first strike, a random blob of PvE heroes can't wander in and clear it.
---
It is the place "Where the Raven can't fly"
---
Thanks for the response and I agree with you on points. I'd love to discuss this with you further later this evening because right now I'm at work and I just don't have the time to give this the proper response it deserves. Have my upvote in the meantime.
---
https://i.imgur.com/22Z5eJh.png
---
I guess they wanted to give it a campsite vibe for the horror story. Also they wanted to offer new assets with low efforts?
---
I'm not worked up. I just thoroughly enjoy it when shit groups pretend they're great and act all upset and hurt when called out on it. It's really a lovely part about GW2. 
---
Everyone has the right to claim and pretend they're really good players even when all evidence says they're not. 
---
i.e. I like how you'll use any arguments to defend yourself, other than actual arguments in favour of your gameplay. Not one argument or proof of decent gameplay. "We GvG'd this guild and won!" "Here's a video to show how we play nowadays, as you can see it's significantly better than randomly using our spells!". Nada! 
---
Instead, it's a flip flop between "you're so angry!" "you're a dick!" and "I really enjoy watching people be angry !!!!". That's the type of original arguments I'm talking about.
---
You could just state "yeah the gameplay isn't the best but we enjoy ourselves as a guild :)". That makes complete sense and is respectable. But instead I get /every/ argument possible to discredit the idea the gameplay might be bad... Without ever even mentioning the gameplay.
---
That's the type of original arguments I visit this sub for. "What you're saying hurts my feelings so it can't be true!" 
---
GW2 memes are certainly more entertaining to me than the gameplay the game is evolving towards. I suppose that might make me a dick; I can live with that. In fact, being a dick can result in better content than anything anet provides.
---
you know what bothers me the most? the mini icon and the icon in zhe window from the TP dont fit anymore...
---
Warrior Warhorn+shouts is still considered a meme build with a clunky spec line. No one uses it seriously.
---
it burnsssssssssss, my retinasssss &gt;:(
---
very good website, loads of information, very helpful, it is a good idea that you make it accessible for english speaking people. Bravo les gars, continuez comme ça !
---
This team also apparently can’t do adventures either. But I guess they made up for it by being the team that doesn’t hide 40 coins around the map to be collected for 6 AP
---
Yeah, I've got it turned off now for future videos. lol
---
When can I buy my memes from the gem store?
---
Thank you.  I’d be happy to discuss further.
---
Should we tell him?
---
lol
---
when i first played the meta i thought "wait we gotta do this for 10 minutes with no major phase changes?".  Serious head scratcher as to why some wrinkle couldn't be added to the defense portion of the meta if it was going to be that long with just the portals and the ice cover thing to be a hindrance.  
---
Split it up into a 3-x-3-x (15 min total limit) sequence with alternating objectives for defense like a more structured SB/Portal sequence.  Defend shrines from multiple bombers and their army of escorts for 3 minutes and then the portals spawn spewing out hordes of icebrood and svanir that try to make a b-line to the closest shrine in intervals.  Each portal is defended by some elite icebrood and scaling champs.  You have to destroy the elite/champ guards and then the portal in order to finish the phase.  Then when it's evident that bombs and portals won't break down the defense, the final phase starts and you have to bring down the colossus who also has his own army escorting him and some shielding him like those vinetenders from HoT.  "Ice fortifies. Ice protects".
---
Oh no - it can be on if you want! i don't mind! i just notice it and make a &gt;:( face.
---
Don't start with 28 stacks only
---
ez
---
Don’t think you need 30 stacks, just the full level 2 mastery for it.
---
There's a pylon when you enter the room - you can literally have 30 stacks in seconds, before the fight start - what are you talking about
---
1 good healer shoud keep you all alive,its not THAT hard.
---
I get what you're saying and it's true that the 3 strike missions are huge but considering there is little else to do yes. The story was incredibly short and there wasn't much gameplay attached to it despite walking and listening to what the NPCs have to say. The map is filled with few events but most and especially the meta are incredibly underwhelming. They can do so much better (prolog) and this is supossed to replace expansions so no I'm not happy with what they delivered.
---
I'll have to keep that in mind. Having never done a Strike Mission before I don't want to be "that guy" that messes it up.
---
still is retarded...
---
Let people have their fun, man. If this conversation has demonstrated anything, it's that there is an audience for strong narrative moments with minimal gameplay.
---
It's important to stay in the green unless you have a ton of confidence in your dodging abilities.  You basically have nearly unlimited dodges with powerful mistlock potions.
---
i actually like the sort of afk-style-fractal once in a while, i don't mind it! remove the crappy pirate one though, i'll be happy
---
You know what I really wish they'd done? You know the part of the story where you leave the Boneskinner den? That would've been a perfect opportunity to introduce it as a boss fight in the forest, one where you can't mount up. Imagine if the Boneskinner had been stalking your commander through the trees, darting in and out of the shadows. That was like the PERFECT moment to nail home just how terrifying a predator it is, yet they didn't do that. 
---
I feel like there's sections of the map that should've been utilized for at least a couple more solid sections of the personal story before the raven sanctum, and that's definitely one of them.
---
So how it does work? I will pick Bounty from the board and this creature will spawn at the same time? How many ppl do I need for a champion boss? Make the party first and then pic the Bounty?
---
I was planning on making a stand-alone post once the data for yesterday is available. The big comment and post spikes are usually for the wednesday after patchday, so as soon as the website is updated and the data available I'm gonna write up a post.
---
For what it's worth, comments and posts are up by quite a bit, compared to prologue release day, but still down compared to "War Eternal".  
---
The thing is, that the prologue release was *significantly* slower than *War Eternal* and even *All or Nothing* and the day after was still down by comparison, but nowhere near as much, so that leads me to believe that, if I want an actual comparison, I have to wait for the data of wednesday
---
You would be surprised how many bots are coded to use mouse instead keystrokes thinking that will make it harder to be detected.
---
We don't know how many episodes this saga will have though. What I said previously was about LS4 when it was first released. There is nothing datamined about LS5 (Icebrood Saga) tome.
---
Blue pilon, not red. Which is the most infuriating of all
---
IF YOU NEED A REAPER BUILD I CAN SORT YOU OUT BUT NOT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE FOR SOME REASON IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO COPY A BUILD TEMPLATE
---
I agree with the asmongold line of reasoning, if the game doesn't make you waste your life and abandon social obligations its not a good mmo
---
ok so go sub to netflix, don't put it in an mmo
---
and so war continues and now game is as it is - as chaotic as the playerbase
---
My mistake, I misread that part.
---
If your argument is mostly a tirade against me it doesn't make a strong argument to begin with
---
i thought the chests aren't stack oriented ??? are you level 2 in the mastery?
---
Players don't have a lot of tools to affect developers aside from complaining and voting with their wallet. People who like GW2 and still care about it are complaning on this reddit while other people are trying to silence their opinion with the "I like the current state, if you don't just shut up". Yes, they are mad.  
---
A lot of people who don't like GW2's current state are already playing other MMO's. This reddit is fighting frustrated loyal fans who are looking for a ray of hope.
---
There is definitely no healer needed for gold, au contraire
---
aparently it is. Level 1 of the red one.
---
I just want another cm...
---
yeah but not in OSRS, which is what this chart is referencing
---
alacrity renegade / firebrand - both also viable for open world content
---
Gues you just have not understand the new mastery
---
You can, just need t2 mastery
---
i don't recall getting the stacks, get level 2 in 4th option and you can open it - stacks are just for the attacks not opening the chests - this is misinformation that's being spread
---
Story related reasons prolly
---
you mean like how for 6 years any time someone said something bad about the game they'd get downvoted?
---
The chests aren't tied to stacks. They're tied to what level of mastery you have in the different tiers of Essence Manipulation
---
If you think me telling you that your handwriting is bad is my argument for the game being dead, then I don't know what to tell you buddy, a bit of a far fetch isn't it? I simply didn't make any argument for that case, there is no need - the evidence is all around you.
---
You think I am angry? LOL. OK. What ever you think man. Just like both sides, all you bunch do is just make excuses to blindly defend or criticize the game. Get real.
---
My guess is that they are like nuhoch wallows and jackal portals, linking two locations, since there's already closed gates leading to the other half, so there's no need to require that like with skritt holes in Silverwastes.
---
WvW was the second from the right before, now its nr 3.
---
Annoying as hell.
---
Your argument has been 80% "You're denial and also I don't like how you write" 20% "The game is dead and I know you know it because I know it!"
---
Absolutely convincing, for sure
---
At least it's something. Idk when the last BDO content update was.
---
I am so goddamn tired of people strawmanning incessant whining and bitching as "constructive criticism" here that I just don't want to even open and see this subreddit anymore. You wanted a dead community to prove your point? Well, you did your best to get it.
---
We still have two more strikes to discover, they could happen behind one of these doors. The current strike entrance is next to a similar gate and teleport us into the Raven Sactum. Maybe the strike entrance will move.
---
That might happen if people completely ignore the portals
---
Yeah but why can't they fly?
---
I'd play ESO if the PvP combat wasn't so janky and the fact that I have 100+ ping to a server in Texas while living 3 hours from the server.
---
Well, might be true but whats with the thing u do for hours and hours like the actual GAMEPLAY?
---
I just got additional inventory slot when gems were cheaper. I have 160 inventory spaces on main with just bags 20 .
---
100 gold for merely 12 inventory space is too much for me. If u need that much space u have a bad inventory management. I know because I had and that's why I got additional inventory slot. They I realized I should use more bank and a bank character. In you inventory there must be only what you strictly need. With build template and equip template I freed like 16 slots for additional weapons and armor .
---
Anyway Ty for the statistic . Nice to know it is much cheaper
---
Is this free content or do you pay for it like Living World? If so, is the cost comparable?
---
not necessarily but that depends on the project and the work that has to be done. so if you have a project that requires different steps to be done wouldn't make much sense to throw multiple devs at each step that all require the previous step while it isn't even implemented yet.
---
So having 20 people work on WvW would be great. But having 20 people work on implementing the Warclaw mechanic is not.
---
loud people here and on the forums often says that Anet doesn't listen to feedback... but in reality, Anet ARE actually listening, they're just not listening to *THEIR* personal feedback since they're part of a group that represent only 1% of the total playerbase or even 3% if we push it.  
---
Meanwhile... all the others are either sitting there trying to enjoy the game but can't because of the overly cynical forum and reddit community that keeps complaining about anything that Anet does.  
---
Or they try to post constructive and well written feedback threads that get either downvoted to oblivion because it's not all negative, or gets very little attention because it is an elaborate wall of text that requires extensive reading...
---
These packs are a godsend. Realized how reliant I was on these routes when I tried farming eternal ice nodes and essence chests without any sort of taco route.
---
It's the same. It is free for all who log in during the episode, and you have to pay if you missed out, just like every season before.
---
I don't need to defend my gameplay, I never said I was good. You're just being a dick to someone not even on the server, without any "proof " for that matter. Being a dick won't provide you anything worthwhile. You were entertaining but if you truly enjoy shaming a person on an online platform who didn't even ask your opinion... well I just feel bad for you then.
---
Btw I said completed all achievement. It means doing all the achievement in the tab.
---
For example I won't get all the boreal refined weapons since I do not like the helm (terrible) nor I need the bag
---
Long ago I would have done it for the sake of having all the tab colored and completed.
---
It is different tha. Saying I do not care at all about achievement. Clearer?
---
i got it by doing the necromancer event while the meta was going on so everyone was busy doing that while i was alone in the caves. as mentioned by others the clone spawns on the crystal/svanir caster phase and it takes a while for it to finally spawn and only 1 person gets his/her clone spawned
---
About the monthly fee, i spent more money in gw2 than in wow, much more. I know its not a must in gw2, but i do like support games which i like playing, even if it would be 100% free i would still ask for a donation bank account. 10 dollars to play a close to perfected game, is for me nothing. I prefer paying a fee and having a huge world with huge content than no fee like in gw2 were your praying to get a patch and pretend you are having fun in the game, been there in the past, was thinking the same about wows fee, but i was wrong, since you replied and i replied, if your reading this, putting games aside, i wish you are well and send you some positive energy, make yourself a beautiful day
---
Leveling is repetitive, but like VeryAmaze mentions, 1-80 is mainly a tutorial for game mechanics.  Once you hit 80, the game changes significantly, and there's a lot more to do.  If you're on a F2P account and want to mix it up, here are some options:
---
* dynamic events
---
* world bosses
---
* unranked pvp (you get boosted to 80 and have elite specs unlocked)
---
I'd also suggest buying the full version of the game.  HoT is now included for free when you buy PoF, so you'll have access to all of the base + expansion content, and you'll get some level 80 boosters, too.
---
You can also check out the stuff [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/wiki/newplayers#wiki_got_to_80.2C_what_now.3F) for info on what you can do after you hit level 80.
---
No
---
I liked it too.
---
For the whole 2 (maybe 3?) hours it took me to complete story, masteries, strike and log out to wait till next episode, cause there's aboslutely no reason to go there again.
---
Oh... They're in epi distance??? So it's easy mode largos, got it.
---
The question was probably poorly written I admit - basically I loved playing support Chrono a while back, but since then I've had a very long break from gw2, mostly logging in to do the new stories that came out then nothing more. And since then I've been wondering if there's any good support that work well in fractals/dungeons maybe a bit of open world if anything. My main classes has been Mesmer thief and Necro. Currently trying to see if I'll like fresh air tempest :).
---
this never seems to bother me as much as it does other people.. for one to me they are sort of just humanoid with animal features rather than actually being pure animals. Also the fact that armor can look cute and sexy on cats or lizards or whatever, that are shaped more like humans. I love the design of the charr though but they really did them a disservice trying to stretch out the regular armor instead of making different versions that would make more sense for their body type. Trying to put human-style armor on an animal looks just plain silly. And so I figure if games just make everyone sort of humanoid looking so the armor looks good I figure its a good middle ground
---
How about category 4: These aren't special sorting (equipment, consumables, crafting, junk) therefore I'm not interested. 
---
These are a long term investment, so I'd rather just eat the extra 50 gold and get a special sorting version instead.
---
It’s unfortunate to watch ArenaNet crumble piece by piece...
---
the new one has a 5head lmao
---
Isn't the new one actually closer to how it looks on objects in-game?
---
You're assuming that the unhappy players represent a big enough fraction of the total playerbase to cause the game to shut down in their absence. But that's obviously untrue, the *vast* majority of people playing the game enjoy the game and are going to stick around.
---
If every single person complaining on reddit uninstalled the game and never looked back, it wouldn't even show up as a small blip in this game's revenue. It would be entirely unnoticeable.
---
I will miss you, used to see each other everyday I logged in. sad day.
---
&gt;Well i only rant because i can't belive how people say anet is communicating after literally 8 comments on a forum that's been ignored for 2 years 
---
But they *are* communicating and, yet again, you are moving the goal posts of your [original comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dyn3de/developer_handles_on_the_guild_wars_2_forums/f82bcyw/). You clearly claimed that Arenanet only communicate about things related to the cash shop. That is a demonstrably false argument which is why you now need argue a totally different stance (ironically, using the very posts that disprove your original comment).
---
Now, if your original comment had been "Arenanet don't commuicate *sufficiently"* I'd have fully agreed with you. But you didn't. You chose to exaggerate a falsehood and it is attitudes like that, from players who by their own admission no longer play, which has led to the sub devolving to nonsense [like](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dzcdp9/reddit/) [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dzheha/every_single_time/). The world isn't as binary as that viewpoint but such polarisation isn't helping the community.
---
&gt; And also because you are calling me a liar, when you clearly never been through this before, several times anet tried to open up communications with playerbase 
---
I actually did no such thing. I said your posts were based on a falsehood, which they are. I made no mention about *you* being a liar, I simply stated a truth - your post is false and incorrect. 
---
It is nice that you are now presuming I've never been through issues with communication regarding game modes. That is also a [demonstrably false presumption](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/74up84/raid_and_instanced_pve_balance_in_gw2_is_poor_and/). I could also go through my official forum posts critiquing issues with the game (and the communication!) but I'm not really convinced that you want to discuss this on an even ground.
---
&gt; but the scam there is that they are not communicating, they just announce stuff, ask for feedback, ignore feedback and screw the game a bit more, after players get dissapointed and complain they go back to silent treatment again and again, until the last 2 years, right after pof launch that they decided "screw this we are doing whatever we want and we are not replying anymore on forums, let them scream to the void" 
---
I agree that Anet's communication is poor. *That doesn't mean that Anet don't communicate and is not what your original post said*. See how much easier it is to get people to agree with you when you are actually truthful and accurate in what you say instead of just going with blase exaggerations that just feed into the useless negative polarisation of this sub and community?
---
For what it is worth, I agree entirely with this point, particularly in regards to PvE aspects such as raiding and fractals. Even then, it remains a falsehood to say that feedback and communication doesn't happen. It absolutely does. Look at the feedback regarding Desert Borderlands, or the Birds instability, or more recently the request for feedback on 99CM and 100CM. It happens. It just *isn't enough*.
---
&gt; those "possible balance changes" posts are also a scam, they don't look back at the feedback they ask for, they put those out there so players think they are listening and keep hopes up, because players who doesn't quit are still a source of income 
---
You have absolutely no evidence for this but, as an aside, if I received an email telling me that anything I do with my job is a scam it would get ignored. That isn't the way to get communication across.
---
&gt; thats the only reason why i tell you to wake up, because you are claiming anet is doing something good when it's actually the same scam over and over again every few years 
---
No, I am not claiming Anet is "doing something good". Stop putting words into peoples' mouths. I get that it is easier to argue if you just make up what is happening but that is going to get us as a community nowhere. I pointed out that Anet actually don't just communicate about cash shop stuff. Which by your own admission and subsequent arguing is absolutely correct. 
---
Funnily enough, if you'd actually read my posts instead of being worried about going off on one for being called out due to being incorrect you'd have seen that [I'm perfectly aware](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dyn3de/developer_handles_on_the_guild_wars_2_forums/f84xqy8/) there is a whole host of issues with the game. I'm even raising them and discussing them in other threads!
---
&gt; I would even argue the one giving false claims is you.... 
---
I'm sure you would. Would you like to point out where anything I have said is demonstrably false? And no, putting words into my mouth and going off on rants about tangential topics doesn't count. Nice attempt at gish galloping though.
---
&gt; But im sure i won't belive it anyways, so i agree it's better to finish this discussion here, time will tell who is right, meanwhile you keep posting decent balance discussions and watch how anet reacts, you will see what i mean 
---
[I've been posting about balance issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/74up84/raid_and_instanced_pve_balance_in_gw2_is_poor_and/) for a long time (ironically, many of the larger changes I suggested have actually happened - we no longer need two warriors, two druids and two chronos in raids - but lets not worry about that!). I agree with finishing the discussion because seeing as you want to end with personal snipes and claiming that I'm the one making false remarks I don't see this getting anywhere else.
---
It's been fun though! Always nice to see into the mind of the people that have quit and not moved on. Further responses will be ignored. Bye!
---
From someone who played Chrono for a good while, I love firebrand both as healer or support, it's the only healer I've ever liked to play, and it's a fun and versatile support able to ditch some serious damage. Try it out, you'll probably like it.
---
And why is it wrong to enjoy it in an mmo?
---
Guess I just like having everything on a keybind
---
No, its not normal for ompany which focus on MMORPG. They're not publisher.
---
That is fine, I was just saying "don't judge us clickers" :D
---
It's what happens when people build their identity around whatever entertainment they consume. A symptom of capitalism, I guess.
---
I mean... without the meta, the map would be a borderline pacifist zone the size of Bloodstone Fen.
---
I don't understand why they didn't make Bjora Marches more oppressive. This is supposed to be the domain of an elder dragon. It should be difficult enough for you to *want* essence manipulation just to survive.
---
I thought the Hunger achi was going to end up kind of explaining how the boneskinner was made, in that the kodan was going to turn into one, and the story would repeat.
---
at least it's more content than we get from the game now
---
TLDR
---
it should be possible to change email accounts bound to the game, i did.
---
years ago i used my ISP providers email account to create the game, but i didnt realise i would change providers so much and i moved on from the game 5 years ago. when i wanted to come back to the game i no longer had that email.
---
support were able to bind the game to my new email address and restore my account, there must have been a 2 year gap when i didnt play but they did it.
---
At least with the newest currency, you can trade any quantity of it for Season 4 currency at the vendor, and then convert that to Volatile Magic.
---
A shame you can't do that with the Grothmar Wardowns currency yet.
---
You need to learn the proper uses of you're\*
---
........soon™
---
They told gaming journalists in a preview session - the rotation ends with Boneskinner who's supposed to be the hardest strike boss.
---
That doesn't make sense. People who run bots know that bot detection systems are looking for patterns that are unlike the patterns of a real human. So they'd actually want to use the keybind, since that's how a human would do it.
---
They reset every day. You still have credit for them for the meta-achievement, even if they aren't currently checked off.
---
I'm with you there, the story has always had me hooked in GW2. The stuff with Marjory was some *shit*.
---
i didnt realise it was a joke until you pointed it out. i was reading all the job titles wondering who was head of sale, now i get it.
---
Or you can go for the achievement later, when the prices drop, and make some gold now.
---
Or you can go for the achievement and skins later, when the prices drop, and make some gold now.
---
Bro... I run Cms+t4s every day. I FEEL YOU.
---
SR ans Deepstone are the salt of the earth. 0 fun, gimicky, overly long... They suck. Deepstone has like... No mechanics? I mean, you need to be pretty stupid to drop through a hole 3 times (or whatever times it takes to kill you), and SR whole difficulty curve is convincing your rene to use reflect bubble...
---
Also i loved old 40, new one is "the same but with content padding" (to be honest, i don't understand why we skip instead of killing, they drop heavy miner bags like crazy).
---
Don't
---
&gt;Why don't people "just leave" then? Various reasons, all personal for that individual. Maybe community. Wanting the game to be better. Many, like myself, stick around because we hope that the game can go back to its roots, abandon the lootbox/gemstore fuckery, and deliver a great game, like they did with the first Guild Wars (and how games used to be pro-consumer, whether by design or technological limitation)
---
That kind of "naive" game design is a shadow of the past from the early 2000's. It is gone forever. Gw2 will not be this game because the industry has evolved designs that are much more efficient than "lets make a good game and hope people buy it."
---
If this works the same way as raids, you can leave the instance and kick them from outside, even if they are in combat.
---
&gt;Aaaaand it... just didn't appear. At all.
---
I've found the bone skinner a few times, it may be glitched or not working as intended for you but there is a camp fire that you interact with that spawns him briefly, he takes a swing at you. I've had him show up 3x randomly out of nowhere in about 4 hours on the map as well, nowhere near the meta event, usually in the forest. Enough time for you to hit him 2-3x and hes gone. I'm walking around (no mounts) and hes spawning out of thin air, smacking you around and hes gone.
---
&gt;I really want to talk to someone that can help recover my account. I can still name most of my characters, guilds, friends, gear, build. It's just that I lost that email that had all the "proper" information. I really want someone to be able to check my account and see it's me. I can organize a time to live chat, I can send all my screenshots, anything I can remember that will help I'll tell you. IT'S REALLY MY ACCOUNT.
---
I was able to change my account email address when I came back to play the game. I started soon after release, left after the boring zerg mess of Southsun and started again in late 2014 / early 2015 - I think. The email address that was previously used had since been deleted. I also couldn't remember my security questions as I previously used random answers and saved them in an encrypted file I forgot the password for, on a hard drive that ended up unhappy with TrueCrypt and borked. 
---
I provided as many real life details as I could, character names and also the serial code and was able to get my email changed to a new one and was able to log in.
---
I can't imagine someone wanting all 5-10 of their bag slots being special sorting. I personally wouldn't want more than 3 and I already use 1-2x 28/32 slot invis bags on my main characters. I like the compact feature and invisible does what I would want any other special sort to to do
---
But maybe I'm missing something here. What do you like the sorts for?
---
Yep, it's half done already :-)
---
okay but why
---
Honestly, Taco makes that super easy.
---
Yaaay.  Thank you ❤
---
Can you tell me what happened with Mesmer? I remember playing ages ago when their new stuff came out and it was top tier. Did they get nerfed or replaced in functionality?
---
Yeah, after eating a Lich who was impossible to kill and absorbing all of his magic and resurrecting powers. Call it an ex machina, but it definitely did not come out of left field.
---
It wasn't the debris, but the fact we nuked him out of the heavens.
---
FINALLY got my clone to spawn and got the achievement.  I don't what, if anything, I did to finally trigger the clone.  But I do want to note that I think it's possible for there to be more than one clone at a time.  At the same time my clone was out, the NPC Lessandro's clone was out as well.  So I don't think each event is limited to just one clone.
---
Wow I actually thought I was seeing ghosts but it DID change!
---
The post is about Almorra...
---
For half the development time we got about half the total content in almost all areas lol  
---
That said, they absolutely nailed the mood of the story, atmosphere of the map, and more importantly:  People will be able to come to this map for the frist time ever and have a reasonable ability to do the majority of the content on it.  That does come with drawbacks, but I assume we can expect to see more in January, after the Wintersday holiday has passed.  
---
The champions seem to be a bit soft overall (Some more than others) and the event structure is mostly centered around the story.  
---
Only ran the new meta once, felt like it dragged out a while on the defense, then the construct was downed and spanked pretty handily though I really expected that after seeing the other champs on the map.  
---
New mastery thus far is a complete meh.  I'm assuming it's supposed to be an equalizing blaster beam for when nobody's left to run the content but that remains to be seen.  
---
I do like that none of the collections are blatant stupid grind like "subdue 500 crazed fans" or "kill 1000 mobs in each of the 3 major regions of the zone" types of deals.  
---
Single greatest part of this release though:  Instant Beetle Juice.
---
The new mastery is ass and doesn't add anything to the game.
---
My friend will be buying PoF during Christmas so if you have spare code, then I'll gladly take it for my necromancer friend :)
---
Isn't there going to be a legendary version in strike mission?
---
You are missing the point, Almorra survived Kralkatorik flying over her head while her whole warband got corrupted but then she ends up dying by some falling rocks, which is very anti climatic.
---
The one I was missing was blended into the keep wall and was on a elevation below the platform.
---
There isnt really anything that can make it easier sadly, just have to try and memorize which you allrdy hit. I would start with hitting the ones that are the furthest away.
---
More enemies is functionally equivalent to more AoEs and that fractal was already full of them but those weren't really improvements or detraction, just different.
---
The actual improvement are the changes to Horrik and adding markers for the different fixation. For a bad or inexperienced group the markers changes does nothing but at least with the change to Horrik you no longer have the case where you have an enemy in a fight but killing it is detrimental to the group's success.
---
&gt; People who run bots know
---
Not necessarily. 
---
Small skripts like that are pretty easy to code, even when just following some internet guide. Every idiot can write some.   
---
Usually theyre written by those that use them or a direct friend, especially in "low demand" situations.

*press B*

White Knight of the Fan [BOYS] vs Haters Gonna [HATE]
---
Actually when I saw this thread was going to mention this as well, definitely check it out
---
They don't even need to make the mobs harder for this, the key is to have them be *dangerous enough* to the objectives we're defending.  They could otherwise fill in the gaps with hordes of non-scaled level 80 mobs flowing out of those mists portals... Icebrood and Svanirs have always been plenty nasty on their own without needing a lot of buffs.
---
So the one I missed till at 290/300 was the one that was towards the wall at medium height. it just blends in very well because it has the brick wall as a backdrop. I don't know if that's the number you're missing though.
---
This subreddit has gone at war with itself!
---
The intro might have been shorten as well? So that might be another improvement ...
---
This much information on the web? Correct me if I'm wrong, I'm pretty sure I left out some crucial information.
---
Well you are right, i agree, 8 replies in 2 years is actual communication, a single post would work by your standards to say anet is communicating to playerbase... yet it seems a bit binary to me you know.. calling communication 8 replies after so much time on the dark... how convenient...
---
By labeling what i say as "false" you are calling me either ignorant or liar.. funny that you actually left out the part where i defend my statements with evidence.. like the paragraph about scourges recent changes, or chrono neglection...
---
also funny how you asume i wrote this sort of comments towards anet and thats why im beeing ignored... when i said several times that i spent hours making well written paragraphs with serious feedback in a respectfull manner, all for nothing as so many other players including you i bet already did
---
but the most fun part is at the end where you say " ironically, many of the larger changes I suggested have actually happened **"** yet your favourite phrase you used to diminish all of what i say was "you got no evidence on that"
---
and how about you? why don't you show me a change you suggested and the release note addressing that change?
---
I had the same problem in 2015, I could not get my old email back. I contacted the support and explained my stuation and and it took about 3 weeks and they gave me my account back. I gave them characters names and where I had traveled and logged in from.
---
I gave up first on the account and bought another, but luckly I got it back.
---
Good luck to you.
---
Fuck yeah guys!!! We have more upvotes than the whiteknight version!!!!
---
That was the cause, thank you very much!
---
That's what you get when "those who love the game" hate on content creators until they leave.
---
And we're the ones ruining the game. /s
---
Shills, fanboys, and white knights can't meme anyway.
---
They changed Chrono shatters (+ other nerfs like Signet of Inspiration not giving but only extending existing boons) and it is very clunky, unfun and unrewarding to play in fractals. Now you have to have at least 1 active clone to shatter. Revenant and Firebrand combo has more uptime of the buffs Chrono gives so it is just easier or replace Chrono.
---
The debuff can be removed by walking out of range of the cave detour that the shaman is in. At least it works for me.
---
it's still stupid 
---
but ye stability and aegis all the way
---
That's not _your_ email on full display, I hope?
---
Sad, but unsurprising.
---
Thanks for the work.
---
More like the next four months. Lot of people stopped giving a shit, this last episode was the nail on the coffin.
---
[This could be why it got 4 times faster.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dzhu3p/can_this_be_moved_back_please/)
---
It's been like that for years. I had elaborate posts get killed by the downvote brigade the first try, then upvoted by the hundreds when posted at a different hour.
---
It's really about the simple ideology of: "if you have nothing nice to say, don't say anything at all". No one is against criticism, but people don't like the whining. That's really the important distinction that gets mixed up. 
---
Complaining without constructive feedback is just toxic whining, no one likes that guy who is always negative and only talks about things he hates.
---
Complaining while bringing up what Anet should be doing can actually be turned into useful discussion that brings both sides together. This sub needs more of that, and less of the complaining for the sake of complaining.
---
It's not that (some of us) don't accept that things can be criticized. I agree that this was a short update, but it's not like there aren't blind haters either.
---
I was really hoping that it would be a helm to rival the Stag cultural helm, but it honestly didn't impress me. Something about the visor looks off to me.
---
There's one that's so far that for some people it will not track the hit, so what you see and what happens in the servers will not match.  When it looks like the projectile is passing through it, it actually isn't, because the aiming and visual corrections that happens when a projectile tracks the target is not happening.
---
The trajectory  of the projectile won't be corrected and you'll depend on hitting the misaligned shot by sheer luck.  
---
It's the one farthest away flying all the way to the west over the walls of the keep.
---
Tired of never hitting it, I jumped on the skyscale, flew over it, and surprise surprise, I got the prompt to use it. So I used it, it exploded, and the achievement dinged. 
---
This is a lesson taught to us by all these events in which they give you siege machines to attack and sink a boat. For get the ranged weapons, jump on the water, and PUNCH the ship.
---
I can very much understand dropping out during A Realm Reborn. I'm FFXIV's biggest fan and even then, I'm gonna agree: ARR was shitty. It was badly paced, there was a lot of padding that there didn't need to be, and even in terms of combat, classes feel bare and not that fun to play. A Realm Reborn is rough.
---
That said, if you can stomach it through to 50 and hit Heavensward, the game *really* does pick up. If you can find a guild of like-minded folks, the game gets even better too with the company (though this is the same for any MMO.) Classes at 50 start to develop some semblance of flashy skills that you can chain together in a rotation and the story exponentially improves in terms of pacing, character development and boss design too. Gathering and crafting can also be fun too - depending on what you like to do. Each of them are little "mini games" almost, with their own resources to manage that can improve the quality of items you gather/craft, or quantity you gather, etc. etc. (That said, you might also find gathering and crafting to be tedious and I wouldn't fault you if you did. I hated crafting until the recent overhaul streamlined the experience, myself.)
---
What server are you on? If you're in need of company or help running some dungeons, I'd be happy to give you a hand. Feel free to message me if that might interest you.
---
You're toxic if you don't love THE WHOLE game, didn't you know?
---
Criticism is negative, even if it's constructive. The same fanboys, shills, and white knights complaining "your criticism isn't constructive" find other excuses to shut you down when it's actually constructive, or have we already forgotten "armchair developers", "small indie company", and the other multitude of bullshit excuses?
---
Maybe wait a week, to get even more data. Anyway, looking forward to it!
---
pretty sure there’s both
---
So everyone who made achievement guides were raiders then, I guess? Cause there's no one left.
---
I can't say I've had any of these experiences myself, while running around in the map. Not to say you're wrong mind you, I just know that I've not seen the Boneskinner at all. I haven't heard whispers that lead me to camps, haven't seen it outside of the Escort event and then it as the Champion, and I've *definitely* never been attacked by it (or seen anybody else attacked by it for that matter.)
---
The only thing that comes close to "spooky" is an abandoned tent and camp fire I've been to that has a tree briefly appear to look like Almorra, or some other Charr Vigil soldier, that then just turns back into a tree when I approach. But no whispers, no Boneskinner... nada.
---
Maybe he just doesn't like me.
---
They'd rather kill the game than admit their superior moral ground is wrong.
---
Anyone know the account limit on the ice nodes?
---
She wasnt killed by debris. It was her grave, which is clearly stated in the dialogue.
---
It's not a lion any more it's a hedgehog 🦔
---
They wouldn't even attach to mine when I pressed the special action key.
---
Piken, too bad they open it twice a year.
---
suppose they wanted to avoid the "stack here and dps" but sometimes  it's the only way
---

---
When can we buy memes on the gem store?
---
well, why do you think it started doubling from 2018 and onwards?
---
its because anet added a lot of new stuff to them, including super rare infusions.
---
so that put the entire demand on it completely on end, and not just the raw demand but also people who are willing to powertrade them, market flip them, buy hoards of them and sit on them to make a profit, etc.
---
putting summarizing data on tots from 5+ years ago, after so much has changed to the loot being offered in them is completely pointless since it will have no bearing whatsoever in predicting where tots will go.
---
only data you should be looking at is what happened with tots from halloween 2018 and onwards.
---
Well, I am happy to see it didnt end up being a December or even January release, and the size of the map isnt that small either. Particularly since it will likely expand, I'm even more excited to see what will happen. I'm just disappointed that overall, I will play this map for about two weeks and have most of the chievos done then it's time to wait in my "disgruntled gw2 player" time-out corner xD.
---
The fun/good thing is that I'm rarely ever disappointed by the *quality* of what they release, it's just that I never find it to be terribly repeatable/ unless it was one of the medes from a expansion. Those were really cool in HoT and LWS3 era.
---
Someone has got to have Tier 2 Blue already. I maxed my masteries late last night and I wasn't even rushing
---
im always wondering what kind of players and end up in GW 2. i had to turn off music after 20 mins,bcs constant UUUUUUUuuuu and iiiiiiiiIIIIIIIII was so fcking annoing,anyway try SOMA,DEAD SPACE,ALIEN ISOLATION,ALAN WAKE,AMNESIA,OUTLAST and you gona yaaaawn thru *horror* which GW 2 offer.
---
It is CONFIRMED that it will expand.
---
Where as I am not disagreeing with you but they never said each episode would have more content. They just said the saga would have more content. They could be referring to over the course of the whole saga.
---
Aw man I thought this sub would be different from r/wow :(
---
This is what I’ve been doing. Made about 200g from my own crafted ones and bought a few at 38g to resell at 54g. I’ll get the skins and achievement later.
---
You mean by inflating the market to where anything below having 1000 gold is poverty level?
---
Yeah, the trials don't trigger if you've done it already that day, but now I'm not sure if for a char to be able to do it again, do you need to wait for buff to expire or will waiting for daily reset do...
---
It might depend on if people kill portals or not. The longer portal stays the more mobs happen? My map usually focused portals immediately
---
Her trying to call Kasmeer is what really got me. I wonder if they're gonna take it further in the next episode.
---
The true faction war / guild war is always in the sub
---
I will speak as a WvW player. Content drought has never hurt me that much because lol I'm used to getting content never. I am usually satiated by having 40 idiots run the Benny Hill around a Lord Room. I have half of LS3 and nearly all of LS4 to go. I have 8k hours played and probably have a lot more to do. I won't go anywhere.
---
But....
---
How can you defend the recent development of the game? There is only Living Story planned in the future. A new fractal or even further fractal development is nowhere to be seen. Communication, while always terrible, is to a new low. They can't even pretend to be enthusiastic about the future. At least WvW alliances were some degree of roleplay. Nope, none of that anymore. What else have they done? A triple monetized atrocity of a template system that will take months to fix? Moving the trading post icon?  
---
Many may think that shills and haters are equal, but this is false. Yes, hateful people can be disruptive and never satisfied, and need to be filtered out, but everyone knows this. But nobody remembers to filter out the mindless positivity. 
---
If you're heading off a cliff, which person is more useful?
---
* The person that yells "Hey, dumbass, stop!"
---
* The person that goes "Everything is fine. Just keep going"
---
While the former may need to reconsider their tone and also being an asshole, at least they're more likely to save you than the second person who is never useful and at worst detrimental. 
---
Now you could definitely say people should calm down more and also not see every bump as a cliff, yes. But this is something that has gone on for years and years and that is an eternity in the gaming mode. And at this point, it seems to me that the shills are the ones doing more damage. Doing nothing has never gotten anything.... How many QoL changes would have never happened if players said nothing? When they tried to pull that shit where you could only buy gems in increments of 400, it took an uproar to get the custom change. Also, think about most broken content.
---
Because if you say nothing, it means you are complicit. Many people in here refuse to do that, because they know they deserve better.
---
So having just come back from the other reddit page with the same, but opposite, meme...
---
I have 0 problem with the story itself, or how the map looks, its events etc.
---
Well, only 1 on this: Boneskinner is not dunking on enough people/not nearly as threatening as I expected. Now, that could be a problem with scaling (or lack thereof after a certain threshold), and that would be ok if it were ever addressed. I do not believe it will be 
---
The problem I have with the release itself is that I'll probably be done with the majority of achievements/be pretty over it in abooout 2-3 weeks depending on how the ol' work/life/DMing for my D&amp;D group balance goes.
---
I rarely /ever/ have a problem with the *quality* of a release. It only bothers me that there's just not a lot to do her the long-term. If I need to I'll just chill out and 1 versus world but, I was really hoping that this particular episode would be a tad meteor than it was.
---
The meme doesn't make sense because it's "who would win" and the 2 options are Kralkatorrick vs rocks lol.
---
If I want to play a beast race I want to play exactly that and not a painted human / human with fur. Same goes for gender dimorphism which some games have (male race is a massive animal like creature, female is a human with ears and tail), keep that shit away from me. Personally I'm not interested in having them look "sexy", though I understand that's different for others, no matter if Khajiit or Charr. But yes, Charr/Asura armor being the stretched version of human armor an absolute shame, though I disagree that having the same basemodel is a "good middle ground", imo it's lazy and boring.
---
"So bad I'm going to stop paying $1,000s per month and only log in once in a while for new content and sometimes wvw and maybe dailies"
---
works fine for me too
---
Meme begat meme
---
well not 100% but at least they looked similar
---
Yeah where is Kas supposed to be anyway?
---
Yes, very good.
---
Still in Grothmar I guess? I hope she heads north soon, she's been underutilized in recent episodes.
---
But we'll make you a teeny, tiny subforum over and over until you all quit in disgust.
---
&gt;The fact scripting in GW2 story missions gives them the same gameplay problems as military shooters
---
An utterly vague and asinine statement.
---
&gt;"Modern military shooter" refers to the subgenre of FPS games that heavily script and constrain the singleplayer mode
---
So does Half-Life, but I'm pretty sure the HL series doesn't classify as an MMS.
---
&gt;often infamous for regenerating health
---
Call of Duty doesn't have regenerating health.
---
&gt;boundaries
---
Most games do, with the slight exception of open world games, which are an utterly bland and overdone design fad at this point.
---
&gt;quick time events.
---
Call of Duty didn't have QTEs either.

"decent rewards " are we playing the same game ?

We don't know yet.

Too true and too bad, but do BL kits increase the chance of more than 1 eitrite?

Yeah maybe I'm mis-remembering but it feels like Jory and Kas haven't been together for any significant amount of time since like Season 3. Almost always one or the other

wtf? what money? if they shut down there is no more money then... and im sure as any other company they still have debts and services they must pay it's not so simple to close a company you know...

u can get one salvaging a exotic berzerk anyway.

Would be great to get an update that swaps build templates, but the current build still runs fine. Do you chainload with ArcDPS?

I was joking.
---
Wouldn't it be also sufficient to add random delays between keystrokes instead of simulating mouse movements.
---
Any of the current t1/2 servers or the servers floating between t2/3 that aren't full are fine.
---
If its like season 2 you'll get the previous part of the map but have to buy the episode 1 story.
---
&gt; A
---
They couldn't have her pick up right then because that conversation would probably be pretty private and we were there. :P
---
Kas and Jory haven't shared party-time in a long while but did spend ALL of season 4 together - off screen. The story didn't need them as it pretty much focused on Taimi, Braham and Rox and from that perspective it has always made sense to keep Dragon's Watch split in different constellations.
---
But I like they are consistent with 'tough and independent' Marjory deep down actually being the needier of the two. While GW2 storytelling can be pretty blunt at times, the characterizations are in many ways surprisingly subtle. Which is why I really enjoy having NPC's around. :) 
---
(CANACH! When we threw him in jail during S1 I had no idea he would turn into such an awesome presence...)
---
nah its droping fast and only first few madmans buying stuff for that price. shoulders from last strike started on 500g and now they are for 120 or so.
---
Yeah you say it like that it totally makes sense how dragons arent immortal yet are easily capable of living for 10s of thousands of years with relative ease. Obviously the magic keeping a lich together should be much more potent in that regard compared to a krytan god or an elder dragon. Really does beg the question that if Glint knew of this and im assuming the other dragons did as well why none of them tried eating a lich which any of them easily well could have done seeing how easy it was for a preteen Aurene was capable of doing so. its almost as if....its a storytelling loophole.
---
wat
---
Fucking absolutely yes, if the profits continue to flow in while they give us jack shit for content, they will just keep doing what they're doing. If it actually affects their bottom line, they will be forced to make changes.
---
How does the first episode story work? Does it take you to the map?
---
If so, and you only have episode 2, how will you get there without paying $$$ or gems?
---
We've already established your poi ion is irrelevant and I have yet to see you offer something better.
---
I also got an urge to replay the Witcher with some of the sound design/music from this patch.
---
So that would be
---
Episode 1: Black Citadel - chopper - Bjora's Marches
---
Episode 2: Core Tyria - chopper - Bjora's Marches
---
I guess the story will have us traveling a lot then even though it's basically the same map
---
Well we don't know if it was Maclaine that did the music for this episode because he is freelance now.
---
It's the loot from the chests worth farming xp and mastery points?
---
I'm guessing no, from prior experience?
---
I was unaware as I did since I did not watch guild chat. However, this wasn't the point of the post and I'd like hear your actual feedback instead of trying to "point out" it wasn't unexpected.
---
You get the ingots that u need to craft restored weapons. Also strike rewards need the masteries too. And also you don't need to farm, you need very little xp
---
I'm software engineer (third party software maintenance to be more specific), whenever I work with colors they're RGB because web or something like that.
---
CMYK is standard if you're going to work in printing industry or if you're a designer who's working on anything that's going to be printed.
---
None is superior, both have their application. rgb (additive) for on-screen and cmyk (subtractive) for printing.
---
in wow they surely where for fishing. 
---
the point is that the most safe way to get info from the game is reading the screen .
---
ocr on the image and , knowing where is what , give a meaning to what's on screen. then click on a certain position and so on.
---
First of all point\*. Secondly you didnt ask. But since he/she looking for builds for condi reaper i would say its ass so he/she is much better off playing power. Now in regards to using builds that arent actual garbage youre better off using snowcrows, discretize, lucky noobs. Hell id use mystic builds before id touch fucking metabattle
---
He still seems to be in charge of the Soundcloud, though.
---
Is it higher health sustain than P/P unload spam?  Given you're not in a party and benefiting from exterior buffs, I wonder how close the sustained DPS would be between both builds.
---
I didn't watch the extra life stream and i only briefly looked at the extra life achievement once, so i also thought this was a new addition just for the episode.
---
Its still a nice change as they can now accomplish with 1 achievement what used to require multiple. This could even lead to more rewarding achievements and quests
---
Personally I really like it. It gives you a little extra push to keep getting a little bit further... A lot of the achievements they've come with recently are like "do x 100 times" and that's just.. Nah.. But if they put a little tier reward in there id think "oh go on I'll just do a tier"
---
Isn't there slow and some damage? As an ele, I somehow always faint at the stupid elemental.
---
Bind extra mouse buttons to F13+ then use autohotkey to remap keys
---
I don't mind either, sometimes I want to play an actual beast and sometimes just a sexy humanoid creature. The armor has to be done right for beast mode though, I don't play charr just because of the lack of options and that saddens me because it's a cool looking race
---
Looks far more interesting (mechanically) than the one in the prologue.
---
Well yes, because it works a bit differently from the rest of the game. It needs to update it's contents and add new items dynamically, regardless of updates. Also it needs to interact in real time between EU and NA servers.
---

---
I thought it's only useful in strikes for players not used to cc and boons?
---
You can find it on youtube, search channel MICHRAM
---
Michram records the music in-game and as a result is unable to obtain clean track starts and endings a lot of the time.
---
&gt;How does the expanded map in Ep2 work?
---
Fixed your question. Only ANet knows.
---
Scary. Complicated. Duuuh. Thank you for your answer! Gladly I found some ppl by accidental that already spawned Champion one and we killed it with 3 ppl. But I would need this advice for sure later on Scyskale collection.
---
Oh noooo! An even cuter talking cat!
---
I am old mmo player, for me grind is 100s of hours of monster killing.
---
Some people have pointed out that raven portals that are at several locations in part 1 of the map might be portal that bring you to part 2 of the map (would work like Skritt tunnels or Nuhoc Wallows) instead of creating a couple of passes between the 2 areas. If this is the case you could simply directly start the mission in part 2 (with the usual side trip to Black Citadel to take a copter) without the need to access part 1. That would be an horrendous design though and would completely negate the fact that they enlarged the same map instead of just creating a separate map.
---
You all dont understand. It was not debris... 
---
It. Was. Gravity Dragon.
---
Yeah, I got it, was just replying to the other dude.
---
I think the beauty of the boneskinner comes out in the strike mission next week. Fractal cm boneskinner would be epic tho.
---
Tengu or Largos, plz
---
"Why is the game I love shutting down?! Where did everyone go?!"
---
Well you see, when enough people are encouraged to leave and then finally do so... 
---
Ask Gaia Online. Their "shut up your feedback is stupid the site is fine" approach *somehow* drove people away!
---
If you read the next paragraph, you're actually going to understand that PoE and some others are the only ones who come to mind that don't follow this criticism.
---
Which is lifted once you subscribe once and become a Preferred player. All it takes is buying the game once to permanently unlock all expansions and DLCs, even after said subscription is over. The game doesn't charge extra for expansions or any new content.
---
And sweets don't belong in your diet either.
---
You people don't get that WE hunt the boneskinner, not the other way around.
---
It's an mmo and you are a god/dragonslayer, go play a horror game if you want to be a mobs bitch
---
Also no mount? What loo
---
When dealing with incomplete information things can end up not true but not be a lie. No indication that when you (personal) said "you" that it was royal, so if it was in fact directed at the OP then it was in fact not true because of the experience they described. If it was said to be general, you still run the risk of being wrong when talking to the 5% of your made-up statistic.
---
Fun fact, the entire heat mechanic is unnecessary. You can just wander around, letting your frost stacks get to 20, then you can just break yourself out before you even get to like 50%HP--it even counts for the achievement! The meta might not even be something you can lose. it may very well be that every now and then, the map spawns tons of zero exp mobs and you have to wait out the 15ish mins for the little reward.
---
I bought it at its release. Didn't seem to do anything. And I bloody well hope paying a sub makes the game playable and accessible. It's F2P version though is just EA deepthroating you with their cronenberg dick. No, thanks.
---
Pretty sure rocks fell on the cat not the raven though.
---
Nobody knew this and the dragons on their own did not consider him a threat, hence they leave him alone. I'm certain Aurene knew, but only after eating him. 
---
Elder dragons don't go around eating all types of humans either, do they? Just because they could, doesn't mean that's what they want to do.
---
Feels like it does about 2k dps to you if you don't break out immediately.
---
I haven't seen the blue glow, but there was an event start icon on the campfire near the bridge leading into Asgeir's Legacy. There were people crying for help, and when I interacted with the campfire, a legendary boneskinner spawned invulnerable, it then summoned some enemies and left.
---
Hey! I'm currently having the same discussion with people on another one of these meme!
---
Last time I tried, the game doesn't even register F13-F24.
---
We already know there never will be CM. Maybe in private server years from now.
---
Gonna have to look into this, sounds awesome.
---
We all do, friend.
---
We all do.
---
Well form a line. My big weird gangly arms are ready.
---
My iq is too low, can someone explain?
---
Nice and small. Just right to complete in the 10 min you are waiting for the meta ro progress.
---
Yup. I used to be like. Aaah this game has its flaws but it has cool dungeons and fractals and raids and it has such great potential! And I told people who were considering to buy the game.  
---
Like you said, that’s completely gone now, I’ve stopped playing and given up completely.
---
Black Lion
---
Note the 'thinking' bit.
---
Anything can be detected. Eventually.
---
OHHHHHHHH
---
Ye it was worth my money, I paid the full price for all of it and had a great few years in this game with great people. 
---
But it’s over now, I’m just done. And it actually really saddens me when I think of it now...
---
Guess what happened xD
---
That's a map currency, not a cross-map currency.
---
Cross-map currencies are obtained and spent in more than one map:
---
* Gold
---
* Karma
---
* Unbound magic
---
* Volatile magic.
---
* Trade Contracts.
---
etc
---
Well, to be fair I die quite often to those spellbreaker harpies in Istan.
---
support chronomancer is still very good, but it isn't the be all end all anymore.
---
Firebrand is the new big support class. Tons of boons, good healing, and tons and tons of utility. Renegade is more of a DPS than it is a support, but it's still one of two builds that can share alacrity to allies, so it is used often if a Chrono isn't present.
---
Basically, you can run the old PvE comp of Chrono for quickness/alacrity/misc boons, and Druid for healing/might/misc boons, and 3 DPS. This comp is very good for raids since they are both very 10-target-focused with their support. In Fractals, Firebrand (quickness, might, heals, etc) alongside Renegade (DPS+Alacrity) is very popular.
---
Both are equally good, though. It's all about just filling in the gaps when it comes to your group. You can have a Chrono focus on DPS+Alacrity if you don't have a Renegade. Boons are boons.
---
Sent through a private message \^^
---
ofc it doesn't have to be huge meta event level... but like even the abhorrent skelk and fallen leopard shaman are harder champions in that very area that is themed around the boneskinner. i'm inclined to say even the fallen portal event is more  interesting.
---
Chrono can still do the boon support, its just that between firebrand &amp; renegade there will be more over all dps because one of them using diviner will do allot more dps then a chrono can.
---
That is mainly due to the fact that the renegade gets +55% critical chance from traits so using diviner doesn't really effect them anywhere near as much as other people where dps is concerned.
---
The icon went from a regal and elegant lion to a kawaii hedgehog.
---
I'm not exactly happy, but whatever I guess.
---
Call it what you will. But im certainly not wrong.
---
Ooooo ex-Anet huh. Anyways I’ve always wondered why the sizes of the characters are not in the same scale, but I guess that’s why!
---
While I agree it's a waste of a model for just one underwhelming event, I don't think the whole area or the event needs to change just to cater to it. It's not a single player jumpscare game.  
---
It could have been used differently, tho. Maybe as a separate entity to the event. Without removing the current event. 
---
For example, the current event would be an introduction, and when defeating it, it would run away instead dying. At some point of the story it locks on you, and until you advance the story and hunt it down, it would be hunting you instead.   
---
You'd be walking in any thick snowy forest area in any shiverpeaks maps like the giant trees in bitterfrost or the forest in snowden drifts, and it'll jump on you, and if you don't dodge, it would sometimes leave you downed, and sometimes start a short fight event to drive it away.
---
Almost like we were promised a monster and now are told to wait.
---
Doesn't matter if he becomes a Strike Boss in one of the next ones, fact is he's a massive disappointment right now.
---
Seriously? Can’t see it on my small phone screen.
---
7/10 - points withheld for not presenting in the form of a Meme.  Good job, otherwise!
---
just showing for how long people have misjudged "more people = more productivity"
---
&gt;distracted with other projects
---
Anet as you said is 200 man strong so they are not "distracted" i think that gw2 actually gained a few devs compared to before. It would be stupid for anet not to have a new IP/Game in the works ill give you that.
---
What are Koodons? Are they in the Gem store by any chance? That’s where I was told you can purchase content. That’s the only way to get gold as well right? Because that’s how I got Eternity!
---
What's worse is I can't leave the strike mission if the boss has started. We wipe, I want to leave, they immediatly start the boss again and I am stuck for the next 5-10min
---
You must have never played many MMOs or never bothered to play ones that are story-focused like FFXIV \[cue the obligatory "actually, i did!!" comeback\].
---
I will admit however, that i loved that opening, especially since it was kinda clear what happened to Almorra \[even more so if you played/watched Aliens, Predator, etc\]. I liked the darker theme, the bodies of everyone that we could even check and see exactly how they died, the first sudden whisper of Jormag and Braham murmuring to himself more and more that this was ultimately his fault \[which, in a way, IT WAS when he left his guild to join us again\].
---
^ Did this person have a stroke while attempting to type their comment? The fuck am I reading?
---
You seem to imply ANet bothers to think that far ahead.
---
Boo. Upvote. Booo
---
u/angeleremite I'm curious what MMOs you've played now based off of your thread and title?
---
Yes. N.....
---
no u
---
Wait for the strike i guess?
---
Yeah sure sure, whatever you imagine. ;)
---
This is the same PR team that thought it was a good idea to rent out an entire theater (Something that has only been done for something as massive as the game's first expansion before) and hype up an entire announcement a week ahead just to sell us funko pops and hot topic tshirts.
---
Tl:dr
---
Won't read
---
I'm glad your so passionate about your hate. Have fun being a sad boy. I'm gonna go play games I enjoy. I recommend you do the same.
---
[It's intended](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/1101305/#Comment_1101305)
---
I'd love any type of guild content since all the missions etc is abandonware by now.
---
Ahhh ok, that makes sense indeed then that it is daily. I assumed they had messed up with the patch

Maybe ANET sucks at the game so badly that it's hard for them when they test it internally?
---
FOR THE ALLIANCE!
---
I actually don't mind FF marketboard at all, the only thing that genuinely pisses me off is the cunts that are undercutting me all of the time, but the nice thing about FF is that *listing* doesn't cost any fees, so I'm not suffering any penalties for merely attempting to sell something.

Raven Asura Gate Portal Package -2000 gems for unlimited use through these gates.

You expect GW2 players who are the casual players of pretty much all MMOs to press hotkeys?
---
And who made you the authority of what does and what doesn't belong into an MMO?
---
At this point Im not sure if breathing isnt too much for them
---
Where's the squirrel image from?
---
Ehh, I never took the saga being "better than the seasons" to mean that every release would be bigger, especially since they specifically said that the plan was to release content more frequently, but not necessarily in one big contained map like in previous seasons. This could mean expansions on current maps, content that builds upon itself, and expansion level content. That may mean that one month we may not get a new episode at all, but instead get something "expansion level" such as a new playable race (Kodan?), new elite specs, a new class, etc. 
---
I agree that this episode was quite short, but that doesn't mean that all releases in the entire saga will follow the same formula (since a formulaic approach was something they specifically said they wanted to get away from), or that we won't get expac level content in future releases.
---
Yes, of course, but this holds true nevertheless. The reason is irrelevant, but its a fact that the sub loses active members.
---
