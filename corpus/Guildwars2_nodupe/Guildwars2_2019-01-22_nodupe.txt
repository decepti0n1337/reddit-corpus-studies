The more they said about fan theories the more chance there was of them slipping up and saying something they shouldn't.  I'm honestly not surprised they refused to say very much in response to that portion of the interview.
---
did you know MMO's are often used in economics classes because they're really great self contained economic simulations that behave like real world economies? there's differences but the basic rules are the same.
---

---
i was talking about things like real life asset protection and resource scarcity. those are irrelevant...yes anet can remove peoples assets at any time...and all scarcity is artificial and can be corrected by anet at any time...
---
but they don't...they let this machine run itself... its the lifeblood of a game like this so they cant afford to toy with it on a whim without forethought.
---
Why? If they talk about it from that perspective, they're essentially speculating about their own story, and I don't see how that is productive. It's the fan's task to speculate about the story... 
---
That's just the nature of writing for MMOs, dude. Story the writers 100% intend to make it into the game sometimes gets cut for reasons totally beyond their control. Combine this with staff changes, time crunches, etc. and things can get lost. If it's enough to get you worked up over, you might need to take a break.
---
Yeah he literally started with "Dont bother mate. That stuff was fun to read but no way i am spoiling the coming story releases" before they even got into it.
---
Unfortunately not. I have done everything and all collections now besides for this one single achievement and the focus one that is also messed up.

Thank you!

Anet was bad at advertising their game then and they still suck at it now.

I'll echo the same stance I've had every time a subreddit dedicated to a specific game has a post saying "X aspect of the game doesn't belong here, put it in the dedicated sub"...
---
As the main, overarching Guild Wars 2 subreddit, *all* aspects of the game belong here. Discussions, achievements (first Legendary/Map Completion/etc.), fan art, character screenshots, erotica fanfics between the player character and the Elder Dragons... all of it.
---
The existence of a dedicated subreddit for a specific aspect of the game does not mean that aspect should not be welcomed on the main subreddit. Does the existence of /r/competitiveoverwatch mean that topics about Competitive and the OWL shouldn't be allowed on /r/Overwatch? Does /r/summonerschool mean that /r/LeagueofLegends shouldn't allow new players to ask for help?
---
If you don't like the screenshots of people's gear/dye jobs, no one is forcing you to look at them. Hide them, downvote them if you want. There may even be a way to hide them with the subreddit CSS (if they're flared properly).
---
Banning a certain type of content because it's too popular or "belongs somewhere else" doesn't tend to work out well. Just look at what happened the times they tried to ban/remove game highlights from /r/Overwatch. The sub dried up because there's just not that much to discuss on a day to day basis. Something like the proposed Show Off Sunday can be a good compromise.
---
**TL;DR -** As the main Guild Wars 2 subreddit, *all* content related to the game belongs here, even if a dedicated subreddit also exists. 
---
I know, it just reminded me.
---
You can have both accessible, and challenging raid content.
---
It's called difficulty modes, every other game with a healthy raiding mode has figured it out.

Man a lot of the people in this thread acting like DnT was super toxic are being more toxic than I've ever seen any member of their guild be. Yikes.

I think I'll do one run later before the patch hits a s a farewell.
---
The Black Lion Salvage Kit should be used when you have an exotic piece of equipment with a valuable Rune or Sigil in it.  You can use that Salvage Kit to extract the Rune/Sigil intact, letting you use it yourself or sell it on the Trading Post for a profit.  If you're unsure which Runes and Sigils are worthwhile, look them up on the Trading Post to check their prices.
---
The only soulbeast [build](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Soulbeast_-_Boon_Berserker) I run.
---
DnT stopped being a thing a long time ago, this is just an excuse to semi-disband the guild officially. Many players are still active in other guilds or look for attention in MightyTeapots streams.
---
I would take this seriously if they weren't focusing so much on themselves (or Nike wouldn't focus so much on himself rather).
---
Sure, raids have always been for a minority, even more so in GW2, a rather casual friendly game in open world, but right nw moore and more people are getting interested in raids and are loosing their fear.
---
At least the topic gets a bit more attention, although in a questionable manner.
---
Asura Females very very very rarely have consonants at the end of their names.  They almost always end in a vowel.
---
Whatever they'd say about those would be taken as a confirmation or denial by many around here. I'd say there's no good way about it.
---
&gt;&gt; what they should be focusing
---
Living world. And revamping old maps.
---
Didn't realize it was a month old, whoops.
---
Other than the meta builds, all of it is vetted. Not really sure where you get that info from, but you don't really seem to care what's truth or not as long as you get your vendetta across, so have fun with that.
---
I'm going to be downvoted for this, but I appreciate this experiment.  If it doesn't go well, so be it, but thanks for trying. There are other subreddits for art that are completely dead because people can get more clicks here, and I come here for discussion. I don't use the D&amp;D subreddit anymore either because it's just 100 posts of art and no discussion now. 
---
Yeah...I don't think that came from the bladder....on the other hand a new Taco Bell might have just opened in Tyria.
---
these goals are good; in terms of order-of-completion; they'll probably be done in this order:
---
1. full exotic gear
---
- Unlock Deadeye
---
- Griffon mount
---
- bad-ass armor skins, this could slot in anywhere in this list, as it is highly depending on what you consider bad-ass, and what getting those skins entails; it could be you need to complete a bunch of collections, it could be that you can buy most of these skins off the trading post, it could be you need to wait for gemstore skins to be back in rotation (and you have the gold/gems to buy them
---
^(For me bad-ass endgame gear for my Deadeye required a bunch of Dungeon running, GW1 achievements and LWS3 meta collections to complete the look I was going for.)

Though I feel like it would retain attention from people more if they decreased the time between the episodes/releases and had it more like a trickle-down effect.

I don't enjoy losing guilds. I enjoy losing douche attitudes like:
---
&gt; &lt;Guild Name&gt; has been, without a doubt, the greatest guild in the history of the game.
---
DnT members did great things for helping the community learn and git gud.  But self-proclamation of greatness serves no benefit other than to circle-jerk &amp; bait dissent.  And that's been Nike's M.O. any of the times I've bothered to pay attention.
---
ARE YOU ASSUMING MY GENDER?!
---
I just replied to another thread above with this same thought. I'm glad I'm no the only one to recognize that adding time gates to content just breaks up the community, which frankly is one of the biggest selling points of this game tbh. If I start logging in ti play and can't find anyone to run events with because they've all done their "daily run", I have no reason to continue playing the game.
---
Those boomboxes really don't count as musical instrument, no matter how Anet organises them.

In may belleh!!!! I think it stays lol while before disappearing. Less time than pve
---
it's all the same content anyway.
---
Fully agree, I work full time and once I get home the last thing I want to do is sit at another computer. So throughout the week I won't even pick up the daily chest, and then on the weekend where I'd love to pack in content in this game, it's like a 40 minute set of fractals, a couple dailies.. Then the rest of the time feels really ineffective.
---
I guess it's not a major issue for me since I never run Istan anyway, but I just wanted to throw my 2 cents in against the whole "daily" concept this game is steadily moving to. 
---
A generalization largely based on the early Asuran stories, but Taimi and her dynamic with Phlunt in Season 3 of living world is a great personification of this. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But even within their own schools Asurans are protective of their research.  Asuran society largely revolves around whose name is on an invention or research paper.  In fact, a big reason why some Asurans are drawn to the inquest is because they are they are the only organization that shares their research with eachother (in theory anyways).
---
I will add though that it's a little more complex than that. I've found that sometimes I would *still* take ages to find people when I set my LFGs to low KP requirements (like 30-50) or none at all, because all the "good people" want to find high KP groups so they skip over mine.
---
I wish it wouldn't be like this, but as people gather more and more KP they seem to stop wanting to associate themselves with lower KP / newbies. I have a friend who very much believes in asking for high KP, and his argument is "if you were matched with bronze players when you're in platinum ELO in a PvP game, wouldn't you also be annoyed?".
---
It's a mentality thing I guess. People who reach high KP are very often quite competitive if they have the motivation to get to that point, so they want to find others with a similar mindset and skill level for the smoothest and quickest run they can get, not necessarily just people who have enough KP to know the fight.
---
Wow. I knew GW2's Reddit community had a weird grudge against art, but this is way worse than I thought. This is making this sub so depressing... As an artist, I really feel spat on. I love seeing fanart of other people loving this game, it adds to my own passion of the game.
---
Just let the damned upvote system do its job. If the majority really wanted art off this sub, it would have all been downvoted to hell and beyond without anyone having to do anything.
---
Maybe I just don't notice it, but I don't remember ever seeing 7 out of 10 front page posts being about builds, raids, PvP, or WvW, except maybe on balance patch day. Hence the special treatment i guess.
---
I can't say I like the *Show off Sunday* idea as it's too exclusive, but I agree that when a kind of post ("art" or anything else) becomes too dominant it can be damaging for the subreddit and its population.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/actu90/aurora_need_to_be_transmutable/edbp1qk?utm_source=reddit-android
---
Just putting it out there in case anyone wants to to do this.
---
They all have the same functions. They all look different to each other. The raid armor is considered the "fancy" legendary armor and has the transforming effect. The WvW and PvP legendary armor is not as fancy and the skin is not exclusive to being a legendary, you can get it in ascended versions. 
---
They're all level 80 gear. The wiki page goes into lots of details on looks, acquisition, differences, etc. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Legendary_armor :) 
---
Tell me your account name or a character name and I'll send you a bell :)
---
They gave that episode away during the racing event
---
&gt;But let's be honest. We knew, in our heart. Fear not; the forums will not forget us. The posts we've gouged into it spell out our theories for all to see. 
---
Hey all! Back with another mount concept. I've had the idea for Lunar New Year mount skins since last year's event went by without a themed mount pack. I was sure we'd get one when both Halloween and Wintersday had sets. I originally planned to make them similar to the existing sets in-game, just slight modifications to existing models. As I worked on them I realized there was a lot of potential tying the different mounts to zodiac animals. While I have a few others in the works (rooster-raptor, anyone?) I wanted to share this pig themed roller beetle as 2019 is "Year of the Pig". Enjoy!

What you say is true but that doesn't stop people from wishing the game was more than a theme park. It really sucks because GW2 has hands down the best combat engine of any mmo but doesn't push the content where it truly shines.
---
tons of games are like that. That isn't a good reason
---
I appreciate your use of in-game dialog alongside your fleshing the scene out. Really fills in the gaps for me. Love it! 
---
Little known fact that I hope I am not banned for:
---
There is a seam in the EBG map on the cliff near blue spawn that takes you into a cave. A lot of weird and broken geometry. And, you guessed it, every loot bag _you’ve_ missed in WvW. It’s impossible to navigate, basically just have to spam pickup until full. But, may be worth looking into.
---
I love you for this 
---
Never pops for me.
---
I would like to know of this build please enlighten me (I have no idea what you are talking about)
---
Love your “penny dreadful”-esque thief
---
Yes but how would you make it with what is currently released, the more janky the better
---
You sure that's the best? Someone in-game told me it was Staff Weaver. 
---
I want to gear my Elementalist properly and I don't have too much gold to spare so I gotta make sure I get the right equipments.
---
Yea I bought the copper fed break down dude and that’s what I been using for everything. 
---
I think I’m gonna pick up the other one as well the rune one or what ever. 
---
The farm I was doing was on the island from the living story season 4 first chapter the one you get smuggled to. And I don’t think I made shit for an hour if that lol. 
---
I’ll be on the game in 3 hours if you are going to be around. But Ive been looking at builds on snow crow and I just wanna play everything lol 😂. The light legendary armor is my fav and 2nd is the heavy. So that’s also another goal I’ll be working on for sure! If you have discord go ahead and DM me it over reddit messages. Since I’ll be on there while I work. 
---
Definitely up to try this! If you donthis anytime at the start of next month please let me know :)
---
I wish this was actually true. Sadly it's not and that is why the scene died off. =( Even though Dungeons are incredibly fun and I love to do them last night I sat with my LFG up for 2 1/2 hours trying to find a group for various paths. I did more waiting than dungeoning since the dungeons I did get to do were over in less than 5 minutes.
---
..was it though? they could buff the newer metas instead, you know... the ones people never do..? 
---
What’s going on right now? Can someone inform me?
---
Thanks for posting this! That's the only reason I visit this sub! 
---
Here come the whiny doomsayers hyper inflating not a huge deal.
---
DEfine play the "whole game" If you're not doing the story, going for completion or farming a legendary, the hell is there to do on the game? sPvP is rigged, and WvWvW people do....for fucking legendaries lol
---
Ah, thanks! Thought it sounded something like that, appreciate the explanation.
---
I still run SW time to time, and you do the chests. But you only do them in the window after the boss and before the capture/defense events pop up. Also you can grab them while running to and from defense events.
---
" Our goal is for content like the Istan Metas to be a part of your daily play-cycle "
---
Okay, but why though?
---
 Every new piece of content you release works like this already. People will just flock back to the Silver Wastes, this doesn't solve anything, but makes things even more boring. This game needs a new Gold farm.
---
U could "craft" them in the Mystic Forge

Hey guys, I've been playing GW2 for 1 minute a week for 6 years and I wanted to share my greatest achievement, finding this lamp post.
---
I worked really hard  for  this  and  the has been magical. This community is so great how many lamp post have you seen?
---
Also I love quaggans and here is artwork I had commissioned of my character: UwU
---
Great right!
---
Click any unfinished mastery and the popup will stop happening. It's not a popup telling you to spend mastery points. It's a popup telling you that you're earning XP and failing to put it towards untrained an unfinished mastery. 
---
If you have no unfinished masteries, even if you still haven't spent mastery points for some of the ones you've finished, no popup.
---
By any reasonable interpretation, you owe me $1000USD.
---
Color me stupid.
---
No upcoming xpac anytime soon. No PvP updates since pof? No Wvw updates since pof? 1 raid since pof? Fractals?
---
They do almost ONLY maps and story since pof, including that expansion itself. And yet even those ls episodes and expansions are regularly delayed. 
---
Less and slower content, except for the gem store. No external content. No marketing. No communication other than anet stating we won't get an xpac anytime soon.
---
I'll let you figure it out yourself. 
---
Just kids gone mad.
---
I want to agree with you, but am afraid about being hauled off to some Centaur prison camp. Who would post my high quality gw2 memes while I am gone? No one.
---
Silverwastes going to be booming with people more than ever after this change O_O
---
Hello. I'd like to thank your derpy moa. Thanks. 
---
Doesn't matter. It'll be removed shortly along with the other drama shitposts.
---
Hmm...
---
T6 prices are about to skyrocket?
---
People getting up n arms over artwork, low effort memes and shit-posting.  One of the sub mobs made a little bit of a joke and did some censoring and some small portion of the community seems upset about it.  The other portion is just pushing the drama for entertainment. 
---
Naw they've done that since S3 LS. You can only farm so many nodes of currency in many of those maps. Only a couple are "unlimited"
---
Mods are right, you're wrong. No memes is the second rule under "Please do not" in the sidebar.
---
&gt; Seriously.
---
I guess you router got a new ip when you restarted it. That's why the game ask for authentication.
---
It's normal and can happen. No worries
---
&gt; my internet connection suddenly died

Your router got a different IP address. Move along. Nothing to see here.

I'm newb.  (well returning vet who has barely played in the last 5 years) What happened to the economy?
---
this is the most butt blasted I have ever seen someone in this community, and I was here for JP and HoT's launch.
---
&gt; Given their magical bond, you could argue that Caithe felt the loss of Aurene more profoundly than anyone
---
Well, she did describe every emotion of Aurene post-bonding as "overwhelming" or synonyms of it. I'm sure that the emptyness left behind will be just as superlative.
---
Long overdue.  
---
But on the bright side, the salty tears in these comments completely fulfill my expectations.
---
There were more viewers for gw2 streams in the past. There's merit to having an active content community around the game. 
---
&gt; repeatable content not hitting full potential because ~~of the oddity that is LFG~~ *I haven't found or created a decent guild*.
---
FTFY
---
Hey, I don't have much time to play GW2, no need to be such an elitist. UwU
---
I agree with this only because I'm a returning vet and I haven't done a lot of metas simply cuz people aren't doing them. And I'd love to do them just for the fun of it!
---
Here, check (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g7zlH3pVPvW21WIh5-qL-IXDeABtJzIqnZYXP8tCcM0/edit?usp=drivesdk)[this guide]

Except for if you don't get to play when its prime time. And then you're stuffed. I don't know where timezone your 4am is. But at 4am my time (3 am pst) it takes a lot of effort to even find a squad for TD or DS, even AB. It's problematic and annoying. I actually spent most of my time after fractals in Istan because there was people there doing it and the couple hours I get a day were actually worth it.
---
Top-tier shit post.
---
Then why are some of the most upvoted  posts on this subject low-quality memes?
---
Ah, makes sense. But not sure why it never happened before, even when router was restarted. Well thanks!

It's not a matter of opinion. They buffed them a long time ago. People just never went back. 
---
So they nerf Istan, but meanwhile Domain of Kourna is complete trash and unrewarding.
---
ive got a question for anet, why is it that we are always there when killing dragons/gods but we never absorb any of their power? basically feel like the same weakling since the start of guild wars 2
---
about aurene? didnt actually care since anet has a bad habit of bringing characters back and i feel its gonna happen again
---
I'm likely going to open my wallet less after this change, and just adjust to farming something else instead: I don't approve of the many new forms of time-gating that ANet is starting to rely too heavily on, between that and raiding, I'm not liking the new priorities that ANet is falling behind. I was quite happy to whale around at one point, but that's not happening anytime soon. 
---
As a player whose hours are not at peak time, Istan was a way to still socialise and earn gold with a bunch of people, and as someone who's both chronically ill AND the sole caretaker for himself and his also-disabled sweetie, I can only sign in when I can sign in, and that means I can't have a regular raiding or fractal schedule. Between Living World updates, my limited time has been doing dailies and farming istan.
---
A lot of people are gloating, but why? There are other farms that are almost as lucrative, but it's this one that's resulted in a lot of bitching. Why is my time less important than anyone else's, or my way of playing such a problem? I don't get to wind down for a few hours playing my favorite game anymore, congratulations for blowing that up! 
---
Id suspect the game names have been trademarked.
---
Ik real life place names are often used as code names for products because those names aren't (and usually can't be if it's an official place) be trademarked.
---
*This is heavy*.
---
What are the most cost efficient foods / utility items that add the most Power and Magic find. I know there are ones for raids, but they are expensive. I want the most efficient for a berserker build in PvE while I do open-world content. Thanks!
---
It's quite possible that they play at off peak times, where it is relatively slower to find groups
---
This is flawed reasoning. The reason gw2 is now heavily casual is because all other aspects of the game have had much less development for 6+ years. Yes, open world was there at the start but so were flourishing guilds, speedrunners, wvw, PvP, ... and many of those comminities died due to neglect while the casual end got regularly. 
---
Without marketing or players marketing for them, I don't see gw2 grow or even replace those that quit. Do you?
---
It's an attempt at containing the flood to 1 day only.
---
I’m not saying to appreciate them. I’m just saying that there is potentially a logistical reason for so many loose ends in the story. It’s difficult to go back and resolve storylines from past writers, especially if they were contract and left little to go on. It’s even more difficult if the focus of the company is solely on going forward and not addressing the holes in the story. 
---
THe problem with the sentiment though is that in order for them to be even remotely worthwhile doing over almost anything else is the ability to actually get a group together and do them. See, it can be the most profitable thing in the game, but if no one does it your g/h is still low. It takes (on average and without merging/glitching pathes) approx. 2 hours to do all dungeon explorable paths in the game which would give you a lot of currency, gold (10g and 200 bonus currency just from the achievement), and mats. Which would be easily doable and probably is for someone who has a static group that knows what to do and what order to run in. But, without that it takes upwards of 3-4 hours for the SAME rewards when having to find multiple groups for every dungeon. Thus making it not worth it. It's not a matter of opinion, it is math and facts. If others don't do it, 1 person cannot. And as someone who would do it every day if I could find 4 others to do it with, I just can't on my own even if I can solo some of the paths.
---
Read about it a little more closely, then.  It was one word, was years ago, taken entirely out of context, and was done no where near Patreon and not even on his own channel.
---
If you're okay with that, then congrats.. Orwell's 1984 is here, and in full force.
---
Not really.
---
There's a new Salvage Kit that is marginally better than the copper Fed, but buying it when you already own the copper Fed is kind of a waste.
---
Honestly removing art is like the subreddit equivalent of "banning raid sellers from LFG will make more raid LFGs". Content won't appear because you are moving it.

They won't believe until it happens no matter how obvious.

---
I would love to have a complete machine styled mounts like your Asuran Skimmer one.
---
Honestly even for games bigger than is having split subreddits almost never works out.
---
I seriously have to ask... if you have different subreddits or assigned days for everything, what exactly do the mod team visualise this subreddit actually consisting of for the majority of the time? There's only so many times we can rehash 'Gosh, wasn't that last LW episode something special?' or 'Gosh, wasn't that last LW episode something awful?' before the sub dries out completely. Before long all that will be left is long, angry rant threads about [insert incrementally nerfed feature here] or [perception of a certain class being OP on a certain encounter or game mode].
---
It just seems that whenever something gets banned or corralled, the only result is that something else becomes the flavour of the day, people complain how there's too much of it, so it gets removed as well, and then the cycle repeats. It's just that eventually we're going to run out of things to post. The majority of users, I suspect, don't come here for what you count as 'valuable' discussion. Those posts have a place here, of course, but as a fan community this subreddit largely revolves around fan-created works, be they art, music, videos, screenshots, what have you. I for one will have almost no interest in visiting the subreddit if this change goes through.
---
Haha, upvoted. That's one of my qualms for a lot of medium chest pieces, but I guess we have to work with what we've got. The bottom half expands and shrinks unnaturally with breathing in some animations and is all around sloppy for clipping issues. Nevertheless, the theme for musketeers may actually do well with some flowy tabards and tunics.

Possible? Sure. Practical? Probably not.
---
"And we wanted Aurene’s version of Branding—something much more beautiful and harmonious than Kralkatorrik’s violent subjugation—to connect them with a new level of intimacy that would let Caithe function as a lens into Aurene’s deeper nature"
---
Whether or not Aurene comes back, I really hope that the theme of 'magical connection can be a good thing' to continue. We've seen the bad- every elder dragon subjugates their minions as slaves, the nightmare court forcing people to nightmare, even the Pale Tree pressuring the Sylvari into never cutting themselves off from the dream- but rarely have we seen this portrayed as a consentual and beautiful thing. And it's quite fun to think about the nuance here. With Jormag, for instance, haven't we heard that control is freely given?
---
It's incredibly obvious to pretty much anyone. I didn't know *why* my characters look better on the login screen, but I do know that when I'm asking my boyfriend "which dye looks better on my ele" i snap the screenshots from the login screen
---
Old player here! Coming from late 2016!   
---
How is the community today? I recently picked up ESO and GW2 comes and goes from mind. Wondering how lively the game is since.

Tybalt, recap

Yes, commander.

Oh thank you very much, I play as an asura named Baphis
---
Well, there are no perks but the quality of matches changes drastically when you move from Silver to Gold. Improving in any ladder situation is a challenge, and pushing yourself to improve your mechanics and rotations is a goal everyone should have.

My dps pvp build on weaver ele Sw/f

Not to rain on their parade, but any reasonable person would realize 6 raid wings a year wasn't feasible. Back when I still played WoW during its heyday (during vanilla/BC/wotlk), even blizzard never managed 6 raid wings a year (to be fair, blizzard raids *are* huge and mechanically challenging). I play FF14 every now and then, and *they* don't do 6 raid wings a year - they do 4 savage bosses every 6 months (they alternate that with casual easy 24man raids and an ex primal every 3 months that is honestly at middling difficulty at best), and those bosses are not actual "dungeons" with mobs and places to explore, they are literally arenas where SE essentially throws you into a room with the boss (no trash mobs or anything) and says "have at it". Say what you like about gw2's raids - as easy as they might be - they are beautiful designed areas.
---
Ah ha! The Cardinal's sacred snack chamber.
---
&gt;It won't let me for a skin
---
Means it's already unlocked. And yeah zenith / hellfire / radiant achievement skins are special, you can apply as many as you want with no transmute cost from the wardrobe or achievement panel
---
It's not just the breakbar, the twin legendary fight is terribly done. Copious amount of  invulnerability, and tons of KB and AoEs, it's the anti-thesis of fun. The entire meta needs a rework .
---
[This](https://github.com/kytulendu/Gw2Browser) is probably the most up to date tool that might fit your needs off the top of my head. You'll need to look up how to convert the files into mp3 as well.
---
This is amazing :D
---
The only way raids have been cost effective in any game was to make easy raids and throw the elitist crowd a bone with optional hard modes. 90% of players couldn't care less about the heart pumping adrenaline of wiping to bosses, they just want a large group experience and to see cool content. Having no matchmaking or casual modes is ridiculous in the current market.
---
Back to SW until he next broken map will be released and nerfed a few months after that, back to SW and so on.
---
Pffah, Eir never fought a Mouth of Zhaitan. For the first one, she was too busy suiciding it up in Honor of the Waves. For the second, she was too busy with the rest of DE mourning "Logan's loss" in the back of an airship! ;P
---
I love Rytlock's thumbs up near the end.
---
I dunno about out of date, there's certainly a market for hard games still...
---
You don't have to spend any mastery points. Just keep filling available mastery tracks. The popup only happens when you have a mastery track that is available and unfilled.
---
You still owe me $1000USD.
---
This is a really stupid idea. Flair posts with fashion and let individual cry babies filter themselves. This game has often laughable content updates every three months, there isn't shit to discuss most the time and without filler this sub will be dead. 
---
It says the name isn't used, can you tell me your account name with the 4 numbers at the end?
---
Don't confuse raiding with "endgame" That's other games. This game had end game before raids. Different people in this game have vastly different end games.
---
I agree that raids aren't coming out fast enough to support the raiding community but for my end game, there's plenty that comes out. You just have a different end game.
---
Lotto has better odds

Looked through my old screens and found [Overly Attached Kiel](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a015cdf8574785aeab3d15b9c90df921/tumblr_n2b0mgwdQc1sixt4jo1_1280.jpg) too
---
At least we could look good, while doing the same old shit. Isn't that the core essence of GW2 Endgame? /s
---
Sorry, this sub doesn't allow art on a weekday. Delete this.
---
/s
---
We get a couple hours of content every three months what are people expecting ongoing discussion on? 
---
Boy, do I have a spoiler for GW:Nightfall. ;)
---
I think the biggest issue is money. It takes a TON to create a new engine, or upgrade an old one, as well as numerous workers NOT working on more important things ,such as living world episodes. 
---
Add more people to it? Even more money.
---
So just expect optimizations from time to time
---
R u looking to support or deal some damage? Either way I'd recommend power chrono. U deal great damage and it's good when u pug for fractals. Sadly there is no one build to do everything. If u wanna gear your character in full ascended then fractals would be a good start. Chrono is a complex class and it's better to understand your class first. U can always ask good players on the snowcrows discord server. Good luck!
---
Who's "we"?  LOL, look at you, hovering over reddit.  Can I come back to the discord pretty please with sugar on top?
---
Nobody's leaving raids because the game's too casual, it's from the content drought because the raids are ridiculously exclusive and nobody plays them. Enjoy your dead game mode because you didn't want any casuals in your super cool sandbox.
---
You can obviously still craft them too.
---
It sounds and looks to me as though your sample size when first conducting the idea was relatively small and thus no indication of an actual statistical value. 
---
For future changes it might be good to have a pinned front page thread like this for intelligence gathering BEFORE deciding on a particular course of action.
---
While I don't agree with the grim outlook of some commenters here (GW2 being on the verge of death/life support in one year and a half or in two years... wtf?!), I'm convinced in ten years the game will indeed have told all of the story it wanted to tell. It will have finished the overarching Elder Dragon arc and released four or even five expansions overall. The playerbase will be smaller by then, but a number of players will stay around for as long as the game is online and form guilds to brave open world metas.
---
I also think that they will be able to make the amount of changes that they need to make to keep this game in the run until it is all done from their side. Player retention will be the bigger problem, as people move on to more modern projects of a 2022+ standard.
---
Will GW2 still receive graphics updates in 10 years? No, I agree with others here that a sequel or an MMO in a new setting is all the more probable. 
---
Wait, is this including “Commander, Yes!”??? I’d rather that one be allowed whenever, otherwise it could be buried in the art spam of Sunday!
---
They say whenever someone posts about legendary armor bamboozling he'll appear to give an upvote!
---
Also he's on TeaTime occasionally. 
---
Salt #1
---
Players shouldn’t run the same meta more than twice a day just for the optimal rewards. They can do so if they feel like it, but I think the best case scenario is one in which players are constantly changing maps and doing different activities for best rewards.
---
Expansions don't affect leveling in any way (except lifting restrictions). I'd say level up and see if you like the game, buy expansions when you get close to max level.
---
People used to stream fractals and dungeons but we don't talk about the latter anymore. 
---
I am using the sniper build here: http://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Soulbeast_-_Sic_%27Em_Sniper
---
Unranked, just playing around mostly for dailies and reward tracks.
---
Hey look, those also never gained traction because they were poorly tuned and way too hard for regular players. Turns out everything made for the "hardcore" screeching elitist demographic turns to ash, universally, across the entire industry.
---
During the time your modem was off, another came online and was issued the IP you originally had. Unless you're paying for a static IP address, the IP from the ISP is dynamic, and can change (theoretically) any time the IP 'lease' expires and the modem requests a renewal of the IP 'lease'.
---
Makes me think Istan meta will be heavily dead during my playtimes. Since everyone will knock it out asap, then have no need to go back.
---
Raids were never going to work in the most casual mmo in the market that struggles to get hours of content out every few months and balances four times a year. 
---
Best case scenario is players are incentivized to do a little bit of everything, and visit multiple maps a day. If your entire daily activity is repeating one or two activities, then there’s a problem. Personally, I think various meta events (Triple Trouble, Serpent’s Ire) need a buff to rewards for doing it once daily for just this reason.
---
Looking for the same
---
Thanks! Yes I did spent a few golds to buy all berserker gear, green trinkets+rings+necklace, yellow armor, and exotic weapons. Gonna do some dungeon for full exotic armor and then proceed to Fotm.
---
I don't know if you were I'm just commenting on your post that made you sound like a petulant 2 year old "It's my birthday put me back in the group". You were thrown out for a reason and it must have been a good one that you didn't get added back so grow up and go find another guild.
---
I see now. Thanks for in depth explanation.
---
oh man you're so nice, thanks :D
---
*Sweet nightmares are made of these ♪♫*
---
gz! now you have lvl 80 pure dps gear on all equipment and weapons. Slap some marksmanship / skirmishing /beastmastery and youre ready to take the world.
---
Stats wise it doesnt get better than this. You COULD seek out ways to get ascendant gear and get around 5-10% more stats but ill let you decide if its worth the time/gold.  
---
Another thing to seek is a great rune /sigil set. Runes have been updated recently and bring quite a pack of stats and effects.
---
As a ranger you can also charm pets. Get your self some great pets, or catch 'em all!
---
Like i said, stats wise theres not much you can do. Gw2 doesnt really have any sort of gear grind, a lvl 80 exotic set will bring you a long way. However high lvl fractals do require a lot of ascendant gear only cause it has infusion slots for agony resistance infusions needed inside high lvl fractals
---
To be honest, and I can't speak for anyone else of course, but my biggest issue with Serpent's Ire, despite the fact that I deliberately take as much CC as possible in to it, is that the brandstorm combined with massive amounts of particle effects from skills and the event itself causes my framerate to fuck off and die (to be fair I have not tried it since I upgraded to a better computer, but I was getting 2-3 FPS in that part of the game during that event, and that part only.  Next worst drop was in WvW full zergs and that was still in the 20s), so good luck even seeing the defiance bar in the first place to know if it's time to break it.
---
Shave a bit of time off when the bandit chest spawns far away, or to hop down a ledge and then port back up
---
Good idea. I don't think that we should aim for quantity over quality. I am ok with quality art posts staying, but all the cheap attention grabbing needs to go elsewhere or be heavily limited.
---
It's not like you gather all day every day to make them worth and there's vendors everywhere. You'll need other upgrades much more than gathering tools, assuming you need them at all.
---
Use the build on godsofpvp and practice Your mechanics and matchup.
---
You 1 shot them from stealth just like they do. Mesmer is so overtuned at the moment that it's laughable. Wouldn't every class like to be invincible for 20 seconds straight not including stealth and ports and de-targeting among others. . . 
---
No, I think the name is Labirintine cliffs, the one used for the seasonal event "Festival of the four winds"
---
Trying to farm karma off of WP's video?
---
Her drugs is bad relationships anyway. 
---
About 250 an episode, discounted as a bundle.
---
For Season 2, this seems a bit steep to me. For 3 and 4 this seems about right, as there is a *lot* of content.
---
I tell knew players to think of it as a 3rd, PvE only expansion. Together it has more PvE content than either of the expansions and costs about the same.
---
I do wish they'd just make 2 free with HoT at the end of 4 though. It's old enough now.
---
Weary stare.
---
Buff of what? Twice of green items, nice buff.
---
I'm gonna have to load up OBS and save $950USD after I school ya
---
Which is fine by me, as long as we get to keep her. I don’t want to lose another one of destiny’s edge. Bums me out enough that eir is dead and zojja is a potato
---
Thread removed: Duplicate post, please check the recent posts for a similar one and use that. This includes making a comment post about a another post.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
I take no responsibility here... *leaves quickly*
---
If you're playing the longbow/gs build, your best bet is to surprise them and kill them while they're engaged with something else. If they get on you, you should probably kite or run, until you get a good opportunity to turn back and kill them in one burst. 
---
One thing I can tell you, you shoudl probably create a mesmer and look throught their skills and traits to understand a bit better where their clones comes from, and what each do. You seems a bit new with how you describe them, it would help you quite a lot. 
---
I dated a girl who looked like that once...
---
Not only was it dramatic but it was surprising.  It was surprising in the sense that I didn't expect something to happen so quick as usually there is a bit more build up before something like that happens.  I expected at least 1-2 more episodes before something major would happen story wise and then a week later some kind of big announcement from Anet to start up LW5.
---
i like captain's airship pass over Mistlock Sanctuary Passkey because all is still pretty closely stacked but has fewer players there with all their "noise". The only real upside would be porting back to your original position but you can just use WvW Sanctum for this as well
---
These days my fragments come from LWS3 currency farming and my obsidian comes from the karma merchant in Orr.  The karma itself comes from Istan though I guess after the farm gets nuked I'll need to cut back a good bit.
---
Pretty much... or map complete.
---
thank you!
---
there is no way i could have figured out kasmeer and braham.
---
taimi is the best here lol
---
Open world wise both are pretty strong subclasses with good dps and good selfbuffs.
---
In WvW necro is better for running in zerk and thief better for roaming.
---
For Fractal necro is simply to weak to be worthwhile for serious groups, while thief still have solid dps.
---
In raids thief can choice between 2 good dps builds while necro is mostly played as secondary heal and dps for 1-2 bosses for epi
---
Glad I'm not the only one who loves the Bladed Boots! 
---
&gt;gameplay
---
&gt;solid ocean
---
pick one
---
IIRC Exotics ie Precursors only drop in Gold Chest, Steel Chests are Rare.
---
In general are tier 1 fractals be done with only 3 players? I'm using [http://gw2dungeons.net/](http://gw2dungeons.net/) to look out for specific fractals that with mechanics that require more than 3 but I've not found any (I've only read the first 10 or so)
---
He’s not wrong, as a mesmer/thief myself, mesmer is extremely overtuned, especially compared to thief, which fills a similar role in sPvP.
---
It’s mainly because most mesmer players have victim complexes and scream at every nerf they get 10x louder than other classes.
---
As my friend says “when your skills are pink, nobody expects you to fight fair”
---
Can confirm grinding gold sucks. 
---
Bought 250 gold in gem store for $12.50 during annual sales exchange peak. No regret. 
---
Send me $1k and I'll fill it up for you no problem.
---
i dont understand how people could like and play a charr and your comics help me relate to that.
---
they showed me a fun side of GW2 that i didnt know existed.
---
Don't forget Scarlet, who severed herself from the Dream.
---
Damn, these cabbages really don't have a lot of good options. 
---
Who?
---
Because they cover the same niche as fractals which do gain attention. Raids need a story mode before you'll see them focused on because there's no benefit in putting hundreds of hours into all these fancy new zones and enemies. All the voice acting and story writing. When a minuscule fraction of the player base will ever touch it or see it. 
---
Yup.  I raid weekly with a training group in my guild.  I wouldn't mind doing more/different raid content, but not if it means putting up with assholes.  Punishing content, fine.  Punishing personalities?  Nope.
---
It's not like I don't want to, it's more of I can't. 
---
I don't really have time to relax or do anything for myself. I am working for more hours than normal human should be just because my boss is constantly fucking workers and government on taxes. On paper I have the lowest salary available in my country, everything else goes "under the table". Then, for example let's say that you have driving license exam, and you need a day off. They will give you it, but you will get only the amount of money that's on paper for that day.
---
I am working ~14 hours a day plus Saturdays just to bring enough cash to feed my family and be able to pay the bills. There's no place to move to get better job, because you need money to move to get more money. Educating myself? Money. Can't afford almost anything these days. I wish I had a chance to change the way I live, but it seems so distant.
---
Last time I had a time on my hands I made a mobile game hoping I get just a little revenue out of it. But without advertising it just disappeared in endless pit of Google play store apps.
---
So it's not like I am sitting here, accepting my life. There are attempts to fix it. But nothing works so far.
---
Is there a TIFU reddit but rather for whole life choices IFU? :v
---
how do you cry underwater lol? :D
---
your expressions are GOLD.
---
Anet seems to think the existing content and CMs are fine.  That approach works for fractals but apparently doesn't cut it for raids.
---
[So is toast.](https://www.cancer.org/latest-news/coffee-and-cancer-what-the-research-really-shows.html)
---
Ack!
---
The real problem for me is that GW2 lacks of linear progress as in end game. I really didn't farm istan or sw a lot, I just used my card if I really wanted something. But after getting my toons fashioned up, with legendaries, I have nothing else to do. I do daily fractals and that's about it.
---
I just wish there would be some kind of grind I can do that would somehow strengthen my toon, like giving higher magicfind chance or something. (you know, something that's not p2w style but buffs the rewards or something) And I want all sort of farming in 1 map would die.
---
Raiding only overlaps with the true endgame (fashion wars) if you need a skin sourced from raids to finish your character's look.
---
Classical shit argument by a player that has not a clue. A guild does not mean you will have player online when you are online that still dont have t4 and cm
---
ye dude, except in this living story season you actually talked to a god who used to be human
---
"Everything has unfolded as I knew it would"
---
Glint will not shut the fuck up to me. I would love some new lines. Kalla on the other hand is silent :(
---
Indistinguishable from any raider in LA map chat.
---
Its eu.. And  no. Not to picky
---
wait, Zojja is a potato in the sense that she does fuck all, right?
---
not brain dead?
---
did i miss something?
---
Man... I understand you! Same here. Not as bad tho. Have a few hours to play here and there, but not as much as use to. Things changed after I got a kid. 
---
Hope you'll find better job some time! Situation you're in is no fun! Been there done that! 
---
U can see what you mean, but dnd has been primarily a story telling game and character designs aren't as important. Gw2 on the other hand is very customization oriented game, where fashion is an endgame type of content. Art is just a celebration of the individuals character and their endgame look.
---
Fortunately we aren't being spammed just yet, and people who draw character art regularly dont post here all the time.
---
Dude we were two yesterday and we searched for anything. I did not care so long the fucking Group filled. We waited 30mins +
---
All the people here are rendering this teyt into something completely false. That I am doijg wrong but its not true and its why this game will die. We cant have nice things over and out
---
Not sure if I upvote or downvote.
---
Fractals are casual and cm is too if you reached that level as a casual its quite doable if just the LFG system would work on Eu... Wtf
---
Idk how anyone can defend Mirage. That class is both broken and extremely unhealthy for the game. 
---
It's pretty much a troll class by design and a class designed to cause player frustration should never be meta in any game.
---
Willful ignorance...that's how.
---
Is this PvP focused? I'm confused, because I thought mirage was considered weak? I also find my Weaver and guardian are much much stronger than my mirage (open world pve focused)
---
you recommendet a k cpu with a h mainboard. Thats a waste of money.
---
100% never touch the easy modes in those games. However, I enjoy challenges.
---
I'm late, but I wanted to share this build I've been using for casual open world/dungeons/fractals. It's by no means optimized, but I've found it very fun. 
---
http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vVAQNAW3ensADFBjFCBeCBEEhF9BbvjOSXpVBgk04yaCcu+TA-jxiAQBXSNB0o8LaHBgOpSCAOIA2c/BL+AAWkuh+dBAgkSQSpKBpA8bwG-e
---
You're not minority. I do, too. And it promotes discussion, so I don't know what's going on with people and the mods. It was never against the rules nor is it doing any harm. Not any more than people downvoting every goddamn post that isn't part of the daily/weekly circlejerk.
---
This.
---
Sure it gets to be mindless and boring after you've done it a few hundred times, but that's no failing on the maps part.
---
Also SW is an excellent stepping stone from core Tyria to the expansion regions. We could use another intermediate step, imho, between SW and the desert, but this is what we've got, and in that role, it does a great job of transitioning between core Tyria and its world bosses, and the metas that you find in the jungle.
---
The only easy change that might make it better would be a "desperate defense" phase, where the mordrem hit all 4 forts at once, just before breach, forcing the map to split up between the bases. Maybe even have each base attacked with a different style of attack (husks, teragriffs, trolls, and thrashers?).
---
Like Teq, it'd cascade in the players' favor, since one fort knocking out it's attackers would free up those players to aid the rest, but that's a good thing as well.
---
After all 4 are secure, then start breach.
---
[obligatory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROiid4RpLUI)
---
Depends how the date went. 
---
Please don't... They'd have to rework the whole system and I'm pretty sure no one(besides you, I guess) wants to have instabilities in dungeons. Even if they'd be seperate from actual dungeons.
---
something like viper but dropping precision for ferocity. hybrid reaper would be a thing... maybe.
---
or perhaps open ALL the paths up at once, make them a guild related event that gives not only new loot but drops decorations and such themed around the dungeon, two birds with one stone
---
Dude, Jawgeous was literally just pointing out that mesmer skills do way too many things, some of which don’t even make sense for the skill. He frequently points out the small details of each skill that really don’t need to be there.
---
Also, mesmer is the best class in PvP, hands down. As in, you can replace pretty much any class in the game with some form of mesmer build.
---
And also almost every meta mesmer build is going to automatically have an advantage in 1v1s. Condi mirage is a joke it’s so oppressive.
---
I know this because I peaked 1650 as thief after 2,000 games. Season after I switch to condi mirage and break my peak easily within 30 games. Now I play condi mirage in sPvP, and I’m basically untouchable except against occasional SD thieves.
---
In WvW I have a K/D of like 15.0 roaming on mirage. Last night I won a 1v3 against a necro, ranger, and ele. It’s just insane what you can do with the class.
---
[Glorious!](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/BonySaltyIndochinahogdeer-size_restricted.gif)
---
It's way more than "a bit of rework and balancing". Dungeons are just mazes of different dialogue/spawn trigger points, tied to NPCs/players reaching certain areas etc. Then you get multiple paths in the same instance all with their own scripts in the same areas. Then there's the countless bugs preventing progress when an NPC gets aggro at the wrong time, you trigger events too quickly, you kill a boss to quickly, you let an NPC die, you're too slow, etc etc.
---
Basically all the paths would have to be remade from the ground up, besides the sound/graphics assets. This would be a very large amount of work for content that's been in the game and always accessible since launch and thus isn't "new and exciting".
---
God, it's hardly the plot to the next star wars film lol
---
Maybe, but we'll have to see how things turn out.. considering people can still farm the champs during Amala
---
Funny how some people get mad and say they didn’t watch Jawgeous video but here y’all are not watching any of these videos that breakdown what was wrong with his video🤷🏻‍♂️☕️
---
Can this be applied to the rest of the metas?
---
Not sure how to feel about this as someone who farmed the crap out of Istan though. On one hand it’s nice only having to due one run but I’m not sure how the profits going to be now.
---
Remember to keybind, youtube it
---
Why does that have relevance though? Simon Cowell isn't a singer, yet he critiques them. I mean, I'm assuming you aren't an actor yet I'm sure you've criticised someone's performance in a  movie before?
---
The newest map has some thunderhead culling issues too. I will see the branded boss for a second but then it will just go invisible again.
---
Nah I'm with you. I think screenshots are fine. 
---
My issue is people who'd make multiple screenshot posts, hell even of the same character, to get individual karma. That floods subreddits. However, it's really hard to filter out because the moderation menu/automoderator literally can't look out for those things. So you can't really stop it without disallowing screenshots and media altogether.
---
What people aren't understanding is how shitty reddit filters are. Like, it doesnt work on mobile AT ALL and it can only filter some if not one on desktop. Moderation and filtering for easy usage on this site is really annoying, even with a handful of programmers on the mod team, you cant really do too much with reddit.
---
nothing new. they nerfed tarir while ago, now its time for istan, u must wait for new profitable meta soon, as they always did before.
---
personally i dont rly care, i stopped playing about 8 months ago i think, and i dont wanna get back. i left cause game became too boring - daily fractals, daily crafts, afking in mystlock and doing nothing.
---
on the bright note SW will get more players now, thats good for me  since i farmed sw a lot. for g/h.. well, anet too stupid too touch my ways of making gold. /shrug
---
or a mod removed it
---
Looks kind of spiky.
---
Almost like some kind of hedge-pig.
---
Ok now this is epic
---
Axe/warhorn druid is pretty effective at killing Mesmers because axe clears clones easily. Druid is great because of condi clears and CA skills. The downside of this build is poor mobility from losing sword mainhand. 
---
I main core guard now and this class is much better at being a hard counter to mesmers. Tonnes of cleave, condi clear, stability AND spike damage to boot. 
---
Rip the double palas, good times.
---
Yess, the re-friending Braham scene I wanted.
---
It's no better or worse than any other MMO with a pvp mode IMO. You'll come across some real scum but you'll also find some really nice people
---
Well, that was because of a "gift" that was given to mortal Kormir by the 5 gods just prior to confronting Abaddon.
---
"I hope they stick to this arrangement"--- Me and others enjoy it so fuck the rest who has other interests? Ahh, I see.  
---
The decision was made way back and not just right before that 6 years video.  
---
It doesnt emerge over night. Again: Missed the point. But good try.  
---
To be clear: I dont get the fact how you can be so out of the loop of your company to even say sth like that. And then dont even deliver sth remotly similar.
---
Same , and the downvote comment is spot on too. People are crazy with that downvote button here.
---
Just wanna add that out of season Unranked is kind of a clown fiesta because exp and inexp players are queueing together. I’ve been in Unranked matches that are as intense as High Gold matches lol. 
---
Once season starts, exp players with flock to ranked games for the lucrative rewards leaving Unranked to mostly newbies or players testing new builds. 
---
Is that Bean from even stevens?

There is a trans NPC in lions arch. Her name is Sya she is near the stairs north of the Mist Portals.
---
This can only go so far to reach how they want people to play the game. As noted in the post they want people to have some sort of daily rotation of content. The issue here is that there is so much of this nobody can do all of it, so people only do the most profitable things in the game. This leaves certain events empty, and as new content is added the problem only gets worse.
---
I don't know how they could go about fixing this.
---
its GP/H actually isnt bad, quit sperging
---
All 3 gamemodes are good.
---
Every raid boss gives 2 gold + newest + a random wing has a buff which doubled gold, so those give 4. + extra loot
---
I would but they are so expensive (10 times of rare), plus i am afraid i may burn out quickly if i get to the semi-goal so quick, thats why I decided to do dungeons first, and buy exotics with dungeon tokens. If it turns out to be much of a grind / too hard to find party, I may just buy a full exotic set from TP like you said.
---
Looks like butch from sense8
---
I struggled too. I guess good thing is you can get portal spikes done and fail jets if your low on numbers.
---
I found you had to be proactive and shout in map and put up lfgs. Good luck!!!
---
So your proof that Mirage is not overtuned is that players who are really good at Rangers and Engy can kill any noob Mirage. 
---
How is that even a argument? 
---
The spreadsheet hasn't been updated in quite a while, but yeah it can be upwards of 30-50g per hour depending on available recipes and tour speed. Especially for people who don't have recipes, rising ecto and mat prices are good for dungeons
---
When you don't realise you want something until you see it...
---
I have a similar problem, not as big but still very unplayable for me. In the morning (I'm from central Europe) I am sitting around 50 but in the evening (prime time) I always end up with ping 120-130 which is like a 1-2 second delay and pretty unplayable at that point...dunno if it's my internet or the servers. Can't do any WvW on prime time rip =(
---
So, trying to not be a burden to your own group by doing no dps is somehow bad? 
---
All you had to do is spend a few hours on the golem to learn your rotation. No one is stopping you from doing raids than yourself if you don't want to practice just a little bit before even trying.
---
I fundamentally disagree with this. If you attempt to hinder any posts on this sub, you will only help towards making it more barren. I agree with other comments stating upvotes and downvotes already help to choose what goes on the front page of this subreddit.
---
My biggest disagreement is hindering memes. I like memes on this subreddit because they don't happen extremely often. This means when something happens to the game that creates a whole bunch of memes, they're usually hilarious and make me smile. By saying some of the meme posts might be removed you are denying the subreddit one of the very few memes it gets.
---
There is no such thing, you have to be specialized.
---
Imo Meteorlogicus is the most gorgeous legendary weapon in the game. But the footsteps are underwhelming and lacking wielding effect is the same because there are none. I would love for them to add a wiedling effect because it really deserves one.
---
You claim you want us to be more of a subreddit that helps newcomers and has discussion, yet what happens when a newcomer posts their first character and it just so happens to not be Sunday? Their post is removed and they leave with a sour taste in their mouth.
---
That'll do, Piggly. That'll do.
---
if two players of equal skill duel (mirage vs engi/ranger) the engi/ranger should win EVERY time. Mirage is not overtuned. If players dont care or know how to play against it thats not my fucking problem.
---
No one wants to post to a dead/dying subreddit. This subreddit should welcome anything and everything related to Guild Wars 2.
---
In addition to this, you'll see some rangers obliterate you on a mesmer which will help you understand how to counter mesmers.
---
&gt; Also, considering it's one of the hardest metas in the game, couldn't the devs spawn additional chests, maybe all over the brand so we actually have an incentive to surf instead of just having a big setpiece in vabbi that no other events or story take place?
---
That'd be nice, but it'd also assume that more than a handful of devs are allowed to touch up existing content. I bet that's actually wrong, outside of - genuine - bugs. I bet the "maintenance"-team is incredibly tiny, maybe not even a handful, and they have to do everything about it.
---
The rest is either working on new mini-maps in cycles, or working on another internal project.
---
Why I think that?
---
* Historically, GW2 has always done design-by-accretion. They don't fix old things, they implement something new and make that "soft-replace" the old one, no matter how sad or broken the old thing is, it'll stay.
---
* The game is 6 years old at this point. I'd be surprised if ANet had no exit plan. At least in early stages, but they're probably already working on GW2. Or Guild Wars: Battlegrounds. Or anything like that.
---
You can't beat an equally skilled mesmer in a 1v1 in this game. Anet still hasn't fixed it and probably never will for some retarded fucking reason.
---
Aside from others have said ("Yes, it's very viable"), just wanted to note one thing:
---
&gt;  but have heard and read Necro is trash tier and basically gets insta-kicked once you get to higher tier content
---
Heal Scourge (the PoF elite spec) is a good support in a good few raid encounters, and condi Scourge / power Reaper are still viable. Sure you'll get your fair share of "METAAAA" slaves, but honestly, don't care too much about those people. Especially when you get into raiding through training guilds/communities, getting knowledge of the bosses and how certain roles during encounters work is more valuable than having the highest dps dick.
---
That said, if you are looking to have a damage alt, in my opinion it's better to get a power spec as your first "endgame alt". Some bosses both in raids and fractals are better dealt with through direct damage aka burst, because of invulnerability phases/stages or adds that need to be killed quickly, and your condition damage can't really ramp up to the point of catching up with other dps players (especially when you're in a group that does have good dps). Warrior can still fill that role too, both base warrior and spellbreaker are viable as a supporting dps (aka banner slave).
---
I was one of the people vocal about the influx of low effort character select screenshots and I am still of the opinion that even when highly upvoted that content remains low effort and of little worth, especially when lacking detail such as transmutes and dyes.
---
I also think the meme situation can be a bit silly at times, especially when they err on the side of potentially offensive to real life circumstances.
---
However, lumping artwork and comics into the Showoff Sunday is a poor decision. This material is often the exact opposite of low effort and can be useful for community cohesion - a highly upvoted post may lead to commissions and retention of that artist's interest in Guild Wars 2.
---
Please reconsider the comic and artwork classification. It shouldn't be bound by the current events rule. 
---
You'll be stuck at the early half of T1. You need agony resistance for higher levels, and only ascended equipment can be infused with agony resistance.
---
Even then, you can grab the cheap ascended accessories. Attune the rings and you'll have enough slots to survive up to early t2.
---
Quote me where I did that. I declared him an indecent human being. Not a racist, his target groups are different. He is one step away from Alex Jones.
---
Now that I think about it, a ban is a bit much, but at the very least a slap on the wrist seems appropriate. And you can't use the n word if you are a public personality. The explanation "It isn't offensive in the UK" is such pure bullshit that I can't believe anyone would say it with a straight face.
---
Hey there, kinda sorry to hijack this to discuss a similar topic but every other attempt got locked and deleted.
---
I'm personally annoyed by the flood of low effort screenshots that get posted and upvoted on this subreddit all the time. Yet I've never even reported one of them because they get that amount of upvotes so it seems like people  want to see them. You said that the phone map completion was definitly low effort, but was left up because of upvotes. I can understand that decision even though I think that post should've been deleted before getting above 50 likes.
---
Now that being sad yesterday another "low-effort" post was posted.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aiaxes/a\_message\_to\_the\_community/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aiaxes/a_message_to_the_community/)
---
I get that this isn't the pinnacle of effort, but getting this picture and then editing it (deleting the torch, adding the board, message and even keeping the fingers to hold it) is far more effort than taking a picture with your phone.
---
I also agree that the message might not be as happy as the "look at my world completion" post, but still there were people who upvoted it. Hell, that was the first "shitpost" that made me laugh in the last month or so. 
---
I would be totally fine if this post would've been downvoted to hell and therefore dissappeared. But instead of giving it the same treatment as the map completion post, leaving it up because it's getting upvotes), it took 4 hours until a mod hopped in, said this is "borderline ban worthy shitposting" and threatened to ban the OP for as long as the community wishes (by upvotes). This kind of behaviour is on the very edge of abusing mod power (in my opinion at least). This first attempt was at least coated as doing this as a community representative fulfilling the punishment the community concluded on (and trying to bash OP into deleting his post). After getting this massive backlash on this kind of ban threat, he just deceided to ban OP (the amount of time here doesn't really matter), remove and lock the post before his self-set deadline.
---
The following threads (including the mature ones) discussing this kind of (in my opinion) unacceptable behaviour got deleted/locked/removed aswell. Going guns out on a post you personally dislike as a moderator is very questionable for me. Locking and removing the thread after seeing that you might have fucked up is even worse. Consistently deleting the mature (I'm not talking about the witchhunt unmod post) threads that try to discuss or understand this kind of behaviour (which I personally never seen on this subreddit before) feels like the final nail in the coffin of free speech.
---
I understand that new topics discussing this might not be very welcome, but if you take the original thread away from people and delete their option to comment and share their views there, that's what is gonna happen. If the lowest effort shitpost ends up being allowed because the community upvoted it, but the other one gets OP banned even though the community upvoted it, how is that proper mod work? 
---
Even now there is this post up,

posted 4 hours after this official announcement. 180 likes, everyone being fine with it. 
---
I get that there might be personal preferences when it comes to these posts, but if you go for the guideline of "if the community upvotes, it can stay" it cannot be accepted to end in a ban for OP if a mod personally dislikes a post.
---
I've asked Godnaz in the comment's already what justified this different kind of reaction but the only answer so far has been the remove &amp; lock.
---
I'm looking forward to you being able to share some insight on this kind of action.
---
Bad players will do to literally anything. So yes skilled players are the best ones to say what is overtuned or not.
---
Rocking that I'd Like to Speak to the Manager 'do
---
One time, my party defeated the boss only because there were three elementalists who could outdamage the healing slowly.
---
Other occassions, not so lucky.
---
As far as I know a boon beast build can destroy a condi mesmer, or at least outlast it on a node. If you're playing pew pew ranger I have no sympathy for you and you should perish.
---
Ill take your word for it then, for me, it seems like the most obvious hyperbole.  I guess you'd have to know his character to see the truth.  
---
New player here, and I feel stumped after hitting level 80. I rarely play for more than 1 active hour a day now, and it's mainly because I don't know what to do now. I've done a few fractals, some bounties and such, but I feel like there's more to it than this. I really want to enjoy this game at max level, but I find it quite hard, because most things I do seem pointless. I'm not big on storylines, but can anyone here suggest something specific to go for? Like armor sets for example? I feel like I need a very specific goal to play
---
Just a tip: in most placed I've been [archive.is](https://archive.is) isn't blocked, and you can just make a backup of any blocked page through it that you can then view.
---
My minionmancer reaper can't ever not be fun for me. Just 4/5 utility slots filled with summons and "Rise!" to get even more little guys. Get all the minion-buffing traits, and Vampiric Aura can heal you in shroud so you're even less than never dying. To overkill it, I use Marauder armor, because running around with combined ~42k HP is fun.
---
I don't think it's because of gambling, or even that they have any sinister motives. But the main profit for Gw2 is gemstore, and the story is their greatest advertisement. I can't fault them for trying to make money, and it's understandable they try to make a middle ground where they use their profits to develop ambitious content without much of a profit for the company such as raids. However, the idea to make story easy still has its consequences that a zone much be easy.
---
"Dramatic"? I mean I'm not a native english speaker, but to me it was surprising but there was little... meaning (again, sorry, different language) in it?
---
Especially because 10s later you get dumped back out into a zone frozen in time, and everyone is standing around doing whatever they do. Back to Istan to farm it is, I suppose. Business as usual.
---
If GW2 still did the whole "permanently change things" this episode could have been **really** cool, granted. Zone out of the final instance and everything about the new zone is changed, permanently, no going back. But meh, they stopped doing that, and between the ultra slow walking, the overdone voice acting, the general chaos of the fight beforehand setting me up with an irritated mood and the fact that 10s later the world forgot what just happened... yeah, whatever. Sorry, not impressed.
---
(I should add that though I think the episode is alright, it was one of the worse ones so far. IMO, of course.)
---
Lel, you're getting downvoted but you aren't wrong though. If it isn't the main plot of an expansion, there's a good chance it won't be resolved.
---
“Serious” guilds. To OP, if you’re looking for a good time raiding with a group of friends don’t join guilds like this poster, “no time to waste” is not what you should play a video game for. That’s my 2 cents for the day 😁👍
---
First off: with the right group you are good to go with any class, not everyone sticks 100% to the meta and raids are very doable without fully optimised groupcomposition/gear/whatsoever.
---
So alting in GW2.. I got 18 chars atm and they can be quite useful for storing, other builds, faster farming (e.g. LS3 winterberries, wood at WP pagga, contracts in the kings grave)...
---
From these I declare 3 as "mains" (ranger/druid, necro/scourge, guardian/dh/Firebrand although dh + Firebrand are split on 2 chars and "the" scourge is also split on 2 for condition and support builds) and I play the rest from time to time if needed or I simply got bored playing my mains.
---
Espacially if you got Ascended gear (which will come to you faster through raids) it's very easy to switch, since it remains account bound and can be given to any character.
---
Even achievement /story wise there is no real downside of alting. The achievements are account wide and story parts you don't want to do again can be skipped right up to the next LS episode if you want to. 
---
In that case, soft-confirm all three of them? Mess with the playerbase :D
---
😂 holy shit, thats hilarious
---
please tell me it was a blind date

---
Is what I currently run in the open world. Unfortunately I can only get up to 90% crit chance, but it' got get decent sustain, stab generation, okay protection up time, range utility, CC, and pretty much permanent might fury and swiftness. Build  only have 15K health so use your cooldowns wisely.

---
I suck at PvP so when I play I used this. The basic combo is too just FT toolbelt and pistol 2 and hope that's enough.  
---
To be fair with Caithe it **did** feel weird because it was so pointless. It felt as if they had the art assets lying around for a different reason and wanted to use them before Caithe gets removed (since that was the original plan).
---
It's not a bad thing though, just felt a bit weird. That Caithe shows up in a major capacity was cool, the physical transformation felt out of place. But then so did the whole trial tbh. Quite "filler" content.
---
Overfailing a raid is fun from your Point of view? Deadeye can spread boons, but no one dares to use it as a support.
---
You can so fractals or something else if you want to play with composition. Raids are the end content of pve, so you need to be prepared in order to 1. Contribute to success and 2. Not waste other player's time 
---
Personally, I don't think they will. The theory I think is correct is that Glint never intended her champions to kill Kralk at all; that everything Glint set up was just for us to destroy his eye and in doing so take away his ability to see the future. And then once he can no longer see the future, the rest of us will actually stand a chance against him now that he can't see exactly what we're going to do.
---
Some classes just rock, paper, scissors other classes, and mesmer happens to beat a lot of things 1v1. Balanced tho. (i'll take my downvotes, mesmer mains)
---
Aye, but it's honestly not the worst thing in the world. But the breakbar phase encourages you to split up, but also punishes you when you split up because you have less CC. 
---
IF you have feedback to his video or his opinion, why dont you leave that feedback in the thread where his video got linked or his video on youtube directly?
---
A link to that video would have been nice as well.
---
I agree with you, but because of the timegate to convert to funerary incense, I disagree with you. Sorry :/ 
---
Also some events give good amount of money as well. Spirit run with call of the mists gives 1 g after finishing 
---
My guess why dungeons are dead is because everyone who coded them left the company.
---
axe/axe and GS yes, dagger/dagger big no, unfortunate as it is.
---
but this is partly true, there are guilds that do raid kills in all blue/white gear, low man and non-meta. training guilds will teach you mechanics no matter what dps class you are. people who like to experiment will accept new things. recent class changes open some space for improvisation as well.
---
Oh i know she wants to but why would anet want to work with someone who openly attacked their fanbase (Gamers) in the past? 
---
They fired 2 of their employees last year for doing the same.

can someone add a white flag instead of the sword? piken seems to be great at running from us unless they outnumber you 3 to 1
---
Pugs don't know what build you're running and they have no way of finding out since there's no gear checker in gw2. And as long as your dps isn't abysmal they don't care about you.
---
Some people like to think a lot about themselves and what others think of them. The truth is that, in order to be sucessful, you need to stop overthinking it it and try new things. You might find out that it wasn't as badnas you though. Also, most people out there don't give a shit about you, really, it's just your own perception of reality that is holding you back.
---
does comment section count ?
---
In 10 years GW3 will be out or god forbid some mobile "sequel". Other than that, I doubt GW2's engine has the capabilities to update its graphics like WoW's does.

Holy kitty! THAT, that's the stuff nightmares are made of.

^(Completely forgot how that meme terrified me. Thanks for the reminder.)

Do you enjoy high level PvE content? Gearing and learning raids or advancing fractal levels are both good options. Could even just focus on getting your [build](https://snowcrows.com/) and [gear](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character) set up. You could set a goal of getting a legendary collection done. Working on WvW unlocks or advancing PvP rank (new season just starting). Really just depends on what you like to do.
---
I'll use my Reddit name if that's cool.
---
The beetle mount that comes from s4 episode 3 is close to must have, considering Anet is adding beetle races to seasonal events.
---
Episode 2 has the position rewinder and a free 32 slot bag which are both very nice, but not "must have" 
---
Episode 4 gives you a Bond of Vigor mastery which is absolutely must have both for beetle and other mounts, it substantially increases your mobility on most mounts.
---
As for gemstore stuff there is nothing must have, but there were lots of really cosmetic skins released since then (must have for fashion wars)

Make sure the game is aimed at mature people? That is my guess. Other sub that I found also be mainly positive is for eso. What do they have in common? Avarage player ages is well over 20 for both
---
Use my reddit name
---
You mean there is no PK things?
---
There is, but only in it's own gamemode, away from open world.
---
it's hard to dick over other players and you get rewarded for cooperating. pvp is where most of the salt is but it's small compared to pve community.
---
so the community is nicer because of that.
---
also alot of player know that the game is bad at explaining itself to new players so they're alot more forgiving of newb questions.
---
just my theory anyway

If in about 5 years from now they start making a new engine for a different game, it might be ready in 10 years. GW2 graphics are not going anywhere imo, esp. that they fit the current state of the game just fine.
---
&gt; It becomes far more worthwhile to invest the resources into making something when 50+ percent of your population touches it instead of 1.
---
You seem to have no idea how any of this shit works. You need endgame content and good players in every game. Casuals need something to look up to, some "this could be me if I would spend more time".

Ah i see, no wonder no full of salts in this game?
---
When you feel like in the mood for some open world PvP, you can go to WvW. Otherwise, if you just want to do some exp (or whatever) in PvE, no player can kill you. A high level character going in low-lvl areas to one shot newbies, is a shitty game design that thankfully GW2 doesn't have.
---
Heyo, I'll enter with my reddit name then :) Do you want the account name right now or can I just send it to you if I win?

i don't really know (not a pvp player) all i know is that in spvp matchmaking is(was?) buggered (because of low player numbers from what i've heard)
---
and wvw is kinda hard to get into. 
---
Raids are the most fucking casual "endgame" I've ever seen in my 30 years of gaming. The problem is that the average player of this game is dumb as fucking shit and can't be assed to read up on what to do with their class for 5 fucking minutes and doesn't want to learn, but would rather blame peolpe who invested some brain cells.

In Guild Wars 2? Yikes, did you also find the lost city of Atlantis?
---
In the One guild there is a introduction channel on their discord. Will find the odd 18 or 19 year old, but the others are normally 24-40. (no way to compare eso with gw2 btw. They are too different... Like comparing a taco with pasta)

---
the expansions unlock things after level 80 and give you 2 lvl 80 boosts if you buy 2 expacs. i mean you can get a mount until you play the first PoF story, in which you have to be a lvl 80. 
---
yes, technically the expacs add end game content to some degrees like raids are locked behind expacs. but fractals you can still play to about tier 3 iirc. you don't have any mastery to train your fractals to unlock more stuff that boost your trinkets. but it's still better than nothing.

i think for now, play, enjoy it the way you want to. grab the concept of the game or whatever make you want to play. if you really like it, definitely would recommend buying both expacs. they change the way you play the game and open more doors to exploration.  
---
i played as a f2p for the longest before i decided to buy the game. mostly cuz the country i was living at the time had trouble with cards using for online stuff. so i couldn't get it done until i moved to another country across the globe. lol. 
---
The mouthbreathing casuals of this game are too dumb to even find the aerodrome, so no.
---
Isn't that the whole point of farming? To get gold in the fastest and most efficient way possible? What are reasons are there? Certainly can't be for fun, because a farming spot gets tedious after farming it for the third time in a row. Switching between them will not change that either. I don't even know which other farming spots you're talking about, because there are like three in the entire game that still exist.
---
Will give it a shot , is glacial heart really necessary ? cause half of the skill isnt use cause you dont have hammer
---
Great innitiative! This community really is something. Having said that count me in using reddit name
---
Yes, very. You can have all classes. Reaching cap level doesn't take that long in gw2, but if you don't want to do it for everyone, you can use tomes. Although, I recommend exping (is that a word?) them normally, to learn the classes little by little.
---
A lot of players really enjoy the game. 
---
I personally take about an hour everyday at a starting area map get my mentor tag on and ask if anyone have questions or need help.
---
And I’m sure I’m not the only one as I got help from a mentor when I first joined so it’s my way of paying it forward ^^
---
Plus the game has great events that require other players help and team work is great in this game ^^ everyone is rewarded ^^
---
I would never relate those 2 beautiful creatures to this, class. :)
---
If the people that win entered with their reddit name il message them on reddit for the GW2
---
Tbh, the UI is one of the major things that made me want to play this game. Odd I know, but I'm a graphic designer and I just couldn't stand the mess of UI and buttons in other games. The reason I started playing GW2 (since launch) was the UI, nice presentation and concept artworks haha! 
---
You'll get used to the UI in time :)
---
If you have the free bank space at the moment, it can't hurt to store them for now. At worst you can always chuck them later if you decide you need the space.
---
Been saying literally ever since they released the gift of desert mastery. It's honestly something that in the grand scheme of things seem so little, right, but screams incompetent oversight to me. I'd expect this to be thoughout from the start and if not then at the very least fixed in a timely manner... Oh well.

I'd do the PoF metas if they had amalgamated gemstones.

So it seems these elitists have their pride so far up their asses that it poked out from their eyes, making them unable to see the truth. 
---
Yeah i feel that how good and nice the event, the drops always useful even though im in higher level in lower level map. First time i had this drops that never i countered before from my past games.
---
so... i guess the build is trash then? 13 minues talking how busted it is and then a footage of solid ocean.. lel
---
No, the game don't need more inflation. we need more unbound items so gold is destroy by tax
---
which is an accomplishment, that is fucking hard to pull off.
---
Spirit run is 1g50s now without call of the mists, 3g with it. Since the change that added li to it.
---
Overall gold per wing (before call of the mists) is:
---
W1: 6g from bosses, 2g from events
---
W2: 6g from bosses, 50s for events
---
W3: 6g from bosses, 1g50s for TC
---
W4: 8g from bosses
---
W5: 8g from bosses
---
W6: 6g from bosses, 1g from events (currently always has this doubled) 
---
1. Transferring would improve your ping but it would not have any effect on fps.
---
2. If you chose any world with a language tag, you will see that language more often in PvE, and always in WvW. For PvE in general people speak English but you will see other languages too. For groups pay attention to the language indicators, no indicator means English (for most groups at least)
---
Aww, thank you for welcoming back me :)
---
Yeah you're right, sometimes im encountered other player just passing by but im ok with that since there might be language barrier since not all player speak english or just minding their own business for quests. But whenever i ask by PM, they still willing to answer even just ask about costume they were use. This make feel good and soft because I came from the game that so harsh and full toxic, salts of ultra-killer rare gears, etc.
---
I hope i can stay and loyal in this game because some of good games require subs and i cant afford that rest of my life :(

I'll sign up with my Reddit name as well, cheers for the giveaway! 
---
but it requires subs :(
---
It would be bad writing if Aurene wasn't coming back. If she remains dead, her story had no purpose and they wasted all that build up for nothing. Season 2 was about the egg (Mordremoth crashed the Zephyrite ship to steal it from the Master of Peace), HoT was partly about the egg (getting it to Tarir), Season 3 was about bonding with Aurene, PoF was about bonding with Aurene, Season 4 was about bonding with Aurene - they've gone all in on this for multiple steps of the story and so far it has accomplished very little (she ate a lich and helped take down a god that had nothing to do with her original purpose). 
---
Aurene's death being permanent would also mean Vlast's story was stupid pointless - it's supposed to tell an alternate path for Aurene where a Scion of Glint develops on their own and doesn't succeed - it's why even in Glint's Lair there was more repetition of Aurene being told to work together with the commander to succeed. The writers are trying as hard as they can to make the story about an NPC dragon while at the same time trying to make our protagonist equally as important - the close bond with Aurene, the entitlement to the egg we had over Caithe etc. Honestly, I don't see any way for the Aurene story to end without us riding on her back in a fight against an Elder Dragon. It simply doesn't make sense that we haven't done it yet unless they are saving it for the final fight. PoF was all about mounts, and a story instance where we get to fly with our mount sized dragon to fight as one with them against an Elder Dragon is too obvious not to do. They are saving it for the true final fight (it's why they had us glide on those convenient ley lines in the Kralkatorrik fight instead of involving Aurene as our mount - they are saving that for later).
---
Also, it help people getting a foot into raids, so they can learn how to beat bosses smoothly. Help recruiting players afterward when they're more confident.
---
I wanna say that your concepts are really really well designed.
---
yep, especially ppl from my country, thats why i ran away to this game
---
Hey! I'd like to sign up with my Reddit account! Thanks a lot for the giveaway! Great! 
---

---
Concerning your gem purchases, yes those are def the best QoL to get. Get Copper fed, Silver fed you will very rarely get to use because of mystic salvage kits
---
Does this count as a low effort post?
---
Returning player kind of confused with some ongoing discussion on crafting.
---
I've read stuff here and there and lots of conflicting info on how useful crafting is in early endgame, some saying that it's good for your first set of ascended gear, others saying it's useless, just do fractals.
---
So, my question now is: Should I level crafting for my first proper endgame character? I intend on running Fractals but I've heard *having* ascended gear for endgame fractals is recommended. I do enjoy crafting a lot so that's a thing.
---
Also does crafting help me with making Legendaries at all, or does that happen outside of crafting and can be done with the Mystic Forge entirely?
---
Thanks for the answers!
---
is that bot program things?
---
You know... There is a difference between "well over 20" and "20 something"? One includes students which often includes immature people. The other excludes them, and includes those over 30 as well "
---
I’m in! Using my reddit name
---
I mean they don't have to use a new way. Why is Aurene the only option for absorbing a dragon's power? Other dragons exist, including good ones (like Kunnavang in the Jade Sea). We've seen with Mordremoth, dragon is just a word and not a specific creature, so why does it have to be a "dragon"? Why can't Dwayna, or the Pale Tree (conveniently also a dragon champion like Glint and much older than Aurene is) absorb a dead dragon's magic?
---
I mean of course it will be Aurene, they spent several seasons and two expansions setting it up in a not subtle way and that story and build up is wasted with Aurene's death, so of course it's temporary, but even if it wasn't, why can't other powerful beings replace Aurene/Glint?
---
You can never have too many alts!!
---
It may be in group content, but it's great in solo play. A good balance of ranged and melee play, lots of vulnerability on many targets (which weaver can't do), aoe cc and burn retreat for kiting and grouping mobs (which is tricky on staff weaver as a beginner). More targets mean more damage and staff tempest is the ele's best aoe build. Sure you can burst a few mobs on a sword weaver faster, but you could do the same with s/w tempest, which might be even better, but staff is more fool proof.
---
Those mobs in the instance hurt a lot and spawn in huge numbers. Stalling and outhealing is not really an option, especially on a build with minimal aoe capabilities. Not to mention that weaver is not very beginner friendly, while tempest can be played on lazy mode.
---
Bad benchmarks for group content doesn't make builds bad in solo play. Reaper is a perfect example of this.
---
Having the expansions enables you to go to LA immediately which will be a roadblock at level 30 for personal story missions (otherwise you have to wait until level 35 iirc) it also opens up the trading point which was something that really bugged me when I was core only
---
Dungeons are still useful despite being pretty inactive these days, because it's the most cost-efficient way for new players to get zerker weapons and armor. Hell, you gain in gold this way, instead of losing it. Removing this would make it harder for them to gear up. Sure, there's the caveat of fractals 1-20 not requiring AR, but how would you balance it reward-wise going up? 20 tokens per run with half the number of fractal encryptions? I dunno, it *feels* like a nerf reward-wise. I'd rather do them separately and get *full* rewards that way.
---
Using Reddit name.
---
Crafting is pretty much mandatory for getting into T4 fractals, as only ascended (and legendary) gear have AR slots but exotics don't. You'll really need to get enough gear with AR slots beforehand to be able to play them, because random drops are much much lower in lower tiers. Once you get 1 character geared and you can do T4s on a regular basis and have the patience for it, you can do T4 dailies and use the random ascended drops to gear alts.
---
For legendaries you'll probably need to max your crafting profession eventually as well. Though the final step is always in the Mystic Forge, the items that you put there will require crafting (precursor, certain gifts).

Someone has a super inflated ego
---
greatest guild in the game.......my ass, the greatest guild in the game is all the guild you like to play in.
---
Necros, specifically scourges are very powerful and useful in raids and high lvl fractals actually. 
---
The raid scene has a few meta "staple" classes that are used and very useful in all raids such as chronomancers, druids, berserkers, scourge. Other classes are used for dps roles and some are more "optimal" than others on specific boss encounters.
---
Fractals have a similar meta going on for them but only really in high lvl fractals or Challenge mode fractals. Otherwise it can be cleared just with any profession really.
---
Open world pve and story modes can be played with anything you wish and with any kind of build imaginable. Tho you will still be  much better off by focusing on burst dmg since it helps to kill things faster and at the same time move trough the map faster.
---
As for having alts, yes the game is very alt friendly as it doesnt take much time or gold to get lvl 80 exotics, and all ascendant gear ,while expensive , are account bound so you can switch them around different characters.
---
Ascendant weapon/armor can also have their stats changed for a small price via mystic forge, and you can find a few sets of accessories that can also change their stats as well 
---
Why why why why why! This is ridiculous honestly. As an artist who sometimes does Gw2 art if I do some art I’m not going to specifically wait until the next Sunday to post some art that might get drowned out by everyone else who is posting their art and other things on the same day. This really seems like an overreaction. Looking at the current posts on the subreddit there is so much variety. You don’t get more discussion suddenly by banning art, you just get less art and the same amount of discussion. 
---

The spark for me this time was boredom i guess :D

This game is ultra casual and doesn't demand users progression. Even if one is just level 80 one can progress however they want also all classes can do everything so one doesn't need to depend on any one.
---
Majority of players are 25 plus at least in my experience so they don't rage around like mad people.
---
I'd like to sign up with my reddit name.  
---
Thanks for organising this! :)
---
There are few reasons imo:
---
* The game is buy to play and values your time, so theres no sub or pressure on anyone for anything
---
* There is no gear grind that makes people competitive, or lvl cap increases
---
* The game has a ton of quality of life features which other games often dont have (or charge you money to get them)
---
* The game is designed for people to help out eachother and not fight over things (such as shared mob loot, shared gathering nodes, chests and treasures, mesmers portaling jumping puzzles etc.
---
* The game is mostly oriented towards casual pve exploration and story mode, which can be done in groups or solo, and people can play whatever they like without any forced meta, or obstacles.
---
All that being said, the pvp community can be toxic, specifically in ranked pvp leagues where a bad player or a troll can effect other peoples matches, win rate or just time.

I love you because you are the best example of what not to be absolutely everywhere. You demand people always agree with you and anyone who doesn't is always wrong. Because you're always right, of course. That's your idiotic attitude to life. Casuals are the bogeyman to blame. Fell off your bike? God damn casuals did it. (And good job sustaining a MMO without casual players LUL, since 
---
 you seem to think WvW/PvP players aren't casual... newsflash idiot: most players in any game mode are casuals. In any game.) 
---
* getting exotic gear is very easy, and not very expensive ( considering lvling is quite fast, i would suggest keeping your gold for lvl 80 exotics). Ascendant gear is only really needed for high lvl fractals and dont offer a lot more benefits (stat wise) compared to exotics. Ascendant gear can also be very very costly, but you could get some ascendant trinkets from playing fractals.
---
* Gryphon mount is costly and should be considered an "end game" goal
---
* Deadeye spec requires a lvl 80 characters and 250 ? hero points. Core tyria hero challenges reward 1 point, but PoF ones reward you with 10 each.
---
* Im a old veteran with over 600 transmogs that just piled up over the years, but as a new player i suggest striping naked, go to your bank wardrobe, and preview all armor pieces in the game and write down the ones you like most. You dont have to wear a full set, try mix and matching. After you find your self "the perfect armor set" hunt those skins down, get a lvl 80 exotic set you will use the most (for thief berserker is good) and use your 6 strans charges on that armor set.  
---
To get more charges you can either play pvp, or simply create a new character and explore all 6 cities. It would take between 1.5 -2 hours maybe without a mount.
---
How long will all this take you? I dont think anyone can say.. if you have a fast and grindy mind set, and completely ignore everything else that isnt on the list i would say something around:
---
* getting to lvl 80 and having the money to buy a lvl 80 exotic would take you maybe 3-4 days
---
* unlocking deadeye fully can take you 1 afternoon
---
* getting a badass looking armor set/weapon all depends on which skins you really really like. If youre not using any non tradable skins from dungeons, fractals,ascendant weapons, raid pieces or living world pieces ,and only using pieces that you can buy from the Tp then id say maybe 1-2 days.
---
* Getting the griffon mount will take you maybe 1-3 days of achievements, but getting 250 gold will take you much more.
---
* Farming silverwaste bags nets you around 20 gold per hour, soo it could take you around 13-15 hours of silverwaste farming. But this kind of farm also requires you to have  a 2nd character which is lvl 50ish....so youll have to spend some more time lvling the alt as well.
---
Nobody can say if those goals are good or not for you since nobody really knows whats fun for you and what your overall goal is. People can tell you to take it easy, lvling is fun, gearing up in exotic lvl 80 is easy, ascendant gear isnt necessary unless you are min/maxing stats and playing high lvl fractals (or raids i guess), to go explore, have fun, play the story missions, try out pvp, wvw, activities, adventures, low lvl fractals, hunt achievements, do core tyria masteries for auto loot /precursor crafting...etc etc etc. Theres really a lot of things to do in the game, and for a new player theres a lot of ground to cover, 2 expansions and season 3/4 zones to unlock is a lot

okay I dont know how many people like the ending of the episode but, because they referenced the Infinity War in the interview I want to say that the ending is the same as in infinity war. by that I mean tha we all know that the build up of over two expansions and three seasons not just ends here. I have the feeling that in both universes the dead are not just dead. I really liked some turns and many interactions between the characters but the product which we get is dissappointing. 
---
This is from the same guy that made a 30 minute video about a comment someone made he didn't like
---
I leveled from lvl 41 all the way to 80 during the attack and the retaking... got several divinity runes that sold for like 10 gold
---
That is also when I found out about the TP
---
And also when i found out how fun mesmer greatsword is
---
Fractals have a good system set up where you can run in exotics in T1 and as you work your way up, and start getting more experienced, you get to more difficult tiers.  T1 fractals are easier than the core dungeons, and you can take as much time as you need until you feel like you can move on.  However, if you have ascended gear already and just buy infusions with gold while starting t4s you will not have a good time.
---
To many gw themed things? As in 90 percent effortless screenshots
---
&gt; Raids have such little content because the raid scene has lost their fucking minds and have affirmed they will murder everyone at arena net if they dare release an easy mode and Anet has stuck to that.
---
&gt; 
---
How does it feel, being this mentally challenged and hateful?
---
And Caithe in going to be the new Elder dragon to replace Kralk...
---
&gt; GW2 supposedly has a Renaissance/early gunpowder age-based high fantasy setting.
---
That heavily depends on culture. While all races have members who use pistol/rifle/turrets/lightsaber, outside of these classes:
---
* Humans seem pretty medieval for me, trebuchets being their most advanced weapon I can think of. Though they have proper streetlamps in Divinity's Reach, which according to wiki would put them at 16th century.
---
* Norn is probably more Viking-era, they only seem to use hammers/axes/sword/etc. Plus they only use torches for lighting.
---
* Sylvari has lot of plant-based technology, turrets, lamps and such, but nothing electrical or even highly refined metal. They can't really be placed in human history.
---
* Charr has competent steel-working and machine-building skills, so I'd put them around 19-20th century. They have cannons and giant motorbikes :D
---
* And asura is the obvious one, completely digital/magical sci-fi tech.
---
yazure.3941 
---
Thanks :D
---
and I still hate it that kralk, in a world where there are so many potential cool antagonists, still lives and takes up so much of the story for so damn long. He already was a big boy in the books, then in S3 (I believe), in PoF AND in Season 4. Cant we just end this? I feel like arena net struggles with their timeline and just puts this up to work on Cantha or something. And then we are STILL at a point where we just revisit places of Guild Wars 1. so much wasted potential
---
I am currently at a 16 personal fractal level, so T4 is a long way away, but I have a few ascended rings infused, I think I have somewhere around 25 AR at the moment
---
I agree with many people sentiment that making it into daily garbage was a bad idea but Istan did need a nerf and even with this nerf it is still more gold per hour than silverwastes due to the phylacteries. I guarantee Istan is still going to be 30+ gold p/hr.
---
those aren't the only ways either. Glint is still around too don't forget. It doesn't matter that they die. They can just keep going in the mists anyway. 
---
Good to see beans is still acting nowadays 
---
Reddit name too, why don't you use your gold on your own unlockables instead? 
---
In general your main dps skill is blurred fenzy, try to klick it on cooldown. Starting with a weapon phantasm can be a good point if you have some distance.
---
If you ask me play with the dmg mantra and the disenchanter + defender phantasm. Try to cast all phantasm at once and refresh them with aether signet. Throw a blurred fenzy in btw and cast phantasm again. (as a general rotation) 
---
As you're playing chrono also try to bring enough clones up before you cast all phantasm and cast them in your continuum split. (first just try out for yourself how much clones you need to do it)
---
-&gt; phantasm are rdy after CS, recast them, aether signet, recast them
---
Shatter mind wrack when you got 3 clones up.
---
Sword 3 only, if blurred fenzy and phantasm is on CD.
---
I don't know which content you're playing, but if you play open world or dungeons it's not wrong to take time warp as your elite skill and use the danger time trait. 
---
If you play fractals and raids you should definitely use some YouTube channels or sites, which provide you with the latest builds and rotations. 
---
But it always depends on the situation, This is just an idea to get into it.
---
You can get some more info about your rotation on the snow crows page, or just search on YouTube for a dps chrono rotation as I said. 
---
Every healing that you do to allies.
---
Doing daily fractals for your highest tier can be pretty fast and a good way to get items/gold. [DT](https://discretize.eu/) has high end info and builds, just use it as an idea for now don't try to replicate them as you are still learning. Just advancing your fractal level while doing the dailies and learning your class could be enough of a goal for you for now till you get further if you want. Otherwise getting into raids isn't as hard as people make it seem. You can check out a [plethora of info](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g7zlH3pVPvW21WIh5-qL-IXDeABtJzIqnZYXP8tCcM0/edit) and use the ever helpful [training discords](https://snowcrows.com/raids/training/).

Make sure your rings are attuned and infused, so they have 3 slots each.  Save up your infusions until you can make +9s.  That is what you will use eventually and will get you up to level 50 or so.
---
If it heals it will get increased by Force of Will, will also work on any regeneration you apply. Basically the healing numbers is calculated like so:
---
 [ Base healing + (Scaling * Healing Power) ] * Modifiers
---
Modifers = traits (Force of Will for example) + Gear (Monk Rune, Sigil of Transference) + Food (Rice Balls)

I ended up going with Invoker armour for my [necromancer](https://imgur.com/a/KAQI88y) (with Archon helm and Exalted gloves). But it *was* a struggle to find even one good looking combo.

Didn't you know GW2 is strictly living world content now

That's only if you want to craft the precursor for the Gen 1 legendaries and the first 4 of the new set (hope, nevermore, astralaria, Chuka). All the ones after that you just buy the recipe sheets from Hobbs.

I'm having a hard time thinking of what to say, but I wanted to comment.  Reading this was like reading a letter from the principal to the entire student body and their parents and then getting to that one paragraph that feels like you're specifically being called out.  I do not know if it was intentional, but the shade is real, and I applaud it.  I'm not hurt or upset about it; I really got a kick out of it whether it was directed at me or not. c:
---
I guess I'll start my premature apology tour now.  I'm sorry if my dropping 3 comics, 2 of them about Heart of Thorns, in one week basically ruined everything for all the artists in this sub.  I am sorry that my actions contributed to this blatant attack on my peers and members of our community.  I admit I came rolling in HoT, but I never intended to spam this sub with my dated comics; I was just feeling inspired, but fear not this night for the reaction by those in power has choked any inspiration right out of me.

As someone who has an engineer only for Istan, the big deal with engineers is the flamethrower not the turrets.

In pvp and wvw revenant plays offensive role so if your focus is to support go for guardian - firebrand elite spec

Tweaking numbers seems a lot of ork for this, when in essence you are simply talking about a weekly or monthly "event" thing.
---
Just add a buff like they did with WvW recently and give players better rewards for say HoT Metas for a month. Then PoF Metas for a month. Then LS season 3 for a month. And so on.
---
Thanks for the giveaway! In game:  Tecnomage.2519. Greatsword or Shield would be great!
---
Good Luck for me!
---
Well, GW2 is not a charity, if they are focusing on "casual players" ans story, it's probable because that's the most profitable.
---
While we can play the armchair game designers &amp; marketing experts as much as we want, you can be sure that they evaluated investing more ressources in all things suggested in this comment section.

Her death specifically? I don't know, I wish I was prepared :'''( . But honestly, you can probably answer that yourself, how Glint prepared us for these events to happen. Aurene knows her part, we know our part. We had to work together to make it happen.

Right. But that's 3 months+ out. This didn't need to be addressed now. Especially in an already dwindling community.

You have brain damage but it fine :)

None of these game modes are "alive" because of an easy mode. The present gear treadmill just gives everyone incentive to at least try to get into it while many GW2 players could not care less about legendary crafting for various reasons. There might be an initial effort required to get into raids but easy modes would not make as much difference in raid population as you claim it would.
---
I miss the old dungeon times, I used to spend nights watching Targ his stream(wonder how he's doing anyway) 
---
Well technically she would be a dragon champion unlike the other dragons in this franchise, no? She may have the capabilities Shiny or kunnavang or whoever to take on the mantle of an Elder Dragon.

You run neither in current meta.

I don't like seeing jokes about this on the sub for my favourite game. 
---
im in with my reddit name :3
---
It says in the next build, do we have an idea of when that might be?
---
Your best one so far. It matches beetle model boundaries pretty well too.
---
Neither are stronger for WvW - they each fill an important role.
---
5 man party makeup in a zerg would be guardian (firebrand), revenant (herald), 2x necromancer (scourge) and X.
---
X will be either warrior (spellbreaker), mesmer (chronomancer) or elementalist (weaver/tempest).
---
ALL of these bring some level of support, guardian and mesmer the most.
---
For armours the revenant can be played full berserker with a few marauder trinkets - this is high risk, high reward in zerg as you're not as frontline as the warrior but you're bot backline either - you're midline really.
---
Guardian is more time consuming to gear for as you need full minstrels, which is expensive to craft. You can run the Triumphant Hero reward trak to get an exotic piece that can be stat selected to minstrel which would be the cheapest route.
---
Warrior in zergs are generally full marauder with dps runes OR use zerker trinkets and weapons with durability runes and a shield. Hammer is mandatory for both. While you find warrior boring in PVE, I find warrior the more fun of these 3 in WvWvW.
---
Thanks. I have two newbie friends playing with and they want to have some practice runs to be confident before running with pug groups.

OP doing great stuff for the community 😊
---
It's odd but by your logic raids should be a ghost town, given once a week rewards. But my friend circle continues to want to do them repeatedly throughout the week. Must be something with fractals that people find less enjoyable. Or possibly the AR requirement hinders what people can play, so they don't enjoy it as much?
---
Been playing more through PoF lately and felt compelled to paint this up. Time to catch up on episodes ~
---
Don't forget about all the "I just started playing and this community is honestly AMAZING!" 
---
I’ll use my Reddit name also, so include me like the rest 👍. Btw very nice of you what ur doing specially for new players I guess? It would be an add on right? Dunno much yet haha ! 
---
Yes. Chill application is additional condi cover. It also counts as an additional hit for your justice. Your Axe 2 is an AoE daze, so with 5 targets it will proc 5 times for a total of 10 hits initially, which is 3 burn AoE, chill, and bleed right off the bat.
---
Just because you're referencing Living Story, doesn't mean that FFXIV questions are relevant here.
---
But most games have maintenance on their servers constantly, something we live without here.
---
Might be better to ask that on their reddit instead of here?  :)
---
My Reddit name is fine. Add me in
---
This and your other work is genuinely fantastic. Have you sent it to ANet?
---
Back when Anet was providing some random statistics on game play, this was the one stat that I really wanted to see. How many precursors have dropped in WvW and not been picked up? (or anywhere really)
---

Depends on the quality of shirt.
---
I paid £25 for a *Steins;Gate* shirt from the Rice Digital stand at MCM Comicon 2017; it's been through countless washes and still looks great over a year later.
---
Then again I've bought shirts that after 2 washes are a complete mess.
---
They have regular maintenance days, where all game server are shut down for several hours (=unable to login and play). It's like the weekly maintenance in WoW, but a bit longer.
---
GW2 doesn't have this.

More importantly there's also ~never a downside to other players around.
---
In most older MMORPGs enemies would be "tagged" by someone, and only that player gets loot. As a result, you frequently **didn't** want the other people around you. Taking your quest credit. Taking your stuff!
---
In GW2 it's always nice to be near other players. Better loot for everyone with more champs spawning and all.
---
style is also a form of art. and then were are back at ops request....
---
Thanks, I'll get to it then!
---
Use my Reddit name, please! 😀
---
Because the locked the WvW crowd in a dungeon
---
Not sure what the damage would be with plague doctor instead but you're picking a 24%-4% increase in outgoing heal instead of better boon  output and a ~200hp heal in all (larger) symbols. I think I'd rather have seraph if you really wanted to go condi healing. In a fight where you weren't stacking then you could make a good case for Force but otherwise I just don't think it's worth it. 
---
Its not like pugs only want the most optimal group comp. They just dont want necros because of their lack of single target DPS. Private guild groups are something else entirely.

I think they meant they want you to go and play HoT metas or do some Fractals instead of looping Istan for hours. I gotta be honest, it feels good farming Istan because you make a lot of money, but I could be having more fun if I just did other things after a cycle or two.
---
MrMonkey.4652
---
I play both GW2 and FFXIV, and while I do prefer FFXIV's gameplay and raids, I think playing GW2 is way more relaxing because most of the problems you can have in a MMO come from your interactions with other players. 
---
One of the main reason I like playing GW2 is that it has this fairly unique system where, in many activities, even in end game, you don't really play with other people but more next to people, in some sort of spontaneous cooperation. That really limits the amount of drama, salt and grudges that you find while playing.
---
To make a comparison, in FFXIV, in end game, the main options I have are dungeons, trials and raids where I'm forced to play with 3 to 23 potentical idiots, sometimes it's awesome, but sometimes, when you're stuck 40mins with the famous "ice mage", or you have to heal a tank that doesn't know defencive cooldown, it's just infuriating.
---
In GW2, I always have way more options, like world bosses, meta events or achievements, that don't involve others. If something happens I'm the only one responsible for it and I'm producing way less salt

Soinetwa.5193 ^-^
---
but Why are you bored ingame?
---
You don't really because if those 1% left raids no one would give a fuck. The things to look up to in this game have 0% to do with actually doing content and are primarily just people with a lot of money.
---
If WoW of all things flat out said, yeah our options were stop making raids or make raids more accessible then you can damn well bet a game with 1/20th the population will suffer the same problem.
---
As much as they don't like to believe it the hardcore are the laughably small minority and games would go on just as well without them. They may be the most "dedicated" but they are the least relevant group to actually keeping a game alive.

I've already filed a complaint with the same logic. I've struggled to find people ingame to play with until I found Istan. 
---
Well, depending on your playstyle it will now be much more profitable actually.
---
For me that is the case - I missed a few LW episodes and didn't get much time to fully play PoF to the extent I would like to. This means that I will usually farm for an hour or two on the weekends, before picking a few achievements or other things I missed from previous content to finish. Only after I get bored doing that or actually complete it will I get back to any kind of farming. There is a lot of people like me... actually it would be the overwhelming majority of players that doesn't farm the same content for hours and hours in a single play session.
---
Use my Reddit name too please :)

Do the rotation at the golem and check arcdps. It's less dps than the auto chain. I see nearly every mesmer doing his most dps with blurred fenzy. 
---
During halloween I leveled my old SW bagger into a holosmith; they wound up as a dedicated Istan scrapper - flamethrower is awesome when you trait for it (especially the stability from [Juggernaut](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Juggernaut)).  That doesn't do much for crap reaction time (if you're even middle of the pack on a round of champ tagging it's a tossup how many you'll get, and it won't be 100%), but it's still substantially better than other classes under similar conditions.
---
You don't even need to bother with the achievement panel anymore. Just choosing the skin in the wardrobe panel won't consume any transmutation charges whether you have the item or not.
---
Not much of a gameplay question, just curious. Has there been any know errors currently when buying Gems?
---
I had just tried to buy 800 for $10 USD within the last 20 minutes or so, and everything went through as normal until it got to the final confirm page. After making sure the agreement box was checked and clicking submit, it had a significantly longer loading time than usual, then it jumped back to the initial page to select an amount of Gems without giving me the success message. I've never experienced something like this before, so I waited like 5-10 minutes to see if the Gems were taking longer to be added to my account and if I would get the email. Neither showed up, so I checked on my bank transaction history and nothing apparently went through at all. I figured I'd try another 800 in pursuit of science to see if it was just a rare bug or lag or something, and the same exact thing happened again. No email or history update.
---
Has anyone experienced something similar to this? Is this something I should be worried about and open a support ticket, or should I just ignore this and try another day?
---
There is not currently, and there never will be, a single build that's "the best" for all types of content. If that's a game breaker for you, then it's time to move along. Different game modes require different capabilities. That's why we use the word "different". If every game mode required the same capabilities, they would all be the same game mode.
---
I'll enter with my reddit name! Thanks for running the giveaway :)

---
The BL store has been notoriously slow and choppy for a few days to a week or so now; it may just be an extension of that. fwiw I bought some gems earlier this evening with no issues (other than forgetting my card number) but I have been noticing the performance issues recently.

Entering w/ Reddit name. (Why did you think people would want to publicly post their account names? :P)
---
They should be adding loot drop to other meta events if they want to us to do other metas, make them worth while ! Look at the metas that aren't played, look at the items that are farmed then add them to the drop pool and make the drop rate the same. Anet can then limit stuff per event forcing players to move from map to map for their loot farms, if that's what they want us to do and not just limit a single event hoping that we move on to do something else!
---

---
Amazing art &lt;3 see stuff like this are the unexpected thing that keeps the subreddit interesting. 
---
The new Art Sunday thing is bound to make the subreddit miserable and stale. 
---
Ugh ok here goes. My original reply to this was a lot of emotion and not a lot of thought so I’ve changed it to this instead. I appreciate that you’ve thought about this but I don’t think this is the solution at all. I’m an artist so you may say I’m biased but hey. Here are my points as to why I think this is a bad idea: 
---
- What really is “Unique and special” this is extremely subjective and seems not the best thing to base a rule on. This is toxic and could lead to a lot of bad feeling as when someone posts they are told it’s not good enough, whereas another post could have been allowed that is subjectively worse. Even if that’s not the intention of the rule it is the implication. 
---
- One of two things will happen on Sunday, there’s too much art, increasing competition between artists but also limiting people’s interest as there will be so much art on that day that they will be oversaturated and uninterested, or artists will be discouraged to post art at all and there will just be limited art on Sunday’s and none the rest of the time. 
---
- New artists will feel unwelcome, they won’t know about this rule and may post art on another day, only to be told to post on Sunday which will feel really bad, and they likely won’t. 
---
- You don’t get more discussion suddenly by banning art, you just get less art and the same amount of discussion. 
---
On top of this really this seems like an overreaction. Looking at the current best posts on the subreddit there is so much variety. There’s art, characters, discussion, it looks fine to me. 
---
I know you’ve said this is an experiment and I really hope that’s true because it seems like a hasty solution.
---
First of all we need some more information, what do you even want to do witht that rotation???
---
- Boonshare??
---
- DPS??

- Something totaly different

I have such a hard time dressing up my medium armor characters because of stuff like this. I like agile, aggressive looking armor, but there's virtually nothing that fits this, a lot of the problem being the overabundance of rigid coats, skirts, and and flaps, along with the bulky boots, shoulders, and gauntlets.  
---
The (leyline armor)[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Leystone_armor_(medium)_human_female_front.jpg] is a perfect example of this. The skirt, boots, gloves... just so out of place.  
---
And then take a look at (the base legendary armor)[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Perfected_Envoy_armor_(medium)_human_female_front.jpg]. It doesn't have a coat in that form, but oh man do the boots, helmet, and shoulder clash with the stripped down top and legs.  
---
Every time I go and try to make an outfit I keep running into the same issues, and it leaves me feeling so dissatisfied.

---
Hello, thanks for this kind act!
---
Also, I'd like to enter with my reddit name.
---
Btw, that website is outdated, it misses three fractals.
---
Fractals, where you generally need more than one player to deal with mechanics together: Thaumanova reactor (maze, quarters, heat room), Uncategorized (Switches after stairs), Cliffside (hammer), Aetherblade (security system switches), Swampland (wisps).
---
That being said, most if not all mechanics can be dealt with with fewer players, if they know how to and have the right class for it.
---
With three player minimum in your party, you can handle all mechanics easily.
---
PvP system is not bad at all.
---
There are two modes, first is WvW, which stands for World vs World vs World, where fights are even in size of like 70 vs 70 vs 70...All the chat is visible only for your team, so that keeps most of salt contained. It just works and can be a lot of fun, especially when you join commander on voice chat.
---
Second gamemode is instanced "arena" pvp, 5vs5, and has standardized stats and everything, seasonal ranked mode to play against people with same ranking...there people can use chats, but well...it is still just very contained from other people :)
---
What people mostly complain is probably that the modes would need more new stuff and more players (but where this isn't the case?), and on balance ....while the balance is not so really bad at all, we got new stuff just recently for pvp, and big rework for wvw is coming hopefully soon....so that's it.
---
This looks excellent!
---
That's the whole point of this video. The build is obviously great and yet people aren't informed about how great it is because it's not yet featured on metabattle. 
---
It did, but it was not good enough.
---
I'd like to use my reddit name if that's okay. Thank you for doing this.
---
Hello, i'm really getting into WvW lately, is there a WvW live map design i can use on the background of my pc? 
---
something i can see at work how my server is doing in the background?
---
I enter with my reddit name. thanks.
---
I play during OCX times on NA, I rarely see map metas being done around my times. I have like 1-2 shots to maybe get it. I’ve had to endure near fails of DS though. Oh, and first burn DS not even reach 75%. Istan I never get during current iteration, not enough people. The change just makes me kinda give up on it now.
---
I'll use my reddit name for the giveaway. Thanks for doing it! 
---
It somehow very much reminds me of Nilfgaardian armour style.

Which is very much a very trendy look, so I do approve! :3

Amazing! Shame they took the sub to the backyard and shot it in the head #ProtestArtSunday
---
I approve. I regularly visit this, the WoW and FFXIV subreddits for game discussion, but the amount of "fanart", particularly on the FFXIV sub (which has it's own sub for FFXIV art, but the mods allow it to be flooded with half naked cat girls for some reason) that pushes actual discussion away from the front page is kinda irritating. The art is usually beautiful and some artists are definitely skilled, but it's not really the place for it. There are dedicated sites for artists and admirers to post, the amount of "look at my Sylvari I got commissioned isn't she so cute?" and then a ton of people parroting the same reply and a commercial link to the artist isn't really anything to do with GW2.
---
*Hope can be powerful, but also dangerous.*
---
Huh, reddit name is fine for me.

Huzzah! XD

Cool! Thanks for setting this up. If this is open to EU as well, I'd like to sign up using my reddit name =D
---
If you don't mind carrying multiple sets of gear, Guardian works quite well in open world and PvE. Dragonhunter has party utility and burst dps for group content. Firebrand can focus on condition damage or party boons.
---
If you are looking for a single build, with a single set of gear for all game modes, you'll have to compromise somewhere. Vipers Scourge is decent in PvE, but a bit squishy for WvW. Mirage is infuriating in WvW, but more situational in PvE.
---
I want to enter with my reddit name :) ty kind tyrian
---
Woah that's Nike?
---
Been out of the raiding scene for a while and just checking up on the latest drama. He really said all that? wtf
---
It depends on goals and expectations.  Simply put?  We have none for newbies other than we hope that they have fun.  When you start to push into content where people at a certain experience level (eg; T3/T4 Fractals) *should* know better, but don't - that causes issues such as frustrating or occasionally causes someone to lash out.  Player vs. player can get pretty heated too.  WvW isn't really all that welcoming to new players unless they're willing to make it their "core" game-mode either. 
---
I imagine they'd be much like the Zephyrites and Exalted though, in terms of personality. And I don't think we need a third group of fanatics towards the peaceful dragon.
---
Would look cool, but it'd be something I'd see for a "many years later" scenario. If GW3 ever becomes a thing, and Aurene does indeed return, some "peace-brand" faction would be cool background to build up.
---
This is fun! Reddit name I guess 😁

Not all heroes wear caps. REDDIT NAME HERE &lt;3

Evidence? My man, you didn't have any to begin with.

Only 46 people voted on OP and there were at least 172 people who supported the opinion of the guy you "argued" with. This alone leaves me with more evidence than you will ever have unless you're going to pretend that these people are stupid and it's not the poster's fault if absolute majority "didn't get the joke".

I do wonder if it could have been some kind of lag timing it out or something. I did decide to put in a support ticket and figure out what's up, but it's at least good to know it's been slow for others if that's indeed the issue.
---
what is metabattle?
---
I'm signing up with reddit name :D thank you!
---
Yet you felt the need to express you don't know them, can't help to wonder why.
---
Oof ♿
---
maybe what we need is an overhaul of the story journal. multiple difficulties (like a medium difficulty where theres fail states.), repeatable rewards, dailies.
---
but also make the personal story repeatable in the story journal just like season 2 onward.
---
Nice and generous of you, can I join with my Reddit name as well? :)
---
Please use my reddit name as well~ thank you :3
---
I only have 16 characters right now.. I need more...
---
Gw2 is CPU single threaded heavy. So even though probably Ryzen 5 CPU are better value for money on this budget, if the main thing you would do is Gw2 you are better off with a 4 core i5 CPU. 
---
Check this and look for the i5 or i7 that has the best single threaded performance, for your budget, and you should be good.
---
As for GPU anything equal or more powerful than an RX570 or an GF1060 should be more than enough for gw2 on 1080p. 
---
Well, sign me up with my reddit name then!
---
So since you already have all the BL skins, why not set up a real orchestra? You just need enough chars ;) 
---
Been gone for a while, is Dhuum's orb phase any more high-ping-friendly than it was on release?
---
&gt;You can just get the orbs by going in front of them
---
Didn't ask, I'm strictly wondering if Anet has changed anything, such as making it client side or similar (as I understand the "risks" with making it client side).
---
Same question essentially applies to the orbs in Nightmare Fractal.
---
Reddit name. Thanks for the giveaway
---
Maybe you just didn't start playing at launch. Memes aside DnT was probably the most influential PvE guild between 2012 and early 2016 (1st raid launch). Then they kinda fell off.
---
Also DnT is NA and SC is EU.
---
I'd like to sign up with my reddit name, too.
---
Thanks for making this Giveaway! :)
---
If I log off I cant say I keep playing the game therefore I lose my right to complain.
---
Now I avg about 10h day logged in and I afk for at least 7 of them.
---
Thank you for doing this, I absolutely adore those weaponskins!

Path of Fire established that a god cannot replace the Elder Dragons' placement in The All. So Dwayna's off the table.
---
The Pale Tree should be capable, the only countering argument being "she's not a dragon".
---
Kuunavang and other Saltspray "dragons" are more akin to wyverns in appearance, and no known relation to the Elder Dragons and their twelve spheres of magic, so it's unclear if they can replace Elder Dragons.
---
All the same, we have the Forgotten's ritual of purifying dragon minions from Arah, and we know from Siren's Landing that the minions of dead Elder Dragons regain their own free will, so it is plausible we could convert an Unchained dragon to goodness and have them replace Zhaitan, like Tequatl nearly did, even if only scions are capable of replacing Elder Dragons.
---
But how they established The All Season 3 and Path of Fire, we will need more than just Aurene. What will destroy the world is The All's imbalance, the death of a third Elder Dragon. Thus we cannot have some "Ultimate Elder Prismatic Dragon"; we always needed 1-5 more replacements besides Aurene (1 as a bare minimum to also kill the DSD along with Kralk; 3 as a bare minimum if we're killing all remaining Elder Dragons; 5 if we replace all and have a nice buffer in case our friendly Elder Dragons are a) killed by greedy bad guys or b) go rogue and need putting down).
---
This question is best for actual anet support, but if you're still able to log in without the SMS code, it's likely that you have it set to only text you when you try to log in from a new IP address or a different machine, in which case logging in from the same ip address and same machine does not trigger the SMS code. 
---
If you can't log in, contact support.
---
Are you seriously threatening to ban people from /r/guildwars2 for posting a comment that you don't like? You're the janitor here, not the supreme communist leader. 
---
Downvoted.
---
Reddit name please :)
---
Toot! I just post me account name right? 
---
diddydgp.1627
---
But that would be a nerf to the rewards from all of the other living story maps just to bring the out-of-line map back in-line.  Completely contrary to the seemingly intended goal of reducing differences in the maps. 
---
Most of playerbase don't even probably do high tier fractals, they consider open world "hard enough" content and enjoy exploring world, story and similar stuff
---
It's been awhile since I played it, I forgot about that part. Though I remember it being a complete surprise that she did that. I may have missed something in the build up to it, though. Planning on bringing my husband through the story sometime soon, looking forward to reliving it. :)
---
Goodluck everyone!
---
I'll enter with my reddit name. :D 
---
Awesome :D reddit name here or Hawkray.9105 iirc
---
You need 48 Jewels to complete the weapon collection containing 208 total AP. People will be completing those this week, which should drop attendance further.
---
Well he still goes to school there’s your answer 
---
Try in r/guildrecruitment
---
Thanks, I will do that. Wanted to see if other people were having the same problem first.
---
He's always been this way.  Back in HoT beta when they were given exclusive access to test raids, they made posts and videos claiming they had world first boss kills as if beta mattered for anything.
---
Imagine if Method or any hardcore WoW guild claimed a world first victory over a boss or raid from a fucking beta.
---
I've been sitting with my tag at the market waypoint and LFG open for about 5 hours now.
---
Next meta starts in 12 minutes from posting this, and we're 9 people :P
---
Reddit name, thanks.
---
I'm new to the game so IDK what an orchestral weapon is or if I can use it but if it's something I might want I'd like to enter under my Reddit name.  If it's something I won't be able to use disregard this, I don't want to take it from someone else.
---
I never get lucky with such draws but since I'm a returning player, why not? Please sign me up with my Reddit account name!
---
Sweet! Unfortunately I'm at work atm, so i'll wish you gl!
---
Its badly optimized. It needs alot of processing power(cpu). 
---
When you enter a zerg(a huge pile of dudes), you have to render all their characters, it takes a toll. 
---
Lower character details and it should help for zergs. 
---
Came here for some maths, wasn't disappointed 
---
Hide me
---
Char Model Limit. The game just doesn't handle very well "largue" amounts of people, no matter if you have a 300€ GPU or a 3k+€ one. You will only notice performance increase while playing with less people around.
---
Funny how you find 50 fps a trouble running the game.
---
Reduce character model limit and reflections and you should see big improvements.
---
The arenanet/gw2 Twitter often mentions what's on sale each day in the gem store. Maybe you can take a look there. 
---
This stuff is honestly fine, but the people posting tons of screenshots of their characters are a little annoying. 
---
I'm telling you it is. Even abilities like whirlwind/charge on warrior break, as in don't go full range motion..
---
I'll use my Reddit name to enter as well. Thank you!
---
Ok guys everyone report this amazing art because of the new rule for artwork only on Sunday /s.
---
No really, this is what the mods want people to do, smh. 
---
&gt;250GB M.2 2280 NVMe PCIe 3.0 (SSD) 70$ This will speed up the game very good.
---
This does not speed up the game. It speeds up loading times. Not the FPS. 
---
&gt;1 AMD Ryzen 5 2600X 6x 3.60GHz 200$ (The game uses just 1/3)
---
It uses 1/3 cause of the 12 threads and the game cannot use them all. But how much of a single thread is it used. In zergs a single thread is close to 80%. CPUs with less core but higher frequencies per core would do a better job.  
---
Wow! This is awesome. I'll enter now with my reddit name, please!
---
Hearts are character bound and you get 25 for map completion. The exotic ones only cost 60 BM each, so if you hold off on making ascended, that's less than 4 stacks. Unlocking the collections would run another 1600, but then you don't need to do the meta. Anyone out to make a full set of exotics and ascended would need 96 Jewels, which should keep them farming for another 3-4 weeks.
---
I guess that’s the wrong word, mainly addressing the dips. Never consistent.
---
I’d like to use my reddit name, thanks for the giveaway is very nice of you :)
---
I'll usr my reddit name pls
---
It's likely the number of characters that are showing. Other comments have it right. Turn the character model limit to the lowest it will go and turn off post processing. I find post processing and the character models to be the worst fps offenders.
---
Also if we kill him without Aurene, we destroy the world as well. Unless they pull something out of thin air. 
---
Ah, good old wow raiding uis.
---
As much as I love your work, you really should have waited till sunday to post this, We need to keep this sub free of amazing post like this for all the important discussions taking place about the game on the front page /s
---
If you read the thread you can probably assume its NSFW. Also the 'gone wild' part of the name gives it away
---
Gotcha will give that a try when I get to my puter 
---
I use some of my alts as a bank half the time.
---
Awesome work! Keep it up! :) Do some Kralkatorrik or Aurene! 
---
I'll sign up with reddit name amongst all the others. Cheers!
---
Thanks for the giveaway, use my reddit name :&gt;
---
I'll enter with Bestari.9805 
---
From experience commanding: It appears every 30-40 minutes. Kinda random, and each map appears to have a different timer. Not a reliable timer.
---
xINothing.9561
---
So that's why my google sheet kept throwing a bunch of errors.
---
I get real tired of reading that "badly optimized" bullshit exaggeration.
---
Is it extremely optimized? No! Can it be? No! It runs on an older engine.
---
Is it "badly optimized"? No! Just because it's not the best it can be, does not make it one of the worst (not even close)...and that's what "badly optimized" comes off as.
---
Considering what's in your immediate environment, obviously your performance will dip...especially in a MMORPG that has to constantly load other player's data and render it for you.
---
I'm on a 8700k with 1080ti, and I can maintain a steady 55-80 fps WITH gw2hook and high settings on extremely populated zones like cities or...better yet, Mistlock Sanctuary.
---
If one expects performance similar to a single player game or a game with extremely limited visual or player clutter then they are living a dream. Compare a Ferrari to a Lamborghini, not a Toyota - that's stupid.
---
to make places viable enough so when i feel like doing certain content it doesnt seem dead and i wouldnt need to multi-server guild to try to do it or take hours to gather a team on lfg my example is world bosses, they still going since day 1, but why the newest meta events (pof metas) are not like that?
---
Thats just you being overly sensible about this. Compared to most games, its badly optimized, thats it, its not aweful or not normal to be badly optimized because of the engine, but it doesnt run as well as newer games on good pc. 
---
ronaldo.6418
---
TY
---
Good for you man! I'll sign up with my reddit name.
---
Eh, the main barrier is the people you play with, not your own gear and skill level. I can have six raid-ready fully ascended characters to fill every role, top DPS against multiple bosses, and still feel like raids are inaccessible to me because it requires too much commitment and coordination with people I barely know. So, I only raid with my guild/friends, but then there isn’t always enough folks interested in trying raids to consistently get a 10-man squad. So you LFG it, which is hit or miss.
---
Message changed slightly:
---
&gt;#GW2Spidy might be shutting down!  
---
&gt;After 6 years of running GW2Spidy we've reached the point where I might need to shutdown the project. 
---
&gt;The server that has been running GW2Spidy is looking like it's about to die and I don't have the time or energy to move the project to a new server (which is a huge effort, considering the 60GB database). 
---
&gt;**I'll try to save the server and keep it running, but it's a 50/50 chance ...**  
---
&gt;In case it dies, I want to thank all the users, specially the early day users and contributors, it's been such a fun project thanks to all of you &lt;3 
---
&gt;I'm sorry for all the people who are still using GW2Spidy, I hope I can keep things alive!
---
yeah, gw2 is doing well and the xpacs go on sale pretty often.
---
IMHO GW2 is kind of dying right now. It still has it's casual crowd, but if you're into dungeons (Fractals), sPvP or raiding this game is probably not for you, as you will blast through the content and burn out on it in a few months. PvP queues are filled with wintraders and match manipulators as soon as you get past 1500 rating.  
---
On the other hand if you're into fashionwars or a completionist, you'll probably find alot of fun in GW2, as it has tons of skins and a huge world to explore and "complete".
---
/quote  This does not speed up the game in general. It speeds up loading times. Not the FPS. 
---
Thats actually right and wrong. The engine loads allways at the background. With less time to load you gain fps because of the "idle time". Those causes "lags" in WvW or Lionkeep. And you want to see your enemy as soon as possible, right? 
---
2:
---
All other programm were closed. I know, gw2 uses more single core (See at core 2), but not just only 1. You can gain more Freq with Intel, but the rest (less amount of cores) you will suffer. 
---
Still the answer is yes. GW2 still is not dead or being murdered. Having the base game still gives you a lot of content and your account wouldn't have F2P restrictions inless you're on a new account? Anyway enjoy! xD
---
I feel like a big part of this is the moderation team for this sub. Some other gaming subs I've been to are in a constant state of chaos, and you can tell that the mods there just aren't able to (or don't want to) clean things up.
---
Yeah i've read the section "its not working". But nvm its working now, i did it. Thanks anyway
---
&gt;while the balance is not so really bad at all
---
We have seen what diversity GW1 had for viable builds. Compare to GW2 where you need certain boons, or invuln, or evade just to survive, and you will see that balance is actually PvP's biggest problem.
---
That being said, yes, at least PvP is a level playing field. :}
---
&gt;The mindset of "players should get good" is very out of date as well.
---
That is why there is a mentality of "the game should make you good". It's called good level design.
---
the difference with guild wars is that some classes are completely useless in some cases. For every game mode. In other mmos you know what to expect because of the holy trinity. and i enjoy being healer which is why its hard to choose between druid and guardian alone
---
Heya, I would be super happy if you could include me in your give-away (reddit name)
---
I have been wanting to get some of these skins for a while now but unfortunately I blew all my money on minstrel gear... oh, the struggle :)
---
Anyways, thank you and have a great day! :D
---
Hey! I want to enter with my reddit name too! Thanks for your awesome generosity :D
---
I will do so good sir Nazak.1859 is my name add me in game if anyone wants to play together just started with an asura engineer
---
Amazing! 
---
This, so much. People have the mentality that we have to hit exactly competitive benchmarks and skip mechanics to win. I raid as a Power Necro in ascended gear and I've cleared Keep Construct, Xera, VG, Gorseval, Escort and Cairn. 
---
Thing is, I don't have time enough each week to wait for some discord training group to go and tell me what to do, so I read guides and watch videos. BUT since I'm barely starting that makes me "not good enough" to join most groups. I remember this one group, the one I cleared Gorseval with, that was angry because the group didn't had DPS enough to skip the last soul attack, so I purposed the team to stop trying to skip mechanic and do the encounter normally. By doing this, we won, and people still was angry because WE COULDN'T SKIP.
---
I call them inaccessible because a very hermetic community has formed around them. I have played WoW and FFXIV and those games gave me the tools to learn to raid by trial and error, without needing to alt tab to read guides and enter youtube unless it was absolutely necessary and I couldn't understand a mechanic. 
---
GW2 raids aren's particulary complex but they have some quite obscure mechanics, and not enough people is willing to try them because they either had to attend to third party softwares to look for tutors, or are told otherwise by the very toxic community that has formed in them.
---
I see that has not changed one bit then. I always enjoyed events more than hearts anyway!
---
[The Awakened Abomination](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/GnvYa) is the greatest creature design in Guild Wars - fight me irl.
---
[All or Nothing mild Spoiler](#s "Fighting alongside a friendly Abomination during the final fight made me squeal like a little kid.")
---
I think the higher problem is that they over-rely on killing characters off for drama. Blish is gone as of last episode, basegame endgame was literally filled with 'introduce character then kill them off' etc.
---
I'd enter with my account name but I'm not home to know the numbers so I'll enter with my reddit account.
---
I'm still upset over the incoming Istan nerf because I've never had more fun memeing with the people in map chat there and now I have to find somewhere else to entertain myself ):&lt;
---
:(  gw2spidy
---
Aw yeah, finally a chance at transcribing my real life skills into guild wars that I can afford! Been smirking at those instruments, but at the same time my gem balance smirks back at me
---
Kozuki.3951
---
wow thank you so much ! I would love the mace or the staff. My account name is  yoyo.9254
---
Yooo signing up with my Reddit account name :) thanks for the give away!
---
Yeah true...Probably a 1050ti should be also good. 
---
Try out Harrier Firebrand in PvE. Hand out boons like candy and lots of small heals. Main difficulty is keeping people in range.
---
Except on days when the Daily asks you to complete events in low-level areas, and you have 3 people that keep engaging on enemy spawns with mounts, killing them instantly and not moving on after to a new event, but competing to kill the most spawns and preventing others from getting any tags/credit...
---
That's possibly the only way I've found for people to purposefully screw over other players, though I don't even want to assume malice in it (I think people just don't get that it isn't *necessary* to do that)
---
This, though it should be noted 
---
Their devs have said that they have the tools &amp; tech now to add many things that would normally be "expansion" worthy via living world &amp; do so in much less time then it would have taken a year or 2 ago.
---
Since gear is no issue simply play all of them? Ascended gear is accountbound and can be stat swapped via the mystic toilet to fulfill its needs if you dont like an particular character anymore.
---
Don't build a computer for GW2 this game will run horrible on any PC once you get enough people on screen.Just make a good all rounder setup.
---
Nobody blames you, dont you worry one second x3
---
Finishing off living world season 4 and a few episodes of season 5 I would imagine. Wouldn’t expect an expansion until late 2020 if there is going to be another one. Gw3? Maybe sometime
---
Main reason I am going ranger for the moment is because I never really played a ranger "back in the day" - my two mains were a Guardian and a Thief (the latter of which I am definitely planning to recreate, as even in my GW1 days I was an Assassin main - and the name of that Assassin became, among other things, my Reddit name). 
---
I am currently playing with a longbow/greatsword, so that suits me fine. As for expansions, I am definitely intending to pick those up, any indication of an impending sale? 
---
&gt;pvp is where most of the salt is but it's small compared to pve community.
---
With all the bots around and anet giving zero fucks, dead would be the right word here.
---
Reddit name, please. And good luck to all!
---
This feature has worked greatly in world of warcraft /sarcasm off
---
Ppl will still shout in mapchats and it wont change the overall problem of that. As it is a single advertisement vs many mapchat chances
---
Oh really? I did not know that. I will have to start trying to get some. Does Ascended gear come from everything or only specific activities?
---
I play 7-8 of the classes on a given day.  One of the main reasons I like GW2 is it is alt friendly.  Other MMOs have you pick a main class or role since gearing is such a pain/grind.  GW2 this isn't a problem so play as many of the classes/builds you like.
---
As i said on another thread. I did all last chapter of main story with that horrible popup. I know your feel bro.
---
it's because you haven't seen the toxicity yet. it exists, just as prevalent as other mmos. people tend to see a couple nice people and assume everyone is like that, it's just luck. there are plenty of toxic people on this sub and in game, all you gotta do is disagree with them and out it pours.
---
Living world, GW3 is very unlikely this is my one problem with GW2 they make a sequel and that sets a precedent where people expect a new game every few years.
---
JohnkingVIII.4718
---
Pretty common sadly.
---
Because whoever's job it is at the company doesn't know how to make rewarding content after 6+ years and wants to keep their players playing for blues and greens /snore. 
---
It was very ambiguous whether it was a legit blessing or just words but later additions clarified that it was a legit blessing.
---
I don’t really have a main either and I’ve played for years. Just play what you want at the time, you’ll be getting materials and account bound stuff along the way
---
Try to focus on the content rather than the class for a while. Pick one of those that suit you best and just enjoy the content.
---
Additionally, gw2 i a very alt friendly game, so there are no boundaries for having many characters and still enjoy the game, even more.
---
Each class excels in a different area, meaning you can have one for pvp, one for wvw, one for metas, fractals, etc, etc ;) 
---
Hope it helps, cheers!
---
2(3) new legendaries and a mount with the next LS update.
---
LS provides similar "expansion level contents" (like new mounts), though delivered in little chunks, without needing expansion.
---
There is no expansion planned for 2019. Earliest expansion will be late 2020.
---
There is no GW3 planned for the near future. GW2 is simply going to continue evolving, as it has for the past 7 years.
---
I say that GW2's balance is more on 5vs5 scale than on 1vs1 scale, and many don't just get it and rage out when they can't solowin against pure dueling builds that are made to win 1vs1. Also there is a lot of rock-paper-scissors situations, where the solution is not to engage and get an ally with you...or swap the spots with other ally...
---
In most games you get mirrored, or nearly mirrored classes and it is something comparable, even though some people just run special builds to crack some certain other builds, while they are potentially weak against other builds. It is maybe just relying on matchmaking rng, and most "meta" builds are meta mainly to minimize this rng, but that's it. There is way bigger difference in player skills than in classes.
---
Just sent a message!
---
it's not buy to play anymore, its f2p
---
What's wrong with the server? I'm facing 3k pings or something and I can't even execute my abilities. This is frustrating.
---
Entering with Reddit name
---
Haven’t finished the story yet but it’s long enough that I started to wonder if there is any reason to do it on multiple characters. Some of the rewards aren’t bad, but I’m wondering if I’d be missing anything by skipping to the expansions or endgame on boosted alts once I finish the story on one char.
---
I’m pretty sure gw2 will be around for at least a few more years. Maybe they’ll do gw3 at some point but who knows. Play the free version for a bit and see if you want to get invested, there’s plenty to access while you’re waiting for a sale. 
---
They would likely diversify their product line-up not keep making Guildwars over and over again. There's nothing they cant do to 2 that they need a 3 for. If anything we'll finish up tyria at some point and go to Cantha to "start over" story wise.
---
For me it always comes down to which class do I enjoy playing the most, what kind of player I am, and which of those classes fit that role the most. Granted for me I also add which class fits me personality wise (in my own opinion). And for me that would be guardian. More specifically a support guardian cause I try my best to help support the people I am playing with.
---
So to that end I do suggest sitting back and mauling over such questions. Maybe even asking which class do you see yourself sticking with. Heck, you could even consider having more than one main but for different game modes. Like one for PvE content, one for PvP, and one for WvW.
---
Sorez.1675, thanks! &lt;3
---
The thing is, just about how often do you go to those art subreddits? On the occasion someone links it in a comment? I made a comment regarding this exact sentiment about the d&amp;d sub. That game is about story telling and rarely about fashion, where gw2 here it's a huge component to playing this game. Art is and forever will exist when character customization exists in a visual game
---
Reddit name. Thanks my person. 
---
Guild Wars 2 PvP is some of the best out there, IMO, for someone who wants to have fun and get rewards. Some tips/things to know in no particular order.
---
1. Unranked. As a new player, you are "forced" to play unranked until you reach PvP rank 20. Use this time to play lots of classes, try lots of builds, etc. All classes have very strong builds for PvP. Check out Metabattle for builds and tweak them as you see fit. See how they work in unranked.
---
2. Learn the maps and learn how to play PvP. PvP is mostly about ignoring the capture nodes until the enemy players are dead and on respawn. While you're playing, pay attention to the mini-map and try and avoid coming to fights that are already in your favor, numberswise (also, for entertainment, count how many times a smarter player on the enemy team manages to trick 3-4 of your teammates into chasing them around the map while the rest of their team caps points uncontested). Spend your time in unranked like this, and you're pretty much guaranteed to not be useless. If YOU are smart enough to not follow the 4 teammates chasing the enemy thief and, instead, cap a point, then you're being exponentially more useful.
---
3. Getting clobbered. You're going to have bad engagements and get clobbered sometimes. The trick is what you learn from that. Did you die because suddenly 3 people were on top of you? First off, good for you for dragging 3 players away from another point/engagement and making the rest of the map easier for your team. Second, did they actually sneak up on you or did you not pay attention to the mini-map to see where they might be coming from? Is there anything about your positioning that made it more likely that you'd get jumped? Did you die because the other person is putting out a crazy amount of damage? Consider either looking up ways of countering that build in the future (protection uptime, watching for animation wind-ups, condition clearing) OR consider running that class and trying out some high damage builds on it and trying to replicate what that player did to you. This may find you a class you're more comfortable on or at the very least show you what the other class does so you know how to counter it on other classes.
---
4. Rage trolls. The game has a block feature as well as a report feature for verbal abuse. I honestly have not met many people like this (full disclosure, I've probably raged more times because my team doesn't pay attention to the map/positioning than I have gotten rage) though I play fairly casually most of the time. What you tend to see more are passive trolls. I.E. people who give up after one engagement because your team got wiped.
---
5. Rewards. Okay, you got through all this rambling. Let me let you in on Guild Wars 2's biggest secret: Ranked PvP is one of the easiest and best gold farms in the game (\*provided they don't change things today). You earn rewards in PvP and WvW through "Reward tracks". These progress whenever you play PvP in ranked or unranked. These get you things like dungeon-exclusive skins, valuable materials, etc. Already pretty rewarding, right? WELL. Go into ranked and you begin progressing a second reward system in the form of League rewards. This only progresses during an active PvP season (it starts today!) and resets after the season is over. You make progress through different colored chests based on wins/losses. Wins give you \~10 "pips" of progress, losses still give you \~4 "pips". So you can lose every single game and, so long as you're not an asshole doing it intentionally, you can still get great rewards. What are they? Well starting off each time you cross a threshold, you get 30 silver and a transmutation charge (how you re-skin existing gear, actually pretty rare in PvE). Not great, right? Well the final threshold in just that starting chest gives you 5 gold! Along with other goodies. By the time you reach the final chest (honestly not hard even if all you do is log in once and play a game or two to get your dailies, which is another 2 gold for like 15 minutes of work) you earn 1 gold, 50 silver every threshold and a whopping 20 gold at the end. Oh, also, you earn enough boxes of Grandmaster Marks to buy a piece of ascended (end-game best-possible gear) for almost nothing.
---
TL:DR: Learn the game in unranked, block anyone who's toxic, and get those crazy rewards.

The way Anet has written it has told us that can't happen, though. Ever since the first hints that killing ED is bad back in Season 2, all the way up to the end of PoF where Taimi states that Kralkatorrik getting evem stronger will further imbalance The All.
---
I don't think Aurene must be the one to replace Kralkatorrik, though she's still the most likely one for it.
---
Sure, cause he not wanting to do the bare minimum to not be a complete burden to his team is being toxic. Riiight.
---
So, i have an idea. Grab other 9 people who doesn't want to pass the dps check for raid guilds and start your own team, everyone wins. 
---
I don’t think I really agree, the engine is pretty old at this point, the basics of the combat and skill system is still something that a lot of gw1 vets don’t like, it wouldn’t surprise me if there was a gw3 that takes some lessons from both games in the next 3-5 years
---
Same way rev channels dead legends I suppose.
---
I feel, or at least I hope that they talk about it after finishing the current living story season. We only know there will be another season instead of a expansion but we don't know how many episodes it will have nor every how much time they will come.
---
I'd love an QoL update as some years ago. (And new hairstyles/faces)

Are you sure that you're being bottlenecked by your GPU? 
---
I am playing on an Ultrawide 3440x1440 myself and I have the same problem as you do. My graphics card is RX480 8GB, my CPU Ryzen 1700@3.9ghz. Would be interesting to know what is limiting the FPS in general play.
---
By the way once you go 1440p there is no turning back. The game looks so much better even in low/medium settings.
---
This sounds like fun.

You can use my reddit name. Thanks for the great event :-)

Oh. Sorry, I read 2029 for some reason.

Ascended can be crafted once you hit 500 in a craft, gained through certain Achievements, bought with Living World currencies (Rings, Backpacks, etc), and dropped in Fractals (there may be a few other sources, but these are what I rely on).
---
It's the "highest tier" of equipment (barring Legendary, which is essentially Ascended but with the added benefit of being able to stat-swap at whim.) You can even change the stats on your Ascended gear if you want through the Mystic Forge (except Rings, Amulets, Backpacks). All Ascended gear is Account Bound, so if you get a set of Berserkers Medium Armor for your Ranger for example, you can *also* use it on your Engineer.
---
But legends are dead, so he just channels them through the Mists. Gods are not dead though.

Depending on your luck, somewhere between meh, and monumentally bad :|
---
There is a lot of things FF14 has I wish gw2 would implement, but that’s just wishful thinking. 
---
No, no. This criticism applies to all modes. There is no standard for balance when professions define the role, not vice versa. Those classes I mentioned are overtuned even for PvE because they have roles that are class-distinct. Whereas in traditional MMOs, the balance revolves around roles, the balance here is less well defined because there is no definition of what a role is supposed to do or really even what each profession's role is. In ArenaNet's balance paradigm, they have Firebrand as a specialized support role, but there's no internal balance rule stating that say Mesmer has to be just as adept at healing as any other class because there are no defined roles.   
---
In GW1 for example, both Monks and Ritualists were pretty much the only professions who could heal. So, to some degree, they had to be balanced against each other. In the end, the Monk tended to be more adaptable and versatile and the classes were not necessarily balanced there in a true sense either, but these two classes did have distinct support roles that they competed for so they did have to be balanced against each other. This is not necessarily the case between say Mesmer and Ranger, fundamentally different classes and only one of them is considered a profession with a "healer" capacity.  
---
So, in this context, the specialization isn't "broken" if there are no distinguished roles that all classes should be able to evenly compete for. However, if their balance goal is to allow each profession to be able to heal and output the same boons equally (which they haven't stated as being the case), then you may have a case for the Firebrand being over-tuned and outperforming in heals. Each class brings its own unique mechanics and Firebrand just happens to excel at Quickness, healing, etc through it's profession mechanics (tomes) and utilities. Now, if this role was at all intended to be available or balanced across professions, the professions would have equal access to these support capacities and healing skills, which they clearly don't, meaning that there is no fundamentally coherent balance inherent to the profession design, because, again, roles are not a coherent design construct in GW2.  
---
I've been playing since closed beta, I've got nearly 3,000 hours played, max masteries, 15kAP, nearly 40k gold account value, and consistently place and maintain plat rank in pvp each season. And that's not even counting my GW1 playtime or achievements so "casual" doesn't accurately describe my experience with the GW franchise.

make a pvp tournament, fashion contest, a lore quiz etc and make them win prices^^
---
Because programming and creating something (the programmer), which somebody else envisions (the company in general) is a task that can't be put in a timeframe. It's like having a boss ask "how long will this problem which hasn't been solved before, but doesn't look too complicated take to fix?"  
---
Programmer: "We don't know, only god knows. But I estimate 2 hours." -it then turns out a simple function call which needs to be replaced is hardcoded almost everywhere in the system, which will hinder progress until solved, and which will take about 2 weeks to resolve, not counting the QA or any potential bug fixes, which arise due to some interns programming which relied on the bug we're fixing.  
---
In total 2 hours turned into 2 months.
---
As a Programmer, I can tell you, it's not out of the loop, but sometimes we don't want to be the assholes that cry doom due to not knowing how long it will take create something new out of nothing.
---
It's hellish hard, and often we overestimate ourselves due to experiencing a few lucky strokes, which turns into us giving a wrong timeframe for task which are actually harder than we initially experienced.
---
Also, finding quality programmers is pretty hard... so even if you have the money to expand, finding the people with the experience is next to impossible.
---
PS: "Me and others enjoy it so fuck the rest who has other interests? Ahh, I see. " -- that one part was personal opinion. Like seeing the positive side of things, rather than being all negative and 'fuck this game, it's in maintenance'.
---
(Just for a moment, imagine being a GW2 programmer who's now dedicated to following the current vision, overworked and reading these chats. Think it's motivating?)
---
That would mean there's no need for more than one class in the game. Not going to happen.
---
Solaris.4972, thanks for this!
---
Then don't.  It's really that simple.  
---
I agree with you, game engine is doing great and must be very well optimized else it would not be running at all after all these years yet they keep adding new features to it, like phasing that came to it with A Bug in the System episode.
---
It's more like people confusing game engine's architectural limitations to being badly optimized. 
---
Thanks for doing this! I’d like to sign up with my Reddit name :)
---
True. I did forget about RP. And as for Fractals I kind of put that under PvE even though granted it has its own special mechanic and some people get super focused into Fractals. Personally I dislike them and honestly wish Anet would maybe Revamp Fractals too but that is a different topic. 
---
For now you are right on both regards.
---
also what i am thinking too, ty!
---
Reddit for entry please!  
---
Thanks for the generosity!

yes i think thats an outfit, i can see it in my Hero&gt;outfit panel, all locked tho TT

The link just has the download?  Is there a description/documentation anywhere, or is it all in the rare file?  
---
Sorry, only as jigsaw puzzle... I'll see myself out now.
---
IllusoryDream.7648 :)
---
Oh, so you weren't around when we got people fired? Good times!
---
It's pretty simple reasoning, actually. If you compare GW1 and GW2, the engines are miles apart -- the GW1 engine lacks a true Z-axis (you can't jump) and it's heavily constrained. Graphically, it's old.
---
GW2 on the other hand, has a Z-axis and graphically looks just fine -- some of the older areas look a bit dated, but newer zones look great, which means the engine is still working just fine. Therefore, extremely unlikely to start work on a new engine.
---
Awesome! Ill use my reddit name since im on mobile and dont have the time to check the numbers.
---
And yet GW2 has plenty of good levels and plenty of not good players. Good level design doesn't always create masters, and when there are so many variables to design for it's easy for certain classes or players to just brute force mechanics or be carried by a zerg or that one really good player. 
---
Hmm good to know. I will have to look into purchasing the older LW episodes. Does ascended gear from previous seasons give the same stats as ascended gear from new seasons?
---
Even if you don't get ascended, Exotic gear is a minor stat loss and good for almost anything. Ascended is only really needed for high level Fractals because of a mechanic called agony. Basically, just hoard exotics. Hell, if you want, exotic armor is REALLY cheap on the trading post. Look up the stat you want (i.e. "Berserker") and you'll typically find a whole set only sets you back like a few gold (i.e. a couple days worth of dailies). Some sets like condition damage sets can be harder to acquire, but for those there's cheap substandard stat sets like carrion or dire or sinister. Gear is incredibly cheap even without trying to get it.
---
On the ascended front, one of the best ways of getting that, IMO, is through PvP. Every season, you can earn the Marks it takes to make one armor piece (depending on what you want to get). Outside of that, KyuubiJRR gave you some more sources. IMO, I would focus more on getting some generic exotic gear and seeing how you like the classes more before committing to ascended for any of them. Take some into lower level fractals and see how you do. Check Metabattle for some good builds and see if any jive with your playstyle for the class.
---
Guilds are overall such a waste in GUILD Wars, it's ridiculous. And one of the main reasons they're a waste is because they're so hard to find good ones or ones that fit what you're actually looking for.
---
Interesting that you claim to know better despite giving no reason why you should know better.
---
And even then, you admit that there are lots of interference from executives, so why the hostile tone? Are you incapable of admitting that someone else has a point? Instead you try to twist what I say, claim I have no experience and attempt to present my opinion as moronic, because I state that ethics in business are important.
---
And they are, because greed as the basic moral framework of an economy is inherently unhealthy. Which is why even the classical liberals admitted that wealth is not an end in and of itself, but a means to an end and that the pursuit of profit must be restrained by the framework of christian morality, otherwise the liberal ideas become hollowed out and replaced by a more tyrannical framework.
---
It even reached the attention of lawmakers, leading to the Belgian prohibition of lootboxes and here you are claiming that everything is fine, claiming that everyone who takes issue with the way the industry moved towards ever higher degrees of monetization is just naive. You claim that I'm a moral busibody for pointing out that the mobile industry in its early growth phase will have a lot of shady businesses trying to make a quick buck? 
---
But when I point out that people with no prior experience in gaming are more susceptible to cheap cash grabs, then I'm suddenly the evil elitist, who is excluding people to feel superior? Your assumptions are wrong as they are contradictory.
---
As I already said, mobile growth has gone down to 1% or lower for Zynga and other early mobile giants. Had No Man's Sky, which was considered a letdown on PC and Console been released as a mobile game, it would have had a much warmer reception.
---
Silverwastes is open to all gw2 players, including f2p.  
---
It's a great place to test-drive insta-boost level 80s before you lock them in.
---
It offers an introduction to a fully functioning map meta to new players.  It's a great place to tell f2p that there is much better content after they purchase.
---
I actually like this idea. Having an increase in social options and having social groups would be a boon to the game.
---
i'd like a breakthrough that she's reluctant to share because it requires an insanely unlikely epic quest to do.
---
and then Dragon Watch goes on that quest.
---
we will save Taimi!
---
Thank you I will have to change my mindset when it comes to how to play this game, im used to having a main single class I log in regularly to do everything on. 
---
Bloodstone Fen showed the effect uncontrolled magic overload can have. On the other hand in the base game we have the flamelegion trying and almost succeeding in creating a state closer to the gods.

Complete game shut down.

Go for it! A total blast and the whole game is very Noob friendly! Let's go :)

I remember outlining a potential [Guild Browser system](https://forum-en.gw2archive.eu/forum/game/gw2/Raids-highlight-the-need-of-a-Guild-Browser) 3 years ago on the official forums; didn't get any positive traction.
---
I wonder if anything changed in this time.

True, but I think if I go buy it in USD, my bank will hit me with a ridiculously bad exchange rate and fees. Still, I shall have a look around the internet to see what I can find in GBP.

What a great source.

welp, figured as much.. well I'm trying to get it done tonight, since apparantly there is a run planned!

Here's an upvote for you, kind sir.

Badeky.2518
---
It lacks workable water though. Having only 1 water level per map is really limiting imo unless they fix it soon.  
---
Also, underwater skills lack the 'punch' factor because the camera does not showcase them well.  
---
This also means that in the event we have aerial battles, this camera will also suck unless they fix it

Reminds of me of Karl Pilkington with hair... and breasts.

I'm sure that they will see this, take it seriously and change the game because of it. You're a hero.

guild alliances can now make an alliance ship that can also travel between tyria and mists FKA WvW, basically we fortnite now but with story progression that actually includes us and isnt just us watching some gimmicky live server event
---
Good level design doesn't always create good players, but being able to res-rush anything in the story is just embarrassing.
---
I'm not saying everyone in gw2 should have raid-level dps and rotations.  But is this community *seriously* telling me that a cleric shaman hybrid without runes or trinkets should seriously be able to defeat the final boss?

Then the same way she did before the gods left. I don't see how them leaving would affect anything.

Thanks a lot for doing this!

Thanks!!

it's still technically f2p. a game such as ESO where both the base game and the expansions are only available through purchase would be classified as b2p. swtor is f2p yet you have to buy the expansions or purchase a sub to be able to play them.
---
They do not, because no one at Anet has said anything remotely like this.
---
I expect 90% of all resources will still be going into the living world, with the rest of the game getting small updates.

The only announcement for 2019 are living world season 5.

So are WoW/FFXIV are also "technically f2p" where you can play the game upto a certain point before buying expacs and/or sub?

Not really fond of the idea of her becoming 100% gollem.

---
I would agree if not for the harsh CC phase midway through the meta that fails with most random groups and can even fail in organized ones. It is overblown compared to the rest of the event and further reason why people dislike the meta.
---
I agree that art is a celebration of that. But so are screenshots of your characters look. I dont see why the person I replied to is okay with art but not screenshots.

I would love one of those, thanks for your giveaway!

IIRC devs did tweaked mounts dismount "attack" but that's still not enough - those guys are definitely destroying the experience, especially for people who just joined GW2. 
---
Would like to I join? Use my reddit name it's fine.
---
I don’t think Aurene is dead. There is something about the dragon talk that happened in the trials.
---
My guess would be she need to be branded for her to ascend. And I think the only reason we were not told is because we would not agree to it.
---
It’s interesting how the story ended, seem very “Infinity war like” 
---
Get your weapons and armour slotted. This is a huge part of your damage. Get superior scholar runes for armour and superior force + impact sigil for weapons
---
Some people even tried porting [UI into WoW](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info23982-GW2UI.html#)
---
You know what they say, if you can take the dick, you can take the joke ;)
---
Take off your tin foil hat. There's a complaint post every month that gets a decent amount of upvotes about this as well. Mods are trying to compromise with the community not censor.
---
Possible but not profitable. This is not Anet’s fault. 
---
You don’t get the same revenue bump by update an old game then you do for a new release. 
---
2029 is when the next expansion comes out
---
You probably hear it a lot.
---
I'd like to add a commentary on development. I've been a professional software developer for the past 4-5 years working on a variety of different stacks and backend systems, but not a game developer by any means (I do as a hobby minorly), so take what I'm about to say with a grain salt.
---
I believe it is totally plausible for Gw2 to be around. Code bases, no matter how old, get cluttered and buggy as different and new hands touch it and initiatives to make major overhauls/rewrites can happen (I see a lot of talk on DX9) But most companies make the system modular enough to handle the clutter. I've seen systems built in early 2000s still being updated regularly. I have even participated in overhauling legacy systems to completely newer framesworks (i.e. .NET, Java, etc) 
---
In regards to the engine, I'm not experienced enough on gaming code standards to know the extent of upgrading. But I'm sure a company with knowledgeable developers would put a decent amount modularity and abstraction into how the system is created to be able upgrade different sections at different times and possibly be able to push a full upgrade if needed.
---
So, I think if GW2 isn't around in 10 years it won't be a software issue, as much as a company direction choice. A business choice essentially. And if the software isn't up to par, it might be because of a company choice not to spend money on an upgrade, because that doesn't yield profit like a content update would. 
---
tldr: software can be managed. Gw2 life depends on the company direction
---
Sure!  I'll enter with my Reddit name.  Thank you for running an event like this! &lt;3 generosity is an admirable trait
---
That Guy.5704
---
Well. You can still do that, you just have to seperate the character you play in the story and the one you are in the open world...
---
Probably hinting that we will know that Aurene isn't dead dead through Caithe and her connection to Aurene's spirit in the Mists.
---
Yeah, honestly, I've been playing since Heart of Thorns came out and I still have not bothered to get scholar runes. I think I use berserker runes or something? They were the second-best runes back before the rune overhaul. Now I think there's things like orge runes or something else that's considered second best. If you get login rewards daily, you'll pretty quickly accumulate black lion salvage kits. Just use those on most exotic gear with runes and you'll get nice ones after a while. Vampirism is considered a good "noob" rune because it makes you really hard to kill and stil buffs your flat damage.
---
Didn't ANet try to take away the Commanders "shine" in Heart of Thorns and the community for super angry?
---
Trahearne was the "main guy" during HoT campaign and I recall vividly this sub and the main forums being pissed off because of it. Which is why I think Trahearne (#s "died at the end of HoT").

I'd like to sign up with my Reddit name, please. But this is the first time I heard of the orchestra weapons lol.

I agree. After the event of living world season 2 you gain such a disdain for her and it never heals. It made also reasoning as to why the call of the egg to her as well. It made me feel for her again and be like I FORGIVE YOU!!!! I hope they do come back to the event and show the love to her. 
---
If what you want is an outfit, it will be gemstore only. and gemstore items are on a rotation so it may not even be available right now if you did want to buy it. 
---
Your two examples from FFXIV are literally like playing with a bearbow ranger or earth only elementalist while doing any relevant instance docntent. Shitters like those are in all games and the solution is the same for instanced content, you either carry them or you kick them from the group because duty finder isn't the place for RP.
---
[Yes.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Herald)
---
That Rev used his elite skill in glint stance. It hits hard if you don't dodge. 
---
I think that is something they have pushed into the open world. You can consider yourself in the open world to be this sort of adventurer seeing the sights and helping people where you can. That said, after this latest episode, perhaps we're headed to a soft "reset" of the character back to more humble, soul-searching stories. I'm not really confident in this, but it's possible.
---
I think it fell off the table couple of years after release.
---
Just a charr with large wings. The stances a revenant uses do not change your looks
---
fuckin' dan..
---
I'm the opposite to you you, I much prefer FFXIV to GW2 but I don't hate GW2. Its just side game I play while I wait for 5.0
---
The only thing I want is a small team dedicated to fixing all the little bugs and tune up the old content. Changing ID's of duplicate items and cleaning up the databases. 
---
[You mean this?]. It's the consume skill of the [Herald Elite skill](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Facet_of_Chaos).
---
I think when a single person does it, it's annoying but you can still engage with other groups that spawn before that sole Mount user is able to come and wipe the spawn out. It's when 3 or so are all seemingly competing to take out groups before the others that it becomes a huge hindrance for other players to get credit.
---
The biggest thing is these people that use mount can get a group wipe, and then move on. I don't get why they stick around. I know with PoF maps and onward that you have to stick around to get credit, but in Central Tyria that isn't the case. They can Mount, Dismount-Attack, re-Mount and be on the move again, just fine.
---
But again, I don't attribute it to malice. I think people just simply blank on their impact on other players when they do that.
---
i never said full diviner, i said diviner rifle with concentration sigil(and concentration food i guess) and the rest berserker
---
yes you can slot in bombs or grenades instead of rocket boots or swap between kits depending on the situation: chak gerent - take dps skills and modified ammunition free 26% modifier, pala/gh - take flamethrower juggernaut for tagging
---
changing skills and traits is free and doesn't take inventory space..there is no reason to have such an extensively dedicated set for farming especially since it gimps you in a lot of scenarios

no, farmers gonna farm no matter what. esp. mithril

Thx for your generousity!

Hope you realise how your comment is just cementing the fact of how toxic you come out as.

I really hope you find purpose other than being angry over virtual items on videogame, where the items have pretty much shit-all use anyway. Calling people stupid for disagreeing with you is what's wrong with current political- and discussion-climate. I'm done with that. 
---
Im a a same config and i cant tell you that there is not a lot of place where i can go to 144 fps
---
we got same ram, i got better GPU 1080 but 6700K cpu.
---
I know it does not feel right at the begining but you get use to it, its not PC its just the way the game is design with and old engine.  
---
The only thing that will truly affect you fps in large population aera are charachter model Limit and character model quality.
---
Even with those spec i need to turn both to lowest in Large event meta or in WvW bus cause it's too laggy without this

Could have been Herald elite Facet's consume skill: Elemental Blast

Ain't that the truth, I'm still trying to find a guild that's around my age (25)
---
Yeah we lost Eir as well, She was a better character than Braham but he is okay as the team's Norn. Cannach on the other hand, why not just give us Aerin as the team's Sylvari? Seriously though there were the pact Sylvari members who help you during the original Zaitan quest. But no, we need to get Anise's prisoner. Heck, a Choya would be better as the team's plant. I'd take "Grimble grimble" instead of that annoying whistling any day.
---
Just hoping they don't end up replacing Taimi with an inquest guy. What's next? we get a Son of Svanir to replace Braham? Flame legion members replace Rox and Rytlock? Kasmeer gets replaced by an ascalon ghost? 
---
I thought it was like they were praying to gods to grant them their powers. If there are no gods, then no one can answer prayers.

Never forget when I commissioned art from someone of my mom's character for mothers day and a bunch of people thought it was "critique" to tell me to find another artist. People here think they can get away with being jerks under the guise of "well its constructive criticism." I went to art school. I know when criticism is constructive.

&gt; Arenanet is also looking for mobile developers, so maybe some new GW title for mobile? 
---
If it complements the main game sure, like getting more materials or change your look on your phone and it'll update in game (limited by charges of course but won't be taken until you load the game after the last update.)
---
If you have the expansions, at level 80 you start working on your Masteries.  The core game has the least amount, but HoT's gives you a glider, and PoF gives you mounts.  I would strongly suggest you start with PoF.  It makes everything else easier, especially trying to navigate the jungle maps in HoTs.
---
I think Silverwastes is intended to be that repeating farm, though. I think that's why people were kind of upset that Istan existed, because it added a better looping farm than the previous one and felt like power creep in that people who don't own Istan can't farm that map. Having a dedicated farming map isn't a problem, it's having more farming maps that all "have to" out-do each other.
---
Well the story, it goes on. You want to prep for it (recommended), gear up, spec your build, get used to it, etc. Get full exotic (via any of the available options). Go on with the story, gather hero points and masteries, "quests" are still there (hope you did not spend time on every single one) - this is where you might wanna to complete the core world maps as well.
---
Lots of stuff to do, still: World bosses, dungeons, fractals, raids, and Living world season episodes, side stories, achievement-quests, just achievements, alts.
---
PvP, WvW.
---
It impacts the quality of the game when it becomes standard.
---
Compare the pathetic state of the personal story to any mission from gw1 and it becomes instantly obvious one of them is a scripted mess and the other is a game.
---
RIP Istan, you will be missed.
---
Axem.9283
---
I hope you do more of these, cause *hot damn*
---
Unfortunately no. :( 
---
[So you want to be the side kick in your own fantasy?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOoUteabhgc)
---
I haven’t gotten any mounts yet.   I’m still unsure how to start either PoF or HoT. 
---
Not at home at the minute so I'll submit my Reddit name.
---
Orchestral Greatsword, I pray for thee.
---
Huh, already a new festival again.
---
I'd love to sign up with my reddit name :)
---
Ok, I’ll check that.  Should I start with HoT or PoF?
---

---
Can confirm, I was not happy momma tree made me go find an impressive sword then give it to my brother. No tears were shed at the end of HoT but I definitely hate him less.

I'd like to enter!

Festival Wars 2.
---
Aurene sems to be dead now, half disappointed but half what I was expecting. Kralkatorik is an elder dragon. Zaitan was the final boss of the main story, Mordremoth was in HoT. the death on an Elder Dragon hardly seems like something that will happen in a Living World episode. That seems to be for more minor villains like Caudicus and Joko.
---
Here I was thinking they would fix the chasing tales achievement bugs.
---
*Laughs in profession balance*
---
&gt; Alacrity: Fixed a bug that removed this boon from players in a downed state.  
---
Finally
---
Need to get my hands on a Glyph of the Tailor and Glyph of the Leatherworker tbh
---
Levi.8495
---
It sure crept on us o . o
---
I can assure you that no one person is the reason for this.
---
This has been something that has been getting branstormed pretty much since October when we had to make a megathread because of 10+ cosplay posts an hour and any selfposts were just instantly buried. Combined with that a few posts where members have flat out asked people to use the other subs for their posts and we the mods have gotten dozens of messages asking us to do something and art/screenshot posts getting enough reports for automod to remove them.
---
This was what we came up with in the idea to satisfy both sides. Very obviously that has not been the case and we realize now that while we had good intentions this system is not going to work as well as we thought. I'm hoping to get another announcement out some point today explaining our stance going forward as well as dealing with another issue.
---
2(3) new great swords and a mount with the next LS update.
---
Sure I'd like to get in :3 you can use my reddit name 
---
Chronologically, HoT. Content wise, it depends on what you want. If you want mounts, PoF.
---
Was hoping the same, I am still stuck on focus and rifle.....
---
I'll enter!
---
Atelia.4852
---
I love that these are being placed in the chests. It makes them drop in price so much. I was able to get my Advanced home racks for a steal since they were in the chests. 
---
\&gt; No Revenant changes
---
Oh.. okay... :(
---
Many bug fixes aren't listed in the patch notes.
---
Look at your Hero's Journal.  You should see a quest pertaining to Path of Fire.  You should be able to activate it from there.
---
I am sorry but the only think I know about your "raid skills" (as if thats something to be proud about in a casual MMRPG game with very casual raids like this) is that you guys like to sell raid spots for money instead of, you know, try to teach new players how to raid/improve/became better.
---
At least in EU, trust me, we are not gonna miss you at all.
---
listen to yourself. you can experience the entire base game that used to be B2P for free now. WoW up to 20 is a free trial, i don't know about FFXIV as i havent played it but if its the same thing as wow then its a free trial. the entire base game of gw2 is *not* a free trial, its the base game. by your logic every f2p game with an expansion is b2p, which is ridiculous. 
---
Agreed, now to farm some gold up and get them!
---
As I never played GW1 I cannot do that. Also I think the personal story is fine even if it doesn't completely meet its full potential. 
---
Its too perfect now it doesn't need much changed
---
farmers can play bdo. its guild wars 2.
---
That's true I didn't think of that. Well maybe just cut the VM drops from chests at half?
---
That's probably something on your end, I haven't heard complaints from anyone in my guild about lag or ping issues
---
Oh that's nice :) 
---
I'll sign up with my redditname :)
---
&gt;From my experience in both, I am indeed saying that, on average, art requires a lot, a lot more time, thought and effort than taking pictures.
---
This is just your experience though. There are photographers that travel the world, war zones, disasters just to take a shot at a moment. You can draw a lion in the wild from your home, you won't be able to make this as a photographer. You can draw a solar eclipse whenever you want, you won't be able to do the same as a photographer. Depending on the definition of effort, this will simply differ from person to person.
---
 A real photographer, who is also be an artist, shows us a different world-view -his/her artistic view- through a lens. Comparing your personal photo experience to "art" is simply like a professional photographer saying "eh I can draw something in 5 minutes but to take this storm photo, I had to prepare for months and travel kilometers to find the vision that I have"
---
Also talking about spending time on "photos" and "art" like they are two different things belongs to 1850-1900 time period really. Photography, in the modern world, is accepted as a form of art. 
---
Welp, this is end of my off-topic comment.
---
I’ll sign up with my Reddit name, thank you!
---
Why they never include also the end date of the festival.. Like, please Anet
---
If you can't get the basics of your rotations in less than an hour then i have bad news for you.
---
Can somebody explain this event?
---
Kinda new-ish player
---
I love the 2 bickering Dredge ghosts in the Dwarf tombs
---
If you start with HoT and you are, as you said, new... prepare to die. A lot.
---
use my reddit name :)
---
Gelvsta.1930 o/
---
Beggining of season.... No balance...
---
Will do.  Thanks!
---
I barely if ever die with my base engineer( can't be arsed to collect 250 hero points and I'm keeping the WvW ones for my chrono). All you have to do is run behind the columns in gh and when the champions that spin you come in pala you need to double dodge while looking outwards - you shouldn't need to be at melee range so this should be enough to get you out. If you see you can't get out just throw some cc to help and have one roll ready for when the aoe hits - you can dodge it.
---
Guild Wars 2's version of Chinese New Year that takes place in Divinity's Reach. There's unique items themed to the animal represented in this year's Chinese New Year (in this case, boar/pig). There was a race added last year, and there's a unique PvP mode as well (kind of a deathmatch oriented mode that relies on you picking up skills from orbs on the map). 
---
There's not really a big farm like Halloween, but it's a good source of magic find buffs, good replacement combat food and general messing-around activities.
---
The game finally begins.
---
Use my reddit name please, thanks!
---
&gt; 100% certain there will be no gw3 until they're done with the elder dragons.
---
Inb4 Anet drops GW2 and continues the dragon story in a bran new game called GW:Immortal coming to everyone's new favorite device :&gt;
---
I'll enter with my reddit name. :)
---
Stack magic find items to open envelopes for vendor loot. Play games like Dragon Ball to get more envelopes. Jump around DR to get achievements. It's a fairly minor holiday, so don't stress it too much.
---
Personal story is NOT fine.
---
It's designed like a 2010 military shooter.
---
http://i.imgur.com/BITmX.jpg
---
hear what
---
Didnt Aurene eat Palawa Joko? So shouldnt she absorb some of his power, aka his ability to revive?
---
Aurene coming to the Domain of the Lost is a new and interesting idea that I have not pondered so far. 
---
Still, I think all signs do point to Aurene's eventual revival, whether or not we go to the DotL again.
---
There is the talk about Ascension having aspects that only Dragons can express to each other and the fact that Aurene defeated a doppelganger of herself. She also has a slightly changed form this episode.
---
There is the fact that Aurene foresaw this future and we went ahead with it anyway (which seems incredibly stupid from us /AND/ Glint if it turns out that she never /had/ to die.)
---
There is the fact that she absorbed the Lich magic of Palawa Joko, the Undying. 
---
And then there is another, final fact: That Ogden Stonehealer and the Priory had knowledge of another prophecy for who-knows-how-long, said prophecy involving the aforementioned death of a Lich.
---
 
---
We don't question Ogden much about this new prophecy, which is not part of the Flameseeker Prophecies. He simples shoves us into Glint's Lair and later explains nothing at Thunderhead, which to me is an outrage, but they didn't slap that blabber about three signs in there for no reason. Ogden ows us an explanation, and we might actually get that next episode. 
---
Anyone have the notes copy/paste since the bot is being lazy?
---
Where is the purple room fix and the QoL that was announced related to that stuff?
---
it's still not fixed?!
---
I think it will have content on the front page, the problem is that the front page was at time over 50% art / screenshots which was blocking other posts from reaching the front page. It's not the art itself that is the problem, it's the quantity of it. I can appreciate good art, however when it fills the front page almost entirely, which it has done on multiple occasions, then it gets really tiring to see and the sub starts to lose its appeal. Whatever the outcome of this experiment in regards to art, I think screenshots should be limited to a certain day or a megathread, permanently. 
---
Hope im not late. Use my reddit name please. 
---
Thanks for doing this!
---
Meech.9362
---
As someone who has only been playing for a couple of months it's great to a community like this
---
No words on the purple plate bug or did i miss it?
---
Looks like they broke Launch Buddy again!  Just white screen(s) when you try to login
---
volcity.9780
---
Just rolled a bard Mesmer yesterday, and began the grind to get some of these weapons, they are pretty cool!
---
This is such a stupid rule and will make the sub look dead and less colorful. There was never a problem with this, how many people were complaining vs the amount of people in this sub?
---
~~Chinese~~ Canthan New Year: set off fireworks, open Envelopes, do Team PvP in an underground area, and so on. Usually a couple Back skins and some Guild decorations, as well as AP to farm. 
---
It's not f2p because it comes with similar restrictions like all trials do like chat,  TO and understandably so because otherwise bots will wreck the game. Buying an expansion lifts these restrictions which the core game players never had to experience because they bought it in the first place. 
---

---
&gt; Our goal is for content like the Istan Metas to be a part of your daily play-cycle, without it becoming your entire play-cycle. In the next content build, we will be making some adjustments to the chests associated with the Palawadan and Mordant Crescent Great Hall metas in the Domain of Istan. An account daily limit will be applied to these chests, allowing for the opening of a maximum of 30 chests in Palawadan and 12 chests in the Great Hall per day per account. The base gear rewards have been increased, as well, so players playing through each meta once will see an increase to their rewards, but repeated runs will be less lucrative.

[ posted on ](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/66526):
---
No Istan changes?
---
is there anything to get hyped for if i don't care about living story or pve maps?
---
Wasn't that the time of a very general content drought? Aetherpath was added at the end of 2013 and I remember quite a veritable exodus in the first half of 2014 (myself included, thanks to Wildstar).
---
try updating the client first
---
*shrugs* I'm okay with that. One of my favorite games of all time came out in 2010 and it was a lot like that.
---
I play way more FF than GW2 because I love raiding and raids in GW2 were OK but not as good as the ones in FF in my opinion (partly beacuse I prefer FF's gameplay), but my point was that if I want to play "casually" (brackets on casually, beacause I'm the kind of idiot that will optimise DPS on every single occasion\^\^) or in a relaxed way, I'll go on GW2 because I'll have things to do that don't involve the huge russian roulette that is finding teammates in a MMO.
---
An other way to say it is that I don't need proper teammates to work on my legendary weapons or to do HoT's meta event (which I still love despite doing them hundreds of time) in GW2. While if I want to farm seiryu ex or these \[insert worst insult known here\] primals of the BLU skills I'll need a pt of potencial idiots
---
I don't understand what you mean by "increasing competition" among artists; artists post on this subreddit because it is their passion, not for business purposes. Thank you for your concerns, though. Like we said, this is just an experiment and we will see how it goes.
---
What else is new?
---
But we will have to download the NCSoft Games store first
---
The core story has different achievements for the different races and paths but after you choose an order to join it's all the same.
---
Heart of Thorns story has some unique interactions when you play through as a Sylvari, but that's the only time it's different.
---
Path of Fire, IIRC, doesn't really have any unique interactions.  Maybe if you're a human that chose Balthazar at character creation.
---
In short, there are some achieves for different races and choices...but otherwise the story all goes to the same place so it's not really necessary to go through the story multiple times if you don't want to.
---
By chance do you have other resolutions?
---
I mean.../r/guildrecruitment does okay with its assigned task...
---
While outlawing art posts might indeed stifle some posters, I'd think a consistent push toward /r/guildwarsdyejob for screencaps could very well increase its activity level, combined with a steady pressure against those types of posts in this sub.
---
Not saying you're wrong or expressing any fundamental agreement or disagreement with your overall point, just indicating that we do have a precedent for "disallow here, push to another sub" working.
---
I did, client works fine but every instance opened through Launch Buddy is a white screen
---

Amazeballs
---
Anet do pvp maps every few months, but the other thing they said was that "expansion level content" would be released.
---
This *theoretically* could mean more elite specs, practically that is increeedibly unlikely.
---
just as healthy curiosity... can anybody paste the text from the creation screen about the classes? It is supposed to be more detailed and stuff
---
Reddit name! I’ll be honest, I’m quite new and had to look up what these even were. 
---
Funerary
---
You do realize that quickly a problem will happen unless they rework how fractals and fractal tiers work :
---
once we have more than 25 fractals, you'll end up either needing to expand the size of "tiers" to accomodate for more fractals, or end up with some fractals that won't ever be in some tiers, and if that means they aren't in T4 they will seldom be played (ie : only by people grinding their way to T4 for rewards).
---
So back to the starting point. :D
---
On top of that, there is as much or more work involved in converting an old dungeon path to a fractal honestly, just because everything is so outdated and spagghetti code.....
---
They changed Drooburt's achievement to gobble luck instead of dumplings
---
Was waiting on your post, thank you dulfy!
---
Pigs cute but if only it unlocked a version without it too. 
---
crashing when previewing the new exalted shoulders..
---
Ya ok fine, you win Anet.
---
I'm making a piggy outfit with that staff, I get it.
---
Admiralnerf.1853
---
if the definition of f2p was a game without restrictions, you would be correct, but that is not the definition. f2p is a game that is free to play. you are mistakenly believing that because a small amount of features are restricted on f2p accounts that the base game is not f2p, when in actual fact it is. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-play
---
I’d like to enter with my Reddit name, thanks!
---
I don't think Deadeye should have been as high as it was. Benchmarking around 33-34k seems reasonable however Daredevil now has the higher single target damage, more survivability, more cleave, more vulnerability, more CC and Stolen Skills.
---
That seems a touch off from a balance perspective. Would be fine if Daredevil was closer to 32-33k.
---
Pistolwhip.2697
---
 Did you try Renegade? Group boon application is similar to banner slave but more active. Some decent area healing and alacrity is just too good to pass up. Although dps wise, it takes a bit longer to kill stuff because of its wind-up time.
---
I would start with HoT if it's your first time through the story...if you don't have LWS2 that is.  If you have LWS2 start with that first as that's chronologically the next playable story step.  
---
If you don't have S2 to play, then watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d17gwV4vXOg) and read up on Season 2 first to catch up on the story before HoT begins or else you'll be scratching your head at every turn going "what is going on?!?!?!  who are these people?!?!?!?!"
---
Damn, those shoulders are extra AF. I need them.
---
 Don't you guys have phones?!!?!??!!!?? -Susan
---
oh look slippery is in 100cm again thanks anet!
---
no fixes to the buggy mess with the colored plates or the new weapon collections not registering kills either
---
10/10
---
I believe they standardized it to all festivals lasting 3 weeks, meaning it will end Feb 11.
---
the first thing people should look at is that there was no explosion of Magic when aurene died, but if she would have died her magic would have been set free

"Random  drop from BLC". Okay, Anet. Time to stop adding awesome armor stuff on the chest. 
---
I'm generally in the same boat.
---
I'm annoyed by the shitposts...and very subjectively, I didn't inherit the "art appreciation" gene, so honestly, the drawings, screens either poorly or well done, and even the raptor sculpture all fail to move me in any way.
---
I would also go a step further and cast doubt on the notion that upvotes = it must be okay. People will upvote anything, and it takes a special negative reaction to get a downvote from most people (myself included), so the end result is a slow race to the bottom for overall quality. As people slowly start to look at a site (or sub) as less of a discussion forum and more of a memedump, it's easier to ignore and leave vs reporting, downvoting, and complaining. This leaves you with less of those types making a stronger and stronger majority of the type that make or upvote low quality posts, giving the impression that the community is liking that tripe more and more.
---
It is not launchbuddy itself, I have a self writen login programm with the same issue
---
Insta bought the staff. its so cute :D
---
you can use my reddit name :D
---
i feel like the cost of the World Boss Portal device will take years to pay off, even counting the rewards from doing every worldboss once a day. 
---
Kingdom of Loathng has had what you're describing for over ten years. It's not as if ESO invented it
---
Maybe what you saw was a Dragon Finisher?
---
Oh no that staff is too cute!
---
As is tradition. One new item per patch will crash the client you just have to find out which one.

Hey there, thanks for contributing the community! Please include my reddit name aswell!

Make dragonhunter longbow good pls
---
I like to imagine our character going into a downward spiral. We lost Aurene, Taimi's not doing too well, Caithe is more than likely suffering the worst of it all, and we, ourselves, still have a dragon out there, but what Kralk's next move is yet to be known.
---
We're going to feel some sense of isolation. We might doubt ourselves in being able to help anyone or anything after that fiasco. Eventually, we'll find something to do on our own, which could eventually lead into the one last spark of a chance to set things right.
---
Gw1 vets likely make up a small minority of total gw2 players, the engine can always be upgraded its all a matter of Cost Benefit Analysis. Though hey shout-outs for remembering us Gw1 players Luxons4Life. 
---
Most sane companies don't make 2 MMOs let alone 3 all of the same IP. You already compete with others, then you end up competing with yourself they all have high upkeep costs rather than fire and forget/collect profit. 
---
I don't really want to see excuses from companies especially when Warframe which is as old, has constantly improved immensely over the years instead of revel in its laurels of the past. A guild-wars 3 if we did get one, would likely be a Witcher style large single player game or 4 player Co-Op not an MMO. All in all, there's no reason they cant keep Gw2 like WoW and just improve it, assuming there's enough payers. 
---
Same here.
---
I'd like to think in these days of high player turnovers, we as the community need to foster more inclusivity instead of barring new members with "skill tests". From what I understand, hardcore guilds hold themselves in high standards and that once their regular members flake out due to real life responsibility, it's difficult to recruit new blood.
---
What's about giving people opportunities to try out and offer necessary trainings to pass their skill tests? And quit it with personal vendetta against individuals because a few important people "doesn't like that recruit".
---
In the end of the days, it's up to their management to run their guild as a private company or a public organization. If it leads to their own demise because they can't be arse to play with anyone else then I'm indifferent. Ironically, I'm friends with a few real nice DnT members and they're kinda out of the loops with the big announcement their leaders want to make. Never seen a guild segregates this badly.

Year of the Boar, finally. 
---
I was being sarcastic D: 
---
Looks like it.
---
I am normally a lurker on this sub, but I just gotta say this is sad. I mean, does it have something to do with Guild Wars 2? Yes. These are people who obviously love the game and have made content about it. Why limit that?
---
Hope I'm not too late! Signing up with Reddit name as well. :)
---
Where did you see Shrine outfit?
---
wait... is this a new achievement? so i missed 50 ap last year and there is no Chance to get them?
---
1. You can sell luck??
---
2. How the fuck do you have all that realistate for luck?
---
3. ONLY 1k gold?
---
One thing that seems to help with that is the GW2 handles the cursor movement. I only realized this recently. For example even if my FPS tanks to single digits in GW2 the cursor movement is still smooth as it usually it but in Monster Hunter World my cursor movement slows down with my FPS making the responsiveness feel laggy. I had the same issue in Grim Dawn but I couldn't put my finger on what the problem was at the time.
---
I would like to enter with my reddit account. 
---
Would like to enter with my Reddit name. Thanks so much for the giveaway!
---
I decided to commission a piece of art featuring my friends' characters and mine in a real world scenario that we love.
---
It came out so well and we decided to share it here!
---
It's really nice in between LW episodes. More things to do and play around with. 
---
I mean.. you need to sell it to him.. 1 click per essence, no?
---
Thats not luck sink.. thats ANet idea of a JOKE!
---
Seems like -nopatchui command like doesn't work anymore after update. Also there is no way anymore to run multiple accounts on same machine. Can someone confirm same?
---
data mining
---
I would love to enter this awesome giveaway :)
---
Damn, the shoulder piece looks really good. Too bad that it's from BLTC chests.
---
&gt; Ogden ows us an explanation, and we might actually get that next episode.
---
I do believe the [Tome of the Rubicon](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tome_of_the_Rubicon), that basically described the awakening of Primordius and the dwarfs transformed into stone, has some elements that could explain why Ogden sent us to Thunderhead.
---
Apart from the Prophecies of the Seeker of the Flame, that's the only other prophecy tha tI can remember of, and which might contains things that we haven't heared of before (but dwarves may have).
---
Are you checking in LFG? Most days there will be some people trying to attempt it at some point, but if you're just going to a map and waiting, you may not end up in one of those instances.
---
same problem here
---
Thank you for saying that, I apparently failed at reading and just assumed that it would be for gems. Silly me. -_-
---
Tried to boot with lunchbuddy and had issues, came here to see if others are having the same problem... you and I make 2...
---
This is a new achievement. No, you didnt miss 50AP, unless you missed snowflake one.
---
actually i like the descriptions, very accurate!
---
I like seeing the art and stuff people come up with, including outfits, it's like the most interesting thing about the reddit for the game. Probably most of my time in this reddit is looking at art and outfits, because I like all that stuff. If I don't like something, downvote or skim past it, it doesn't bother me that much. If they remove the art only for a specific day, it's going to get boring in here.
---
If there's some issue I'm having with the game, I usually google it and find other people who've had it in official forums or reddit; or I use the search function here. I mean, it's not hard to find stuff I need if I use the search bar, google, or filter stuff. So, I personally don't get the issue about it.
---
Note that hero points in the expansions are worth 10 instead of 1. If you have trouble finding them the gw2 wiki database is a great place to start. Are you NA or EU? cause I have some free time today and could help you.
---
MadJope.6789 and thanks for doing this ^^
---
Yup, seems to be borked.
---
I'm sure of it. 
---
The animations, projectiles, and sound effects are pretty much identical between the 2 skills shown. ALl that footage is from beta (the video is from 13 months before launch, and probably recorded even earlier), so while it could've been two skills back then, it doesn't make sense for Anet to promote two skills that look so much the same.
---
Later on in the video, you also see the ele throw two Static Fields in quick succession, so I'm sure that they've just disabled cooldowns for convenience and flavour.
---
Best change in the whole patch for beetle/griffon lovers.
---
White screen mostly just means it is failing somewhere at the launcher part. Login issues, authentication problem, conn issues you name it. And since normal login works i guess they broke autologin again.
---
Ah yes, one of the most enjoyable parts about BDO. Along with literal days of grinding to get 1% of a level, and then have someone take your farming spot and remove the 1% you just achieved.
---
 JustACat.1086 
---
Or... they recognise that anet is a company and will need to keep making buck in the future. Gw2 is fine for now, but it isn't going to last forever.
---
Sign me up under my Reddit name, thanks!

The New Year's Benevolence achievement has been updated to allow contributions of any Lunar New Year food. Items can now be given to a quintet of celestial pigs that are hungry for different festival treats.
---
Probably not lost.
---
I mean, they didnt vanish, they just left.
---
Rune is what roaming guardians and DHs have been looking for for many many moons. Looks great.
---
Should shoot off fireworks when auto-attacking....
---
I get most of mine from salvaging items.
---
Almost certainly to do with future projects imo
---
Ya think we missed it. Friend I know who finished old one have new achievement too.
---
Kinda cute, but mostly irrelevant. 
---
Looks like a thing for a very specific solo high boon duration (diviner?) build that doesn't have access to swiftness, Whatever that could be. 
---
Just a fyi guys.  Drooburt takes one luck at a time.  So if you have a stack of exotic essences, it will take 500 clicks to give it to him... My hands are hurting just thinking about it :sadface: 
---
The game is centered on solo play and it is very difficult to fail the content. Massively single player game. Other players are like NPC running around that you can ignore if you want to. Which means, other players don't matter to your own success, thus it doesn't matter what they do, they won't affect you much. This makes most people more willing to be nice and etc. You feel good about helping others, and you aren't ever forced to do so. 
---
However the moment you do need people for your own success, the thing about being nice and etc breaks down pretty fast and there is where the PvP/WvW/Meta/Fractals/Raids gatekeeping/toxicity comes in. 
---
I’m not disagreeing with any of that, just don’t think it’s out of the question that they will do a sequel or another game in the world at some point 
---
Gw2 isn't a WoW level success though, it will start to fade a few years from now and tech keeps pushing forward.
---
Also, it runs poorly all things considered and is very limited by being pc only. 
---
Except for those who miss them and they are another 50AP behind...
---
On mobile but it says on the sheet
---
Sushi! It's cute, good job!!
---
Plus, they need stuff to market their expansions on!
---
Only from black lion salvage kits
---
Warframe is a very different game and is naturally easier to upgrade than gw2 is.
---
Exalted gloves, now shoulders. So, we getting Svanir shoulders next, and are we talking slow releases of entire armor sets at the price point of 360 statuettes? 
---
NA, but wont have time to play today or tomorrow, on storm duty as we got hit with a major ice storm here and have been working 12-16 hour shifts. 
---
I didnt know about the expansion hero points are worth 10. 
---
I’m new to events is there an event going on I don’t know about ????
---
Thanks a lot, this was more helpful than any video on youtube.  I will keep creating games of different variety and keep applying.  :)
---
Small personal guild halls... 
---
Such wasted potential.
---
Shit small medium sized guild halls... so we aren't just stuck with the huge ones.
---
Put one in every city even.
---
Can someone post an autohotkey script for this? XD Since they allow that stuff now. 
---
And my roaming power mirage who has a huge lack of swiftness and i hate quick swapping to focus.
---
I'm guessing it's "only" 1k gold compared to the space and time it took to get all of that.
---
It's not super hard to get 1k. If it's something you focus on, from having nothing to sell, you could probably get that much in under two weeks.
---
You waiting for a better deal to show up?
---
Yeah they're much harder to get tho, some are soloable but for most of them you need at least a team of two. 
---
Overlord Odin.3958
---
So make it up in other ways? I don't quite understand the issue you're proposing.
---
Seems like it has potential to become one of the biggest roaming runes.
---
the Lunar Festival is pretty tame compared to say, Wintersday. Nothing wrong with letting players have something else to goof around with between story updates
---
"accurate"
---
Most of the meta builds are the opposite of what the class favors. And GS Warrior just got nerfed again by a bugfix.
---
Well luckily for those people, AP isn't something you need.
---
You might be able to position the dialog box over droobert where you can auto click him, and click the option. Like placing the Accept button over the Tome of Knowledge when using them to level a toon. 
---
It shouldve been 250AP max, so people still have some chance to catch up even if missing the meta a year or 2.
---
Acc name: kumori.5734

I really do love the guild wars 2 community Ive seen sooo many giveaways over the past three years even though Ive never won anythings :( 
---
P.S. Thank You so much for doing this!
---
Some people play through "all" the content of a given LW episode in a matter of days. A couple weeks? Most "hardcore" gamers have moved on.
---
Plus, this festival is pretty light with events. It's just another round of dailies to complete, what's the issue in that? If someone were inclined, they could complete the event dailies and have plenty of time to head back to Thunderhead.
---
Like linkshells in FFXIV! :D
---
well.. im close to 38k AP.. and havent done the latest story.. so yeah.. im kinda competetive.. not that i would stand any chance.. i hate wvw.. and there are so many ap =D
---
Maybe a new  revenant wvw meta?
---
Lunar New Year just started today.

Sign me up please with my Reddit name

Thank you

Price spikes on TP before I can get home to stock up on mats...
---
The word "favors" I implies that a class is kost comfortable/does best with a specific weapon.
---
It does not matter what is available in the game, these classes favor the opposite currently.
---
The magic and power you get from consuming others seems to be so open for discussion that we have no idea what powers she absorbed. Definitely seems like a possibility, although not as cool as fighting in The Mists... maybe I'm projecting a little.
---
The time requirement to dump all of his luck 1-at-a-time wouldn't be worth it.  He'd be better off farming Istan.
---
oh, wait...
---
They've said that season 5 will have expansion-like content, so they might be trying to make the LW episodes bring new and innovative content and garner similar interest as expansions.
---
I'm not saying I think it's a good idea or that it will work, I'm just saying that it seems like they might have decided to go in this direction.
---
Aurene, Joko, Glint , etc. There is a path you are not seeing.
---
Anet is going to give us time, How?, with kralkatorrik going to sleep.
---
Kralk is hurt, so he will go to rest, maybe will come back to the mist and sleep, maybe he just gonna scape to a mountain, desert, sea and sleep. 
---
Now, we have time, The world doesn't need saving!!!, so that give us plenty of time to research, pray, think a way to deal with Aurene.
---
Meme reaper boon build.
---
*Casually waiting for Dulfy's comment on this post, so I can joke Dulfy x That_Shaman ship is confirmed.*
---
That is a welcome change.
---
In my first ever MMO, every race-class-combination had a nice bit of lore tied to selecting it. This is more practical than that, but it can be interpreted as to there being some interest in better tutorialization - which would be welcome. 
---
&gt; All the light armor classes have one melee weapon each,
---
Necro has 2 via reaper...
---
Yep, they nerfed it alright. Even less VM in the chests aswell . Rip Istan
---
Purity of purpose. 
---
Thanks for this awesome opportunity!! Use my reddit name ^-^

A giveaway would make me feel better while I'm ill.
---
&gt; **Versatile** Caster Elementalists harness the power of the four elements—water, earth, fire, and air—to cast **powerful spells**.
---
Nice one. Trait 1-2 attunements, but the rest are dog shit. Spend 2 second casting *powerful* skills so enemy can kill you easier.
---
well this is a first. People normally moan there **isn't** enough content!
---
Guys, revert your launch buddy to 1.7 and just press launch as many times as you need the clients while having auto-login unchecked.
---
Don't know why the Launch Buddy creator removed this function in 1.8 when ArenaNet has caused conflicts with the  -patchui before.
---
By the way, this workaround was suggested by the launch buddy creator, so it makes no sense he would remove this workaround in 1.8
---
\-\_-
---
What armor / Outfit is OP wearing here?
---
Somebody is reading too many ecchi/romance manga.
---
the game is technically f2p so you can totally just make a new account on NA and just do a couple of levels, see how you manage the ping
---
personally i get 150+ on NA(from EU) which isn't that bad but definitely annoying
---
Drop rates and time-gated drops are a *build* change rather than a *patch* change, if that makes sense. 
---
When they change the build, they change something on their servers and then they patch the game, they change something on our computers.
---
There is an announcement that it would be part of the new build, which is the one that is live now. 
---
Ele has 2 via weaver
---
For ele?
---
This is basically just a worse version of Rune of the Pack, isn't it? 
---
I’ll go check it out thank you :) 
---
Yeah and you get statues from keys+chest so, not really. 
---
I wasn't counting elite specs, because by the time a player has those, they'll know how weapon skills work and won't need that hint anymore. 
---
How does one get 1k in 2 weeks?
---
It still shouldn't say this at all, it's still implying rangers are a bow class when no game ever should say this.
---
Yeah no
---
Dungeons are doable on your journey to lvl 80, after that the real game starts.
---
Compared to other MMOs, in gw2 it does not take you long to get to 80, even when you start new.
---
Fractals are the "I'm getting into instanced pve now" gamemode :)
---
They (and raids) get new content regularly
---
I had one drop ages ago and it never even occurred to me to sell it... had I known I probably would have, but it's nice to get leather for mining sometimes. I got 3 for 3 today, which was neat.
---
I think "favors" here implies you have more choice for Range/Melee.
---
Warrior really only has Rifle and LB as range weapons bu has a ton of melee weapons --&gt; Favors Melee
---
Mesmer only really has 1 melee weapon (talking about core only here) the mainhand Sword but has a lot more range weapons --&gt; Favors Range
---
Not defending any side here tbh just pointing out what might be behind "favors".
---
That's probably it. I play in NA.
---
 Use my reddit name 
---
Don´t fractals scale you up to 80? 
---
That's not a good reason.  That's an excuse. 
---
same. im getting white screen.
---
first world problems have to now log in 4 times manually!
---
I am pretty sure they just decided against showing that, because it was not relevant to the plot at that time. Regarding Tequatl, this now is indeed a bit questinable, but Zhaitan could technically have exploded out of sight when he dropped from the tower, right? Do correct me if I'm wrong, it's been a while. 
---
Really strong rune, perfect for mesmer/guardian/power necro/renegade roamers who really need a passive movement speed rune that doesn't gimp your build.
---
I think that (6)bonus of: 6 stacks of might +fury + vigor for 6s in combat with 20s CD is a bit too much though.
---
&gt;It's easy to see why newer players might feel scared or overwhelmed by Fractals or Raids. 
---
Not even newer players. I have had GW2 since early access and have over 1k hours of play time. I've played on and off for years. I played in fractals when it was first added, but not in probably 4 years or so.
---
I've recently returned, after putting many more hours into FFXIV, where I was part of a dedicated raid static for several years.
---
I have quite intimidated by GW2's fractal and raid system, and I am not entirely sure why. I'm a raider, and experienced in GW2, but for some reason the stepping stone from open world to instanced content is too large.
---
Please no, I am already prepared: https://i.imgur.com/hWRTmEi.png
---
Do you know if the people that completed the previous Drooburt's achievement are able to complete this one as well?
---
That just allows to multibox but still need to enter login details for each acc. The thing that is broken is being able to launch an acc without having to enter login details.
---
Daily wars 2...
---
This in combination with a **lot** of other minor annoyances (like the lack of removing items from salvage all list) and some more major ones (like the horrible pvp balancing) are finally starting to drive me away from this game
---
Daily lockouts are what drove me away from wow, and many other mmos. Now it's starting to drive me away from gw2.
---
I would much rather get 1 gold/h than 10gold once everyday, but i see why other people would prefer it the other way around so i guess mmos just aren't for me since most of the ones i've tried are centered around a daily checklist which is so, so annoying for someone with a lot of time on their hands.
---
Lots of Istan farm, fractals, raids, etc.
---
Like, you'll need to focus on it. You won't casually make 1k in two weeks with 30 minutes put in a day. It's totally reasonable though.
---
if they do allow , here is script for autoit , just put mouse over give exotics , press f5 and enjoy.
---
    global $active , $mpos
---
    func toggle()

       if $active  Then

I got it working on Steam under flatpak.
---
1. Install GW2 following OP's instructions
---
2. Place the arcdps `d3d9.dll` in the `bin64` folder in the GW2 install.
---
3. `$ cd .var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/data/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/2147483649/pfx/` (This directory may differ, I'm not sure how Steam assigns the app id)
---
4. `$ WINEPREFIX=$(pwd) winecfg`
---
5. Libraries → New override and create an override for d3d9 (native,builtin)
---
6. Run Guild Wars 2 and arcdps should show up on the character select screen.
---
Sign me up with my Reddit name! Good luck guys, and thanks for the giveaway!

What are you talking about? Nobody is "always talking" about Fotm and raids being inaccessible. Fotm are ment to be done after you hit 80 and then slowly grind from T1's to T4's as you ascend and infuse your gear, it is end-game after all. Raid is a step up from that, hence why you cant just create a new acc and raid in 10 minutes. As for buggy dungeons, yes they are, but if we managed to do daily tours for years, so can new players (also mechanics are so really on "easy", fotm being on "medium" and raids "hard-ish", so you can kind of progress through them).
---
 I do agree it would be nice to have similar content to dungeons spread through newer maps just for the sake of having new content, even if it means only one playthrough for better players. But honestly "Open PvE&lt;world bosses&lt;dungeons&lt;t1&lt;t2&lt;t3&lt;t4&lt;CM's&lt;Raids&lt;Raid CM's" sounds okay to me. I agree with somebody doing daily CM's and multiple raid clears per week to find end-game contentless, which it kind of is. But somebody slowly progressing from the start I belive there is a lot instances to beat, through which you progress gearwise+skillwise. 
---
Just added it as clarification for others. Duno if it's just me but I managed to get confused first time I read your comment.
---
My Guardian shot off fireworks when I read the description.
---
They should probably change the ranger one to acknowledge neither elite spec cares about the animal companion (druid doesn't interact with it at all unlike every other profession mechanic in an elite spec, and soulbeast removes the pet).
---
Two of them are sitting, but no chairs.  o_O
---
That’s such a shit tier point that tries to step around the problem of skins being released into RNG traps. 
---
Yeah enjoy spending 60 weeks keyfarming for statues and a rng chance at the skin. Even then that’s when it gets released in a year (or even longer). Fucking god tier logic on that one. 
---
No problem, patch day is always crazy. 
---
Did this patch fix purple room bugs?
---
I don't think any other class really gets into the Elite spec, so no. The pet is still active for Druid, and the entire point of the Soulbeast is that your pet effects now affect you when merged. Pet mechanics are still at play in both instances, and a brand-new player doesn't need to be concerned with that honestly.
---
There are plenty of games where the ranger is a bow class, like GW1. It doesn't imply it's a bow class, but it does accurately say ranger favors range (two melee weapons, three ranged).
---
Allow me to disagree, slightly.  I think that resources invested in lower level players helps them stay engaged with the game.  There are lots of players that don't make it to level 80 simply because a leveling process rooted in idyllic exploration isn't for everyone. The story dungeons simply aren't good learning environments perhaps that was different in 2012/2013, but in 2018/2019 they're irrelevant. 
---
I mean between map completion (which i hate) and my weekly key farm I was up to almost 2 stacks of them...but i bought some back skins today...sorry you can't see a decent solution right in front of you....
---
Wow, that's quality art!
---
It might be due to the fact that they have access to both bow varieties, something no other class, elite or no, has claim to as of yet.
---
Because you gave up your position, knowledge, influence, respect in one game and you'd have to restart from the scratch.
---
I used to do daily dungeon tours for years, advanced to semi-hardcore guild, later on no. 1 end-game PvE guild then I quit for about a year. After I came back I had hard time getting into raids, not because they are hard, but having to rebuild from nearly a start would be such a hustle. 
---
Actually, it's easy to get 100 Gold/day with Istan farm. Or it WAS because it just got nerfed. I haven't tried it after the changes.
---
Don't assume that I'm not involved in either.  I'm writing this post because I'm disappointed with the general decline of interest in instanced PvE.  The game has lackluster tutorials and I'd like to see that corrected in a meaningful, fun capacity that allows for player growth, builds confidence and gets people engaged with the game. 
---
Maybe so, but 4 useless weapons are still worse than 1 useful weapon.
---
I have a probl with it because it is misleading. A lot of new players hop on ranger expecting to use Longbow in all content. Don't you think it is a disservice to those players to explicitly tell them that Rangers favor ranged combat?
---
lol
---
In other words: I'm not a "real photographer" even if I earn with it for a living or participate in exhibitions so my hands-on experience should be discarded, and I shouldn't use the [first meaning of the word "artist"](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/artist) to differentiate painters from photographers, that's why screenshots of login screens here have the same value as painted pictures. Gotcha!
---
Question is it profitable to buy ectos... salvage and sell the luck + dust.

Sorry if i just ruined it for someone

I dont have copper fed or silver fed. What should i buy? I'm confused and fed up of buying 105blue salvage kit everytime i go out.
---
*technically* Snaff did say "you're Zojja's apprentice" to Taimi, but yea no mention of her actual state.
---
If you do it once a day it's a buff
---
ust started playing last week, didn't use the boost it gave me and just got my eng to 80! Sorry you feel bored i am loving it so far!

BigGame.5368
---
Why did they get kicked off tester guilds? 
---
I'll try it tomorrow. :)
---
Seriously they put 2 new minis (that you need 31 if i understand it right) behind the meta reward mini? -__- or am i blind and those can drop from elsewhere?
---
I don't know what's so confusing about "while having auto-login unchecked".
---
Also, no idea who uses launch buddy purely for auto-login without multi-boxing when the default launcher has save email and password features.
---
You can no longer enter T1 Fractals on your own w/o being level 80.  However, I think that system does still exist albeit as an oversight. 
---
Much obliged! Gonna have to download autoit and check it out later!
---
I play NA, but EU should be the same. Open world meta maps are so full that my game crawls to 20fps. You might be getting into overflow maps that don't have many peopl. Check gw2timers.com for event start times and go to the maps 10 minutes prior. The big events like Dragons Stand, Teq, Shatterr, Triple wurm may need you to be there 20-30 minutes early since they fill up so fast
---
My build has 50% crit chance:-) I'm not a big fan of hybrid builds, that's why I have this durable and effortless build for farming and zerk/meta holo for fractals and raids. Making once the extra ascended set is really not a big deal:-)
---
Am i missing something or is that outfit extremely cantha-esque? Hype?
---
It once took me 80 keys to get the special drop, but I find it usually takes between 25-50. 
---
I go for it every month because I have a gambling problem, ahahaha :(
---
Or just make a blank account area, press clone a few times and load those?
---
I don't think "general" guides on how to play a certain class are a thing, because two things: first, it would be huge; second, I play since forever and know no one that actually plays "everything", so even if someone did such guides it would be incomplete in regards of certain aspects of the game.
---
What I CAN safely say to you is that the way you play a certain class will depend, exclusively, on the content you are playing. As for open world content, because it's extremely easy, usually it doesn't matter how you play or what you use, since anything tends to work well.
---
Thats actually fixed, the Graveling drops the plate for everyone now :D
---
Here, enjoy ur self, go wild.  
---
SAME.
---
It is fixed :)
---
IDK if I was crazy, but I haven't seen the purple plate since I did the story on the first day.
---
If you don't want to engage with people or have a conversation then don't comment.  Hide the post with RES for all I care.  
---
Oooh, nice take. She'd also be following in your footsteps by doing it. As an elder dragon, she'd presumable need a whole lot more energy than you would, but Kralkatorrik would provide it. There should also be two more dead elder dragons in the mists trying to contest it.
---
I have an [alternately evolving theory](#s "Aurene's remains are stolen by Joko's most loyal followers in an attempt to raise him from his last phylactory, which is what her remains become. This gives the impression that Aurene will be raised as a result, but only Joko is. Aurene realized she had to die, so she decided that even though it was inevitable, she could still travel through the rips in time and space. She hasn't yet realized that is what she's done when she meets up with you again in the mists, but she eventually comes to terms with how that's how she had to fulfill her purpose. Kralkatorrik is defeated, but by an ever bigger threat, and it is that threat that absorbs the dragon's power and takes his place as the "stabilizing force" of magic preventing Tyria from blowing up. The elder dragon, desperate for sustenance to revive himself, searches through the mists until he eventually reaches the realm of torment, which you reach after chasing Joko's entourage through the Mouth of Torment in an attempt to get Aurene's body back.") as well. It's always fun to come up with them, even though they may be unlikely.
---
Trust me, the token way is a grind. Oh, also runes and sigils are important to slot as well.
---
If you need a place to start, Metabattle has an open world section for casual pve builds
---
I'm in the top 200 of luck hoarders on gw2effeciency. Even if a better deal never shows up it's not worth clicking for hours. I enjoy playing the game not wasting my time.
---
Neko is a japanese word meaning cat.  It's been appropriated to describe people, usually women, who have cat ears and a tail.
---
Go do open world events, thats why they are there. Thats what new players should do, explore, do events, complete the event chain. Thats where you learn the basics and slowly progress to the next level of content. Takes 3 days to get from 1 to 80 and in that time you do learn a lot to be ready for dungeons or t1. If thats too long for some people then just watch twitch. 
---
Are.. are THOSE PLANTIGRADE FEET?! How dare
---
But I was only talking about the gear part, no point wasting gold crafting gear no? 
---
That is only around an hour of playtime. Times that by 4 and you will have gotten yourself over 1k gold in 2 weeks.
---
If you use the upvote system to determine what is true or form your own opinion, your incredible misguided.  If your conservative, go over to a liberal reddit, or if your liberal go over to a conservative reddit, and you will quickly see that just because a post gets a lot of upvotes doesn't mean you should agree with it.  
---
No attunement is dogshit, but highly dependend on your build. You obviously don't want earth on a power build, since it is literally not it's intented purpose etc. I feel like this description shouldn't be taken literally.
---
Rune of the Pack gives 125 Precision, instead of movement speed. Add to that the fact that you'll usually get permanent Swiftness from group boons, or have Mist Mobility Potion anyway, the additional movement speed isn't all that useful for PVE.
---
Wouldn't take much.
---
Just cut the cast time of the auto down to 1/2 second but lower damage by 10% then take the stationary part off of the 2.
---
Now its viable as dps.
---
By free I think he meant the questing and leveling being more open instead of restrictive like wow. 
---
Not the point of the utility. Raid/Fractals are not the only game mode available in the game also, plus the fact that those "useless" weapons have uses later on or at some point (also GS is kinda a life saver on mesmer in open world sometimes :). Also Scepter, Torch and Pistol are all very useful for condi Mirage (all game modes) or condi Mesmer (with any flavor) in WvW/PvP, same for staff on competitive modes.
---
I also think the "Favors X" is a bit weird because then people will think they have an actual advantage of playign it like X because the game says so, as if it gave them some kind of bonus. Not specifically a disservice but the wording feels wrong to me.
---
Copper-fed if you have a spare inventory slot. That said, blue salvage kits aren't worth it, Basic is what you should be getting if you're not using an infinite. I used to be against the "it's worth the 250g for the *convenience* crowd because you'd still need to visit vendors pretty often to unload minor runes and sigils, but then the sigil/rune patch happened. The copper-fed kit means you almost never need to visit vendors to clear inventory.
---
just use modmail to contact them
---
Either respond to my points or GTFO.  I didn't ask for your opinion about what I thought new players should do.  I asked for opinions about what people thought about the lack of instanced PvE until level 80.  
---
Nooooooooo I loved that outfit but I don't have enough gold...
---
you may want to reconsider. A full bank tab is 15,000 clicks since you can only do 1 at a time.
---
Living story can as well.
---
just advertise it a bit and have some really nice shiny skins of the gem store
---
Guard , core guard , dragon hunter, even firebrand, all at least somewhat viable I’d give guard a try I also came from playing thief , guard is pretty much a heavy armor thief with blocks instead of dodges, Rev is similar but I find rev clunky and can be hard to play sometimes where guard is much more friendly to those new to the class but the skill cap can be high for guard I say guard, but just know your slow :) if you want I may be able to help you with WvW and PvP it’s all I do haha 
---
Damn, what you'd like to see for 2019 is pretty stacked, and even though i would love all of that too, i feel like we won't even get a single one of them.
---
Others have said man if the same things I would have re: similarities and dissimilarities to WOW, as well as about the base game being free. 
---
I’d add that the things the devs did DIFFERENTLY, specifically the focus on eliminating grind in all its many, many forms via drop-in-at-any-moment Open World events, the way inventory works, etc. etc. etc. make GW2 unique and top-shelf even to this day, years after release, and well-worth your time investment to explore in the free version. 
---
If, after that, you feel that the devs have earned your trust (and a bit of your money, like I do), feel free to open your wallet for an Expansion (or both!) during  one of ANet’s frequent sales (I got both PoF and HoT for approx. 70% off retail, which felt like a hell of a deal), or even via gem store purchases for 100% optional cosmetic stuff like Outfits or small QOL upgrades. 
---
Bottom line is that they are months’ and months’-worth of content at all skill and experience levels l, from Story to Raids and everything in-between, and there are tons of players STILL doing every part of the game to team up with (or not) at every point. 
---
Good luck, and I hope you have fun! 
---
The dialogue windows closes after you give him 1. You would need to reposition it every time.
---
Damn, the shoulders actually look nice, but of course they're lootbox stuff. :(
---
Sad, would have paid some euros for those
---
The description of necromancer is true. They ARE monsters on the battlefield. But they are like monsters of gw2, punching bag and free kills.
---
I feel bad for any new player who will make his/her first character as necromancer thinking they will be like a monster on battlefield later to find out they are just little kids hiding and waiting for bullies to leave battlefield most of the time so they can participate atleast.
---
I went right after patch and I still haven't seen it. Where should it be?
---
I guess my post doesn't include the original reddit thread. You can find [a good discussion about the ethics of this device here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8ssxcm/art_shiny_seeker_skritt_roller_beetle_mount/e121ahc/).
---
Ideally they'll be able to get most of LWS5 out in 2019, 4 or maybe even 5 episodes if they keep to the schedule, unless we have another year of delays of course. I'd be surprised if they went to S6 rather than an expansion afterwards - they need to make money somehow, and the gem store won't keep the game running forever - but that's a bit too far ahead to speculate. There will presumably be new Raids and Fractals along with the episodes, and I personally hope we finally get SAB World 3, but anything beyond that is largely guesswork.
---
That said, we do know that they're planning to bring expansion-level content out with Living World episodes going forward, which could mean a lot of things. A lot of recent updates seem to point towards a build template system of some sort, so I'd say we might see that with S5E1, possibly even sooner, although there haven't been any official announcements yet. It's at least possible that they would give us some new Elite Specs with the new season, but that has all sorts of logistical issues unless they do all nine at once; it certainly isn't impossible, but I wouldn't put money on it without more information.
---
The thing is... you don't miss anything, that's why there's a cap. Do it on your own terms, if you miss the festival... meh, whatever. Do it next year. You just take longer, you don't miss it completely.

It's the Lunar New Year Festival, so everything is a Asian-themed.

same problem here!
---
Yup. That's why it isn't in my expected category lol
---
When I'm trying to kit out several characters in short order, it's worth investing. Especially when I only get drops in places like Fractals once in a blue moon, usually rings with stats I don't want that I need special tools to break down...
---
And regardless, trying to level my crafting disciplines requires materials. I try not to buy materials from TP but sometimes I need to supplement, and they tend to be pricey. All things told, I end up hovering at a low gold total most times, even with selling the things I craft to level my crafting disciplines (excess armors). 1k gold isn't low to some people, that was my entire point. You cherry-picked the Ascended mention without regard to any other aspect of my statement.
---
aurene's not dead lol, she's hopped up on lich magic. this is all just as planned, she's gonna be physical in the domain of the lost just like joko was, then we can get her out of there.
---
You can get more than one..theres a common roll for 2 and a rare roll for 25 if you want to count that
---
Mesmer and Elementalist are both very bad examples of what I am talking about. Warrior has the most available weapons out of all classes, yet more than half have no purpose. Warrior Greatsword was broadly used from release until 2015, and has been absolute garbage since. Longbow has been Warrior's best weapon since before that, even. Ranger? Useless altogether until Druid came out, then it was resident healer with a staff. Now? Greatsword. You can argue Ranger gets away with longbow in pvp, but that doesn't justify it being useless for pve. We have skill split. If anet truly believes Ranger favors ranged and Warrior favors melee, then they need to make it a truth.
---
This is what I use for PvE roaming:

---
I'm still experimenting with some of the Firearms choices.
---
The basic rotation is:
---
F2 and F3 used on cooldown. F4 used on cooldown while &gt;50 heat.
---
F5: Enter Photon Forge (stay in Forge until close to 100, dodge rolling to reduce heat and cause burning as much as possible)
---
3: Corona Burst on cooldown
---
4: Photon Blitz on cooldown
---
1: AA Chain
---
5: Only used when mass CC is required
---
Outside of forge:
---
3: Right out of Forge to generate Quickness
---
4: Blowtorch
---
1: Until Heat is 0 (May be worth entering Forge at 50 energy for top damage, but becomes very click heavy)
---
Utility 1: Used for closing distance
---
Utility 2: Never used for kit
---
Utility 3: Used @ &gt;50 heat
---
Elite: Used @ &gt;50 heat, especially when CC is needed
---
So... I get 30s (capped 6 seconds x 5 stacks) of Fury and Vigor **every 20 seconds**?!
---
Phobia? Don't embarrass yourself.
---
there are casual players, you know
---
catgirls were already covered by the cat-ear headband. These will be foxgirls.
---
Are you dense or what. Im telling you there is no lack of modern up to lvl 80 content, only the "instance" part is missing because there is no need for it. What you need to experience before 80 is out there in the world. Can you comperhend that? You dont need a fucking loading screen and a special team to make a fucking map, 3 bosses and 2 events because its already there in the open maps.
---
I can explain it to you again but I cant understand it to you. 
---
Aside from the Brilliance charms this rune looks absolutely tasty. Going to go farm my fair share of these and brilliance charms while I still can, once Lunar New Year is over both might start to climb in price later on.
---
I think you were dropped on your head as a baby.

then just position drooburt in the right place

---
I forgot to even mention how i feel about your expectations but, well, i feel exactly the same. I'm prepared for huge disappointment in GW2 this year.
---
I just don't see them doing anything other than Gemstore updates and LW episodes that bring an okay-at-best map with an awful-at-best meta. 
---
Hmm good to know. Have a few friends who came back to the game as well that need to unlock their elite specs, so that works out well. 
---
Balance patch??
---
Unlikely. Anet wouldnt ninja patch this/left it undocumented on the patch notes because of how big an issue it was and still currently is.
---
Thanks Dulfy!
---
*kemonomimi intensifies*
---
Have you previewed it on charr
---
5v5 cluster fuck is viable strategy now. Thats the strategic gameplay you want? Alright then. All classes have too much mobility/self sustain and damage. This is the single most cancer meta atm. Even fb+scg was better as it required teamplay atleast. Now theres no reason to even talk to anyone.
---
Are we talking about two different things? The bug was that it didn't drop the plate everytime right, only for one person? That is fixed if you kill the Graveling it would drop now for everyone. 
---
The latter
---
I guess you cant handle the fact that there is plenty of shit to be done at low levels, no need to spend more time and founds for a lvl 3 instance so that new players can feel engaged in content. Gw2 was also 1st game to introduce boss fights to pre-max level characters and they did it on every map, so really check yourself. 
---
Meh. I don't mesmer. Never could enjoy it in all honesty. So the only mesmers I have are mules or keyrunners waiting for deletion.
---
Ahri Joins the Battle!
---
Ok, here's how ya buy both expacs. Sadly, the sale just ended but keep checking gamestop.com. It is an official reseller for gw2 and can find the link in the trusted reseller section so no worries there.
---
Here's how it works (assuming you're in the US), wait on a 50% sale. Do not buy bundles from anet (one caveat on that later). Go to GameStop.com and buy each expac separately, but get the deluxe. Should be around $28 US. This way, instead of one, you get two character slots and a hunch of other goodies that do not come with the bundles from anet.
---
Only reason to get it from anet is if you want the gems. Bout a $50 value for $25. If not, buying separately from GameStop is better. Good luck.
---
Not everyone zergs. Lots of people like roaming , even on "non-roaming" classes , because they find it fun
---
You're fucking retarded.  I outlined *very* specifically what sort of content I was talking about and you ignored it multiple times because non-sensibly rambling out of context is more important to you than having an actual, meaningful conversation with someone.  My apologies if I don't engage with an HP sponge.  Wow Much Champion Such WoW. 
---
Yes. Doesn’t have all the stats but it has zerker.
---
Some people care about AP, so they do miss 50AP.
---
You said all that bs to me and then deleted your account.
---
Pathetic.
---
Axe-Axe is used often as it has a vey high dps value.
---
 Elementalists harness the power of the four elements—water, earth, fire, and air—to cast **mediocre spells!**

That's gonna get a new player's attention for sure
---
What the fuck?
---
It doesn't work for some reason.
---
I don't have a pic right now, but all four ears and horns are replaced by big fluffy fox ears
---
FWIW, I'm a very slow/lame/casual/whatever player, and have run T1 fractals maybe 3-4 times w/pugs, and have had good results.  (Well, I die a lot :/, but the other players haven't mistreated me...)  I make sure to say that I'm new before we start, and it's been good so far.
---
I've been logging onto my 4 accounts like this for about 4 years.
---
Not had one security risk.....
---
Thanks for link. Unhappy too. Though now I'm thinking where the launcher's remember password/email is stored, in what file. Would it be possible to have separate those for each account and create a switching mechanism for that?
---
[Alright, I took one](https://i.imgur.com/3vlGIA1.png)
---
These seem to be mostly aimed at refugees from other MMOs. The descriptions seem to use terms and arguments commonly used and accepted for MMOS. For example Ranger descriptions mentions skill types that are very common in other MMOs, whereas guardian descriptions do not mention a single skill types as they are not. Interesting. 
---
here's a [returning player](https://old.reddit.com/r/guildwars2/wiki/returningplayers) guide that will help you get situated back into the game.
---
What might be helpful is if you just take your thief back into some of the lower level areas again, and work your way back up when you're feeling a little bit more confident with the game mechanics.
---
The difficulty of the game tends to go core-&gt;maguuma wastes (silverwastes + dry top)-&gt;path of fire (second expansion)-&gt;heart of maguuma (first expansion)
---
Make sure that before you jump into expansion content, you're properly geared up too. Especially as someone who hasn't touched the game for a while, you're going to want at least exotic level gear.
---
I have a similar issue but have been investing a lot into crafting vipers and berserkers ascended sets for each armor type. I also have nearly every ascended weapon collection complete so switching builds is fairly easy.
---
Today I really want to run fractals, so I'll hop on my scourge and equip my viper gear. Then I might want to go farm Istan so I'll equip my wanderers set on my scrapper and tag everything on the screen. Then, throw some harriers on my druid and run with the zerg in wvw. 
---
Having the gear ready to go really makes this game alt-friendly and I see no reason to declare any of my characters as my main.
---
You're welcome! \^\^
---
Please!
---
May he stay that way. 
---
So I have artificing and been stock piling my luck drops to make them exo, what are they used for outside of increasing magic find and this? Actually worth keeping them or no?

No one was arguing against it.
---
The rune is OP for roaming but worthless in zergs.
---
While ANet is correct in that using these options possibly are a security risk (but really only if you have more than one person using that computer, which may not be the case), I would not be surprised if the real reason would be something else entirely.

(thinking about easy multiboxing, even while allowed)

You can play a core warrior (Strength, Discipline, Tactics/Arms) with Axe+Axe and do decent damage while providing good buffs for your whole 10-man-squad (Banner of Strength, Banner of Discipline).
---
I did
---
You did outline your ideas, wishes or whatever they are but im not going to argue on that because such content is not needed. If you cant step off your high horse and try to understand all the factors from your "instanced low level content" is already applied but not in order or shape you personally desire then no point posting on reddit. Yet again, all the things are already implemented in-game and set up in such a way a player can progress through it while he is learning. Anet decided how they want to introduce players to plethora of mechanics and they did it in their own way, because they are not based on your turns it doesnt mean they are not in-game at all.
---
Im going to stop now because you are not open minded at all, told you in the first post what you were specifically looking for is not needed but bridge to connect new players to high end content is there, so as content to teach players core mechanics of the game. You just want to hear positive shit about your irrelevant idea, which is not needed, not desired, not wanted and waste of resources. Pushing for it would make players even more demanding in regards of stuff being handed to them for free. 
---
it's just 1.2 gold for the whole 6 (20s/piece). 
---
- F2 is not enough when you are overwhelmed by ungrouped enemies. 
---
- Lithany of Wrath is limited - if the enemies are ungrouped you have to jump around between clusters
---
- F1 blind is good, yes, but only if all of them are around you - otherwise, if there's several clusters of ranged enemies, the rest will keep pummeling you. 
---
Go to Crystal Desert and jump in the middle of a forged army+some sand sharks at the same time, let me know how it goes :D

What a shitty move on their part. Those of us that use this feature are smart enough to know the risks and to ensure we use SMS/Email verification for extra security. Or y'know, LaunchBuddy.

Not really. It is even less true for GW1 due to multi-classing.

LS3 maps provide the easiest way to get ascendedvtrinkets including back pieces. 
---
That's sort of like saying people who text while driving but have never been in an accident weren't at any risk. They were at plenty of risk, they just got lucky.
---
Hmm. Ironically enough, I think Ranger actually favors melee in most of their meta builds.
---
Seems like a power herald wet dream.
---
only issue i have is Engi's being labeled as "Ranged or melee", and Rangers being labeled as "Favors Ranged"
---
Core Engi has no melee options I don't think, unless Tool Kit got buffed when I wasn't looking.
---
And Melee ranger can do a good amount of damage if you're going power.
---
shiii, I wasnt supposed to use more money on GW2 at this point.... but dang, those ears are just too good
---
I'm really wondering how much would be  [Shrine Guardian Appearance Package](https://imgur.com/BmwsqXX)  since it looks like, it comes with a mount skin too, I doubt it will be your normal 2k gems ?
---
Simplest way to get an exotic is probably going to be the TP. Look for stat selectable ones, check the wiki to make sure the stat set you want is available on them. If you take a gear crafting class to 400, you can also craft a level 78 exotic backpack for pretty cheap.  
---
Unfortunately, Ascended backpacks are a bit of a pain without HoT (as you're locked out of the maps that have ascended backpack vendors, and the raid wings that drop backpacks)  
---
If you have a ton of fractal relics for some reason, you can purchase the Exotic Prototype Fractal Capacitor, which is available in berserkers. This has the benefit of being upgradeable to ascended, as well.  
---
If you're willing to subject yourself to ranked PvP, you can get the ascended PvP wings.  
---
If you have PoF, you can do the Banner collections, which aren't too bad.  
---
And if all else fails, you can mystic forge a [Quiver of a Thousand Arrows](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Quiver_of_a_Thousand_Arrows), though this will cost you about 50 gold.
---
Now this I can get behind :)
---
As it is, the only reason to redo story is for achievements (which are a one time thing as well) or for alt characters. 
---
Giving it repeatable rewards and different difficulty levels (I'd love that) are great ideas.  Dailies could be interesting too.  For example, it could be another way to gain geodes with season 2 without having to do dry top.  
---
I'd add an option also to include some random elements at higher difficulty levels.  Different creatures appearing and different locations to make it fresh.  
---
And, of course, I'd love to repeat personal story the same.  So wonderful ideas.  
---
You should consider another thread for this alone to give it more visibility.
---
Thats a joke .. right? Today is first of April ... right? ... de Fuck Anet????
---
...apparently anet has run out of features/content so must resort to moves/add/changes for metric churn....
---
Nice I was very anxious about this good to have confirmation from other people than my guild who's usually trolling me lol. 
---
there is a mystic forge recipe for changing stats on any ascended piece (gear and weapons), thou sometimes it is not cheap
---
Lich dragon Aurene ^^
---
You should go back lol. Every class in gw1 favors dagger, except mesmer and the one necro who carries around an urn

Only 60 weeks! What a bargain!

Which crafting class do you need to get it? :O
---
You can't change stats on Ascended Rings and Backpacks and such.
---
So......using launchbuddy, how will you adapt to this?
---
It's that whole personal touch to their hatred. Elder Dragon's view the other races as nothing more than mere flies and have known no match beyond their own kin. Kinda raises the stakes and shows that you've been such a consistent thorn in his side he's directly gunning for YOU specifically out of everyone.  He's recognized you among all others as a true enemy and a threat.
---
Hmm. I understand that some people dislike there being a lot of art and screenshots being posted. But I feel that this gives the impression that such content is not wanted here moreso than other GuildWars-related content.
---
I'm not entirely sure where I stand on this, what I *do* think is that a flood of any one particular type of reddit thread can lead to similar feelings. Personally, I, not having played the last chapter of Living World Season 4, have been less active here because I of the amount of spoiler-related threads. As much as I understand that because it's new it's on a lot of peoples' minds it was also a bit irksome.
---
I do not know in what ways one can filter out certain threads. I'm also not certain how asking people to look at what else is currently recent and popular before posting would work. But limiting art / screenshot threads to one day a week seems a bit.. harsh. 
---
To be honest the presence of these is one of the reasons I like frequenting this subreddit.
---
&gt; [&amp;AgGZXwEAAA==]	
---
For god's sake the name of the class is RANGER..
---
As did my backline Herald.
---
I'm honestly surprised at how many people are treating their ability to quickly switch between accounts as more important than the security of those accounts, but different people have different priorities I suppose.
---
For all of you who are still determined to put your passwords at risk in the name of convenience, it would be pretty easy to whip up a quick macro in AutoHotkey that would do about the same thing with about the same level of security. It probably wouldn't be quite as fast, but it would still be faster than entering every email and password individually, and you could even make a nice little UI with buttons and such if you were so inclined. Heck, if there's enough interest I'll whip up a quick tutorial when I get home (along with a disclaimer against any lost accounts due to using it, of course).
---
Can confirm focus at least is still bugged, I even waited till after patch to kill the Temporal Storm. Didn't even bother with rifle after that.
---
Perfect, I missed the mount skin and even if I hardly play right now, I'll get this set!!
---
I know linux users aren't the target, but I have to use auto login because the launcher will freeze my PC unless I run the whole game windowed. C'mon Anet
---
Ok.
---
Can you expand and share?
---
&gt; churn
---
I've just realized how much I've grown to *hate* this word.
---
tell us more!
---
yeah, I'm falling for this bait.
---
I'm ok with that, can always created a local.dat file for each of the alt accounts that used to have an autologin shortcut, and use "remember password" in each, then make a .bat that copies local.dat.accountNumberX to Local.dat before starting the game. Safer indeed.
---
BUT they should fix the following
---
* having both login+password saved still displays login screen
---
* more annoying, the "start automatically" checkbox doesn't really work. It has a 5s timer, so you need to click "play" anyway.
---
CHRIS CLEARY WHAT ARE YOU DOING
---
3.25g per stack? Not bad.... if only didn't require so much clicking 
---
I wouldn't have to sift through art to get to, you know, actual discussion about the game
---
Damn that's good, I mean no precision or ferocity or anything but still pretty good.
---
Gotta take into account that it's "only 1k gold" because of the centuries it must've taken to even accumulate enough luck to get that much from this considering 1k luck = 7s 4c
---
If somebody has access to your (you being the average user's) computer in such a way that they could get the files storing usernames and passwords, and wanted them, your account is already compromised whether or not you were using an autologin feature, through keylogging.
---
Id be curious to know if the usernames and passwords using the 'remember account details' tickboxes (which have never actually worked for me) are even stored in a way that is secure. Could an intruder just go in and pluck the dat files?
---
Can you expand a bit on this? 
---
Not really, texting while driving takes away attention from driving itself, i could save my passwords in a txt file on my desktop called "passwords" and could be considered safe if i don't put my computer in a spot where it can be compromised by someone else.
---
There is a point where you can have enough security on your computer that it'd take a dedicated hacker to get into it at which point an "average personal computer user" is fucked no matter what they do the moment they get targeted by someone like that and probably their gw2 password would be the least of their problems.
---
Your example just sucks.
---
anet needs to stop hiring the square enix devs, not that the wolf ears are original but they are pixel for pixel just like https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/jp_blog/JP20171016_me_01.png
---
After you've logged on, other persons can read it if you leave the room, it can be copied ie remote session, copied by not logging on but instead booting from a dvd or usb stick etc. because it was not encrypted. To get the account and password now they would need to install a keylogger. 
---
It was indeed a security risk. Just because you didn't personally have issues doesn't mean it was safe.
---
I used this for a few alt accounts that I use only to gather dailies. NEVER for my main accounts !
---
&gt; if i don't put my computer in a spot where it can be compromised by someone else.
---
you are connected to the internet. That's enough.
---
Off-hand sword is not great. You can use it in open-world, but I wouldn't encourage it for raiding.
---
 [**Crystal Circuit Racer**](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/All_or_Nothing_(achievements)#achievement4545) is still bug...
---
*"This was unintended and we have a fix coming soon™. Individual players should be able to earn achievements even when partied together, as long as it makes sense in the context of the achievement.*   
---
*For example, Electrophobia is a personal responsibility achievement, and should be awarded to individual players based on whether or not they completed their individual responsibilities (in this case, not getting hit by lightning). Stubborn, on the other hand, asks that you complete the instance without using any of the helpful buffs, so either the whole group participates and earns the achievement, or no one does (we made this a choice of the instance owner in the conversationdef, but you get the idea.) "*

I am looking to get into raiding with a Healing Druid, but I am having trouble figuring out how to obtain the right gear. According to Snowcrows, I need harrier stats for all of my gear. I want to obtain a set of Harrier exotics first, and then work my way up to an ascended set. However, I do not see it on TP, and would prefer to avoid crafting if at all possible. What is the best way to go about obtaining Harrier exotics for my healing druid? Thanks!
---
Of the now five festivals that we have, LNY is one of the smallest (as well as SAB which I only call a festival because the game does).
---
Likely people will focus more on Thunderhead for a while regardless, so really doesn't matter when it released. Hell, they could have done it at the same time and there would be no issue.
---
It's probably more interesting as an alternative to the recent diviners renegade build as Heralds already have Facet of Elements
---
So, when does Ashes of Creation come out?
---
The typical batch file setup makes account-specific copies of %APPDATA%/Guild Wars 2/Local.dat that have the email and password saved, rather than including the email and password in plaintext in the batch file.
---
Example:
---
    @echo off
---
    copy "%APPDATA%\Guild Wars 2\Local-Acct1.dat" "%APPDATA%\Guild Wars 2\Local.dat"
---
    "C:\Guild Wars 2\Gw2-64.exe" -maploadinfo -bmp -autologin
---
    copy "%APPDATA%\Guild Wars 2\Local.dat" "%APPDATA%\Guild Wars 2\Local-Acct1.dat"
---
Apparently your first run will drop more year but the chests will be capped at 12 for the GH and 30 for Pala, so people who run the meta it once a day will likely keep the market stable. The only difference will probably be more commanderless groups, I think.  
---
&gt; Not had one security risk.....
---
It's a risk, the definition of a risk is that it will not happen 100% but that it may happen.
---
https://i.gyazo.com/251555c81361452b01e49ca42788db4e.png
---
Vigor stacking intensity instead of duration would be interesting
---
The boons are only on yourself tho? would be a nice alternative for pack to get vigor in the non druid party
---
Raids are pretty downhill pretty quickly, but my bad on stating it was one rather than two since pof. 3 fractals "recently" means three very easy fractals in the last year? More? Yeah I'll leave him to believe raids and fractals are doing great.
---
he's not responsible for security for about a year
---
first you need to go to "%APPDATA%\Guild Wars 2\" and make a copy of the "login.dat" file, give it a distinct name. this file contains your login data for the last account you used.
---
second step is to create a .bat file that contains the following:
---
    copy "%APPDATA%\Guild Wars 2\Local - Localxyz.dat" "%APPDATA%\Guild Wars 2\Local.dat"
---
    "C:\Program Files (x86)\Guild Wars 2\Gw2-64.exe" -autologin -mapLoadInfo 
---
    copy "%APPDATA%\Guild Wars 2\Local.dat" "%APPDATA%\Guild Wars 2\Local - Localxyz.dat"
---
obviously you might have to adjust the file paths.
---
after that just create a shortcut to the .bat file, right click -&gt; properties, and change the execution drop down to minimized.
---
repeat for every account, obviously with different names for the copied .dat files.
---
There is no security risk of using the command line as opposed to typing them in inside the application.
---
I don’t understand the problem. My game works fine. Y’all must be doing shit in gray areas.  Also im glad to know my information is kept safe
---
I would personally Mix Valk with zerk and maybe add some toughness in there, in WvW speaking because a guard has a trait like that gives you a huge boost in critical chance while you have retal up, also run Dura runes would be ideal:) 
---
which is funny because they just updated their guidelines which includes multi-boxing.  They stated before and now again that multiboxing is 100% OK but they just made it a whole lot harder.  Honestly, fuck Anet for this.
---
PM the mods, they'll edit it
---
I don't think it "doesn't matter" if she comes back. I know we're all kind of jaded when it comes to death in TV and video games, but *almost* losing your baby is pretty damn traumatic on it's own.
---
Please no.  Just scale and give same level rewards.  
---
There are already areas like raids and fractals (high levels) that force multiple people.  And while you can do dungeons and many fractals solo, it takes so much longer that it's not worth it many times.
---
As much as possible, gameplay should award both solo and teamplay.  Rewarding one more penalizes the other.  People have different playstyles and preferences and keeping it equal respects that.
---
The real problem isnt that they disabled the feature, but they - again - do NOT offer an ALTERNATIVE. This seems to be the way to go now for anet. Be it balancing, login, whatever. Accept it or leave. 
---
Anet has one of the most shittiest launchers Ive ever had the displeasure of using in a mmo.
---
I mean, seriously, even DAoC already had a multi-account with stored accountnames AND characternames for direct login. And that game is older than gw1.
---
&gt;&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt;[Dan has a mighty bladder!](https://i.redd.it/m2dq9we4lub21.jpg)
---
&gt; just tell that you won't offer support for people if they use these options for login on their account or something instead of flat-out disabling it. 
---
Queue multiple posts a week on here on here along the lines of "Support is total garbage and REFUSED to help me!" followed by a bunch of idiots telling them to demand a senior GM. Including a feature while saying that you don't officially support it simply doesn't work -- people are going to ask for support on it and support reps will have to spent time telling people "no" and then defusing the situations when people inevitably get upset.
---
Not that any of that matters, because the real issue is that accounts getting compromised because of an insecurity is a way beyond just a simple support issue.
---
Yes, but not AtRangers. They range out in the wild, not just shooting at range.
---
Thanks. I added it to the wiki.
---
Yea if you think that way then you are a nutcase. Trust me.
---
Being connected to the internet means nothing anymore, basic security is easy to comeby and most ppl have it. Anything above the basic security is not needed for 99% of the shit out there. Majority of "hacks" come from social hacking and such, not actual computer hacking. 
---
If people get "hacked" due to random pishing mails and such, this changes nothing. For any advanced user, unless you give physical access to your computer there is very little risk to have things in plain sight as long as you do basic security. As i said, anyone that targets you specifically and has to means to do harm over that, you will not save yourself but they have better and more rewarding shit to do than trying to hack into your game account.
---
This random fear-mongering is stupid.
---
So right now until a LB Patch is release, no rush, just remove account credentials and manually login to each client?
---
It is a bad PvE-spec. It was designed interely around it's role in PvP. 
---
It makes sense, thanks, more reason for me to buy just outfit.
---
I like how my inbox is full every time I check the day after. Better content than the game the last few years.
---
Subreddit mods can't change post titles.
---
Check metabattle. It has meta roaming builds.
---
No matter how obviously stupid or wrong statement you make, there will always be people who won't understand sarcasm and loose their shit %)
---
shenjh already replied, but as you can see, the login data isn't actually included in the batch file. otherwise this method would have been just as affected, and not been worth mentioning.
---
The security risk isn't about expediting the login process, it's about the fact that with the disabled method, your login credentials were stored *in plain text in the command line/crash logs.*
---
Sure, if you let someone sit in your chair and login they can have their way, but now it's much harder for someone to, say, request your crash logs and have your login credentials in hand, or for someone remote accessing/otherwise accessing your computer's files to steal that info.
---
Anet: Multiboxing is okay
---
Also Anet: Get fucked
---
Yeah, I know, but you can change ascended trinkets stats if you obtain them  with Rubies. 
---
Unfortunately harriers is an expansion armor type, so it cannot be purchased from the tp. The ascended  accessories can be obtained via the ls4 maps but the armor you pretty much have to craft. 
---
Also as with most expansion gear, crafting exotic can be almost as expensive as ascended. But with less time gated materials. 
---
No?  I thought they could.  My bad.
---
At the rate, i'm gaining luck, i'll have another 300 stacks by then
---
I think it did the sneaking again.
---
I get white screens again on v1.8.2 Version: 94812.
---
With this method, you don't need to enter your password or email because the login.dat saves the information as long as you click to save the password?
---
Will this though allow you to multibox, that is have multiple accounts open at once?  
---
42g an hour is realy not worth my time. 
---
well considering you can have all the magic find in the world and still hardly ever get rare drops, probably isn't the worst thing to just sell it all.
---
Yeah, at work, wondering if I'll be able to do some dailies tonight or not...
---
:(
---
Hmm, still, I wonder if this is something that the developer of launchbuddy can use to workaround so we can still use that program and be able to multibox as before.
---
Yup. And disabling plain email and password is a good thing in my opinion. There's the option to swap the local.dat file in and out whenever you need them. I suggested a couple of months ago on the launchbuddy repo to make use of that and symlinks. However as far as I know there's no progress on that yet. If that would be implemented, I feel many people here wouldn't complain as much as now.
---
However, I do feel arenanet should have added a replacement command line parameter to pass the local.dat file it should use. That would make it a lot easier because you don't need to swap these files back and forth in one way or another.
---
On another note, I can't help but feel [this xkcd is relevant](https://xkcd.com/1172/).
---
Is it ascended or exotic? 
---
I used a local.dat file for each account and a command prompt of sorts to select each account. 
---
Good ole flat bow on warrior to pull and body block mobs
---
You'd need to go out of the room to hand in the first plate to get the Light of Deldrimor effect to reveal the chest.  
---
I can't speak to every part of ArenaNet's crash report generation, but from the ones I've seen it appears that they dump a whole slew of relevant information. I imagine knowing what sort of command line launcher arguments are in place can help their teams understand why a user is crashing or experiencing odd behavior with their game.
---
It *would* be nice if the login credentials were censored if you used these options, though as I said - I'm not in a position to know if such a thing is possible with how these crash logs are generated (I assume it must be, though it would probably still take a short while to implement such a change - I wouldn't doubt that disallowing the use of this command is a quick band-aid fix until they build such anonymization into the crash logs.)
---
Yes. I’ll have to check tonight and see how I did it. 
---
what a bad move ... come on anet, if you only just realize after all these years that storing login info in clear text is not the best idea dont be lazy and just disable it altogether, give us the option to use autologin without having the login info in clear text....
---
its not that hard...
---

&gt; # Late Notes: January 22, 2019
---
&gt;# 01/22/2019—Late Notes
---
&gt;- Fixed an issue with the &amp;quot;Chasing Tales: Asaliea the Channeler&amp;quot; achievement in Thunderhead Peaks in which the third deed, &amp;quot;Chasing Tales: Torrent of Magic,&amp;quot; wasn&amp;#39;t giving the correct reward.
---
&gt;- Fixed an issue that could prevent the chests for the &amp;quot;Defeat the Wrathbringer&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Defeat Sulypix before it drains your reclaimed oil&amp;quot; events from being available after the daily reset.
---
&gt;- Increased the rewards in the boss chests of the &amp;quot;Defeat the Wrathbringer&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Defeat Sulypix before it drains your reclaimed oil&amp;quot; events.
---
&gt;- Changed reward chests for the &amp;quot;Defeat the Wrathbringer&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Defeat Sulypix before it drains your reclaimed oil&amp;quot; events to be awarded once per character per day instead of once per account per day.
---
&gt;- Moved the Light of Deldrimor Plate halves out of the boss chests and into event bonus chests, which are available once per account per day.
---
&gt;- Fixed a bug in which the graveling in the dwarven catacombs would only award one plate at a time.
---
&gt;- Changed Pepperseed&amp;#39;s indicator to be visible on the map, and doubled the broadcast radius for the &amp;quot;Escort Pepperseed back to the Zephyrite Docks&amp;quot; event in Thunderhead Peaks.
---
&gt;- Increased the broadcast radius of events in Thunderhead Peaks to improve visibility of events on the map.
---
&gt;- Fixed a bug in Thunderhead Peaks in which Sayida&amp;#39;s conversation regarding the supply lines happened at the wrong time. The conversation now happens when players complete the renown heart for the area.
---
&gt;- Players now have more time to resupply Sunflower after the second ambush in the &amp;quot;Help Pepperseed deliver Zephyrite supplies to the Forge&amp;quot; event.
---
&gt;- Players can now resupply Sunflower during and after the third ambush in the &amp;quot;Help Pepperseed deliver Zephyrite supplies to the Forge&amp;quot; event, but not after the event completes.
---
&gt;- Sandswept Isles: Fixed an issue that could cause beetles in the ranch events to stay hidden, stalling the events.
---
&gt;## World Polish
---
&gt;- Frostgorge Sound: The end of Magellan&amp;#39;s Memento is once again guarded by a giant blue ooze (with a chest!).
---
&gt;- Straits of Devastation: Fixed a rare stall in the hero challenge event near the Cathedral of Glorious Victory.
---
&gt;- Tangled Depths: Fixed a bug that could cause Agent Zildi to become unresponsive and refuse to speak to players.
---
&gt;- Logging out or changing maps while using a pipe organ will no longer leave the pipe organ permanently in use.
---
There are alternatives 
---
I am a melee elementalist...
---
What exactly do you mean by 'ungrouped enemies'? They all travel in packs. Just move towards ranged mobs, melee mobs will follow you to them, pull all ranged together using GS5, get any stragglers with GS3.
---
You don't have to melee stuff while ranged mobs pound you. You are not an NPC. 
---
If you need extra survivability pop focus 5 for block/big aoe. If you want extra mobility and AoE use sword for second teleport/projectile hate/aoe auto. 
---
Also F1 is plenty enough to keep most damage off of you, since it comes off cooldown every time you kill *anything*. 
---
Litany of Wrath is the most powerful heal in the game and will easily top you off even at no health as long as you use any damage skill, especially on a big pack of mobs.
---
To me your build/utilities sound like a much bigger issue. Guardian is like one spec that literally has zero issues in PoF at all, like what the fuck are sand sharks going to do to you with on-demand stability? 
---
Run Radiance, use Valkyrie set, facetank everything.
---
But annoying to use. 
---
Got it in about 35 here. Also got a cloth gather rune that sells for 130gish so that was nice.
---
I noticed an unusual spike in price for Lunar New Year fireworks yesterday.
---
Someone gave away info or obtained it early (probably multiple individuals)
---
Is it every 20s while in combat or every 20s when you **ENTER** combat?
---
Wouldn't an ideal solution have been for anet to remove this as they have, but to put in the ability to add details to an *encrypted* launcher? Removing one without adding the other feels a lil meh.
---
This is stupid. Is somebody really going to break into my house, figure out the password to my computer, and then focus on stealing my Guild Wars account?
---
&gt; weekly key farm takes like 15 minutes if less with mounts....you always get one with decent chances at more per week...problem solved
---
"just get a job, buy 50 keys and hope you get it...problem solved"
---
How are you gonna kill 2 elder dragons and still just be a nobody? 
---
Oh, the bot seems to have gotten its act together, again.
---
Would recommend also having a mistforged chest so you can have ALL THE STREAMERS on the go.
---
The only dual wield warrior weapons I can recommend someone use is axe/axe mace/mace on a base power warrior. I am honestly a little curious why you are dead set on dual wielding something as opposed to mixing and matching weapons which is just simply more effective. I mean you can use whatever you want in open world or with friends in any instanced content.
---
That’s not even funny! I bought all those accounts because this FEATURE existed!! Give me my money back anet 
---
Well, pressing the "remember name and password" ticks with the -autologin command works fine, so it's not a big deal.
---
&gt; I don’t understand the problem.
---
Then you shouldn't comment.
---
&gt; Y’all must be doing shit in gray areas. 
---
No, the people who are upset by this were using the command line tools that were provided by Arenanet and detailed on the Arenanet owned wiki, and they using those tools exactly as they were designed to be used.
---
&gt; Fixed a bug in which the graveling in the dwarven catacombs would only award one plate at a time.  
---
THIS is great. Best note of the patch.
---
that would be a sh*t way going agains multiboxing, you can still do it without autologin it just makes it more bothersome and time intensive ... something with hurts regular players more then the ones who abuses multiboxing. But yeah we know that anet doesnt care about sensless security (lfg blocks you after like 5 edits, you can only send 2 mails at once etc)
---
Crashing within minutes of loading on a map. Sometimes instantly, sometimes it takes up to 5 minutes. Did a repair, have no plugins (no arcdps, I know). Happens with lowest graphics settings, happens with highest. Can't really do anything.
---
“Yeah we got the moon. What are ya going to do without tides, Peru!”
---
While.
---
Yeah, I totally get that and hope that it's the case, too. I'm sometimes a bit of an optimist, so I take the opposite thought process (at least from the majority of folks in the thread here, it seems) and guess that that is probably the case, but I know as much as you guys do. :P
---
I don't frequently multibox, but I do login to about 5 accounts daily for key farms, daily rewards, etc. As such, I can only wonder - how inconvenient would a batch file workaround (for those who understand the risks) or a change to multi-login third party tools to store and auto-enter multiple account credentials be?
---
It doesn't seem at all like multiboxing is being completely blocked by this change (thank goodness,) but just changed and perhaps made temporarily more inconvenient. I hope that either ArenaNet implements an alternative, or something like LaunchBuddy gets a workaround built in. :)
---
&gt; Fixed an issue with the "Chasing Tales: Asaliea the Channeler" achievement in Thunderhead Peaks in which the third deed, "Chasing Tales: Torrent of Magic," wasn't giving the correct reward.
---
It might be fixed for people completing Torrent of Magic going forward, but it's still broken for those of us that already had it completed.
---
I love the ears but I'm SO sick of loincloths
---
Thank you, guess I'll switch over to that some time soon.
---
duno why thread got locked :(
---
Im sad we get this „Canthan“ items without any Canthan content.
---
&gt;Logging out or changing maps while using a pipe organ will no longer leave the pipe organ permanently in use.
---
So thats why they all was broken nearly permanently. 
---
Sorry, but I don't buy that this thing has been a feature for 6 and a half years and we haven't seen a support crisis or wide spread account compromises.  
---
The security reason is absolute BS.  Who is going to get into my password protected system,  through internet security, to view my plain text shortcut.  There is a bigger security issue when I let digital river touch my credit card information.  
---
This is just a subtle way of trying to hamstring multi boxing and people using multiple accounts because they are starting to view it unhealthy for the game, but they can't walk it back.
---
Buy daily allotment of expensive envelopes (16 I believe), open them, then sell to vendor for slightly more money most of the time. 
---
Key strings based on your computer's hardware ID should be good. You have to log in to the website once and have it scan your computer for hardware IDs and then it can make a unique key for you based on that. Then you could make the appropriate shortcut and the key string.
---
They already use DigitalRiver for the gem store financial processing and I know DigitalRiver has a product offering that is exactly what I describe above because a company I worked for used it.
---
Yup. Which you should do even if it was optional, as there are 2 hidden chests per room and they drop the Jewels too.
---
Basically, no. 
---
Spellbreaker itself is bad except for one or two raid bosses, the meta is either core warrior with axe/axe for DPS, mace/mace for CC, or berserker with longbow and sword/torch, and in both cases you are only there to bring banner of strength and banner of discipline for the party, you're going to be doing mid to shit tier DPS.
---
If you must have two swords then play alacrity renegade or DPS chrono. There is currently not even an 'off-meta but 80% viable' build for dual wield sword for warrior. 
---
Play boonbeast. Wait for Mesmer to stealth by pressuring them. Stealth yourself. Nail them when they come out of stealth. Heal as necessary. Rinse repeat until they die or run.

&gt; I wouldn't doubt that disallowing the use of this command is a quick band-aid fix until they build such anonymization into the crash logs.
---
They've had this flaw for **years**. If this is a quick band-aid then the wound has already become infected. They could have simply waited a little bit longer and released it with a crash-log fix if they wanted to.
---
No. They're not replacing this unless we create a lot of backlash. And I'm not sure we can, as there aren't really enough people that use this to make a fuss (I don't think).
---
Curious: how is it possible that there are people using the "Committed"title (earned by having a 9 year old char)?
---
On GW2Efficiency there are about 12.000 people who have it unlocked... [https://gw2efficiency.com/account/unlock-statistics?filter.key=titles&amp;filter.search=committed](https://gw2efficiency.com/account/unlock-statistics?filter.key=titles&amp;filter.search=committed)
---
Don't sleep on certain t5's too
---
Beings that both the event annual and dailies have capped AP it isn't like you won't or can't catch up. It may take a bit longer because you are behind but the finish line hasn't moved. Also comparing 50AP 1 time a year to 10AP 365 (3650 total) times a year is a stretch. Bummer your pc crapped out and your hellfire back piece is now 50AP "lost" but the system isn't that bad. 
---
Committed is a title you earn from defeating a raid boss with the challenge mote active.
---
GW2 has been evolving since day 1. Also with the influx of new players, they're playing it safe and getting their security  issues fixed. Just because something has been the same for 6 years doesn't mean it should stay like that. There will be a bunch of workarounds in due time. It's been less than 12 hours and everyone is freaking out. Yes it's a inconvenience but it's not the end of the world and there will be more secure ways shortly. 
---
Also it didn't "change under the radar" they posted a forum post pretty quickly about it. They're communicating a lot with the community and providing reasons. If they disabled the option and made no effort to explain why, maybe it'd be a bigger deal, but it's not. 
---
You must really be fun at parties . . .
---
Tools that were never approved and are in the gray area.  God why do i even bother commenting.  This reddit is a hive mind....
---
Shame it's in a lootbox.
---
Haha I love that they do this right after easing up restrictions on multiboxers. 
---
Well boy's we encouraged this last week so how can we be consistently inconsistent and fuck them this week? 
---
Thank you anet from encrypted Buddy login saves I will change to Notepad document named GW2 Accounts and will copy paste - the best security!
---
I would add Fractals somewhere in around dungeons, probably. Because early fractals require no special gear and are a huge part of level 80 and gearing up!
---
Great outfit but I still want to disappear the shoulders.   
---
New Year mail is empty

---
They auto lock announcements when they want no discussion on said matter
---
Ah, so it would make sense that LB is broken since it would use the `-email` and `-password` parameters for logging in. I'll just wait patiently for a fix.
---
I need that outfit so badly. 
---
&gt;have it stored in unsecured text in other places anyway
---
*shudder*
---
Anyone who thinks this applies to them, please just use a password manager instead of inventing your own insecure method!
---
i dont care about the rewards I care about the leaderboard, and everyone there is 50ap away now.
---
only when i get to wear my exalted shoulders
---
Hooray!
---
I'm using axe and pistol right now as well, occasional torch swap. But I had trouble getting clones up with the GS variant 
---
That's true. Puts a dent in my theory.
---
They removed -email and -password launch parameters so yeah it broke launchbuddy 
---
The only way you can get better at anything is to keep playing that class.
---
For the record it is one of the easiest rotations outside of maybe deadeye. You basically spam sword 2 and summon all phantasms as quickly as possible.
---
Oh yeah. Of course. Sadface 
---
A few Guild Hall upgrades and [decorations](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Red_Lantern_(decoration\)).
---
You can still make it kinda work. Just leave your account info in launchbuddy for each account empty. That way you launch multiple accounts but you have to put your info in each launcher to get to your accounts.
---
It's would be framed as you are part of the greater group that banded together to beat a powerful for.
---
&gt;the decision was based solely on our concerns for player security
---
Bullshit. The players have been able to use -email and -password since gw1 release (2005) and gw2 release. If security was such a concern, disabling 2 command line arguments could have been done years ago.
---
This change conveniently happens the very same day the Lunar Festival is enabled. And with it, those daily lucky envelopes that basically let you multiply gold.
---
I'd like dual wielding sword ele so I can use my fiery sword and the ice version of it but it will never happen, only sb got dual weapons Dx
---
This is a dumb question, but I haven't played this game since release and I think got my character up to level 70ish before I stopped playing for one reason or another. I'm tempted to open it back up and see if I have fun with this game again, but I know there's been 2 expansions that I don't own and who knows how many other changes over the past... 6 years or so since I stopped playing!
---
So obviously I'll find out once this is done installing, but any broad strokes anyone could paint for me about what's different, what I should do to hop back in, recommendations if I should start a new character or pick up where I left off? I'm basically coming into this blind despite having a highish level character. I really don't remember anything!
---
Thanks for any help.
---
"It's been unsafe for years now we want it to continue to be unsafe!"
---
This community is absurd some times. The in game community is usually pretty good but man, this subbreddit and the forums are so entitled some times.
---
The race, the setting, the style... all of this together is so incongruent that I just love it :D
---
I'm with you there. All the minimalistic and artistic  design of it make me cry of happiness and puke at other games
---
Yeah.. im using generated passwords so I dont even know it.. ill have to open browser lastpass extension and copy it every time
---
You can practice it at the trainings golem in lion's arch. You must try it for yourself, how good you can handle the rotation and come in terms with the class in general.
---
For me, it is a really refreshing playtsyle to play chrono as dpa instead of support like the last years ago. It is not beginner friendly, but imo not too complex, if you get the timings right.
---
2 and 4 on greatsword will make a clone. You can use 2 again or use jaunt if using Self-Deception trait near one of the clones to generate the 3rd. Not as easy as axe but can still get them up pretty quickly. 
---
Ah, allright. I was mistaken because wiki has the birthday titles for the next 4 years up already and committed is mentioned there for birhtday year 9.
---
Thanks for the info.
---
It was his first piece about charrs D: you won't find anything else featuring them
---
Mocking, yeah. But phobia? Fear? Not seeing it.
---
Unfortunately, they actually removed -email and -password. This breaks LB completely in it's current state.
---
Really online (gaming) communities about anywhere sadly. Outrage always sells.
---
Yeah I don't know if there was a mistake/double up on that or whatever but the people who currently have Committed got it from MO. 
---
Same feature is still live and functional in Guild Wars 1. As long as it is not removed there i call bullshit on your security concerns. Or is security in GW1 not important? If you linked your accounts they even use the same password!
---
What happens if you throw snowflakes at him?
---
Update: I lwent home on my lunch break, bought the staff, and turned my Sylvari Ranger into a cutesy pig aesthetic. Also named her pet pig "Truffles" while I was at it. Happy Lunar New Year everyone!
---
Thanks! I'll keep that in mind. 
---
There are a few ways. The "best case" scenario is for [this request](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/66646/in-light-of-removing-email-and-password-please-correct-localdat/p1?new=1) to come through. But we have other options that have been toyed with previously.
---
In all honesty, if both of those requests are fulfilled, it will be a bit of a weird workflow but easy to implement. If the second is not... It's going to get wonky.
---
QUIT REPORTING EVERY COMMENT IN THIS THREAD.
---
Seriously. Whoever is doing it, quit it. You are making it impossible for the mods to actually do our job when the queue is filled up with someone being stupid.
---
I'll probably end up downloading it and seeing if I can run it. :) 
---
I think you're in the wrong subreddit.
---
I'm glad the devs have a good headspace for this game. I'll check it out. :) 
---
Oh, that sucks. Thanks for the info.
---
Hey, might want to throw a Spoiler tag on there
---
At least, it is Guild Wars related 
---
When running with -sharearchive the game will not write to the stored settings file. Try running the client normally, setting your preferences, and then closing "properly" (don't force close, just close as normal through the UI)
---
That said, you likely cant test the result at the moment given the changes to command lines.
---
Started to wonder if winterberry farm with volatile tool would be better for VM then the new Istan. This is the end. :'D
---
Unfortunately i stopped doing these kinds of  "upgrades" for festival minipets a long time ago.
---
It started with one wintersday i believe with skrit and their gifts? then they added new ones for haloween and each new holiday festivities.... but i just couldnt be bothered in spending soo much gold to get 3 minipets ....of which lets be honest , i wont be actually using since i have other better looking and more "prestiege" minipets to follow me around than a lantern, or a large snowball .....or a large ANGRY snowball...
---
eso rotations are usually easier, but the transition between the games is not usually slow. 
---
It is about as unsafe of saving your credit card info on a merchant site or the game even.  Nobody is breaking into people's computers to view their Guild Wars 2 short cuts.  Security reason is a crock of shit.   
---
   
---
They are doing this to hamstring multiboxers and multiple account owners.
---
Ohhh oh no, that outfit is to tempting. I already love the shrine jackal skin...
---
You can wait a sec before being sassy, alright?
---
Ah, yes. Susan, wife of Labyrinthine Horror and Deep Sea Dragon, Steve.
---
Susan, the true successor to the power of Balthazar.
---
Susan, who singlehandedly incapacitates NA WvW servers and then brags about it on the in-game chat.
---
Susan, no, I don't have a phone.
---
There's...no sass in my comment.
---
You and I both know that that's not what that refers to, but if you're gonna be like that then I'm out
---
Someone doesn't login in multiple accounts to get the daily reward, I see.
---
use /r/guildwarsgonewild for post like these. 
---
A more accurate simile would be saving your full credit card number, exp date, name, zip, and CVC to a notepad doc you keep saved on a dropbox account.
---
Damn, was hoping they might fix DH's F1 against C.A. finally.  
---
Reminds me of Akira Toroyama’s style

Aurene comes back anyway so why all the fuss?
---
but instant of just disabling it the could still gave us us autologin without the need of using cleartext if the wanted, there are enough ways to do it come on
---
For a while I Yarr!-ed my way around the world with the pirate rune, because extra summon. Unfortunately that parrot will keep you in combat forever, as it'll never break away from mobs it attacked ... so that turned out to be annoying.
---
[Looks so.](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/66631/command-line-options-changed)
---
Hasn't it been always like this? I did not test this, but i have the impression that you did always loose some height even if you flapped asap.
---
What? What did i post that would make you think i thought that?
---
I think either Path of Fire or Heart of Thorns was revealed when the player beat the last of the living story before that in a cinematic.
---
Are Spirit Shards important/hard to come by? I have a lvl 73 char that I wanna push to 80 with some left over Tomes of Knowledge I have and wondering if it’s worth it so I don’t have to buy a new set of armor for the last few levels.
---
Also just I make sure: when I “transmute” an item appearance it actually changes to look of the item and not overwrite anything in that slot.
---
Hey OP what class is the character in the painting?
---
Lol, completely baseless?  Seriously, why has this not been an issue for 6.5 years but all of a sudden it is? 
---
I knew what this clip was gonna be and im not sure if i should be proud of that :D
---
there was no "visual" explosion of magic for zhaitan, but lorewise we know that his magic got released into the environment. tequatl barely had magic, just like the shatterer or claw of jormag. and glint is more on palawa joko level in magic i guess, and her death would only release a cloud of magic and not an explosion.  
---
aurene however ate the whole magic of joko, part of mordremoth magic (who already got some of zhaitans magic) and part of balthazars magic (who got the magic of a bloodstone and absorbed some of primordus and jormags magic)
---
"Aurene comes back anyway so why all the fuss" &lt;mock mock&gt;
---
&gt;LaunchBuddy
---
Just so you know, LaunchBuddy handles this in a similar manner. While your creds are not stored in a readable state, we *do* pass that info along to the client in the same way.
---
Honestly fuck them. I had to reset my pass cause I forgot what I used here. I tried 3 new unique complicated password and NONE OF THEM was available..... now I have to think a completely new pass that I have to learn, type and waste my time here ... but hey I feel so fkn secure now no problem  
---
Guess I should use their pass suggestion.. "cooking wonder leave faint" yea sure I will learn this and use every day.......
---
I know you have literally one interest and it's Guild Wars 2 but if you take a small peek around anywhere else in the site, it's full of hate
---
Any chance you tried killing the achievement mob again with a focus and seeing if you get the drop?
---
My two friends and I got guilded hollow the other day for like our 10 person guild. The three of us are the most active members and decided to go for a hall. It's pretty do-able, just be prepared to die a lot.  
---
And ofc as others have said, try asking after octovine.
---
was never a thing unless you had increased endurance regeneration (bond of vigor, collecting volatile magic), or hugged the very outside border of the playable area on a given map (weird movement interaction and obviously not part of the intended experience).
---
If you can run GW2, you can run AutoHotkey - probably a few hundred times over, in fact. It's also dead easy to use once you learn the basics, although the language it uses is a bit eccentric. Just be advised that some antivirus software may take issue with it; it's perfectly safe, to be sure, but it operates at a fairly low level so it can look like malware under certain circumstances. 
---
I think LaunchBuddy was encrypting your stored logins, and then entering them via command line only when prompted, so it wasn't nearly as much of a risk as creating shortcuts with the password saved in plaintext.
---
This change doesn't stop you from still using LaunchBuddy to multibox (you can start up multiple launchers and enter the details manually), but it does mean you'll have to remember the account details for each individual account you want to log in, and you can't bypass the launcher, so it's definitely an annoying loss of time.
---
Excuse the fuck out of you? Joko? Minor? You're obviously insane. 
---
Hail his magnificence Joko....
---
"1k luck" as in 4 exotic luck or 1000 (4 stacks) of exotic luck?
---
Either I missed a feature but if I logged into a diff account I always had to type the password again, the client only remembered the pass for the account I logged in last with.
---
my life just got alot harder, i got 12 accounts i log into daily, instead of just double clicking i gotta input all 12 manually now, why??
---
Dusk is at 800g+ again :( feelsbadman, right when i got close, do people ever sell precursors on orders?
---
the only class you can play all content and be (sort of) best-in-slot for every **Raid** is mesmer:
---
[Support Chronomancer](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vhAQNAs+cnsIClfi9fCGoBUrhlVjqcDGhAoeZj2p9sJSiiA-jRSBQBD4EA0XdA4RrAR2fAAHEgJ+AAuiyPzoE8vq/QKgIWGB-e) is still better for 10man content than the renegade+firebrand comp 
---
[Power dps Chronomancer](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vhAQNAs9cnsICVqhloBGqBEgilVjqcDGhAoeZb2pFdLOjqA-jhRBABXt/o8DP9CUq+jZKBN+BAAwJBgUARsMC-e) is extremely strong and brings good CC as well as a taunt, some access to slow and most importantly: boon strip.
---
[Condition Mirage](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vhAQNAn/ansICNohVoB2LDMMjlXDDNAkTaClVgeTwxf/VAPgA-jxxHQBzT9nxpXAAPAgBq8LjKBBy+D06kAEAIB4maTxmCupb6mupb6mqNdT30NdT30NdT30NVKAdHtB-e) is best-in-slot condi dps for all condition-damage based encounters, on a very fun dps rotation. the only situation where a condi class outshines mirage is Dhuum, where Renegade is busted, but in that encounter power chrono is just as strong, especially when paired with good renegades, ~~if not stronger~~.
---
For **open world**, you will have with dps chronomancer, perma quickness and nearly permanent alacrity for yourself, paired with good CC, lots of damage and access to a lot of blocks/evades. for group content, you can also bring timewarp and provide 10 people with Quickness, which is overpowered even for those players who are proud of just pressing 1 until they get loot, since it makes you auto-attack faster.
---
For **Fractals** the support chronomancer build is still strong, however renegade+firebrand combo ends up providing better group dps than a chrono, while maintaining the boons. that applies mostly for CMs, since in the other T4s you may need the utilities that chrono brings, such as blinks, portals(even though you *should* have white mantle portal for high-end fracs) focus pulls, and the slow from timewarp.
---
DPS chrono is not in a best-in-slot position, but not in a bad spot either for fractals. the reason being power chrono doesn't have a quick burst of dps, but rather an insane ramp up damage with clones, that results in insanely high numbers - that doesn't necessarily goes well with high DPS groups since you should be mid-burst when other classes finish their bursts. that implies in either you wasting potential dps OR longer boss phases. this, again, applies mostly to CMs - but for the regular t4 fractals, you still have access to focus pulls, CCs, you can pre-stack some bonus alacrity with shield5(and swap it for another offhand once you're going in the fight).
---
And in **Dungeons**, you can solo all of them with a power chrono, once you're familiar with the class and dungeon mechanics. but nobody plays dungeons anyways, so it shouldn't matter :P
---
Greatsword auto scales up with range, and features a cripple and a knockback to keep foes away. Scepter is ranged. Staff is ranged. Offhand weapons are mostly used at range.
---
Sure, the end-game meta builds are melee, but that's not what you're talking about when selling the classes to new players.
---
Search the comments, it already showed up ;-)
---
So the problem is that we don't have their encryption algorithms. If we did, this would be easier to handle, and we could just pop our email and password directly into local.dat and be on our way.
---
Unless you mean allow this, but have the client change? That's not an option. The client already handles the email and password securely. The moment you hit login, all traces of plain text are gone. It's the "in between" that is the problem. That, and the fact that you are storing the info in plain text.
---
This really wasn't a bad decision for them or for anybody that plays the game. I will give one example of what might happen that might have made them make this decision. Someone's account is compromised, because they used an auto login, by RMT. They then use fraud to make several purchases on the account, possibly even using the player's saved CC information. Now Anet has to deal with this fraud and it costs them money to deal with that. Due to possible chargebacks. If it was the players saved CC then now they have to deal with their lost funds. That is a very big risk just for a convenience of using an auto login prompt.
---
This is just one example I can think of and it is not completely out of the realm of possibility something like that can happen.
---
http://www.gw2profits.com/basic_salvage.php
---
nope. currently 3s39c loss per ecto you buy and salvage and sell dust.  
---
the only profitable scenario is if you already have ecto and need to use dust to craft stuff - it's 1s20c cheaper per ecto to salvage the ecto vs. selling ecto and buying dust.
---
Is it finally Cantha time?
---
yes im a sucker; and worth mentioning that i already had dragon glider (the other rare)... but this shit is ridiculous; im not even mad that i didnt get any super rares or whatever; but black lion skins inside chests need their own god damn container because the bloating is obnoxious as fuck
---
Am I blind or is there no achievement that tracks daily achievements in this festival?
---
The answer is definitely yes. I've been playing for a few months and pvp is still hard to grasp for me.
---
Also, if you open path of fire look up an istan farming guide because that's an easy way to earn enough hold to buy/craft the gear you'll want!
---
I feel ya, I spent more than that, still didn't get it, and eventually used TWO golden keys to get it. /hug
---
My only crazy-theory would be that they did this at same time they released lunar, which has a daily per-acc profit. I'll let ppl decide if that has anything to do with it :P
---
Yes, I get they’re one time and only change appearance, I just want to confirm if it effects the actual item, or the slot.
---
Other MMOs I’ve played let you set a cosmetic look for each slot, overwriting anything you have, even if nothing is equipped.
---
You're right, they did it because the Lizard people who faked the moon landings told them to using their mind control because ANet weren't wearing their tin foil hats.
---
And you're ignoring the fact that the vast majority of people use a single password for everything.
---
2Fa won't help Bob if his GW2 password is the same as his email password and his 2Fa is via email.
---
I used my Level 80 Boost on a female Human Mesmer because the Cabalist dress and sleeves are so cute. However, I prefer the female Asura voice and animations.  Are there any race-change and name-change kits available in the Black Lion store?
---
I get stuck in them after they end as well and must log out to continue playing.
---
That shrine guardian outfit is going to be a real money maker.
---
But this way it's limited to 1 per week rather than a function of direct in game play time.  *shrug*  I'm not going to say it's perfect, it just is what it is.
---
But "remember password" doesn't work for the huge number of players who have multiple accounts. Why would Anet not just enable multiple account support in the launcher itself? I'm not asking them to store anything as plaintext, just to replace the terrible feature with a working one, rather than disable it altogether.
---
GW1 has a lower attack surface than GW2 and the gem store in GW2 provides more security concerns with the ability to input your CC information from within the game, something I don't think that GW1 has (though I could be wrong).
---
That also assumes that GW1's autologin uses a plain text password.... there's also just the simple "We forgot about that feature in legacy software" situation. There's not a single tech company I've worked at where forgetting about the legacy software hasn't been an issue.
---
And also tons of rare unid gear, so it really is worth going through the rooms instead of straight teleporting into green room.
---
There is a difference between magic exploding out or seeping out. That was my point. Aurene's death wouldn't result in an explosion of magic is the deaths of Elder Dragons don't.
---
And I would hardly call Glint and Joko on par. Glint was stayed to be "well on her way to becoming an Elder Dragon". So she had quite a bit of magic. Tequatl was the same with Tests to Rising when it canonically died - far more than the Claws of Jormag or The Shatterers.
---
Just saying this option is not only usable with a shortcut.  You could use a script/an executable to pass the user/password as an argument and having the script store it in a more secure way.
---
Core engineer has grenades and mortar kit, and rifle and pistol... Sure they aren't necessarily good or optimal at range but...
---
Fucking hell anet...
---
There's no slots. It just changes an item's appearance and shows the original skin of the item as a text in the tooltip. If you wear nothing you're naked with or without skins. Outfit may or may not require an armor piece  equipped (like chest for example) to work, but skins are tied to items.
---
Maybe requires a new map instance? Though I'd expect it to reset with new patch being available
---
Yes, it could have been done years ago. But nobody cared enough to do it.
---
Because something has been unsafe for years does not mean you should not fix it now.
---
You can still multibox, there are several [scripts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aiqee4/anet_disabled_auto_login/eeprtzk/) for it. Just don't store the passwords in plain text.
---
I'll take the sword skin. :o
---
Usually about 4 hours to get to Level 20 and about 45 minutes per level after that.
---
I just focus on events and kill yellow named mobs along with way for bonus exp. If I have friends on, I do Explorable dungeons as each one is worth a level.
---
race change no, name change yes 
---
And people.. this is why lootboxes became a thing.
---
What skin is that in the boots slot?
---
Sorry if I came out as if ESO did. But it is a wonder why haven't more considered such things sooner?
---
Ok that’s what I thought, thanks.
---
I request to see Exalted Shoulders with a [Sublime Mistforged Triumphant top](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sublime_Mistforged_Triumphant_Hero%27s_Raiment)
---
2FA does not go to your email.
---
Amen. I am so sick of the FP being full of art posts
---
110 iirc
---
Stop complaining and be happy ArenaNet even lets you have multiple accounts. They aren't required to spend development time to support any third-party addons.
---
The trick was to press the 'dive' button after jumping, then keep pressing the spacebar at 70% stamina. It would slowly take you higher, and higher, and higher, for many a year.
---
Exactly, you got it, dumb fuck.
---
Wasted 2k gold last time for new glider only to see that it has undyable red smoke animation. Never again.
---
Good if it discourages posts, that's the point. I don't come here to see some furry charr pic your GF painted or your terrible in game anime cosplay. I come here to discuss the game.
---
If it stops people from posting, good riddance. Then we can all be spared from having to look at that trash
---
Lol... that didn't take long.
---
"If it doesn't affect me, it's not a problem" is what you're saying. Good to know.
---
They just launched a patch, might be some server issues with the new version
---
Your account should have it automatically unlocked under dyes when you try to give something color.
---
I love that they keep giving us more exalted stuff (armor pieces and mounts) but what really bothers me with these shoulders is that the "wings" don't have the same physics as those on real exalted (you can easily test that with an exalted tonic) or the Luminate's Backplate. Real exalted wings or those on the Backpiece seem really "flexible" and move quickly with your movement while the ones from the new skin are really stiff and don't really react to your movement.
---
If you're using the tonic or the backpiece and you run in a straight line the wings are also a straight line, if you do that with the shoulders the wings keep their bent forms. 
---
I'll probably still waste dozens of keys trying to get them but damn, I'd prefer the real exalted physics.
---
Tegwen is resurrected and absorbs all of Aurene’s magic.  She is reunited with Carys and we join them in their adventures.
---
At some point "Bob" is going to have to be responsible for his own problems. Making everything harder on most people just to baby this "Bob" is not the way to go.
---
For as jacked as my norns are, they sure do have no ass whatsoever
---
wtf is this response what is so hard on adding the same autologin feature with parameters with arent cleartext?
---
there are enough ways to do it and a fairly simple to implement
---
Well I hope you find a solution that works.  In the meantime I've rigged my password manager to mostly handle the login after clearing the UN/PW fields in launchbuddy but its kind of an obnoxious cludge job.  its only been a day and I already miss my one click multibox login :(
---
Well gotta get these for my roaming rev and guardian. 
---
Ah yes have one complaint about your job means you should quit? Kids these days.
---
This doesn't exactly fit your request, but I'm sure with a bit of tinkering you could adapt it to your needs, plus it's a blast to play.  
---
If you're willing to level a thief,you try a zerker or partially zerker Daredevil with lots of sustain and staff with another weapon of your choice. I use it for quickly capping camps, but I've noticed it also destroys tanky builds that can't burst me down, is great for dodging obvious tells, and it out-sustains every other build I've ever seen just by attacking. I haven't been playing GW2 recently, so I can't give you a build, and I don't know if there have been any changes to traits I use, but it should still function.
---
it's sad people still use the downvote as "i don't like this!"
---
fwiw you are absolutely right, guardian has a lot of surviving and crutches like this create people that can't play their class
---
&gt; This decision is going to cost players a hell of alot of time now. This is a giant fuck you to players that have invested in multiple accounts. Put this feature back.
---
Simply wrong. See my other comment explaining how to make it work now (or other people's comments).
---
It's fun to see you attack anet like that and say something like this assuming there is no solution, and at the same time explain that people (like you) who know command line parameters necessarily understand a lot about computers.
---
Also, read [this](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/807538/#Comment_807538) before spitting stupid conspiracy theories ("attempt to hamstring multiple account owners" ... it just can't make sense)
---
\*\*laughs in self written account management program that does basically the same as your batch file\*\*
---
Axe is so much fun. Reason I switched to a mirage main once I started playing it. 2, 2, jaunt, 3 clones and good to go, time to spam auto, dodge and watch axes fly everywhere. Made Astralaria for my mirage in under a month after I started playing because of how much I loved it.
---
Same with the power build. Power mirage just isn't fun to me. Never really liked sword on mesmer. Greatsword you're just forced to use because it's the only real way you can tag enemies. Would be nice for Staff's projectile to get like a 100% speed buff because that's the one thing hurting it there. I even wouldn't mind a damage nerf if they just made it attack a lot faster. 
---
You can still totally use Launchbuddy to multibox. Just uncheck the "Use -autologin" box on the Account Manager window, then hit Launch Guild Wars 2 at the bottom of the screen as many times as it takes to open the number of instances you want. You'll have to log into each of them individually, but they'll all run.
---
This isnt cash money anet.
---
Enzo Fi.7490 
---
Thanks! you solved it.. it was actually "Flame Eye" lmao
---
Sorry but auto hot key? I think you're on the wrong message my guy. 
---
2 mins with tomes 
---
It was never necessary to have 2FA enabled to be able to use -autologin -password. Also a 2FA with 1 factor gone (in your scenario, the password being public) wouldn't be 2FA anymore, just good ol' 1 factor.
---
You are allowed to disagree.  Misunderstanding the nature of Terms of Service is likewise fair game.  Claiming something isn't an issue because there is a bigger issue is possible as well.
---
So finally, after 3 years we have some alternative to durability runes. Too bad that roaming is almost dead.
---
If they are going to remove -email and -password then they need to add the option of storing passwords for multiple accounts in the launcher. 
---
"hey some people using multiple accounts have individual, strong generated passwords for each of the accounts stored as shortcuts. Let's make them type out every one of them manually, or switch to using simple easy to compromise passwords instead!"
---
What genius at anet thought this was a smart idea? Now instead of someone needing to compromise my machine, they need to only compromise a throwaway password I share among low priority accounts. 
---
**IF THEY COMPRMISE MY MACHINE THEYVE GOT EVERYTHING ANYWAYS**
---
You've improved literally nothing security wise and only weakened strong system some of us had in place.
---
You know, if a hacker hacks your PC and has more than 90 iq he can just put a malware to save your keystrokes.
---
Same shit, just longer. Your change actually changes nothing. 
---
Considering Gaile Gray specifically clarified that is not an issue nor that it's done to persecute or punish multi boxing, but merely out of security reasons, you're free to have your own opinion. I'll go with what the Dev said, though.
---
Oh, arse. Sorry, too many threads going at once.
---
First DnT and now you....damn ANET
---
any plans to advertise that a bit? i think now would be the time
---
Whats the rarity on the shoulders?
---
"I'm sure I'll get it in the next one!"
---
Curious on the chance of success of playing the way you are talking about 
---
I posted in it a few minutes ago.
---
Every 20 seconds while in combat. 
---
Oh sorry I meant to say make a crying post complaining about having to do your job and break your own rules doing so while the post is complaining about people not following the rules. Nothing to see here apparently.
---
It's cosmetic
---
They'd just make the envelopes account-bound, or prevent sending more than 500g a week. Your theory makes doesn't make much sense to me, it doesn't stop people from logging in normally on alt accounts and ... as explained in other comments, you can still make it work by saving password for all accounts and have easy shortcuts just as before (just requires some setup time on first day).
---
However I'd really like to know more about this :
---
&gt; they even nerfed the lucky envelopes anyway
---
The one i really wanted...
---
That is a masterpiece. It is definitely on the same level as some of the concept artworks. 
---
Sure, but even then it would still be possible to safe user/password in your shortcut. 
---
The point isn't that you have ways to make it safe. The point is that there is an unsafe way. And more important, this unsafe way is(was) provided by Anet itself.
---
I'm not disagreeing with you, I use LB all the time.
---
Assuming this sticks, there are alternatives for LB to use. We've already talked about them to a certain extent before, but the workflow is going to get wonky.
---
I don't really see enough of them to be annoying. The balance posts that are just the same complaints over and over again are more spammy than the fashion.
---
The same way as before.
---
 joining meta runs, while running off meta build and pulling more dps. That's how life works
---
It's still one of the top mmorpgs today, only really topped by AAA company ones like ESO, WoW, FFXIV.
---
Entering with reddit name, please and thank you!
---
&gt;"putting your password as plain text in a command line where anything can read it is a REALLY BAD IDEA and teaches bad security habits."
---
No; anything on MY machine can read it. Not anything.
---
That's like saying :
---
&gt;"Keeping your bank statement in a file folder  in a drawer is a REALLY REALLY BAD IDEA because anyone who breaks into your home could go and read it! nothing to see here!"
---
Yeah genius, the plan is to not let untrusted people have access to your system or your home. If your machine is compromised then nothing is going to stop them from keylogging your text entry in the new launcher, or ripping the lock off a box containing your bank statements.
---
How can you speak with such authoritative tone when this simple concept eludes you?
---
I appreciate that she answered to clarify that it really is a dumb reason after over 6 years.
---
I mean shit, did nobody on the security team notice that before? If so, that's impressive.
---
whenever you give him 1k luck, he gives you  8 red festival lanterns which is 7s4c. because you can only give one at a time though, its pretty bad gold per hour. it comes out to around 42g per hour if you can stand just constantly clicking and hitting f on him.
---
Thanks, I'll follow those builds 
---
Thank you for this nice PSA.
---
I googled "arenanet 2fa". The first result for me is "Guild Wars 2 Account Security - Guild Wars 2 Support" and leads to the page I linked. Your link is second and doesn't mention email.
---
Blame anet, I guess?
---
Dumb kids. 
---
Ah... thank you again for explanation "how it works". :)
---
10 secs
---
I like the part where you intelligently backed up your opinion with logic
---
I am talking about https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/66631/command-line-options-changed
---
I completely yes fellow American gamer!  This big Arenanet conspiracy and not protection from hacking by completely safe and legal gold resellers such as www.praisechairmanxi.com.  We start petition now to reverse this patch,  please send name, email, and IP address so we can make angry gamer happy!
---
That's the axe I'm working towards too. But I'm sadly about 150 spirit shards short of the bloodstone item.
---
I suppose scepter/staff and GS are best for some of the Champs that can't be done in melee like Lava Wurm
---
Alright, if we're not going to use people's opinions, how are we going to determine whenever the joke was bad or not? What is going to be the "evidence"?
---
They just downvote it because it's not stated nicely, but who cares about downvotes anyway? Just attracts attention in a thread like this. 
---
Anyway, things like relying on Rune of Vampirism is how we get OP to come back in two weeks saying how he can't solo any elite mobs with his full Soldier Honor/Virtue/DH Greatsword/Staff build because Vampirism doesn't proc when you don't have anything to kill and the healing signet has too long of a cooldown but he has to run it for passive Condi cleanse. 
---
The starter ele helmet? Ouch!
---
PSA: you can double click your gear to prevent this issue.
---
&gt; arbitrary and random.
---
It's been like that for a long time, but it's difficult to bring up and discuss without getting targeted for "bias" because of personal involvement which is used to invalidate an opinion.
---
These are the kind of PSA special people need.
---
Congrats to all the winners! 
---
I've been using LB1.7 with -autologin disabled with some limited success since the patch. It's not the same, of course. As someone with 11 accounts that I use daily, I'm absolutely disgusted with Anet today. 
---
"a hell of a lot of time" like 3, seconds for 90% of people.
---
Thank you, this works at the moment
---
&gt;neko
---
No, the correct word would be a nekomimi . A neko is just a cat. I don't think I've ever seen that word appropriated in the way you mentioned to anything other than a cat, while nekomimi always is.   
---
Also pretty sure this a fox outfit, not a cat. So kitsunemimi. 
---
"Just have to see when it raises its head"
---
That would require my computer to actually load the Moa model before it dies lol.
---
"I know you have literally one interest"
---
That's *a bit too condescending*, is it not?
---
Related to the title, Anet doesn't really disabled auto login at all. 
---
You can still auto login just by activating the checkboxes in your launcher.
---
You can still do all that, now it will take slightly longer, hardly a crushing victory for "the man"
---
1. Store your strongly generated passwords in a keystore
---
1. Create macros to copy them into the login screen (once you've unlocked the keystore with a master password)
---
1. Enjoy both security and convenience
---
I keep a scepter on me for things like that to swap with axe if staff isn't getting the job done or I just feel like something different.
---
The only thing I really don't like about mesmer is all the ranged options are just okay. Nothing is incredible they're just good enough to get the job done. And unfortunately any new weapon will be bound to an elite spec so useless for mirage. I'd love to have like a mainhand pistol or even a bow with mirage as I can imagine some crazy ideas for them.
---
I want that outfit hat but ofc no. :o
---
I have no idea why they removed your thread or if you will even be able to see my comment.  I really enjoyed what you wrote &amp; I would like to read it again, is there a way !?
---
I love your program but this means I will have to switch back to my old trusty command line launch interface script where I simply type a number and it copies the appropriate local.dat into the client. It's not multi boxing but at least saves me the time of entering all that login info every single time. 
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.
---
It was a command line option, your view will be the view of the vast majority of the player base.
---
&gt; more annoying, the "start automatically" checkbox doesn't really work. It has a 5s timer, so you need to click "play" anyway.
---
It works as intended, you have to wait 5s obviously...
---
First off, I did not break any rule. Being a moderator gives me the ability to make announcement comments like this and that is within my authority. 
---
Secondly, I enjoy being a mod. It's annoying at times but I enjoy it. But when someone decides to report almost 80 posts for no legitimate reason it makes my job incredibly difficult to do because now I can't moderate the sub as a whole as I have to deal with all of these false reports. I do it because I volunteered to do it, but I also have the right to bitch about it and say quit doing it because it makes it impossible to really moderate when we have to deal with that. 
---
These shoulders..... how CLOSE is that to capes... ANET: tech is there.
---
How the fuck do you know it's a minority demand? I would like to see your numbers please. See how easy that is, idiot.
---
Oh. Didn't realize it was a different thread.
---
You catch up when others reach the cap.
---
Daily has a cap of 15K, shared with any points players may have gathered from monthly achievements before they were discontinued.
---
The yearly achievements have a cap of 1000 AP. If you miss a year, you still get other years after 20.
---
Yeah, fixing security leaks, how could they!
---
Gotta say, I'm pretty disappointed if this is the final sink they have for luck.
---
Wow! That’s quality art!
---

I think if I were you I would start with PVP.. I never learned more about the class/classes until I played PVP. Just join in on the unranked games take some time to review traits/ skills so you can know how they work. With out a doubt there are many videos on YouTube that will go over improving your class and rotations in PVP for added knowledge. 
---
*FYI don’t be surprised by angry people in PVP, just focus on improving*
---
Oh, another one who seems to love to share his account with everyone. 
---
Her account was taken over through support tickets though. Still security, but a human based vector, not a technical one 
---
I continually get the error saying "the game client lost its connection to the server".  I get that about every 45 minutes.  I have 100 Mbps fiber and acer gaming laptop so it shouldn't be equipment related.  I just picked up the game again this week, and this has been a problem the whole time.  Any thoughts on what could be the cause?
---
Security &gt; convinience.
---
Literally unplayable since last night for me. Over 2k ping.
---
The client encrypt your account data, the shortcut parameters are plain text.
---
Well, it's just... ... *really* uncommon.
---
Since we have mounts, I'll take Pack runes and the 125 precision bonus for PVE.
---
Current Roaming META (assuming that enemy is equal skill level):
---
**Godtier: Condi Mirage** \- if you are above average skill player you can literally fight anyone and never loose (even when outnumbered!). However you may also not be able to finish off other skilled players who play builds with great condi management like Soulbeast.
---
**A+: Power Mirage, Soulbeast** (both Sic'em PewPew Kiter and Axe Boonbeast) - win versus everyone but tier above.
---
**A-: Magebane Tetherbreaker** \- great mobile duelist that loose to tiers above only. Not so good for outnumbered fights.
---
**Holosmith** \- not as good duelist as classes above but still very effective in typical smallscale scenarios.
---
**Power Herald** \- while loosing to equally skilled A+ builds, it completely destroys a little less skillful players and is probably the best +1 class atm. However it is essence of high risk-high reward gameplay, where one skill badly casted or just not the best positioning can make you dead instantly. 
---
​
---
Notable: Thief/DD/Deadeye - while it fits smallscale roaming perfectly with his overall low risk-high reward gameplay and unmatched capability to escape and reset fights endlessly, practically it is easier (especially with recent cheesy 'spin to win' elite change) but less rewarding version of Power Mirage.
---
All of mentioned builds you can find well described and explained on metabattle.
---
sorry to ask but is there a workaround for that? can launchbuddy still handle logins? 
---
Why did you even make leggy armour if you're not stat swapping?
---
I mix my stats and runes on mesmer a couple times a day.
---
and its only limited to LNY . .. Wouldn't be so bad if we could give him a stack at a time or something. Would rather they just increase the mf cap or use luck in a recipe or something like luck sigils or making fireworks.
---
It's so ugly i need this ! XD 
---
Tomorow it's mine ! My new precious. *-*
---
It's not in a lootbox, it's a rare bonus to the guaranteed gems for Black Lion Statuette + seasonal gift bag + 2 surprise goodies exchange !
---
Command lines ARE approved tools... tools set up BY Anet.
---
God why do you even bother commenting. 
---
They did say that they were developing the tech to release LW episodes much quicker. 
---
They obviously haven't but that to use yet, so maybe we'll see very quick LWS5 releases. 
---
My hope is that we'll quickly get 4-5 episodes of Season 5 then an expansion in the fall/late 2019. They did also say that they were looking to make cheaper and smaller expansions, so it wouldn't make much sense to have expansion 3 take longer to develop than PoF.
---
Just my high-hoped thoughts on the matter. GW2 seriously needs an expansion right now.
---
First World Problems
---
Revenant is not even in there?
---
To store your account data as plain text in a file that is related to these data is a huge security risk. 
---
It's like wearing a tshirt with your credit card number on it.
---
oh i have done this. i should also note im often playing at offpeak hours sooo that makes it more likely ill not have a lot of help.
---
I heard this argument like a billion times. If you are just starting out to raid and you expect people to let you join an [X amount] LI run simply because you feel like it it is pretty normal to get denied. You have to start raiding the same everyone else did : Join a training guild -&gt; get some experience ( don't expect to clear all wings on your 1st week it is natural ) -&gt; keep practicing withing your guild while you farm those juicy LIs and then you can go pug if you feel like it.
---
Expecting people to allow you to join an experienced group without any experience is the equivalent of expecting to land a 7 figure salary job that requires a lot of degrees , years of experience and whatnot after you finish high school. It just does not work like this.  
---
Well it would have to be a targeted attack on your local machine for a start. Second, despite being able to save a card to your account you have to enter the security code on the back of the card each time. Third, all except the last four digits are concealed.
---
If I am doing a directed attack on your account through your local machine then you've got larger issues ahead of you.
---
I hope this is now a yearly thing because it will give me a reason to save my luck every year
---
You still can login via doubleclick, you just will need to doubleclick 12 different shortcuts, that's it....
---
Consider the information here is stored locally... it would be a targeted attack.
---
If you can not be bothered looking up a few things outside the game that the community has created to help new players maybe raids simply are not for you.
---
That pig is so meta
---
would anyone else love it if u/SrGrafo made a comic series of Gw2
---
The option is arleady there.
---
Well that's just [sad](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/470/145/828.gif)
---
Fooo Yooooou
---
Spend far more time clicking the reward popups &gt;&lt;
---
I'm in Australia mate. You don't play more off hours than I do. There's usually someone around. I usually get help. It requires two things. A bit of patience and knowing where people are at given times. 
---
For example I never go to an old zone the first days a new zone comes out, or the first days of a festival.
---
People are more upset about hurting multiboxing, than with other bigger issues with game that recently pile up.
---
Just a reminder that yours extra 3 or four account are still lessimportant that one new player who stays in GW2 for longer. Too lazy for more effort? Then don't multibox, problem solve. 
---
Ther are much bigger issues. 
---
Yes, security issues. 
---
I’ve never used the auto login anyway. Can someone explain why so many people are upset? What does it matter if you have to click a couple more times to login in?
---
There already are enough ways...
---
Loving the wvw updates!
---
Good. Fox and Wolfgirls are superior 😤
---
Yep. Hi there. o/ I confirm i'll set the place around 8:00pm utc next week-end. ;-) Just like every saturday and every sunday. 
---
Glad you'll join us.
---
So far, we've had three success and unfortunately a very frustrating failure. Last zealot (phase 2) had 2% life and... Boom. XD 
---
Just a reminder: It's a [Eu] server community event. I hope our [NA] fellows will find a weekly lead soon. 
---
See you &lt;3
---
You don't need to hop right into a match. You can spend as much time as you want in the Heart of the Mists (PvP Lobby) where you can freely play around with, test, and learn all about everything that is unlocked at your own pace. 
---
Just use the gw2 launcher? Your password is encrypted there.
---
They just look like fat humans with lion heads. I don't see any chairs either, yet two appear to be sitting.
---
This was exactly my point of view until I tried Mirage. Give it a try.
---
Lucky tp player can make 1k gold in a hour 
---
Probably...
---
I can only store 1 password in there
---
It's almost like wolf/fox ears have the same general aesthetic because *they're ears from the same animal.*
---
[I mean, at least GW2's ears have jewelry.](https://i.imgur.com/XSctqoh.jpg)
---
I didn't know Anet was controlled by EA
---
FYI that is a horrible method. Just use symlinks and you don’t need multiple windows accounts. 
---
The idea of creating 37 windows accounts for a game is insane to me. &gt;.&gt;
---
"same weakling since the start of guild wars 2"
---
Speak for yourself man I'm a freaking *Firebrands* now.
---
I'm not sure what ports GW2 uses aside from 80, but are they blocked on your router?
---
I can't believe this game keeps delivering drama every once in a while... A really amazing game that went to hell thanks to some ridiculous agenda and bad decision making from the developers/game director...
---
But the target is the gw2 shortcut, not a certain person. 
---
Accounts plural, not singular. 
---
Oh my
---
Good idea, will investigate further.
---
Farm my full home instance, craft daily ascended mats, login rewards, etc.
---
Goodness. Don't use AutoHotKey for what Keepass was designed for. https://keepass.info/ and your logins are stored securely in an encrypted DB with auto-completion based on window name with the ability to allow you to select from multiple logins in cases where you have more than one.
---
So for example, you could have LoginA, LoginB, LoginC for Guild Wars 2, you setup a Keepass entry for each login with the appropriate password for each, then you tie those logins to the Guild Wars 2 login window so Keepass knows that those logins are bound to that program and when you press whatever your Auto-Completion keystroke is, it'll pop open a dialog to allow you to choose which account it should enter from among LoginA, LoginB, or LoginC (it will only suggest logins that you've tied to that window) and then it will fill in the login automatically and submit it. It can do this for everything on your computer so you need only know the password to decrypt your database and you're good to go.
---
I think I followed your instructions correctly, but it prompts me for a password in the cmd?
---
`Attempting to start C:\Program Files (x86)\Guild Wars 2 - B\Gw2-64.exe as user "DESKTOP-HO5UTJO\MYNAME" ...
---
Enter the password for MYNAME:`
---
**Easy Solution:** Create a batch file in the GW2 executable's folder with these 4 lines, and the number incremented by one for each (I've shown with 2 examples for clarity). The first time you run this, it will create a folder \\a#\\ and a new local.dat. Type your name and password, ensure they are set to save, then close and move on to A2, A3, etc..
---
There is no need to copy local.dat files around, it keeps one for each account.
---
The only remaining downside is it takes a few clicks longer to get through the launcher screen - but your names and passwords will be saved for each!
---
I keep a list of which A# is associated with which account, but it's not really necessary since you see the email address for the login on each.
---
`setlocal`
---
`set userprofile=%appdata%\Guild Wars 2\a1`
---
`Gw2.exe 1`
---
`pause`
---
`set userprofile=%appdata%\Guild Wars 2\a2`
---
`Gw2.exe 2`
---
Have been using GW2Launcher for months
---
Can confirm it works just fine after the patch, just have to manually log in.
---
The little bouncy chest that appear a above your minimap when you complete most non-core events.
---
It's a good thing the animation on the tentacles is so rigid that it looks bad. No loss.
---
Uh? Do you expose your personal files to the world? Because that's the only realm in which these two situations are in any way equivalent. If the file is on your machine and never leaves it, it is fundamentally the same as typing it in to gw2. In fact, it'd be more "dangerous" to type it into gw2 if you had a keylogger because if you're ripping it out of a text file, you aren't typing it.
---
As noted, this GWlauncher is an adequate replacement until (if) Launchbuddy is modified.
---
https://github.com/Healix/Gw2Launcher
---
Another local.dat file, another account. 
---
Read the other comments, it's mentioned here. Some people even wrote the whole batch file on their comment. It's almost just copy and paste.
---
Saying the class focuses on range when it doesn’t isn’t an issue of introducing too many complexities early on. It just gives people the wrong idea about a class. People aren’t suggesting a description of the way missile cones work be included.
---
"you can do it but we won't make it easy for you anymore."
---
Time and effort ?
---
One squad, full of course = 15 minutes of playing, maybe twenty and it's done. For a daily mosaic.
---
Remind me how much people/squads and how many time of waiting/opening chests are needed for doing HoT meta ? 
---
People this it's hard but no, it's not. ;-)
---
Excuse me a second whilst I go chuck myself into a wood chipper.
---
thats how i did it before, how do i continue doing that now with the -user and- pass disabled? do i have to shortcut something else now?
---
"multiple accounts" wouldn't make any sense in singular...
---
Like I said, the option is already there.
---
Logging into one account is fine.
---
Now, logging into 10, 20, 30, 40 accounts? Not so much.
---
Guess we have different interpretations then. I don't really see how the post was related to the topic. Nor do I see the value in even posting it since whoever did it was probably done at that point. And even if they werent then do you really think posting asking them to stop would make them? No wonder the queue is so long if you're wasting time like this.
---
