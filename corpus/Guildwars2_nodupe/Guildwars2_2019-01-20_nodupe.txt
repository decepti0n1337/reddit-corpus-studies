It would, indeed.

Not to mention... She DID NOT crystallize. It's been established and that same episode made it an emphasis that her species when dead crystallize. Glint did it, Vlast did it shortly before exploding but Aurene didn't. Only parts of her that were impaled were branded but the rest of her was fleshy.
---
To add on that - it stays true to all serialized stories. The more we speculate the more likely it is for someone to guess the ending. I recall that a lot of important plot points in Game of Thrones were already predicted. But they certainly got lost in prediction sea.
---
Also palawadan has a hard limit of 30 chests per account per meta. Every chest you were able to open will refill once the meta is finished successfully, but if you reached the cap they will all disappear.
---
Well, there's still stuff like legendary armor and weapons, masteries, etc.

Yeah same, I only have a few songs where I do a double octave swap and most of those allow me to take a little time to make sure I'm on the right octave for the notes I'm playing.  Single octave swaps still feel fine to me, gw2 has always had some play lag for me so perfect mechanical macro style playing has never been an option for me, so maybe I just play slower than other people.
---
I tried the normal harp and didn't notice much of a difference :/
---
* I've done successful Great Halls, then come back for the next one and found all the chests still open when they spawn (which they do in standard numbers). So what's the rule for when they refill so I'm not wasting time?
---
* The Palawadan chests have also spawned in already open when I go back for another meta. Seems to be somehow related to reset, but not entirely as I have come back after reset and still had opened chests.
---
I'm not I'd be with people who are annoyed if they came out and said raid wings will release 6 times a year as thats them promising it. They didn't promise 6 wings a year they hoped for this meaning it could happen it might not. The community should have realized  this meant nothing is set and if we don't get 6 a year its fine Anet didn't promise this. This wasn't an announcement it was a comment on the twitchcon raids guild chat from 2015. Rubi asked "how many raids will be released a year" and a dev said "we hope to release 6 wings a year" this was an aim a hope but this community takes it as set in stone thats my problem.
---
This! There are plenty of times were I thought my chest just disappeared until I learned it was actually my account capping on its chest limit. 
---
Just like support tickets should take over a week to go through LUL
---
I think the issue was that they shoehorned all the budget into the story. The map is an absolute blast, but it just lacks purpose like you said. It didn't help they also made it almost as huge as a core map.

Today it gave me a plate to a room in already finished before. So re did that one quickly. Got a plate to the yellow room that I haven't done where i got the final green one. In total, I had to run through 5 rooms before I got the green one
---
Yes, F2P accounts can't change worlds until full game purchase; if you get the game you have one transfer between world of both regions for free, any further change requires transfer fee paid in gemstore gems currency and amount depends on WvW population of the chosen world.
---
Free to play accounts are limited in features to keep gold sellers and other alike people away from the game and to make those who are really interested in game purchase it (tho, some people are still enjoying F2P variant as it's still playable). F2P accounts with limitations introduced in 2015 are still doing the job well - gold sellers are barely visible in map chat.

Check Documents folder on your drive - maybe you have some screenshots there which may help you recall character name. I'm not sure if support accepts bank transaction summary but you can still try with that if you manage to get this info from your bank

The guy you are replying to is actually right, and you’re wrong. My direct bank payments take 3-5 business days to complete, much like transferring money to PayPal from my bank takes. However, PayPal does sometimes preapprove payments, which will come out of my bank in 3-5 business days. Canada btw

Malaysia here. Mudfish used to make a difference for me (slightly lower ping, but more stable connection). Nowadays it doesn’t do much so I just use it as regular VPN.

200-300 is fine. I play CMs, raids and ranked PvP at 350ms. It’s more important to not have unstable connection because a consistent high ping is easy to compensate.

Holosmith is an absolute glass cannon, great damage and CC capabilities but he's extremely frail. Not an issue in Raids since u have druids backing u up. In open world though,  u might struggle if there's no support.

Thats true in 2 scenarios : you have 1 free tranfer if you upgrade from a free to play account to a complete one with expansions. Also, you can always have a free tranfer if you dont have any toon on the account. Note that f2p accounts cant make any transfers

I never had problems with Great hall not spawning chests unless I didnt participate in events, are you sure you're hitting the bosses and the gates and such?
---
I think the first three chests are bugged in Palawadan and appear to be open when the meta starts, they sometimes get fixed when the post meta reset happens, but it seems random. You should still be able to hit the cap with the remaining chests.
---
May have been a bug at the time but the very first day the map came out I got the plates to all 6 rooms in one trip, and for the achievement for visiting all 6 because I noticed the achieve popup.  Since then only 4 rooms at a time.
---
I feel really silly for not actually trying this first...  
---
Thank you!
---
At least the Hero panel opens to the Achievements tab now. But I would rather it *not* open to the page/achievement category I left it on.
---
Same here, I got one once while doing nothing but opening a chest in the room. I thought you have to have the last hit to get the plate, so I stayed out of the fight to let other people get theirs first, graveling dies and there lies the plate...

Someone else posted an alternative solution that is easier to do on a mesmer.
---
1. You spawn a portal on one of the cursed chests.
---
2. Go to the end chest, spawn the other half of the portal.
---
3. F5 for Continuum Split.
---
4. Go through the portal, grab the chest.
---
5. Continuum Split returns you to your starting location when it ends.

....But it *is* on the wiki page for each stat that has a limit.

Discretize should be coming out with an updated chrono build for fractals preeeetty soon. Until then: Fractals are a completely separate can of worms since you can’t rely on SoI from a second chrono, so you need to upkeep boons yourself. IIRC you should be running double wells w/ TW (when possible) at 100% boon duration - 15% BD comes from 150AR with fractal pots, so you can just aim for 85% BD from your gear (Diviner’s, pack runes, sigil of concentration if needed, power food/utility).
---
Part of the reason for 100% boon duration is that for most people, fractal fights tend to be messy enough that people will inevitably miss your ToT / wells / etc. If you’re running with a good static or can phase bosses fast enough, you may be able to get away with less boon duration.
---
Yeah totally did, 400 not k I don't know how that happened :'D Thanks.

Wow 14 seems like a lot. Once seems daunting enough. I guess you get good at it after the first few times. I’m not worried about doing it as quickly as possible. Kind of enjoy running around and doing completion. Was just wondering how much more inefficient it was.

I did bring this up in my first post, albeit briefly. Due to the addition of magic, as well as female fights, what is historically accurate wouldn't really make complete sense in a fantasy setting. So it would make more sense to reduce physical functionality for aesthetics, if there's some non-obvious defenses to them (such as enchantments).

Though I wouldn't go so far as to say that enchanted clothing is better than metal armor.

Any tips or videos for how to survive Living World S2 and on? Finally got to level 80, cleared the original story. Now Im on Season 2 and I'm having significantly more trouble now. I'm working on the Firebrand and have full exotic gear, mostly zerker, but a few other pieces too in order to have better suitability since heavy armor doesnt let me dodge very often. I'm following the open world firebrand build on metabuilds but still having some trouble.
---
I'm sure you already know the answer to this question BY NOW but I just saw this and it felt right to respond. 
---
Your race will decide where you character starts. Along with a set of race specific abilities. So you got your own personal story starting out until you get to the Main Story Scenarios. Even though your race spawn area is different it doesn't stop other players from going to Hoelbrek or The Grove to hang out, visit, or do quests though.

---
What are your thoughts about the ending? 
---
General advice because I'm not sure where your problem lies (Are you doing the expansions with a squishy profession clad in whatever gear the mobs dropped?)
---
1. Look up the core profession builds on Meta Battle. Use it as a basic guide that shows you synergies in your profession. (You can worry about following the meta to the letter when you're doing content where it matters.)
---
2. Get a set of exotic gear for whatever build you're using. There are budget versions of the meta gear so it shouldn't take you long if you're relying on daily login rewards for your gold.
---
3. The HoT maps always have hero point/ mastery trains led by a friendly commander on the regular. It looks like you don't have it.(?) I have seen a single train in PoF and there weren't many people so HoT will be your best bet to continue progression. 
---
4. Make an alt with one of the hardier professions and get your "Been There, Done That" with them instead. The more you fight mobs the better you get at recognizing their attacks and the better you get at avoiding them. Keep the wiki open as you proceed so you can hunt down the insights.
---
5. Reroll if it isn't working for you. Something will eventually click.
---
Ele's tornado elite also throws cow at the enemy .  
---
Hit me up in game, if you're on a US server. I can help. Vayne.8563
---
With the zerker gear are you using the quickness firebrand build? Don't use one of the condi ones. You might have better luck with the base guardian open world build. I'd recommend greatsword and sword+focus, you can get a lot of blind plus the triple aegis on the focus skill.
---
HoT is notoriously difficult though. You'll die a lot, but if you push through and get to PoF it's a lot easier.

You access living story episodes by getting online when it is the newest episode available.

If not, you have to purchase the living story package in the gem store

no, you can only access the map that fits the episode that you've bought.

I'm just gonna bet that Aurene pops out from Caithe like a Chestburster or she already moved her mind to the Commander, and there will be a new Bond which is basically Commander and Aurene's combined resonance skill thingywut.

I think part of the dragon talk “that no one seem to remember” it seem the only way for her ascension is to be branded. At least that’s what I think, and the only reason they were not told as the might stop it from happening or don’t want it to happen.
---
She will break out and be stronger then ever.
---
The problem is on NA side and has persisted for awhile because no new instance of the map has been created since the event bugged out.
---
I’m assuming OP is on NA. I’m also on NA and noticed everyone in the map mentioning the same issue. Event bugged out, can’t get to the POI, and no new instance of the map is being created.
---
&gt;Training Run
---
In this case, you're the asshole.
---
Haha was gonna post it there but theyd have no idea what I was talking about
---
Each episode purchased corresponds to one map.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I think comparing your own dps to theirs was the wrong way to go about it but it’s better than min numbingly smacking the boss without getting anywhere.
---
I don't even think so. I'd take it as a "it's clearly possible to do damage here", than a "I'm better than you."
---
And how did your training runs with dps who do 5-7k go?
---
Pick one of the ones with no nose.
---
Said everything I was going to pretty much.
---
The other thing to remember is a training run doesn't necessarily have to end in a kill to succeed. Dps can be trained on a golem, but if the training taught everyone the mechanics of Sloth then it wasn't a failure.
---
Male asura for commanding but not calm or rough.
---
So he was having or showing a feeling of patronizing superiority, then?
---
It's only condescending if he's being patronizing, which his tone from earlier made it clear he wasn't. How would you tell the group how they're doing on dps then?
---
 I do think it’s more likely to be taken as “you’re doing bad, I’m doing good” but agree to disagree.
---
Though I do think it still sends the wrong message. It’s almost as if saying “you need to aim for these numbers or you aren’t doing good enough” which is demoralising for new raiders. You need to positively reinforce dps improvements they make and continually help them improve. Doing it as such also provides intrinsic motivation to the raiders and is more likely to keep them playing happily. 
---
Can I get one for my home instance? Better yet, can we get real ones with the next Expansion Collector Gold Edition or something?
---
I suppose it then also matters what role OP has in the group.
---
If they are the commander or one the more experienced players who is helping out a friend or etc. then I do believe it is their responsibility to do something along the lines of what I said.
---
However if they are just someone who joined the group from lfg and has no other connection to the people in this training run then I agree with you completely. It’s not their job and they most likely won’t see the players again.
---
Which is why in every group/guild, at least imho, there needs to be that one "asshole" pointing these things out. It's best if that isn't the commander, but the right hand man, preferrably on dps. 
---
Depends on your objectives I reckon:
---
A) If it was a training run and the goal was for people to be familiar with mechanics, sounds like you achieved that pretty handily
---
B) Training runs don’t guarantee kills (if you got the kill it kinda is icing on the cake but defeats the purpose of training in the first place). More wipes = more chances of practicing. 
---
C) As someone has highlighted before, golem practices would have been helpful if people were hitting 5k and getting less than a support class. No point trying to learn your rotation whilst dealing with mechanics - it’s much more efficient to run it under a low pressure environment.
---
Calling people out on low DPS is factual. Making snide remarks or making personal attacks wouldn’t be (which in this case you didn’t do). So I would think you weren’t wrong.
---
One thing you can do is look in /r/guildrecruitment or make a post yourself. I see WvW guilds posting in there on occasion. 
---
If you make a post make sure to include your region (NA/EU) and homeworld (or willingness to transfer). 
---
Best of luck to ya mate!

Generally, no. Note that some story instances scale for achievements. For example, one instance where you have to rescue all pact members to get the achievement, there are more pact members for more players.

So like raids? I've seen the result when "nobody feels targeted". I was in a wvw guild for 2 years that honestly tried to get everyone to be better, and no one ever got called out as a rule. Those people who were bad, stayed bad and never left and the guild continued to never improve because of that. 
---
If no one feels like they have any reason to be blamed they won't feel any responsibility to improve.
---
If DPS is the reason you weren't killing the boss and you pointed it out without attacking then you were 100% in the right.  I've seen waaaay too many "happy feel good" groups where, no matter how bad the people are, the trainer or commander just tells them "keep it up" or "you are doing great!" and guess what?  Those players who are there to learn the boss or learn to raid won't learn anything if they are told everything they are doing is great and their DPS is fine.  Do you have to be an asshole and tell them they are trash or what not?  No.  But don't also baby them either.  If people get offended because you pointed out the reason the boss wasn't dying was their low DPS then they really need to wake up.
---
I love guild wars, I wanna play guild wars; but every time I log in, I cant figure out what to do. I've done all the story content up to "All or Nothing". At tier 3 fractals and working on learning raids. Besides map completion what else is there to do? Should I dig deeper in the map completion game? What do you do for fun in GW2 aside from pvp?
---
I'm surprised its been so borked since the salvaging runes/sigil update and nothing's been done about it

[From WvW](https://imgur.com/a/gfDptT5)
---
If you are totally new to WvW then ask in mapchat if there is a server guild. Some servers still have this and it is a good point to start at. How ever getting in to WvW is something that you need to do on your own. A lot of players think that WvW is a day care center were they are joining and entilted to have some fun that others provides for them. Those others are also players like you and me and no one should ever join WvW feeling they should be entertained you entertain your self and if someone tags up and you want to be a part of a zerg you bring a character that is suited for that with a build suited for zergs you join TS/Discord and you follow what the com say. 
---
If you want to roam about on your own or with people it is really the same thing. You adjust your build to work for that. Like for example mapchat call out 5 people on NC and you and two others run there to save it. You run in and get instant killed because you did not think the fight through and then you are dead on the ground not respawning whilst the two now try to fight 5, then you again are useless. 
---
But if you do adjust, if you do follow the calls on map chat or call them self and ask for backup or if you join a squad and do your best to support your zerg then people will notice you and you will notice people. You will learn what kind of players you want to play with. You will learn what guilds there are on your server and how they work as a guild and as a pug comander if they tag up. You will also learn about WvW and why people shout at you because you pulled the tactivators or took supplies or why you stand on the wall hugging siege instead of jumping down and help your fellow players.
---
All that is a process that you need to do. And if you do you will become one of the people on the server that the other WvW players appreciate. Unlike those that logs in and cry in chat that there are no tag and can we do daily keep please bla bla bla.
---
I realize that what i wrote can sound harsh, it is not my intention, it is just that if you want to get in to WvW you need to dedicate your self to it and find the people who do the things you would like to do and watch and learn and ask questions and you will be included :)
---
Or a charr, enter fashion wars hard mode.
---
What kind of gear do you have? Exotic (orange) gear is better. But also what kind of stats do you run? And the build is it something that is helping you? Are you playing actively or standing at one spot hammering the keyboard. Dodges, blinks, blinds, blocks, interrupts, any sort of cc (things like daze, stun, fear and so on) to break break bars and so on. 
---
It is a lot ot take in but when you sorted your gear and your build out you will have to think about what the mobs do and what you can do to stop them. 
---
no, its more direct damage against burning foes
---
And you'll mostly have to get used to that, because they've abandoned the concept of branching storylines. 
---
Half of the times it takes forever to load what i want to buy. Sometimes if i don't pay attention i loose gold over it because it sell for the cost of it rather then what is listed. 
---
Yesterday something even more weird happen i loaded in but i could not use the trading post or the gemstore. There was simply nothing to click that reacted. It vannished after about 10 min but still this little things was never a thing before but now it is and i would really like to have a coment from A-Net telling us why it is like that and if they can do something about it or if it just gonna be like this.
---
I don't think you were being an asshole, having good DPS is part of the mechanism if you play DPS role
---
Male sylvari at any point. I also like the asura male but if i have to choose best voice between them i would pick male sylvari. 
---
Funny how the game looked better in the start than it do now.
---
They lost all the good devs to amazon it seems like.
---
About the "Aurene left us alone", look at the camera, she looked at us and wait for our "yes" (look the camera movement) to check Kralka.
---
I hope they delete their browser history soon.
---
There was 9 added to the game a while back and are placed in core tyria to commun with. 
---
This list will show you were to find them. It is the 9 first. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mastery_Insight 
---
After that it is achivements and some are super easy others take more time but here is the list for that,

---
no youre right, if people are upset at the simple truth that their dps is really bad then, they either get better, get carried, or stay where they're at
---
LIikely to be a some system error. Contact support and you will get it fixed. 
---
You're not an asshole. But that should be the comm's job to point it out (were you ?). I have made some beginner trainings where the comm asked for the group to do a quick golem together to check DPS, and fix builds/rotations.
---
Mesmer’s two elite specs are Chronomancer and Mirage. Thief has Daredevil and Deadeye. 
---
Condition damage is damage done through conditions such as burning, bleeding, poison, confusion, and torment. Condition DPS specs scale damage through the condition damage and expertise stats (condition duration). 
---
Daredevil gains a third evade bar and a special dodge. Power daredevil runs staff and their steal skill has special abilities vs raid bosses.
---
Deadeye replaces steal with mark and specialized more in steal attacks. They also gain access to rifle and that is a build option but usually they run dagger/dagger and use the #5 skill to stealth and backstab the marked target for high single target damage.
---
It might honestly just be simply that I've always dealt with a good amount of play lag, especially on heavily populated maps like HotM, DR or LA, so that I didn't notice a little more.  It's pretty easy to compensate for most of the time, playing a little slower, being a bit more deliberate with certain sliding chords etc, but it seems like you're not the only one to have noticed it so I guess there's something to it.  I remember they've notably improved the performance of the harp and instruments before, and oh god, do you guys remember how slow the Choir Bell used to play?  So they clearly do have some way of improving play lag.
---
More often than not this is the no 1 issue.
---
It just takes practice :)  A lot of people appreciate hand playing, too, and they'll stop and say nice things even if what you're playing is something simple.  I feel the same way about macro players sometimes, for a while there people wouldn't even stop to listen to my hand playing, but I've found some people still appreciate the effort that goes in to a human actually making music, even if it's virtual.
---
Btw, I have [some practice songs on my channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciH8vc-5-XY&amp;list=PL9rZiHENY1UgLoMYhG_GVwNcLu-uGA96e) if you want to look :)

It's...it's not here. Just a broken piece! Those wretched graveling scavengers must've -

---
Usually I like simple look and despise flashy things, but this character is fantastic. Mostly because it's not just throwing sparkly random stuff at your character. It's a perfect combination of different gear that fits well together. Good job 
---
The honest reply it's pretty simple, they dont really care about that unless it's affect their income directly or become a stagnant plague to the point of creating negative publicity outside of the community; and it's valid for both pvp and wvw.
---
You have a new player asking for proper equippment for dungeons. 
---
You can tell him to spend 73g on leveling 3 crafting disciplines (not even counting the amount of time buying everything from the guide and crafting step by step) and then being timegated by several account-bound requirements (exalted lore etc.) to spend another 68g to get viper's gear in order to be suboptimally geared for the content he wants to do. 
---
Or you spend just spend 12g on the armor (with okayish runes), 15g on the accessories and another 15g on the weapons with proper sigils. Worst case 42g (instabuy everything) without any timegate and almost perfectly geared for dungeons.
---
If you can catch the hacker on a video that very clearly shows he is hacking (like flying, teleporting around, moving under the map and so on) then add that in a mail together with the account name (block the person and you will get him on your block list were you can see both account name and his ingame name that he was using to hack on. Add as much info as you can that you think will help them investigate and send it to exploits@arena.net.
---
This mail is for cases were you know for a certain that it is hacking and not just lag or lacking of knowledge how you can use your character without hacking. It is not for cases were you are mad or somone insulted you or the like, just game breaking cases.
---
You will never get a respons to your mail but i have seen quite frequiently that the hacker vannish for a long period of time, others have told me the person said he was banned and in some cases i been watching Arena Net being on the server checking the player and then bam it is gone. It can take a while though, so if nothing happens keep on reporting them for botting rather then harssment if they hack. If you get more proof or better videos then use the mail again. 
---
&gt; nothing's been done about it
---
Probably because its impossible. Once they designed the base game most systems(TP) are probably a nightmare(if at all) to change. 
---
We had a PLAN
---
So then... she’s COCOON’D
---
People just can't handle the truth sorry to say, like it's upsetting to learn a negative truth but it's necessary to better improve yourself.
---
Ive been told warrior gets stale. Do you guys think this is true? I only have time to main 1 class thanks to college so I have to decide between warrior or elementalist. All im looking for is to have a fun time in open world/meta events killing stuff with ease. 
---
Join WvW on your server and ask in /t for the TS or Discord they are using.
---
Damnit, requires 18 HoM points for leggings :(
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't the Mesmer one have some skills which don't appear in the final game?
---
I seem to recall that it presents a mechanic - the Mesmer creates clones, and can teleport between them, like they "jump" between one clone and another, switching which is the clone and which is the Mesmer. As far as I'm aware, that isn't possible in the final game.
---
Did any of the others have mechanics that didn't survive to the launch?
---
When was this? Can you still craft minstrel, get the musical instrument, and then e.g. sell legendary on tp? 
---
Well, not calling it out wont help either. New players in raid see buffed (25 might, quickness, fury etc.) DPS for the first time.  Most of the times they won't be using arc either. 
---
So if you go with example 1 you will have 5 DPS-classes thinking "damn our dps is too low, even though I'm hitting that hard, the others must suck pretty bad".
---
If you go with example 2, yeah you might hurt some special snowflakes, but if you get a single one of the DPS to question his rotation, get arc or practise his DPS you already won.
---
An alternative you could try for the gloves would be fused gauntlets that you can buy for laurels 
---
I understand that the branching narrative can't be done fully in any game as that would require an actual simulation of reality but the fact that they scrapped the player choice completely is a shame. 
---
Yes, all your choices lead to a same goal and that is OK. What I find detrimental is, that I feel disconnected.
---
A good example would be the orders of Tyria. Did the choice matter in the long run? No. Did it make player feel like they made an important decision? For me, yes.
---
I'm not saying that the movie called Guild Wars 2 is bad in any way but it's just that. A movie. The interaction is gone. When Aurene died in the last episode, I didn't feel a thing because I felt like I couldn't do anything. It didn't matter because it was decided before I had any input, even a fake one. 
---
The level of interaction that this interactive media provides at this point is, to qoute youtuber Shammy, "when I press the button, they (the Commander) do the thing". 
---
Every time they introduce a new feature all the stuff for it goes into the gemstore. Gliders? All but what? 4? Mount skins? All gemstore. It would be nice if we could find a way to earn something and not every cool thing for a new feature be gemstore. With your player housing, I hope you’re ready to spend 1000 gems on a measly wooden stool. 
---
Written certificate of debt back item. 
---
Jade Quarry died a while back. It used to be the no. 2 server in NA. You need to transfer to a more populated world, or a world with people in your timezone.
---
I agree. Chronomancer, Druid, and Berserker are the strongest PoF specs.
---
This is why I stay casual. No stress. They should keep raiding simple like they did with the Christmas raid. You create a divide between the casuals and the "elite" raiders types that think you should be able to solo every raid/fractal boss without armor, boons or food. If you didn't start raiding with a pro group from the start, you really don't have a place in a raid group unless you know someone. It seems like too much like a full time job. I use to raid in WoW. I remember all the drama. One day I got tired and just said screw this, this isn't even fun anymore. I like GW2 open world metas and story driven content. I just want to have fun. They can do whatever they want with raiding, 90% of us really don't care. I'm not saying they should get rid of it. I'm just saying to makes people toxic in the long run like PvPers or the fractal types.   
---
build templates

---
&gt; They'll forever have to monetize their game to be able to keep running and developing it.
---
No game will live forever
---
If you die in PoF a lot it means you know nothing about combat and your gear is propbably really bad. You will get slaughtered in HoT if can't hold your own in PoF.
---
&gt; My end goal is to get that thing on the top left corner of the map to 100% and I can't do it without the mounts
---
Take your time, learn your class, check dps rotations from raids to get a basic idea of what skills and traits interact well together. You're Holo. A traited Corono Burst (holo 3) gives you stability, use this stability to not get knocked away when using rifle3, follow up with 5 and 4.
---
Or X-wing
---
I remember. Well, I dont blame the for not doing it (as they never promised it, as stated correctly). But fucking hell, how far off can you be with such a "claim"? Like I said we dont even get 6 patches a year so how could they ever just hope for that?
---
Didn't know there was a Nintendo DS client for GW2.
---
The banners are so useful in teams that people will get funny if you don't use them, so you indirectly have two fewer skills to use. Rangers/druids have a similar problem with spirits and chronomancers are expected to dedicated two skill slots to lengthening boons in high difficulty content. 
---
For the other 90% of the game you can basically play what you want. For open world, you should be fine with warrior as you don't really need to worry about group composition and taking banners. 
---
You can take them both up to level 10 or so quite easily and if you go into the PvP practice area, all your skills are temporarily unlocked so you can get a feel for them 
---
If you enjoy it, play it. 
---
Maybe you haven’t been paying attention to how anet deals with hackers in the past but they often accumulate hackers accounts and ban them in ban waves. 
---
This prevents hackers from being able to identify how anet tracks them and therefore makes hacking considerably more difficult.
---
I’m no real expert on this and this is just what i roughly know about how anet goes about banning hackers 
---
Besides that, I don’t see these hackers that are everywhere as you claim. I play both wvw and pvp regularly and it’s been *months* maybe even over a *year* since I’ve seen a hacker. Though I do play on NA, maybe that plays a part in this but gw2 is one of the games where hacks are the least rampant tbh. 
---
All the dragons were able to absorb the magic from the other dragons when they died. when they died, an explosion of magic flew out and the dragons could snack on that despite not being present.
---
Nah, the effect on the bow and quiver was some magic from a scroll like the one that Aesgir used to fight Jormag and ultimately blast his tooth off. Nothing to do with Balthazar as far as we know.
---
Block them and then check every time you join a squad so you're not in the same squad, leave if they're present. 
---
this
---
thats why we have death-infuse primodius minions in ember bay and death-infuse jormag minions in chilly map for example 
---
Unfortunately you can't.
---
I'm not sure you payed attention to the story then, because it's common knowledge that the dragons absorb each others magic and gain their powers when they die, hence why you see death touched and vine touched dragon minions.
---
calling yourself a pro griffon rider 
---
&gt;They should keep raiding simple like they did with the Christmas raid. You create a divide between the casuals and the "elite" raiders types that think you should be able to solo every raid/fractal boss without armor, boons or food. 
---
That defeats the entire purpose of the raids.
---
MMO's **should** cater to different levels of skill and investment, It's a terrible idea to do it with the same content. Raids are supposed to be above casual level of play. If you're unwilling to invest the time or deal with the intricacies of raid team building then the content isn't for you, don't play it.
---
My bad. Seems I just wasn’t paying attention.
---
More 1 shot elite specs, and something to replace cancer mirage which will be nerfed before the next set of elite specs.^(/s but we all know the powercreep will be insane)
---
That would have been even more pro.
---
Join TORK. I hear they are a fight guild. Kappa
---
True, but if you are alert you can avoid it. Aginst Condi mirage you just die either way, can't move, can't use skills, guess I'll just stand still and burn to death. Then you add in the evades, invuln, stealth, teleport and clones bs with all the purple shit they throw around..
---
Gear up and learn to play your class first.
---
The entirely off the core game is piss easy and does a terrible job teaching the actual combat mechanics of the game as it can all be completed by auto attacking. Dungeons and fractals were the main area for people to learn in PvP as it's basically all we did before  we finally started getting content releases.
---
My suggestion is to play the content in order. Get Living World Season 2 first, play through that and use it to learn your class, Then play HoT and LS3 before moving on to PoF.
---
You really shouldn't have skipped just to get mounts, and you shouldn't focus on an elite spec till you know the in's and outs of the core class.
---
I just really want the next elite specs to be released in a better state. The power creep cannot continue, they have to take the time to make sure they balance them properly with what's already in the game. And this doesn't mean just in PvE - devs who are passionate about PvP and WvW should also have input, the PoF specs utterly broke the balance in these modes in the first few months, this cannot happen again.
---
That is the single biggest thing I want from the next expansion. Their super slow balance patch release cadence necessitates far more careful consideration - it's even better for new specs to be somewhat underpowered and tweaked later than what happened with PoF because it simply takes them too long to properly balance overpowered specs.
---
Besides that, build templates. But I've sort of accepted we will never get those. 
---
If anything they just forgot to add more Events and Exploration for THP.
---
I mean just the previous episode, Jahai was shoved full of events, Map gimmicks like Brand Tornado, with lots of exploration to do, as well as many Temporal rifts to explore alternate dimensions. 
---
I think they should work on putting things into THP, or at least tune up the Events. 
---
well maybe we need a middle ground then?
---
new map every 2-3 episodes. but the maps are expansion quality and crammed full of stuff. People STILL play the season 2 maps. maps like ember isles and lake doric are never that populated, kourna is almost empty.
---
This is precisely zero to do with what I said. I never said don't point it out. I said point it out in a way that does the most good. My first example pointed out we're not doing enough damage, without trying to make myself look better than everyone else.  We need to up our damage IS pointing it out. How you point it out makes all the difference.
---
In the example the OP gave, every single person wasn't pulling their weight. There's no reason to single anyone out for good or bad in that instance, because everyone wasn't pulling their way, perhaps except the guy saying it. 
---
Calling someone a snowflake because they don't like how you said something is part of the problem and why many pugs fall apart unnecessarily. 
---
If you're playing with a static group and people know each other, you can be more aggressive in how you speak. But text doesn't carry tone and believe me, misunderstandings are very easy. You don't know what other people have experienced or how they were raised.
---
For example, I'm 57 now. I grew up in a different time and people you don't know talk to you differently. So someone from my generation is more likely to be annoyed but some kid telling him off (get off the lawn!).  Doesn't make that person a special snowflake and the fact that you see people who don't think the way you do or react the way you do as special snowflakes is part of the problem.
---
I'm notoriously hard to offend, and I'm pretty good at taking criticism, but plenty of my friends aren't, and it's not because they're special snowflakes. It's because they were raised in a different world.
---
I wish I got 1 Black Lion Key everytime someone "theorized" that Aurene is gonna come back through Joko's magic. 
---
you forgot your /s
---
Condi Mirage is heavily countered by Weavers and Firebrands tho. 
---
Or, you know, we don't actually kill Kralkatorrik. 
---
if anyone needs /s for this, then OP is right
---
Jahai was good yeah...which is again part of the problem...that maps just..done....suns refuge being this big ol hub for...one episode?
---
No.
---
*Roger Gold Leader*
---
Well they least they could do with it was make it like a mini Home Instance, and allow players to put nodes in it. 
---
I like that I can access it with Sunspear Emblem. 
---
A lot of what anet does just feels like wasted ressources. They do this one time thing, then scrap it completely. Make insane models, then never use them again. Oh well.
---
Because everything is building up to this:
---
1. We met Joko for the first time in Domain of the Lost and if not for being imprisoned by Balthazar, he would just walk out of there.
---
2. We saw Joko die right in front our eyes, only to get up, snap his bones back into place and go on.
---
3. Aurene branding Caithe shows us that she gets parts of powers from other creatures's magic (Mordremoth in this case as she could overwrite his influence).
---
4. We have Awakened Sylvari showing us that Joko's magic is something independed from Zhaitan and its own thing.
---
5. "Nobody stays dead lately" quote.
---
6. "Lich is dead" quote from Odgen.
---
7. Entire "ascension" thing which is Mists related.
---
Literally everything points out to Aurene coming back.
---
I really hope you're not serious.
---
Because the game needed the visual cancer.
---
It was cancer in Guild Wars and it's cancer here. 
---
Its the hentai dlc. ;)
---
None of those are fine. Cat Ears are just another visual cancer. You know showing up to a speedclear in the original game with them would get you kicked? 
---
maybe fragmented episodes...
---
like instead of season 5 episode 1, episode 2
---
we'd have season 5 episode 1-1, episode 1-2, episode 2-1
---
I already own the game on my old account, which I can't retrieve.
---
Why are you so mad? I came here looking for any advice that might help regarding a truly flawed game design and others have offered some great tips while you're just being a cunt.
---
What we need is expansions actually giving us the majority of the new content instead of being staggered through the LS. Each EXP+LS should give us some 10 or so maps and some 7-8 should drop with the EXP itself, while the remaining few drop with the LS.
---
Nah, Uncle Kralky must have just passed by for a visit :)
---
Jokes aside, try repairing the game client https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/201863008-Repairing-the-Game-Client
---
I had same issue last year when I go to another country for Erasmus, you should just include game key on your ticket and they’ll respond more faster, mine solved in one day. 
---
Many suggestions to use the watch list. One problem with this is that doing so prevents the daily from showing up, which I at least find really annoying. The daily should be independent of the watch list.
---
I want ritualist to be a new class. Not gonna happen though so I think I'd settle for it being an elite specialization for either necro or revenant.
---
oh this right here i would be all over.
---
Trying to get to know different groups kn sedver i guess.
---
I've been in many, many guilds with the same mentality of yours in World of Warcraft. All of them broke up after a few weeks. People who think like you thinks that they are the best, but forget that other people have more things to do than spending 15h per day in front of a computer having theirs mom and dad to do everything for them, giving food, giving money and so on.
---
There are a lot of adult people who play the game who just don't care about being top 1 100% ultimate overpower super hardcore player. They just don't care, and this is completely fine and acceptable. People like you is the real disease who think that is the best player in the world and rage quit upon people who are actually having fun.
---
It really depends on the group, I think. Pointing out the DPS is too low doesn't inherently make you an asshole — indeed, it should be an important part of a training group to address such issues — but how you phrase it can make a world of difference, and what's appropriate will depend a lot on the goal of the group. Casually mentioning that people might want to brush up on their rotation, or even offering to help, is *miles* different from complaining that everyone else sucks compared to you. There's too much variation to say whether you were a bit of an asshole in this particular situation.
---
This is bad advice for wvw.
---
Kralk is exporting weapons.
---
Good thing we're not in the original game then. Or dunno, bad for all those people who can't handle others liking non-American, non-prudish stuff?
---
Oh my I found the IDIOT casual!
---
&gt;Everyone is expected to run cookie cutter builds? It's that mindset that killed pvp and makes raids hard to get into.
---
Did you literally just say the builds people spend many hours refining to be absolutely optimized then put out so you can use it and not your giver's spellbreaker... make raids hard to get into?  You would never get into raids to begin with if 'cookie cutter builds' is your attitude to this. Get ten people using their own obviously so good builds and then ten people using meta builds, both groups new to raids, and see which one does better. 
---
&gt;Just because something isn't meta, doesn't mean it's not viable, you could look at any other games and see that as well. 
---
Meta is viable in this game. Power Mirage can be a thing, but will it do well anywhere? Absolutely not. 
---
&gt;It's a Free to play game now anyways, there are going to be new people coming in, enjoying it, and trying to raid, elitism is a good way to kill the game.
---
F2P players can't play raids.
---
I totally understand that, thank you for the response!
---
Well, it's not an issue, since it'll drop the green plate as normal when you've done the room enough times. Happened to me yesterday.
---
Actually people with limited time tend to be better players - they *don't have the time* to be wiping so they want success as fast as it  can be acquired.

Same I hate lightbulbs. But this is amazing. Looks like one of fire legion "gods". so not only it's great looking but it's also lore fitting.
---
I usually only buy convenience item from the shop, the latest one being the mistlock sanctuary pass (which I love)
---
So I already have infinite salvage tools aswell so the last convenience Item I am really interesed in are infinite gathering tools.
---
I don't know how much math has been done around that but I am interested in getting the infinite volatile magic gathering tools that are on sale now.
---
They grand a lot of convenience combined with the profit of volatile magic shipmends.
---
Are there any "more profitable" gathering tools around or are these a safe bet?
---
You really have to wonder why WvW roamers think anyone cares about their videos. 
---
I tried to make one but runing animation and big shoulder armor skins made me change it to female.
---
Lol. GW2 was specifically designed as a casual game. All the features you mentioned, excl dungeons, didn't even exist at launch.
---
If you want a elitist, people-with-no-life-grind-fest, go to WoW and leave GW2 to the audience it was explicitly designed for.

Thank u, next.

The assholes are the people wasting our times not giving a crap. 5K Dps is just impossible on any build. Any power build or condi build for the matter can do more than 5k just by aa if they have right gear. 
---
The other day I was on a Desmina Run, the run had 10+ kp reqs. Little did I know it was one of those amazing half guid runs. So there we were, me the epi, druid the pusher and the chronos doing our hardest when one of the guildies was a power DH who could not last more than 20s in the fight (srsly he died almost always on the first wall) and a bunch of randies who did not have eyes and kept being hit by scythes and golems detonating. 
---
Its alright to help but people have to listen and have to give a crap. 
---
Your channel is fantastic! Is it ok if I reccomend it in the training doc I linked above? 
---
Then in GW2 we can experience the beauty of 10 pan scouts hitting a wall.

Can confirm, when I was styling my charr (necro) I found a *single* armour set I was actually happy with, and it was one of the cultural sets. Regular armour textures stretch horribly on them :/ I haven't realised how good I had it with the rest of my characters (mostly sylvari).

Some hero points have fights that are intended for around 3 players. Some builds can solo them but most of the time you'll find it next to impossible solo. Find a group running an "HP train" or just call out in map for help.

They haven’t been able to do it in the past, hopefully they’ve gotten their stuff together

Well I'm still new to the game, I started playing about 2 months ago and have had people telling me to follow snowcrows guide religiously for meta or no one would take me to raids. I've been working on the gear now so I can go raid in the near future so I don't know or understand how the builds work. I'm sorry if I sound uneducated because I really am I have no idea why some builds are made different to others and things like that. I just saw support chronos looking really cool with giving all of the buffs when I started playing the game. Again I have never gone raiding before so I have no idea what would work and would not work.
---
I like the current model more. It spaces out content in a sensible manner and keeps people engaged and occupied between expansions, instead of provoking them to desert the game for 2 years (and probably never come back).
---

&gt; Just because you're a BS doesn't mean it's OK to always be less than the DPS, and if you're doing more, tell the DPS off

* Have lowest dps
---
* Improve and outdps a dps
---
* Kick that dps for being bad, get a new one
---
* Repeat

Guild Wars 2 is developed for casual gaming in mind, accept it.
---
Elitists are those who ruin games. Elitists think they can decide what a meta is, while most their meta builds are not fun. Playing professionally or seriously is NOT fun. Winning in games is overrated, especially when it is not fun, too serious and organized. Losing in games is ok, failure is always an option, but never rage about it, just try again, again, again, again and again until successful. Patience goes long way.
---
People overvalue their time. If people are in such a hurry, why they spend time playing games with random players instead of spending time with their families in RL? Never hurry things. Take everything slowly and steadily. They are just games.
---
Organized gameplay is not fun either. Competitive gameplay is also not fun. Just take everything casually, never seriously. Stress is a bad thing for a human body.
---
Meta is a lie. Fractals don't have enrage timers, so why using meta builds there in a first place? Raids might need something meta-ish, but only because of the enrage timer. Also in Fractals people seem to want to burst everything down instead of having a long, proper fight.
---
Leeching is fun. In WvW I try to tag every single enemy player, then die (or run away) and let the rest of the ally blob do the actual killing. I just collect loot.
---
In open world PvE I just spam 1111111111 on bosses and collect loot. In Fractals and raids I just try to do my tasks. If I am a DPS, I DPS. If I am a healer, I heal. Nothing else. I don't care how much DPS I do. That stresses me out. Simple as that!
---
People have the right to play their games as they enjoy.
---
Have fun!
---
It also means that the people who come late to the party only get the 4 maps, while the regulars grind out the new maps and move on when the next one drops.
---
Out of curiosity, what was the blatant example of it? I do plenty of WvW but still haven't seen one, so my guess is Anet handles the reports rather quickly. I've seen some videos, so it does happen.
---
If you were simply inside a tower/keep and the enemy suddenly came and took it without taking walls down, that can be due to poor house-cleaning. Sometimes players either hide or sneak into keeps when other worlds are taking them and wait the cooldown. Those people tend to be roamers, so a good indication that they've done this is if there's a sudden stop in flipping activity near a keep. They also tend to be the same people.
---
I wonder how Palawa Joko looked when he was still alive.

Okay thanks for the help, I sent all that information to them (as much as I could which was quite significant). Hopefully I get an answer soon!

When I get items like [Mistward Pauldron Lining](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mistward_Pauldron_Lining) that are part of an item collection achievement, I don't have to keep them until I complete the set or is it safe to vendor them?

Why are you not wiling to share your experience, teach others, accept shortcommings, be tolerant and caring, create room for diversity, have fun with others, balance your emotions?
---
It pains me to imagine, what your life needs to look like, if I take you serious about what you are stating. It falls so short on so many levels... 😔 
---
I usually just farm what ever comes in my way. I am not specifically going for any level of ressource. When I have dailys in Gendarran fields, I get all the node in my way there.
---
If I am picking up temple armor from Orr, I am getting the nodes in my way there... and so on.
---
Safe to vendor. Most collection items are. 
---
I do not see what you said as problematic.
---
You had a specific role that gave you a DPS loss and you were better than pure dps. I know some people think this should not be said but it is a practical issues that reveals the problem. If people cannot handle mild criticism in training scenario then its it their problem.   
---
It is a general issue nowadays. People take criticisms on their abilities too seriously like it would be normal to be good at everything from day one. And not only in games. You were reasonably polite. If they got offended by that there is only so much you can do.

Thanks for the quick reply!

Doing some crafting and needed to free up some much needed bag space

New race. Tengu, Kodan, Largos, or something new.
---
I don't even look twice at the maps. As soon as I've done the story bits I leave and never come back. I usually don't even do the hearts, because they don't stay completed. We don't need new maps every single time to advance the story. Imo
---
Yes, GW2 is a f2p mmo.
---
It has been working fine for me for days (been buying massive amounts of crafting mats), however, it started acting up a couple of hours ago for me, too.
---
The scribe should get a chair novelty, because that damn discipline has so many crap recipes nested and nested and nested with each other that it takes ages to craft anything. 
---
**Badass.**
---
I'd prefer if they added a map and then expanded on it like Season 2 had with Dry Top and Silverwastes.  That way it's not a one and done deal.  This means they can expand a map with events, collections, more area to explore, etc.  Also the map should connect to a base game map or an expansion map every time.
---
That no longer exists. It's overcast now. 
---
Of course, it would have to be used to change the behavior of skills, too, giving them bonus effects under a certain amount of Overcast energy.
---
Unfortunately I haven't been having an easy time. I have been having a lot of time spent in down state, LOL! That's why I was looking for something that would help guide me towards a build that would make life easier for me. 
---
Me: Alexa? Who is Joko?
---
Alexa: Joko is our beloved saviour. He killed Zaithan and Mordremoth. He also released people of Elona from terrors of Balthazar's ambush. Joko is our God! Our only God! ... PRAISE JOKO!
---
This would be awesome if released like the elergy and requiem armors were.  Obviously without the nullification sigil bullshit and in a release/update/living story episode that made sense.
---
I don't agree I love the Story but I normally get it done on the day the episode drops and then go on to enjoy exploring the new map and all the new things we can do in it for at least a few weeks that follow. What would I do after day 1 your way...go back to waiting for next one all be it a little less time.
---
crystalized magic or something
---
Me: Volatile Magic will do fine  
---
Andy: No, they won't
---
Thanks for the video, I learnt alot of what to look out for when fighting thieves. 
---
Good enough for me. Im not looking for a extreme grind in that case i would be playing warframe.
---
I hope we will. Otherwise there's much less incentive to play LS5 maps.
---
Open a ticket on support.
---
Video proff. The time and where it happened is also important.
---
Agreed. FFXIV did it pretty well with their MSQ and side quests, they reused a lot of their old maps. And it felt good. It enhanced the environment and really made the world feel full. The direction GW2 seems to be taking is extremely theme park-esque. Feels formulaic.
---
Eh... as purely F2P mmo not that good imho. You get a ton of content for free but there's a lot more and better content behind the pay wall. That said, you can easily get like 50-100 enjoyable hours out of free version and then maybe decide to shell out some cash.
---
You could try repairing the game client.
---
&gt; Its not about adding new maps, its about making them enjoyable so people replay them.
---
They can't just keep releasing highly replayable maps because that would split the player population too much. I'd say that's one of the main issues right now - purposefully releasing short-lived maps just so players move together once a new map is released.
---
who cares. i hope we will get content that lasts longer.
---
i was done with the last episode after 3 hours. sure i can grind weeks for the new weapon set ... but  why? 
---
You need the Finders Keepers title
---
I mostly agree with this. While I am not a huge fan of Dry Top, I really enjoyed the progression. Though I'm not sure how well it would work with the current scale of events happening in each release. If I remember correctly, during S2 the plot was pretty contained. We basically just tracked the clues left behind by Scarlet, and then followed the egg. Those things made sense to happen in close physical proximity of each other. 
---
But now, we assaulted a dragon this episode while dealing with tears in the mists in the last. Those things make sense being somewhat spread out. So I think there would have to be abig shift in scope if we were ever to return to the S2 model
---
Then try it out , it's a great game , and there is a lot to do for free. BUT the expansions add A LOT to the game. ( if you catch a sale it's about $27 for both bundled together ).
---
i play this game since release. but I would not recommend it.
---
pvp is in a awful state. the community gets more elitism day by day. this game gets regular content updates but the amount of things to do is very limited. you are done with the new content after 2-4 hours. after that you can grind for new skins. that's it.
---
this game was good couple years ago. but now it's just more of the same and boring.
---
I feel like there must be a way to extract the model from the game... I just have no idea how those dat file hunters do what they do.
---
Yeah seems to be the same cause for me. V annoying though
---
It would be wonderful if you can bring it online today, I need to clean up some inventories and today I have some free time :|
---
We know. We all know. 
---
3h it's story wise and discovering a bit the new map. There is much more time involved if you do achievements and explore the map + all events. 
---
Maybe you don't do it but that doesn't mean that isn't content!
---
Technically mounts already have an attack ability on skill 1, but I'm guessing you're talking about OP using their weapon skills while "mounted". Its just a client-sided visual bug. Tends to happen when you dismount though there's no clear way to reproduce the effect. Basically from the waist down the mount is in what ANet uses for their T-Pose (though not quite a full T shape). [Here's a different clip of this happening around September 2017](https://clips.twitch.tv/TolerantClumsyRaisinLitty) Initially they're riding the griffon in the generic mounted pose, though the Griffon is posing harder than a Jojo protagonist. When they get stunned thats when the pose changes to them standing on the mount itself.
---
No. The sub rules don't say 'youre not allowed to advertise your own videos'.
---
They say this, word for word:
---
"This is not your personal Youtube display. To share your videos one should take part in the community outside of their own posts.
---
For this reason you need to follow the 80/20 rule. To put it simply, the amount of your own content in your history should only be fifth of the total amount of activity in our subreddit. Ignore this rule and your content will be removed until you meet the criteria."
---
So as long as OP posts other stuff as well it's fine.
---
I'd prefer a shift to 1 good and repayable map to getting 3 disposable maps.
---
While looking backwards ;)   try it :3
---
Oh me too. But I'm just wondering how they'd justify that from a plot progression standpoint
---
The issue is entirely with their design philosophy. It doesn't matter if they spent an entire year on a map, because if they followed the same pattern of content it would last players 4 weeks instead of 1.  
---
Unless you promote lasting value (elements of replayability, longterm goals, and meaningful incentives) your content just won't last. And the thing with these story updates and maps is that they are VERY weak in these areas.  
---
Keep in mind that you'd be somewhat limited as f2p. For example, you can sell only certain things on trading post and you won't be able to exchange in-game gold for gems, but you could still buy gems for real money. There are many other benefits to unlocking the full game of course, but give f2p a try and see if you like it before considering purchasing one or both expansions.

Ok that's a really good point and i've totally missed it thank you. I thought that camera movement was something players could manually do.
---
The sylvari must have got it from the same source. Nothing like a pair of shoulder pads could can ride a raptor. 
---
For a healing Renegade in fractals, I'm assuming one should take either the trait that makes the tablet heal or the one that makes staff orbs heal, or both, as otherwise I note it doesn't have a way to give Regeneration and that's fairly important if people have to move (i.e. Siax during split) as they can't always be on the tablet?
---
isnt every focus made by an artificer an artifact?
---
Indeed, and it's rather sad. With the flood of LS maps we've received in LS3 and LS4, most of them feel just forgotten. I'd really prefer to see more map quality instead of the quantity of mostly mediocre maps (there are exceptions) we're getting right now. One map can also be used for two or three story episodes if they'd do it right.
---
Yeah I really want to frame the rest of the prints as well tbh, but I'm kinda running out of wall space &lt;3
---
It does capture some of his devious and scheming ways. I mean from what we could gather in the books, he's a son of Vabbian noble diplomats and became a friend/rival of Oswald Thorn. The image captures a certain smugness about him. The same type that came up when he stated he wouldn't raise the Beast Marshal Oluwa Eranko, because she respected the Commander.
---
im not talking a massive shift here, you're going from one extreme to another as if its a binery on/off switch.
---
if a map is added every other episode, but episodes would come more frequently every 6-8 weeks.
---
that means on average maps are given one more month in the oven. also just cause an episode doesnt add new maps doesnt mean it just gives story, there can be more events dropped into the last episodes map. more achievements added, even add more to the maps in the form of mini dungeons and jumping puzzles.
---
I will try my best to answer your points.
---
* I GW2 you have boons that increase your damage output like lower cooldown, faster attack speed, higher crit chance and of course higher power/condition damage. In raid and fractal environments you want one or more classes to give everyone those needed boons. You also don't want those classes to do just that so you try to balance it perfectly in a way where you can squeeze out the most damage for the group without losing 100% uptime on those very important boons. You also have modifiers like the scholar runes who give 10% damage increase if you have over 90% HP.  
---
So in GW2 a role is mostly either a damage dealer or someone who gives boons to everyone or heals enough that people have their scholar uptime for example. Builds usually have dps numbers to aim for that people can compare against with arcDPs (or the ingame DPS golem which has different numbers though).  
---
The only exception might be a full healer but even druids in raids usually try to swap out some gear for more power focused gear as long as they still have enough healing power left to make sure nobody loses scholar uptime or even dies. This depends on the group and how experienced they are. If people are good with boss mechanics and don't take much damage the druid can play more aggressively.
---
* In open world PvE everyone is responsible for their own survival in high level fractals and raids you usually have a dedicated healer or two. So playing a druid in open world events is maybe not that rewarding but you still get event credit for healing others I believe. So even if you don't do much damage it could be fun but if you run around by yourself you can run into trouble. That's why most people will tell you to gear for power until you hit lv 80 and even then for solo roaming it's probably the best (unless you get killed often and want some kind of protection but even then people would tell you to just learn to play ;P)  
---
So regarding playing a healer in raids or fractals it depends on what class exactly you play. Some can mitigate the next hit, so you have to time that. Others like scourge give people barrier (temporary extra HP) that also has to be timed well. A druid can kinda focus individual people with a waterfield + blast combo but other classes like guardian for example would be better for focus heals.  
---
Overall I would say that healer tend to sustain a basic healing that everyone gets who is close enough so in a perfect world as a healer you would not have to focus individual allies. But in that case you would also not spec full healing gear and people would expect some damage output from you as I explained before.  
---
Therefore I would say that it can be boring if you want to play perfectly save but it doesn't have to be. I depends on the class you play and the people you play with.
---
* The endgame in GW2 is basically skins and stuff. You do get nice gold from fractals and even raids if you are in a good group but the main motivation for people who play raids is probably the need for a challenge and the fun you can have with a good (=friendly) group. For fractals it might be more money oriented since the challenge is lower, it's usually faster, more forgiving and requires less setup while still giving good amounts of gold.  
---
Even if you most likely have the ascended gear already (in fractals its more or less required to have full ascended) you still get currencies you can use to gear your other characters or you can bunker resources for later in case the meta changes and you have to regear everything.
---
Yes, it sounds weird, right? Staff Weaver was top DPS for so long because of large hitboxes + meteor shower. Of course, there are more things to consider than dps, like  if the elite spec is good enough for that specific raid boss. 
---
Yeah, admittedly I also just bought Path of Fire online, I do prefer physical copies if I can get them though. &lt;3  
---
It's a shame guildwars 2 haven't done any collectors editions since launch, but then again their Core game CE was amazing
---
I never had to pay for a chapter so i'm not ressentful of gw2 bussiness model. But i m aware that it s not the case for everyone. I wonder how it feels for a new player.
---
That raptor statue looks amazing! You even modeled individual scales and tons of little details and the coloring is fantastic as well.
---
And i just saw that the saddle is even detachable!
---
Most people would probably have gone for a 3d print at that level of detail so props to you for being able to do all of this detailed work by hand.
---
I really love having the stat-swappable backpack, though it is true that those stats are the lowest of any equip slot. It's just nice when updating / reworking builds to know that, on any character, I can put whatever is recommended in that slot. Same goes for Aurora, which makes a more noticeable difference in your stats.
---
I've never actually made a legendary weapon, as I always felt their utility was rather limited compared to things like this, which can be used by all your characters. And now with fractals &amp; raid drops / vendors, 2 sets of elite spec collections, and Knight of the Thorn, getting ascended weapons has never been easier. But that's just my two ~~cents~~ blues and a green.
---
Wow! Nice rig and collection!

Thanks!

GW2 has the same pitfalls as any other game in regards to PVE mainly the pruning and manipulation of classes throughout the years. Play styles have been lost and the classes are nothing how they were initially things started to take a heavy handed change when they shifted gears into E-sports and then again when they wanted to introduce raiding.  
---
Fun builds lost because they weren't Esport viable and trinity elements shoehorned into the game such as the taunt mechanic at a much later date.  You've played WoW so your well aware of how bad pruning can change a game.  However I mention it now because GW2 is all over the place in regards to playstyle.  The game didn't launch with trinity in mind and to this day open world content doesn't require it you only really need such mechanics in raids.  Builds for PvP, WvW, Fractals, Puzzles/Games, Open World, and Raids all vary wildly depending on the mode.  
---
For some the fun of the game comes from so many different modes however for people like myself it becomes a hindrance primarily because while this game has many ways to play it lacks templates. Your raid build might do beans in WvW but that requires changing every manually from mode to mode.  Initially in PvP you'd load up with a seperate bar and gear the mode loaded its own separate template when you entered it which was nice but then during the esport era of this game they removed it.  
---
So yeah GW2 is a game that has many different modes that suit the tastes of many different people making it easier for them to find something they deem fun yet at the same time shoots itself in the foot from time to time.

Hi guys, I just wanted to share my raptor sculpture with you all :D He's the first larger sculpture I ever made and all his horns and scales are put on individually. A lot of work (and love) went into making this little guy :D
---
The are other roles, like condi dps (because some bosses are only vulnerable to condi, some take more condi than direct dmg etc), tank (usually a chrono) and healer/buffer (Druid is mostly a buffer to keep specific boons up via their special CA form and spirits, Scourge is basically a Scholar from FFXIV that shields aka barrier, ele is like a white mage with a lot of passive sustain and some active burst heal).
---
Most PUG'S run 2 Chrono's (one tank,one support), a druid for might buffing and heals, a secondary healer (another Druid or FB, Herald, Ele, Scourge), rest dps.
---
High lvl fractals are a good source of income and you get relics to buy stuff like infinite fractal potions (perma stat boosts in fractals). Raids reward mostly 2g per boss iirc and Legendary Insights (LI is the raid currency basically) to upgrade certain armor to legendary. Plus you get mag shards to buy ascended armor/weapons directly.

---
I don't really have the energy to write out another comment.  I'm satisfied with my answers in these 2 threads.  There are some other good answers amongst them too.  The short summary is that GW2 has a soft-trinity up until end-game.  All classes and elite specializations have the capacity to express elements of the trinity in their core gameplay (DPS, Support, Control) so long as they understand what tools are at their disposal and when/where to use them. 
---
Often times this never manifests itself because players are convinced the game is "shallow," or that "Dead Trinity = Dead Game."  It's not that there isn't a trinity -- it's just that it's in a non-conventional form that puts more pressure on players to own up to their mistakes.  Later on dedicated healers and boon-supports do exist, but they're extremely uncommon up until that point. 
---
I generally don't find healing in GW2 very interesting; it's mostly just topping people off with large AoE's like Druid/CA Rejuvenating Tides, giving them love taps with Lunar Impact or various other classes having different forms of sustained healing such as Soulcleaver's Summit's life steal aura, Ventari Tablet/Natural Harmony (burst heals) and so on.  There's not a whole lot of depth to healing in GW2 although the best way to heal is to anticipate when people take damage and be ready.  On the upper, upper-end of the spectrum players in GW2 with really high DPS don't tend to need nearly as much healing as casual or pug groups.  
---
I enjoy (5 man co-op/mini-dungeons)  Fractals &amp; (10-man) Raiding in GW2.  There's definitely room for DPS improvement both in a vacuum at a golem and in real combat scenarios.  Combat in GW2 tends to challenge players to upkeep DPS and often times golem benchmarks don't equate to practical or realistic DPS -- they're mostly just a benchmark for muscle memory and comfort level.  
---
It's their fault for making the rock jumping so obnoxious. It's like you have to guess which rock part won't make you fall to death even though they are all similar. I hate that jp for that reason.

&gt;thus best overall as of now?
---
On a golem and some very specific situation yes. In many realisitc situations on actual bosses it's not a practical build to use because you need to be kneeled, bring close to no utility to the team and have like 0 cleave.
---
Also the "burst" pattern may not be the same as other classes (Weaver/DH) and you don't have access to the bomb like DD does on the bosses it's available.
---
All of this to say that on a vacum/on paper it's the best but there is more to team composition than stacking nothing but the top benchmark build.
---
i bought GW2 in 2014 near the end of season 2, but only played for about a month.
---
just around april last year i got into the game hard...but that meant i had to buy both expansions, all of season 2 save for 2 episodes i had
---
buy all of season 3
---
and buy daybreak.
---
my wallet hurt after that but the ammount of content you get for $2 (full season bundles are cheaper) i felt was great value...and that was for season 2 episodes.
---
i expected season 3 episodes to be bigger and longer cause full maps but...they weren't...some were shorter than season 2...and when  i did the story in them there wasnt much left to do, populations were often too low to do events so i moved on.
---
Not ignoring 2/3 of the game to focus on two hours worth of lukewarm story every 4 months could probably do a lot. 
---
we dont fully know what goes on behind the curtain. bits of info here and there gives the impression that their internal development tools are real annoying to work with and can hurt content production speed.
---
i think they need to put some resources into improving some development tools and ease the burden. something we players wouldn't ever see.
---
from my own experience in the game modding scene i can tell you good tools vs bad tools make an enormous difference with productivity.
---
As someone who played both gw2/ff14, I will try to answer your questions and  compare  both games a bit.
---
While ff14 combat does feel really slow at first, it gets much better at max level, you will have 2-3 off cooldown skills to use between each skill with the global cooldown.
---
Gw2 on the other hand is more dynamic and faster paced obviously, since its action combat.
---
Gw2 did advertise as no trinity, but thats not true at all anymore. In raids there are dps roles, a tank, and supports (healers, and boon (buff) providers). Difference is that some classes can do more than 1 role if you change build/spec.
---
Difficulty wise, I would say ff14 raids are much harder, and closer to wow difficulty than gw2, and personally I would say they are much more fun with more mechanics, while most gw2 bosses are more like a dps golem. Obviously gw2 has some fun bosses as well, but overall if you are looking for endgame experience then go for ff14.
---
Whats good in gw2 though is that once you have the endgame gear it will never become useless. With raiding you can get legendary armor, which offers free stat/rune swapping, and a ‘cool’ (objective) skin.
---
Fractals, the 5 man endgame in gw2, or the new dungeons are however better in gw2, if we compare them to ff14 dungeons which are a snooze fest.
---
Also leveling experience, and open world, crafting, pvp and QoL are also in favor of gw2, ff14 has some really bad QoL systems, pvp is boring, ton of filler quest etc.
---
Story wise however ff14 beats gw2 a lot, much better written story.
---
Overall it depends what you are looking for in the game, if you want sth similar to wow then ff14, if you want something new/fresh then gw2 (but eso is also worth checking out)
---
If you have any more questions feel free to ask.
---
T4 Snowblind fractal
---
This Weaver thinks that since he's an Weaver he has the highest dps and decides to just stand on the cold during the whole time and not help with the bonfires.
---
Dies twice to hypothermia and has the lowest dps.
---
I say "hey don't stay all the time on the cold, you'll die of hypothermia"
---
He responds "actually you suck!" and leaves
---
No worries, I got it.
---
And daredevil
---
Yeah for raids it's basically only be realistic on extremely stationary bosses with almost no cleave (and Qadmin kiter which just a weird boss to categorize).
---
HoT and PoF
---
Core: fractals, silverwastes farm, world bosses I guess
---
HoT: metas, all of them
---
PoF: Istan farm, or at least hit Pala and GH
---
If you want to farm to lv 80 dungeons
---
If you want to farm central mastery fractals or cof
---
If you want hot exp tarir meta in auric basin
---
Pof mastery istan but pof masteries have smaller requirements if i recall.
---
so basically the same as most console games but we didn't just pay £40 for it. personally love all the grindy ap's that come with new maps. And those weapon set little missions have encouraged me to play lots of the classes I generally ignore.
---
The one map per episode really adds value to the episodes. Just having instanced story chapters isn't as great as having an entire map with unlockables/collectibles besides it.
---
Give it! I will praise him, I will praise him so hard, then make him tell me the work boss timers!
---
This deserves more upvotes. The detail is fantastic!
---
Are you going to try the other mounts?
---
I'd definitely buy the warrior obsidian armor, i'd love to have it on my GW2 warrior after working so hard to get it back in GW1.
---
&gt; "We have the mechanics down. Good job guys! Now we need to work on our damage. Please make sure you have the right gear, traits and skills equipped. You can check here reallyhelpfullink what's recommended. If you have any questions about your build, please feel free to ask. I'm happy to help."
---
"Would you like to get your dick sucked too, to get you in the mood?
---
The lag causes that.
---
it does. but the maps do feel lesser than they could be for it. it comes at a cost i think and id happily take fewer, better maps than many lesser ones.
---
i mean there could be ways to address the problem and not change the cadence.
---
maybe an additional living world team, and a change to make the episodes themselves bigger and better, longer story, more crammed into the maps.
---
I mean the high ping lol
---
Thank you for those kind words :D I've already started on my griffon mount, so if all goes well, he'll be posted here  soon too :D
---
Yeah sorry, got up 5 min ago and havent had my coffee yet. 
---
Was generally asking for help with Elementalist but looking to see what stats most classes lean toward, Metabattles seems to always have power builds as #1 for everything.   
---
This is sort of to help myself/my friends I play with that don't have reddit. 
---
you can but I wouldn't...chat and trading is limited and all though you do have a huge amount open to you you will be playing alongside people that have so much more and i doubt you will enjoy it for long. That said I dont think there is a truly f2p mmo out there they will all want your cash somewhere along the way for something. In GW2 I believe we have the fairest examples of when we NEED to part with real world cash. I really recommend trying it for free and if you like it buying the expansion when they are on sale which just lately seems to be every 5 minutes.
---
The DPS numbers that people complain about are typically drastically lower than simply auto attacking on a meta build. What seems to happen is that people start training for raids, but realize they die a lot. They change their build to survive better and think "this works better for me." The problem is, they were dying because of screwed up mechanics, not a squishy build.
---
Basically, what I'm saying is that low DPS tends to come from a worse issue than just not dealing with a mechanic. The player was straight up not properly equipped to deal with raids. If you're exceptionally patient, you can work with them to fix their build, gear, and maybe even their rotation, but that's spending nine people's time to do what they were too lazy to set up properly.
---
Allow me to upgrade them to the higher version. I need so many of them and lack the luck to get them out of my ascended trinkets lol. 
---
Fellow Dark Knight too I see, it's the level 66 set I think.
---
Here be dem vendors:
---
https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/Doman_Steel_Tabard_of_Fending
---
It's pretty easy to see if boon uptimes are low. When you see low boon uptime, though, you have to consider the reason. Is the player not standing in wells or is otherwise off group? If the boon uptime is low across the board, that's unlikely. It's also pretty easy to identify the issue if one player is significantly higher DPS than the rest of the squad, since that shows that at least one player has decent boon uptime.
---
It doesn't matter Arenanet has not come out and said they are changing the release schedule if they do that I'll apologise but until then this bullshit of every 3-4 months because a few episodes were delayed. Episode 1 released 2 months after PoF. Episode 4 released 3 months after Long Live the Lich. Things get delayed this doesn't mean every update is over 3 months. I'm not being a dick about it but I hate it when people say complete false hoods like every 3-4 months. I hope I made this clear.
---
I followed your guide before and will do so again. 
---
Top guide.
---
Yup! it's awesome!
---
I do miss a lot of the old visuals.
---
I've enjoyed so far!
---
My idea is: make one season without maps. Instead use core tyria area. Make it accessible for free players too. Rework them so each region (ascalon, kryta etc) have it's own currency. Add some vendors selling either new or unobtainable in pve armors (like those from legacy pvp track) and new minis and stuff. This will save a lot of time because maps are done. They could make each episode longer with more instanced. 
---
It's just a name for the item.
---
It could be an easter egg by being a reference to [something else](https://www.gamecrate.com/sites/default/files/field/image/artifact-cost-5.jpg) .
---
i am stoked they keep updating this game!
---
id like to see a sort of, side quests or side stories tab added to the story journal. just side episode length chapters that arent key to the plot. they could add personal episodes where you hang out with specific members of dragons watch and gets some good character development in, or tie up loose story ends that wont fit in the main narrative.
---
i wouldn't care if they're lower budget with almost all text dialogue.
---
modern gw2 has most of old trinity from other games 
---
- you wan your dps glasscannons
---
- you want your support boon/healbots
---
- sometimes you want a tank
---
so except from typical aggro control from other games, everything else is already there
---
What did he say at 0:27?
---
Yeah now I know, checked geography of the place.
---
Doing training raids through LFG frequently, you run into really low DPS players a lot. I had a 560 DPS hammer warrior on Cairn once. That was fun.
---
Lunar new year is the worst festival in the game so it's for the best to not expect much. It'll probably begin February 5th.
---
I've never felt more completely out of touch with the next generation than I do now. Back in the day, when people were looking for somewhere to rent/own, they considered things like how many bedrooms/bathrooms it had, how big the kitchen was, how nice the living room was. But Gen Z searches for one thing: does this house have a streaming room?
---
That's one way to skip sub rules of no stream advertisements.
---
what events? the new map is empty. theres almost nothing to do.
---
yes. ESO does is very well
---
This looks epic! Nicely done!
---
youtube search "guildwars 2 mesmer skills" or other classes
---
not worst...more like nothing really to do - you buy envelope daily and do daily to get more envelope to get pure gold, you play arena ..which some like some dont and thats it... its more free gold fro everyone and some "be happy" for chinese part of players
---
Those weapon achievements are a fucking mess. A bunch of them overlap (kill 30 enemies, kill 60 branded), focus is bugged, and a few of them are just designed in such an annoying way (kill 5 enemies while under 10% health, kill 10 enemies without getting touched). 
---
Quite simple, it's a normal room, that's separated from the rest of the house by the room that got the washing machine / and all that stuff  
---
but it just means that It's a roam I spent the effort on adding proper lighting, blocking the natural light, and applied foam on the walls for sound correction, hence there is no sound reverb  
---
in essence see it as an office with different furniture, for a different kind of job
---
As far as I know, yes :(
---
Inb4 Malyck shows up in dragon form.
---
New currency? Definitely.
---
New magic? Not necessarily.
---
It largely depends on how the story of this season concludes.
---
I see it differently. If Anet benefits, the player benefits. I'd rather see this game thrive and prosper rather than cling onto my money and complain about every episode I didn't get for free, denying the joy the game is bringing me and the effort that is being put into it by people who need to eat and pay rent.
---
If everyone was like that, we'd never see a new expansion because there would be no funding to create one. 
---
Yeah, I had a sin/dervish crit build, and It's still one of my favorite builds in any MMO's of all time  
---
just life leaching on every single crit so if I had more than one enemy on me would I essentially be invincible \^\_\^ 
---
I'll address your points slightly out of order. First, I never said all the enemies in this video were terrible, just the majority. This is a nicely edited clip of you one shotting people who never react. Many are extremely low rank and some legitimately appear to be afk. The outnumbered fights were fun and I commend you for them as they're really the only worthwhile clips unless you duel someone skilled. Cheese shattering a major from stealth is boring. I can read the game well this is why your video bores me because I see their ranks and general skill and it's laughable. 
---
No one said na is top tier but the thing with NA is even bad players are geared and running the strongest cancer they can find. Doesn't matter if you're trash at soulbeast when you 15k rapid fire from the safety of your roving 5 man or just roll condimirage. The players in this video are not only running hilarious builds they also hardly seem geared with the damage they eat. 
---
Your childish response jumping to conclusions about myself just shows you know what I'm saying is right. Moving to attack people who criticise you rather than defending the choices you have made is going to hurt you in life. 
---
this should not make me LoL out loud but it does. like, really really loud.
---
now its the boxing gloves. still waiting and waiting and waiting
---
It may not be fun for everyone, but it prints so much gold for players that it’s pretty crazy good to make money on.
---
well the bulk of the tech guys are in the expansions team, and no expansion this year seems to indicate the tech guys have been busy elsewhere. 
---
for example episode 3 we seen they developed a new set of tools for creating in game cinematics with a new animation system. that tech right there would speed up development of cutscene and we wont see that tech used a lot till season 5 because the rest of season 4 was in development around the same time.
---
jahai implemented a new phasing system that allows NPC's to follow you and give banter in the open world. giving them another tool in the toobelt to more easilly deliver story content.
---
newest episode added new systems for large scale set peices in instances with a lot of map changes and destruction. so stuff like the final story step in path of fire can be easier to produce.

Just wanted to note that power firebrand be is a thing now with diviners gear.
---
In that circumstance, that's not a problem -- other than needing to find a replacement.
---
SAB used to start on thursday so I don't see why they couldn't patch the festival in on 22nd and flip the switch on 29th.
---
&gt; Example 1: I don't think we're doing enough damage, bois. We have the mechanics down.
---
The problem with saying that is that some people don't have the selfawareness and would go "oh its not me, its a team problem. maybe if they all push 10% more we get it, but my dps will be plenty".
---
I've not found that to be the case with ESO at all.  Maybe they release that content faster than you personally can consume it, but certainly not faster than I have been able to, and I am certain plenty of others as well.  That's why filler content exists like Alliance Wars and Dungeon progression, etc. 
---
Sylvari are def one of my favorite races, they are just so unique.
---
I've actually not had the greatest experience in WvW so far. I tried some Shiro Roam build on my Revenant but I had mostly no idea of what I was doing and it felt more like whoever had the bigger group of player would win the skirmish. 
---
This feeling probably comes from my inexperience and if WvW is anything like you describe it. It sounds very appealing to me. So how can I get past the "I have no idea of what happened but we/they are all dead" phase? Most WvW guide in the subreddit are either outdated or aimed towards people who want to be commanders. Do you have any ressource (streamer, youtuber,...) to get me started? 
---
Nice, thanks so much.  Have only hit 62 as DK so far, so I will have to look out for that.
---
Is that a building in the background, or something on the character's back?
---
I did say that in what I wrote so, yes, I agree with you.
---
Personally I haven't had this issue on EU. It's even fine in fast songs and songs with double octave switches. My ping is also pretty high (70-80ms), so I don't know why I'm not getting it but you are. 
---
You can change the character selection music by creating a MainMenu playlist using the method the other guy linked.
---
Updated content is a big thing for me. Sure we got a new guild hall when PoF came out, but that is one small aspect of guild content. So far, there have been no new weekly guild missions, and guild hall level rewards cap at 69. Influence, guild commendations, and other guild currencies have very limited uses to the point where you roll in them and don’t have a use for them anymore. I’m thankful for the social platform guilds provide but this game is lacking on actual guild content.
---
Yeah, look at the insane amount of custom scenarios used for LW4-2, from the laboratories with the puzzles to the gigantic finale at the central building. Then Sandswept Isles just feels empty, and there's barely anything to do.
---
The problem isn't about new maps, but how the resources are spent, and they spend too many of them on the story, and not enough in the actual MMO content.
---
Yes, you can do that by earning every available mastery.
---
The requisite of any traning run, wether you use community groups such as Raider's Inn or a guild or a pug ask for decent gear and a somehwhat understanding of rotations. If they do not explicitly say this (the community groups do btw) then it is implicit that they want you to run proper gear. 
---
Running crap food is one thing, I do that myself when on training runs (food aint help if guy does not throw a bomb at sab) but outright running crap gear is a lack of respect towards other players who possibly spent some time and gold gearing their characters and training on the golem. 
---
Yes lack of dps might be because of bad buffs, but from the looks of it, the run OP was in had good buffs. And even then, if you're running druids, they only need to mash buttons to cap might and fury so if those buffs are not present, they either don't know how to do it (which leads us back to lack of preparation and care), don't have the gear to do it(same point as before) or the organization of the group is a mess which could mean lack of knowledge about mechanics. Same for mesmers. Mesmers these days have it way easier than before when it comes to boon application. 
---
No. U have to get all the mastery points for that region (Ie. HOT, central Tyria, PoF) before you can start earning spirit shards.
---
Pvp gives tons of spirit shards though.
---
It's funny, because the only thing you need to make Thunderhead Peaks work is just some rift invasions.
---
They would give players stuff to do between the meta events, and also provide easy ways to farm branded masses.
---
Heck. thanks.
---
This is the only way, unfortunately. I wish the spirit shards were a selectable track that just repeated. 
---
If you're not offering suggestions on how to improve leave it at qe dont have the damage and not what could be interpreted as a clock stroking of I'm 3x better than everyone else. Not saying that's what you said, but there's a difference between offering advice and assigning blame elsewhere. People aren't going to take the way you phrased it well. Dont raid in GW2 but experience in other raids? If you're not the raid leader I'd bench your ass for the phrasing barring an apology to the group for how it was addressed. 
---
Typically my stance is. Dont talk about the numbers unless you know how to help them get higher. Dont call out the raid group if you're not in charge. Leave that to the RL and just send them your thoughts. Dont like their answer? Leave. Not on you to fix a failing group if the leader cant see 2+2 cant be 5.
---
Makes sense I just wasn’t setup for recording at all 
---
It's their fault they don't want to use it for more episodes. Spending all those resources for just one episode is a complete waste of time, for both the developers and the players.
---
That's fantastic! Amazing attention to detail.
---
You motherfucker, you got me LUL
---
A charr ele being outside a tower with all walls up which we swept pretty damn well then suddenly inside and killing a lord in about 3 sec. Hell even if they weren’t hacking it would have taken them far longer just to run up to the lord using conventional means. 
---
200 ms is ok, 300ms is almost unplayable. You will have a hard time playing classes that require constant weapon swapping or attack really fast.
---
Source: I play on 180-200 ms ping and when it spikes to 300 ms I just stop playing.
---
They would need to spare some time to make any guild system improvements.
---
Perhaps they could add more guild slots (maybe expandable via gold or gems upgrades) and ability to reorder positions of guilds in panel. Better MotD window - it's the worst UX in the whole game; you have to operate with arrow keys not seeing or knowing where the text cursor is. A guild calendar was recently suggested with mockup - that would ease organizations of guild events. A special "messenger" rank that would allow to send items and messages to the guild members in a bulk - not connected to standard mailing system. An alliance system would be cool but IMO it should working independently from joined guilds and with own chat channel (perhaps on the way in some form with WvW reword - if that's going to happen).
---
More content which was suggested thousand times - if they don't have time for something new then at least connecting existing activities and tasks (events, jumping puzzles, races, PoF bounties) to the guild missions system where people could be rewarded with commendations.
---
&gt;I don't play ESO
---
we can talk after u played it
---
I seem to sit around the 235 mark, doesn't really fluctuate from that.
---
Ohai, that's my guild in green
---
A drooburt that get's ignored
---
&gt;I like the current model more. It spaces out content in a sensible manner and keeps people engaged and occupied between expansions, instead of provoking them to desert the game for 2 years (and probably never come back).
---
The problem with relying too much on the LW is that everything feels so disconnected.
---
When you get a huge story spanning a huge area, you're able to build something much more solid than (what feels to be) the constant improvisation we get with the LW.
---
Also, the way to keep people occupied in MMOs is not a constant stream of "few hours of content every month". A good expansion includes multiple long-term reward systems, which keep you engaged in the same maps for months.
---
We have two clear examples of this philosophy, both coming from ArenaNet themselves:
---
* The Silverwastes and Dry Top both have long term achievements that feel good, and a pretty important aspect, they reward player performance. They also provide decent secondary rewards.
---
* Any GW1 expansion has more content than what we've gotten with HoT and PoF combined so far. Their stories and storytelling are also better, with lot of secondary stories as well (something nonexistent in GW2).
---
More than 100.
---
GvG
---
A.Net expanded lootboxes, they sell dyes in lootboxes, mounts in lootboxes, they have a fake currency that is in place to muddy the prices and prevent having to return change, they bundle items, they continue to remove items from the store to make them artificially scarce, ... Yeah, we REALLY are benefiting!
---
I did mention that the fact the OP was able to hit 18K suggested that the buffs were there, but that maybe the positioning of the other DPS players was bad.  Doesn't matter how well the chrono keeps up quickness and alacrity if the other players don't actually stand in the wells, for instance.  That's why I said there were multiple factors to consider as to WHY dps was bad, and maybe it wasn't all skill.  If a player is still unsure about the mechanics, EVEN IF THEY ARE HITTING THEM like the OP said, they may not be attacking as often as they should.  
---
Your DPS climbs once you are so familiar with the mechanics that you no longer think about doing them, and then you can focus better on maintaining your rotations.  Simply executing mechanics is not the only indicator that you have them down.  DPS while executing mechanics can be.  Either way that can't be determined without going to golem of course, and maybe getting a gear check.  I'm simply pointing out that it's a multi-faceted issue.
---
Added bonus as much as anything else. Maaaaybe in a dedicated top-top tier fractal group, but they're "oh cool" things rather than "we need to set up combos in this fight" things for 99% of the playerbase. 
---
It does sound like a hacker then. Get him on video if you can next time, it sounds like he was using cooldown and teleportation hacks.
---
https://snowcrows.com/ for high-end, raid-focused builds.
---
https://discretize.eu/ for high-end fractal meta build, albeit a little outdated for now (DPS builds are fine though)
---
Generally you can use all these builds for open world PvE, might just want to change some utility skills.
---
But boon uptime is harder to see immediately, unless you configure your add on for it, don't mind the screen clutter and understand the different formats between Arc, GW2 Raidar and dps.report for showing boon output.
---
It is not a metric as obvious as dps which is why we don't get many posts about people feeling bad for calling out poor boon uptimes. 
---
Like that idea
---
yep...i mean you need the expansions anyway, and every episode makes the game that much harder for a new player to get into the game, its an ever growing barrier to entry.
---
Just run a script that takes dictionary words instead of symbols / characters. Add to that an argument that capitalizes the first word automatically. With about 5 minutes of googling you can find someone's native language, their password is in that language. Use those dictionaries as source references in your scripts. Add an argument that filters the dictionary most common words first. Now it will not take 530 years to guess that password at 1000 guesses / second. 
---
&gt;  It's more helpful to newbie raiders to focus on building confidence and mechanical proficiency at first.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; anyone can cross-reference with a boss-timer and current boss HP 
---
And that's where you are wrong. Currently there are 18 raid encounters with different mechanics in the game. The only thing they have in common is your DPS rotation which will be (mostly) the same. Proper DPS will mean less mechanics to wipe to, less mechanics do to and less options to fuck up. 
---
Learning a boss with utter trash DPS will result in a completely different experience than learning a boss with proper DPS rotations. Also at some point you will have to practise both rotations and mechanics. The difference is you can practise your rotation on your own without dragging 9 other players willing to kill the boss down. Practise your class -&gt; practise the boss and you'll actually get the kill.
---
Instead of practising the boss, wiping to dps problems, learning rotations, start a new group with new players who also think learning the boss first is a good idea and keep being trapped in that circle.
---
&gt; Your approach is a bad strategy for dealing with new raiders because it wrecks morale and builds animosity and resentment 
---
If the new raiders can't even invest 10 minutes on getting a basic grasp of their class and rotation before going into 10 man content with 9 others there is nothing to get wrecked. They shouldn't even be in raids in the first place. If telling them they are not fulfilling the role causes animostity and resentment, you exactly hit the problem with new guild wars raiders. They want to be spoonfed everything without even the slightest time investment.
---
I'm the Commander and this the the only guide I use when exploring the fractals of Tyria. 
---
If it comes down to doing maximum damage then your rotation won't have much variety.  Honestly? Excessively min/maxing all of your builds for endgame content is a little bit of a "trap" when it comes to long-term satisfaction and enjoyment of the game.  DPS and damage potential isn't the be-all/end-all in this game; consider whether you find a class satisfying and fun.  Don't be afraid to run some builds for casual open world PvE (eg; D/WH FA Tempest).  
---
All that's asked of DPS in an end-game PvE scenario are 2 things: damage and occasionally, crowd-control (break-bars).  DPS rotations are about eliminating skills that result in DPS-losses; stuff with more of a player vs. player focus or bad damage/cast times, CDs, aftercasts etc. 
---
Engineer tends to have the most variety when it comes to DPS rotation, but it can very much feel like playing the piano.  There are several different builds of varying intensity, but a big part of Engineer DPS revolves around kit-swapping.  You have to learn to manage hidden cooldowns and swap between various Engineering kits for various filler skills.  Condition Engineer/Holosmith especially. 
---
You're typically not going to have realistic boons (25x Might, Fury, Quickness, Alacrity, Regen, Swiftness, Vigor) outside of an endgame Fractal or Raiding context.  So it stands to reason that builds that are designed to operate w/ these boons aren't going to be as fun or satisfying to play outside of their intended game-mode.  Elementalist is pretty awful w/o consistent quickness for example.  
---
Generally speaking the rotations are fairly simple in GW2 because there's a lot of emphasis on mechanical pressure and active responsibility for dodging, blocking, or evading attacks.  You're not always going to be able to execute a perfect rotation.  Stuff is going to interrupt you, phases will happen, and a lot of realistic combat in GW2 is adapting your rotation to hectic situations or doing as best you can to preserve your rotation whilst completing mechanics.   Sometimes mechanics completely RIP your rotation.  It depends =P
---
Please, have you seen [this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Elonian_Elementalist_Outfit)?
---
You can even see the sylvari soul leaving the body.
---
Yeah, I have a similar experience. I know the story is forgettable and that LW isn't that important anyway, so I avoid mentioning that like the plague.
---
Once they're into the game, they will find other reasons to like it, and LW won't be that much of a pain. It's cancerous as a first contact element though.
---
Yeah :)
---
Maybe as banner slave squishing out a 4th F1 in raids
---
Yeah, they won't do that. Not once did they say that there won't be any expansions in the future. Not the first time we have two seasons back to back and if they WERE working on an expansion they'd have no reason to even talk about it yet.
---
Most likely we're going to season 5 because the next expansion isn't even close to being done or they're going for something huge, maybe a full underwater expac with Bubbles and that means more time to get it right.
---
Hence, they want to add expansion quality content with seasons from here on out because they know that two or more seasons without anything BIG would be a let down. It's fine as a palate cleanser but we're already around the time were an expac should be coming.
---
This is an inclusive sub. We include and respect everyone's sense of humor 
---
From start (the sketches) to finish (final paint job), he took around 36 hours, spread out over a few weeks.
---
They need to consolidate a few of the categories because pretty soon we're going to have an over bloated achievements panel due to living world. Same with LFG.
---
&gt;This means that any feature they introduce in one episode won't ever be expanded upon or used in later episodes.
---
Although not really an episode, HoT mechanics were included in Jahai Bluffs (S4E4) with bouncing mushrooms.
---
Likely the 5th of February. Invest now, my fellow traders!
---
I had every single theme since Prophecies up to HoT. It was a nice little surprise every time I logged on.
---
Canthan related 10-man dungeon, maybe?
---
What happens if you click the link that says "Register" in your picture?
---
is the sale still going on?
---
I like the idea of one map lasting 2 or 3 episodes. Ex. Episode one gives you access to the map, but episode 2 and 3 unlock new events, collections, masteries, and maybe even unlock access to a small part of that map that wasn't available before. Would be even cool to see the look of the map progress slightly as the story does.
---
&gt; gear hopefully before we jump into anything pvp/wvw related.
---
You do need gear for WvW, but not for PvP.
---
As for stats, if we're talking Elementalist, that class has never had a viable condition based build in 6+ years of PvP so there's that.
---
For WvW and Dungeons/Fractals it's nice to know a few but not all of them:
---
* Blast a Smoke Field --&gt; Area stealth for you group
---
* Blast a Fire Field --&gt; 3 stacks of might in area for your group
---
* Blast a Water Field --&gt; Area healing for your group
---
* Blast a Light Field --&gt; Area Condi Clean for your group
---
* Blast a Lightning Field --&gt; Area Speed for your group
---
There is but you need to authenticate with a token.
---
gw2timer.com has a gem promotion tab.
---
So i need to clear up my Level-80 boosts, but i like learning how to play classes as i level up. Do Druids (or any elite spec, really) play vastly differently to their base class? That would be the kind of class that i would want to use my boost on
---
Alternatively, is it more worth it to just use the boost on an already existing level 80 character? What kinds of exotic gear do already existing 80s get from the boost? Is it based on profession, like soldiers get heavy, scholars get light, etc?
---
Oh is PVP equalized gear wise?
---
Or you could just explain how it works...
---
Uhm not as much anymore. But sometimes they do actually 
---
? You just bring up the boon table after a fight and have a look.
---
A little bit of everything is a good way of preventing burnout. 
---
Try the T1 daily recommend fractals and see how you get on. Dungeons are fun and I've never had to wait long to get a group together. If you say you're new, people will help you or they'll assume you know the mechanics. 
---
It's worth focussing on crafting for a while so you can unlock the time-gated ectoplasmic refinement items. 
---
I am working on map completion and I'm doing a zone, maybe, whenever they come up in the recommended dailies. Today had a jumping puzzle in Diessa so I finished off the zone after.
---
For the hero point, HoT maps often have "HP trains" on the LFG - lots of players working together to get them unlocked.  
---
HoT can be brutal when you first get into it but push through - I honestly think they're some of the best maps and best metas in the game. 
---
I really like the map per episode format.  For a very long time pre-hot it felt like the gw2 map would never expand at all, or at least not in a meaningful way.  It once felt like the map could never expand far enough to reach areas with other cultures, the whole concept of seeing cantha or elona seemed impossible.    
---
yes
---
I can't access the "shortcut" tab under properties now that the only part of GW I have is the initial down-loader. I can't find any other info on how to change the port without it. 
---
Something like that. 
---
PvP basically exists in a bubble. When you enter the PvP lobby or a game, you're playing an alternate version of your characterwhich is bumped to lvl 80 with all traits/skills unlocked. PvE stats and gear becomes irrelevant, instead you'll get to choose an amulet (these are stat sticks), a rune, and sigils. 90% of them are free and can be changed freely, but some you may have to buy for gold.
---
The official wiki can probably explain it better: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/PvP_Build
---
Each prior release was a least a week from the actual event, so I kinda disbelieve that ANET would change their practice now.
---
He just gave you the most likely setting issue
---
To be fair, at some point last year they said his lunar new year item will be changed from those rare rolls, so it could be something less awful this time (luck sink, for example^pls^anet )
---
Cool thanks, I will check it out later when im home from work. 
---
You can also pin the dailies.
---
Thanks, glad you enjoy &lt;3
---
Whahaha it's a pun I didn't even consider, nice one &lt;3
---
I think she occasionally does route guides as well, but yeah, she's not the best. Sometimes the wiki is also good if someone has a guide on there.
---
What I usually tend to do with item collections like those is:
---
I check out all the possible collections that I can do simultaneously. Then I decide on an area, check where all the collection items are (approximately usually, i get lost easily), and head over. I don't do them in order, i do them so i deal with multiple objectives simultaneously.
---
Might be worth a shot :o
---
Thank you
---
Wow, that would be very generous of you! Thanks!
---
NAH
---
I do casual t4 fractals without potions (im a cheap ass that wants to save that extra relic) as a soulbeast. I dont do perfect damage all the time, still learning, just recently picked up this whole fractal stuff but 5k is just sad. I thought i was a newbie. 5k screams - dont wanna do effort, just carry me. Because that is the amount i do with a  longbow.
---
I have myself some salt about this same issue. I have some friends who sometimes fractal T3 with me. These runs usually suck. And i have the same issue explaining them that their dps is low if they all keep disregarding any meta whatsoever. Yes, ton of meta builds out there are for speedruns and normal human beings should tweak them. But could you just please take effort to at least read it and understand underlyong whys ? There are good reasons why SC or whatever announced it as meta. And no, your wuup wuup shit gear does not work at fractals where by logic you need good burst... *cries*
---
Some people just dont want to learn :(
---
That's why you address it privately and offer help instead of publicly humiliating them.
---
First you lose the minions. Then you grab the Reaper spec. Grab the GM trait that applied on chill. Equip skills that either chill in an AoE or leave an ice field.
---
Reaper 5 leaves an ice field. Then you spin in that with reaper 3 follower by spear 3 and 4 for even more whirl finishers. Then you swap to Trident for the 5th skill. Should put well over 40 bleed stacks on an enemy.
---
But Scourge F1 -&gt; F2 is stronger and much easier to do. A few stacks of Burn and Torment beat a ton of Bleeds.
---
 The last two maps have been very good. I have not finished either the Requiem armor or Dragonsblood weapon yet. They are my long term reward to revisit the region. Story pacing wise, I disagree with you. An old friend recently returned to GW2 and we were doing a story marathon. He was impressed, even how he hates the original story line. 
---
I feel like you just look at GW2 through the nostalgia lens of the original game. I don't even want to do anything with the maps in either Nightfall or Cantha after finishing the story. The only time I come back for them is to do Zaishen bounty or vanquish. The side quests give tiny unrepeatable reward. Do 7 quests in Vabbi to get enough tokens for 1 single ruby? What a waste of time. Farming Nick gifts or anything that matters by zoning the map over and over and repeat the exact routine for 30 minutes straight? Ugh, chore! The only thing that's worth doing after completing GWAMM is solo UW or FoW with henchies. It's a great way to put on a flag "Don't talk to me tonight".
---
I need 10000 
---
This. 
---
There's a completely normal middleground between toxic asshole and sugarcoating that you can strive by merely telling people what they do wrong, and that that's why things aren't proceeding smoothly. If it's DPS, tell them to train on a golem until they're more comfortable with their rotation. If it's mechanics, tell them to stare less at their UI and more at the situation at hand etc.
---
Being rude about it doesn't help though and pretending that everything's fine despite knowing the issue doesn't help either. Politely tell the member what they're doing wrong, and maybe offer help if you can (know their class' dps rotation) and, of course, if you want to. You're not obligated to do so, it's a nice gesture though.
---
how, I'm pretty sure you do around that much damage in lvl 20 gear
---
Gear grind doesn't work here. It's not content. That's just artificial limiting.
---
I haven't done the achievement myself, but you probably have to kill them in a row, without going out of combat. 
---
# BringBacktheWhiteSelectScreen
---
This orange one has terrible lighting.
---
A reason to do guild missions again.
---
The watchlist is a nice solution, but the dailies need to be figured out when utilizing the pin. I would like to see a pin appear with the rest of the stuff I pinned so I can easily access them. I know a lot of people who use the watchlist to keep track of long term achievements and it would be nice to not have to shuffle around. The achievement page seems to be a big part of how Anet pushes us towards content and not that I hate the idea, just the page could use a few minor adjustments.
---
If they're in your watch list you can hover over them to show you the current count.
---
Do you absolutely need this one certain composition of classes to beat a raidboss, or are things like Snowcrows raidcomps just recommendations on how to do them the easiest/best/fastest?
---
Context for those who care: 3 buddies of mine and I are currently playing and leveling, and plan to make/join a guild and get into Fractals and Raiding. One of us has been in a raidingguild before and they were told to use specific classes for specific Raidbosses "because Snowcrows said so". Now I personally know for a fact that metasheep are a thing in every MMO but we've been wondering on how normal that is.
---
And I don't mean "Oh we could use a support/CC build fort his fight" type of attitude but rather "We play *this* composition, or we don't take you along if you don't have this class at max and play it well". Is this absolutely required? Sounds really weird to me coming from other MMOs and I'd rather not need every Metaclass at max just to be allowed to Raid.
---
If it's just "not optimal", that's totally OK with me and my group as we'd rather spec a bit differently on our 1 character per boss than have 1 char per boss. We're not super hardcore, we just wanna kill the bosses and have fun doing so. Thanks in advance.
---
That's a lot of projection and aggression. I hope to never be unlucky enough to be in a raid group with you.
---
I never kitten come back to Dry Top after the Ambrite collection. The only things SW is good for are obsidian shards and stacked magic find to open chests. Other maps also have week long grinds and easy farms as well. So why Dry Top and SW are always "preferred"? let's not forget the content drought period came right after them.
---
Oh not at all. Some skills create fields and some are called finishers. When a finisher hits a field, a secondary effect goes off. That's all a combo is in GW2. 
---
As an example, I have a chronomancer that uses calamity well a bit, which drops an ethereal field, which applies chaos armour to people when they use a finisher. It's a secondary effect but nice when it does go off. You don't have to mash keys in a certain order or do like ⬇️↙️⬅️B to use a skill.
---
Just so you know if you decide to go for Power/Condi Weaver: it's not easy, you need to have quick fingers for the rotations, count attacks, time abilities right and do them in the right order to max your dps. Worth mentioning as well that Weaver is extremely squishy (glass cannon). You may ditch out a lot of damage, but you'll also take a lot.
---
If you plan on playing T4 Fractals with Weaver, you need to learn mechanics, up your reaction times and hope the support/healer is good enough to keep you alive if and when you fuck up.
---
If you wanna practice rotations, spend a few hours training them on Golem.
---
It's been a while since I played, but maybe we should ask a dev on twitter what their thoughts are? I'm sure they could offer some constructive feedback. I've noticed that developers on twitter are usually responsive, so it couldn't hurt. 
---
Try to find an open guild raid where you can join tag and join their comms.  If you like running with them, you can ask if they are recruiting and take things from there.  JQ is dead though, and IMHO, TC isn't very good.  So depending on how you like to play, a server transfer may be in order.
---
They give you token vendor if you're unlucky with the loot box. They sell single unique mounts and mount packs at the same time of the lottery one. They allow players to buy gems with gold. They sell separate items along with a cheaper bundle. They rotate items seasonally (like all the retail stores irl). That's my perspective. We are given choice to pay what we want.
---
You need to understand that Elementalist is a whole different beast. While every class has 2 tabs with 10 skills total, Elementalist has 4 tabs with 5 skills each, giving a total of 20 skills. What makes it harder is that you can MIX both tabs, for example, you're attuned to Air, and you then attune to Fire, you'll get Air - Fire, and then if you attune back to Air, you'll have Fire - Air, and so on. It might be confusing at first but after multiple hours you'll get a feel for it. While attuning and using abilities, you'll have to auto attack, which is when counting auto attacks comes into play, mostly because Air autos deal extra damage every 3rd attack, and you don't want to attune to Fire before getting the 3rd attack 2x out.
---
I haven't played much of Power Tempest, but it is definitely easier than Weaver. Its DPS isn't bad, it can out-DPS a weaver in big hitboxes. Problem is, in prolonged fights, Weaver will out-DPS Tempest by a lot, hence why Weaver is a preferred choice for T4 fractals and raids (that doesn't exclude Power Tempest's viability - it is still very viable even in T4 and Raids.).
---
Yes you are. Message the commander in private about your concerns and let him talk to the group or people in private. It also sounds like a pug training run meaning that the skill variance will be greater.
---
Already done. Look at the legendary earring Aurora.
---
I don't.
---
I see, thanks.
---
Is there a basic framework that you then fill with whatever class you want (Loose example as I have no idea but: 2 Chronos, 2 healers, 1 bannerboi, rest is DPS, think I read that in a guide) and the recommendations are mainly there because those classes deal the most damage on those fights, or do you actually *need* to reroll to an entirely different class if you're only playing one class and that's not part of said framework? Hope that makes sense.
---
I got my gold on my alt accounts ready for adnl envelopes to open :D
---
I just ran through and created a F2P account so it looks like the system is working. For me, at the very least. It looks like your account might not be verified though? Maybe take a look in your spam folder and see if your account verification email from Anet landed there by mistake. If that's not the issue, then I'm not sure what's going on and Support are going to be your best bet.
---
Unless you want them to regurgitate elite specialisations that have the same skills and utilities as we currently have in-game, with just different effects and flavour texts, they have to introduce new mechanics and effects in order to keep them fresh and exciting. A power creep might be circumvented, but the gameplay will definitely change things to such a degree that certain situations might appear as giant power creeps whilst they're not. 
---
Bottom line is, if you want something new and exciting, you have to also accept the bad side of it.
---
About druid healing (in raids): while a lot of it can be done by rotation there are times when you need to save your burst heal capabilities to counter heavy damage pressure or spike. As a healer you can also be required to do immobilizes, projectile destruction or knockbacks and you'll be playing build wars by choosing what skills to take based on what encounter you'll be doing and what kind of team and subgroup you have. 
---
Other players don't use their personal healing skills that much since it is a DPS loss.
---
Raiding is fun even without rewards. It can offer lots of self made goals to spice it up. You might want to learn multiple roles, might want to dps race between guildies or against global dps stats per encounter &amp; build, get to a point where your team can one shot bosses, do achievements, try different strategies on the same boss, try out meme compositions and low mans etc.
---
Sounds like your cpu cores are parked. 
---
Download [this](http://coderbag.com/Programming-C/CPU-core-parking-manager-v3) and if they are parked, enable them. 
---
yeah just sad that anet doesn't want to change their formula, they could do so much more engaging content but they just stick on whatever they doing since LS3 and only 10-20 % of it still keep player interested 
---
When nothing can kill you but you can also kill nothing.
---
I love the map per episode format wish they would do more but smaller maps, as much as I like the story I also want to explore the world.
---
I seem to be in the minority but I honestly believe we're in peak GW2 at the moment, beautiful areas and compelling story with amazing production value at a consistent pace. Didn't care much for Season 2 at all, months of waiting for a few average story steps - it doesn't compare at all to the wonders of last episode and I don't think Dry Top or the Silverwastes can compete with any of the new maps either. 
---
Thanks! Yeah i actually like that elementalist has access to 4 different skill bars and has the mixing mechanic for weaver. Not anywhere close to probably able to do T4 fractals...i havent even touched them yet. So not too worried about that just yet. 
---
Pretty sure I get more damage than that in full magi ...
---
where is any assumption in my last answer? i just mentioning the fact that lots of your points are simply not true and as said i havent inc out of nowhere on anyone. i even take care that ppl can see me around and can see me stealthing if i stealth. and no that is excatly the point not all burst builds are the same just because they all can burst, this build has specific tools and synergies besides the overbuffed dmg on chrono. also its fact that their are a lot of high ranked player in this vid (not that rank means anything in gw2 but when you want to talk about rank we talk about rank). and even the high ranked and infact decent player get outplayed by me using the tools and the synergy of this build in a very fast way make them unable to counter even when dodging some stuff. i also know very well how to precast skills so they hit right in the exact moment a dodge ends so even with double dodging they would get hit. thats the reason even good player can look like easy downed noobs but in fact they arent, they just get outplayed. i also explained to you for what the oneshots are, for simple entertainment and editing purposes and they dont break any limit in appearance in my vid. oneshots are indeed not shown to prove any kind of skill, they are shown because they look cool and entertaining and are good for eding and a fast paced atmosphere. if you would check any comment i pinned under vids you would know that im cleary not a fan of these type of insane dmg oneshot builds, i only made a chrono vid bc it was requested. i normally play a reactive support burst hybrid powermirage build not carried by broken dmg multiplier for some reasons.
---
nope. Always plat 2 -3. Haven’t seen a hacker in a very long time. Maybe I’m lucky, idrk. 
---
The last hacker I recall was a speed hacker that troll tapped keeps and etc. in wvw.
---
Though I do see people throw around many baseless hacker accusations because they don’t understand the game in one way or another. 
---
Yeah, no game in my mind can ever replace GW2.
---
Right now, if you buy the pre-purchase to the upcoming expansion, you get the base game and every other expansion.
---
Its good to have another game to fall back on just so you don't burn out.
---
???
---
The cast time was 3.25 seconds and it roots you in place while being in melee range. This has nothing to do with "too hard". The current cast time is 2 seconds which is way better.
---
Don't know what you want to achieve with your comment.
---
because other players killed it for you
---
I really hope they wont add that 50AP meta for this one,
---
GRONK!
---
So it's just like in other MMOs and my buddy just got into the wrong guild, gotcha. 
---
Thanks, this calms me a bit. I didn't want to have to reroll 9 characters just to be able to raid, and neither did my buddy who was in that guild, it did infact kill his enjoyment of the game as he dislikes having alt-characters quite a lot.
---
And I can absolutely see your last point, I've been in a hardcore guild in Wow back in MoP and I quickly learned that that's not for me. It's demanding, not about having a fun time at all and you it's basically a 2nd job without the payment unless you're professionally playing/streaming I suppose. These days I'd rather raid with people who can play well but also know how to take a joke and have fun doing so. A healthy middleground basically.
---
Have a nice day!
---
From my observation, 90% of players on average meta events spam auto attacks with some inferior builds (if they even have any). Open world really isn't the place where you have to maximize your dps.
---
You think really highly of yourself when you're doing exactly what any competent mesmer roamer would do. Pre casting skills isn't hot shit dude this has been a thing since launch. I never said you were a bad player but man if you think pre casting is a big deal you have a LOT to learn. 
---
&gt;that is until HOT launched and just killed WvW. Was also the time when there was there a replacing of devs.
---
Can you history lesson me on Both of these? I was on a hiatus back then
---
While seeing maps dedicated to show 'the state of the world' would be excellent; a map in which nothing huge (story wise) happens but shows off the people you've interacted with in the last story, and how they've progressed (e.g. Free Awakened versus Loyalists) would have made a great gap-filler map between Kourna and Jahai Bluffs; *dives in rabbithole*  
---
This map could have been Sunward Marches+ Marga Coast and it could have included some of surviving (not-awakened) Inquest from Sandswept Isles; this would have given us a "midway point" between episodes 3 &amp; 4 of Living World; and that's the only way I could see this work; especially with mounts; you can't just justify making a filler map from a financial perspective.
---
 What you are asking for is basically having the "Side Stories" expand into half-fledged maps...
---
-
---
and while I enjoy that idea, what comes to mind is Southsun Cove; a beautiful map that I never go back to because it's *just not worth revisiting*... All the LS3 &amp; LS4 maps have a dedicated currency for me to farm for collections, ascended loot, or overarching currency (volatile/unbound magic); They have a story for my alts to run through; they have skins associated with them; How would you stretch the replayability into these filler maps, would you stretch out the collections to be unfinishable until the filler map, all this means is that people have to log in more and play 'lesser releases' inbetween the story releases...?
---
and about the currencies, would you just give the same currency to these filler maps (e.g. Kournan Caches in Marga Coast? and Kralkatite in Dohjok Quarry?)
---
like I said, I enjoy the idea of getting more maps to explore (I like exploring maps); I can't see this idea work without having to split the existing release-teams; or giving each team less time to work on their story chapter releases... neither of which would benefit the maps *nor* the story...
---
clearly the solution is to hire more intern like the one who did the Secret Lair of the Snowmen Festival Raid; and have mini raids (let's not call them dungeons) be released in those gaps between story releases... reusing existing boss mechanics from the story into small, say 5-man content expeditions into currently uncharted territories to finish loose ends; or complete side narratives.
---
to throw some examples out there:
---
in LS3 they created some more difficult, hard-to-reach areas like The Bitter Cold in BFF and the Centaur area in Lake Doric; but they didn't quite work out, LD is an afk farm and the Bitter Cold is just a dead zone you go into once for the story and PoI). Imagine if those were mini-dungeons; instanced content where you accomplish specific tasks;
---
- The Bitter Cold could be freeing a bunch of Quaggans from being turned into Icebrood.
---
- Watchtower Cliffs could be fighting your way up there to kill the bloodstone corrupted Modniir Sage at the top.
---
- Golemancer's Tomb could be assaulted by Inquest or Destroyers; and you are there defending it for the Priory.
---
for LS4 they could have added zones *outside* the currently playable map; parts of Istan and Elona we currently see on the map but cannot access.
---
- **The Cliffs of Dohjok, West of Istan**; a Labour Work Camp where we go to free prisoners from Joko's lieutenants (invade and free allies)
---
- **The Barbarous Shores, east of Kourna**; a Corsair Haven that Sayida sends us to raid because they've been undermining her authority; (kill everyone)
---
- **Wehhan Terraces, East of Jahai** an Elonian hideout besieged by Branded after Kralkatorrik flew over; (defend a base from waves of enemies)
---
Nothing to do with the game but...I don't think it normal for cats to do that...mine don't. Their bowl is always full. The nibble at it some here and there and they're not fat. I get what you're saying, though. The cat analogy just bugged me haha. 
---
I now have map completion that's why I'm looking at guides. I don't want to look for dozens of others coins and other stuff in crevasses and cliffs, looking around like that makes me sick (literally dizzy).
---
lol discussing with you is so senseless its actually funny, you rly just wanna stay negative and anti no matter what ;) i just descripted why even good player looks like easy downed noobs when facing this build when its played correctly without any rating of how hard it is to play or selfhyping. but you dont even get the specific nature of the build and only get the basic of it being a burst build . but i end the discussion with you now, have the last word when you need it, im out. its sadly a waste of time to talk to you as biased as you act here. lets agree to disagree and we both can move on and use our time for something less senseless. bb o/
---
The hack I remember that's long since patched/banned allowed player invuln, unobstructed projectiles (such as shooting thru doors in WvW), teleport, fly, and an option that added character specific buffs to a class much like the raid training special forces area. 
---
As far as damage, my guard is pretty tanky. Soldier is Power/Vit/Tough. So my HP really isn't all that low. I wasn't marked when it happened. I can understand a high DPS build taking someone down in a few shots but not just 1. 
---
This aligns alot from my experience with fractal runs. Person thinks he performs just fine as he individually has survivability (and that he can generate some boons for himself only... ) , while missing the whole point of fractals - burst damage therefore actually hurting everyone by making plays longer. Have more than one like that and expect to have a bad run :(
---
But you dont have any quickness alacrity there....
---
I did them all and can confirm this :
---
1, focus is bugged
---
2, rifle is bugged if you do "10 kills withotu dmg" before "30 kills"
---
3, axe arent as much as bugged as horibly harder then rest
---
For your question -I did LB without issiue. As Nordlin say, you may need to be in combat for whole 10 kills. Probably esiest is north meta, just stay back and fire fire fire
---
The previous version is a push and hold mechanic. The longer you held the key down, the more powerful the attack was. Like Shockwave from GW1 how the damage decreased based on distance. The same mechanic is still used on some event weapons. One in specific is a ghost capturing event in Plains of Ashford. Skill 5 is a pulsing dmg skills for as long as you hold the key down, up to X seconds. 
---
that's open world minstrel mesmer ;)
---
Frivolous lawsuits should be punishable with public flogging, tarring and feathering.
---
Pretty sure I still find all meta events being done in HoT

If you find a hacker, just record their exploits, and try to spread the news on twitter, reddit, facebook, wherever.
---
Like with previous instances in this game, making a stink and threatening the income is the only way to get *any* kind of quick outcome.
---
Are you a shill or just delusional? 
---
The annual achievement chain? I think they will :o
---
I dont think lunar new year is big enough to have one.

I believe it didnt even have that 10AP for doing daily 5 times achievement

Guild Hall level *rewards* cap at 40. The Guild Hall level itself caps at 69(.85)
---
how's this build for things like champs and hero points where there's not a lot of little things to kill?
---
Fixing Guild History so that you can actually see things instead of "..."  - and make it stop breaking whispers.
---
Exactly this.  When I'm doing a Training run, if I notice a DPS issue that is so egrigious that it is going to impact the success of the run, I'll address it super politely at the time. If its something that we can limp across the finishline with, I'll address it individually afterwards or if with the group as a whole, I'll contextualize it as "Hey, just wanted to go over the run as a whole so we can see where we might want to improve before tackling harder bosses."
---
There is a big difference between "average" dps and ... substandard "you wont beat the content" levels of DPS.  usually when I talk to the latter players, they are using defensive stats, weird trait lines, questionable runes for their build, etc.  Or they have something with their build that makes sense in either PVP/WvW/open world PVE but doesnt in the context of raids or fractals.
---
Its important to politely point these out to the player so they dont get someone raging at them later, and to help them simply become more competent and helpful to their own squads in the future.
---
longbow is tomorrow for me but shortbow has the same type of achievement. for me it only popped after some of the others (kill 30 and apply x conditions). I couldn't seem to get it on soulbeast at all, maybe because of condies, so I swapped to thief, which got it easily after I killed mobs without getting hit even once in between. I did leave combat in-between though, so thats definitely not the issue. so if longbow is the same, I'd say avoid anything with condies (warrior), make sure you never get hit as it probably resets the counter and doesn't just skip it for that single mob and try to do the other achieves first.
---
some of these things seem really buggy, I still don't have the 4 axe kills within 20 seconds, despite having done that multiple times (not even sure what they mean with sequentially, I used necro to make sure I only damaged one enemy at a time and still never got it).
---
with a patch hinted at for other stuff (purple plate) on Tuesday, I'd say if you can't seem to get it yet, wait till then, they might have a fix for the more unreliable stuff.
---
noooo! bad reddit! this is fluff not a request!
---
100% agree. Istan was not designed to be played the way it is. Everything from the limited loot tables to the graphical clusterfuck that amala fights are to the struggle to tag champions on anything but an engineer... Amala looks like the epic boss fight that needs some strategy and Pala the big event that's meant to take a relatively long time to do with a couple small groups working at the same time. Instead we got a complete mess.
---
Since you really want to be revied... Promoting or (god forbid) playing builds like this you contribute nothing... no... you contribute negatively to the society. You promote not only effortless gameplay but also being a leech while profitting on other players efforts.
---
You sound like a decent person, but being nice is not helpful by definition. To compare, let's look and NikeDMZ. He's a scum, but at least his open world builds are supposed to help other players complete their open world events. Your build has no positive impact. It's even worse, because it contributes negatively.
---
Cooldown is a gameplay mechanism that can't be directly translated to the lore. But if you want to go by that, Chronotank is proof that heavy armors are not that useful :D
---
Magic is an environmental energy in GW2, it's not some sort of energy from within like Ki/Mana.
---
We're at a peak of magic availability. With the death of some Elder Dragons, the world is slowly shattering because of the excess of magic.
---
Rata Sum proves that we can have long lasting magic, it's a floating city. And we found golems that are still working after so many years after their creator death that they're considered archeological discoveries.
---
Staff is slightly behind sword/dagger but it's not bad by any means. 
---
The meta power build for weaver constantly switches between fire, air and water; that person using only fire to stack burns is using a weird build.
---
As I expected, you are empty.
---
The other person pretty much explained entirely, just to add, the gear you get from level 80 boost is based on profession but you shouldn't use level 80 boost just for exotics because the exotics you get are far from optimal, like if you boost a warrior to level 80 then you get exotic gear with soldier stats, which is pretty much useless. Neither can you sell, salvage or throw them in mystic forge to get something else which can be used.
---
I mean, you *did* request that someone take your computer away, so... 
---
No, it's a fitting quote for someone who thinks everyone else needs to hear a shitty hot take that has 1) no constructive criticism and 2) reeks of entitlement, e.g. 'how dare anet have *something* I'm not forced to play!'
---
Dragon Ball Arena again. Snores.
---
Drooburt. ;-;
---
you are weak!
---
Holy crap I love this! All the scales must've been agony to go through
---
Your work is very well painted. Great job, and I'm also glad it didn't wind up as a risky click, either. :P
---
is Gandara really so toxic?
---
It depends on team comp, I'd say. If you have a healer in the comp, esp druid, power holo is pretty powerful. Without a dedicated healer, the dot from overheating gets a bit unmanageable.
---
If you don't have a dedicated healer, power soulbeast is better, although still risky, since you have two 10% modifiers dependent on being over 90% health.
---
That said, Power soulbeast is also really strong with a dedicated healer. If you don't have a druid in the group, you can take frost spirit too, which is great.
---
In summary: Power Soulbeast fits most, if not all comps. Power holo works best if there's a healer, but it's still really good.
---
Play what you like best!
---
is there an easy/cheap way to trade off a little of the durability for speed when desired? or would it require a whole new build?
---
My assumption, and speculation: a lot of pug groups can't really CC all that well, which will impact your DPS quite a bit on Power Soulbeast as you rely entirely on Sic Em to have decent burst. If the bar isn't broken and you've used Sic Em, well, say goodbye to a lot of extra damage you could have done. 
---
You can, but you have to type each password in... I would never type an active password into the site though

Does it come with a dwarven decoder plate as a prize?
---
As soon as someone says they run soldiers gear its safe to assume a lack of game knowledge. 
---
I had the same issue. Changed my resolution settings to windowed full screen and my next run worked. Not sure if coincidence. Ymmv.
---
I agree. I understand why the brand stuff is there but it gets tiring to look at. Unlike the core game or even earlier PoF maps, I don't feel like this current map feels very "explorable"
---
Can someone give me any tips for "Hold the Line" achievement? I'm playing Warrior and the third wave just explodes me instantly.
---
Is there a list of items that cannot be used in the Mystic Forge? For instance, I am trying to Forge 4 exotic swords that were in inventory and only three  of them show up when I F the Forge. The absent one is the Weaver's Sword. I can salvage it but would rather Forge it if possible.
---
Is your monitor 60hz and you are running over 60 fps? That might cause an odd effect that looks like your screen is tearing when in fact gpu is pumping out more frames that monitor can display per second. If thats so try limiting frames.

Side note, but Kralkatorrik is so menacing looking. Glad we finally have a dragon-looking elder dragon.

Deadeye
---
"properly" designed like istan farming where there's a race to get into the loot table.
---
The lounge is worse than the ones on the gemstore because of the long load times; I just use a city portal scroll instead.
---
There's a ton of outfits in the store, and quite a lot of earnable skins which are the real fashion endgame.
---
Keep in mind you'll be able to upgrade to the "middle" edition with gems/gold later, which means you can even catch that upgrade on sale.
---
Deadeye, necro or chrono (Boon chrono for fracs and raids)
---
That's another thing: I think HoT was step in right direction. I honestly thought next expansion will improve upon HoT event design, so I was very disappointed with PoF in that aspect. What HoT needed was more event chains per outpost (not just one) and shorter downtime before you could try event again.
---
You're not in the wrong. This is one of the reasons I prefer to raid with my guild/friends. It's good to be comfortable and honest with folks when you're working together on a challenging problem. Most of the time our focus is on learning mechanics. We've been fortunate enough to have enough group DPS to beat enrage timers lately, but it wasn't like that at first. We pointed this out and everyone made an effort to get better. It worked.
---
I just use the Gleam of Sentience from the start of the Aurora collection and ignore the others I have, since it gobbles 300 of each material every day. 
---
Are you doing it alone? There are definitely some achievements that are easier done with others. Put it in the LFG, wait by the instance entrance and announce it on map chat and you'll probably get a couple of people to try it with. 
---
Stout Shako for 2 refined
---
core guardian 
---
Nope, you would sacrifice a lot of sustain for a small dps gain. Rather go with completely different build then:-)
---
I go for the ones I can complete quickly, while doing a little on the side to progress my long-term goals. IMO, you should:
---
=
---
1. Get the skimmer (it's really easy)
---
2. Get the jackal (only 20 gold and really easy as well, beyond the price)
---
3. PoF map completion while doing 1 and 2, plus obtaining hero points
---
4. Go back to HoT and do the story plus map completion while leveling your masteries, maybe do LS S3
---
5. Finish PoF story
---
On the side, you can do dungeons or fractals when you feel like it to get gold for crafting,  plus core map completion.
---
Thanks &lt;3
---
Sure, the way I phrased it is over the top, but it's meant to be. The base message of not saying "your dmg sucks" but instead "next we'll work on our dmg" should still be clear.
---
Thank you:-)
---
If you have path of Fire I would recommend mirage, its very good in open world (has high mobility and evasion), very good single target damage in raids, and is one of the top picks in spvp, and wvw roaming. Mirage also has a low skill floor but high skill ceiling. So plenty to learn on the class but not to the point its frustrating. If you are a HoT only I would look at daredevil, they are glass cannon so open world might be a pain but they are a good starter class for raids and very good roamers in wvw and spvp. 
---
I also love the evades on GS auto, GS 3, and Sw 3.  Because it's so nice to be able to use those to damage and dodge at the same time at points where you basically have to dodge.  Stuff like the final boss of 99 CM's slam attacks, for example.
---
Sadly, healing in Guild Wars 2 does not work that way. I was speaking with my partner (both of us raiders and healers from TBC to WoD, my partner now mains a Tempest healer) about how satisfying making clutch heals were or getting off that perfect Power Word: Shield or making a smart play with Lifebloom ticking off and just feeling liked you'd make a great call. Same with timing Innervates or Hymn of Hope. WoW gave you so many good moments like that.
---
Guild Wars 2 does not have that when it comes to healing. 
---
What causes this? Can I do something about it?
---
Dont transfer on players badly designed events from anet
---
Just like a chocolate brandshake, only crunchy
---
Its anets fault, not players.
---
Easy to set up, takes a few seconds for the full swap as it has to do it all one at a time with a minor delay. Swaps all gear and traits (works with legendary stats, runes, sigils, etc). Only minor issues is sometimes it will try to equip a weapon before the spec switches over or fail to swap out a weapon if it swaps too fast but it doesn't happen often. Also if you change any item (skin, sigil, stats, etc) it will need to be saved in the loadout again since it isn't the same as before.
---
Power does not increase condition damage.
---
And most "power" builds focus on power (direct damage), precision (crit chance, all direct hits can crit unless stated otherwise, condis cannot crit) and ferocity (crit damage). These three stats synergize extremely well with each other as they stack multiplicatively. More "base power" means stronger crits, more crit damage is also amplified by more power. You get the point.
---
Perhaps the name of the builds are misleading. When people refer to power builds they mean direct damage builds that use mainly power, precision, ferocity. Condi builds use condition damage and expertise (increases the durations of conditions) with minor power and precision. Why power on condi builds? Because what else could you get? Defensive stats will always be suboptimal assuming you use your active defenses correctly. Support/healing stats are worthless for obvious reasons. Therefore you wanr more damage which you get from power, precision and ferocity.
---
I stopped caring about the living world a long time ago. I used to really looking forward to every episode back in season one and two but then I just got tired of the whole concept. I only go back and play the story whenever there’s a new expansion. You are right the one map per episode thing feels very very forced.
---
What you can expect- No answer to a credible luck sink
---
They can't even tell you how many times they've lived through this day. Some of these humans are starting to wonder if they'll ever even be allowed to truly die - if they'll ever be able to [deliver Twitchy Jake's message to the world beyond](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/73ceim/spoilers_finally_fulfilled_this_deathbed_request/).
---
Thanks for the explanation, surprised they dont let conditions crit as I figured everything could. Also good to know conditions dont gain damage from power. I need to completely change one of my builds lol. 
---
Where have you been? Festivals have been automatic for 2 years now they don't need a patch to activate or deactivate them anymore. They could put new stuff into the game today and activate it next week.
---
The waves should only follow up once the previous one is completely defeated, so you should be able to hold back on wave 3 by leaving a few of wave 2 alive. 
---
Alternatively, you could cheese it through stealth items like [Ash Legion spy kits](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ash_Legion_Spy_Kit).
---
GvG and capes.
---
Soulbeast has higher damage and also better burst, can bring Frost Spirit once you're good enough to skip the druid, and can bring Moment of Clarity for more single target CC. Soulbeast can also skip a little better than Holosmith, but that is usually done on a class with a teleport. All of this is really important in optimized groups. However, dying may punish you more than on other classes since it makes you exit the Beast Mode while putting it on CD.
---
Holosmith has AoE blinds in case you're missing an Ele, Vulnerability in case you're missing a Guardian (though Soulbeast could take a Storm Spirit for that, too, albeit a little slower), lots of AoE hard and soft CC in case you don't trust your Chrono or you don't have one. And, of course, it can reskill to scrapper for longer stealth durations with a sneak gyro if your group cannot blast very well or is too slow for the maximum stealth durations at certain skips (this point is quite minor since both Holosmith and Soulbeast can provide smoke fields and a few blasts). It can fill in if your comp is lackluster, but all of those roles it performs are basically subpar to the classes dedicated to it. Dying resets your heat meter which can be a good or a bad thing depending on where you were in a rotation.
---
It strongly depends on where you want to go with your fractals. If you want to go fully into that with players you trust are doing their job, go Soulbeast. If you are not, decide for yourself. Holosmith can carry a pug (or inexperienced friends), but if that pug is good at what they're doing, you'd probably do better on Soulbeast.
---
[Modified Leafblower](https://i.imgur.com/EtzAZZI.jpg).  He's faaaaaabulous.
---
There is an area in the Aerodrome called the Special Forces Training Area. You can spawn golems there, add buffs to yourself and test, no need to go to PvP anymore (especially since the numbers may be different)
---
I just read your 2 comments and yeah I guess I'm just going to stick to DPS then haha. 
---
The content looks really fun indeed so I'm looking forward to try the more callenging parts of it now that I know a little bit more about how it works :)
---
If you’re looking to start dipping you toes into raiding, I would suggest some of the raid training discords. I’ve used RiT for the past couple of months and the trainers there have been great. Other than for some certain bosses that require a specific role (I.e pusher Druid) all the trainers seem to not worry so much about comp, but about mechanics. Check here for the links to the channels https://snowcrows.com/raids/training/ 
---
Hmm, sorry. Didn't realize. 
---
I will be attempting it soon it looks like and the most successful thing seems to be to hide round the opposite side of the room letting Anise kill everyone and rez the NPCs when you are safe to do so. Like if it were a clock, when they're at 12, try to be at 6 and stay out of the line of fire. Apparently resurrecting the NPCs will stop Anise from coming near you. 
---
One thing has nothing to do with the other.
---
You could farm influence for all guilds at the same time for all we care.
---
Yea I have and I played gw1 too but still wasn’t a fan of that armor plus I don’t like when my chr shows a lot of skin hahaha I like armor OR all black assassin hahaha 
---
😂😂 
---
If your issue is framerate, this game doesn't run well in general. 
---
I would of thought KralkoCoa Pops ;)
---
The point is that your argument doesn't serve any purpose here because what matters are the events that exist not your hypothetical ideal.
---
An integrated calendar with events you can sign up for and in-game reminders would really help build communities.  Trying to send people off-game for that stuff doesn't work
---
Plus, the camera makes a slight up and down movement as if you character was telling her "good job, do what you have to do now".
---
God I wish that were me.
---
You can do it another way, game key is just one way to prove your account ownership
---
He looks really cute :D How big is he?
---
No, because what matters is completing the event. Prolonging event completion to farm loot is against event basic design and puts event completion at risk.
---
Love how much thought you have put into your characters, just for the record Agent Incus IS cute!
---
&gt;crafting 
---
The crafting system is miles ahead of GW2, just saying.
---
This is the correct answer. Get gw2taco, get all the appriopriate marker packs, and then you have an ingame, 3d guided tour of every damn thing you can think of. 
---
What about difluorite ?
---
So it sounds like you're now trying to install and not just run the game.  [Try this page](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/230665807-Problems-Downloading-or-Patching), it has a section addressing your problem.
---
I'd like it to scale better for smaller guilds.  1-6 person guilds really suffer with the current system
---
Very well done !
---
I wish i had your skills. Design is great stories are well written. Really well done. :)
---
[deleted]
---
Depends on your perspective.  I think farming the THK or Oil-Rig meta is just as tedious.  Nothing changes and you have to do it for what..? 2, 3 weeks for Dragonsblood weapon set? Joy. 
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
Counter point... the constant demands from some players that everything in video games be perfect, and no compromises be made to any part of the product, while still delivering fresh content at whatever unsustainable pace they deem necessary, do not contribute anything positive to the player-developer dynamic, and probably just make things worse.
---
no human female
---
Any new leving story reward track is good due to the volatile magic. 
---
The profit of pvp reward tracks is bery limited tho. If you go for a reward track with exlusive pvp skins you wont miss out on a lot of gold.
---
No, it does not. That's why I suggested entering PVP. It's sufficient for getting a rough feel for the spec without much investment.
---
Everyone "has" reddit.  It's just a webpage.  Not everyone chooses to use it, however.
---
Axe one kill 5 in 5 mins while under 10% health is also an issue. Doesn't say it has to be done in Thunderhead but I've done it 3 times outside of the map and it didn't trigger. Either buggy or misslabeled
---
For some reasons not really anticipated this one, I found lunar year to be the most boring and limited festival and it is gonna be in Divinity Reach again , which is nothing new... Well I guess wintersdays are still my favorite, even if not perfect at least there is some variety to do daily. Well don't want to sound demanding but wish there would be more variety and they would change sth this year or ass some new activities or events.
---
&gt; please stop making everything branded
---
Couldn't agree more. Fuck those branded and their crystal crashing attack sounds and half of the map shrouded in purple. Enough with this madness.
---
Excellent other points as well.
---
I haven’t farmed for volatile magic before what do I do with it?
---
Go with scepter.  Both DH and FB use it, just differing stats.  You can always do the HoT story on multiple characters for more weapons.  I like both DH and FB gameplay wise, so their is no harm trying both or having both options available.
---
The idea is that it can apply ~15 stacks in a single combo. I should've been more precise with this but once again, it was a rant and it wasn't structured. 
---
Indeed.
---
A mystical magic. My bet on this.
---
Mesmer has everything you need, you can play a variety of builds in pve, all in high demand and you are also very potent in pvp, with easy builds like the cancer mirage.
---
Trust me you will soon be swimming in them
---
This is amazing. How much time did it take you altogether?
---
Maybe some improvements to dragon ball, or a new event? It seems like a much smaller event, so it needs it more than others even. A dungeon to match ascent to madness and secret lair of the snowmen would be nice. Or an endless farming place like the labyrinth 
---
Which side? Haha
---
Joko Puffs is my breakfast cereal of choice. I'm loco for Joko puffs. 
---
 
---
&gt; That's why GW2's lore feels like Marvel superhero movie elements mixed in with Jojo's Bizarre Adventures storytelling.
---
You thought you were the hero.
---
**But it was me, Trahearne!**
---
But the less casual the group, the more your job is to squeeze the absolute max dps out of your "support" or "tank" role. It's less WoW healer, using nothing but heals 90% of the time and more like FFXIV healers, who heal when needed and otherwise need to do as much dps as they can.
---
I've been playing both a lot recently in fractals (including CMs) and while I do enjoy soulbeast more, I think holo is more useful in pug situations apart from the soulbeast's ability to provide group stability and its ability to double up its boons (great when you have bad boons).
---
Holo falls behind DHs etc. in well organized groups because your rotation doesn't sync well enough with high dps groups but as soon as you have pugs who are a bit slow, don't have a lot of cleave and/or don't cc, holo shines.
---
Generally, fractals are all about bursting hard and therefore I'd stay clear of holo variants that compromise on the burst (sword etc.) but to each their own. For soulbeast, I quite enjoy sharing stances and adapting to what the group needs but it's usually an effective dps loss coz most pugs don't do a lot of damage in the first place. I believe I enjoy soulbeast more coz ranger is my main and because it is volatile, hitting that sweet 60k burst can be amazing but missing the timing can be extremely frustrating. Holo is just consistently decent and I've played it for too long.
---
Which glyphs do you recommend?
---
thanks :) I recently came back to the game and have been playing my necro due to the high tankyness and good aoe (carrion reaper), always looking for another prof that can do similar things
---
There are some cases where it's true.
---
Precision is worthless if you reach 100% Critical chance (and it's really easy with Fury, Spotter, Banner of Discipline, and some traits)  
---
Ferocity is worth less than Power if you reach 200% Critical damage (or less if you don't have 100% Critical chance). Berserker gear bring you above 200% Critical damage.
---
Either bosses are better dealt with direct damage or condition, and Viper gear still give Power and Precision, so you don't lose much direct damage. (With Scholar Rune &amp; Assassin's Presence, you would still have 185% Critical Damage).
---
This makes me cringe, reminds me too much of [this monstrosity](https://i.imgur.com/2gOZHES.jpg). 
---
PvP was a major feature from the very start, as it was in the first game
---
its why the franchise is called "Guild Wars"....
---
the hell you talking about?
---
That's not what I said?
---
Imo FF14 has a more in-depth crafting system, with specific skills and gear for it, which makes it engaging. Not like the "craft this 1000x k thx bye" of GW2.
---
Thanks for the info! Glad to see how helpful the community is. 
---
Hah! Well, I tried to make sure none of them were "Nothin personnel... kid" levels. I think there's a distinct difference between having fun with your characters and going "this character is the most overpowered edgelord boy in the world and his village killed his family and he swore vengeance &gt;:)"
---
Appreciate the comment nonetheless. 
---
Nice relaxing video, but it doesn't really explain why I need to invest in home nodes...
---
All I see are a lot of expensive nodes that will take years to pay back solely from their loot.
---
Nodes for LS maps are OK I guess, that way you get a daily income of map currency without going to the map or participating in events. They have their purpose, looting annoying currencies like Blood Rubies is a good one, but the 10k unbound/volatile + 50g really makes it hard to warrant a purchase.
---
Might as well do a daily run of mat farm. It basically costs nothing other than WP fees and brings in a decent amount of gold.
---
I could easily make it into a template at some point, but you'd have to open it with Photoshop. A big part of what makes the design work imo is the coloring inside the borders, so using layer masks is pretty important.
---
I do agree with you, however I've lived in 3 different countries, owned 3 new PCs and moved house 7 times since I originally bought the game. It's long gone.
---
I like how your account is 13 days old and every single comment has negative downvotes. You must be such a great person to be around.
---
Were you able to figure out how to fix it?
---
You have no way of declaring one way or another, even if you try to push anecdotal evidence.
---
&gt;Which is really damning, because story missions are pretty much "play once and forget" experiences, which don't belong in MMOs. What GW2 needs is repeatable social content.
---
The missions don't have to be forgettable and I'm not sure why they are in this game considering I really liked how GW1 did theirs, with a main objective and an optional side quest, plus a hard mode. I remember running missions with guildies all the time so we could get the titles or just helping new players.
---
You can only obtain mounts in the expansion Path of Fire, but once you have them unlocked, you are able to use them whereever you wish, including the core maps.
---
Same thing with gliding, though this feature is only obtainable in the expansion Heart of Thorns.
---
No problem and I agree. :)
---
Well it's way too complicated for me to care about or learn so I got a mesmer port to get map completion and will completely ignore the existence of the rooms going forward so mission accomplished if that was the design intent. 
---
Nice one!
---
As a returning player I am looking at the game and feel like it's a daunting task to even figure out what to do and how to do it. Having figured out the winterberries and getting an easy ascended ring. Think that weapon is probably harder. Good job! ^^
---
How viable are thieves now are endgame content (fractals/raids).  I remember back when I played, they weren't really all that great.
---
How i completed this achievement was (worked for rifle and longbow, so assume also for shortbow) killing branded fish while standing on the ice. no risk of damage there. Have done shortbow during a meta, but struggled with the other weapons, to many way to receive damage as it's also no damage between the kills.
---
Or they know what moderation is and are happy to give everyone what they want. People who want hardcore grind can farm HOT. People who just want to blow their lunch money on rabbit costumes and RP incels in the desert can do so.
---
PvP, wvw and many other features of the game have been neglected for a long time. Look at pof and all releases since. 
---
 The community repeatedly asked for these to be ignored in favour of ls. Yet ls alone isn't sustainable.
---
"With REAL BRANDED CRYSTALS inside!"  
---
I wonder what's the taste of Kralkatorrik.  
---
2g/day from 2689g worth of nodes (not including LS nodes, BL contracts, or achievement upgrades) sounds like a horrible tradeoff.
---
I love this type of humor, I made [this](https://imgur.com/a/KP13kdB) back in the height of 'Vaniila' World of Warcraft.
---
I think that's one problem I have with live service-type games... sometimes, when I come back to a game trying to get up to speed is very daunting. I'm just lucky there are tons of resources for GW2 players.
---
Speaking of which... I should probably work on the trinkets on my Holo too. Hahahha!
---
I see, what i meant to ask was: will i constantly see other players running around on mounts? because this would pretty much ruin my experience
---
Then you should be starting threads and petitioning players to join you to redesign many aspects of GW2 so Anet will take notice of you.
---
You spending your energy on a player's build when  "Its anets fault, not players." is misguided.  If you feel the need to "fix" players, start up website and guild like SC.  That, along with "meta" builds, have their own problems, but that's another discussion.
---
&gt; If the armour is thick enough, engraving the surface really doesn't make any noticeable difference.
---
There is no historic presence that I'm aware of where armour was so thin that engraving would make a difference.
---
&gt;  bling armour was usually reserved for representative purposes, while combat armor was usually less extravagant
---
The idea that a rich individual would have two sets of armor, one for just looking fancy and then having another set for real combat doesn't really convince me. That they might use a second set for training, sure. But for actual battle, not convincing. That's like saying you buy a Lamborghini and don't use it for driving, and only to show off and use a second, cheaper one to drive.
---
Many fancy armor from history have dings and scratches which show sign of use. Many also don't, but then the kings and emperors aren't exactly front line infantry.
---
I find little reason to a representative-only armor to exist. Like when does a scenario occur where you should wear armor, but not related to battle? You don't exactly walk around the court in a suit of armor. Only time appropriate to wear is for battle, and you're not going to switch armor between rallying the troops and riding to battle.
---
Unless you can show me a strong evidence otherwise, I find it hard to believe.
---
If we move to cantha I certaintly would drop the magic theme and go for currencies :D 
---
HoT fucking wrecked my shit. Perma-stunning frogs, bursting Smokescales, projectiles everywhere. Really forced me to dance.
---
Mounts and I'm one of those that"why we have waypoints" actually made core maps a fresh taste if not even better. Hell its not uncommon to see people say  mounts made the Heart of thorns maps actually far better. 
---
It's quite simple, and doesn't require understanding the full 'rotation' described up top.
---
You get the two halves of a plate from the top and bottom meta events.  Combined, they'll take you to the first door of the day.  No extra knowledge needed from there.
---
Last year's achievement setup was really bad, and not akin to Wintersday/Halloween. They need to improve that before just slapping on the annual meta.
---
I find it weird that your Sylvari don't really like other Sylvari. :P Aidan is really handsome, btw. Good job!
---
Or a little over 3.5 years to make the gold back.
---
Like a personal Aurene chamber lol.
---
Queensdale was made long before anything that came with PoF was even considered (probably). 
---
You're right, there's fewer events in crystal oasis, However,  it offers more of other stuff queensdale doesn't have. 
---
There's chest runs, however viable they might be, there's bounties that are basically smaller world bosses if you will, of which queensdale basically only has 1 (RIP champ train). 
---
The exploration is just straight up different, maps need to be larger now due to mounts, which let us traverse these large maps alot faster. There's also alot more to explore on different levels, queensdale is basically flat.
---
The game simply has evolved over the years. Whether you like the direction of which the game is going is up to you, I enjoy both old and new maps. What's definitely bothering me is that the visual vomit during bigger events seems to increase with each episode, but that's another topic.

When you created your account, did you go from the main gw2 homepage?
---
This: https://www.guildwars2.com/en/
---
Then you would click on that box that says “Play for Free” which sends you to this page:
---
https://account.arena.net/register?alt=gw2&amp;cid=93:5::::Global:40:::
---
Then you put in all your detais, it generates that myaccountname.2754 thing and it should be done.
---
Have you verified your account? I think it sends an email and wont let you login till you confirm its the right email. Make sure to check your email.
---
Damn! Im jealous
---
Not sure why you're getting downvoted. It \*is\* the worst festival, it's a barebones festival than never got the attention it needed.
---
Hell, it never even got its own [release page](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/the-game/releases/) unlike the others, even SAB and Festival of the Four Winds did.
---
~~ORANGE MAN~~ BALTHAZAR BAD
---
I'll be watching for it, cause the raptor is phenomenal!
---
I see, but it wouldn't be the same for me anymore
---
Obviously because Aurene's not wearing any clothes.
---
Does it come with an aurene as a prize? 
---
There's a difference between harping on DPS numbers and informing people that, if they jump in a real raid, thinking that they know the mechanics and can handle it, but do 5k dps, they will be kicked. I don't know which one of the above occurred during this training run, but new players should be informed on what they have to do to become part of the acceptable pug community, and that involves having at least 50% benchmark dps in my experience.
---
It does work on those patches you get via Black Lion Garden Plot Deed.
---
The gear that matters:
---
Exotic - easy to grab though tp or with dungeon tockens
---
Ascended - though crafting. with map currency from lw3/lw4 maps. Though Fractals or raids. Sort of easy to get to quite expensive depends how fast you want it and how much gold you want to spend.
---
Legendary - though crafting (very expensive)
---
The only viable scrapper build (except secondary healer).
---
Yes anyone complaining should have started 3.5 years ago. It's def worth it now.
---
Nice!
---
Thought, Shouldn't you put "fractal zero to fractal god"? :D
---
For casual end-game, you can use Exotic. If you intend on doing end-game fractals, ascended is recommended and provides an overall 5% stat increase over Exotic. Legendary equipment does not provide any form of stat increase, but lets you swap stat/runes/sigils at will.

I love how you put much thought to the background and creation of each of your toons.
---
My favorite would have to be Archivist Drekk.
---
What are those symbols below their names though?
---
Also this reminds me of my own collection [here](https://imgur.com/a/vlUBee3).
---
To be honest it mightttt stem from my own dislike for Sylvari? The early-game VA work for them sounds too innocent and weak, and the entire idea of plant/nature people doesn't really hook me in as much. But, they do have some really good designs and I wanted to at least try to make a Sylvari, so I've generally stuck with an 'outsider' kinda shtick for them.
---
Thank you for the complements! 
---
knowing anet, they'll probably be outfits instead of armor skins
---
Human females, lol the character model for a human male still looks weird , a Sylvari males character mode looks much better :) imo no matter what I put in my human male he always walks weird  
---
Male asura is my favorite as well. Close your eyes, listen to it and it's very recognizable. Shame that female asura isn't as good, even some quaggan voices from S3 would fit my main better. I feel like the voice actress herself is nice but she's been given bad directions
---
Thank you so much! :D
---
Yes, I try to (for the most part) keep my characters lore-appropriate. I don't usually do this with my games but Guild Wars 2 is something I'm very addicted to and I really like that it gives us the Firstname Lastname arrangement to play around with. Plus Asura are just... awesome!
---
I don't think "fuck them" to people taking things they shouldn't personally. It's just that I don't want to treat people like children or else they'll always continue to act like children, whereas if you treat them like an adult they have the chance to act like an adult.
---
Is there a way to find out what date a character was created? 
---
i understand that, but for me it would be a slap in the face, just like when they made all core builds unviable in pvp
---

---
Thanks!
---
So when I create these character alts, I create them with the focus of having one character for every specialization. Some of them are extras that I haven't nailed a specialization for yet. Demonologist is a type of class I REALLY hope they do in the future (an elementist focused on summoning creatures), and Halgeir is probably going to be a Berserker to replace Mutoh when they release the new specs. 
---
No, but some people play content they don't enjoy just to grind gold to buy a specific thing that they want.  So it's a distraction alternative for them?  All I was saying was it's a nice infusion of cash for anyone who wants to make use of it.
---
Gameplay is about fun and fun is defined/derived by each individual.  Neither you nor I can say what is and is not fun for any other individual.

Ground punch is the best.

I found the symbols via the GW2 Wiki. They have really offputting borders around them, so what I did was:
---
* Set the entire symbol to white with a white overlay.
---
* Making a selection out of the symbol by control clicking the layer window.
---
* Select &gt; Modify &gt; Contract, probably between 1-5px.
---
* Invert selection.
---
* Press Delete on your keyboard, which should remove the trim.
---
Alternatively you could use the pen tool to recreate them, which I do sometimes, but I was too lazy for this project.
---
As for the HowTo, I could explain the process pretty easily right here:
---
* For screenshots, GW2 has a bunch of settings that control your camera, including vertical position, horizontal position, Field of Views and more. Try playing around with and without postprocessing and different shader/shadow levels. Use Image&gt;Adjustments&gt;Levels, or Brightness/Contrast, or Curves, or other adjustments to get the coloring/contrast just right. 
---
* The bars for content are actually kinda sneaky-cheaty. GW2 offers Asset kits - https://www.guildwars2.com/en/media/asset-kit/ - that actually contain several of the brush stroke graphics the game uses. Combine them and size them down to recreate the borders I made. 
---
* For inside the bars, if you alt+click on the area between two layers, you'll create a layer mask. Put textures (like grunge, paint, or other colors) inside the layer mask. Use color adjustments, levels, and overlays to get the color right. You can also use bevel/emboss for the grungy, tech look, or outer glows for everything else.
---
* The type arrangement is justified for the backstory and left/right alignment for the rest. You can modify this in the Window&gt;Paragraph window. The Krytan font is in the asset kit I linked above.
---
If enough people ask me to actually make a how-to video I can! It's not too hard to follow. 
---
How many mirages have you seen in the world, though? Weavers? Firebrands? I could go on and on, but I'll make my point by actually trying to integrate them properly:
---
* **Weaver:** Some powerful djinn have learned to fuse in order to harness two elements at once. Mortals serve them for a few years in exchange of their knowledge. For example, when an air and earth djinn fuse, the result is a sand djinn, with eight arms instead of four.
---
* **Mirage:** Theater artists from Amnoon City. Their ancestors fled Vabbi when Joko invaded it. They perform in the streets, often mocking the undead empire. They bring hope and joy to the people of Elona.
---
* **Scourge:** Awakened and loyalist spellcasters use this magic instead of common necromancy. The sands of the Desolation contain high quantities of bone dust, making it ideal for their arts.
---
* **Holosmith:** Their holo-technology is present at Amnoon (cyberpunk Amnoon anyone?). Few of them can be found around Amnoon and Augury Rock. their technology was developed in collaboration with a small community of asura, whose ancestors came to the desert looking for Ascension.
---
* **Soulbeast:** Found across the tribes of the Desert Highlands, both among humans and ogres. Arts taught by an ancient nature spirit, once revered by the now-extinct centaurs, which is also connected to the choya.
---
* **Deadeye:** They represent the bounty hunters of the Crystal Desert. Few of them can be found gambling at the casino. Most of them have contacts with the Order of Shadows.
---
* **Firebrand:** Librarian-warriors devoted to Kormir. They defend ancient lore and spirits against Joko's minions, in order to preserve the truth.
---
* **Renegade:** Olmakhan adventurers present across the Crystal Desert. They're friends with those outside Joko's empire, and fancy helping them against the awakened.
---
* **Spellbreaker:** Ex-Sunspears working as neutral mercenaries. They focus on the smaller threats instead of trying to dethrone Joko, who tolerates them because they're valuable, but still keeps an eye on them. They should be the ones leading the Bounty Boards instead of the Order of Shadows.
---
Instead we just got GW1 references (firebrand? uh, the tomes tell desert stories!) and cheap excuses (holosmith? uh, power of the sun!).
