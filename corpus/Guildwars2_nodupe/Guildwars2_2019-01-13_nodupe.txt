I’ve only ever seen it used by incels, MGTOWs, nice guys, and other internet dregs. They use that term as much as Chad, Stacy, foid, etc. Even if they didn’t invent it, they’ve appropriated it.

---
Wow, you're a map maniac! Thank you so much for contributing to the wiki on top of all the other things you contribute to the community! 
---

---
Chances are the overwrite by Alex on the Auditorium map was accidental, or they have an idea for where it could go instead. Maybe message them and see what their thoughts were at the time. 
---
&gt;!It's the absorbed magic of the current dead elder dragons plus balth. Mordremoth to the left, zhaitan on the righ.!&lt;
---
Also it ends exactly where it means to, it's not even a cliffhanger. We know exactly the status of all current characters and what we do next is what the next episodes will deal with. 
---
Anyone who "expects" something from anet is a fool.
---
I am certain about what we can expect from gw2 community - "look what i drew posts on reddit" with 1k upvotes each other day.
---
Is it? I've only played the main character story that you level up with and that was pretty boring. Are other story lines on the game better?
---
-Returning player in same boat as op

Aww not talking about the server, I was ready to summon /u/lovaa
---
The animation for meteor shower on Asura is way cooler than humans/sylvari. At least for the males, idk about the females. *dances around then waves hand*

AMEN GANDARA PRIDE

Zooms in on tiny black dot.
---
Oh i get it!!
---
It's a skale! For scale!
---
Apparently this is bugged. I have completed 3 deeds and only two of them were checked off the list. Consequently, I cannot commune with the font. Reported it all over the place and there was a patch indicating mismatched deeds were corrected but I think they forgot about those of us who had it done before the patch. So now that one looks like it is in limbo.
---
Thank you for stating this. I knew there had to be some replacement for the $15 a month subscription, but didn't know how much some customization options are.
---
I agree, the original story kinda sucks... but both HOT and POF have given a much improved story experience
---
Even with nerfed condition duration you can still play the old chaos build and do decent. It's far from optimal and players on the same level of play as you will probably outdps you by several thousand dps on stuff like Largos where confusion spikes extremely hard. Still better than not running mirage on those bosses most of the time. You will need to switch runes tho, renegade runes will not get you anywhere anymore.
---
Something like this:

---
Why Self Deception over Riddle of Sand? Simply because riddle of Sands only resets on shatters =&gt; You loose your illusions. Self Deception on the other hand lets you instantly build up 3 illusions again if you ever have to shatter or loose clones due to phasing (Largos etc.). In my opinion instant clones &gt;&gt; ~16 confusion ticks
---
My life is different  now.
---
Who won? My power blew out just as you were thinking who to choose.
---
They start you on a frikken dinosaur, and they get MORE fun as they go. Anet's creed of making everything fun truly shines with their mount design.
---
cool! shortest possible human with large body type i assume? i wanna make one now for myself
---
Ex-WoW player here. Uninstalled WoW finally with the latest expansion.
---
GW2 doesn't really compare to WoW. It's kind of its own thing. I'd certainly encourage you to pick it up and try it out, especially WvW. 
---
However, if you want a WoW-style MMO, but something that's metal, I happily recommend FFXIV. 
---
It starts off slow, but it's a wonderful single-player RPG with MMO elements (this will make sense after you play it for a bit), that also has the usual gearing up/dungeons/raiding.
---
And it also has endgame fashion. 
---
And boss music. So much boss music. So many boss themes. 
---
What armor is this?  I need this!  Also what body type is your Norn?
---
It depends, I personally like the story a lot, so I would buy living world season 2 first, because HoT happens after season 2. But idk if you will play a lot this game or not, if you are not sure or don't care about the story, get as much lvl 80 exotic gear from the trading post as you can afford (until you fully gear up) and go straight for HoT, get your elite spec completed and then play PoF so you get your second elite spec. If you do care about the story though, also buy season 3 before PoF.
---
Just for clarity, are you requesting a legendary Focus with a Guardian tome appearance? 
---
Haha, far off. Largest norn possible with large body type.
---
Yes! Sorry if I did not articulate that clearly 
---
I don't intend to buy the living world expansion though, just the standard HoT and PoF, will it impact the gameplay in a negative way if I dont have it?
---
Ok here it is:
---
X skill 1
---
Y skill 2
---
A skill 3
---
B skill 4
---
Start button skill 5
---
Back button (button next to start button) interact
---
Left Pad f1 (profession skill 1)
---
Up Pad f2 (profession skill 2)
---
Right Pad f3 (profession skill 3)
---
LB button dodge
---
RB button jump
---
Left Joystick move (forward back side)
---
Right Joystick mouse control
---
Left Joystick press 180 turn
---
Right Joystick press weapon swap
---
Right Trigger Select (or left mouse button)
---
Left Trigger right mouse button
---
Now the combo keys. This is necessary because there isn't enough button for all the skills and actions.
---
Down Pad + X healing skill
---
Down Pad + Y utility skill 1
---
Down Pad + A utility skill 2
---
Down Pad + B utility skill 3
---
Down Pad + Start elite skill
---
Down Pad + LB f4 (profession skill 4)
---
Down Pad + RB f5 (profession skill 5)
---
Other combo keys
---
Left Trigger + Right Joystick move camera around
---
Right Trigger+ Right Joystick also moves camera around but behaves different when you are moving (this will be your back camera)
---
Hope this helps. For me this is the layout I feel more comfortable with; it feels very natural. It may feel different to you and it may take you sometime to find what works for you.
---
Like I said I've been using it for over 2 years and I love it.
---
Good luck and sorry it took me so long to post.
---
I think there is a problem with emails containing "+" as well. One of my emails contain "." and "+" and I couldnt never launch it from LB in any version, I always got white screen so I had to write it manually in the gw2 launcher.
---
I also sent u a PM cuz I'm not sure if the problem is related to the special caracters from password.. 
---
Eargle Hounskull, Houndskin Mantle, Heavy Plate Chestguard, Forgeman Gauntlets, Stag Chausses, Eagle Greaves, Rockcrusher, Gate of Good-Byes. Largest height, fattest body type.
---
I  completely 100% agree with you! I made the same experience :c
---
You don't get the chests without the buff so there's no sense in continuing.
---
OH NO HE'S HOT!
---
Oh your personal average may very well be 3. Coincidentally the average of a person not playing the game will be 0 while a very lucky person might have had an average of 10 however unlikely this will be. What's interesting in the long run is the expected average value. You get this by multiplying likely hood of each drop with their yield and summing all up. The result is 1.0*3+6*x+2*y... Where x and y are values between 0 and 1 and represent the likelyhood of a drop by one of the sources (the hidden chests in the three rooms for x, the metas for y etc.). It's easy to see that the result must be greater than 3.
---
But since your average was 3: did you open all hidden chests + the one in the southwing every day? 
---
 Don’t be at all, my original main was a thief too! For the two elite specs you have daredevil and deadeye. Daredevil gives you an extra dodge and lets you wield a staff. It also changes your dodge to make you go faster, deal damage, or deal condi damage. Deadeye let’s you world a rifle and gives you extra access to stealth. It’s kind ike a sniper class. Personally I prefer playing world pve with the daredevil spec (hot) so I’d level that up first if I were you. Hero points are not expansion bound, so you can spend the hero points you earn in pof on hot elite specs if you want.
---
I also believe you get two 80 boosts when you get both expansions. I’d continue to level up your thief and use the boosts on other classes.
---
Which is pretty normal to feel from time to time. If you don't, ever, there is something wrong with you actually.
---
What's that side room with lava in the underground area of the final mission? Do we get to see that? I admit I didn't look closely cause I was going for the speed achievement.
---
Nope you are not. I don't mind random join requests but if you decline or get declined i think everyone should just take it and move on. The problem is that people feel entitled to it and that can get on your nerves sometimes.
---
Hell, I just might pass the baton. :D Or we can cooperate ;)
---
Good to see someone else doing something like this as well.  
---
I started writing TacO because the only thing that was similar was an Overwolf app from the ArenaNet official overwolf app competition, and overwolf is... Let's just say I don't think highly of that piece of software.
---
C# and XNA should be pretty close to TacO's performance, and will make development quite fast.
---
It's such a good animation! I never noticed the difference, but that's so cool!
---
There's getting annoyed which is a normal reaction, and then there's getting so frustrated you feel like you need to vent on reddit :'D
---
So them not dropping a very specific feature that has never before been talked about in a very specific release negates their statement...how exactly? 
---
Would an Xpac that didnt include a dwarven Guild hall also not be a real expansion?
---
Anything time gated. I wish I had took the time early on in the game making charged quartz crystals. Would have saved me a little bit of time later on.
---
I wish i had your luck
---
If that wild party animal, or his descendant, appears in Tyria in GW2 times to spread musical cheer via a new Club Elona, my sylvari's so in! :)
---
well what expansion level content did we get this release? rollerbeetle sure, personal instance and armor set sure, but now? nothing
---
You don't - unless they changed this with the POI update. But without the buff you cant get the hidden chest and thus the 3 guaranteed jewls.
---
Where are those notes coming from?
---
Making throwaway skins and achievements for people who want to waste their time grinding open world nonsense is fine. Locking Diviner's, an actual relevant stat combination that is going to be *considered a prerequisite for other content*, is not. The problem here is that people who want to be a part of interesting instanced content but haven't been actively raiding for the past 6+ months now have this garbage timegated grind thrown in front of them as a roadblock. There are people in my guild trying to learn Chrono who are massively demotivated right now because they don't have the resources to instantly stat-select into Diviner's, have no desire to grind out the trash content, and don't enjoy running suboptimal gear.
---
The problem *is* that this content is fundamentally bad content. Assuming you don't take the TP route, you have to do two AFK metas separated by an hour with absolutely nothing worthwhile to do on the map during that time. You show up at a specific time, kill trash mobs for a few minutes, afk for about 45 minutes, then kill more trash mobs for a few minutes, and then you get to "solve" the same couple of puzzles again for the nth time in order to get enough jewels for *one* piece of gear. With the TP route (which is hard to judge right now because the price of the light is probably going to go up once everyone ditches this boring map), you get to skip to the part where you "solve" puzzles on repeat every day. Literally just going through the motions because there's no actual challenge and you've seen it all before.
---
I've done the exact run you're talking about three times and gotten 1 extra orb across all attempts. 6/day is lucky, and I won't be going out of my way to do the extras moving forward since they never drop.
---
Yes! As a friend and I was playing it, I immediately felt that way on the outside part of the map. I think it’s because it’s not wide open anywhere. The paths are windy and narrow...it totally reminded me of GW1 maps.
---
These are amazing =)
---
If you are looking for wow style progression GW2 will not offer it.  I play both and what I like  about GW2 is the open world content.  The story quests are typically much better than wow as well.  
---
Overall you will likely get your money’s worth to grab path of fire.  If you want a bit more challenging world content the hot expansion is solid as well.   You might want to just login, see what is going on in the base game and if the classes feel fun for you.
---
Min/Max for stats is attainable by anyone.  What distinguishes you as an above average player is how well you know your class/abilities, the encounter, your execution, and general game knowledge/understanding of other classes. 
---
It's okay to share one's feelings about experiences in the game here.
---
Two! Personal space!
---
Oh alright. So other that the two chest, what's the point?
---
Uhm how about a decent Elder dragon fight? 
---
Also: We're getting expansions size Maps with every release now. Remember how these used to be? Bloodstone Fen? 
---
And even if they hadnt released a single expansion-level content this release this would not demonstrate that they cant release expansion level content in Episodes, only that they didnt this time. I am too waiting for expansion level features with ls releases, but your cynicism here is uncalled for.
---
The word "thot" has pretty much become a meme. It's like saying "Dab on em" or something "trendy". Dreamthot is my main's IGN, and I just come up with stupid names because I want to personify my shit-postiness. Or whatever. 
---
And I have literally never heard Chad or Stacy used in my own life so. 
---
Yeah there are things in game called activities and they ard competitive, like the keg thing. No idea what they meant...
---
Dude this might be it! And if that's really a reference to it, then that would be amazing!
---
&gt;  your opinion. I think it's really nice.
---
Did you totally miss this part of my post, or did you acknowledge it and willingfully disregard it?
---
Again, I'm fine with you thinking its underwhelming. BUT THAT IS WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT IT. For what it's worth people fucking hated flames of war, I loved it. People will have different tastes and I'm for sure happy that not everything that is "legendary" is a big ball of lightning. Hell I have 2 legendary armors that I reskinned because it's too much for me. These are opinions we are talking about and with that said if you dont like it = dont craft it. It's really as simple as that.
---
Considering you can't take portal while holding the treasure.. they should fix this to drop the treasure when you port back in using f5
---
Of getting in there? The throne achievement, the unhidden chests and before the update the POI I guess? The person might also not have know whats in there and just wanted to explore, hell if I know with people acting like that.
---
You've hit the nail on the head!
---
Yeah this rando guy needs to learn some manners.   Looking to complete the map on alts has lead me to search for parties with others to use a teleport to friend, but I have not sent a blind invite and never cussed at anyone who ignores my request in say chat, otherwise if would be cussing 95% of those in the catacombs.  And I tip a gold or 2 for people who help.  
---
The way that ANET has set up those two POIs is frustrating to me since it limits your ability to map complete to one toon/day **unless** you resort to soliciting ports.   
---
And thanks to that random, mysterious Mesmer who ported by Engineer today, whoever you are.  
---
Yup my potato cant handle the stress at the lowest settings :(
---
You shouldn't be worried at all. People don't run the meta just because of the legendaries. And excluding amalgameted gemstone, all gen 2 legendaries except the first four can already be crafted just from playing PoF.
---
It's been more than 5 years and people still do vanilla world bosses.
---
As far as lore goes, the Firebrand extends to being "lorekeepers" being tasked to "to record the achievements and culture of the people of Elona". The tomes themselves ares shown as books not only with the Firebrands but even with the original guardian's elite skill. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I agree regarding getting another focus. I can't imagine anything coming any time soon, but there is always hope!
---
Actually, the Norn are fairly accurate in size. They are described as nine feet tall in EOTN and GW2. It's just that because we see more norn, charr, and other larger races (as well as camera angle/zoom) It can see as if they aren't as big as they should be. I once compared and yeah, human npcs tend to be about waist/hip-high to Norn, which is accurate.
---
It may seem that they are smaller, but the Norn are not actually smaller then they should be, compared to humans or other races. A max height female norn is about the same height as a Kodan, who are described as "Ten feet tall"
---
Thanks a lot for all the details man! I've only played PvE until now, I think ive completed the first 3 dungeons so yea I still have a lot to explore xd
---
By the way, isn't there a high armor class that is unlocked when you buy an expansion? HoT I think
---
Na. You're not an ass. They didn't ask at the start why they needed the accept. Not everyone going to assume or want to jump on the ball to help. 
---
ITs also YOUR game time/freedom. You do what you want. Just block and move on. Or don't reply. I dislike people who just ask for accept too. I've had that go down a few times. So if that the case I'm an asshole too. :o
---
If it’s any consolation a key gripe in WoW (prolly the premier loot game) right now is that there is so much loot flowing everywhere it trivializes everyone’s efforts. 
---
Yeah! I made an ice themed norn guardian to use with it and I’m sure it’s gonna look great. The whole blue theme will go well with nevermore too. 
---
Do you have nevermore? 
---
I wasn't THAT frustrated over it but it's nice to vent and move on. Thanks folks!
---
Damn, wish I saw this earlier. I have a setup that I am extremely proud of. Cool contest though!
---
Look at the sinews on those legs! MMMmph!
---
it does if your team pushes you to your death xD
---
Griffon may win in overall utility and usefulness, but the beetle is the most fun to drive!
---
In actuality, the fight outside occurs a grand total of once. The fight happens at the exact same time as the Commander goes within the lair, and the commander doesn't take part with the lane fighting in canon.
---
A while back, during season 1, Anet came out and said that events happen one time, not repeatedly. That's why we fought the Marionette of Scarlet in the shiverpeaks for two weeks was purely gameplay, the fight occured once and was victory.
---
Jahai supports this as well, by noting the shatterer is death-branded after being revived from it's death at the hands of the vigil in Ascalon. 
---
Three! Stay out of my personal space!
---
&gt;Makes sure you reset your saved preferences
---
  
---
Good grief.  Was wondering why (i thought) they never added one for Jahai
---
You can still min/max and it’s much better as your efforts will not be trivialized with a new set of gear in a month.  GW2 does offer a ton of stat differences on gear and different builds/runes.  It just keeps the options on a somewhat level playing field and you can be viable on pretty much day one.
---
It’s a fine CPU. For GW2, higher IPC and clock speed is preferred over extra cores due to the fact that it was built on a super old engine that doesn’t do multithreading very well.
---
Because of this, Intel CPUs are usually better for games that use less than 4 threads, sometimes even then.
---
The 8400 though is a bit worse than AMD Ryzen 5 2600 (X) and is cheaper.
---
Yea was my last legend I made for my rev now im mostly using it on my daredevil :p
---
The expansions and living story are much much better than the initial one.
---
Wow nice. How is it on daredevil? Can I see a picture?
---
Shove off Steamy Romance Novels, we have a new best-selling author on the market!
---
(For reference, the novels are from WoW. About as monstrous tbh)
---
If you are in na i can show u on game, im playing rn
---
This worked for me. Not sure if it's coincidence either, but at least it gave me something else to do. 
---
And this is true, yes, but there's no precedent for making legendaries specifically for either Core Professions or Elite Specializations.
---
Given Mantra and replacement of Virtues with Tomes, each skill discussing a specific aspect of Elonian lore, I think that covers the Firebrands librarian slant. I'm not saying it's a bad idea, I'm saying what we have covers what you're asking for. 
---
Yeah I’m on NA as well. Will go on in a second. What’s your ID? I don’t remember the last four numbers on mine. 
---
Unlocking the masteries in hot will be much more satisfying without the mounts as well.  They kinda trivialize the content.
---
And my comment was one of mine. OP's post is valid, I just don't think it was necessary.
---
Casiopex.8360
---
Oh my, I'm in love with its design and the way you colored it. Great artwork!
---
I do these on the first Saturday of each month, so the next one is Feb 2 :) In game, I'm Emikadon.8542, feel free to whisper whenever you need help!
---
The Heroic Font is North of the Stonefall PoI(Thunderhead Keep). You'll need a Vision Crystal.
---
Or it's the All Seeing Eye - it's the Illuminati man!
---
I've been using Doylak Boots, Chest, Gloves and Shoulders, with Stag pants. Love the look that gives it.
---
I'm honestly surprised and appreciative that the couple of times I've blind-invited someone for help, they were willing to accept no problem. If I were to do it properly, I know I should at least whisper them first asking if they'd let me party up with them briefly for assistance.  
---
You're not an ass for refusing. Just state that you prefer at least a "Hi, can I join you" or the like before you accept anything and move on. You can get some pretty awkward situations out of just accepting random invites, and I don't blame anyone who's reluctant to do so.
---
It's the Eye of Janthir!
---
Thanks so much for the help!  Wiki doesn't have answers yet and map chat is quiet.
---
Yes the revenant. It’s alright I like other classes better personally. It’s a good class for wvw though as ranged dps.
---
would be awesome if you could actually create a character with that height
---
Just block the rage kiddies and move on. 
---
I always hated that legendary horse shortbow but, recently crafted it anyway. While running around some map, someone stopped near me and said, “gay boi bow”. I have no idea what that actually means, assumed he was disparaging my weirdo horse bow, and said, “so’s your face!”.
---
Point being, if you have to respond, just say, “so’s your face”
---
I wish I could find even one rune. 
---
Nah I think it's just some rando asshat.
---
Venting with a community you feel part of...is different than normal reaction? I'm sorry i don't follow.
---
 I'm just gonna repeat and say this is a perfectly normal reaction from time to time. It'd only be weird if they reacted this way every time, which would be an assumption easily proven false by looking at their submit history.
---
You may disagree with me obviously.
---
Nope. I ignore blind invites too. You owe them nothing if they can't take even a tiny amount of time to act like an actual human being. I bet their mother's raised them better than that and I often tell them so. 
---
Yes, but that's not comparable to most MMOs. Most of them aren't as reactive as GW2, and that's why min-maxing usually means stuff/runes/charms.
---
I did kind of the same thing, I played since launch until HoT, I had 1000+ hours on warrior but told myself I would play only weaver when coming back, and now I enjoy it a lot.
---
Just find a class you want to play and create a new character or use an old one. I'm just using other chars to craft. I can also play warrior for fun when I want. And I'll probably switch to another class when I'm tired of playing weaver.
---
AP, wardrobe, gold, dyes and everything isn't something you want to farm again
---
Awesome work, I love seeing good players experimenting and coming out with their own signature builds.
---
Love this kind of stuff, ever since Gryphon it's been a lot easier :)
---
It wasn't criticism, it was trolling, you just weren't aware of the story.
---
Doing daily fractals. They drop from the reward chests fairly regularly.
---
Noob here, what do you do with farmed geodes?
---
I was wondering why this subreddit is filled to the brim with posts about people circle jerking each other and nothing else. 
---
Now we know.
---
I think it's really cute
---
Have to do both meta parts
---
You need 3 Exquisite Serpentine Jewels per Dragonsblood weapon, to craft it. It is apart of the Diviner's Orichalcum- Imbued Inscription recipe. Then if you choose to make the Heroic version of the Dragonsblood, you need 3 more per weapon as that same recipe from above is also apart of crafting it. :)
---
First of all, the game has two expansions that are buy to play with no subscription model, with a free to play trial version that lets you go through the entire core game and through max level.
---
Also, you're going to get a pretty biased answer asking if the game is worth it to play, since this is a sub entirely dedicated to the game itself.
---
Why don't you just try it out? Again, the core game is free, and that pretty much covers the entire game that came out at launch plus a little bit more.
---
Thank you for your response, really when I say weaver I mean the whole elementalist branch as well as the whole mesmer branch.
---
Elementalist has viable classes of healing and damage. Mesmer of tank and damage and Hunter of damage and healing.
---
I like that they are classes that are needed and can fulfill various roles.
---
When you began playing, you experienced Core Tyria and the dungeons. Core tyria was the setting for living world season 1 and got changed quite a bit, with lion's arch being deleted entirely and replaced with New lion's arch, and some places such as Southsun Cove and the Toxic Tower coming into place. Since then, Core Tyria has had very few updates, aside from the most recent roller beetle racetracks (they added I think 5 of them onto old maps), and the dungeons haven't been touched at all aside from some rewards being rebalanced alongside the rune and sigil update, making one of the dungeons very useful (Twilight Arbor). 
---
Development seems more focused towards making new maps, new fractals, new raids, rather than going back to the old ones. 
---
I think that's what they were going for, and they did it well. :'(
---
Living story, raids and fractals get the most regular updates in terms of content additions. Pvp/wvw, while getting updates as well, have to wait longer for additions most of the time (example: for wvw, an overhaul of the world linking system, including the release of an alloance system is announced, but still in devwlopment).
---
Balance updates for the classes happen several times a year, but i don't know the exact timing; the last one was ~nov-dec.
---
Hey, thanks for the fast answer, so with these 2 expansions I'll have more stuff/skills etc or just new regions and monsters/raids to kill/do ?
---
What exactly are you looking for in an MMO, if you don't mind me asking? And what were your problems with GW2 when it first launched? 
---
Because if you are looking for a game that's like an improved upon WoW, this still will not be quite the right game for you. 
---
Free base game. Try till 80 or beyond and judge for yourself!
---
I'm former mythic raider in WoW. GW2 raids are not that hard, but still very engaging and fun.
---
It might become boring someday, but you can add some fun by trying to become a good raider. Minmaxing your performance, analysing raid setup, trying different roles etc.
---
Hopefully the reinstall works but have you checked your drivers?  Make sure everything is up to date, and maybe try bumping your graphics down as low as you can stand for the instance.  Past that I'm not sure what else to try if the reinstall doesn't fix it.  Also, are you running any third party software at the same time?  ArcDPS or even programs meant to assist or control peripherals (I cant use Razer synapse right now, for example) can cause issues in some instances.  Doubt that's your issue but at least it's something to try.  Best of luck!
---
Good post, good post. 
---
Returning player (2 years off) have HoT expansion. Want to know what the state of WvW is on JQ. Also is DH a decent Roamer for WvW or should i go a different class. I have every class up to 80 minus the warrior. Thanks
---
Transferring gold and materials between the accounts will be easy since I can just mail them or in the case that I need to transfer many items quickly I can just log into both accounts. I kind of like being able to earn many of my achievements again so farming the ap doesn’t bother me so much. There are some account bound items on my other account I wish I could transfer as well but I’m content with my decision. I think for me the benefits of a fresh start on a new account is worthwhile. 
---
 They would just need to turn off the "show all" ability of the object when it's used in this fashion. Not a big deal but probably low priority for the devs.
---
And the first xpac adds gliders while the newest xpac adds mounts. Both are totally worth the price, especially seeing as their is no sub model. If you enjoy the free version, definitely grab the expansions. 
---
The Auditorium doesn't exist outside of the two instances that involve it does it?
---
1. 25% (without Mimic on Improved Alacrity) is the minimum amount of boonduration you'd need in a vacuum. Every application must hit your target and you can't delay the rotation at all.
---
2. 65.8% with Mimic on Improved Alacrity is roughly 35% more boon uptimes than you need. So basically yes, what you said.
---
3. Yes
---
4. The 65,8% isn't a value that I specifically calculated. It's just what you get from adding full Diviner's armor and food to the Berserker setup and reaches a very comfortable amount of boonduration.
---
It's the original model for Zhaitan that they created for the GW2 trailer, and was to be featured in Arah explorable before ArenaNet went with the newer look (and shrunk it for battle feasibility).
---
[It's this thing](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Zhaitan%27s_Rest_beta.jpg) without the texture.
---
He always has been, Primordus was the smallest of the Elder Dragons supposedly.
---
Mordremoth's core body was the Mouth of Mordremoth. That's why when Kralkatorrik fires his super blast, it shows [a picture of the Mouth of Mordremoth](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Mordremoth_channel.png) alongside a picture of Balthazar and Zhaitan. The whole "Mordremoth is the jungle" is a misnomer to represent the fact that his mind existed in much (but not all) of his corruption, such as the writhing vines beneath Verdant Brink. But that isn't his actual body.
---
[This image](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Elder_Dragons_size_comparison.png) shows the sizes of the Elder Dragons we've seen. It shows Zhaitan's original (dead) model, his final version, Mordremoth, Primordus' head, and Kralk's head from PoF and Storm Tracking (with a model of Vlast for scale).
---
And the deep sea dragon' won't be "all the oceans" because no Elder Dragon is the landscape. They all have a singular body. Some, like Kralkatorrik, can *momentarily* change their body into something else (e.g., Kralkatorrik into a sandstorm). But Mordremoth's "being the jungle" misnomer is a uniqueness to himself due to his connection to the Dream and his domain of Mind magic. Even after taking over the domain of Mind, Kralkatorrik isn't putting his consciousness into his minions or crystals.
---
I haven’t checked much since updated instabs but if no pain no gain is on and your power dps boon strip is essential otherwise you doing 1/3 dmg. (Unless they changed how no pain no gain works) 
---
Thank goodness your kind isn't so common. The whole stigma against what is allowed on a sub when it's relevant is in my opinion stupid. Your tribal opinions are your problem.
---
&gt; I bought and played GW2 when it first released but there was a ton wrong that I gave up.
---
What was wrong? Might be able to say if anything has been fixed.
---
&gt; How has the game improved? 
---
I mean how has WoW changed since MoP? Theres 6 years worth of stuff that has changed and been updated.
---
&gt; is the crowd still pretty large?
---
Yes
---
Scroll past
---
Both Storm and Sun are on the same area. Storm is all the way west of the area and sun a bit more east of Storm. 2 Elite Fire Elementalists ;) 
---
New content really brings out the entitlement.  Odds are good they wanted to use you as a port target to one of the two POIs in the catacombs - anet has fixed the Horde one, but the other presently requires a social solution if you're map completing with alts and don't want to do story with them.
---
Whatever their intent, they're the ass - blind invites are gauche and insulting someone for not accepting one is about as entitled as it gets in this game.
---
Ah, that makes sense. Bit of a shame, that would've been cooler than what we got.
---
ill upload it on youtube but the sylvari named heulwin did
---
Was he, in GW1? I thought you could only see a bit of his back, and it was about the size of a small hill.
---
I saw someone waiting outside the green plate room so I waved at him and he waved back and I left him in. He was pretty happy and mailed me some money. 
---
I've made an elementalist with the goal of never dying. I've had to delete and remake it twice now. I think both times when I was fighting and my internet cut out. Even took it to WvW once!
---
Oh, you are the same guy that wanted to upgrade his rig with the 2080ti, man if i had your options... Anyways:
---
GW2 is a terribly optimized Game when it comes to new Hardware, I am no computer expert myself but i am pretty sure that you will not have any success by upgrading to a high emd CPU like that aswell. Honestly, your best bet is probably even some older parts if you are really desperate about making the game run better. But even if you get the optimal components for the sole purpose of running GW2 as optimal as possible, you should keep in mind that world bosses with 30 to 50 players spaming heavily animated Abilities in combination with the World, Map and Boss Animations are simply hard to handle for nearly any PC. If these FPS drops really are a Problem to you, you might aswell just try lowering and adjusting some settings. This way you can make the Game perform much better and if you do it right, you will barely notice any differences.
---
I know this probably doesn't help you, but i tried my best :) have a nice day. 
---
Joko cutscene at the end of long live the litch 
---
I went from an i7 2600 and 1070  to an i7 8700k and RTX 2070
---
and have noticed no real difference.
---
So I  lost faith in wow as well and jumpped over to guild wars  been playing for about a month now almost at level 80 on my first play through . I've enjoyed it a lot they full voice acted story is really nice and the community is really nice. I have a guild already although haven't been able to interact a ton with them due to me being over seas but they still try to help when they can. Ive been downed doing some really stupid things and no  one gets up set they are kind enough to let the noob and  have a good laugh. I'd do it again in a heartbeat. Hope it helps 
---
Reaching
---
...How-
---
Not very, simply because it takes such little effort to do so. The main benefits of crafting is to craft ascended gear, food and utility items, and to assist in creating legendary gear. But it doesn't do much for money making. 
---
I use the Chat Pad for other interaction keys... 0 is my special action key, 9 is my mount, p is my switch target, , is my run key. I use those because they are close to the top and they are easy to press. But with the chat pad I have a full mini key board so I have access to everything else. L for map I for inventory, O for black lion store, etc...
---
I run an older amd fx 8 core and  a gtx 1080, my friend played on an overclocked 8700k and 1080ti, he got 6 more fps at the same settings in the same area at the same time. Only make the jump if the 9900k will help you in areas outside GW because in game it isnt worth it. Also, 3rd gen amd ryzen has shown early benchmarks being faster than the 9900k. Id sit and wait a bit and see what comes down the pipes in the next 6 months or so. 
---
Just to let you know in addition to the other comments. The current Free to play core game is basically the same as what used to be the only thing in the game. And that cost like $60 or so. So its really high quality for a free to play region.
---
I ran into quite a few players like the OP's party inviter in WoW back in my days of playing that. Usually younger kids or early teens. Always had questions and your answers never cleared anything up for them.
---
Thankyou!!!
---
Thank you so much!
---
Damn, NA only to prevent my Branded Sylvari to win I'm sure, you scoundrel. 
---
It is becoming increasingly evident that GW2 needs an engine overhaul, with each update they continually push the limitations of their antiquated engine and it is showing, maps and events frequently drive my fps down to the 10's, when plenty of up to date game engines happily crank out &gt;60 fps in ultra.
---
Do admit to trying to push people off cliffside today to see if that worked... sadly, they caught on :(
---
But if it's not an emergency, you should whisper first. To be honest, I can't think of why you would need to invite first in this game - there isn't tagging and such like in some other games.
---
Awesome post!
---
I am trying it now, grabbed a Necro, trying to learn the game and feel it out.  So far, not super thrilled over graphics but we will give it some time. 
---
Looks pretty good.
---
I'm not sure how i feel about the seer shoulder skin. If you like it then keep it.
---
Colors synergize very well but the head armor looks a bit out of place dye-wise.
---
The shoes look a bit bland so you can think about working on those too. I don't mind them though, not every piece of your outfit needs to stand out.
---
My only real complaint is the staff skin. It looks heavily out of place. Scythes should work very well. Try skull weapon skins (deathwish for staff i think?) and dark themed skins too.
---
"accept"
---
The moment you see someone *trying* to force you to do something, especially from a stranger, is a red flag. "accept", seriously? Lol. 
---
Then proceeded to curse at you. Wow. I would just block and move on...
---
Oh hey. These are my two main classes.
---
Dragon Hunter will overall be a more useful first level 80 class. And it's a shitton of fun.
---
DH has the advantage of being a Power DPS class, whereas most people running Berserker are Condition Damage DPS (aka condi). 
---
Now, there's nothing wrong with condi DPS. In fact it's desirable in a lot of end game content, even over power DPS sometimes. But, overall, Power DPS is more versatile. It's more useful in open world content because condition damage has a ramp up time, whereas power damage does all its damage upfront. Open world mobs have such low health that condi damage never has the time to ramp up and power damage wins out pretty easily. So for all open world content, HoT metas, etc. Power DPS is more useful.
---
In addition, it's **way** cheaper to gear. Getting a full exotic set of Berserkers stats (weapons, armor, and trinkets) will run you about 20-25g. I don't know how much Viper's will run you because it's enough that it's not typically worth crafting a Viper's exotic set, you're better off just waiting for ascended. My guess would be 2-3x as expensive though.
---
Now, don't get me wrong. I run my Berserker in open world content without a problem. And my friend's first character was a condition damage soulbeast and it served her just fine. It's what she used for open world, story, fractals, and raids, and she's one of the best players I know. 
---
But, if I were giving advice to a new player, I'd say make the power DPS class. It'll just be an easier time.
---
Plus, Dragon Hunter is a TON of fun. Their burst is outrageously high, the rotation isn't too bad, and there's a ton of little options and utility choices for you to make the class interesting and useful in a lot of situations. 
---
Berserker is a blast too though. As another poster said, going into Berserk mode and spamming those skills feels great.
---
Really, you can't go wrong here, but all the same my recommendation is 110% DH over Berserker.
---
Im stuck in this 3 days alrdy and contacted the support, still no respond.
---
Jessica Price shouldn’t have been fired. Her comments were quite rude, but devs in other games have had similar blunders without getting fired.
---
You have to realize when a game company hires someone and continues to employ them, they make a massive investment in them. That person then spends a considerable amount of time fitting into the team and learning.
---
ANet knew damn well she’d cause a lot of friction on her social media account (being vocally about social justice in a field that historically has backlashed to such)
---
It was simply the magnitude of the reaction. People instantly turned it into a culture war, that hit the front page of reddit. Of course she doubled-down. Devs in other games say rude shit all the time and there isn’t as much blowback.
---
The issue of her rudeness was hijacked by people who wanted her head on the chopping block.
---
And guess what? they got what they wanted.
---
Randoms on Reddit got a real person fired in a real company that spent real resources on them.
---
It’s a fucking horrible precedent, and it makes no sense in any other industry. Sure, Reddit got to have their “ooo look how poerful we are” moment, but overall it was a major blow to the industry as a whole.
---
If it had been a comment that didn’t invoke that culture war, the company would have stood behind the quality of her work, and then apologized or given her an opportunity to clarify or apologize or whatever. I know this because it happens every once in awhile in a lot of games.
---
“dev says X,” players are mad, company deals with it without just straight up sacking the person.
---
Instead, ANet just threw her publicly on the chopping block instantly, probably in a hastily done meeting.
---
It’s a bad precedent no matter what you feel about the culture war that was invoked. Not to mention randomly throwing Peter Fries under the bus too  
---
I also noticed my salvage rate is a lot slower than before! I keep getting salvage cancellations because of how long it takes. Used to be snappy several months ago. 
---
The TP is also a problem. Not to mention all of the sudden "Error occurred" notifications.
---
New season of Samurai Jack: Jack Goes to Tyria.
---
It depends on your goals, really. If you're into raiding, there's a decent chunk of grinding. If you want to do fractals, well that's a self-contained grind, but you can experience all of the story parts, and most mechanics at a lower intensity at lower tiers, which are easily completed without top-tier gear or meta strategies.
---
Other than that, the only real grindy thing is obtaining legendaries, and to an extent perhaps crafting. If you're in it for the story and the exploration, you can do nearly all of it solo.
---
I'd definitely say to give this game a go, but know that the game changes a lot between base-game and LW/expansion content. There's a noticeable difficulty bump, and combat requires you to engage a bit more.
---
Thanks for such a precise answer!!! Definitely I'll try DH out 
---
This is a really nice post! Thanks for taking the time to theory craft this up. Great research and reasoning in your conclusions.
---
Just experienced this bug today
---
alright. 
---
I mean, it takes no effort to accept and let them teleport or whatever with you. Should they have gotten aggro about it? No. But there are a lot of times in this game where you really have to go out of your way to not be helpful, and this is kind of one of them.
---
I’m a mesmer main and so I do my fair share of porting people places, but I also have had folks spend an hour or two of their time helping me without even me asking. That’s the beauty of it. If you want to ignore the rest of the players in an MMO, so be it. But you’re going against the current.
---
You also have to understand GW2 has a broad age and international demographic. You don’t know if a 13 year old Australian kid was waiting around for you so they wouldn’t interfere with you doing a puzzle to then have you just waste her time. Or if a Brazilian guy was in a party with his mom, trying to help her progress in the storyline.
---
Other players are people too trying to have fun, and they are not all going to be as well spoken as you.
---
is there actually any point in using inspiration anymore? just run renegade heal with dueling/ illusion chrono in diviner gear and fb runes
---
should easily keep up the quickness without gimping his dps to much
---
i got pof recently and i was suprised on how good the mounts are, i just got the raptor so far but im hyped af for the rest, i was expectin just an increase in speed, haha silly me
---
You're purposefully misinterpreting that statement to make an argument.  It's  an expansions worth of content over time.  Season 4 as a whole is an expansion in and of itself as with season 3.
---
I thought we bisected him.
---
The basic issue is it's not 20 copies of one item in a slot, but a single item with 20 charges.
---
The game can't handle the pain, er stacking of charged items.
---
On the other hand, GW2 lets you craft legendaries. I am no raider - barely even a grouper - so in WoW, my characters are not equipped particularly well. In GW2, by dint of a lot of questing and shopping lists, I actually have a Legendary Weapon, and I'm pretty proud of it. I don't get as much satisfaction from random loot rolls as I do from completing some pretty epic quests.
---
Aurene died after literally every future she saw ended in her dying, but we still tried to fight Kralkatorrik anyway because we conveniently forgot that Aurene looked at ALL THE FUTURES and she died in all of them and then got all shocked and sad when she died. We *literally* saw this coming. What's interesting is that Kralkatorrik only mentioned a single future to Glint. Perhaps fate in the world of Tyria is truly unavoidable, and we do find some way to defeat Kralkatorrik to fulfill this future. We just have to figure that part out. 
---
Last night I was trying to do the Mushroom Queen HP in Rata Novus solo. Ran it a couple times and never cleared, but on my last attempt, some necro came and tried to finish off that attempt. He almost instantly got deleted and I ported back to town so I could log out and sleep.
---
But right before I did, he requested to join my party (I was in one with a couple friends) and I told him I'm done and was logging out.
---
To my surprise, he started to vote kick everyone from my party (without being in it), me included. 
---
Tacking on to my previous post. Ascended is easiest to get via raiding. However, not having ascended doesn’t bar you from raids. Chrono, Banner Warrior, Support Scourge, and Power DPS classes can all be geared via the trading post or karma or dungeons SUPER easy and fast. (Of these, I’d use the dps/banner/chrono) You can enter raids with these and use them for nabbing up ascended drops or raid tokens fairly easily. Which then allow you to gear the 4Stat armors with ease (as most, it’s just better to go ascended imo). Of these, you’re looking at the commander, the minstrel, the viper, the now diviner. 
---
Notice btw, I mentioned chrono. Chrono can hit 90% BD for the cheap off of the trading post, around 60g last I checked. Tank or off chrono.
---
Crafting is available for those who don’t have the ability to get into the easy track, or don’t even enjoy the raid scene. But, at that point, you’re getting the stats because you want them, NOT because you need them. And, this timegate looks nothing like the Celestial timegate, which iirc was 5 days PER item. So, you’re looking at a month for JUST armor, no trinkets or weapons.
---
&gt;just run renegade heal
---
2nd healer is overkill on most bosses. The dps you'd gain from chrono going illu/dueling won't be more than the amount you'd lose from bringing a 2nd healer.
---
N E C C
---
Just grasping straws here, but is the server you want to join full? Either way you probably have but if not send a ticket and ask whats going on.
---
This has been something new lately. I have times now where it takes almost 30 seconds to actually load a sale and around a 10% chance that I just get 'error' when pretty much doing anything. Playing for over 3 years now and this has only been the last couple months.
---
YES!!!! An old guildie would spam them nonstop because he kept getting stacks of the single use!
---
hm yeah maybe im to used to pugs but from my experience most dps even the ones that actually manage a proper rotation, are utter shite and will die on single heal runs so yeah a 2nd healer will actually increase your dps contrary to popular belief xD 
---
Everything story wise is solo-able in this game. Dungeons can be soloed with max effort, but super end game content like Fractals and Raids (and bounties, certain meta events like the Octovine etc) simply can not be soloed. Luckily there's a LFG (Looking For Group) tab for each one of these types of content so you'll never be lacking a person
---
100% the reason I’m planning for the gamble ones and not the contract ones!!!
---
Yeah, I sent a ticket with a screenshot. I hope they fix it soon. 
---
I have a Ryzen 5 1600 and GTX 1060 and neither my GPU nor the CPU thread the game loves to use get close to 100% usage. They would need to update the engine to better utilize modern CPUs for anybody to see better performance.
---
happy cake day
---
I think it's because the 3rd deed gives the same item as the 2nd deed.
---
Can you post links to builds instead of links to youtube videos? :|
---
Gw2 is the worst optimised mmorpg out there, even a super computer probabaly won’t be able to run a stable 60
---
I’m just typing this to clarify a few things on GW2 raids, that are slightly incorrect.
---
Raids are only difficult to enter, if you use the LFG. There’s multiple training discords designed to get you LFG ready, as well as many groups later in the day that don’t care as much. That said, it’s pretty daunting still.
---
Class diversity, IS an issue! (Chronojail, HELLLLLLLOOOOO!!!) However, it’s not the game’s fault, it’s more the players. They’re the ones that denoted X class is needed, and Y boss is Z damage type boss. Totally is interchangeable! Matthias for example, a “condi” boss, it’s possible to clear without a single bit of (focused) condi damage from dps. It just favors condi due to mechanics of moving out and in, and the invuln bubble which could kill a power burst.
---
As for your “tfw kill boss/get upgrade” kinda agree. The upgrade thing, I’m glad we don’t have that... as well, if raids were annoying to enter, could you imagine trying to justify taking you when you DIDNT have the upgrade from the boss you’re trying to kill?? And the boss kill? -sigh- they’re just so incredibly easy.... just don’t stand in bad, stand in good, and pay attention, and anyone can do it. So I’m with ya there.
---
LD/LI/KP I’ve not seen a request for in a while... but could be zone/timing. Personally, I think they don’t prove a damn thing. People just being picky.
---
The builds are shown at the end of each video.
---
What was the result?
---
Wow so graceful! imagine seeing a lot of people doing this from the ground. What a scenery. This makes me appreacite the beauty of griffon more now :) 
---
That sucks to hear. A few EU players thought we were crazy on a previous thread, said nothing was off over there. 
---
The people downvoting you really have no clue how good the UI was.  Also, the GW1 UI has **build templates**, something that GW2 still doesn't have after 6 (**six**) years.
---
Cringe.
---
You’re very lucky. If you ever feel like sinking into a nihilistic &amp; narcissistic rabbit hole, go look up some incel subreddits. 
---
Yeah, the HoT story is really good too imo, and especially LS Season 3!
---
Huh, didn't think it was a common occurence. Happened to me too, though I thought it was because I finished the 2 focus kill deees at the same time.
---
And to make it even better, both expansions are for sale for 24,99 if i remember correctly. Will go on until 14 th so grab it when you can.
---
Everything you just provided doesn't mean anything for a simple question I asked for why a VO sucks. YOUR arguments are: 
---
1. They know better so  don't complain
---
2. it costs too much money for something to be good
---
3. too much time for developers to invest in something good
---
4. if you don't like a certain aspect of the game you're "entitled"
---
5. creative teams "aren't a thing" &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; wow
---
6. it's better to save money than  invest in something that's good
---
I think you might be a dev, boo boo... 
---
I'd rather not have to go to youtube, skip to the end, and squint at a video just to read a build.
---
Oh how magnificent world boss fights would become...
---
He healing reduction on the agony was such a pain in the dick for healers. So often I felt like my heals just weren’t doing anything because of SA.
---
They could have been crying because George H W Bush died. We could play this game all day, but it doesn't change the fact there was really only 2 reasons why someone could cry in that episode. 
---
I was on reddit because I wasnt at home, god forbid I use reddit and expect reasonable spoiler etiquette from the community. The story ending isnt the only thing the subreddit talks about - there was other content at play, too. I turned off map chat obviously.
---
Going out of your way to spoil things makes you a wanker fyi
---
You missed your opportunity, sadly. They added a sound option to disable 'other player's projectile sound effects', including the pony bows.
---
Well I'm that case Joko *was* trapped inside the mists
---
Not only do the mounts feel great and are unique from each other, but their different designs also encourage the player to view the world around them in a different light and use different methods of traveling that were normally unavailable to them.
---
Can't wait for you to get the rest of them ;)
---
It seems great. Will it include Pact Agents?
---
When are they going to fix keep glitching on desert borderland
---
Leveling might feel grindy to you due to the lack of direction? 
---
Some tips: 
---
Don't force yourself to do all the hearts.
---
The mapping components like vistas and pois give a non-negligible amount of exp, so finding those is a nice way to get some exp. 
---
The enemies with yellow names/health bars that aren't aggrod to you give more exp (and do more damage) than standard mobs.
---
Finally, dungeons give a good chunk of you can find a group. I think you unlock the first one at level 30?
---
I just finished it for the first time last night, and I have to be honest, I didn't like it very much. Not that the story itself was awful, just felt rushed. Characters either taken from nowhere or from the personal stories of other races (I play a norn) doing stuff, reasons for this or that character to die coming out with basically no setup. And the ending on the airship felt very weird, too. Suddenly, magical, amazing, elder dragon killing cannons! And also, I don't know if my game was bugged or something, but there were some weird music choice. Like serene strings and piano while I was defending the source from attacking risen. o_O
---
That said, the song you mention was genuinely great, and made me just stand around listening to it. So it ended on a high note in that sense. Even so, I wouldn't call it anywhere near the best MMO story I've experienced.
---
Still, I bought the season 2 bundle as well last night and did the first 2 episodes, and that was MILES above the personal story. And I keep being told that it just gets better from then on, so... hey, keep trucking.
---
i think most of the living world maps feel like this at least from this season.  Thunderhead plays similar to Sandswept to me with the rotating metas being decent but not spectacular and good landscape/decor.  It's also got a good metal farm.
---
The general events do a fair job of filling in the gaps between metas without being long time-sinks and most events have some sort of achievement associated with them so you are encouraged to do them all.  I'd say it's a net positive map that requires you to farm like hell to get all of the weapons but at least it isn't null-sigil part 2.
---
I think the map is beautiful and the two main metas are fucking awesome. But def when I was there didnt feel compelled to too many other events like jahai bluffs
---
Not from a chronomancer
---
No https://i.imgur.com/oTwrPeh.jpg
---
Thing is, Primordus is the ONLY dragon that does not outright corrupt living beings to make his minions. The Destroyers are solely constructed from Primordus's magic, hence why they stopped moving when he was weakened by the mcguffin in S3.
---
The amount of veteran adds on a boss fight is ridiculous. Needs to be scaled back a bit.
---
Already am, but don't need annoying shit like this that adds no difficulty and a ton of useless frustration.
---
&gt; but horribly grindy (you need 50 inscribed shards)
---
I don't think doing some meta and mining some nodes are " horribly grindy " even in the casual world of GW2.
---
I don't raid, but I've been playing since launch, I have characters of all professions, and I'd agree with all of this wholeheartedly. The strengths and weaknesses of each profession, have changed over time, and doubtless will again. And the different mechanics give them all their won "feel", some of which you'll likely love, and some of which you won't. So even though it sounds trite, the absence of the tank/healer/damage "holy trinity", and the fact that it's not exactly hard to get a character to L80, means that the best advice with GW2 is definitely to try them all out and go with one you enjoy.
---
Yeah ! I love the mounts so much ! They help me to explore more conveniently and their skins are really beautiful. 
---
It’s new; a-net is aware of it. It’s been driving me crazy, but I’ll manage. 
---
I’m sure we’ll be getting pitch notes saying that it’s been fixed within the next couple months. 
---
I think that’s a fair timeline due to the fact that it’s it’s probably fairly difficult to pinpoint exactly what’s causing it and then fix the issue. 
---
wtf. lol. i need some of those. i have to use gems to buy bl kits now cuz i have more exotics in the last couple of weeks. lol weird.
---
this would be a nice idea.
---
Yeah no, it adds a smaller extra layer of thought you have to go through when moving. In a game where your position is integral to the combat system, this is a nice addition. 
---
Instabs are supposed to be about changing how the fractal is experienced and boy does Slippery achieve that.
---
*goes to make a mirage*
---
Wait till you start playing expansions and living story its a whole new level:-P
---
Oh yea I forgot about the mounts design too ! I love the mounts game design, art and animation, etc and the beautiful skins ! Good job there! 
---
I want to start it again from the beginning, I’ve heard it’s a lot better put together now
---
The characters that you didn't recognize were probably the rest of the Destiny's Edge guild, whose stories are elaborated on in the dungeon story modes. If those dungeons are finished before the final Arah-dungeon, it makes a lot more sense as to why those characters are there and act the way they do.   
---
This is very easy to miss though, and I think Ionly got the idea from this reddit.
---
It just gets better and better my friend :)
---
By all indication Gaheron's spirit should still be in the Mists in whatever afterlife charr have after he was banished from Tyria. As shown with the human necromancer Priestess Rhie summoning the spirit of Alastia Crow in the [Speaker of the Dead](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Speaker_of_the_Dead) instance, charr necromancers might likewise be able to summon Gaheron's spirit for a short while although such a ritual would be dangerous to undertake as it draws nightmares, aatxes and other dangerous beings to attack the caster from the Mists. It would be interesting if we ran into his and other villains' spirits in the Mists to fulfill Alastia Crow's foreboding words, except the twist would be that we convince or coerce them to join us against a bigger threat: "I know of you, Hero. Many of your foes walk now in the Mists. They speak of you with hatred and fear. Beware, lest you join them."
---
What's interesting is that we don't know if Gaheron had a mate or an entire harem and if he has any legitimate or illegitimate cubs or how old these cubs might be by now (Gaheron was slain in 1325 AE, and it's currently 1332 AE). Although the Citadel of Flame's explorable mode shows various splinter groups vying for Gaheron's throne before we defeat them, there are still at least four Flame tribunes if not more out there (depending on if the Flame Legion follows the example of the Iron Legion having six tribunes, as we did kill Tribune Burntclaw in explorable mode and another Tribune in Fireheart Rise) who'd be next in line for the Flame throne.
---
I always entertained the idea that, following the events of Citadel of Flame's explorable mode, the Flame Legion's splinter groups would focus on specific attributes of the legion. So you'd get one faction relying on shamans and their fire magic, another focusing on stalkers and spies specializing in counterintelligence like [Frye Fireburn's](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Frye_Fireburn) famous Fireshadows of old, a third one focusing on brute force while having access to the infamous breeding farms for females which [Drakin Cinderspire has alluded to during his boss battle with Kalla's Killers](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Defeat_the_fire_shaman_and_his_minions#Dialogue), and a fourth faction being the founder of Season 1's Molten Alliance with the dredge.
---
Good luck with the roleplaying event! I've been hoping for Flame Legion to return to the story one day even if it's in its splintered state, so it's nice to see that interest in them has remained after all these years. :)
---
Just dont drop soap. 
---
I like the Firebrand version more.
---
It can be worth doing it on long-term. Doing fractals every day for a week gives you +/- 100g, so that would be +/- 400g a week, which turn out to be quite worth if you do it consistently.
---
even though i kinda agree with most of the stuff said and appreciate the work you did, i think 99% of the chronos in this game should rather still keep up 100% boon duration everywhere, since they even struggle to maintain perma boons there no matter which scenario.
---
on a sidenote since i read your comments about fracs and also a few other comments about inspiration:
---
my personal opinion is, that inspiration has still it's value in daily fractals since you can avoid a lot... especially if you time healing signet somewhat aswell.
---
in raids in my opinion it is a must have apart from some specific bosses
---
Thank you for your offer, but I already wrote my script hehe. It's really nothing fancy, just double click every 5s (gobbler cd) with a hotkey toggle.
---
Great you enjoyed it so much. The next story arcs are way better so have fun with them. 
---
Why is it called "LS S4E5"?
---
In my understanding it means "Living Season Season 4 Episode 5" but isn't that one Season to much? Wouldn't it make more sense to say "LS4 E5"? 
---
lol. it's been on for 3 days now. i feel like it's more of a bug than anything. but some druid skills throw me off hardcore if i make a quick turn. so. sigh. guess i'll live as 100cm with slippery slope keeps on going till the next patch.
---
It's condi and can deal a lot of damage but it needs some time to ramp up and dosmet provide much burst. From my understanding it's used in long fights in raids but not that much in fractals. But I am sure you can make It work. 
---
Nice!! I love it when people come up with stuff like this :D I personally have a toon set up as a teen norn. Tallest human body possible with cute chubby cheeks and that one hairstyle with the headband and twin braids that the norn got first. On top of that, some very carefully chosen clothes, at least five of which are things that say "Hey look what I killed!" ( Houndskin mantle, beastslayer weapons, you know.)  I make people guess what race she is. Proud to say I don't think anyone has ever guessed human. 
---
Pretty bad tbh
---
Just finished episode 3 of season 3 and yeah it's really good, and I finally unlocked that 5th fucking downed ability. 
---
Really? Didn't you thought the Zhaitan fight was pretty dumb?
---
I don't know how many MMO's you played but the core main story of GW 2 is not very good compared to other MMO stories out there.
---
The exact same thing happened to me. When Kralk headbutted the platform, I got pushed under the terrain and couldn't get out. Not even /stuck was working for me. I ended up having to quit and restart but thankfully there was a savepoint right after you use the crystal so it was nothing too brutal, but still frustrating to go through.
---
For whatever reason, this is the first map this season that I actually feel attached to. I think it's because I'm not into the desert vibe at all so just getting some snow feels very refreshing. 
---
Just let me tell you that although there's going to be a huge hiccup in the story because you can't play the experiment that was Living World season 1, it's worth getting over it because the story has gotten exponentially better over time.
---
Season 2 is better than the Personal Story, Heart of Thorns is even better, and it just keeps ratcheting up. It's really something, and if you enjoyed Zhaitan then you're really in for a treat with what's been happening lately.
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/49593/the-deathcap-minion-master-elite-spec
---
I'd like a minion master. Follow the link to see a possible design it could have. I'd also be happy with a ritualist/shaman elite spec for necromancer. As for a vampiric spec, I'm extremely skeptical on how fun or interesting it could be.
---
For Mesmer I'd like a Siren. A sound based mesmer that uses it to debuff foes and create areas of an almost hex like effect.
---
For engineer I'd like some sort of Golemmancer that uses their uniqueness to be sorta a super sentai warrior.
---
For Elementalist I would like to see a reduction of use of skills in favor of something more focused and streamlined. So only access to 2 attunments but gains weapon swaps. Maybe a true embodiment of their favored element at the time.
---
For Revenant I'd like a unique melee mid range weapon like greatsword that shoots blade beams by slashing with a norn elite spec that embodies the spirits of the wild that gave themselves in the fight against Jormag.
---
Thief I'd like a shadowmage that uses scepter and focus. They'd use shadows to attack and flank foes while facing them or teleport allies and enemies alike.
---
Ranger I'd like to see a beastmaster type spec that summons and controls more animals like a pack leader.
---
For warrior I'd like a sorta Paragon like elite spec that uses adrenaline to shout buffs to allies or heal them, giving them chants or mantras. I'm not big on warrior so this might not be most warrior's style but a more combat healer is what I'm getting at... Idk probably not needed in the current meta.
---
Guardians I'd like to see something more akin to a Paladin. Pushing the front line and taunting enemies to attack them and them alone. Using a sort of retaliation build that warps their own means of righting and taking damage as a retribution type fighter.
---
Warrior and Guardian I'm not too sure on... Sorry comrades. I'm not 100% on what direction most should go aside from Necromancer, Mesmer and Engineer.
---
Closest you're going to find as light armor legs is T1 or T2 cultural, and the Tribal chestpiece (from pvp/wvw Legacy reward track). Primitive set from karma vendors may also have some useful pieces. 
---
wait the personal story? o friend.....the personal story was the weak part of the game......do you have fun ahead of you :P
---
map is beautiful and the metas are fun for me, hearts however are not interesting and even the rewards are a big meh this patch, with minimal minis and a potion. nothing fun or unique. guess more effort went into the weapon collections than splitting them up. and once again same as episode 4 the heart vendors only sell single item of the currency instead of a bundle of 5 &gt;.&gt; 
---
I played it at launch on my ranger and later on my guardian, both before any changes and the second play through was so I could unlock arah 
---
Doing 2h /day is not that much for hobby.
---
That’s gold.
---
'' It can be worth doing it on long-term. Doing fractals every day for a week gives you +/- 100g, so that would be +/- 400g a week ''
---
Can you please explain the math here? Do you mean doing T4 + recs with four accounts every day? 
---
Revenant plays nothing like the ritualist, acts nothing like the ritualist and its them is only superficially similar. The closest we have mechanically to the ritualist would be Engineer or Scourge.
---
Ritualist are necromancers in our real world understanding of the term. Not a medium like the revenant but a full blown necromancer. In fact, Shamans which ritualist takes strong inspiration from were the precursors to the practices and beliefs of the necromancers in real world religious beliefs. This is why ritualists are seen in GW1 wearing bones, teeth, scales and furs. These were practices of Shamans and necromancers of our world. The dancing and shaking their weapons was also a part of their design, something the revenant severely lacks in its design.
---
Something to note about Necromancer design in gw1, they had less bones and teeth in their armor design than ritualist did in the first game wearing more leather looking armor as opposed to the shamanistic styles the ritualist had. But, funny thing, the necromancer in its armor design and choices as well as NPC representation have mostly adopted the design of more gw1 ritualists as opposed to the gw1 necromancer. This isn't 100% of course, Marjory being more like the gw1 necros in design be still taking more bones and feathers into it while trahearne was a departure of both.
---
But it is still very obvious that the necromancer has taken a more ritualistic identity in the past 250 years. Far more focused on spirits than they used to be.
---
For the longest time this feature did not exist and we couldn't salvage stacks of items (mostly for ecto salvaging, after Salvage All was implemented) until 2 patches ago.
---
Omg yes
---
He also absorbed Zhaitan and Mordremoth energy. There's a chance he can corrupt things as well now, just like how Kralk could raise dead stuff into minions due to Zhaitan magic.
---
I main a Thief and prefer to play it but I am unsure why you think I don't play support too? All but one of my Wing 4 and 5 CMs were done as support (Revenant kiter for Cairn and Deimos, Druid for Mursaat Overseer and Soulless Horror, Chrono for Dhuum) and I frequently play support when my static and training raids need me to.
---
Support in Guild Wars 2 is a very easy role. There is no finesse in healing, as there is in World of Warcraft outside of end of expansion moments when mana becomes less of an issue, since the game inherently doesn't support a triage or target selecting style of healing. There are no difficult choices you need to make as a healer because the UI, skills and boss design do not support it.
---
Chronomancer is also very easy to play in raids currently though its ability to hard carry a group has, thankfully, been toned down.
---
I'm still not sure why you think people in this game, where there is no gear or secondary profession system for a main character, don't have lots of alts if they raid... 
---
Don't worry about it. 
---
I wouldn't say it's 'wrong' exactly. A lot of people use LS as an abbreviation for Living Story.
---
The only real difference is that Victory or Death no longer requires 2+ players but instead can be solo'd. On top of that, a few of the later fights got nerfed, such as Sovereign Eye of Zhaitan and the airship battles against the dragon champions in Victory or Death (as well as the defend Zojja phase at the very end). And that was *before* the power creep brought to you by elite specs.
---
Oh, and Zhaitan's killed by spamming 1 instead of 2 now - they removed the aim changing on the cannons aka skills 1 and 3 (because why make it harder).
---
Though the actual Zhaitan barrage phase is slightly harder, particularly if you solo. As now the Tendrils of Zhaitan mobs reliable spawn in higher numbers, on top of Zhaitan's mass-damage well attacks occurring. They made everything easier and more boring until the very last phase, the most boring of them, and made that one a little harder (and arguably less boring?).
---
Ask Anet, not us.
---
Very true! However, I find that even that has limits when you have been clearing Spirit Vale for over 3 years. Sadly, the content also tends to be trivialised by power creep and the new raid setups and tactics are normally designed to turn the boss into a training golem (mid strat VG and up draft Gors being good examples that have been done that way for years). 
---
They are both equally useful, but I'd prefer leaving DH as power class and SB as condi. First because this iteration is easier to master than the other way around. Rotations are easier, so you'll do more damage by not wasting so much time or skills.   
---
Second, DH will let you pull mobs and offer overall more utility in fractals than a soulbeast. While in raids, for fights that favor condi dps, SB will pull ahead due to the constant dmg output and how hard it is to f\*\*k up its rotation.
---
The Asgard are among us!
---
Say no to blind invites. Always.
---
I need to play new classes but I think the problem is I dont know what I want haha
---
That way to enter raids is still a lot more difficult than selecting the LFR option in an inbuilt game UI though.
---
I firmly disagree regarding the composition. We've have 3+ years of Chronomancer/Druid/Warrior because of unique buffs in spirits and banners and only chronomancer can bring alacrity and quickness together.
---
WoW had similar issues back in the first expansion due to abilities that Shadow Priests and Shaman could bring but there was still some flexibility within your choice of healers, dps and tanks. The issues forcing these classes into compositions were also addressed by the next expansion. In GW2, similar concerns are unfortunately ignored by ArenaNet. 
---
So are you running your 65% BD build and gain 20% more from agony resist for fractals or are you trying to hit 100% with another gear setup?
---
Oh I didn't know that! I will surely save up for them since I really like how the story is developing. Thanks!
---
I left, no reason to spend even more time for this. Do you like the huge new empty map, with nothing to do with it, other than farm new currency for new carrots? It is the illusion of content and yes, the game is clearly dying, they are working on another product, while sucking the last bucks from this pice of crap. They are not working on stuff which people really want (build templates for example), because it is too much of an investment for a product which is at the end of the cycle. Better do some more new skins and systems which enchance the skin sales (gliders, mounts, novelties). I liked them, but the real reason why they added them is to increase the amount of crap players can buy and that is all.
---
You can simply increase the number you're buying at the vendor which is a maximum of 5 per heart
---
For the first setup: Diviner armor with pack runes, zerk trinkets and weapons, all infusions are mighty, sigil of concentration/sigil of force, Insp/Duel/Chrono. It's just the same thing that chronos usually run except you run diviners armor for more boon duration. With diviners you don't lose nearly as much damage as you would if you ran commanders. Want more damage and are confident people won't miss your wells/tot? Then do less diviners and use more zerk/assassin stats. Not confident at all? Use more diviners. Full screen is also an option for youtube so you don't have to squint.
---
Nah. Every MMO is a breathing community made of casuals and hardcores. Casuals need hardcores and hardcores need casuals. Do you think people would do hardcore stuff like 3 man VG or solo MAMA or 1 finger lupicus if there was nobody to see the vidoe? I dont think so. Same goes for casuals, MMO without the hardcore community at the top, is just a "fun game" which will be forgoten fast. When hardcores start to leave in masses, that is the point when game is rekt, which was a year ago. We only go south from here.
---
I'll personally be using as much bd as I can get now that diviners is available for the Qadim fight since I take portal for getting back to Qadim quickly and to skip the jp at the end of the fight.
---
Sure, pm me the accountname. approved carry here. ;)

For your 2nd and 3rd linked video, I assume [this](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vhAQJAsensICFohlfC+pBEgilVj6sJSiioeZj2ptcDGhAA-jRSBQBjUJIlUB5KKdIy+DiS9DyoMaiPAAAcCAwjeg5BBATAYVlqqqSIgRjBA-e) would be the build if no spotter? I managed to get to the exact crit cap, just not sure if it can be optimized further.
---
Build [with](http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/?vhAQJAsensICFohlfC+pBEgilVj6sJSiiocDGhAoeZj2pF-jRSBQBUSFGRp+wVU+NxHAAAOBAFSHgZUCiHtAEZ/hAAHAn38A48zP/8zPvmf+5nf+5nf+5nXIgRjBA-e) spotter for reference.
---
I had the same feeling when I finished it for a first time years ago,  this screen still brings nostalgia and that time I also thought it was so good! Go further into a story after this is (read about S1 from wikipedia) then play S2 Living world story, Heart of Throne Expansion, S3, Path of Fire expansion and S4 of living world story. You will enjoy it even more, it is quite a long ride if you won't rush it, but you won't regret it, everything has more or less flaws, but you will have lots of fun if you enjoyed game and basic story so far ;3
---
I need them all  for my freeze look :D [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r309XPdLfs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r309XPdLfs)
---
Welcome to the GW2 of different speed and perspective XD If you love raptor, you will enjoy all other mounts too 
---
Personally: no. I already feel fractals take long enough. However if you're having fun, fractals are one of the more profitable places to spend your gw2 time
---
it is a music box

---
if 100CM is too hard for you, try a lower difficulty fractal.
---
You only have his word that it was his thumb...
---
I suspect what he means is that if you do T4 Fractals for a week you earn about ~ 100g.  This is mostly from a combination of the daily chests and 30 discounted fractal encryption keys per day which usually break even cost-wise.  So consistently doing T4 dailies across the course of a month earns you about ~ 300-400g (and double that if you do a second set).  
---
As for the original question.  It can be worth it if you get good groups and clear in 30-40m.  If you're mostly in bad groups that take upwards of an hour to clear and really struggle then I wouldn't bother.  However, if you're in groups that struggle and wipe multiple times per encounter then it'd be best to just do some open world farming instead. 
---
Nope you're not alone
---
[Relevant SoundCloud link.](https://soundcloud.com/arenanet/fer-naw-this-evenin-by-the-soggy-joko-brothers)
---
I burnt out so quickly doing this. 
---
Not my job to read the episodes for you, feel free to play through and actually listen to the lore and dialogue this time.
---
Basically .. it is just not optimized .. if you upgrade, can I have your old one (lol)   
---
I get the same frames on my old machine as my new one.. (okay maybe 5 frames better) and dual 1080's make no difference at all.  it is just not optimized.. at all to take advantage of I7 -I9 .. at all . 
---
And PoFs story of even better! 
---
You can be sure that most of us were blown away but how good they are and this is coming from someone who was against the idea of mounts in the game. Though, as like others, my "being against" was coming from my experience with mounts in other games but here, instead, Anet really out-done themselves
---
Get the rest of the mounts, all of them add a new way of moving around which really helps wih the experience, even in old maps
---
What about a single chrono in full boon duration gear? How much quickness and alacrity uptime do we get? 
---
This is not just important for fractals, but also for raid pugs where it's very hard to find chronos. Better to replace one chrono with an additional healer anyway.
---
There are a lot of random characters from other (Order) storylines as well as racial stories. If you play through it several times, taking different paths and such, it comes together better.
---
Something to consider is that while a lot of the comments here are true, beserker is generally better as condi and condi is expensive, I think a better comparison is base warrior vs dragon hunter.
---
I'm not sure if you're totally new to this game, but warrior is significantly more forgiving than guardian. In open world, a warrior will generally have 25k+ health whereas a guardian will have 15 or so, guardians rely a lot more on damage mitigation and using skills to avoid things whereas warriors can generally just walk around and whack things until they die.
---
Personally for my first character I'd go warrior, just due to the fact that it'll be elss frustrating, and you will be able to solo champs. You CAN do it on a guardian, but it requires you to be much better at the game.
---
This is coming from someone whose first class was a guardian. 
---
So much this, it's so worth it to watch this before jumping into season 2. 
---
??? It’s in the shiverpeaks
---
wait wtf?!  
---
what exactly is impolite about a blind invite?  
---
the invite itself implies the question 'hey do you wanna group up with me'.  
---
since when is it impolite to ask other people something?
---
diviner + a few assassin's pieces on chrono + 18 precise infusion seems to be the best combination in fractals, at least that's what I got from discretize's gear optimizer. And it's understandable because slaying pots, butternut and damage multipliers are much much more valuabke than raw stats. I get up to 97% crit chance with 192AR
---
I've never heard of anything like that happening outside of the first few days when the expansion launched. Does it happen when you try it solo?
---
that would be sad when true.
---
I just did that story mission on my alt the other day and had no issues. Try repairing game files and check your internet connection.
---
It partly does, the room you can see if you look through the window next to Taimi has the exact same it should have and quite a few of the platforms are still there if you manage to break out of the map. The side rooms aren't there however.
---
A map covered in snow doesnt count towards the desert, who would have thought ;)
---
Thank you, I've been playing for 3 months but my highest lvl was like 30+ (don't ask, trying to make that *original and the best* chara and deleting them daily cuz of eye color for example...) but for now I think warrior would be the better option due to design of my oc and I'm happy hearing that he's quite easy too ^^
---
Holy crap the absolute MADMEN
---
You played wow and say gw2 takes the longest to level? What? How?
---
It's just a VG green, basically.  Luckily, most players that do T4 Fractals have raided at one point or another. 
---
Have you ever done it yourself?
---
In your calculations, you seem to ignore the duration of the split itself? (70s is only the duration between splits, but a loop will last 70s +split duration), it doesn't change much but should be taken into consideration. 
---
If you've got some decent boon-strip and burst it probably isn't that bad.  I've mostly just played Necromancer for Siren's Reef when pugging.  Being able to carry via boon-corrupt and blood magic is really helpful for players that eat most of the condition pressure or platform AoEs.  Most of the difficulty will just be players realizing what they need to dodge.  If you don't have a steady source of strip for protection while no pain no gain is active then pretty much any fractal will be much harder than it needs to be. 
---
Well, and I play GW2 daily with zero disconnects so I thought I'd mention checking the internet just in case. :)
---
Oh thank god. The underground areas are hard to navigate. You're a saint for making this :P
---
Just keep in mind anet policy: https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/65546/policy-dual-or-multi-boxing
---
Its obtuse because hiding progression means more time to impulse buy lootboxes.
---
I prefer the requiem method, at least its not rng driven.
---
Its a common bug tbh. Happens a lot. Still looks cool
---
Thanks anyways :)
---
Well, Chrysanthea at least has a chance to show up again if they decide to implement her and the Nightmare Court factions into the Malyck storyline outline which Matthew Medina has been working on for some time now. :)
---
You should really read or play some better story orientated things
---
i get that and dont disagree with that, but still don't understand why a blind invite would be inherently impolite.  
---
it just seems neutral to me, sure you could send a message with it, that would certainly be the more social/friendly approach, but that doesnt necessarily mean that its impolite to just send the invite.
---
And then it all goes downhill from there
---
Like REEEALLY downhill, like *woah*
---
I thought about this also, since those stories are pretty expensive.
---
I think if you take into account running alts through the map mining nodes, map completion, plus the repeatable WvW/PvP reward tracks which give you 50, you would probably fall short on the gems still.
---
I usually keep a stack of WvW reward potions for cases where I want to finish a reward track asap.  Many WvWers do so it seems, which helps out here.
---
Bring back HoT style maps! I can't walk 10m without getting sucked in to some event.
---
Aside from playing really niche roaming builds and fighting other skilled players with it, even WvW doesn't require a min-max'd stat set. Especially in group play, you can get away with exotics and cheapo runes/sigils. The skill gap is so huge that unless you are fighting an equally skilled opponent/build, the gear doesn't matter that much.
---
That goes doubly so for guild play. A better group can stomp lesser groups with far less players, never mind requiring min-max'd gear.
---
I think this system is great tbh, as you get a motivation to work towards (better gear = win more 50/50 fights) getting gear, but also not feel hopelessly inadequate with lesser gear (you can run on an alt with shitty trading post exotics as long as you build semi-appropriately for the stats available, and if you play with one friend the 2v2 and above situation is basically down to skill rather than gear).
---
Always at x:45. 2 Metas, so still 2h cycle.
---
You don't have to spend a lot of time in game, you just have to made sure the time you do spend is used effectively. 30 min a day for 1 year and you could have a legendary. Most likely less
---
Haven't thought about it that way. Thanks!
---
Hmm, I'm pretty sure one of the devs called Kralk her Aurene's "daddy". :o
---
ugly
---
I think its worth it. I do T4s+CMs+Recs on my main everyday and it ends up being roughly 25-30g/day, I also do T4s on my alt account which is an additional 10-12g/day. 
---
In total the T4s/CMs/Recs on my main takes me about 45-50mins/day with my fractal static and the T4s on my alt generally takes 25-30mins since I usually run them with friends who are also doing it on alts. In total I spend ~75-85mins on average in fractals each day and make anywhere from 35g-47g/day. This number goes up if if you get good RNG drops like mystic coins, T7 Ascended Mats, etc. 
---
My main account does have Fractal God, which greatly increases how much gold I make each day as I get an additional 4 boxes/fractal, so from a normal day I'd get an extra 32 boxes.
---
big sad if true
---
Canach says "in Elona gambling is allowed" when we meet him in the fighting pit. This suggests that for some reason game identifies THK as part of Elona.
---
I wish I had friends
---
i think this won´t be a problem on this map because you can buy the meta related object on the TP.  
---
While people do the meta, you have a healthy population for your mats gain, but if people stop dooing them the prices of the plates will rise again and give people a raw gold reason to do the meta bringing back the population.
---
&gt;  like could i realistically catch up?
---
like stated there is not really any catching up in this game. It doesnt have any notable necessary gear grind that keeps going. 
---
The only thing to catch up on is the story and you can do that in your own time (this is what brings you masteries like gliding etc). Except for living world s 1 but you can watch it on youtube. 
---
Getting the expansions and living world episodes is worth it if you enjoyed the base game imo. 
---
You can unlock living world with in game gold to gems system. 
---
I would suggest not to insta boost to 80. There is no hurry and you miss out on game mechanics and will be dropped into the world more confused. Level at least one character of your preferred profession before boosting another. 
---
Oh boy you’re in for a treat! It gets a lot better. 😎

And Bitterfrost Frontier counts towards shiverpeaks obviously

No.

If you're lot, i can recommend you to check the subreddit wiki, it haved links to all the info for rewturning playeros, also links to sites with build and that kind of stuff. Enjoy your time on the game and weocome back! 😀
---
It’s most certainly dodgy in EU too - take ages for anything to load. Even the gem store is crazy slow. 
---
Buying keys over 20s is stupid, why would you buy them with matrices which are worth 30-40silver?
---
Are you leaving the playable area? I remember some path of fire story having really tight zone borders and I got kicked out several times 
---
Was it for deaf people?
---
They had a solution for this in LW3 already. Rata Novus was a cool starting point for most of the episodes. 
---
Anyone who treats you as a neutral NPC deserves to be treated as an evil NPC.
---
I loved HoT and PoF story mode but the main story felt dull to me personally. Final mission was basically press F to kill Zhaitan (mounted turrets) though I enjoyed defending the ship from minions on board. 
---
I think these items should not take up inventory space.
---
Can't blame him, there are *Crystal Desert* Mastery Insights in the middle of the snowy mountains!

According to [gw2efficiency](https://gw2efficiency.com/account/unlock-statistics?filter.search=chasing) it seems only "Chasing Tales: Asaliea the Channeler" hasnt been completed by anybody of its userbase.

Yu meant Glint right?
---
/u/TheCheatsrichter  So the account list in cinematic mode looks better than before especially with Avatars not being so big, but there was 1 change that really bothered me.  
---
Like how just left clicking on an account 1 after another forces it to select it.  When in cinematic mode before it would just select the one, and if you wanted to select more you had to hold Ctrl and then click.
---
The problem with the current design is that there is no way to clear your selection without deselecting the previous accounts you had launched.  This is why having Ctrl + Click was ideal.  Maybe an option in LB Settings in a later release?
---
Never known anyone to use Glint's other name out of story @.@
---
Anet and inconsistency is not a new thing
---
I don't get why they *don't* stack, beyond mystic forge recipes.
---
Thank you very much. I'm currently trying to complete the golem and this is one of the last thing I miss
---
Its a slow process, and honestly quite frustrating. But Im not yet giving up hope that "even pugs" will realize how absolutely op boons are. And how easy it is to get all boons from start to finish of each boss encounter with firebrands, renegade and druid.
---
I mean, why would you atm even want to bring a chrono in a pug squad? You need 2 healers anyway because you always have at least 2 dps face tanking everything. You cant tank with 1.3k toughness because doing so means you need your distorts etc for yourself instead of others, and the squaddps isnt high enough to phase bosses fast enough. Not to mention your healers are busy healing that DE standing just beside you face tanking everything - literally. So that leaves at the most offchrono spot for a bit of dps shenanigans. But 15k on golem? Meh. You're gonna outdps that on a power quickbrand. Since you need shield on each chrono build, bringing focus for pulls hurts your dps a lot - to the point its just not even worth it anymore to bother and just take full harriers for extra healing from mantra/heal well.
---
BUT WAIT you might want to say... who is going to TANK if not chrono? Well guess what. You just let the renegade tank and supply aegis+stability with firebrands to smooth over that cooldown of crushing TWELVE SECONDS in between staff3 blocks. Or healfirebrand tanks with mace. Except VG (mid strat), tanking on healfirebrand is so trivial, with the added benefit that you usually have everyone in mantra cone range neatly stacked up.
---
So yeah... Im not giving up yet. And maybe anet will help some more by nerfing SoI, making it 2sec base duration and affected by boon duration. Ouch.
---
Use Marauder armour with some runes that give vitality, dagger + warhorn, traits that make your auras heal, and the shouts that give auras as your utilities.  Makes Tempest Elementalists hard to kill without decreasing their damage by too much.
---
The poor man's griffon
---
I keep on disconnecting during story mission instances, particularly at the end of cutscenes - is this a common issue? Is there a fix? It's not a problem with my internet connection!
---
Can't promise anything. Friday and saturday were unfortunatly failed. But they were good attempts. I suppose the guys who were there will come back. It will be easier tonight. We just have to be patient. Time for people to get used with this new regular organised event.
---
Apparently useful enough for people to order them
---
&gt; I don't know how many MMO's you played but the core main story of GW 2
---
Tell me a few of those mmos with a decent vanilla story. Cause I don't know any.
---
We are at an technological age where an rtx 2080ti manages to pull barely 60fps on ultra settings on 4k on really optimized games (look at ac odyssey's result.. barely 40 fps). Needless to say most mmorpgs are not optimized. I'd say we are currently at the 1440p Mainstream and if we want to believe the nvidia ceo we will go back to 1080p with alot enhanced details which might rival 4k in its aesthetics.
---
Hope i could make it clear to you that you can run the game perfectly fine and still very good looking without the need of any investment.
---
The only optimized game (mmo) so far i've encountered was Destiny 2 and that still drops below 60fps from times to times (ultra settings)
---
I myself did not even need to oc my cpu and im just using an r7 2700x ryzen cpu. My gpu overclocks itself automatically (factory oc)
---
Since you are overclocking your components do you use a custom loop watercooling solution? Or 2 All in One Watercoolings for cpu and gpu respectivly (i do that).
---
I'd look at that options as you (if you really wish) can match an rtx 2080ti with an 1080ti with 20-30% overclock. Also under non stress it keeps your system quiet and prolongs the lifespan of the components. 
---
Yeah, I had to keep jumping instances to be solo in the room or else it was only spawning for one player at a time and taking forever. But today, the purple room kept giving me the purple plate lmao 4x in a row... Never did get the right color. 
---
To think the fate of the world hangs by a thread over a family quarrel
---
It's like when I was 7 and I refused to answer to anything other than "Buffy" because I wanted to be an kick-ass Slayer and my parents were like "lol, No. Loser!" 
---
Just me? 
---
i was so, so confused the first time through until i grasped that it was originally meant for groups. &gt;&lt;
---
Well, there were 'Heart of Maguuma' masteries in the Shiverpeaks, Kryta, Orr, and the Ring of Fire as well.
---
I just don't go to redit or twitter or youtube at all till im done with the episode. Also as soon as I log into the game I turn off map chat. I only use /s chat for events and read npc dialogue. 
---
The only reason to do both sets is having both skin sets.
---
I kept getting purple plates from him today....even though he IS the purple room lmao. 
---
If you were, you would adapt. 
---
[Here is a screenshot of my history](https://imgur.com/a/MFX5SJl) , seems like it loads the lowest bid first (I tested it you cant put an order at 12c) and then loads the highest , you usually don't notice it because it changes really fast, but with the lags it takes several seconds.
---
They only need to set a few areas in which it is disabled, like floating platforms over the void, which they mostly already did, and are going to do for the missing spots.
---
That looks like a necromancer.
---
I got the 4 mobs one during a meta, but that 10% one seems hopeless.. It's so hard to stay that low and kill 5 and trying to dodge every hit. Are we allowed to go down then rev ourselves back up then drop to 10% and continue killing or can you not go down at all?! 
---
What if the video is of 1 vision. The vision being the loop in time keeping kralk at bay? Remember caithe saying she can feel something different or new about aurene after you both step out of the portals? Rember it being 2 days but to us felt way less? Maybe aurene is in a statis? Great post. Lots of food for thought. 
---
Necromancer is the best at soloing the open world out of those, primarily with the HoT Elite Spec, known as Reaper, and using minions. 
---
Guardian is pretty solid, too. Especially as the HoT Elite Spec known as Dragon Hunter. Though it can't solo as well as Necromancer, it is a really good build for Fractals and higher, if you plan to get into that. 
---
The open world is soloable by pretty much every class, the only difference being that Necromancer lets you turn off your brain; it's more forgiving, and can solo things others cannot. But it isn't as desired for group content. So that's a trade-off you'll have to consider. 
---
I would ultimately choose the class/spec you enjoy most, and play that. Better to have a more enjoyable, but limited character. Than playing a class/spec that can achieve more, but you find to be mediocre to play. 
---
I would look at what you want from a character; for instance Necromancers are one of the slowest characters, and since you don't have mounts (due to no PoF) you don't have a good way to mitigate that. 
---
If I were you, I'd look at all the classes, as some have changed quite a bit, such as Revenant and their Upkeeps being cheaper -- which is the class I'm currently leveling. As someone without mounts, I'm loving the Shiro Upkeep 'Impossible Odds', which lets me keep up Superspeed on myself for the vast amount of my time travelling, and since it's Superspeed and not Swiftness, I'm barely slowed by combat! Additionally, Revenant can break Defiance Bars really well in the open world, by using the Staff. And Defiance Bars is something you'll find on pretty much every hard-to-solo boss. 
---
I run full Berserker in my static. The slower the kills are the more boonduration you'll need.
---
And that is _exactly_ why I want to /gg
---
that happens normally during tequatl :)
---
65.8% is already plenty in my opinion but with boonduration being so easily and efficiently obtainable now I wouldn't mind if people just went full Diviner's.
---
Hey Wulfric, I’ve been on a couple of your HP runs and there well run and newbie friendly, no disappearing into the distance on a griffin! I highly recommend to anyone.
---
Damn, I didn't notice that. 
---
If you carefully read the post you should be able to answer that yourself (:
---
"NO DADDY, I'M NOT GLAUST, I AM CRYSTAL PRINCESS THE FABULOUS"
---

"Goddamit that sounds so stupid, I'm changing my name to Glint"

And that's exactly why it won't be implemented.
---
If yu get downed in pvp, it just means yur outmatched.
---
If the opponent knows how to capitalize on it to win, then that's just how pvp works. 
---
It's a vanity item, there's market for that
---
Need a stack of Destroyer Cores to join his squad.
---
Thanks for this, I will link it around because there is a lot of confusion about chrono right now, I really hope this helps clarify things a bit! I think it's also important to consider that on some fights swapping back to a double well setup mighht be a good idea, for example on sloth, where people's boons might get corrupted, or on fights where people have to move around because of mechanics a lot, like Dhuum or Matthias.
---
Have you tested other setups though? I've been talking with a friend who loves to do math and spreadsheets and by every account something like this does more damage with the same boonduration:
---
http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vhAQJAsNA-jRCBQBGSLAU1BAgTAQaVCqVVKCwDAYUqrQj9HIryvAAJAzUZKAmpZammpZamqMNTz0MNTz0MNTz0MVKA90aB-e
---
Even at 80% boonduration it seems running full diviner with one zerk piece and eagle runes is stilkl betetr than pack, the lower the boonduration though, the wider the gap. Obviously fractals are another story, but since the sixth buff on Pack is all but useless in raids, why not run that instead?
---
There’s a 5th downed ability!?
---
Thank you for using mimic and explaining why it’s generally better. 
---
However, there are fights where running both Wells is superior (running duel/Illu, largos twins). In such cases, what’s the optimal, safe and standard setup you recommend? 
---
I’ve been running 35% boon Duration with mimic in most fights, only changing to use firebrand runes to make up for the loss of quickness when I have to run both Wells. 
---
Also, as a side note, is it still safe to assume 5 casts of WoA when running Illusions? From what I’ve been testing, running illusions only lets you cast 3 WoA, before CS is back off cooldown. Using the 4th WoA seems to delay CS by quite a bit. Is it still worth waiting for the 4th non-CS WoA?
---
A lot of questions, I know. Thanks again, it was nice having some confirmation that Mimic IS indeed still better in most fights where you can stack together as a team
---
I am reminded to finish Quip, thanks! :D
---
Huh, not just Ember Bay it seems. Just checked the wiki and
---
&gt;Viewing vistas and gathering nodes on the Ring of Fire maps mechanically count as Heart of Maguuma dailies.
---
I had no idea about this. I stand corrected on that but still Bitterfrost counts as Shiverpeaks, Doric counts as Kryta and Siren's Landing counts as Orr so it's not unheard of that LS maps count as some other region than their expansion.
---
yeah, but rigth above it is mine rifle with 9 completion .... while asking for 30 kills -so probably bugged not from start but somewhere along the line
---
you should defently get the [kasmeer mount](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp0xxP5zmEc) 
---
Fights where I play double well are SH &amp; Largos, but I'd play Illu/Chaos Condi Chrono with Viper Gear, Firebrand Runes, Concentration/Malice and toxic oil. But this isn't a "safe" setup as it is quite tight.
---
It was never safe to assume casting 5 WoA in one illusions loop. It's barely safe to assume that without Illusions.
---
boing boing boing  
---
Already named few above but FFXIV, ESO, SWTOR, BnS I think have better core story.
---
It’s disguisting that your and Aemilia’s posts with valid issues gets downvoted and buried while people spouting hollow phrases like 'git gud' are considered a good addition to the discussion judging by the vote count.
---
Yeah, it’s the best ability in the game. 
---
I've never said I'd be holding out for this to be a thing. I'd like PvP to be balanced and devoid of bots, too: can I get some more downvotes? :\^)
---
OK, thanks for your advice.
---
TBH I want to have a go at dungeons and fractals this time around but also want to do open world content.
---
Is there a chronomancer build or couple of builds which are easy to switch between so I can do either?
---
I would imagine if I do join raids I would need to be of some use to the group hence why I was thinking boons.
---
&gt;What are benefits to running the Discipline version/When do you use that trait line?
---
It's in the "Guide" section for the class, but mainly you'll run the regular BS build, the one with tactics traitline, to give "Empower allies" whenever there are enough pDPS player to make the most out of the trait. The condi build, the one with discipline traitline but with banners, is a personal dps gain when you're in a raid squad with none or almost none pDPS players that can significantly benefit from it.
---
As for your second question, I'm not entirely sure, it's probably just a minmax thing and Malice should still be good enough. I don't think they explained the change anywhere, so it's probably just a minor difference in dps.
---
Please explain how he isn’t good enough to handle it. Because right now it appears as if you’re saying that you mustn’t be frustrated by any design choice, no matter how well the implementation is. 
---
Yes it still does it and on all races
---
I think you missed the 'open world' part where 90% there are no buffs to get. 
---
It's so difficult to choose what to spend gems on because there is so many useful things on the gem store. I'm looking at buying 1600 gems for £17 but i'm torn on what to spend them on (I already own both expansions).
---
On the one hand I really want more character slots because I'm an altoholic who hasn't yet found a class to call home yet. Of my 5 current character slots I have 3 level 80s (Revenant, Engineer, Ranger), a level 45 Elementalist, and a lvl 15 Guardian that I am currently playing.
---
I do want to also have a Warrior and possibly a thief which is what I want character slots for.
---
On the flip side there are other useful things like storage expander and more inventory/bank space. 
---
What's also pressing is I am missing quite a few living world episodes. In living world season 2 I only have episode 7, so I miss episodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8.
---
In living world season 3 I don't have episodes 1, 2, 4, or 6. I've been a bit better at logging in for season 4 so I only miss episode 1, I have the others. 
---
I haven't really done any living world stuff on my 80s. The furthest I have got is just to get to the first area of the Path of Fire expansion, I still haven't touched Heart of Thorns, so I don't know how urgently I need all of those missing episodes.
---
All of this is not even getting into the home instance crafting/gathering nodes but I'm not too worried about those since I don't have a home instance of any character yet.
---
I suppose I could get 1 character slot now and use the remaining gems for other things but any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated! 
---
PS: How often do the promotions change? Weekly? Monthly?
---
calculate manually? diviners has conc mainstat. so you get the same amount of conc as you would get power or condi dmg in full viper.
---
90% of Metabattle's 'open world' builds are crippled raid DPS builds with no way of providing their own boons. They're *terrible.*
---
to be fair, the only way the fate of the world could end in "not consumed" is because of the family quarrel
---
I don't know the formula to translate the static value to percentage. 
---
Do it daily for a month, see how fun it seems after that.
---
&gt; Chrono Shatter build
---
That sounds very familiar.
---
I think I may run with a power chrono for the moment.
---
Only problem is my inventory is giving me headaches at the moment - not sure what most of the stuff is lol
---
&gt;I have been recently getting stuck in walls inside story instances.
---
I have no idea what you are doing, I never stucked in any story instance. 
---
Do you play a certain class or trying to explore places where we shouldn't go or something?
---
However, try using /stuck and wait don't move for a bit. It helps.
---
I wish I could /gg in real life
---
Its every 15 points in Concentration = 1% Boon Duration 
---
Thanks, I'll try to do it manually then. 
---
Also, if we look at gw2skills there's a pvp option, I think divines is available as a pvp amulet. That should give you the numbers you're after. 
---
Anywhere would be better. The other day I was doing Chalice of Tears and happened to fall somewhere near the top into a small crevice that I could not die in. And it took me almost 30 minutes to climb back out by glitching up the sides of rocks. 
---
How about you spent the time you invest in trying to look smart and explaining something I already know on reading what I wrote in each of my comments.
---
1. I asked you what I'm doing wrong if I do everything listed ( big chest+ 2 metas + 13 invisible small ones) and being 50% of your claimed 6 per day. Not for an explanation to find these things.
---
2. If I say my personal drop is 3 per day, you don't need to tell me that this can't be my average. Ofc the average for every player has to be greater than 3, but I can assure you it is not 6.
---
3. If I already said I'm doing all options to get these jewels at the start it looks pretty stupid from you asking me if I do this after trying to impress me with general RNG bullshit
---
Some strategies include: stacking scourges so you can epidemic the adds, and standing in the middle of the boat so that you don't fall in the water when you get blown off.
---
&gt;It would probably be faster and more effective to contact them directly instead of using a fan-forum.
---
And what would that way of contacting them directly be? Official forums? This issue has been brought up repeatedly with other servers and clearly has not been fixed.
---
Your interest is not to improve or fix these issues. Your interest is to not discuss anything negative about GW2 publically, even if this harms the game. You'd rather pretend it's perfect than see a fix to common issues. 
---
Is this supposed to be a parody of all these theory posts popping up or is this just another one? I honestly can't tell anymore.
---
Tbh the puzzle itself is very short and easy, so I don't think he saved too much time. :) But it's cool to see other ways, so props for that
---
You beautiful bastard, I just got to run though this after my trip and now .. Now I am thinking if my character were to bury her, he would do so with all the toys he worked so hard to get for her..   
---
 .. goddamn tears 
---
It's a mastery from LW4 E4. Basically a signet gives your downed attacks lifeleech or you can activate it for an AoE.

Is it possible to bypass clicking each diamond reward for levelling up when levelling using tomes of knowledge? after my 10th character levels via tomes, it's driving me mad!
---
Adding mechanics to boss fights is fine. Even random ones. Making it take 20 minures to climb a fucking slope or jump up a pile of rocks isnt challenging or fun, its fucking stupid and obnoxious.
---
Thank you for making me laugh at work 😂
---
&gt;but it is not unreasonable to expect people to not spoil posts in titles
---
It's not unreasonable, but it is certainly futile. People will inevitably find a way to disappoint you.
---
Just after reset the other day I was working on murdering Pat with a few others when someone randomly cones in Map Chat and says something to the effect of "Where are we?" Given that I'm falling with style around Pat's little palace in the sky I reply back "Somewhere over the Rainbow" (I *was* way up high) and things sorta went downhill from there, with this person calling my unhelpful, and that normally the community is good except for occasional douche like me and me telling him he's rather vague and maybe next time he should be more clear.
---
Its not the first time this has happened and it won't be the last. I find that anyone that starts complaining about how unhelpful some members of the community are, are the ones that are actually the assholes. I farm flax in VB on reset with all my characters and often enough when someone invariably asks for help with the 3-4 problem HP's I'll help. If they make a vague request well, they're less likely to get help and more likely to get a joke instead.
---
So is there any reason OP is not running more Assasin's gear instead of Berserker's on the Diviner's armor setup? Is more crit not worth it at some points?
---
And those 2 reasons are either good ending or bad ending, it could have been either one easily. 
---
And the fact that your not home and bored at work/school or whatever doesn't change the fact that you know full well the episode released and there could be spoilers and 50% at the VERY LEAST of all LWS content contains spoilers of some form and you STILL went on reddit. 
---
IT'S YOUR OWN JOB TO PROTECT YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE NOT EVERYBODY ELSE'S
---
Now you know at least :) Be sure to keep away next episode ;)
---
WvW players amaze me with the lengths they go to spew vitriol against each other
---
Hmm, I just insta-died there. xD
---
This build above is a low rate of shatter build. Your focus is dodging to give active axe clones your Mirage Cloak (Infinite Horizons) to proc the ambush attack
---
Not that I know of, apart from using a level 80 boost.
---
Shaming people w/ comments like those is truly pathetic. 
---
I must have missed that. Thanks so much. Does it work for other people's gathering tools? I'm so tired of hearing that demon clown laugh and those damned skritt.
---
On a related note I keep getting stuck between the crystals that jut up from the ground in some parts of the new map
---
There's no point because you can't share the buffs so you're gonna do what, waste a potential healing / cc build to run around healing, having dmg reduction and being immune to stuns? Feels counterproductive. 
---
I think the website is offline or something
---
Why is there so much brand if Kralk supposedly hasn’t been there yet when we first enter the map?
---
relog if you cant see the boss
---
The Source of Orr didn't get new dialogue. The boss got massively tuned down a few months after release. Any epicness it has was moreso originally.
---
It was mostly Claw Island's arc that got new dialogue. And primarily Trahearne at that.

---
not everyone wants to do a captcha because you butthurts cry about "pvp bots" (doubt they even exist).
---
btw
---
the chance that one of those "bots" is in your enemy team is higher since you have 4 possible bots in your team but there are 5 possible bots in the enemy team
---
Sigh...I am in NA. I don't think I will ever get this achievement done. Very frustrating. 
---
oh so, that was a shark... 
---
It's 15-20 minutes of an event you do twice a day. If that's a lot of work why are you still playing?
---
I get you have to play the dungeons, but I feel like they should tell you that. Because I agree with the original commenter. I'm all for letting people play the game but everything was so rushed and the amount of ex-machina used was killing it for me. It was like the writers couldn't write a naturally flowing story so they had to suprise us with something new to keep things moving. I want to enjoy this games story, but I can't when I feel like they can't write characters or a fluid story.
---
There are many people hoarding tens-of-thousands of coins, and if the price starts to creep up, they will start to unload them for what they were at this LS. There will not be very much profit (% wise) to be made on coins. 
---
Alos, not to mention the bots in PvP tournaments. Although the season is not currently happening, there are many bots running tournaments throughout the PvP season and this brings a fairly large number of mystic coins into the game as well. 
---
I did so too in the first panel!
---
Eso is a bad mmo, but its got a great questing system and the main story IS better than gw2's, although not by much. 
---
Swtor is basically 8 bioware rpgs in a mmo. Each class has their own story with twists and you can actually change the story with your choices. Its only real good point in how its able to deliver such a great story in a mmo. Some of the classes stories are better than others, but theyre all pretty good, and if I made an average, Id say the story is better than gw2's too. Much better. 
---
Wait for a [TTS](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/afcjs2/when_was_the_last_time_someone_did_the_serpents/edxkssr/) run. They do it every week in NA.
---
No I think Aurene will be back next season and episode 6 will be darker with more deaths. Making next season a redemption arc for the commander. I like the idea of Aurene coming back but not that soon I want Anet to continue this and for us to fail again but this time even worse.
---
Thats like saying you really enjoyed the salad before the meal and then saying youre still hungry.

Youre going to love the rest of the story. It is lightyears better than vanilla.

i'd just like to complete a story instance without disconnecting 
---
Idk we did some things right!
---
8:30pm UTC or 21:30 french time ;) The answer is yes. today, next saturday, next sunday. Just like in the words ***every week-end*** =)
---
In fractals, power dps and cleave are heavily favored, and d/d daredevil can’t really do either of those. Have you tried staff?
---
I really hope she stays dead since I'm really tired of winning each and every time.
---
I suggest that you do following: (my personal suggestion)
---
* Keep playing normally, vanilla game, no level boost.
---
* Continue playing vanilla until it starts to be a bit boring or underwhelming.
---
* Look up YouTube videos giving a thorough summary of Living story season 1 and 2.
---
* Start playing HoT.
---
* Play living story season 3 if you care about the continuity of the story. Skip it if you desperately want mounts. 
---
* Start playing PoF.
---
* Do living story season 3 now if you skipped it. 
---
* Do living story season 4.
---
* Do living story season 2.
---
Tell your Griffon to stop pretending to be a springer please.
---
&gt;don't boost to level 80, finish the base game story first.
---
I was really curious about this - The lvl80 boost seemed like a "why would I want that, why not just level up naturally?"
---
Good to hear you say that. 
---
So basically I'll just continue to play the game normally and then I'll eventually make my way to expansions. Sounds like it makes sense. 
---
What about mounts though? Shouldn't I grab one? it looks like it makes the game much better?
---
awesome. thank you! 
---
I've got this bug before, for whatever reason the game treats you like you're on a griffon
---
Be careful, while using shortcuts within the JP is fine, breaking map borders can get you banned.
---
It's mentioned in the comment section on Dulfy.
---
If you get tired of walking and tping, add someone level 80 as a friend and go into party with him. Let him open the first mission in PoF and clear it for you, then you can buy a mount. Also recommendation: join a chill guild :)
---
or like that silver wast bug 
---
if you want to grab a mount, you need to be level 80 and play the first part of the Path of Fire story.
---
If you really feel compelled to do such, i suggest you make another character that you boost to level 80 and then complete the first chapter with that character to unlock mounts. instead of boosting your ''main'' character.
---
since the mounts are account bound you only need to do it with that one character.
---
 
---
Was the same case at LS3 episode 6, because they released two weapons.
---
i spoke to a mod a while back, told me it was intended as far as he knew. i suggest looking for a crafting guide if you want to make it 32 slot.
---
Geh I wonder why? LS mas aren't linked to the expansion necessarily, just look at season 3.
---
Every night, before I go to sleep...
---
I made the thread because that's not an option. I don't want to spend the time doing that.
---
I need to check if I unlocked them, but thanks for the heads up!
---
Thank you!
---
I thought it was fairly clear from the last two episodes that Aurene was *by no means ready* to actually face Kralkatorrik, but we had to rush things and fight him because he simply is growing far too powerful way too fast. We were literally against the ropes and we put everything on the line in a desperate final assault.....and we still failed catastrophically
---
And I honestly would argue that the Dragons are still pretty much forces of nature, and the fact they have personalities at all gives them a whole new dimension beyond mere plot devices of destruction
---
From the ramblings of his Risen minions Zhaitan wanted to rule above all things for eternity. Mordremoth repeatedly called himself "the world" and with his MO of cloning the dead as mordrem if seems he wanted to assimilate everything. Kralkatorrik shows that no matter how insanely powerful he's getting, he still fears the possibility of a world without him, and that means he still can be defeated eventually
---
But the mortal races *are* beneath His notice. He only cares about Aurene, another dragon. That's why He left as soon as she died. And she very much was not capable of going toe to toe with him. She was annoying and then got stomped. 
---
We were going to try epi bounce after three wipes with our normal group, but instead went to a Firebrand and the burning was so effective we finished it in one try.
---
Owow, nevermind that's not the same trick.  
---
Damn it's pretty cool
---
They can contribute, most people just play safe, which works counter to their goal, at least it isn't all 4 necro one healer anymore.
---
* Do them with your dailies group
---
* Use stricter requirements in LFG
---
* Find a static
---
* Suck it up
---
* Stop being a little bitch
---
explain me why they should get rewards for my efford?
---
This is when I hate the 2-3 month release schedule haha. I'm actually talking about how it just goes to a black screen obviously this could have been for dramatic effect but even after the instance if I'm not mistaken you can't talk to any of the main characters about what happened. 
---
&gt; Use stricter requirements in LFG
---
i already look for PDPS and they still dare to fucking join and since the group creator cant kick them they try to leech
---
&gt;I don't want to play unranked, because i'm trying to do some achievements.
---
Too late, you've already been playing unranked without realizing it since the last season ended. Offseason the unranked and 'ranked' queues are the same. 
---
I don't think you can fail that mission, I played it twice (once to get mount, second to get access to hero points).
---
The reveal was him being a seer. That he doesn't fit into small places was visible when his back poked out of the soil in Grothmar Wardowns in GW. Kralkatorrik gets extra disadvantage on any stealth checks he attempts. 
---
It was a joke because normally you wouldn't think of a seer as a being that can devastate entire landscapes on his own.
---
Recs are so fucking ez and quick that if you honestly need a proper comp you must really suck since one good player can single handedly carry them.
---
So let me get this straight. You are complaining that people aren't killing things fast enough, in lower-tier fractals where things *melt* with just a stern glare? What are you going to do with the 10 extra seconds you have, ping legendaries in LA?
---
Looking at how you complain about people 'getting reward for my efford', maybe you should solo the daily recs, that way you get no leechers. After all, you're clearly a top-tier player who don't need no leech 😂
---
its not that i cant carry them but i dont want them to get rewards for my efford
---
ranked games in off season still count for ranked game wins for achievements
---
You wouldn't say that if it was YOUR thumb! :D
---
Just for kicks, right-click and check the properties of the executable you are running (GW2.exe) and make sure you're not running in Compatibility Mode. Also uncheck Disable Fullscreen Optimizations if it is checked.
---
Why should you get rewards for the other 4 players carrying you? 
---
Tbh if you only plan to do that then might as well play the class you like, regardless of how squishy it is. Leveling content is quite easy and ele is still fairly mobile (especially with daggers) in &lt;80 levels compared to some of other classes. You cant know until you try, different people will have different opinions and experiences.
---
You can blame ANet's new writer. Some Martin guy, had some tv experience or something.
---
i still get chills whenever i see footage of escaping lion's arch. it was such a weird and fun time!
---
What if Braham was shape shifting as a leopard at the time?
---
I'd answer the same if someone asked me if E5 was the last Episode of S4, considering S2 and S3 both had 6 Episodes...
---
When the season starts again will the ranks reset? I didn't feel like playing PvP at the last 2 weeks, or so, of the season, and my decoy reach -700.
---
Don't tell me I'll have that when next season starts.
---
how do you assume that i get carried if i have over 50% total damage?
---
Season 2 had 8. 
---
50% of all the incoming damage isn't something to be proud of 
---
yea my bad, i just looked it up and realized i was wrong ^^
---
Why should you? Are you being an idiot on purpose? 
---
Its 5 person content, you need 5 people, necro might not be as dpsy as other classes but its fine, its not a disaster like you seem to want to believe it to be. 
---
They dont need you. You arent carrying them. You could be gone and another player at your place and it would be the same. In a group, everyone just benefit from the others. You might not benefit from some necro a few times, thats fine, im sure some other player would say the same about you. 
---
Get over yourself dude. Its not healthy. 
---
Wow... I've had some issues before but didn't expect that one to be able to occur
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Lion_Chest/Drop_rate
---
The low-effort trolling on this sub is getting out of hand. 
---
I'm hoping they added some of the old polearm skins as spears.
---
it was an example...
---
we all know those people who clearly leech. there should be a way to prevent their rewards or get at least a cut.
---
now you really want to tell me that you never had a leecher(s) in y our group?
---
the fact that youre acting like everything is about dps tells a lot
---
Quite bluntly. You sound like a bit of a dick.
---
I used to run fractals every day and I have 5 accounts, but my friends have long since all quit. If you guys are open to taking in a wandering fractal vet, please hit me up! My in game name is Wonderbouter. I usually try to run fractals 40 mins or so after reset (after Teq and Anomaly)
---
Ahhh. That makes sense and explains how did we get over 10000 war scores in a single skirmish.
---
Ohhhhhhhh ok. Thanks for clarifying! That was a bit or a /r/woosh for me! 
---
ackchyually, it's *r/woooosh

---
In lower tier fractals, yeah everything is about dps and boons
---
Yes. You have to do your placements at the start of every season.
---
No, you will have placement games again, when the new season starts
---
I have a plush guild golem I sleep with.
---
its about reaper.
---
since you did barrier at vg i assume it was 1 druid + you or anything else which means you didnt waste a dps slot
---
&gt; Sylvari are just elves
---
Don't be misled by the nature association. Humans are elves, Sylvari are humans. The humans are a race that once had many powerful nations, but have now fallen. Their gods have abandoned them, but many still cling to the old traditions. Sylvari are the youngest race, curious and inquisitive. They are still trying to find their place in the world, and the other races aren't quite certain what to make of them.
---
DPS is a shallow, one-dimensional measurement of team contribution.  It's one thing when you need to hit certain DPS thresholds in Fractal CMs and another when people just want to kick back, relax and casually get some extra loot in T1, T2 &amp; T3 recs.  
---
* That DH 3-4k below you? Yeah. Him.  He took "Stand your Ground," so you wouldn't be dazed prior to the 50% Gladiator Break. 
---
* That Reaper/Scourge 6-8k below you? Yeah, that "asswipe".  She took boon-corrupt so you wouldn't burst into protection.  /^derp. 
---
* Oh right, she *also* took Flesh Golem to help with the break and saved her CC's so that you could deal better DPS. /^cough. 
---
But yeah, moan about how you're the true alpha-carry as if anyone cares enough to celebrate your accomplishment.  If you want to be an elitist then just make it clear that you don't want Necromancers, thieves or whatever.  The truth is being a class nazi tends to discourage stronger players from helping out which is why people like you silently brood like the emo-edgelords you are. 
---
How shit are you that just having a Reaper extends time by 50%? Reaper DPS is 'low' relative to other choices but not that fucking low bud.
---
On pug Qadim I rather see Reaper in lamp because I don't trust pugs to not fucking die in the lamp and Reaper is really good at the lamp. 
---
Good to hear you looked in a mirror.
---
Actually chronos should be doing some DPS 
---
GW2 Will be forever the best MMORPG out there. You don't even xp when dying, they are so focused in being fun and even more fun. Customisation is awesome, you can customize anything: weapons, armors, mounts, and much more. Share things through characters is another high positive advantage of this game. 
---
I've been charging a gold per blind invite from players like you described. Especially in a situation where you're almost through a JP or something pretty simple that doesn't really take much time to do by yourself.
---
By just sending a PM saying "accept" or something similar, I usually ask them to send one gold in the mail to me. Otherwise, GL with whatever.
---
Friends and guildmates naturally get a taxi if they need it.
---
No gold, not going to accept randoms. Simple.
---
Haven't given a free ride to a random person ever yet. ;-)
---
Too expensive maybe? *Thonk*
---
&gt;  class nazi
---
yeah reapers and thiefs have no place in my cms and they are always smooth.
---
they deal less damage without providing anything useful.
---
i will give you a basic team but 1 dps is wasted for reaper.
---
100&amp;99cm now tell me his job that allows him under 10k dps
---
(actual)pdps, reaper, druid, chrono, bs
---
*     Cantha
---
*     GvG
---
*     Monks, Paladins, Ritualists, Dervish, Assassins
---
*     Dwarves
---
*     The Battle Isles
---
*     The Gods
---
It is not like they developed anything of that, except maybe that canthan district in DR.
---
Unless you expect them to blatantly cut and paste from gw1? 
---
Also what paladins are you referring to? Wamo?
---
The gods are still in the game one way or another, such as Balthazar. But I bet you aren't even playing the game
---
* I’m fed up of this post apocalyptic Tyria
---
The heck are you even talking about, there are so many more prosperous cities and civilization in gw2 compared to gw1, like comparing the dark ages to reinassance
---
Tight, Trahearne did get new dialogue (anf others) but it was mostly in the Claw Island arc not Orr.
---
Don't recall any new music though...
---
Siren's Landing...   
---
Yes I'll be the one: Siren's Reef...
---
I work as a pharmacist so I'm used to reading horrible hand writing from doctors, but this one takes the cake!
---
Still cute though!
---
Thank you for still doing this! People like you keep all of GW2 content alive and fun &lt;3
---
If you are not bursting and not near-instantly breaking bars at speedclear pace, Thief is actually decent. So is Reaper. Good ones of either easily do over 10k dps.
---
I hoped for an achievement where you are shown an alternate ending for the episode. Like a super hidden one. Requires forming a party even. Having at least \*all\* available playable races in the party. Which results to the alternate ending. One can only hope..
---
Not at all what I said 
---
I'd like to remind you that right after HoT release and introducing Teleport to Friend, Anet masterminds were banning people for teleport hacks. Bans were reverted obviously, but that's why I'm wondering how this bug may look in their lackluster logs.
---
10k is a joke in cms
---
&gt; on purpose
---
I’ll be heading there soon - looking forward to it. Thanks for not just biting my head off for having a different opinion. :)
---
There's something about exploration, the environments, and nature in the original game that ArenaNet didn't quite capture with GW2.  I think it mostly stems from GW2 being a theme park MMO whereas I feel Guild Wars is much less of a theme park.  There's a lot more optional exploration in GW1 outside of the story campaigns.  GW2 can feel very achievement or itinerary focused, and it's not necessarily a bad thing, but I don't think it's always the best or most immersive design strategy for their living world maps. 
---
ArenaNet can do very surreal, poignant stories and story-telling via characters, ambient dialogue and conversations.  Yet, when it's compared to the "on the rail" events like Thunderhead Keep meta or the Dredge Oil-Slug meta they feel like after thoughts.  In the sense of, "Yeah, that'd be a nice touch!" I think the PoF dungeon in the Desert Highlands (Rune locked Doors) or the Sanctum of Nabhka in the Crystal Oasis (the Jackal JP) are really cool.  I wish we saw more stuff like that. 
---
first explain me why a necro is allowed to have 10k or less damage at dps report
---
Oh please, you don't have to worry, just asking. No harm telling me your region ☺️
---
This is also true.  Legendaries are a lot less painful if you don't try to rush them, though I've rushed every one of mine because I'm impatient.  
---
Everyone here is telling you to do the story in order and grind all these hours without glidder or mounts.
---
I call bullshit,
---
Get to level 80 anyway you feel and get glidder and mounts asap. Then do whatever people suggested.
---
[removed]
---
Nobody knows that for sure though. We just haven't seen him do it yet. According to this interview he can even already corrupt  https://www.guildmag.com/magazine/issue9/interview.htm
---
I guess in you're in a \[NA\] server, you won't be able to join/play with us. :/
---
*Dragon minions
---
This is the most racistic view I have ever heard someone have in a video games.
---
Tells a lot how you think about people being different than you.
---
Yes, it's the toughness factor. A rather long time ago, magi was the gear standard for druids, since it has healing power as main stat without screwing up raid tanking roles due to toughness. Forget about the offensive stats on druid healing gear, their effect on your damage is negligible.
---
Oh okay so you have no evidence for your claim
---
I am not "bitching". I've played through the episodes, I paid attention, I don't recall anything at all like what you've said here. If you're going to be so rude and arrogant, the least you could do is prove yourself right if you're *so sure* you didn't just make up this little fantasy of how it worked in your head.
---
It may be more 2-3k.  It was more for example's sake. 
---
you might be retarded if you compare racism to a profession in guild wars
---
Oh you know.. The way you "talk" tells me everything, I hoped you would say na... Now my only hope is that you are on my block list....
---
😂 thanks man! Appreciate the perspective.  I'm still leaving towards taking it slowly, but if I get bored ( don't see how) I'll kick it to 80!
---
Necro is a totally legit class just like any other class as well. Your applied racism and narrow minded perspective of the game does make your opinion right.
---
The way you answered obviously shows that you did not even try to help another player out, who might have needed a guiding hand.
---
Do note that the dialogue between Taimi, Kasmeer and Marjory is not here. 
---
I will do that in a seperate little video ;)
---
There is also a rare event with some dialogue that is not here. I Will probably do a seperate video for that aswell.
---
Anyway hope you enjoy :D﻿
---
Around RNG. Yeah, RNG is now a numeric value.
---
Had to prove them otherwise c:
---
they dont need a "guiding hand" if they dare to join my group with this garbage. they are not even sorry if you slow down the group for 4 other players
---
The problem probably is in your hand if your last resort to an argument is to call people retarded without any further evidence.
---
I am done here. You are not improvable... 
---
I wanna block you.
---
so can i get your ign?
---
50 Shades of Scarlet.
---
I agree with you here. They are still forces of nature, their cycles and the fact they are pretty much bulwarks of magic support that. The thing is that what _we_ learned over the years is that the dragons have more to them on top of that. They have "domains" beyond the obvious and Kralkatorrik's is clairvoyance. Since we saw it first in Glint, it makes sense it runs through the 'family' (him, Glint, Aurene) and just makes him a more fleshed out character and the world more fleshed out in general. 
---
Still a norn.
---
i dont want to be improved since i dont look for perfection. 
---
the only thing i want is group where everyone puts the same efford
---
No they do not, I just did a few 'ranked' games and no achievement moved.
---
Rating and pips are locked, pvp is just pvp until the new season.
---
You do not have to be level 80 to get a mount. You need to have someone who is level 80 start the story and essentially carry you through it, but then you can buy a mount at the end of the instance even as a lower level. 
---
Humans didnt event came from tyria :Kappa: So Humans are actually Eldar not Elves

&gt;It's considered just forcing yourself in someone's face
---
This! I've gotten random party invites from strangers while I'm just exploring a map or doing some event. I always appreciate when they at least whisper me first. Otherwise, it's like trying to force people to play with you and sometimes, I just feeling like doing stuff solo.
---
i thought this was going to be the airship gryphon to chest
---
Back outfits technically qualify as weapons, not clothes, so yes.
---
Champion titles do move 
---
honestly the fact that so few people know about this is evidence we should be given /gg 
---
True, it would be awesome for story instances.
---
The top, shoes and boots are all part of the same set, fwiw. But I often end up switching to another pair of boots even though I like these ones.
---
They retconned Balthazar from an honorable warlord who respects bouts in the mists and gave blessings to his followers into this bitter warmonger with no care for his followers or the world. Despite the fact he had heavy Zaishen presence in GW1 and in GW2 you even are wielding a backpack in his honor and blessing by participating in WvW.
---
GW2 is a shell of GW1. I'm actually quite tired of the Breakfast Club style Dragon's Watch and Canach's insufferable quips. Really, this story past LS2 is a pile of quips from one to the next. I like to play high fantasy games, not some Battlestar Galactica fantasy knockoff.
---
Vanilla GW2 started noble and complex but then they replaced the old crew with a bunch of teenagers and made it some family trek. Ironically the best parts of the story is when we don't have the Dragon's Watch garbage and we see Elonians in their struggles with Joko or the sylvari dealing with Mordremoth. As soon as Braham (huge downgrade to Eir, can't stand him), Rox and Taimi come in, I just don't give a rat's ass anymore.
---
I rolled this elegant sylvari to roleplay with the whole Wyld Hunt early story and now I'm some personality free shoe in commander parroting the writers' "clever" quips. It's almost like my character is unable to comport himself within the context of his background and the cataclysmic events surrounding him.
---
Balthazar wasn't retconned at all though? He was "betrayed" and locked away in the mists which led to him getting desperate, deranged and consumed by vengeance, thats not a retcon its a character ark.
---
Salvage the ones that have 2 (or more) infusion slots (attuned, infused, attuned+infused etc) while attuning thes ones that have a single infusion slot so that they're worth salvaging.
---
Ohh hey this happened to me too. 
---
Adds are every 12.5% I think. 
---
You can dps it down quite easily if dps is good or you can go slow and focus the adds.
---
Todays instas were quite hard: A lot of boons for the boss and a lot of condis for the group. Without boonrip on a pug it was quite messy. 
---
They didn't really retcon Balthazar, he just became bitter due to being exiled.
---
He literally says at one point "I no longer see any honor in war." Characters changing in response to traumatic events isn't retconning, it's just how stories work.
---
I know a liar when I see one :)
---
Considering where it's located, I think it's probably some of Gorrik's fap material.
---
Wrong.
---
Trying to figure out the drop rate of those will probably be tricky since they should stop showing up once you have it unlocked unless you also want to assume that all things within a category has equal chances.
---
Open world content up to level 80 is all pretty easy, and then the difficulty spikes up unexpectedly at the first expansion. people start learning that they're actually just awful at the game because they never needed to be good up to that point 
---
Dungeons are a bit more on the difficult side if you want, those start at level 30. If you bring people who know all the mechanics and everything about the dungeon though, those can also mostly just be breezed through.
---
How about this.
---
Instead of Kralk having the domain of time, he has the domain of certainty, which folds in nicely with crystal, because crystals have a well defined structure, they embody a structural order. He is prophetic because his can see the deterministic future. Bubbles, on the other hand is water and unpredictability. So bubbles counteracts the prophecy of Kralk because his domain makes the world non-deterministic.
---
I am also very suspicious about Aurene's vision's. If that is prophecy, then, as been mentioned elsewhere, it isn't very good. I have to insist that prophecy is the vision of a singular outcome and with Kralks power, and Aurene's vision, that was not prophecy. Auren's inheritance of prophecy shouldn't have been like that. Auren's vision seems to be a combination of deterministic and non-deterministic effects on potential futures. But how does Aurene gain access to read non-deterministic influences on the future? Well she has friends, one of them being one of the most chaotic and devastating (to the normal order) forces of the time...
---
OK. So one of my wild speculation is that the commander is somehow blessed by bubbles. That the phrase "Scion and Champion" has a different than expected meaning. It actually means the meeting of the powers of two dragons. Their fates are intertwined because, they need to bring balance between both of the opposing dragons.
---
Dungeons is where new players get wrecked the first time. First dungeon is at lvl 30. After that Heart of Thorns is the next big step. 
---
Yea, I wrote the post late in the morning and forgot to mention the game mode, it is WvW based build, it could also work in PvP, but I don't recommend it there yet, especially because you can't play Pack runes in PvP
---
I read this entire string in asura voices arguing over scientific semantics hahaha
---
Interesting, to me, for the most part as a 1mo old player, there really isn’t a whole lot going into build crafting, because sure squeezing that berserker gear out for a bit more tankiness makes you uh, a bit more tanky, that’s not exactly as complicated as “over a hundred stat combinations” you make it out to be. Just smells a bit like deceiving new players into believing here’s a bit more depth to things than in reality there kinda is in the game, but who knows.
---
Why did you remind me of plant husband death T-T
---
Noted. Next time I want to be upvoted instead of downvoted I’ll bark at people “git gud” and call them garbage like a child. 
---
Theres also a backpiece quest collection from episode 2 that is pretty fun, and one of the events required is this one. 
---
Elementalist is a glass cannon, especially if you don't make good use of your defensive skills in Earth and Water attunement. I suspect you're copying a raid build and going out into the world staying in fire and air, and so you get stomped by everything. Try swapping in some defensive traits and use more Earth skills. 
---
Comparing yourself to a necromancer in open world situations will make any class look bad. They're the most durable and self sufficient of all classes. They provide nearly all the self buffs they need, whereas most other builds rely on allies do reach full potential. 
---
Guild Wars is big on active defense. Dodgerolls, movement, active skills keep you alive, not your armor.
---
It won't pick up for a long time.  Open world is meant to be a casual sandbox for exploration and build experimentation.  Generally speaking, if you know the enemies and their attack patterns well you can even solo champions, but there's a relatively low margin for error given that a lot of attacks will OHKO or chain-stun you if you don't have a stun-break.  The difficulty sharply increases in explorable dungeons, but such dungeons are usually power-creeped to death by HoT/PoF elite specs.  
---
No. We’re standing right at the quest turn in. 
---
No. Standing right at the npc
---
Memories of vanilla Ret paladins, doing literally nothing but auto attacks. 
---
100% second the above comment, but maybe for different reasons.
---
*Feeling* the horizontal progression was imo the best  part of going through things in story order. It's like spending years of your life walking around scared of heights, then to be given the ability to float. For me personally, it would (and in the HoT case did) totally change my outlook on content I've been through before. Same case here with PoF, though I understand why some people dislike exploration without mounts when they're an option.
---
I play RPGs for the progression, and shortcutting that progression both robs myself of entertainment and shortens the lifespan of a game.
---
I'm slowly getting back to it. I think the biggest issue is that I am too lazy to do the story and exploration stuff.
---
I call bs on their call of bs. x'D Consider this: major part of the playerbase played through the story normally and got the glider and mounts as they were introduced, and THAT imo let us appreciate these additions even more. By comparison. Yes the core game without gliding/mounts can feel slow, but as a new player you kinda need that time to look around and discover. I'd choose the "natural", orderly game experience anytime. Just felt like jumping in because the commenter sounded so confident that I needed to counter that opinion. :'&gt;
---
Use doges, blinds, knockbacks, blocks, reflect and what not. Ele has tones of cc.
---
When you have a feature other players don't and you use it, you are also acting as an advertiser. That would be my guess as to why it's done that way. People see the TP icon, go to it, see they can't use it, search what it is about, and become interested in it.
---
mean thanos killed almost everyone to have peace and save everyone, why couldnt kralk be the same, mean he's just as purple
---
Erwin Arselkow still faster: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHE4F_8T1PI
---
nice bull shit
---
I've seen people run the stonehead farm in VB doing the same thing, and it always makes me wonder how much faster that really is
---
Suspicious.
---
But seriously. I won't be surprised if we will visit that map next episode or they are saving it for LS5.
---
I *think* it's a scaled down and recoloured form of that one boss in the story of LS4E2. The Exterminator Golem, I think?
---
I don't know if it's faster but for some people the challenge, or the fun (or both!) is in finding atypical ways to gain experience.
---
[Worth it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ael8p1/its_getting_hot_in_here_achievement/edqdi0o/)
---
Pretty sure it's the same writers across multiple living story teams.
---
However, any yellow snow jokes can be attributed to Dan.
---
Looks fine to me. It's not like the one where you pop your mount, and you're stuck in the ground.
---
 no, if it's not a cut scene it's unskippable. ;(
---
Thinking Emoji
---
You can buy them individually in the story menu or entire seasons in the gem store. While I hate the story and have zero interest in it. There were loads of challenging and fun instances and some great farming maps for ascended stuff.
---
Now I have another account where I played through the game, but what I did when starting over since I've already done it was boost one to get a raptor which is the first mount you get very early on in Path of Fire to use while playing my actual character. 
---
End world hunger with obesity, that's like ending a drought with the biblical flood.
---
Makes sense! Thank you!
---
Does hovering over the number reveal anything?
---
The big change from your necro is that you can now not just facetank everything anymore, but you actually got to move, use your blinds, your cripple/slow skills and kite mobs around/burst them. So knowing where your reflects etc. are will greatly benefit you.
---
haha the debate continues! thank you for sharing!
---
I really think I'm leaning towards NOT boosting. 
---
I just use some air attunement for speed right now - feels plenty fast I guess 😃  
---
I have yet to finish my personal story. And I’ve finished S2-HoT-s3-PoF-s4. And most of the end game content including some legendary weapons and armors! Maybe I’ll get to it one day
---
Tried like 50 keys and didn't get it. I want it badly but I guess I'll just wait till its put up for statuettes &gt;.&gt;
---
Yup - I think so! Thank you for sharing!
---
I already knew I wanted one at max level so I boosted one I was going to anyway. I'm leveling a ranger and quite enjoy it but boosted a Necro because I like Reaper a whole lot.
---
Yeah it's a condition hell... 16 stacks of confusion on my thief for half the fight and this was only on low lvl fractalscale
---
No problem, happy to help. The most important thing is having fun!
---
I don't know what it is because I just had a look at the world map in game and I couldn't see this. So either its a bug on your map or its something you made up because it interested you.
---
YEAH!
---
Removed this but putting it back.
---
The 80 shows up only while on Thunderhead Peaks and switching map to underground. It is there, OP is not lying. Doubtful it's a new map though and more likely just an accidental leftover 80 that someone forgot to remove.
---
Correct! Simply BM anything critical which isn't part of the hivemind. 
---
Can anyone tell me how many times I need to do it? 5, 7 or what? Tried it multiple times (a guildmate too) and we still didn't get it...
---

---
I believe it's not just an illusion, since if so then her physical form would be of no importance. She's a physical embodiment of the tree, and her dying would probably mean the tree dies as well.
---
Well I doubt it will stay like this too long. It is totally overkill in every aspect. When I heal as ele I tell the group to focus on Crowe only and not to get pushed off. I am lucky enough to have 2 skills to remove conditions quite fast from everyone, but the heal output I have to contribute is immense to keep everyone alive.
---
Also it is very hard to focus on the boss if you have to keep looking on the floor if you are not going to be pushed off and even if you manage it you probably get hit by Crowe's cleave that disables your skills.
---
I was extremely hyped for the Zhaitan fight. I was immensly let down by the Zhaitan fight.
---
Do you think buying HoT / PoF will help get me back into it?
---
It's magic! 
---
How can i get ascended gear if i litteraly do not even have the mats (accoubtbound ones) for it. It beats the entire purpose of even trying to do something on a druid.
---
I asked for alternatives and this is exactly the reason why. Everyone expects you to craft asc gear out of nowhere. 
---
Screw both of them for open PvE - I hate weapon summons with a passion, so I only use them when I play organized group content (raids or fractals) as elementalist, because only then should Top/Max DPS be of any concern for you.
---
Playing as tempest (fresh air is the most common) you DON'T need weapon summons. You can use any utility skills you like and in general it shouldn't matter. Maxing out your DPS isn't necessary in open PvE anyway.
---
As for alternatives:
---
\- Popular right now is  Fresh air XX/Warhorn (XX = Scepter/Dagger) with Arcane Shield, Signet of Fire and Glyph of Storms || Warhorn is also replacable with another Dagger or Focus, depending on the direction you want to go in. More dmg? Warhorn is your choice - More survivability? Focus it is - More mobility? Dagger is your friend.
---
Just try stuff out and see what you like. Up until a while ago I played Fresh air Tempest with Dagger/Warhorn and all shouts as utility skills. All the auras give you some nice survivability/utility and you can just spam them whenever available if you want. With that I got through Heart of Thorns, Path of Fire and all Living Story up until now without any bigger problems.
---
Recently I switched to Scepter and changed out the Earth to the Arcane trait line - works just aswell and gives me some variety.
---
It looks like an object with default 0,0 coordinates that was either left in, or misplaced from somewhere else.
---
I expect an updated graphics engine gw1. With a character movement update.. boy was I totally wrong.
---
It would be hilarious if they name it *Endgame*.
---
I was hype over "every class can fulfill any role". I didn't realize that what that initially meant was, "tanking and healing are nonexistent; the only role is berserker gear".
---
Eh, just smack it with a wrench. That usually works.
---
Goes back to **at least** 2 months, but I did care because I thought the incoming LS update would solve the issue. 
---
Rather annoying when you want to pre-stack for a fight.
---
AKA: i cant use conjures but i want to cover it by saying im not a meta sheep, meanwhile keeping all the rest of the stats and traits the same
---
LOL
---
Feel free to elaborate on the math.
---
The "Other Players' Unique Item Sounds" option does includes the sound effects from gathering tools. Thanks again.
---
Thanks for replies guys, i noticed same issue on guardian too, even tho its a heavy armor character and i feel it should have a lot of hp
---
Adds are okay, condis are okay, but... 
---
But spamming every other mechanic on ZERO cooldown and all AT THE SAME TIME is what turns an original potentially fun fight into a migraine inducing shitfest, which you won't enjoy even if you succeed.
---
Wow thx for the detailed post! :D
---
Well I'll be sticking staff primarily though, love the stereotype too much I guess! :D
---
I'll be doing open world content, some dungeons (or fractals as they say it here?) and mayby sometimes for the lulz some group pvp when I feel like it.
---
I'm happy that I don't 'have' to rely on conjured weapons to do well in any of those cases, because just as you, I hate the concept of it.
---
I want to wear a staff and make meteors fall, and not stick a giant flaming sword up into someone's......:D
---
The subsequent LS maps following an expansion will not necessarily count towards the daily gatherer achievement regarding those expac regions.  
---
This is not new, in fact, LS3 only included 1 map that counted for Maguuma jungle  gatherer and that was:
---
Bloodstone Fen
---
The rest were as follows:
---
Lake Doric (Kryta)
---
Sirens Landing (Orr)
---
BFF (Shiverpeaks)
---
Ember Bay (Ring of Fire)
---
Draconis Mons (Ring of Fire)
---
So far, LS4 has not followed the formula of LS3 in that all LS maps prior to ep5 were CD.
---
It just takes a mental note to get used to.
---
I have no idea what you are trying to say. OP already said he doesn't want to have to play story to get The Consul's Tomb PoI as otherwise you have to do both metas and depend on it being one of the rooms accessible in the catacombs for that day just to get the PoI. If you don't get the purple plate and don't want to do the story, it's impossible to get to without map breaking. 
---
&gt;  its not even mentioned on Dulfy, who is usually pretty thorough with this sort of stuff.
---
Well, it takes a few days to find everything, and the latest LS is very recent. I'm doing LS3 episodes for achievements now, and half of her guides has credits thanking others for stuff exactly like this. So send it in please, or comfirm if already commented on the guide.
---
My expectation? That it would turn out as a Gameplaywise sequal to gw1 and not this basically Tera clone.
---
And the president golem from the Kourna meta
---
But these weren't made to fight dragons, they were made to defend the Inquest from Awakened 
---
Different keyboard layout for Germany, maybe?
---
How long does it usually take to receive an activation code? I bought Path of Fire 7 hours ago and still nothing. I did receive an email saying that the order is being processed but without any code.
---
"GW2 is just vapor~~ware~~wave"
---
It seems like you just hate them thematically since you say in the comments here that you want to cast meteors and not hit things with a flaming sword. 
---
If this is the case, you should know it's not like that. You're basically just using them for the big AoE skills on them which are on-theme for elementalist: meteors from the fiery greatsword and lightning storm from the hammer.
---
If it helps, just think of them as a 60-second cooldown lightning storm and 3-minute cooldown meteor shower. 
---
&gt; Neither Zhaitan nor Mordremoth were destructive in any way,shape or form.
---
So... lifting Orr from water depths causing a massive tsunami that flooded coastlines, wiped out cities, and sunk islands is not destructive in any way, shape, for form?
---
Literally tearing the ground apart to allow giant vines to strike down an airfleet, leaving chunks of land suspended in the air by said giant vines, is not destructive in any way shape or form? How about the destruction done to Fort Salma, Prosperity, and Concordia?
---
Those seem pretty damn destructive. And that's not talking about the amount of death and destruction their minions caused.
---
&gt; Those are two different scales of 'activeness'.
---
Not in regards to how the NPCs refer to Elder Dragon activeness. Technically speaking, when an Elder Dragon is "active", that means it's _actively_ sending armies of minions out to assault areas outside their territory. It's not necessarily meaning the Elder Dragon themselves are moving.
---
Though every Elder Dragon does some level of personal activity when they first wake up - all five of them - as that first period is them making their massive army.
---
&gt; Also,them not killing Abaddon might have to do with the fact they simply did not want to,or they had no valid substitute for him yet.
---
Right, and the fact they needed a substitute, means they could not spread his power across the five of them, like the Elder Dragons do.
---
&gt; We have seen Balthazar can absorb ED magic with Omadd s machine. So why exactly couldn't the gods band together,bless one of them at a time and absorb a dragon each? Magic is still magic,be it god or dragon,as was shown when Kralka and Aurene both absorbed Balthazar s magic(which also had Primordus and Jormag,granted).
---
So based on examples such as [this little thing](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Cosmic_Power), the statement that "magic is still magic" is fairly false. Dragon magic, ley line magic, and Mists magic all seem to be fairly different.
---
Dialogue from Kormir also implies that the Six Gods have al imit to how much they can absorb, while the Elder Dragons do not. Balthazar was able to absorb that magic because he was drained of his divinity, thus had none.
---
But above all, simply containing magic doesn't balance The All. Otherwise, the plan to replace the Elder Dragons would have simply been "make more bloodstones!" and there would be zero purpose behind Glint's plan.
---
&gt; Caudecus openly opposed him and left with his branch of the WM,and he even states he had some opposition on the way to the laboratory where you first reveal his true identity,so someone definitely opposed him.
---
Verbally opposed him, but not physically. There was no (major) fighting, and no one confronting "Lazarus" during that time. And you may want to [fact check yourself](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Taimi%27s_Pet_Project#At_Rata_Novus), because there is no comment of Lazarus having to fight someone on his way to Rata Novus.
---
&gt;  He was arrogant(as most gods are,to be fair) and simply gave Tyrians an ultimatum : Follow him in battle or die if they stop him. 
---
You are correct here, in a way. Which is actually countering your argument that Balthazar was fighting for Tyrians and to save Tyria.
---
If he was, there'd be no ultimatum, because there would be no need.
---
But Elonians never had to choice, Balthazar struck first. He didn't give them an option, let alone an ultimatum. They didn't even know the Forged were related to Balthazar at first. Their first description of the Forged is: [The incoming refugees describe an army marauding in the area](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sparking_the_Flame_%28Prologue%29#My_story).
---
&gt; He still didn t agree with Gods leaving manking to solve their own problems,and he disagreed even more when the gods decided to not intervene in the impending wake of the EDs.
---
At no point is it ever implied, let alone stated, that he disagreed with leaving mankind to solve their own problem.
---
Not once.
---
He disagreed with not fighting the Elder Dragons. But this was because he just wanted to fight. To quote Balthazar: "I AM CONFLICT!"
---
&gt; You can't blame the guy for getting angry when the other gods gave Tyria to humans only to bail on them when they were needed most.
---
Except that the other gods actually pushed for humans to make peace with natives of Tyria. Balthazar wanted war. He wanted humans to conquer and dominate Tyria. Because, y'know, "I AM CONFLICT!"
---
&gt; Not all scriptures are gods being beckoned to intervene. Lyssa's scriptures are just tales of her being amongst common folk,but nothing such as aiding them. Hell,the scriptures of Dwayna even say she let a guy die because he wasn't trusting of a stranger.
---
My point wasn't about intervention, it was about caring and being among mortals. Lyssa lived among humans - not just in her scripture, but [in the Orrian History Scrolls](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Orrian_History_Scrolls#The_Six).
---
And you're improperly referencing the [Parable of Dwayna](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Parables_of_the_Gods#A_Parable_of_Dwayna). It's a story about a guy who denied himself praying to Dwayna, not a story about Dwayna abandoning someone. Dwayna was not personally involved with her parable, incidentally (same with Abaddon's). But the Scriptures of Dwayna is about Dwayna stopping a massive war when Doric, before being crowned king, begged for intervention.
---
&gt; If he had given no shits about Tyrians,he wouldn't have stood by them and encouraged them to claim what was theirs without fear. Nor would he have brought the glorious into the mists to have eternal glory after battle.
---
You're taking Balthazar of 48 BE, who arguably did give a shit about Tyrians, and using that to claim Balthazar of ~1120 AE cares.
---
Besides the fact that nearly 1200 years passed between the two timeframes, Balthazar's personality itself drastically changed for unclear reasons. By the time of the gods deciding whether or not to fight the Elder Dragons, Balthazar was no longer the honorable but ruthless god of war established in the parables and scriptures or by the Zaishen and Eternals of GW1.
---
7,000 hours ingame later and still going.....going to say it matched the hype for me
---
Nah. I was asking what he meant by the "seer can't fit inside a mountain" being a revelation, as it didn't make much sense.
---
What he meant was that usually seer-type characters are small, and it's weird that Kralkatorrik is a seer and yet so large. 
---
Was this really a thing? I think it would be more likely for the telehackers  to try and scapegoat the new item for their ban.
---
Plot twist, OP is a dolphin.
---
I'd prefer if they just remove or change "in combat" altogether. The only reason I want a /gg in the open world is because 90% of the time it would be faster than trying to fight the shitty in-combat system where you accidentally doinked a nearby enemy, or you have conditions you can't cleanse, or you're miles away from someone but can't seem to lose aggro. If we could actually get a reliable system to drop out of combat my need to gg in PvE would drop dramatically. 
---
I would love to play basically an invisible healer/buffer. You have basically no dps as you are not attacking but having the ability to never be targeted could be enjoyable as hell for me. You just focus on healing and never have to worry about being attacked hell even cooler if it had traits to avoid attacks while invisible.
---
Yes this would shake wvwvw and pvp to the core but doesn't mean it wouldn't be a cool idea to play around.
---
Usually can't enter wvw if you're dead, don't know about pvp
---
If only they can bring back Old Lion's Arch. To this day one of the best fantasy cities ever (compared only to Novigrad from Witcher). How I miss this place... If they ever make Living season 1 playable again... dreams...
---
Initially it did not match my hype, but it improved drastically over the several years that followed.  
---
As a proud owner of every legendary weapon available on 2 different accounts I can tell you I get the bulk of my clovers in wvw. I also buy all the Hero Points for the gift of maguuma in wvw with proofs / testimonies. I absolutely hated the collection for Nevermore. It was bugged when my wife and I made ours. I am sure they have fixed the events and what not since then but the collections are ridiculous. I also am not a huge fan of the way they went to just buy mithril and elder wood. Typing this you would think I wouldn't make any legendaries at all but I am up to 136 legendaries total on just my account. I wish you the best of luck.
---
Base guardian is okay at roaming, but they do suffer from being kind of slow. 
---
Firebrand is the go-to guardian spec for zergs, but it's a tank/support role.
---
When you say mirage what do you have in mind - power or condi build and why?
---
This is a self0fulfilling prophesy. By revealing this info, you will make it happen in an instant.
---
Conditions are from getting blown off the boat into the water. Don't get blown off and it isn't condition hell at all. 
---
I'm new and I only know of their existence by googling.
---
I can't say that I can or can not use them since I've never used them in the first place, I just don't like the concept of them.
---
And I'm playing this game mainly for fun but still want to be as optimal as possible.
---
If my dps will go through the gutter without those skills then I'd consider using them, but since I don't like them thematically I don't like to use something I don't like that much just because everyone else does if it's just a few percent dps loss.
---
I love concept of mesmer aswell, but since the staff isn't the main weapon for dpsing it ruins the fantasy for me.
---
I remember being naive and completely buying into that manifesto trailer... was highly disappointed when the game came out. Though, I've come to accept it for what it is :)
---
Yeah I noticed that but I felt like you get a lot from adds as well
---
But maybe I just never realized how often I got blown off 
---
Some future mist-related hub world reminiscent of the old Lion's Arch center. &lt;3
---
I also got it yesterday just like you. I was hoping I could sell it at the trading post but nope =(
---
dude dont act like there arent actual trash players that get carried through content
---
There would have to be some serious balancing to look at. But since this is all idea I wouldn't jump to crazy op healer/buffer town with out really having any foundation to go off of.
---
thats a pretty ignorant view on the classes and roles
---
"applied racism" wow youre actually pathetic, fucking applied racism in a video game
---
We don't all read dulfy guides
---
You weren't present at launch, were you? That was literally the meta after they had said any class could perform any role as they were developing the game.
---
it's awesome, but is the head at maximum size? because it looks a little bit weird near Ogden.
---
But still, are there viable Staff builds without summon weapons aswell?
---
Where the dps is equal or not that much lower? 
---
We got so spoiled with the last map, it felt huge and jammed with content, and lore, and quests. So much variation there too, and secrets. This map feels very empty in comparison. Even the weapon collecting feels sub par. 
---
No, just make them all single use, and stackable. Then convert a 20 into a stack of 20, etc.  But a single stack of 250 goes a long ways.
---
I dont think he meant multiboxing
---
Tfw I recognised what anime that theme was from within the first 2 seconds, guess I'm a weeb. Also map breakouts for jps are awesome even if this is a really simple one to do regardless.
---
Here's a hexfoundry puzzle one of mine though sadly this superjump on rabbit is nerfed now. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee2X7wpr32k
---
Technically they're called "exterminator" golems. They're designed not to defend, nor to assault, but to exterminate dangerous escape subjects.
---
Or villages of Olmakhan.
---
Dungeons are separate (older) content than fractals. 
---
The META builds are geared for optimization, but you can make just about anything work if you understand how it synergizes. You won't run into issues of "needing optimized dps" unless the groups you join are asking for it (I'm thinking T4 Fractals, Raids and maybe ranked PvP/Tourneys), and you can find a lot of casual groups (or start your own!) that just want to enjoy it and not necessarily clear content as quickly as possible. 
---
TLDR: are these builds just for hardcore min-maxers? Yes.
---
Mirage is well suited for condi, basically all the skills pump massive amounts of long lasting condi into opponents, and the mobility of the mirage lets you keep up the condi spam. Read some guides on it, I’m sure they explain it better than me. In my experience, condi mirage is the only build that can solo all Open world PvE content including legendary bosses.
---
For both gamemodes in order to access legendary armor you're also spending tickets on skins (which unlock the upgraded skins). These are shared time gates. If you want any skins from either WvW or PvP you should plan those. Mixing sets doesn't really matter, except for your first PvE set. 
---
As someone in NA and that needs the event for my backpack collection (and another) I'm super sad you are EU. Beimg in so many failed attempts is soul crushing..... I read your posts before and didn't fuy understand the extension of that until I had to do it myself. 
---
Obtain the [Light of Deldrimor Plate](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Light_of_Deldrimor_Plate) by complete the [Thunderhead Keep Meta](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Thunderhead_Keep_(meta_event)) event for the top half of the plate and the [Oil Floes Meta](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Oil_Floes) for the bottom half of the plate.
---
Trade your pate to [Frodak](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Frodak_Steelstar) for a random color plate and 30 minutes of the [Light of Deldrimore effect](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Light_of_Deldrimor_(Thunderhead_Peaks)), which lets you find hidden chests behind the door.
---
Once behind a door, you should also find a different color plate for another room location.  I believe the purple room is the only one that does not hold a plate.
---
What is /gg? The same could apply to that abbreviation, do people know that more than /stuck?
---
Take him into the first dungeon, ascalon catacombs, that unlocks at level 30. He might be complaining its too hard.
---
The mace deed #3 appeared to be bugged for me as it showed no progression until it finally popped. I was certain I had killed more than 60 by the time it did as I had done several metas. The description said "wielding a mace and shield" but did not specify if it had to be the exotic dragonsblood mace. I am certain I got the first two achieves using The Moot but when I saw no apparent progress on deed #3 I switched to the dragonsblood mace and it popped. I guess my question to Anet is: Can we use any mace/weapon or does it specifically have to be the dragonsblood mace/weapon to complete the deed? If it is so the description needs to be changed to reflect that. Also progression would be nice so folk wouldn't assume the achieve was bugged.
---
There are a couple of examples, but usually it's something like a small team who spins off an old version (runescape classic, for example, or some of the WoW stuff has done it).
---
It's definitely not the norm tho, because people *say* they want it, but then get bored once it's something they've already done.
---
don't let the guys over at /r/trebuchetmemes know
---
I'd like to gg in pve too.
---
Alright so here is my condi mirrage. I can tell you I beat nearly everyone I come across.
---
Traits: https://i.imgur.com/Mo3g5gA.jpg
---
For the Chaos line: 
---
* [Master of Manipulations](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Master_of_Manipulation) super good for Blink and Arcane Thievery recharge + mirror for reflecting all those pew pew.
---
* [Chaotic Dampening](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chaotic_Dampening) for the staff recharge and protection.
---
* [Bountiful Disillusionment](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bountiful_Disillusionment) amazing for securing those stomps, use the F2 a lot to get that 150 condi damage from Vigor
---
For the Dueling Line:
---
* Decoy or I use [Phantasmal Fury](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Phantasmal_Fury). The fury is meh but I always get revealed by the stealth from Decoy
---
* [Evasive Mirror](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Evasive_Mirror) again, more reflect is great. Lots of Longbow rangers out there, deadeyes
---
* [Deceptive Evasion] is the choice for that clone production. Always be dodging
---
For the Mirage Line: 
---
* [Renewing Oasis](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Renewing_Oasis) love that lowered condi duration time. 
---
* [Mirage Mantle](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mirage_Mantle) protection is always good I guess
---
* [Infitite Horizon](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Infinite_Horizon) **THIS** is the trait, everytime you do your Ambush skill, your clones do it too. This is the main source of your damage. 
---
I use **Staff** and **Sceptor**/Torch. Some people use Axe torch but I love the Sceptor 2 block and the Sceptor 3 beam does a like 3-4k damage + the confusion&gt;
---
**Staff Ambush** [Chaos Vortex](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chaos_Vortex)  skill is a MAIN source of damage. You + 3 clones doing this sends purple balls of damage to your opponent.  You get like 12 stacks of bleeding torment and some confusion in there while you dance around your target
---
Utilities: https://i.imgur.com/ZDruxyq.jpg
---
* [Illusionary Ambush](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Illusionary_Ambush) This is skill is amazing. Take you + 3 clones and randomly put you around your target breaking their target WHILE giving you access to your ambush skills.
---
* Blink - obviously has its advantage
---
* [Arcane Thievery](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Arcane_Thievery) I have to have this one. Low cool down, send 3 condis, steal 3 boons, 4 sec of quickness **AND** 2 seconds of mirror.  unblockable at 1200 range!
---
Mmm boon stealing. send that reaper's chill back to them.
---
and of Jaunt is nice, it can get you up to some ledges as a smol blink, 1 condi clear and some condi dmg.
---
**Stats**: 
---

**Runes of Tormenting**

WvW Malign Infusions. Energy sigils on both torch and staff. The rest is up to you. Cleansing, bursting tormenting sigils work.
---
**Playstyle** 
---
It is so cancerous (be prepared for salty PMs) because get 3 clones, dodge and use your [Chaos Vortex](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chaos_Vortex) so you and your clones shoot out 4 chaos vortex orbs.
---
Dodge again and do the same thing
---
Then use Illusionary ambush and do the same thing while removing their target on you.
---
The bleeds and torment stack up so fast. Just dance around and use your ambush skills like [Chaos Vortex](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chaos_Vortex).
---
This game didn't turn out the way I expected it to. I expected something more immersive...in the sense of a single thread story, more like Guild Wars 1. In Guild Wars 1 everything basically supported the story, because the zones were instanced. 
---
In some ways the game exceeded by expectations and in some ways it didn't quite match them. I think the story has generally gotten better over the years (at least the way it's told).  I didn't really love the talking heads cut scenes that the game launched with for example.
---
A lot of the decisions along the way have made the game more alt friendly.  Account bound dyes and the wardrobe helped make this game what it is now, which are good things. Jumping puzzles were off my radar almost completely and I love them. Those things surprised me.
---
I quickly adapted my expectations to what the game was and I haven't looked back. I really enjoy it. 
---
For me the biggest thing this game has, is what it doesn't have...a quest hub system. I like the freedom of wandering.  Just sort of flowing from one thing to another with no plan. I love how I can take my 80 back and help friends without making a new character. And I love the design decisions that made PvE a cooperative endeavor, unlike PvE in a lot of MMOs.
---
I'd always wanted an MMO focused more on the open world than instances, and that's what I ended up getting...in not quite the way I thought it would work.
---
You could learn that crafting level on that character... But it's a pain.
---
On your part.
---
That was exactly the state of the game for years after release, build build diversity was pretty much nonexistent until Heart of Thorns.
---
Yeah it's a rather weird decision
---
Saying pranking a DYING AVATAR OF THE PALE TREE doesn't have as nice of a ring to it.
---
When did you start playing?
---
Having open world event chains was a big deal back then. Not sure if GW2 was the first to do this but it seemed unique at the time.
---
Blue and greens clog up your inventory. This just cuts that right back without having to keep buying salvage kits. It's *entirely* a convenience thing but it's a reasonable one if you do any zerg events. 
---
Rares and exotics I use masters kits for. Might not be the best decision financially, but it's hassle-removal that just makes play less stop-start. 
---
Ah I see. Thx for the advice 
---
yes it was and I remember dornsinger apologizing for this on reddit but I can't bother looking for it 3 years in the past
---
I had seen a map that showed the size of each elder dragon by the map of tyria. And Kralkatoric is HUGE. 
---
But what we see in the latest episode...he isn't THHAAATTT huge. At least it doesn't feel like he is.
---
i mostly blame stealth as a mechanic for that
---
dunno how much targeting matters in pve as most if not all targets requiring healers spam aoe as their default desing
---
Don't worry, it's fine. He skips leg day.
---
RIFT was the first MMO I played with this feature, although it was slightly different. 
---
/gg kills your player.  Anyone who does fractals or raids knows that command as it is used when an attempted kill has reached a point that players are not dead but they will not succeed.  It is very well known, not just because of that, but also because anet made an announcement when they implemented it in game.  Additionally you can use /resign /surrender /consede /forfeit /ff /qq, they are all the same as /gg.  
---
I get into MMOs with lanch of SWTOR, which while nice, was way too generic MMO - I hate raids time (cause of my shift work), holy trinity and gear treadmill. And then, while liking scifi more then fantasy, I hear about GW2, watch trailers and get hyped.... But even if anyone tell me that 6 years later I will invest almoust 10 000 hours of my time into one single game..into one single anything really... I wouldnt belive.
---
Thankfully I am not as many people around (you can read about that in comments around and in your thread too), as I dont expect anything from anet. I play game, I dont expect them to give us anything "because we want it" or "we deserve it". I dont expect story to be bad or good or that its not go in way people dream of. I play story, world and game which someone else created for me... and I am happy ..and achiv hunting :) 
---
Well , if youd like thief, you have dp and sd builds, which are not cheesy. Sd is one of most fun builds accross the game, and still very strong in roaming.
---
If you stay tuned here. You'll see that more [NA] commanders lead this than in [EU]. The problem here is that they only lead sometimes or from time to time. We had the same issue in [EU]. That's why i jumped in. An "every week-end" lead is always better. If you're not available for a one-time tour it's kind of sad. Now, europeans adventurers know that they can miss a party, they will for sure find another one the day after.
---
I wish [NA] organize the same way soon.
---
They are starting to look like cut asura gate / semicircle golem, next step golems that work as an asura gate, pocket teleportation, no fees! Summon golem and port! viola!

---
yea i'm pretty disappointed with the last couple of fractals. while i understand it can be difficult to create a fractal with different stages of difficulty, i hate this way of "we need to make this fractal harder. let's add more enemies! oh and more AoEs of course" that Anet is going recently.
---
it's been like that since twilight oasis, and i honestly hope ANet finds a way to create fractals like nightmare and shattered observatory again.
---
I was obsessed before launch. I grinded my way through 50/50 Hall of Monuments &amp; the Champion of the Gods title, and signed up and made sure to be available for every beta. I was in many of them, and excited about every one. However, starting just before launch and continuing thereafter, the game's direction took a sharp turn: existing rewards decreased; masses of new currencies, trash, unique trinkets and "collectibles" were added, inflating the economy and wasting player bag space; and cash shop items became more frequent and offered more tangible advances in the game in exchange for real world money. "Balance" updates introduced regularly since then, rife with unaddressed bugs, often have predicted but dramatic effects on the economy by suddenly invalidating the core ethos of an entire specialization which Anet themselves previously described in exceptionally delicate prose. This happens regularly, and alienates the players most familiar with and loyal to their game. Gradually, anet have introduced more practices that, strangely, cater to players who don't even play this, the 5-year-old second game in an RPG franchise, that much. They're the crappy chain restaurant advertising trendy new appetizers to tourists when it should be figuring out its main course. It's like a bunch of people explicitly wanted GW2 to fail critically. It's a shame that it has no mission anymore, but it truly is very pretty.
---
Hes a giant crystal ball. So why not.
---
Indeed, but why settle for just the head? They could make his entire body the zone. Like, maybe consuming all of that Mists energy made him so large that he could no longer fly/move? Or he finds a magic gold mine and no longer sees a reason to vacate, with all that juicy magic to consume?
---
The possibilities are endless. I need this.
---
Few questions, since anet updated the policy about multiboxing.
---
If I take 2 of my accounts to a meta event, and get participation with one of them -hit boss a few times for eg- and then afk and swap to the other account. Is that against any rule?
---
2, how taxing it is on the pc to open 2 clients? Any noticeable fps drops?
---
there are 4 cannons. 
---
You put one person on each cannon and keep the mobs away.
---
What!? Where!? I missed it!? Link!!? or tell me what was said please! 
---
Coming from gw1, gw2 was a punch in the gut initially, the way everything went all over the place in so many aspects was...disheartening, it's only after a few years and up until now that the game kinda aged well but I had already lost interest and didnt get to experience its good times 
---
Introduce him to jumping puzzles, show him the Nebo Terrace defense event, take him to a leyline anomaly, do bounties, those oughta pose some challenge to scratch his itch until the lvl 80 stuff.
---
1. Question -&gt; https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/af78lz/weekly_rguildwars2_question_thread_january_12_2019/
---
2. Yes and no. You can buy gold with money and you can use this money to craft the best equipment. But this best equipment is the same for 6 years, so yeah... Everyone gets equal chances to get good equipment
---
3. Necro is a very braindead class. Easy choise for a beginner
---
4. Crafting is nessesary to obain the best gear, it's a nice kickstart for leveling your toon but not very consisten in the long run
---
5. None. All races live in peace with other, The enemy are NPCs and player from other servers
---
6. Warrior is another easy to go class
---
Dude, more of the community really needs to know about your presence. Think kind of thing takes patience to make. I love your videos on YouTube, and subscribed as soon as I watched one. Keep up the good work!
---
Dude don't act like recommended fractals are on the same level as raids or 99/100 CM
---
&gt; Like, maybe consuming all of that Mists energy made him so large that he could no longer fly/move? 
---
He's already supposed to be the size of a large mountain. No need to make him even bigger. Pinning him down is a good idea though.
---
Zhaitan didn't get this treatment either. You face him in an instance. With their statements about moving forward without expansion drops like HoT or PoF, I think it will probably become customary that we don't see big mega events like that since the community whined to high heaven about the map-wide metas like Dragon Stand. And although I enjoy DS, I don't see ArenaNet making content like that anymore.
---
I remember this. I was still in high school back then.
---
I had been playing GW1 for a number of years and was super hyped about it. I really love GW2 but it was different than I had expected! Not in a bad way. GW1 was more hardcore/teamplay/instanced based. GW2, when it was released, was more casual/soloable/open world and didn't have the hardcore endgame that GW1 had. I think the release of raids cleared that gap for me :)
---
My personal experience with the actual release and playing for the first time was a major disappointment. In fact, I hated it. I remember being totally disappointed with the personal story and character development. One thing I did like was the combat mechanics. I also thought the game was beautiful. 
---
I quit playing for a little over a year and was really upset about leaving the franchise initially because gw1 was my shit. 
---
I came back and tried to get into the story and PvE again but it’s just so bad compared to gw1. I got into WvW and have been there since. Ofc WvW is a shitshow now but thankfully Anet have been doing a lot better with PvE content the last couple years. 
---
One thing I was furious about was Anet’s decision to (for the most part) axe Cantha and the lore associated with that part of the game because someone was apparently offended at NCsoft. 
---
Overall, the combat mechanics were, and are great fun but this game doesn’t compare at all to the greatness of gw1 in my opinion. 
---
Because then he wouldn't be able to escape for the story to go further.
---
&gt; the game is not pay to win, right?
---
most people would say no, its not pay to win. top teir equipment isn't very hard to get and there's no grindy luck-based enchanting to get a +20 weapon or something. there are exclusive gemstore-only skins though. its possible to convert in-game gold to gems to spend in the gemstore. 
---
however elite specialisations are locked behind buying the game/expansions. i don't consider buying a game to be 'p2w' but some people do so idk
---
&gt; i picked human necromancer, is it too hard to play or its fine? im planning to complete quests only and explore the maps
---
completing quests and exploring maps can be done with any character in any race. dont worry about builds, you'll have enough skill points (hero points) to learn them all before you hit max level. you can also change your build anytime
---
&gt; how is the crafting in that game? The professions also, im interested in professions that you have to harvest certain things or craft different things.
---
its alright, youll need a lot of mats for all crafting so go run around and harvest
---
&gt; which race is the enemy? as i understand every race starts at a different location so its like free for all? or its like 2 races together vs 2 races ( like alliance vs horde for example ).
---
theres no open world pvp in pve maps
---
Upvote. I need this. 
---
Okay, who unleashed their Fractal Console into the open world again? : P
---
The Consul’s tomb, while should be 100% accessible outside of SM is STILL ACCESSIBLE. People always cry when they cannot or will not think outside of the box. 
---
When you cannot figure something out don’t cry on a forum when there are OBVIOUS ways around an issue.
---
You’re doing it wrong it a valid statement.
---
I and people can’t always walk people hand in hand through content in replies. 
---
Figure it out.
---
It is really not difficult.
---
When I couldn’t get the rats tail in FF Original I nutted up and figured it out. 
---
Nestor wasn’t a forum cry away for me.
---
A quick ask in map chat would get this PoI done faster than a qq post on reddit.
---
You’re doing it wrong.
---
I stand by my statement
---
If you do world completion without mounts the first time.  Then 2nd time around you do it with mounts.. You really appreciate them more.  Like holy shit the difference.
---
It seems show up on other maps, too, mostly upper level and underground, depths and underground from the Mistlock Sanctuary.
---
Youll be fine. Ele is great, dps is the best way for survival in this game anyway unless youre necro. 
---
Its just a harder class to start with but its not bad. Read your abilities, mind your cooldowns and try to remeber them roughly since you swap elements and dont see them. 
---
I started with engi 6 years ago and its a bit of the same with the kits. It made me love the combat. 
---
I hate engi now though, holo's fine I guess, 
---
What the fuck?
---
&gt; the game would usually of kicked your ass a couple times by now.
---
By level 12??  How terrible at games are you guys?  This isn't Dark Souls here...
---
&gt; You don't just face him 
---
You literally stab his eye.
---
1) not really, (mostly convenience items and fashion but fashion is the end game so)
---
2) necro isn't hard, it's actually among the easier ones IMO (race has very little effect on your character besides looks)
---
3) crafting is alright, it's a good way to level up and get gear. you don't need a "profession" in order to harvest things, just the right tools (a pickaxe, a lumber axe and a harvesting sickle)
---
4) there's no different player factions. it's all the players VS elder dragons (NPC exclusive faction) so no other player is a danger to you (except psychologically in rare cases)
---
5) try what looks interesting. also don't stick to humans, explore the other races a bit
---
if you've got experience with MMOs i'll have to warn you that gw2 does things it's own way so don't rely too much on past experience. 
---
don't try to rush things by grinding mobs, explore n shit.

---
&gt; You linking that item also contraddicts your own statement that Exalted were linked to god magic and thus incorruptible,since they are put in a separate category(Ley magic) compared to Foefire,which as you stated also had to do with god magic. So are you now saying different god magic types exist as well?And should we take a collection item as solid canon?
---
Foefire is listed as magic from the Mists which... fits, given the gods... came from the Mists. Just like the Jade Wind being powered by a blessing from Dwayna that got twisted by Shiro.
---
The Exalted being placed in ley line magic, I'll admit, is a weird choice there. But it's actually [directly confirmed](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Exalted_Bastion) that Exalted are incorruptible - that's why they're given the role they were. What is suggested is their ties to the gods, as their magic came from the Forgotten, who like humans ans the gods, came from beyond the Mists, and the Forgotten were also long-standing devout followers of the gods. It's unclear if the Forgottne used the same type of magic, but their magic is 100% confirmed incorruptible to dragons, and it is tied to the Mists.
---
Now if we had confirmation the Jade Wind was incorruptible to dragons...
---
&gt; If Balthazar wasn't at least partially fighting for Tyria,he could have just rickrolled his army to every major city and built up an army of forged
---
And how, pray tell, would he physically manage to do this?
---
And why, pray tell, would he waste time sending his army away from his objective, when there were unwilling converts along the way.
---
Plus, whole issue of expansion location limitations...
---
&gt; since it would have been much more proficuous than going against an ED with just the spirits of the mists.
---
He never did. The Forged began with his Eternals, but quickly grew with Elonians slain and forced to function as Forged. It's why he had Joko take him to the Domain of the Lost, so that he could take the souls of those killed traumatically, then he ordered his army to kill people traumatically, so that he could access their souls.
---
&gt; The parable of Dwayna cites that he did not pray to her because he knew what he had done wrong. But Dwayna punished him for not trusting a stranger,and that s,bluntly put,being a b****.
---
Uh, no it doesn't. Go ahead and read it. I linked it. Dwayna is not involved in the story, and the only time she is ever mentioned or reference is "He did not call to Dwayna for help as he knew he didn't deserve it. For him, the morning never came." which is the ending.
---
She didn't go to him, but she was never called either. She did not punish him; she did not make that story, she did not fell the tree that landed on him. She was not involved.
---
&gt; The only reason Balthazar changed was exactly because of what the gods did. They all retreated away from Tyria,but could still practice their roles and influences,whilst Balthazar couldn't,being directly tied to battle and courage. He was opposed by all of them when he opted to go fight EDs,which as you said was to add them to his own power,but i don t believe it to be solely for that,at least initially. He got struck down by his own brethren for being brave. Hotheaded,yea. Impatient?Sure. But he initially wanted to go help Tyrians,even if for his own ends. And he got beaten,de-godified(not sure what the term is) and locked up for it.
---
Again, false. Balthazar's personality in Kormir's flashbacks is nothing like his presentation in GW1. His change happened before that discussion. No follower of his, no scripture of his, no anything relating to Balthazar ever depicted him as a battle-hungry "I AM CONFLICT" manchild.
---
His personality got twisted by the writers so that he could be turned into a villain. He did not turn into a villain because of the gods' (in)actions, he was turned into a villain to make him disagree with the gods actions.
---
And this is as clear as [being struck in the face with a fish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhJQp-q1Y1s) if you play through Facing the Truth.
---
Some people who want to try to create narrative consistency into the game have theorized that, given the hints that Menzies died between GW1 and Balthazar's outrage, that maybe Balthazar ate Menzies soul and that changed Balthazar's personality, explaining his very devious and underhanded tactics in Season 3 that made people think Menzies was pretending to be Balthazar.
---
&gt; That s when he saw there s no honor in war,but it still doesn't strike me as having completely given up on Tyria.
---
In the very same discussion he mentions no honor in war, he states that Tyria is a "trivial concern" when the Commander tells him that Balthazar's actions will destroy the world.
---
Balthazar didn't care about Tyria.
---
I liked it. I enjoyed it. But I did not have an emotional reaction to aurene like most others seem to have had. And I think it was a little short. What felt longest was in the last part I got stuck in a crystal cluster and had to relog and redo that part of the story ): lol
---
I Nuremberg watching this dozens of time... A true work of art!
---
&gt;With their statements about moving forward without expansion drops like HoT or PoF, 
---
Did I miss something? I can't find anything about this online, I know we're going straight to season 5 after 4, but are no more expansions coming at all?
---
Operation Brand the Borderlands.
---
wtf kinda hacks are that
---
Hopefully they fix it! I thought I was going crazy because I couldn't get any other color to drop :( and it doesn't help that the Light expires after 30 minutes lol. 
---
I remember when GW2 was announced in PC Gamer back in 2007. Rushed to the book store to pick up the magazine for the Asura mini pet in GW1. I expected it was just going to be a bigger, better version of GW1. In some ways it delivered, in other ways it didn't.
---
I wait for the previous meta fail... Hum sorry, end. Then i light up my cat tag. Usualy, 8:00pm utc, my lfg is on. Yes i'll do both saturday and sunday every week.
---
But any class can fulfill any role. The thing is if you're not a scrub you don't need 'any roles,' you need berserker elementalists and warriors. and mesmers for skips.
---
I'm meaning in a first time playthrough it was possible to get killed by level 12. which is getting your ass kicked compared to guild wars 2 fam. I'm starting to remember why I ditched this game for ESO.
---
I am about 70% sure that's actually part of the purpose of the Inquest Mark III golems:  
---
[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/d/d6/Mark\_III\_Suppressor\_Golem.jpg](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/d/d6/Mark_III_Suppressor_Golem.jpg)
---
In the whole scheme of things, what Jessica Price did wasn't that crazy. And we DO know it was the controversy, because Fries was sacked too, and we know damn well they almost certainly weren't considering firing him before that.
---
Anyways, the precedent IS that if you work for a company that has invested money in training and hiring you, being rude on social media towards anyone on your own time will never result in an instant sacking. 
---
Perhaps an investigation with HR, and some kind of sanction, at most. But generally, when you're on your own time, you get to be whoever you want.
---
She isn't a hotel receptionist. A hotel receptionist is actively working for a company doing their duty. JP wasn't being rude to her customer. She was being rude to a layman.
---
Again, it was the culture war that was invoked that got her fired, and nothing else. Because if it were anything else she would not. Also, there wouldn't be an overblown reaction.
---
Great, will watch out around that time then
---
DEPENDS
---
nope its not 
---
It's funny how every single race capital ended up looking differently. Except for DR, after all generic fantasy cities are like whites for an Asian, all the same XD
---
It was almost certainly this even alone, as she apparently put in a lot of work there before, being sacked. It's also almost certainly the case because they sacked Peter Fries as well, and there's no way this would have been a catalyst for him. Clearly ANet sacked two employees over a culture war.
---
i don't think it was rushed and more that the middle was just fluff you breeze through without thinking about it too much. everything this episode got overshadowed by the end.
---
it isn't perfect but it's definitely among the better episodes we've had
---
Hm. the wiki notes that events are also caped at 10 levels above the player level.
---
Not being as survivable is somewhat the point of the whole endavour - and its quite possible to survive exteme situations. I've had a blast with some friends walking with lvl 2 alts to TD and Arah. It's possible to get there but you must not be hit once.
---
While I would not recommend such an extreme case for a new player needing to use active mitigation teaches the game much better and is also more engaging than sticking to the level appropriate areas.
---
This episode is a cartoon. It's nice to watch, but mechanically is a snoozefest. It's about difficulty but about gameplay. It offers nothing but visuals and probably some emotional breakdown for oversensitive people.
---
If I wanted to watch cartoon, I'd watch a cartoon. I expect more active entertainment from a game.
---
Pve point of view, I guess.
---
I want to fight on Kralk. 
---
His back was mistaken for a mountain right? So fighting on him would justify being a zone.
---
I was thinking the same thing; DS and the Mouth of Mordremoth fight specifically are by far my favourite open world content in the game - I fully expected them to do something similar for Kralkatorrik in the future, but while watching the latest Guild Chat, I got the impression that even this fight was extremely hard to make and that they ran into quite a few problems with it, so it has shaken my hopes up a bit. I really do wish they would go through with something like this, seeing as the Mouth of Mordremoth fight is already amazing to me and that's without that cut 2nd phase they mentioned/showed once before.
---
&gt; You don't move like you do with Tequatl
---
Instead of taking a jump pad you fly. 
---
Your points are really weak.
---
But you already spent 50 keys. What's another 50
---
/stuck
---
I think it was more of a logistical problem with this part if the story. I would imagine most of their energy went into the one big fight at the end which left other areas feel lacking. Also considering that episode 4 had the suns refuge to build up made it feel like there was a lot more reliability to the map.
---
No way we are getting all 3 at once. 
---
Don't make me. Laugh. 
---
That's so awesome, great job :D
---
There's no difference between being annoyed by something and thus commenting on it, and being annoyed by something and venting about it, since venting about something is a comment.
---
Since you've already stated that getting annoyed is a normal reaction, and since you're implying that commenting is a normal thing... commenting about something that annoys you is thus a normal thing and you complaining that someone is doing just that is rather silly of you.
---
Oh, and before you try (again) to define venting as something you do when frustrated... don't.
---
Well shit I didn’t know what that’d do in an instance rip me
---
Thanks lol
---
You're welcome. ;)
---
But not over hyped
---
Oh that’s right. Haven’t gotten around to finishing the final tier of the inquest back piece yet but I understand the frustration.
---
Actually, in regards to Divinities reach, they had to cut some of the more unique asian flavor of the cantha district as they didn't want to offend the Chinese market. 
---
Saw this live at gamescom and got goosebumps. (the insanely loud speakers helped with that...) 
---
lol,I heard some ppl saying that the story gets better the more u advance into the seasons, but damm, now u guys got me super hyped.  Maybe this reaction is just cuz i never saw an mmo putting any effort into story content, i mean there is eso but idk the closest thing to this feeling in eso, was the orsinium storyline.
---
Guilty.
---
What s weird is we see Forgotten Priests being Branded,but i would imagine their magic would also protect themselves.
---
How phisically? No one in Tyria is stronger than us,and we got rickrolled by Balthazar. It wouldn t be hard for him to storm DR with his Lazarus shtick,sending both WM and Forged in to slay/submit fighters to his cause,since his entire point was to go fight all EDs,not just Kralkatorrik.
---
Last i checked,Storms are related to Dwayna. Its clear as clear can be it is a metaphor,just like Lyssa dressing up as a little kid or old woman is.
---
You are right in saying Balthazar wasn't this. He became this. And altho it is a pretty drastic turn,what happened to him along with the confinement is pretty reasonable to have changed him and his views. I have no idea about the menzies theory thingy,IIRC we don't even know who won the fight between the 2.
---
Yes,trivial to the task of taking down the EDs. Which...yes,it is Trivial. Tyria is damned either way,since we aren t gonna be finding Scions for Primordus and Jormag anytime soon when they wake up again. I m with Balthazar on this one,might as well try absorbing one himself. Can't go anymore wrong than it went in All Or Nothing.

source for that allegation of the lore being cut?
---
They cut the asian district out of DR because they felt it was reflecting the english imperial rule encompassing that culture if I recall. Cantha and the rest still exist. Hell, Shiro of the revenant thing even mention it. 
---
I heard about it at release not knowing it a was a mmo. Friend on xbox who played 1 was talking to another who played 1 and was like 'Ive been playing all day and Im still in the start zone!' 
---
Was the first game I got when I built my PC they next year. And though I got burned out by raids, still it my most played game.
---
im watching it right now, just made a brake to check stuff. But yeah this needs to gets more love, its the closest thing to playing s1 now
---
That's for sure! I have another one ready to be posted (even if it ain't as cool as this one)  
---
I just don't want to spam too much in this reddit, so I'm waiting for the right time to post it.  
---
Is the spoiler window already over?  Because if not, revealing that we do not successfully kill Kralkatorik should definitely count.
---
Biggest letdown of my gaming career 
---
&gt; You don't just face him like you do with the Destroyer. 
---
Did you mean Primordus? The guy who just sits in lava and doesn't even have his body modeled?
---
A character arc that was just dropped on us completely out of character. Suddenly we are to believe he of all the gods and not Grenth would lead a rebellion against the others and then be sent to prison.
---
It's as if you found out out of the blue that Taimi had gone full Scarlett and Dragon's Watch had imprisoned her and now she's gone full Inquest on the world.
---
You have 5 character slots now. You can split the game into it's two parts: pre-80 and 80. Keep your original character at current level and continue to do the story and world completion with that character. Create a new character, boost that one to 80, you'll instantly get exotic gear, and take this new character to get the mounts in path of fire, glider skills in heart of thorns, and then you can do silverwastes to start making money. In order to get mounts and glider skills, you have to level up xp... so basically you'll be playing the game and having fun in two different kinds of settings.
---
Just tell him to go play in higher level zones. A newbie at lvl 12 is almost certain to still be in the starter zone, and it doesn't get easier than those.
---
It's the razer naga with the 12 buttons on the side, wheel in the middle, two programmable buttons under that. Mine came with addons that had fewer buttons as well, but I don't use them. I got it from Best Buy but I'm sure they have some kind of model as well.
---
With the freedom of dual classes in GW1 with the announcement of fluid class roles in GW2, the possibilities were endless. Logging into the beta and realizing that I was locked to skills based on my weapon, and had a limited pool of utility skills crushed me. 
---
I was a Monk main in GW1. Played it almost exclusively. Several thousand of hours later in GW2 and I still haven't found a class that is my own. None of them have interested me enough to stick with them. Druid healing was close for me, but I couldn't solo content with a massive struggle (no henchies). 
---
"Farming" in the sense of what it was in GW1 isn't a thing in GW2. The thrill of finding a new build to solo or duo content isn't in GW2. I had hundreds of hours of brainstorming new ideas for builds to overcome challenges for high rewards. The most lucrative farms have always just been massive tagging events that I can do while watching Netflix in another tab. The best looking gear can be bought with real money. Instead of farming, it would be more efficient for me to get a 2nd job at minimum wage and buy gems with it. 
---
PvP was a chess match that provided a unique playground for spectacular builds. Dervish enchantment tanking, Paragon speed boosts, Touch Rangers, etc; all of these were developed by the community through brainstorming. There's just nothing like it that in GW2. 
---
The only thing that remained was a stellar story. I played most of the content once, and didn't go back.
---
In summary, the things I loved in GW1 were all removed in GW2. The creativity that I was expecting to be expanded upon was removed. The chess matches of competitive PvP were replaced with strict metas with overpowered classes. I have been lost trying to find a class to find my own. The reward for creativity is gone. 
---
Escape / change character menu / get in again with the same character.
---
Assuming you aren’t raiding, the fastest way I’ve found is to do the heart around the forge cheering on the NPCs. You can do it from your mount. I recommend buying the map portal scroll and bring all your alts there to do the heart daily.
---
Thread removed: Spoiler(s) are not allowed in titles, feel free to re-post this without the spoiler in the title.
---
In all honesty, I haven’t enjoyed season 4 the same way I enjoyed Path of Fire.  
---
I feel like each major moment of season 4 has been about the major characters reacting to a plot twist.  When the major characters come up with a solution to the plot twist, another plot twist happens.  To me personally, it feels like season 4 has overused plot twists as a mechanism to drive the story.  Call me old school but I prefer a story to be driven by antagonists/protagonists.  
---
In terms of gameplay, I’ve really liked the open world areas they’ve added in season 4, particularly Sandswept Isle.  My only complaint is that there was a few story mode boss fights that I didn’t enjoy enjoyable due to the overuse of knockdown/AoE mechanics.  The trick to a good boss fight is often a “less is more” approach.  Have the boss fight revolve around a couple of intuitive mechanics.  Don’t make the mistake of trying to squeeze in “every cool mechanic” into the boss fight.  Most importantly of all, allow for a variety of different strategies to beat the boss (i.e. minimise the use of boss ignore mechanics).  
---
Lastly I personally think season 4 overall feels a little rushed.  One moment I’m battling Joko, the next moment I’m battling Kralk.  I recall some discussion from Reddit late last year about the developers killing Joko sooner than expected so they could move onto the other plot points.   If that discussion was true, it could help explain why season 4 feels rushed.  I suspect this is simply a case of the developers trying to do too many things in season 4 and not having enough “screen time” to tell that story.  
---
The reason the "traumatic event" even happened makes no sense given his character, at all.
---
If you truly buy this bullshit rather than the simple fact GW2 has been moved further and further from GW1's human centric lore into the multiracial kumbaya with special starring of the Charr mascot race (clearly a member of the strictly atheist Black Citadel charr had to be the first fucking revenant, and not one of the norn shamans or humans who already walked the mists and interfaced with Glint) and the human gods were phased out to make room for narrative relevance to the other races, I've got a bridge to sell you.
---
Agreed.
---
I played up to around lvl 30-40, then made a new character and boosted. Leveling is boring. GW2 levelling is especially boring imo. 
---
I did eventually go and make a character from 0-80. But only once, after I finished HoT, was waiting for pod and wanted to know more about the lore.
---
IMO I would:
---
\- lvl 1 to until you get bored
---
\- Then boost. Its much better to enjoy the game then to get bored of the levelling.
---
\- If you boosted or eventually got 80 normally, go to PoF get the raptor mount. 
---
\- As soon as you get the raptor leave.
---
\- Go do HoT
---
\- Go do PoF
---
There are also living seasons. If you want to drop some money on them you are free to, but really they are like mini expansions and more focused on story and lore.
---
My order was HoT&gt; Normal story &gt; LW1 video&gt; LW 2 &gt; POF &gt; LW3&gt; LW4. But I suggest against this...It was broken, but I still enjoyed it and am really into the lore. But better to avoid the messif you can help it.
---
I know people want you play the game like the way it came. But lots of people quit before the fun stuff begins...all because people said don't boost or don't waste your time on doing x, y is more efficient. 
---
The whole point of the game imo is to have fun. So just play to have fun. There is no end game goal that is set in stone, you make your own. End game for you could be get full ascended or a legendary or full legendary or all achievements  or all jp achievements or world completion or even cats.
---
A lot of the better pets are in level 80 expansion zones but if you can find a Juvenile Lynx in the snowy areas, that does good damage.
---
 IT'S TIME FOR A LOOOOOT-SPLOSION!!!
---
The NCSoft dev was offended by the mixing of Asian cultures if I recall correctly. I can’t find the link at this moment. 
---
The game turned out very differently to what I expected. Which is a bit sad to be frank. But hey I still played a fee thousand hours for no good reason at all.  
---
If you want it you'll enjoy the content to get to it. You basically play the game.
---
I'll start off by saying that I consider GW1 a masterpiece, way ahead of its time and budget, and a game that remains very unique to this day. Also, it was the game I played when I had lots of free time during high school and just by hearing any part of its soundtrack floods me with nostalgia nowadays. 
---
So yeah, when they announced GW2 my expectations were basically impossible to match. And sometimes I still get frustrated thinking about what the game could've been if they followed GW1 more closely. I consumed everything about GW2 since this trailer dropped, pre-ordered, and ended up quitting after a couple of months playing it.
---
Recently I returned though, and while it'll never match GW1 in my eyes, it's still a game that has grown up well over the years and has a lot of content to offer, built on top of decent gameplay mechanics. MMOs are in a low point nowadays, given that every other game has heavy online elements, and to me GW2 is probably the best remaining one at this moment, specially given its business model.
---
I was expecting the same PvP-meta. Huge variety of builds. Not so much in this. 
---
Go for the two summon elemental skills. One is a regular utility and the other is elite. Between the two, you can keep a tanking pet with a clickable skill always up, and two tanks for big fights
---
I would switch them to other skills when in a group, but for solo content they work great. 
---
I thought that bit at the end, where you are limoing along, was cool. 
---
It reminded me of Modern Warfare 2 (I think it was that one), after the Nukes drop and you stagger through the fallout.
---
\*prays\* "A playable mesmer with a rapier. A playable mesmer with a rapier. A playable mesmer with a rapier. A playable mes- OH MY GOD YES LOOK AT THAT HERITAGE LIGHT ARMOR!"
---
Much agreed. I really enjoy nightmare and always hoped that they keep the direction. I can respect observatory and deepstone, but dafq is going on with oasis and sirens? I have absolutely no love and no respect towards trash mob / spam design and sincerely hope they return to elegance of nightmare. 
---
At least she'll have a guide for it!
---
When I said "exchanging integrated fractal matrices for encryption keys." I was talking about [integrated fractal matrices](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Integrated_Fractal_Matrix), you get one for free for each completed CM and these can't be sold. They are different from [stabilizing matrices](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stabilizing_Matrix), which are sellable on the trading post between aroung +/- 32s per unit.
---
No you don't fly ove him. You go to right place. Then the game makes move/fly to another place.
---
Yep, those cheap gw2 accounts from before HoT keep paying for themselves.
---
I didnt see it myself, but apparently in the last part there's a new dredge leader, implying that the one we knew died during the battle.
---
Buying is fast!
---
I find that its actually a fight for heal-fb. Stability helps with the wind, resistance helps with the condis, and projectile deletion helps with the adds. Once you get the team aspects down (green on boss, red away from boss) there's not much more to it.
---
Now..... the time it took to learn that was...rough.
---
Skritt math.
---
\*GoT theme music plays\*
---
Maybe both?
---
or managing to somehow get downed on the circle near Aurene (Where you'd use the skill to trap Kralk with her) at the end or something, idk
---
No i mean the Destroyer. Not an Elder Dragon, only a minion i know.
---
Well then I hope they were also offended by the mixing of African/Middle Eastern cultures in Elona...otherwise it’s hypocrisy.
---
Hello kite. Could you have the other elitists go through you for approval so we don't have to suffer from trash music anymore? Thanks in advance. xoxo.
