Sorry, did a quick scroll and didn't see it yet ;) It's seriously the only connection the brain can make when reading that sentence in such a context!
---

---
Well, assuming you know the episode, of course.
---
What'd be pretty cool is cross-class elite specs that either of two professions can take, so Swashbuckler would be the Warrior and Thief elite spec, Ritualist would be the Revenant and Necromancer one, Spellslinger could be Elementalist and Engineer, etc. and so long as it's limited to only two specs it wouldn't be crazy hard to balance.
---
Ah, a fellow Virtuoso! Thank you very much :) 
---
Play Dagger/Dagger Elementalist while working your way towards Sword/Dagger Weaver. You die if something looks at you wrong, but its fast-paced and a lot of fun.
---
I used to play tank druid for my wife in WoW and I think I'm subconciously trying to find something to take the tank role. I just want to hit and be it and take hits. I've heard that Mesmer is difficult to learn and tbh that's probably one of the reasons I chose it. I go big or go home. lol
---
It's not tricky at all. You play WvW for skirmish tickets. You can't find the time to play WvW for 5-8 hours? A couple hours a night ain't that bad plus try not to think about it enjoy the zerg/fights.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
We had plenty of time, and I mean days worth to "grind out" skirmish tickets as soon as they announced the info required for the mount. I don't think it's a big deal at all.
---
You eventually want to move towards berserker armor in pve according to lot of recommended builds, but I diverted to using marauder armor myself for some extra survivability.  Some stat selections offer the combo of berserker+valkyrie stats which is similar to marauder.  I got the longbow for better range, not dps, there some some things you want to fight at max range if possible.   For mobs, I use a trap build as a dragonhunter.
---
I don't know if you have Heart of Thorns or not.  But, if so don't forget to look under achievements/collections/specialization.  There are some ascended  weapons available to go on a treasure hunt to get.  The dragonhunter has a longbow there.   It will take some HoT map currency to get and crafting one item.
---
I don’t get it

Yeah, hahahaha.

One steelstar's inscription and ascended components dependend on the type of weapon you're crafting.
---
For example:

---
Dead.
---
"why can't I hold all this NA?" Anvil Rock
---
They are, but you can’t earn mastery exp unless you are on a lvl 80
---
It is more like 10-12 in total per weapon. But you have more than one cd so 5 days is quite accurate.
---
You can buy ascended materials from the tp ... they are not that expansive compared to past prices. But after all thunderhead peak is good for farming deldrimor steel at least. As long as you are using two chars you don't have to go anywhere else to get you materials. Maybe you can ask you guildmates for there cd? That would speed things up quite significantly. In the end not everyone is crafting 16 ascended weapons at the same time.
---
"i don't think anyone from elmry bay even plays wvw besides me"
---
as said talking means nothing. play vs decent player in higher pvp div like me plat3/ legend (i did the same pre pof with power chrono) and show some footage about how ez it is. actually no top player would ever complain about power mirage, esp not compared to metabuilds
---
Medium is still too high for world bosses and wvw.

Shark has abnormally high power as a DPS pet (with fear and a charge skill usable in merge), armorfish is super tanky, brown bear has condi cleanse still. Depends on if you think you'll be in water long enough to warrant a merge to consider the typing. The drakes are fine statwise as well and tiger can be used for fury.

Play through all the story lines, including the expansions and living world seasons.  Once that is done focus on getting all the hero points and mastery points you need to learn all the traits/skills.  You want gliding, mounts, etc and access to the living world maps.  Then you should think about which game modes you like and what ascended gear to craft.  Snowcrows has meta pve builds and metabattle has pvp wvw builds.  If you wanna do pve craft a zerker or viper ascended set (unless support is meta for that class) depending on if power or condi is met, learn the basic dps rotation on snowcrows, then join a guild that offers raid training.
---
I'm in no rush, and I almost never buy things I can craft or farm myself.  I have all the mats needed for ascended materials, so I'll slowly craft these weapons as time permits.  I think it is silly to put this timegate in though.

Hey Panda, been a while.  I would like to ask what is the most efficient ratio of topless charr to pantsless norn for doing grub raid runs on EBG?
---
Not a new player, but quite inexperienced with WvW. What are some WvW-specific acronyms that all newbies should be familiar with? (E.g. What or where is Bay?)
---
I've had this problem as well. Personal band-aid fix is to skip all cut scenes that you can. Worked for me at least
---
For the last year I was going to do an AMA on being an unrepentent fanboi of the game, which would have been hysterical and caused much drama, but I decided against it every time I'm tempted.  Wish you luck with this one.
---
I guess my only questions is do you have different accounts on EU and NA or did you transfer, and if you are playing out of region, how much lag do you get and what's your ping like?
---
Outfit/10.
---
I'm not saying outfits don't look nice. But I find more joy in looking at fashion people put together piece by piece.

The benefit I see is that I will play more Apex Legends.

The best part of this fame is that what you typed is impossible. By 80 you can have everything unlocked (except elite specializations which require a little extra work and expansions). If you think you’ll continue to enjoy your norn Ranger, by all means keep playing it. Like others have said, don’t delete any because birthdays!
---
Most EU servers haven't experienced the complete destruction of their server's community, infrastructure, and relationships due to off hours time zone coverage. This is not the case on NA. Therefore you still see a high amount of respect on the EU servers towards guild raiding, running meta builds, and fight culture.

When I got my sister and her bf into the game, I leveled up alongside of them with a newer alt. It made it a lot more fun for me and also gave them something a little more relatable than my main.

---
Medium w/that dx12proxy is pretty impressive in wvw, seamed to be better performance than the current w/low. The addon is worth a look for that reason alone really. 
---
Yeh, this is more grind than it is fun.  
---
what do you mean "off hours time zone coverage"?
---
So random question, just came back to the game a bit ago so I am out of the loop. Apparently all the pug commanders I happen to find are from Crystal Desert so who are our wvw guilds? 
---
- a sad guildless player
---
NN is a Mag thing.  Others servers usually use NC.  When servers would link with Mag they would always ask what is NN?  At times I am left Mag, but the toxicity got to me.  And with Boars chatting all day and pulling tacts, ugh.
---

---
I've really been enjoying my main (mesmer-&gt;chrono) and my soon lvl 80 alt (necro)
---
Very different classes but both fun in their own way: I like the ranged greatsword and the wells (AoE stuff) with chrono and the "nothing can kill me because I have so much health" death shroud spam with necro.
---
From west coast NA playing on alt accounts I usually get ~150-175ms. It's honestly not that bad unless you're dueling or pvping. The large macro plays in ZvZ tend to be pretty telegraphed and easier to avoid.
---
I don't know that it substantially increased the FPS, but doing this did cause my GPU to finally use the max clock speed at all times.
---
SBI: So many pugs, not enough pugmanders

I'm not agreeing with him. Just what I think he meant. ^^

Weary stare at nightcrew &amp; pugs: that's why we can never drop tiers. - Deso
---
You know how WvW is a 24/7 game mode? The most neutral way I can describe it is that over time some servers end up with more people than others and are able to decisively win their matchups due to sheer numbers. Being on the receiving end of this can lead to players feeling helpless and desire to transfer to servers with active communities in their time zone. The snowballing of this effect leads to a relative minority of players impacting the fights and matchups for a larger majority.

dT is to fractals as snowcrows is to raids, so yes they are a better source for fractals specifically. They are only concerned with meta groups and the top builds though. They will aim to min/max the builds as much as they can for fractals though and the balance patch is going in tomorrow so you might want to hold off on specific gear unless you're fine with stat swapping.
---
The game isn’t worth playing without D912pxy anyway.
---
Hey! I play a lot of healer Firebrand in fractals, thought id give some advice. 
---
So first off, you gotta keep up regeneration. You can do this with mace, F2 (with bottom trait in middle line of firebrand) or my personal favorite, cleanse mantra. Any one of these is enough, so if you run cleanse mantra for example, you don't need to use mace if you want to use something like axe or sword for fury.
---
Then we get to weaponskill healing. Mace is quite passive in its healing, it grants regen and heals a bit on the autoattack. Not much, honestly. However, if you run shield offhand, using skill 5 again while it's active heals allies within it. Staff is alos really good. Skill 2 actually heals a very good amount, and skill 4 is a huge heal. I tend to drop 2 then 4 when the group needs huge heals. For this, I like to run the staff trait in the Honor traitline.
---
Remember, when running Honor (which you should, your dodge roll heals allies! Honor is designed to let you dodge as much as possible, so remember to use this! 
---
Then, you have your F2 tome. This one has:
---
1: aoe heal
---
2: aoe condicleanse (also heals for every condi removed)
---
3: regen, swiftness and vigor(! this ones important)
---
4: pulsing aoe heal, really strong
---
5: enhances all healing granted to allies around you, this helps a lot with boosting the effects of the other tome skills so use this first or after you drop skill4
---
the F2 tome has quite a long cooldown, so I save it for when the team needs big healing. Also note that I use staff 2 and 4 first, to maximize my healing output. And if those two end up being enough, then I can just skip using the tome
---
Lastly, youre a guardian: you can always block damage for your team. Your heal mantra grants aegis, you can run retreat and use shield4. You can grant stability through skills like stand your ground and f3 tome skill 1/5, and you can give your team condi immunity through f3 tome skill 4. You can also remove/reflect projectiles using Wall of reflection, F3 skill3, and shield5.
---
In terms of traits, I don't know what metabattle recommends, but I always run honor (it has like all the heal traits) the exact traits are up to your choice, but I tend to go top-top-bottom. 
---
If you want extra healing, go virtues, it lets you share your F2 passive, and reduces coomdown on your tomes. If you want to support your teams damage, go radiance with &lt;anything&gt;-top-middle and run bane signet. This will allow you to share your signet passives with your team by activating them, which helps a lot! 
---
Can't you customize the colors?
---
This is weird, since mounts are, I think by most people anyway, more desirable than gliding.  I've seen very few people say that have to have gliding but many people say they have to have mounts.
---
thank you very much!
---
I’ll read it carefully
---
Congrats.  After I did that, I came away with a deep set hatred for Quaggon's.   No other heart vendor was as tedious:
---
 "OOOooooooooh Quaggon forgot how to catch food."  Catch food.  
---
"OOOOOOOoooh Quaggon forgot how to eat."  *Wait, what...seriously?*   Pre-chew food for 1% heart progress.
---
I was looking at Metabattle builds for Daredevil and Superior Sigil of Impact has replaced Superior Sigil of Air as the go to second sigil (after Force) - what gives? Is it just straight up better damage? For a PvE Deadeye build, would I be going for a Sigil of Impact as well or a Sigil of Bloodlust?
---
Is there hope for WvW server community on NA or will it boil down to a guild run mode?
---
One thing: what is cleanse mantra? Can’t find it in skill or build. I like axe better and happen to have an ascended axe so really want to not use mace
---
The only time Silver was worth it was during the small window after sigil/rune update and before Runecrafter Salvager was introduced. That was because during that window we used Mystic/Silver to Salvage greens. At that time, I burned though my Mystic Stones at such an alarming rate. 
---
Nowadays, not so much. Get Copper and Runecrafter then use Mystics for Rare gears. 
---
Reminds me of a kid I knew in middle school, we were looking at a poster that had an orange buggy on it, but he insisted it was yellow.
---
It's not that their range and damage isn't good, it's just that it's not useful in a zerg. You're not going to pick someone off from the side, as they're in a deathball and will just move into the deathball for safety from projectile attacks. 
---
It's called Mantra of Lore (utility skill) It cleanses conditions and grants regeneration, and the last charge converts conditions to boons and grants a huge amount of regen. Just using all charges will give perfect uptime on regen, but you can also save some for cleansing conditions if you need to. 
---
How does it feel to be part of the community Anet wishes didn't exist?
---
My honest question is how has the meta changing affected you and your experience over the last 2 years?
---
Found it! I used to run with mantra of potence for quickness. Will I still be able to cover most of the quickness up time if I’m not using this?
---
So been working on this for a few weeks got the idea after the Bless failure brought a huge influx of players back and new players into WvW who had tons of questions, and seemingly tons of answers. The idea was to create a clear idea of what they needed to know and how to get started in WvW. I hope it helps more players out there and feel free to give it to any new WvW player.

Likelihood is (along with the other veterans on the game's dev team that were let go), NCSoft didn't wanna have to fund the wage of a nonessential company veteran anymore when they could just replace him with a fresh-blood who will work for less money.
---
hx = home &lt;site&gt;
---
Meaning the thing that is closest to your spawn.
---
hc = home camp = camp closest to the borderlands spawn point
---
ht = home tower = tower closest to the borderlands spawn point

---
Okay honestly, **fuck you** for that.  It's not ARENANET's fault that all of NCSoft's other invested IPs also saw lower numbers across the board.  NCSoft being a greedy pile of shit is NO ONE ELSE's fault but their own.
---
For fractals:
---
**DH** for optimal party with all the meta classes, i.e. Having proper support like Chrono and Druid. 
---
**Power Quickbrand** in no Chrono groups. You sacrifice a bit of personal dps to boost the dps of your party by a lot. 
---
**Core Guard** for utilities. eg. when traited, F3 is an instant cast 5 man stun break, stability and Aegis with a 600 range. Core guard is great for struggling pugs and my personal favourite. 
---
**Condi Quickbrand**. Same role as Power Quickbrand, up to you whether you prefer Power or condi playstyle. In general condi equips require a bit of farming compared to power equips. 
---
**Support FB**. IMO the optimal support for fractals. It's like a weaker version of Chrono+Druid, but it frees up a slot for another dps. If that dps is a Renegade (brings Alacrity), all the better! Support FB equips is the most expensive of the bunch. 
---
Lmfao, have a good shit my good sir 
---
You have just taught me something about myself that several sessions of therapy couldn’t.
---

---
"At least we know how to RP."
---
you can already do main sword and main and off pistol you need to get a new weapon out of this u dont already have. so your options are axe, longbow, mace, warhammer, scepter, focus, and greatsword
---
More.
---
Exactly my thought. I don't tend to play nice with people pming me demanding information on something.
---
Just keep in mind taking thief in WvW is very different to taking thief in PvE, and not nearly as braindead - in fact it is probably one of the hardest classes to play, especially in larger fights.
---
If you screw up a stun break, dodge or rotation as a thief in WvW there is a decent chance it  will get you killed. You are need to know how to counter particular builds and classes: you can't #1 #1 #1 your way through anything.
---
i was thinking more like nobody communicates in the language of nsp and so nobody knows what the fuck their going to do, sometimes not even NSP
---
They dont have aoe for a reason. If you want to farm wvw in zergs get on a class thats does have aoe skills.
---
Just like how you need to get on a ranger to roam.
---
In 2019 their demands for better support seem more reasonable. In hindsight Anet probably did miss a good opportunity and ended up letting it stagnate as the more fervent voices got drowned out.
---
Actually, there was a time when people ran "no defence" kills. Everyone attack, kill bone walls, and attack some more. Of course there was defence of the cannons, but that was it.
---
You do realize you now have to craft a legendary, right?
---
all those letters in line hurted you ? call you sjw manager and find white man to acusse from rape. im just so fucking over you idiots,apologizing for anet and his useless balance team (3 ppl jerking off for 3 months) and than they puke some ultra off the target nerf/buff on some skill that no1 ever used. nope. kid im like NCsoft on this forum. i had enough of thier shit and your shit for 5 lifetimes,yet i endure and im gona find time to call you retard. you are welcome
---
When you see people you know in the street and dont know how to end the conversation.

NSP?
---
And this is why EOTM is dead content. "real wvw players" don't go there because it's not "real wvw". PvE players don't go there because they only play wvw when they *have* to play it to get rewards they can use in the rest of the game, and those rewards are accrued faster (or exclusively) in "real wvw". So who the hell is EOTM *for?*
---
A bag is a bag, if he wants another shot at it, gud for him. WVw needs more players, not less. 
---
I still haven't finished mawdrey.... 
---
If you're a true cliff troll, you start the channel and use Judge's Intervention right as the channel is about to finish.
---
I wish I could say that
---
Unfortunately for this idea, EOTM is *huge* compared to a borderland, so it'd require some serious reworking to the point where it's practically a new Borderlands map. And look at how the WvW community viewed the last new Borderland map.
---
That narrows it down to about 100 guilds...
---
"STAY ON THE FUCKING TAG!!!"

I agree, I like piecing together the wardrobe over picking outfits but I've yet to find anything that has the look that Im going for which is kind of a "Phantom of the Opera"/Jhin/Marvelous Chester kind of theme. Something that gives off the feel of a refined and aristocratic killer. If you have any suggestions on individual pieces that look like that, let a killer know will ya? ;)  
---
With the sigil rework all the slayer sigils got 3% base + 7% bonus with conditions met. The 3% always is better than air sigil (3 sec ICD 279 base damage) for DPS. In raids most of the other sigils will never activate (night, demon slaying, etc) so the best in slot option is impact which will trigger on some bosses that get stunned (like KC) and give you a major damage bonus during that time.
---
For PvE force is still best in general since it is 5% always, some builds want accuracy to cap crit chance but in general any of the slaying sigils (3% always) will beat out air. If you want to have bloodlust that works too but is not useful in organised PvE content like raids where you can't use it.
---
Been there, done that

As the that other guy said, core usage measurement is not an exact science. You are certainly cpu bound. GW2 single thread isn't as optimized as prime 95, there are non computation related bottlenecks within the cpu too.

It's quite the opposite. People who actually value their sanity left the game cause waiting so fucking long for new wings is insane. So mostly "shit players" inhabit raids these days.

Don't forget the extra health from the shroud which is pretty quick to fill up. I actually leveled up mesmer as my first character and compared to that my necro is a tank.

Did you read the "how do I install" section on delta's website?
---
&gt;  make sure vs2013 and directx june2010 runtimes are installed - linked below in 'its not working'.
---
 save d3d9.dll into 'gw2 install dir/bin64/' with the other dlls while the game is not running.
---
Also check the "it's not working" section:
---
&gt;check your 'gw2 install dir/addons/arcdps/' folder for an arcdps.log (will appear after you launch and are in char select).
---
 if there is no log, it isn't being loaded. it is up to you to find out where your system is trying to load it from.
---
 if there is a log, check to see there are no warnings or errors and that the date isn't old, if it is old, see above.
---
 if you use the nopatchui switch, d3d9.dll needs to be placed next to gw2.exe.
---
 if you get a module: coherentui.dll error on launch (0x7e), make sure directx9 june2010 runtimes is installed.
---
 if you get a module: coherentui.dll error on launch (0x7e) or msvcr120.dll error, make sure visual c 2013 x64 redist is installed.
---
 if you get a module: coherentui.dll error on launch with any other error code, you can look up the code here.
---
 if the game crashes on character select, another application may be interfering (eg d3dgear).
---
 if folders can't be created or settings not saved, make sure gw2.exe has read/write permission to the folder it's installed in.
---
If that still doesn't solve it see what error your Arc is posting to the folder or if it's creating an error log at all.
---
literally never seen any of these used before

" Arachnophobia affects 3.5 to **6.1 percent** of the global population. " Saying no to awesome spider mount because of that is most stupid excuse they could think of I guess.

This link is semi-up-to-date. There's a better one out there that's more recent, but you should be able to find your server there. If not, just ask in team chat or map chat when you get in.
---
DING DING DING!
---
Its the frog king from shrek elite spec.
---
What? - guess the server
---
This is actually adorable XD
---
BP is like eating a goat penis, it's a unique delicacy and an interesting story but you're not telling your friends you ate it or telling them to try it either. 
---
If you're really hating yourself try to complete the Heart of thorns maps now. 
---
That's not true for Scrapper which has a very useful support build that could even become even better with the Gyro rework that will be introduced in this balance patch.
---
Then Daredevil has nice usecases but it's indeed more for organized groups and GvG than pug zergs.
---
I run ~110-120 ping and haven't missed a big yet with the front-to-back-to-front strategy with a bit of a wiggle as I do so. Yeah, it kinda sucks, but you'll get consistent at it before long.
---
Make sure you stick with the big until it triggers. There's plenty of time to grab smalls afterwards, so don't leave that big sucker until its been consumed! In the video you linked, you _barely_ didn't get close enough to eat the big the first time, and by the time you reacted you didn't have any time for a decent second attempt before it hit the bug zapper.
---
why dont you do your daily ascended crafting every day?
---
Borlis Pass - cool server is cool 
---
I've encountered this glitch far too many times. It makes the Springer jump insanely high. I made it all the way from the ground to the mastery point in Malchor's Leap one time xD
---
How's the game for a new player in 2019? Still worth going into? Are there endgame content that's soloable? (I've had a bad experience with group endgame content in WoW so that's that for me lol)
---
Can someone please hook me up with a legit,” I just hit 80 now what?” Guide or check list. Preferably not a video. 
---
Harold. His name is Harold.
---
We only do well when we're matched up with a good server, despite us being a host server.
---
When I reached the 100% Map Completion for the first time, I felt happy and kind of empty at the same time. Good Job Mate 🤘🏼

THIS IS FINE
---
Guides how to pugmand WvW?
---
Are all classes viable in some way in WvW? And how much deviation is there typically in build/gear from the raid/open world choices?  
---
(I'm definitely a PvE scrublord whose interest in WvW isn't related to the new mount, but I've still never participated.)
---
Err what game mode? I personally LOVE scrapper for pvp but depends 
---
FBI OPEN UP
---
Parental units? They don’t get those until they’re through school and enrolls in one of the colleges!
---
You don't even have to do WvW anymore.
---
Piken?
---
Do no agree with that. I play from SEA(~220) ping and do front to back and don't miss the orbs.
---
While I agree that Breakbars need to be explained ingame, I don't see why CC should. No other MMO explains stuns and silences in an dedicated tutorial. People need to start reading their skills in my opinion.
---
Oh god the PTSD
---
Isn't that kind of the opposite of what OP is suggesting?
---
&gt; Most EU servers haven't experienced the complete destruction of their server's community, ..., due to off hours coverage gaps
---
Nope, don't think so...lots of people transfered
---
Every orb behaves like this when you fighting Dhuum in Asia.
---
I know it's physic limits that you must have 200+ ping when you try to connect with servers at the other side of the planet. But I really hope Anet can make the contents not rely on ping so much. (like catching a dislocation moving orb!!)
---
Thats fine ping actually...You literally just started moving away from it right before it registers. You always go through it and never leave it before the sound queue. 
---
You’ll want to hit up a guy in game named Aristocratic Asura. He’s a Mag legend for soloing towers in his omegas.
---
In no particular order:
---
* Omegas can splash multiple targets if you stand close enough to a physical obstruction like a wall while aiming.
---
* Omegas can hit siege on the far side of a wall by targeting them using Action Camera.
---
* Movement speed modifiers affect golems.
---
* Guild and Alpha golems are optimal for ninjaing Alpine garrison since they their auto-attacks are audibly quiet.
---
* Boons and buffs affect golems. Alacrity/quickness are nice DPS boosts.
---
* If running with a zerg Scourges should be the ones hopping into golems. Assuming you’ve got a couple pieces of Cav trinkets your crit chance should be boosted close to w/o exceeding 100%. Giant robots also help protecting you from getting one-shot.
---
Time to make some legendaries? 
---
From the wiki: "The final reward chest of most [PvP Reward Tracks](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/PvP_Reward_Track) and [WvW Reward Tracks](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/WvW_Reward_Track) include two Mystic Clovers as part of their reward. Several non-repeatable regional reward tracks award seven instead"
---
Which tracks is it talking about?
---
Ehh according to this...You were never really inside the orb's hitbox and you even started to move away from it before you tough it. So yeah in this specific case you did miss it.  
---
I've always wanted to get into WvW and I've been searching for a guide lately, so thanks!
---
Self promotion, but I wrote [this guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Gulbasaur/Things_I_Wish_Someone_Told_Me_-_A_new_player_guide#At_level_80) that could help you.
---
Basically:
---
* Fractals: short challenge dungeons.
---
* Raids: 10-person mechanically challenging puzzle boss dungeons.
---
* Living Story and Expansions: New maps, new story, new specs, new gears. 
---
* Collections, crafting and legendaries. 
---
* Join an *active* guild. This adds so much to the game with events, raid training and group stuff. 
---
After drinking MMO gameplay at it's worst.
---
Game is 6y and 6m old....
---
The groups will be full and you will not get into a squad as a thief if the commander has a pick of who can join and who to kick.
---
Ideally you will be Firebrand, Scourge or Herald. If those are unavailable try Elementalist.
---
Well it is easier to join a game when a blob of angry players are not yelling at you for trying to fight a challenging mob which the blob consider their property ;)
---
Holy shit! This is awesome! XD
---
If you plan to play in a zerg, i'd say ranger is easier to play than Scourge or Rev, you just stand back and longbow things to death
---
Sad but true. Anet claims boonshare chrono is still too strong!
---
Yeah, the mount will most certainly just kill all thieves in an area around the warclaw upon mounting up. If they somehow survive this, they will automatically be debuffed to be way slower than a snail until the mount is so far away that they will never be able to catch up.
---
It's open source?
---
or your thief can use a mount too
---
Edge of the mists used to be really good for that. They kinda killed it though.
---
Don't forget that they'll get a damage debuff, where their damage output is lowered by 50%!
---
Whenever i get these encounters i go along with it to see what happens, its good entertainment.
---
I actually ended up with chronic pain that was triggered by keyboard and mouse use - and as a programmer, I had to use what "pushing through it" I could manage in the office. Phones didn't stress my sore muscles in the same way. So this actually happened to me.  
---
Fortunately, there is a world of games on phones that really work for the medium. Puzzle games, point-and-click adventures - the port of Myst was gorgeous and a wonderful walk down memory lane. Monument Valley was of course highly acclaimed, and I found it a perfect fit for mobile gaming. Lately I've been playing Baldur's Gate on my phone. It's not perfect - fights are tough, a tablet would really be about right. But, it works well enough to while away a commute. There are a lot of little games like that, from the known to the oddball indie, and - while it wasn't my first choice for gaming - I did have fun exploring an area of games I might not have otherwise put much time into. Oh, and Ingress was a blast! Exercise was pretty much the only thing the doctors could point me at, so I needed to spend a lot of time walking around - and my work's neighborhood was littered with portals.   
---
Did I "seriously game"? I dunno. I've never been a competitive gamer. I like co-op, puzzles, story, exploration, and art. I like GW2 because it gives those things, and I can share it with my family. Now that I'm healthy again (HEALTH IS AMAZING FOLKS!!!), I am gaming with my family through GW2. I don't like fighting them, even in a game - so co-op for story missions, dungeons, fractals, and open world is perfect. I do enjoy a little WvW from time to time, too - though I haven't tried it yet since recovering.
---
I've never seen any Tempest builds on Metabattle for WvW. I do it in PvE all the time, but if I'm not using Staff I don't have enough range for zergs.
---
Short answer really is GW2 is pushing the limits of DX9, and you can only do so much with 12 year old tech.
---
This is basically how WvW will be post-patch XD
---
Have you met my [Druid](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8j2z6z/permafrost_verdant_brink_night_time_sylvari/)? 
---
I believe they made this client side. Still mechanic is clunky and i often pass twice trough orb since it doesnt disappear instantly. 
---
i had so many orbs just flying straight through me even when im directly in front of them.. that whole mechanic is shit (and no, uts not my ping which is usually around 60)
---
yea, i need to find a guild that will let me have permissions to go poke around since my main guild left WSH and moved back to GH. 
---
They don't counter staff daredevil which is literally the only somewhat relevant thief build in groups...
---
You might be joking, but it's true. Ofc you gonna notice things easier when you have alot of experience in it. But basically all mmos let you costumize the hell out of ui
---
I wasnt the person that crafted the legendary :) 
---
I labeled myself on the pic as blue one
---
EU always had the stronger an more organized population.
---
the language specific servers on EU (french, spanish, german) can only be linked which each other so there will always be a group playing at all times. also the french and spanish speaking communities have ppl from all around the world (canadians, middle and south americans, etc.) different time zones ---&gt; better coverage.
---
Most of the time they are useless outside of squad too. Some bvbs are so pirateship heavy ranger is worthwhile but it requires very specific conditions. 
---
With the added bonus of being relatively discreet. This may not seem like a big deal to a lot of us who have an identity that includes "gamer", but for a lot of people - especially women and specifically mothers - that discretion is a doorway to enjoy a hobby without having strangers or meddling friends and relatives making rude comments on how you spend your time, or how you ought to be paying more attention to your kids or responsibilities. The bias isn't as strong these days - but that's a major shift in the last decade. And still, "serious gamer mother" conjures up the image of the media-hyped neglectful mom playing WoW while her infant starves for a significant minority of non-gamers.  
---
Even my once "I will never play a video game because they are time sucks that will take me away from my children" sister does a few rounds of Angry Birds these days. The times, they are a-changing.
---
however will we defeat mounts with their 12k health and 0 toughness
---
Well, you were a light gamer but I mean all of the games that suck the battery life out of your mobile.   I could play those types of games you mentioned on one but I mean MMORPGs or MOBAs or even FPS etc...  not counting the screen size, or how dang hot your mobile device will get with those games for hours on end, your mobile device ceases to be mobile as you will need to be tethered to the wall to supply juice to it as the battery will drain down to nothing lickety split.
---

&gt;!am warrior!&lt;
---
I have a similar problem with memory issues caused by medication. What worked for me was finding a guild to run with and liberal use of post it notes.
---
Learning firebrand I had post its on my monitor that said what each tome/skill does (stability etc). Each time we regroup I would read them again to remind me before the next fight. I also played a firebrand in pve to practice with the tomes. I still have trouble remembering the names but I'm much better at remembering what they do and I haven't had the notes up for a while. I think I'll try the same trick to learn another class.
---
It really does help to have a great group to run with. Getting in teamspeak or discord is important, to hear the calls but also to get to know who you're playing with and their play style. I joined my guild because I liked the style of the commanders, but it turns out they're all awesome. No one expects you to be perfect, having fun is still the most important thing but if you want to learn and improve they'll help you. 
---
Sit down. You're grasping for straws. Either that or you can't read my post.
---
Bye.

---
This \^ WASD for movement, C and V for special action and taget a mob and all the UI panel on keyboard. Everything else is mouse only :D Since mounts are a thing I dont have a single free button anymore xD 
---
Best mouse for all the games btw 
---
Just keep the chest and decide whenever you need something... they drop too often anyway that that slot is used up anyway.
---
Im not saying it's very bad. But I prefer to have less info, and dont habe paint splatters and smudges all over mu hud. That wouldn't be an issue, if the devs let you tweak it in the options, but so far, the options are extremely limited, compared to basicly all mmorpgs I' ve played. And I've played ALOT of them
---
Isn't that guy who was banned on twitch for some hate speech and who months ago deleted his characters and said he will never play gw2? 
---
~~TL:DW~~ - Note: Still too long, but its here if you don't care to watch and want to know. I may have misunderstood some topics and I certainly don't agree with some of the points mentioned. 
---
* GW1 is awesome
---
* sex is good
---
* GW2 was hype
---
* Some talk about sPvP balance issues (specifically Druid w/ pets and Chronomancer)
---
* GW2 is pay to win in sPvP b/c of specializations
---
* More sPvP - ESL was great and brought in viewership
---
* GW2 is great b/c of it's combat
---
* Desert Borderland hate
---
* Doesn't play or log in anymore, deleted everything
---
* Suggests the layoffs were justified by the current state of the game, specifically through the lack of changes and large gaps between balance patches
---
* lack of communication and large gaps between patches ... game became boring for him and didn't allow him to produce lots of content
---
* Why haven't the GW2 playerbase rised against these issues
---
* GW2 isn't catering to the community, specially notes WvW community as an example Anet should expand on 
---
* GW2 isn't taking chances, no extra effort on specific community (like WvW), and the lack of marketing for PoF
---
* Dislikes the casual community
---
* Not seeing any of the work that Anet's teams are doing, notes the lack of content from WvW Devs and sPvP only having point capture/rotate
---
* Wan'ts a better new player experience and more out of GW2
---
* More developer bashing and give up on GW2
---
* stopped watching at this point... peace
---
So cute :3

If you're a human and choose "I never recovered my sister's body" as your greatest regret, surprise! It turns out she wasn't dead after all.
---
This has nothing to with being selfish. He is a 30 year old tomato who makes sex jokes expecting to be taken seriously. Immature is the word you were looking for.

This is the same reason all those restaurants buy the plastic display food.
---
Is a curse not merely a misunderstood blessing?
---
I am quite positive a good teef will still outrun  a warclaw. At least in non friendly territory for the mount.
---
&gt; PvP legend who achieved Rank #1 Ranger in GW2 in 2018
---
Unless he defeated [Ajax Blue](https://youtu.be/gaWcAek5_JE), the greatest player in the game since 2012, this mouthbreather has no right to an opinion.
---
I know that, but I would like to know if I actually did something wrong, or people just being a bit shit. There were pretty much equal ammounts of both in my experience. 
---
Daww, I love Pocahontas.
---
tits or ass?
---
Depends for what, Scrapper is being turned into a tanky support for WvW or an OK support for fractals and WvW. Can be also used as an immortal tank for tagging things in meta events.
---
Holosmith is DPS for Raids, fractals, PvP.. basically a damage powerhouse. Just sucks for WvW zergs, go roaming instead.
---
roaming in WvW sounds more like a horror game sometimes
---
Amen bröther. Now let us pray; 
---
pray for their sorry souls, lest their misunderstanding remain.
---
Now I'm thinking that you actually watched the video.
---
Dragonhunter and Guardian won't change much since we drop from 140% crit chance to 115%...
---
We might be using 'perfect Inscriptions' tho because it got a buff and now applys the passive to Guards as well.
---
So damagewise nothing changed just our stun and damage for group options got better.
---
That is if you play the normal full berserker build, if you got valkyrie equip you're fucked.
---
He sure seems hurt by the truth, look at him nearly foaming at the mouth :x 
---
I can do it in 1 word: dead
---
https://i.imgur.com/DFCG5gM.jpg
---
What's wrong with things being even? That's how the game should be, even, not slanted towards one class.
---
Well I think I have the right to state that I have high standarts for ui  because game art is my nresd and butter throughout my whole life, and I even have alot of actual practice in the field. This made me way more picky than I was a teenager. That might sound haughty, but it wasn't the intent.
---
My problem, mainly, is with all the paint splatters all over skill bar, xp, bar and all the other ui elements. Idially devs would ley you turn off flavour/decor textures, and move stuff around. Even warhammer online (2008) had an option to disable all the flavor textures and move/resize everything in the hud, and believe you me, I did. Now alI have to rely on ICM to at least hide most of these things.
---
Anet doesn't let you do that natively
---
We are never sure how long ICM will remain functional.
---
Was curious on what other people feel about this. But got shat on instead. Yay. 
---
DB is a healthy mix of memes, bandwagoning seasons, and pugs but at least Monkey is in baby jail so our linked server is safe.
---
It depends on your boon duration. I run a build without any boon duration beyond what I get from fractal potions, so I need potence and the two quickness traits from Firebrand to do it.
---
I would recommend just standing around and using your quickness share skills on cooldown to see how your uptime is, that's how I figured out what I would need for perfect uptime.
---
I would though recommend still using mantra of potence since it gives might. Together with staff and a renegade in the party (or Empowering Might in Honor if you don't have one) that should get you capped on might.
---
My utilities bar typically has mantra of potence, mantra of lore, then the last slot is bane signet if I'm running Radiance, and a skill depending on the fight if I'm not. (Such as stand your ground, wall of reflection, etc)  Heal skill is always mantra and elite is always feel my wrath. 
---
I did it once for the badge on my head. Never again. Would rather play with other humans then shitty hearts.
---
You are completely disillusioned with guild wars 2 if you think posting a Bik video here is going to count for anything. 
---
Yep sold mine 400g
---
Dunno man, I took a 4 years break from GW2 since I was frustrated by the vanilla content even before HoT came out.
---
Compared to MoP and early WoD there was absolutely nothing to do in Guildwars.
---
I returned and picked up my main Guardian from back in the days, I'm glad he didn't got gutted (toolkit wise) and got meta in the meantime. *'lol'*
---
If you had a mainclass you crafted your legendary for back then you might want to start there again. Maybe read into some Guides whats expected from players nowadays.
---
The real reason is the prevalence of projectile block effects. Speaking plainly, I fail to see a reason for them to even exist in the game in the first place, save for maybe the shields on siege weapons that should mainly protect against other siege. Most other RvR type games have burned their hands with these OP types of utility. Anet haven't been doing their homework. At the very most, every projectile block effect should have limits of projectile absorption. One wall should not be able to block 200 shots from an entire blob.     
---
As it stands right now, they just need to make ranger longbow attacks unblockable at all times and not just 6/30 seconds. The damage is rather weak and gimmicky and the piercing arrows trait does not even work properly most of the time given the terrain we have. 
---
I wasn't aware of that. Thanks for the heads up.
---
Grind them out you are gimping yourself hard with core vs weaver. 
---
pic seems accurate for the extent of your horizon in terms of gw2, whereas i dont think its that bright.  have a nice day and let the sun in! &lt;3
---
I meant that in connection with breakbars, as you need cc skills to break them.

---
This is why I train noobs on Sloth and Matthias *exclusively* as heal scourge.
---
If you do not have already, collect Mastery Points for autoloot. Then start PoF and tame mounts. 
---
try turning down shadows, reflections, character models and quality, and set the checkmark in "effect LOD"
---
"Hello Kodash - oh shit im on Drakkar Lake ... ah no i changed my server again .... Hello Riverside!"
---
xD German - WvW - Mentality 
---
I like the clear layout and how it guides the new player with simple instructions, however, you do need to rework the builds and probably other points, too.
---
[Check here](https://metabattle.com/wiki/WvW) which ones are currently meta or at least "good".
---
This and going through them side to side works best for me
---
I have pretty reliable ping but the big orbs are definitely more tricky to pick up than the small ones (which you can basically look at to pick up)
---
Thief needs more stealth and mobility yes lmao 
---
an error message would be nice to actually know what is happening.
---
For example, if you use any things like reshade, gemfx, sweetfx, Arcdps or other things and haven't updated it it could crash your game. or just driver issues. 
---
Post a picture or the text of the error message and we can say more about the problem.
---
What's going to be the fastest way to get the mount with minimal effort?
---
That's okay, I thought it said something Raisin. I was a bit perplexed haha.
---
what is "ICM"?
---
I’d actually recommend played core ele over weaver if you’re new to the game mode/class. It’s much simpler to use and dmg wise u should not be too far behind. 
---
Immersive Combat Mod. Pretty popular ans widely used, from what I gathevered. 
---
Outnumbered on all map.
---
You need to own HoT to glide, should be the same case here and you need PoF to mount.
---
State of WvW 2019 is like State of WvW 2018 and 2017... hmm and 2016, too. ;P
---
That's weird. You can download it to your HDD, then just move/copy whole folder to SSD. 
---
Wonder if everything came out okay lol.
---
They are core builds for zerg play, and I tried to choose ones that will not shift today with the balance patch, I also made clear these builds are not for players with established in WvW. These are core builds designed for players just coming into WvW, hence the link to meta battle once you get more experienced in the game. I also tried too choose ones with increased survival for new players.   
---
Obviously not going to be the most amazing builds but rather a stepping stone as an intro into WvW for players without any xpansions trying to get into the game. I do plan to update them later and flush it out after todays patch just really wanted to get the basic tips, masteries and warclaw info.  
---
The combo field page was actually requested by other pins so I threw it in there as they think people should know about it.
---
I choose to leave it out as siege as it is a tactivator, whose purpose is camp defense, while only doing a few hundred siege damage. I did not want to confuse new players into thinking it was full blown siege. 
---
mount speed in neutral/enemy territory is pretty much same as foot + swiftness, i'm sure they will be fine
---
For which rarities of UnID loot is this true? 
---
I usually tell people if you don't like/use the siege save it for last. For example a warrior may often hop on an AC for bags in a tower or a ram due to their bunkery nature. A elementalist likely would not man the ram as they are less bunkery and would stick to ranged siege. Generally though Shield Gens, Golems (if your server uses them), Rams, AC, and Cats are all pretty clutch for what they give.
---
Dungeons can be done as soon as you start unlocking them (level 30+), Fractals are only 80. If you want to run the dungeons and don't know them start an [LFG](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Looking_For_Group) for teh dungeon you want and just mention that you're new or doing story. It's also perfectly fine to wait till you are 80 to do dungeons, there is no rush at all. Dungeons havn't been updated in a long time so they can be very easy, it does depend on the exact dungeon path though. Fractals do have guides out there [like this one](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16bt-vFeeLAeEsaoz72bkc4ZODsudIQ2hiQdvSnFYLtw/edit) and there are sites out there designed for end game builds and strategies like [discretize](http://discretize.eu) but you can totally jump in to fractals and work your way up. I'd be happy to give you some more pointers or train you if you're interested as well.
---
Can someone give me a quick recap of the current standing of ele and necro in the different game types from a community perspective. 
---
if I was a cool doctor I'd prescribe a blunt and a trip to a hookup sauna instead of taking us all on this odd video game/boning review hybrid because it strikes me as rather odd and I'm not sure if I'm supposed to feel vaguely threatened, aroused, or both
---
Okay. Thanks for letting us know.
---
As you can see from what I wrote that's exactly what I did. Just wondering why is it so? 
---
"Oh look WSR is T1 again, nice OUTNUMBERED and all those enem... fuck all the zergs." - my solo roaming experience
---
Is it me or do people forget what happens when your mount dies? Free knockdown.
---
Wait, can sigils now be swapped on legendary weapons? I thought it was only legendary armor with runes.
---
Same folder. C:\Games 
---
Saw somewhere that Program Files directory is causing issues for gw2
---
For anyone wondering how to do this: hold forward, and quickly use the engage skill, dodge, and Bond of Faith (w + 1 + v + 7).
---
I can only think of two reason this happens then.
---
1. On the HDD you got a working Asset server
---
2. the launcher has no or the wrong permissions on the SSD
---
Have you tried changing the asset server?
---
close but not really, it was with Jackal attack+TP+YEET.
---
Thinking of heal renegade for WvW would it be worth it with alacrity might etc? Tablet reflection could be useful aswell.
---
I was thinking a mix of stats like magi and Harrier's but im guessing minstrel would be more mandatory?
---
Was my very first thought. Finally the shortbow 5 abuse were the half dead thief runs off in the sunset to reset his hp and then comes back and so it goes is going to be catched. 
---
Sorry you get not upvote from me, this should have been adressed long time ago. Your free hp reset was never valid to have anyway.
---
Yes you can swap sigils as you swap runes on armor.
---
&gt; Note to self: Dont start developing UI for video games or it takes out all the fun to play them
---
Why do you think none of the developers play their games? 
---
So can we finally get to that castle in the sky now?
---
Oh sweet! The last time I played they where mentioning doing that but it. Glad to see they did it
---
Not sure what the attack does in this case..
---
Elementalist is hardest class to play with i would say in end game content but really fun and rewarding. Raids and fractals you may find yourself on the ground alot but if you git gud your dps is top notch.
---
Necro is a self sufficient class that can do most content solo. Group content they lack a bit of damage and support wise they are average. Lack of strong single target dps hurts necro a bit. They do have Heal scourge build which is good for pugs in raid though. 
---
Pvp wise necro is overall more solid than ele. Though that may change as ele got some buff and may get more playtime. Scourge in PvP tournaments are a no brainer. Ele with weaver is a strong 1v1 duelist but thats about it.
---
Try running the launcher as admin, or if that doesn't work try installing in c:/program files. Might be that the launcher doesn't have write permission on the root folder of the C drive
---
To some extent, network speed/latency between you and the server.
---
[He-Rold!](https://youtu.be/5LJkxx_leQE)
---
I was messing around on it soloing towers and stuff .. it's a chill place for anyone that wants to get reward track progress without the stress of actually fighting other players I guess.. about it really.
---
It would be nice if we could say : I spawned you so let me kill you ....
---
Don't mind me asking what weapon is that?
---
NN was around long before the cesspool that was Mag. 
---
&gt;or pool when you tell them too
---
What do you expect. They're animated sacks of bones and rotten meat, of course they'd be braindead. 
---
But in all seriousness, you can always destroy them instead of waiting for them to die. And mounts have made moving about easier, because you don't have a wild mount agroing everything and their mother while mounted. 
---
[Oblivion.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Oblivion)
---
Well the patch balance changes go live in about 6 hours but right now:
---
PvE: weaver (elementalist elite spec) is one of the highest DPS options but is still difficult to play well. You can see [fractal build here](https://discretize.eu/builds/elementalist/power-sword-weaver) and [raid build here](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/elementalist/weaver/sword/). Can also run as a [power DPS tempest](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/elementalist/tempest/power/) or a [support healing tempest](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/elementalist/tempest/heal/). The healing tempest build is getting some major buff this patch and may see some more play.
---
Scourge is a decent PvE pick for some raids as a [conditon DPS](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/necromancer/scourge/condition/) but it gets outclassed by better options on most fights. Can also be played as a [off healer](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/necromancer/scourge/heal/) providing barrier, might, and is able to res downed players very quickly. Reaper is played as [power DPS](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/necromancer/reaper/power/) but is currently one of the lowest DPS options, the patch is giving it a big buff and we may see more of them in [fractals](https://discretize.eu/builds/necromancer/power-reaper) and raids depending on what benchmarks they get.
---
WvW: [Zerg Builds here](http://builds.vabbi.org/). [Other WvW options here](https://metabattle.com/wiki/WvW). Weaver is played as a DPS backline, mainly dropping huge damage meteor showers and trying not to get killed. 
---
Scourge is mainly played as power or celestial and is **very** strong though the balance patch hopes to reduce their power. Reaper is still pretty strong as a roamer but the patch changes are aimed at PvE and it won't change much in WvW.
---
PvP: I don't play a ton of PvP but as far as I know [scourge](https://www.godsofpvp.net/builds/necromancer) is still one of the best teamfighters in the game and a strong meta choice. Reaper has burst damage and is also a good choice even if not quite meta. [Weaver](https://www.godsofpvp.net/builds/elementalist/) is pretty good at holding it's own but was still not top tier.
---
It is, and it's much more idiot proof than weaver. But the scrapper changes are also nice, and so it might be that tempest is still the worst choice of the 2.
---
I'd probably still rather 75% or more of the current Weaver mains play tempest instead though, because the amount I see who do less damage than firebrands and have less sustain than necros is shocking. 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Oblivion
---
Hey thanks for the suggestion, I'll give it a shot! 
---
Sorry to be rude but they're all bad and youd be better off copying pre hot meta builds.
---
Added survivability is a lie. Take ele for example... arcane brilliance, arcane blast and arcane power while pretending its survivable. It's just bad and new players will die repeatedly. Sigil of night...
---
Better give them a real heal, actual defensive utilities and imo even a self sufficient build rather than hoping they'll coordinate single target focus with arcane blast. And if u really want arcane, why arcane blast over arcane wave? Full dps traits and utilities and they'll be dead on the floor or out of range to actually use their dps.
---
Guard with battle presence over indomitable courage. Gl with stab and stunbreaks. You lose battle presence as soon as you use f2, which is likely first push against scourge when not playing fb. No group stunbreak. Retreat is worse than other shouts.
---
Similar with the rest. This stuff feels like piken all over again. Suggest terrible builds then defend them by saying it's a special adapted meta for noobs. 
---
Guild panel &gt; History &gt; Treasury ?
---
Honestly, the entire video belong in r/IHaveSex.
---
WvW zergs tend to want the damage reduction and resistance from a herald (along with the boons they give) more so than needing alacrity and reflection (they already get ranged AoE reflect bubbles from firebrand). Usually you're more useful to the group by actually providing good ranged damage in addition to your normal utility. If you do decide to go support, then yes full minstrel is exactly what you want.
---
No way this is gonna be patched soon
---
Oh! Daddy Cali is commanding!
---
Ranger's elite classes are both decent to good in endgame content.  Soulbeast has by far the easiest DPS rotation and produces acceptable numbers for raids, and druid is still highly sought-after as well.  But to be honest, outside of raids and the highest tier of fractals you can use more or less whatever you want and it works fine.
---
Longbow ranger is how I started my first toon and it's great for open world, the extreme range along with a pet makes you quite safe
---
Raid: Everyone.
---
Now it will be "fixed", like the griffon :I.
---
I just did it recently on my alt account for griffon.  We had like 3 people total as well. I played a core guard so was cleaving mobs down fast before they can do much damage. 
---
Save dungeons for later, I did some with a friend when we both had lvl 80 characters with exotic gear. No meta builds or anything but they were totally doable even if having more people would be optimal.
---
By the way, I suggest you to just play whatever class interests you and forget about the meta. Every class is viable, open world PvE is really forgiving and the most important thing is to have fun.
---
Hells yes. Though us FF have all been on break lately lol
---
I feel your pain from here.
---
big thx &lt;3
---
Yolosmith
---
Yeah, I was just procrastinating mostly.
---
This is Verdant Brink Floating Airship Cargo in a nutshell.
---
why do you look like an orange with high blood pressure
---
That was called a balance patch. ;)
---
Well there's a meta comp - 2dps, bannerslave, and either chrono+druid (the safe way), quickbrand+rev (for more advanced groups, that know their stuff imo, but much better dps and buff duration).
---
And it doesn't really matter which instabilities are there today, this is the comp most, if not all t4 groups run.
---
So no, instabilities don't really influence the group setup that much.
---
haloween utility things transforms characters - no idea if it works in combat too?
---
The only thing "pass off as my own" is that it is compilation of information I compiled with GW2 players I know and even state as such in the beginning page, so I am sorry you feel this way but that clearly was not the intention and I will adjust it when I get a chance, the site cannot be adjust from mobile. 
---
The griffon bug removed a big part of it's requirement to get speed (having a certain height), the bugfix was good and keeps the griffon in balance with the other mounts. 
---

You have to take screenshots now and then, else it's impossible.

...but then get lasered in the ass by a scepter weilding cancer inducing  condi "lol scepter 3 10k damage" mirage :/
---
You basically send the seller all the tradable materials to make the legendary, they make it for you since they cant give you the gifts, and send it back.
---
What, i thought all thiefs will now only run mainhand pistol for that 20% extra damage not having a offhand. 
---
Stealth on dodge from 3 to 1sec and no lead attack stacking. Lead attack fix might help but the stealth part is still obnoxious.
---
This is reddit, where braindead leftist zombies roam freely.
---
Naive question from a noob:   
---
I was wondering if you could combine the jumping capability of PoF mounts with the gliding wings you get from HoT, by changing from one to the other in mid-air.
---
Is this an example of this?
---
This opens a lot of new possibilities
---
The wave on cairn appears on 15%, but even the lower dps 10 man groups has enough damage for the boss to still be in a chain of queued attacks from previous percentages(most of Cairns attacks have long animations and since there are no phases they never cancel), so you need I'd say, more than 30 secs below 15% for it to trigger.
---
Jokes on you, I die every 10 seconds despite playing Chrono-OP-pls-nerf
---
That's literally everyone talking about GW2 since launch.
---
Yeah, avoiding the orb very close is still a miss. :)
---
Some of his conclusions are correct but his reasoning destroys any legit argument he tried (or not) to make.
---
I don't play a lot of PvP, but speculating I could see how it has less impact than people expect. 1 second is enough to get a deaths judgement etc off. So it should still be deadly.
---
In WvW it will hopefully mean that they don't permastealth any longer.
---
*FRACTURING THE COMMUNITY*  
---
What's amazing is at first it was okay, then the "NSP Council" (legit there is one) decided they didn't like it.
---
There's a mount skill called Bond of Faith available through the most recent Living Story episode. It fires you off your mount with some little crystal wings, which is what's happening here.
---
You can then, after a short delay, get your glider out, yeah. 
---
Yep! Gliding takes a while to be able to trigger, but you can glide after dismounting via Bond of Faith. Before this skill was introduced, you could mount a griffon in midair, but once on it, you were stuck on it.
---
You transferred over recently, didn't you?
---
Seconding this
---
Honestly, it was rather 50/50. Most folks who were anti-mount were thinking of mount systems in other games though, which ArenaNet pretty much completely avoided.
---
Sure. Human female meta ftw. https://imgur.com/J7ooKil
---
They're good in all modes, but not in healer or support roles. In PvE you're either Chronotank, the off-chronotank, or a DPS in Raids while in Fractals you're either DPS or boon bouncing. In PvP you could run a somewhat bunkerish build but your mainstay is harder than Firebrand as you're limited in heal and mitigation skills than Firebrand. In WvW it *can* take the place of a frontline boon sharer (more or less full minstrel with like Durability Runes or something) or as a backline one (using a mixed gearset) though WvW healer mesmer builds theoretically do exist still its not much worth since your mantras have better effects when used and let recharge (Mesmer mantras heal when you initially cast them, so you'd need to use all charges, let it cool down, then recast. At the end of that you heal in an AoE).
---
Oh, really looks nice! I like the mix&amp;match of the sets.
---
As a thief main this is what I worry about. The only thing thieves have are mobility and stealth (stealth just with deadeye). Not a good dueling class. It looks like both these advantages thieves have are getting nerfed through the mount addition and more stealth nerfs. Deadeye is a cheesy no skill grief build, so good riddance, but thief other then that is in a rough spot already. 
---
Core warrior when not in need of boonstrip, provides great CC. If your chrono agrees to boonstrip, you can run core all the way.
---
Maybe you can squeeze a core guard as dps. For t4 surely. THough dh has better dps of course.
---
Not sure about core ele, but also maybe.
---
Didn't play any other classes that much, but there might be other possibilities.
---
But elite specs mostly provide more dps and utility than core for pve content, so it's no surprise.
---
Guild siege does the same damage as Superior siege, with the exception of Guild Golem which is a Cheaper Alpha Golem (and not a cheaper Omega Golem).
---
Just this very basic fact make me completely distrust most of your guide (tbh the builds are not helping).
---
One of those weird things you shout out as you throw something, similar to yelling out "Kobe" as you throw (and often times miss) the shot. In retrospect "Yeet" is said when adding power to a throw, whereas "Kobe" for accuracy.
---
For Dwayna, The pale tree and batman, Where can I find an archive with gw2 memes like yours?!!?!
---
Most JPs block mounts and gliders though.
---
See one of the other replies to the comment you replied to. :)
---
Yeah mounts tend to be.
---
Kinda sad they don't have a collection, though.
---
The Dragonsblood Spear would be a perfect skin reward for it.
---
haha &lt;3
---
Honestly i played on and off alot and always rerolled and started from scratch. Makes me more invested in my new characters that way too.
---
They aren't required in the old maps by any stretch, but they make getting around in those maps miles easier. Old vantage points are now trivial to get thanks to Mr. Bunny and Mr. Bird.

Yay for banning Gatherbots and people who afk karma farm.. While the people who Teleport hack in wvw can keep going 
---

---
I'm gonna pay you 100 gold to fuck off.
---
(it's a meme, don't be offended, I'm sure you're a nice person) 
---
More to do in open world than any other game? *cough* wow, ff14, runescape *cough*
---
Ffs even bdo is more open worldy and has more shit to do... gw2 is not even open world. Its all instances and those instances don't really hold too many people. The biggest ones are like 200 people max (DS)
---
And yet there is a queue just when you are done with whatever you were doing in other modes. 
---
get in line, right behind world completion.
---
Teleport hackers are harder to catch
---
That's just another glitch we haven't found.
---
&gt; is it worth to start playing it now ( i want good pve and don't care about pvp) 
---
yes! it's free so try it out.
---
&gt; also can i complete pve without friends?
---
yes, all the story instances and almost all open world is solo-able
---
I'm going to go ahead and be that person by answering it's the opposite of "yoink"
---
Bik is a pleb 
---
Grats. It is an achievement. Got mine back when you needed WvW. It took a few months of logging in hoping for the right world control
---
whoa, i never know that!
---
I waited over 7 years until they finally changed the Drunkard title in GW1 to count the drinks on consumption instead time drunk.  
---
I also waited for ages until you no longer needed dead-leveling in pre-Searing ascalon to get to level 20, and even longer until you no longer needed a gate monkey to go to the north area alone.
---
Always worth it.
---
Lvl 80 scroll is a waste of money too.
---
1. since you want to go for a safe high dps variant bring Deadeyes with a bow on second set.  
---
this will provide high Boss dps and the possibility to get fast away if you get shackled
---
2. it's not rly about condi. Renegade is just the highest hitting dps class on a huge hitbox if we exclude rifle deadeye that just isn't consistent in a real scenario
---
3. there is not rly such thing as a safest composition. If you want an easier time you can leave 1 druid at the group all the time and bring a healscourge as kiter which allows pulling ppl out of the pools if necessary  
---
for the dps look at 1. just remember you allways need someone able to boonstrip
---
4. if you want to learn a Boss or a new strat that sometimes include bashing your head against a Boss for an evening or more. Giving it only 3-4 tries you might not make any progress at all and even if you make progress change and come back the mindset for the Boss will be gone and you have to start anew.  
---
If the amount of kills is more important to you than to kill a new Boss do the Bosses you know first and take ther rest of your time and bash your head against a Boss till it dies or run out of time,  
---
Seriously, go front to back to front, don’t sit still or go side to side and you will get them more reliably every time.
---
Scourge and shortbow soulbeast are incredible at Dhuum because they keep damage uptime going from range and each have self/group condi cleanse.
---
Renegade can hit 16k+ when played perfectly, but soulbeast can hit 14k and is under-represented at Dhuum. Scourge can break 12k and brings a bit of barrier to help people who stand in mechanics as they are learning. They also have the instant cast of F2 to help anyone who might have been on a crack and gets feared and lots of boon strip access.
---
To answer some of your other questions, 2 druid+heal/condi kiter necro is super safe.
---
I like to set a 2 hr max on a boss because I find less unsatisfying and more really useless as people become fatigued.
---
[The timing on what he's saying while the message is on screen is priceless](https://youtu.be/Ax-_06Acj8Y?t=1417)
---
Don’t sit still to let them pass through you, go front to back until they pop and you’ll get them every time
---
&gt;  Ergo, this would therefore mean that this is the boss where "More DPS = Safer Kill" applies the most as it 
---
I would argue that this is not actually the case, given that you're going to run into all the mechanics regardless, and they should go well if people can keep that up. If someone can confidently do 5 greens, that 6th green isn't going to be a problem in that regard.
---
I'd say that a boss like Gorseval is a better example of where more DPS is a safer kill, as when you are lacking in that regard, you have to switch up the flow to do a mechanic that people usually never do(using updrafts). Similarly, if people mess up statues during Keep Construct and you can't CC him to interupt him, you'll have to actually do the mechanic where you have to kill white/red adds before they explode; People never do that, so when they do have to do it they start to pancake and fail in doing so.
---
Basically, anywhere where improvisation is needed is usually doomed to fail in PUG runs
---
SC made builds/rotations that majority use as basic guide to class mechanics, so in sense all skilled players use SC rotations as basics for raiding on different classes.
---
I dont think ppl should be carried, i rather think those able to do raids playing mechanics good enough to pass raid boss (all 10 ppl in party , no leaching). 
---
On other side, those 0.1% , SCs, and other strong skilled raiders need to be rewarded for what they do. Speed run, CM runs, at lease, can be rewarded. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/1QquQ.jpg
---
As long as you don't make mechanics that instantly kill you due to some bs on server's end it's fine
---
I’ve always considered this to be Joe’s best review. It’s the only one that got me to buy somehting I otherwise would not have.
---
I'd believe you if you had any arguments in defense of your words, but right now it looks like a ff14 fanboy blindly hating the game. Don't be like that.
---
I'd prefer if they managed to set you in 'swimming mode' while outside water, so we could freely move up and down and aim better to where we go without also having to have skills to go up and down or scripted movements.
---
That would also allow having bodies of water above water level, which would mean we could have pools of water in the air. Imagine having orbs of floating water in a map, and having to traverse a chasm by jumping between them.
---
As a (raid)newbie joining a raiding guild, they for some reason used to practice Dhuum CM with me. I was given the task of doing orbs and its pretty much what killed my raiding enthusiasm. I have 200+ ping which is partly to blame but honestly it was the most inconsistent thing I've ever had to do. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. And the rest of the team pretty much just kept saying that it was normal and that each person had their own way of trying to make it work consistently. Bad mechanic IMO.

Man the game was so different back then. 
---
The way gw2 is now deserves brand new reviews.
---
The game's economy is surprisingly stable and one of the things that makes it so is TP fees. Removing them not only would be incredibly stupid but also a way to quickly inflate prices.
---
*woosh*
---
All classes are viable at some things, but your server’s success or failure rests on its ability to win 30-50 player zerg fights on Eternal Battlegrounds. Only a few specializations and builds are optimal for zerg fights. The meta up to this patch has been solidly dominated by squads composed of FB/FB/Hrd/Scg/Scg. You can re-use PvE gear for herald/scourge but Firebrands are usually running around in full Minstrel’s with Monk runes.
---
If you don't know anyone that WvWs, your best bet would be to find an open squad, check the the squad message, and join their Discord or Teamspeak server. You can also ask for your server's community voice comms and find a squad that way.
---
Warrior is masterclass. Easy to play. Hard to do it well. 
---
Try downloading the GW2 client, installing it to you SSD and letting it install for 5 minutes. 
---
After that, close it down and copy and paste the Gw2.dat file file from your HDD into your new Guild Wars 2 folder on your SSD and start the client again.
---
Even then, minus the 80 boost and the keys the rest of the stuff is worth 4000 gems and is still technically saving gems at full price and a decent deal at the discount. This package is really meant for newer players who will have a use for the boost and the gathering tools. Someone that's been playing a while and has a ton of 80 characters, 400 tomes gathering dust in their bank, and either uses karma gathering tools or bought some fancier  infinite gathering tools isn't going to have much use for this.

---
Isn’t it 3 stones? 
---
Because there is nothing more frustrating than getting underpid by one copper over and over again.
---
As an MMO, there is an in-game economy, which isn't stable if left alone. Especially when gold can be generated. That's like printing money and expecting everything to be the same price.
---
I agree its frustrating getting underbid by 1c. Really makes me wish sometimes that there is no listing fee so I can take down my item and relist at new price.
---
But here is the thing - If I can do it, so can 5k others who listed at same price as I did. So we all sit at TP and underbid each other by 1c untill we drive the price so low that its no longer profitable. And we keep underbiding to the point where we have no idea why we started.
---
You think I'm joking? I played WoW for 12 years and have 2 WoW accounts, one of which used to sit at the AH 24/7 scaning prices and delisting items where i was underbid so I can repost. Constantly. And it wasnt just me.
---
I cant claim all of the credit but I'm about 90% certain that I'm one of the handfull of people who are responsible for ruining WoW economy on my server (before the merge years ago) driving prices down to piss nothing and making gold worthless.
---
How? Easy. No listing fees.
---
I like listing fees. They are a commitment. I list item and pay a listing fee as insurance that I am intending to sell. Instead of just emptying my inventory by posting stacks of Iron Ore at 100g each and canceling when Im close to bank basically using TP as second storage.

Brilliant idea. Stand isolated to the sides so it's easier for perma stealth 15k malicious backstab deadeyes to pick you off.
---
Do you though?
---
Monsters eat/kill people and take their goods. You kill monsters and get that loot.
---
You take things to a merchant that buys them from you, and pays you for the stuff you sell them. Which they can take to someone else to sell. Just like any merchant.
---
Not too mention the obvious counter productivity of doing 3 dailies and making money or running a dungeon in 15 minutes to make gold easy.
---
If their way of taking money out of the game is the bltc, then people who don't post on bltc aren't giving much money back. In fact, the rate at which the player base gains money is higher than they lose it.
---
If anet wants to remove money, then they should offer things for gold that people want then they can remove it.
---
Me too
---
I'm only mentioning removing posting fees *if they do not sell*
---
Then drop it lower than they would be willing to lose?
---
Like literally the free market.
---
Vabbi:
---
HoT shoud keep you entertained for  2 months. PoF about 2 weeks.
---
Anyone knows when is PoF going on sale?
---
No, now kys
---
Among the reasons others mentioned, the listing fee exists to prevent people from using the TP as storage. Without a fee, anyone would be able to post items and materials at ludicrous prices with the knowledge that they won't sell and pull the listing when they want to retrieve the item.
---
True, it was just constructed so nicely and gave the game the respect it deserved, it also was the final push to me buying the game 1 and a half years later.
---
Why do so many people not like rangers?

---
Don't forget that these layoffs were not an ArenaNet's initiative, just a week before that, they've offered jobs for fired Blizzard employees. By looking at the revenue charts, previous year was the most successful year without major releases, yet the company faced such terrible fate. What i want to tell is, if ArenaNet thought that they could sustain themselves with that amount of money, while working on something else, but the big bosses didn't like that and decided to cut the corners, who really should be blamed for that?
---
Did you used to be on Dragonbrand before you transferred away?
---
It is just one tiny bit on how to remove money from the game. Consumables, soulbound items, expensive ascended/legendary items, anything that costs gold is part of it. Even waypointing. 
---
It also gives the coin its value. If there were no sinks, there would be no reasons to get gold in the first place.
---
It's a fine time to get into the game.   
---
Regarding which expansion, if you were to only get one you'd likely be disappointed. Heart of Thorns will give you gliding which is quite important/convenient to so much of the game now. Path of Fire will give you mounts which for the most part is not necessary for non-POF content, but you will be watching other players all around you flying and leaping big distances while you are confined to just running.
---
Tha k you! I know this will sound stupid but I don’t understand what 3:30 UTC-4 is in EST time :(
---
For the "Roller Racer"-achievments you need silver, for "Rolling Ace" you need gold. You can see the times for silver and gold at the start. While racing symbols in your buff list show, if you are still in time for gold/silver.
---
Fractal God is already a thing tho :\^) 
---
&gt; i don't see any reason why Deadeyes shouldn't be anymore
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; they only loose some amount of mobility while doing it
---
That part is, 100%, your opinion.
---
Nothing further to say, again take care.
---
3 questions.
---
What's the most common advice you give new players?
---
Which mastery do you think is most useful?
---
Which profession do you think is a bit too overpowered at the moment?
---
God of Pve: Everyone who plays chrono.
---
Now the thief can actually chase down on their mount go into stealth and pop them faster. I think OP isn't really looking at the whole picture. 
---
Why do people upvote this
---
That's because you aren't listing.. you are directly swapping goods for money..
---
Most of it is still valid. It just lacks Raids. If you are interested in those, you should also get HoT, which right now unlocks the biggest portion of them. 
---
Its also the quickest way to get hold of Ascended Armor.
---
Getting what you need for Raiding is the easy part. Do your spec collection for your weapon, get the Knight of Thorn quest done, if you still lack one and buy exotic stuff from the market. 
---
Now you can go three paths.
---
A) Try to pug (probably the worst way to start this)
---
B) Get into a Raid Training Guild like Crossroads (recommend this path)
---
C) Find a group of people (aka a guild) that wants to pick you up and raid with you
---
The progression in the expansions itself is pretty much tied to the main quest line through the unlocking of mastery points. 
---
The thing that is missing is the quest for your Griffon, a unique mount that costs a good amount of gold and a bit of time to unlock.
---
The guide also seems to only briefly touch Fractals. They are, in my opinion, much harder to get into than Raids. The rewards from not T4 Fractals are hardly worth it; It takes forever to reach T4 by just doing the dailys and T4s pretty much require a full ascended set of armor, trinkets and weapons to be playable. Its also not possible anymore to open T4s, or even look into the lfg of those, if you didnt reach Fractal Level 76. So even if you would have the equipment you need to play those, you still need someone to get you into T4 groups.
---
You also could start in accumulating Gold to buy the missing Living Story chapters. Especially the early ones from Season 3 allow you to get quite some nice ascended tinkets in no time.
---
The most important step of all of them is to find a cozy place that has the same roadmap as yourself. If it doesnt work out, dont hesitate to look for another one.
---
He thinks you're going off-topic by mentioning the lore reason for forest creatures having loot on them
---
Queensdale
---
My favourite is still his Dragon commander review. Fun game I never would have got otherwise.
---
That's the wrong takeaway. There are plenty of non-vertical progression oriented rewards that incentivize people to take part. How familiar are you with the game?
---
It's not clear from the description, but I am 90% sure you need silver on each one. 
---
Tropic Valley is probably the least forgiving with the time limit because it's quite long with a few sharp turns and places to go wrong. It took me fifteen attempts to get silver (which is fine because you need to do it fifteen times for the other part of the achievement). 
---
There are a couple of places where you can cut corners slightly. Going between the giant druid statue thing's legs shaves off a few seconds and remember you can get away with clipping the edge of the checkpoint bubble so you can get it while turning towards the next one. 
---
Queensdale wall isnt it?
---
cycling on them all is a pain but made collecting 33k wood for my sharur doable
---
Bay Keep, either Blue or Green Borderlands
---
Me too... got raid legendary armor and fractal omnipotion but mawdrey is too much work xD
---
These are hypotheticals and outliers; it will affect a small population from the average player and average economy.
---
These situations do occur, but it's in place to prevent the economy from running out of control from special interests (inflation, storage, flippers, bandwagons, inside knowledge, etc.).
---
I will answer as your post goes.
---
They will not remove it.
---
"Retrieve expensive items that have been driven down in price" they were high for a reason and they are low for a reason its someone fault for not watching over his items.
---
GW2 is amongst the best MMO economies out there and this particular fee isnt as bad as you portrait it. It serves clear purpose and thats as far as the topic goes really.
---
well this new patch, there will be a lot of skill lag by server(you press your skill and it does not activate...your pretty much dead!)
---
Anyway, on a normal day without skill lag, DD is perfect for roaming and zerging/blobbing for a lot of damage output and you have a lot of evades. Make sure to know your limits and know when to "kite" even in zergs(jump back into your zerg to manage cooldowns).
---
I always liked Skritt better anyway.
---
You are the best Commander I've run with. You just have a positive attitude all the time that makes everything about WvW feel better. I still have you on my friend list to remind me of better times.
---
In addition to the things others have mentioned, EotM originally died after Anet nerfed wvw exp and player experience rewards by 33%. K-trains were no longer worth players' time and everyone moved over to wvw proper. Now there's pips too, so there's virtually no reason to even enter EotM any more except for easy free access to the TP and vendors.
---
Today there will be a patch that will probably make wvw be permanently queued for at least a day, if not for a week or two. During this time you may see activity in EotM, but it will inevitably return to being completely abandoned once players have unlocked their new mount.
---
It might be a good time to unlock some EotM achievements if you care about AP, at least.
---
So you are admitting they did a poor job of implementing the system, haven't tried to fix it, and instead screw it up more.. lol
---
When gold should be in short supply, you shouldn't have things that cost thousands of gold.. that is kind of an oxymoron..
---
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE that's so cute!  :3 ♥
---
That is 3:30 AM EST (UTC-4 = EST). The wiki does its best to give you times in your time zone. 
---
the video has 5.3 million views.
---
Doesn't matter because DE is a trash spec, and rifle is a garbage weapon set, that thief did not need in the first place. It was literally added to appease the obnoxiously annoying vocal RPers from official forum - ANet said it themselves that this spec was added simply because "fans asked for it".
---
Therefore, no changes to it matters, because you can RP with it no matter how good or bad it is made.
---
The wiki normally chooses the right time zone for you - UTC-4 would be EDT, UTC-5 EST

---
You are assuming any game has instituted an economy properly..
---
And if no other game hasn't got a better economy doesn't mean that GW2 can't improve it's economy.
---
Just because people still do it doesn't mean it's not ok to prohibit it. 
---
See alcohol age drinking limit.

Ok? Like, that's awesome and I wish my stuff had ever been that popular but I am afraid that I am missing your point. 
---
Seems like he has burned himself out on the game so he decided to spew hate instead of just moving on after a fun ride.
---
That's not what I'm admitting at all., But you clearly have a bone to pick with Anet. So you do you.
---
But they aren't delivering a sale..
---
&gt; their economist isn't great
---
they havent had an economist for nearly 2 years now and even the two years before that, from 2015-17, John Smith`s position was Head of Analytics, not game economist anymore.
---
6 months.
---
No, but it could be when next LS episode becomes available or as a part of March sales.
---
Well then, even more not great.
---
The thief is arguably the best dueling class unless by dueling you mean spamming skills until one of us dies due to a lack of healing...
---
Mounts won't do much besides reducing easy pickings, can't one shot singles roaming anymore (even that could still be possible, just slightly harder). The thief's role in WvW stays the same (killing roamers+stragglers).
---
Drastically reduce them though, which was the point.
---
&gt;  They post a blue item for 10k gold and obviously nobody buys it because the item is trash.
---
but those items dont get listed for 10k gold because their owners are short on storage...
---
This is indeed Reddit, where everything has to be related to some political agenda.
---
In PvE and WvW gear matters. Like, a lot.
---
Around half of the game content takes place at level 80, where you'll want to work towards stronger, more specialised gear in term of stats. Generally, it's better to have the right stats than just higher tier gear. 
---
Some gear "prefixes" like Berserker's or Carrion offer stat combinations that are easy to get hold of, whereas some like Diviner's or Viper's require specific tasks to get hold of. 
---
You could try to run a full Carrion gear Mirage if you want, but if you want to increase your damage output, you'll want Viper's because that stat combination will result in higher DPS. 
---
Gear also matters a lot in WvW because you'll need more toughness and vitality as other players hit hard and hit often. 
---
There are also gear tiers with ascended gear being the strongest. 
---
In PvP, gear is standardised so you can just hop in, set your stats, build and weapons up and go. 
---
That's really not how 
---
I strongly disagree with this point. There are more reward options in GW2 than in FFXIV, because rewards are a constant in GW2. A glob of ectoplasm is rewarding now, and is rewarding 3 months from now and will always be rewarding. A piece of gear in FFXIV is rewarding once. It's rewarding today, but not tomorrow as I already have it. GW2 is *better* set up for this sort of reward structure, not worse.
---
This is basically the bot used on Fort Aspenwood TS.  I'm out of the loop lately on how much our copy has been modified from this.

---
looks like the wall of ebonhawke from an out of bounds perspective 
---
That is true, however, you did propose a solution on to improve guild wars 2's economy. So I'll give you my question again only will I rephrase it a bit differently so it makes a bit more sense. Can you give me an example to back this claim up where this solution has been put into practice and has worked out. 
---
DPS Herald and Scourge are pretty easy to gear up, and you can re-use existing PvE gear for it. Support Firebrand is the bread and butter for any zerg nowadays and if you're able to sink the gold for Minstrel's I highly recommend it. Even if you don't plan on playing with a guild it's still worth gearing properly and giving yourself (and your team) the best odds of winning a fight.
---
To expand on #2: if you go to the right past the heart vendor and around the right side of the tent, there's one dude to stealth past and then you can camp the flag behind that tent and just hit each cool down. Get the heart in about 5-10 minutes, every time.
---
That's the only point I'm going to agree with you here.
---
That video probably did more for GW2 publicity than all of ANETs advertising combined.

We've already seen fore-shadowing that Taimi is going to die.
---
The commander will use Rylock's sword to open a rift to mists and carry Taimi there, but not before she steals Phlunt's golemancy tool belt and Blish retrieves Scruffy's power pack. Together they rescue Gorrik, reviving him with Scruffy's power pack.
---
Now they just have to find Aurene in the Mists, and defeat Kralkatorrik. Easy, right?
---
Now give me a writing job! (and I work from home). 
---
Good, let Big Brother look. Maybe we can get more dedicated releases and worthwhile content than what we’ve been given the last two years.
---
I’m all for constructive feedback, but to imagine it would make a difference and ncsoft would act any different with regards of the feedback anet gets for some content that was fully ready to be live before anything happens does not make much sense. 
---
Ok here's my constructive feedback. 
---
Guys you forgot to put anything on sale today. Do character slots or infinite gathering tools please
---
That guy is a hypocrite and his reviews are untrustworthy. He has proven that many times. 
---
Personal skill makes the competition. If you beat an other player in PvP you are the better player and not just grinded the better equipment. If you kill a raidboss faster, your group is just better and don't have the newest raid set.
---
PvP is meant to be balanced around player skill and game sense, rather than player gear. 
---
So someone who is maxed out with the best gear can't just log into PvP and one shot auto attack someone who is running lower tier gear.
---
WvW on the other hand, people are not normalized by gear, so your actual output depends on what you bring with you.
---
Every time I complete that map, it's always the last thing I do because if i didn't, I would rage quit...
---
here is build page http://metabattle.com/wiki/MetaBattle_Wiki - while there may be some more "interesting" builds out there, its more then enough for start
---
BUT never forget you doing pvp - there are people better then you (if you starting, there is plenty of them). For example - I need around 300 games per class to feel good on it... and around 500+ to really know it - but still cant compare to people with thousends of matches on one class. 
---
So going pvp be ready for stupid and toxic people, some epic turn and return, some frustrated DC/regequits and other nice things from pvp anywhere :) But rewards are good ... and as i wrote -some games are really really fun :)

No one has tried. Most companies are hemmoraging money/employees these days. Mostly because they get stagnant because they want to suck out as much money without putting in more work than necessarily.
---
I propose a 6 month no sale money back guarantee.
---
If your item doesn't sell within 6 months, you get your listing fee back so you can try and sell again or keep the item or whatever.
---
So seeing as your F2P your best bet is to go Core S/D in PvP. You can view the build here [https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Thief\_-\_Marauder\_S/D](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Thief_-_Marauder_S/D)
---
Your job as a thief is to mainly decap far when you can quickly and it is left unguarded and to +1 and outnumber fights. Though S/D can duel certain professions decently. 
---
That is how you will have an impact, but thief honestly has one of the higher skill caps. 
---
People were toally freaking out and considering stopping to play because of simili-news, so ...
---
Blood ruby buff!
---
So true.
---
https://pastebin.com/ksQ0kec7
---
Thief has high mobility and dps. You should +1 as many encounters as possible and spike enemy's down. You should also decap unguarded points, whenever possible. Just look for a thief pvp guide in YouTube and practice your class.
---
Gw1 used a trade channel, but they could improve it and allow players to make trade part of the game/fun. Adds a hobby to it.

His/her misunderstanding of the changes was not sarcasm.

I’m still kinda miffed that they nerfed Renegade but only gave PVE Mirage a slap on the wrist.
---
Defiant Glass weapons huh? Waiting on Dulfy now lol

Really :D, its completely empty, and I formatted once I installed.

Sorry but that title sounds lame and probably entertains someone who has some insecurity. The only title that sounds cool but in the same vibe is God Walking Amongst Mere Mortals.

For normal people, yes. For gw2 subreddittors on the otherhand...

Let's hope not. Otherwise, i will end my life if they ban me for accepting 5g.

Well Armistice Bastion is a VIP Area.

Can't wait for those WvW queues with map chat full of people asking where to get the mount

Why wait on Dulfy when you can just preview the BL chest when the update hits?

The most important point made here was this:
---
When you set up LFG, make it known that you are new and wanting to learn the dungeons for the first time. Many people who regularly run dungeons are people farming the tokens as fast as possible, so their interests won't always mesh with yours. 
---
And if they think you know what you're doing, many will not want to wait for you to catch up or finish watching cutscenes
---

---
yeah we probably should have seen that coming
---
You take fall damage if you hit anything on the way down. For example, if you max bunny jump up a wall, fly up to try to reach a higher peak, tap the edge/wall, and then fall back down to the ground you will die.
---
yes I would like to learn to find fractals/dungeons and get some stuff that way. I glom on to groups when I see them acting up on a map, just tag along and watch... and score some loot. The aztec tequila named dragon guy was my first.

Also if Norn tattoos flower in the dark like Sylvari do, and if Tattoes were like birthmark on Norn, that'd get them some distinction from Humans. Ofcourse then there'd be no option to make Norns with no tattoes.

They fixed the missing texture problem yet with story mode npcs?

Aren't we all miffed?
---
&gt;until next game
---
Fixed *that* for you
---
I hope Anet adds a dialogue that directs player to get wvw mount when we talk to him. 
---
So, I agree with you for wanting the remove the RNG, but as someone who has defended the old way of doing it (but not downvoted people for that, jesus fucking christ) I think there is a good gameplay reasoning for having blood rubies be harder to come by. Blood ruby gear is semi-legendary in that it can have stats swapped really easily AND only using unbound magic. I don't really get why this change was made without changing the stat-swapping item to cost like 1 blood ruby. Maybe they think that it's old enough content that not as many people will be getting the gear?
---
Great summary.
---
Eh, sometimes the critique can be valid, some people can leave the game and ride the hate/critique train to call devs out for their incompetence, mostly when it comes to features and changes they become displeased with, but still wishing to return to the game after reverting/fixing these changes. (From personal experience, it's relatable to League of Legends)
---
Not in this video though.
---
How is DE rune a joke?
---
I agree on the RNG gathering bit. Better to just have fewer nodes with 100% chance drop.
---
sit around afk hoping something will attack you, never attack anything. Never content creator, always content consumer.
---
wow, damage control before actual damage, congrats
---
Is it actually confirmed that they will be? Is there a chance someone fucked up and confused a Cavalier Rune change with the Cavalier weapon skins coming back?

---
Instant Q on every single map.... &gt;&lt;
---
Same. I think this is an individual issue, not a game-wide one.
---
no serious company makes such decisions based on random shitstorm on forums, especially that western market for ncsoft is more like a whim, not serious business
---
For an example any scene involving Zojja is missing textures. Try doing Crucible of Eternity story mode or something similar with her. She and various other characters will appear as a white checkerboard. This has been a complaint going on since December I believe. Possibly earlier.
---
It's the checkered texture bug. They said they fixed it awhile ago, but it's still happening. The list of which characters would be too long to draft up / remember.
---
Seriously. The blood ruby items are still some of the best since they're stat-swappable, and I've been waiting for this change since they came out.
---
I already wasn't taking part anymore in that map. This is just.. lol
---
Thanks for the heads up, though.
---
Guess I'll pop back there to return my Istan scroll and Karmic Retro /jk
---
I play on 80 ping or so, and this mechanic along with things like orbs on KC cause me to go insane. This one is a bit more punishing though. Hit detection is horrible for these, and I hope they consider changing it to be more client side, if possible.
---
Good riddance.  Anyone watching the price movements of loot and materials before/after the recent nerf could tell that Istan farm was having a very wide and disproportionate effect on the ingame economy.

Can we get the regular ecto salvage rates on Elonian weapons restored now?

I honestly thought they were keeping the best as a surprise.

&gt;Stay informed on the shifting tides of battle with access to team chat and a detailed view of the WvW map. Traveling around this lounge is made easy with Mist-Step travel skills—simply use them to teleport to merchants or to quickly return to Tyria. But with amenities this great, we think you’ll stick around for a while.
---
Agreed. Istan is now ONE farm that you can do daily for pretty good rewards (I normally get like 14 gold from Pala using the magic to buy shipments?). It is/was borderline scummy to make the far and away best farm be locked behind a paywall, but no one complained because most people had Istan unlocked.
---
I knew I wasn't crazy. I see this often. Don't know why you're being downvoted. You're being honest.
---
Meta unbalanced? Better nerf the populated one and leave the deserted ones alone #justANetlogic
---
&gt; They post a blue item for 10k gold
---
Do you really think someone posted a blue item on the tp for 10k gold and paid the 5% listing fee to use the tp as storage for a item thats worth a silver?
---
ugh god lol
---
Yeah. TBH the map/reward system is great for the health of the game's economy in the long term because it lets players flood the market with certain materials if there's ever a deficiency, but the prominence of this farm led to everything being largely worthless.
---
Faster than superspeed combined with no in-combat movement reduction sounds problematic, even if the former is within owned territory.
---
It's gonna be interesting testing this out later today.
---
This would be the most satisfying way of doing it and likely encourage those that have a majority of the achievements, but not all, to finish them up. It would provide a little more content for people that clear weekly but don't necessarily care for things like the challenge mote on KC. 
---
I did that dungeon recently. It's also missing a shit ton of audiofiles.
---
Fair point.
---
Some special features with this lounge
---
* Access to WvW chat
---
* Special teleport ability you can use to quickly get around the major features of the hub (i.e. portals, vendors, banks, crafting, dueling area)
---
* Dueling area 
---
It really isn't a nerf. I mean if you dodge spam that is just bad gameplay. In normal gameplay this will be fine. 
---
* Runes labeled as granting "all stats" now include concentration and expertise among those stats.

Finished Aurora yesterday &lt;.&lt;
---
Finally the prices for Dreamthistle weapons will drop, at least I hope so. I've been meaning to get a few. 
---
And food :(
---
That's great but no point being in the notes if it's not in the fucking store
---
Still haven't fixed the fucked up character models in cutscenes I see
---
so from 24 champs down to 5? seems a bit harsh. 
---
Re-read your post, I only started looking into the guild API 1-2 years ago and I don't know whether the API always acted like that. Maybe it was limited at some point, or maybe people dropped less decorations back then and didn't drown treasury records.
---
Would it happen to send you back where you came from like ye olde mistlock?
---
[Finally](https://imgur.com/a/uM8rwFe)
---
right because its good for the game to kick everybody back to the fucking dark ages of money making where the only way to make gold was to run dungeons for silver. 
---
Istan was the one decent farm and now its dead. Back to silverwastes which has been done for years. Only to be nerfed again in a month.
---
&gt; We've been looking at ways to improve the pistol main-hand and dagger  off-hand build for thieves. We wanted to give the weapon pair a little  more lethality without improving other weapon sets or removing current  utility, so we decided to go with the mechanic we used for Tow Line  during the underwater update. This allows Shadow Strike to flip over to  Repeater for a period of time.  
---
arcdps needs to be updated almost every patch. delete the dll and download the newest version.
---
Doesn't effect me. Was a 50/50 shot due to the time I got to play and it was 0% after the first nerf, I don't think it can be any lower lol.
---
Rune of Surging gives 25% movement speed???????????
---
Disable arcdps.
---
Wait for an update.
---
Re-install arcdps.
---
Wow... warrior banner nerf? It is nerf right? I wonder if insta kill of downed players with banner will be OP in WvW.
---
Does the participation decay while in there?
---
You can't normally interrupt a jump from a PoF mount with a simple dismount, or dismount midair (annoying when you're on a gryphon, or falling to your poor raptor's death when you misjudged distance). The only way to do it is with the mastery Bond of Faith, from Living Story.
---
I see. Thank you for the explantation.
---
I used to give Rangers I grouped with 50 silver if they named their pets. Unfortunately, lately, not many seem to do so.
---
&gt; the one gemstore purchase I really regret
---
I really wish I could sell it back for.. anything, really. Statuettes, even. 
---
It'd be nice to have an exchange where we can put our gently-used Gem Store goods for others to buy. 
---
Oh man, those weapons being made of stained glass...I don't think I can pass those up... *Kingdom Hearts' Simple and Clean starts playing*
---
Thanks :)
---
you seem triggered. 
---
Sorry that in this case i just looked objective at the made statement RELEVEANT FOR WHEN IT WAS MADE instead of bending reallity as i see it fit.
---
Welp, that was fun... 
---
Anyone got an ingame screenshot of the scepter?  It looks intriguing.
---
I like how the comments are disabled on the video lol.
---
rolf,so it was rly all changes,wow. so after year of shiting on war,you just nerfed banners and called it a day. WOW
---
:(
---
Well it's just the LESSER Smit Condition but still...
---
https://www.smallindie.dev
---
Defiant weapon skins look pretty good. Now only if I had any will to actually play this game again.
---
Actually releasing a bunch of skins for just the new mount is refreshing compared to the beetle where they were interspersed in subsequent license sets. Hoping maybe 2000 for the set.
---
Thank you Dulfy, these weapons are gorgeous!
---
so SW farming is no longer Defend Events-&gt;Vinewrath-&gt;Chestfarm-&gt;Defend Events?
---
Kinda weird to only have this as a paid pass without an actual lobby...
---
Oh baby. (And yes my name checks out lol) 
---
I'd be fine with a reshuffle that reduces the numbers a tad to allow concentration &amp; expertise to be added to it. 
---
They could call it 'Cosmic' and make it timegated behind a combination of LS4 currencies (all Kralkatorrik related)
---
Well time to go farm blood rubies and forever forget about season 3 farming.
---
guess no mount for me
---
If you clear cripple, immobilize, and chilled, you are exhausted for 9 seconds. This happens very often even if you aren't spamming dodges, especially true in WvW, where these conditions come out of everything. As such, this is definitely a nerf even in normal gameplay.
---
Any word on what the AB location even is? Is it like a safe zone? 
---
exactly! i wouldn't go as far to saying \*virtual garbage\* per se as i do value "art" being produced by the devs in creativity and devotion as some might collect funko pops, racing cars, vintage artifacts, legos, list goes on.
---
however, i do share the sentiment that RNG from BLCs are \*virtual garbage\* as long as it's really not QoL. also, i think it's fair to say that we, the customers, deserve to be pampered/treated as a customer but only as much as we have "invested". 
---
sorry folks but your wasted hours do not count as invested if it doesn't provide monetary value to the devs, such is how the world revolves.
---
Bond of Vigor made it easier to skip JPs that restrict mounts even.
---
The border between Texas and Mexico?
---
to play effective in conquest you need to know what role your build is good at. that determines al your rotations. learning about roles and rotation strategies you can check this playlist. here i collected all pvp based guides no matter what youtube channel. and even the older ones will stlll have usefull tips: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLETdLrir8u0JjWqRxGAUUOTa6efPVSWyC
---
It all came down to shit since our lord and savior Joko died
---
Yes, but defend events consist of circling the map tagging the defense events in order or red, indigo, blue, amber.
---
That's some big intellect for sure. 
---
With all boons and all profession buffs you are vastly overbuffed and dealing more damage than you ever will in a real scenario.
---
In the mists, it is a safe zone with an arena
---
Once again, laughable QA.
---
That's what bond of Vigor is for.. have you not seen frostball do JP skips before?
---
It's like mistlock sanctuary for wvw 
---
I like that they are not all the same color and seem varied. That is really nice for a weapon set here. Though maybe we can get weapon dyes someday in my life. Maybe in GW3.
---
different colors on the same themed weapons looks wrong tho...
---
this is probaby one of those time where dyable weapons would be a very good thing
---
some of those are prettycool btw
---
its always a good time to restart gw2 :) it still has enough player (esp in pve), lot of new content and is still the best mmo out. also juts try it out, if you dont have fun , you can stop any time
---
[Here you go](https://imgur.com/a/juaCTWd)
---
Do you really think the lay-offs had anything to do with warclaw? that shit got released 2 days I think before the lay-offs. No company would ever think "bad dislike ratio, lets fire that many people in such a short time span"
---
They made the change last, last patch wherein participation freezes upon leaving wvw
---
That was the map where they made all the mistakes, IMO, regarding Map Currency Nodes:
---
* RNG Droprate  
---
* Same map icon as other mining nodes  
---
* More nodes than can be harvested; was annoying to have them 'blink off' for doing 'too many'.
---
That tempest support though, best solo support now. Time to have spirit-slaves instead of druids.
---
The cheetah one looks so weird. Like a stuffed roadkill
---
I think a lot if it can be in EOTM if you just a PvE scrub that wants the mount 🤣🤣
---
&gt;[&amp;AgHYXwEAAA==] 	Wyvern Roost Scepter Skin

So you're saying you already bought all the other lounge passes and have placed first in a monthly AT?

Unending Ocean. Full water combat expansion, GO!

since I also bought the game on the day it came out and I also want the 7y birthday gift early, in case you had it earlier, jealousy :P

That's not going to work if it's a Teamspeak bot tho.

I think it was a straw.

I've wanted to create a [H'aanit](https://octopathtraveler.fandom.com/wiki/H%27aanit) from Octopath Traveler vibe. She summons various beasts to help her fight (before they again disappear, kinda like mounts) though the only beast she can use that doesn't have limited uses is Linde, a large snow leopard companion she's had since childhood. I had a Norn I was considering re-rolling into a Ranger to give her a snow leopard pet (she's currently a Dragon Hunter), but with this Warclaw skin...don't really have to!
---
Spread out, yes; hard to get to, no. There's a set of "mist-step" skills you can use to teleport around the place.
---
don't forget blood ruby gear only offers HoT and core Tyria stats, so your healer or tank wanting harrier or minstrel is out of luck. 
---
&gt;  Exhaustion: This boon now stacks in duration up to 3 times.
---
Which "exhaustion" is that? Neither name nor description at https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Exhaustion sound like a "boon".
---
Queens dale 
---
how did you go so far? when i do it i plonk a few feet in front of me
---
Um, no mention of cavalier runes in patch notes. Does that imply we forgot they give 20% damage buff after dismounting?
---
Yer a wizard, Commander 
---
Cheerleading and moral support.
---
LMAO SAME!
---
This is what guild halls should have been. Anet, take note.
---
Depends on the size of your ssd.
---
The "nerf" portion is the reduction to +100 stats instead of +170 (and +200 for warrior with trait vs. +255). Otherwise I would say this change makes them easier to use. 
---
Was said in the warclaw reveal stream.
---
Definitely interesting. On one hand, having it move with the warrior is strong. On the other hand, counterplay stops warriors from diving the enemy zerg, dropping bubble and running out again 
---
This is a link to the thread discussing it https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/66831/suggestion-unhindered-combatant#latest the OG thread that suggested it in the first place.
---
I thought the same thing you did, but if that was the case then you could easily get up to 27 seconds of exhaustion which would essentially make the trait absolutely useless. 
---
I don't think they had any to begin with.
---
Even if any QA got fired (we don't really know afaik) they did after testing for the Warclaw would be done so...
---
The balance changes were announced on the forums about a week ago. 
---
Nah, I WvW fairly frequently. (I’m just not good at it) I probably will attempt EOTM tho. 
---
Really?!?! Many my guildmates use pots &amp; bug THIS!!! WE CANT OPEN WARCLAW, PPL WAITS PATCH &amp; NOTING!!!!
---
Champ Spawns are not 'once per day', but 'every encounter'.
---
To be clear there is a pass-locked lounge in Verdant Brink, Ember Bay, Gendarren Fields, Divinity's Reach, Fractals, PvP which can't be purchased(at least not in the gemstore...), and in Crystal Oasis. Either start saving up those gems or get comfy with not being able to go everywhere.
---
Nah, been playing WvW a lot more of late, just have adult obligations that get in the way of logging in until tonight when I'm sure the queues will be utter madness.
---
How is she so fast. 
---
10 keys and not even 1 uncommon drop - doing story and maps for them yes...but buying - never
---
Lmao insta aoe stomp is op af 
---
Been there, done that, don't miss it at all ;)
---
thats quite low compared to what I have seen on my guilds Discord :p
---
Maybe I'll just call out tomorrow so I can actually get this lol
---
Stay long enough to *kill* a few mobs and move on. And no, the bar progresses regardless of player activity. It progresses at a much faster rate when the events are completed.
---
Dittooooo
---
I definitely agree about build stuff (I wish I could manage my WvW build from outside WvW anyways though). That said, I do think the need for a WvW lobby is quite niche.
---
My question as I'm at work is: is the whole place a VIP lounge or is it a lobby with a VIP lounge section in it? Cuz I saw the dulfy video and the whole thing looks like the PvP lobby which has a VIP lounge...

Just tested out both wells with 100% BD, got 10 sec from each. You don´t have improved alacrity by any chance? (That made it 8seconds rounded up for me)

Wait, you can get to level 20 in pre-searing now without dead leveling?  How?
---
Can we just kill Kralk or put him to sleep like we did Jormag and Primordus next episode? I'm getting really sick of Fury of the Brand.
---
excuse me the staff would like a word with you

I do. But I often choose to ignore the joke because on the internet, its more often than not that people are serious while sounding joking, or third parties don't realize there's a joke.

---
&gt; It progresses at a much faster rate when the events are completed.
---
i'll be honest, I didn't know it kept going without players defending the bases.  I thought you needed all 4 secure to start the VW fight.
---
til.
---
5 players can kill a whole squad lol, would suck when you are fighting another side then mid-way you get ganked by a third side.
---
Looks buggy.
---
I've always liked the pirate one but yeah it can be rage quit inducing when it gets stuck.   To pass the time until diminishing returns kicks in, I just murder everything and hope for the best.
---
WTF?? Greathall is barely worth it after the daily chests now. That's so stupid. Why not buff other farms to be more in line with Istan instead? Oh yeah, can't have people getting more than around 20 gold per hour, that's too much.
---
"Hey guys, Balthazar's wanting to kill the Elder Dragons that'll destroy all of our followers. So I suggest we got to the guy wanting to kill us and give gim a power boost after we beat up Balthazar for him."
---
Only the Captain's Council is that stupid.
---
it was mostly tinting in GW1, and on a single part of each weapon while the bulk of it was undyeable tho.
---
Would have been great to have it on the GW2 level with multiple dye channels and the massive variety of dyes we have now. I understand why they chose not to, but I feel with a cosmetic endgame as their goal that it was a short sighted choice.
---
It's giving +1 warscore on engage.
---
I think the Obsidian Sanctum was sorta pushed in that direction last year.
---
Armor was largely the same as weapons for dying in gw1. That said, I agree.
---
Thank you for the prompt delivery, I don't know why since I'll be joining in 3 hours but seeing that huge queue made me laugh. XD
---
well you actually have nothing in the story suggesting it couldn't have happened
---
lmfao nerf incoming!
---
they're probably going to decrease the damage of the pounce and the amount of insta stomp we can do, maybe limiting it to 2? idk
---
That would screw up pvp and wvw roaming/duelling heavily though.
---
Perhaps a fix would be to have one nonranged heavy class to have an utility to put down a line field where if an ally would shoot through it, it would become unblockable. Necromancer would be the best fit for this imo. 
---
This idea would have counterplay (field is stationary, so you could run around it or move behind cover, forcing the opponent to move around the field or pursue you without unblockable projectiles) in small scale fights and be supportive in coordinated big scale fights. 
---
Please, that's basic. 
---
[Green was 102 btw.] (https://imgur.com/a/J5Z1sTY)
---
Atleast the skritt are more up front in their helplessness, they've been scattered and broken apart too much to be truly intelligent.   Also the skritt are hilarious (case in point their ship building skills).
---
I’m with ya brother. I’m a sucker for good shield.
---
Couple tiny changes that should've been done years ago and suddenly everyone in praising ANet again.
---
I'm laughing even more since i [bugged my collection](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/70467/warclaw-collection-blocking-issue/) and won't be able to obtain Warclaw for next however_long_it_would_take_them_to_fix_it ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
That and TotalBiscuits early look at the game, it was also really quite positive.
---
Istan wouldn't have been as profitable as it was with this mentality.
---
Have you considered how many ill-suited players are in WvW atm, instead of how many normally plays using meta builds?
---
There are people in greens and yellows in there (undoubtedly) and people in full zerk because they don't want a new set just to get the mount, etc.
---
NOTHING has really changed besides fights ending faster.
---
So you're an easy-to-trick fool who they can happily milk dry.
---
Well, seeing as the patch notes exist to document changes, it would have been nice if they had documented the changes.
---
In the real world there is a finite supply of “best” jobs so your analogy doesn’t really work. A farming method is infinite and so the best one is the one most will gravitate too with the consequences of inflation from that shift being felt by all who do not wish to participate because reasons. 
---
No more zerg yay!
---
There's a certain threshold the amount needs to pass for it to be considered suspicious. I doubt 5g breaks that threshold.
---
Boon corrupt - &gt; bubble gone
---
Does the "all stats" change apply to Celestial gear as well?
---
50 was my best case scenario. 😭
---
I do. You might be able to guess the 2 i'm currently using, Rocky and Big Smoke.
---
Can you change the rate of mistonium too please. RNG on nodes is a bit shit tbh
---
Damn.  Was hoping armor and weapons would be updated too.
---
I think his Anthem review was his best one yet.

At some point they some high level vanguard daily quests to pre-searing. https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Lieutenant_Langmar#Quests

Tasca's Theme
---
Do not forget the warclaw can detect too and everyone will have them (if they have PoF).
---
Also don't forget previous nerfs to stealth with marks.
---
Deadeyes (and thieves in general to a lesser amount) have been heavily nerfed and are at a grave disadvantage when fighting anyone with skill.
---
However, sadly, most players will celebrate that and would be completely fine with it being more nerfed.
---
oh, whoops. Brain fart. Yeah then it's mostly Harriers you can't get. I don't think any raid/pve builds use other HoT stats outside some weirdo builds like shaman/marshal heal scourge. 
---
Bit of a shame for WvW though, where a lot more PoF stat sets actually matter
---
The way he acted said enough. Youtube is full with vids that shows what i said. 
---
Copied wrong one. I’ve meant Tasca’s Theme. Try that one :)
---
Yes it does, stealth works normally.
---
Ouch. Well, at least you could try to live vicariously through others who are using the mounts to insta-down and kill everyone:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2njYC8grJUw&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
Late NA is kind of a dead time zone. Most groups you see running around are either NA prime guilds running past their raid times or pugmanders. I know of three late NA guilds that do still run regularly: Re on SBI, TLC on FA, and VII on CD.
---
that's a new level of toxicity.
---
So possible bug I found if you don’t unlock collection the items for it drop and can be used to gain tickets. At least the tail did for me possible way to exploit prop will be patched out. 
---
Bruh I can play only on weekends. 
---
Damn hopefully i don't play stealth snipe but stealth was my last card in combat :/
---
You are the best!  
---
Nice on an Ele, or maybe on Guard.
---
Thank you so much!  You are also the best!
---
:D
---
This feels unnecessary....
---
I quit years ago and I still know what RIBA is. Have fun doing laps again bois.
---
one more thing: this mount was delayed 3 weeks. very competent anet.
---
Its ok....better to wait for the hotfixes since no way this thing will be balances or have no bugs at release. 
---
These are locations on the wvw maps... 
---
This is pretty sad because I just made it there today with the goal of farming gold.
---
I started TODAY. HAHAHA  
---
I guess it do be like that sometimes.
---
Nothing.
---
Is this real life.
---
Minstrel is a HoT stat
---
As mentioned below, those are all things that should have been documented in the patch notes. Especially if they're given early for the explicit purpose of theorycrafting.
---
That aside, we'll have to see about their usefulness. They still have to compete with kits, after all. If they're not good enough to earn a spot, they're still as useful as before.
---
Do you know how fast champs die if 50 people focus them?
---
well, his wording was bad.. but he wasnt wrong

Gamers Rise Up

https://imgur.com/gallery/vVkoPPU
---
* After Sneak Gyro ends, the last pulse lasts another 12 seconds, so the total is 18. Not bad when you consider that you no longer have to pray for the gyro to not get stuck in terrain.
---
* 10 more seconds cd on Blast gyro is lame but now it pulses might and is now a mobile fire field.
---
* I admit, I do miss having the 15 sec of protection, 20 sec if I use the Medic Gyro toolbelt skill, but I guess changing it to barrier is more in line with the rest of the trait changes from the last patch.
---
 They also added a new effect to Bulwark that makes some damage from nearby allies transfer to you. That's a pretty interesting ability and I look forward to seeing builds that take that into consideration.
---
The rework isn't all bad, its just a bit different. The way you worded your post makes you look like a jackass though.
---
When? 2022, a week before they shut the game down?
---
Or just the fact that a swarm of 3k dismount attacks are pounding your raid.
---
From what I'm reading, I'm likely to get kicked as a ranger. Or put as low priority, which will probably impede on how fast I get the Warclaw. 
---
Some weapons were greatly affected by dye, like the colossal scimitar
---
These kinds of stuff are normally nerfed in the weeks after but sure whatever you dream of mate.
---
Another 'meh' black lion skin set.
---
Got these 7 vouchers just burnin a hole in my bank.
---
the running sound is awful
---
RNG only belongs on combat rolls and dex checks, not cosmetics. 
---
Well, there's certainly a lot to parse here, with some fairly major design shifts and new things to play with. To get the quick stuff out of the way first:
---
* Engineer/Gyros: The changes look solid, I just kind of wish you could relocate the AoE (just once) by reactivating the skill, where it makes sense at least. I'm also a bit unsure about how useful the new Bulwark Gyro will end up being, but that will require experimentation by people more qualified than me.
---
* Guardian: For pity's sake, ANet, just get it over with and buff True Shot back to it's original damage value in PvE. That aside, the Honored Staff buff looks solid, and nothing else jumps out at me as particularly notable one way or the other.
---
* Necromancer: All manner of tasty buffs, and Herald of Sorrow could be interesting (although it feels a bit out of place as a Master Trait). I approve.
---
* Revenant: The new Targeted Destruction has some potential, but I get the feeling that in a lot of cases it's going to be a net nerf, unless Power Rev has some way to maintain 20+ Vulnerability that I'm not aware of. Other stuff looks interesting, but not much that I can comment on.
---
* Thief: The new Shadow Strike functionality looks fun, I'll have to try it out later. I'm not sure what the point of buffing the standard version of Repeater was, unless said buffs apply to the temporary version as well, but bigger numbers are bigger numbers I suppose.
---
Now, on to the big things. First, Elementalist:
---
* Sand Squall: I must have overlooked this in the preview notes, because the changes actually make the skill almost as good as the newly-nerfed Signet of Inspiration, if not better in some areas. It has a longer cooldown, and Mesmer still has the advantage of recasting it with Mimic and Continuum Split, but the guaranteed Protection, Magnetic Aura and untraited 10-target cap make it a reasonably strong contender by my assessment. There's also the matter of Imbued Melodies, which now has more or less the same effect as the pre-nerf version of Illusionary Inspiration, albeit on a trigger the player can't control, meaning that Chrono has only about 3 seconds more bonus Boon duration per minute, give or take a bit (I haven't done the detailed math yet). I'm not opposed to the idea of other classes having ways to extend boons, in fact I think it's a good way to open up new support options, but if it ends up with a bunch of different specs having slightly different versions of SoI I don't think it's going to be the best for class and gameplay variety.
---
* Shout Stuff: Everything here seems quite reasonable to me, I'm all for other specs being more viable for filling support roles. Time will tell how it ends up impacting the meta.
---
* Weave Self: An interesting buff, I'm rather curious to see how it impacts the way people use Weaver, if at all. The spec has always had a bit of a durable bent to it, what with several sources of Barrier and the like, and it might be worthwhile to investigate leaning into this aspect a bit more for some builds.
---
Mesmer:
---
* Tides of Time: Another patch, another reduction in Alacrity output, albeit compensated by a bit of extra Quickness, but this isn't the place for another ramble on that particular topic. I'm not sure how I feel about it no longer trying to lead your position, but Chrono isn't generally super mobile anyway so it likely won't be an issue, and having it vanish into a wall or something less will be a welcome change.
---
* Assorted Cooldown Reductions: Always nice. The change to Well of Recall also helps offset the lost Alacrity from Tides of Time, which is appreciated, and Mimic could somewhat help make up for the nerfs to Signet of Inspiration.
---
* Mirage Cloak: Hmm. Objectively the change is perfectly reasonable, and I don't really play Mirage anyway so I'm not overly bothered by it, but it isn't exactly making me any more inclined to dig into the spec if you follow. I'm not sure how long this change will stick around, in PvE at least, but we'll see.
---
* Assorted PvP Nerfs: I'm no expert, but I get the impression that these were entirely warranted, so all good there.
---
* Signet of Inspiration: Ah, The main event. Practically speaking this nerf isn't a very big one - heck, it might actually work out to a net buff when you factor in the Mimic buff - but as previously stated, I'm not a fan of how it's basically the same skill as Sand Squall now. I wish there were a way to give each of them a distinct flavour, but I'm honestly not sure how to go about doing that. Something to work out for the next big patch, I suppose.
---
Ranger:
---
* Spirits: I rather like what they've done with this rework as it makes using them more engaging, and allows for repositioning and interesting interactions between them. At this point the only thing I would change, similar to my thoughts on Gyros, is making the active abilities ground-targeted rather than centered on the Ranger using them, allowing for them to be used for offence and support without the user having to be close to their intended target (which also encourages yet more stacking, something I would kill with fire if given the opportunity).
---
* Other Stuff: Seems fine to me.
---
Warrior:
---
* Banners: To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of this rework. It reminds me entirely too much of the starting zone overhauls, reducing the utility and possibilities of the skills for clever or creative players in favor of making them less confusing for... shall we say *newer* players. This comes with the unfortunate side-effect of turning them into glorified Turrets, another skill that recently lost flexibility in favor of simplicity. I'm all in favor of reducing complexity, particularly in a game with as many details and facets as GW2, but there seems to be something of a trend towards making things a bit *too* shallow in some areas when some slightly different solutions could have been much more interesting and rewarding to play. Having Battle Standard act as a finisher is a step in the right direction, but the rest are just sort of *present*, and I feel like there's a lot of unused potential there.
---
* Winds of Disenchantment: This is probably fair, particularly for WvW, but I get the impression it will make the skill largely useless in solo play. Hopefully they'll find a balance that's a better compromise eventually.
---
* Inspiring Battle Standard/Doubled Standards: Now this, I actually approve of. Making the baseline Banners weaker than before but the Traited ones stronger (albeit still a slight net loss) is just the way to adjust balance for skills like these.
---
Warclaw: yeah, I'm not even going to *consider* commenting on this just yet. It looks cool, and I really want to try it out, but I don't know anywhere even remotely close to enough about WvW to comment on the balance or how it will impact the meta. I just hope that the mode gets the attention it needs to become more popular over the coming months and years, in whatever form that may take. A solid patch overall, by my assessment; here's hoping it's a sign of things to come for the rest of 2019.
---
Wyverns are two-legged while dragons are four-legged.
---
A single misfire in your rotation can have a huge effect on your overall golem number. So yeah, just keep practicing. 
---
Also understand that the golem is 'in a vacuum' so to speak. Your in-fight numbers won't be that high. 70% of benchmark is also a good bit better than the vast majority of PUGs in raids. 
---
Never said he did, the problem was he made promises, Ditched for months, took holidays, came back with shit content and expected people to not care. He was literally a reaction channel. 
---
He built a brand and a youtube channel and then said fuck you. 
---
They are fixing it, no need to backlog them with your individual issue.
---
I always wait few days before doing anything new Anet release ^^
---
If NcSoft has its way expect alot more to be nerfed in order to push players to the cash shop. 
---
She makes me ctrl t her and say "inspector ellen kiel we are saved"
---
I do already. 25% crit drop effectively kills core guard. There is no reason to take guard over any of the other melee dps classes now. Soulbeast, war, holosmith, and rev are all better than core guard now. Especially hard hitting considering hammer guard got nerfed hard last patch. 
---
Actually my main is mesmer. My holosmith is my alt which I have posted at a flax farm
---
I'm sorry, *how many* GB? Do they make you download the entire game fresh each patch or something? That's just sad.
---
Sneak gyro is actually 18 sec of stealth over a few pulses. Plus, now it's a smoke field for even more stealth with no more annoying gyro that gives away your position / doesn't keep up.
---
Blast gyro now gives a fair amount of might, is a blast + fire field ^((fire field not shown in tool tip)), and is also now completely unblockable (the detonation was previously blockable, just not the 'tag'). Plus, the new PBAoE style pairs well with scrapper's melee brawl theme. Overall, I think it's a decent change.
---
Bulwark is going to probably be a little weaker as an ally support, but I think it will still be worth the slot. Though I'm not sure how the "take some of your allies' damage" bit will effect gameplay; it's a cool idea though.
---
Salty people today lol.
---
one of them puts TW in a 180s cooldown, the other one doesn't
---
This comes close but I still believe his Rome Total War 2 review was his absolute best and funniest.
---
That was DD only damage mitigation as thief is bandits defence and if it is 9 seconds of exhaust i honestly think other classes will take its role as decap hell mirage could do it and 1v1.
---
This arena is good for 1vs1 i doubt it is big enough for anything else.
---
Just because someone states a factual situation as is, which contradicts what you prefer or want, does not mean they are "sucking anets dick for no reason".
---
I don't expect you to be able to comprehend that fact though, with your childlike mentality.
---
i appreciate your candor
---
Didn't know that.  Fair, then!
---
Ya. I realized I didn't want to bash the game because I respect what the devs are doing xD
---
A Weaver can cleanse on sword as well. Sword water 5 should do the job. 
---
trains are a great pastime though, nothing else really keeps me playing this game like a good meta train
---
it wasn't
---
It's a bug caused by the maps bloodlust, hotfix in the work, soon to be patched.
---
\^ from ben
---
If it gets us more content, I'm not complaining. It will be impossible to quantify if the money from Warclaw skins and this instance will improve WvW directly, but at least WvW players could contribute a bit more to Anet with stuff that benefits them specifically, and maybe that will make WvW seem more desirable to Anet.  
---
Honestly, we're probably (from my very distant point of view) going to see more monetization across the board after the layoffs settle down. So long as it isn't p2w garbage, I'm relatively ok with it if the game continues giving us good content.
---
[The Sequel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mPyTq8PSHc)
---
Same!!
---
Not on a mass scale. They would need a test server for that but that cost money and resources they might not have. I do expect that there will be some patches to adjust the warclaw as more data comes in on how players are using it. Sadly that is the nature of a lot of online game. The devs can test it as much as the want but once it goes out to thousands of players is when the real issues show themselves.
---
Same here, 2 week pass, guess mistlock is completely empty now 
---
Not liking the changes. Napalm + Shredder Gyro was a powerful ground targeted AoE combo, similar to pre-nerf Meteor Shower.  Now you have to stand in the napalm fire field to get it to work, and it doesn't last as long, so basically useless.  I liked the old Blast Gyro, too.  You didn't have to be in melee range to get the big CC.  
---
which was again, just two streaks down the middle of it. A single channel, you couldn't dye the blade or the bulk of the handle, which was my point.
---
Not saying the dyes weren't noticeable, was saying they were fairly limited.
---
I use Teamviewer at home and will be doing this myself
---
Not super sustainable though. With 100% boon duration the blast gyro might stacks are 16s.
---
You guys need  to watch closely :) Wherever you see a +1 pop up the enemies are still standing, only where you see a +2 someone was finished off. Something's bugged obviously but it doesn't seem to be the damage at least.
---
Remember those recent layoffs? Anet needs to pump alot of money now to statisfy NCSoft. Easiest way besides pushing out new mount skins and blacklions chests skins with each patch is to nerf every profitable all gold farms. If players are unable to farm a resonable amount of gold, they will just end up buying gems and convert them to gold. RIBA is getting nerfed next patch, mark my words. So better enjoy it while it lasts!
---
tested by the same team that's working on the build templates
---
Only if he gets to bring his buddy Maxnar Warhorns. 
---
Those two wouldn’t know what to do without each other. 
---
yep but got to remember guys all the WvW players who called out this shit know nothing about their game mode and should shut up and be happy their getting something they never wanted in first place according to rest of the playerbase.
---
just nice though seeing that PvE is getting fucked by huge farming nerfs so the PvE players salty tears will join WvW tears. i would mention Spvp tears but they dried up years ago along with its playerbase
---
Just talked to my husband. He already has his and I'm babysitting until who knows when. 😭😭😭
---
Ahahahahahaha I bet this wasn't intended at all. Would make Druid into easy mode. I didn't even think that the spirits would be affected by heals when their health decayed slowly. If that's intended, cool change! Otherwise I don't see this staying around for too long.
---
It's not a GvG arena brah, just a small scale dueling.
---
Same here actually.  
---
One of the Holo heal skills (think it's the turret) is a 5 Target Condi cleanse when you explode it.
---
Ya, they stopped bothering to update raid builds and teh site just links to dT now. [Snowcrows](https://snowcrows.com) has taken over where qtfy left off.
---
That requires you to go out of your way from your rotation true also as Weaver is very powerful on Dhuum as you can Mistform to your soul.
---
it actually looks like the engage skill gives +1 points for tagging an enemy. 
---
I feel like the Guardian changes are going to be pretty big.  Nerfing the crit chance for Retaliation on Radience (Reightous Instincts) is huge, and the buff to Perfect Inscriptions makes that a much more interesting option.  Benefiting from the stat share upon activating the signet is...really nice.
---
Is it just me or do these weapons have a God/Aurene theme?
---
So does the revenant change put them more like a chrono in fractals? A huge part of feeling inadequate is that it lacks quickness.
---
Does the time stack with boon duration on swapping to shiro as well as the additional time?
---
Like with 100% duration do you get 4 seconds of quickness and 2s per target hit? That would be 14s of quickness on like a 20s overall cooldown, which seems like a huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge buff since rev is so reliant on quickness.
---
Would be nice to just fill a power dps support role like a chrono instead of the weird utility of revenant.
---
Both.
---
200k is a pretty small amount, you should just save it for now if you're not sure what to do with it. Large amounts of it can be used all at once in buying some items so it's a good idea to have a lot on hand.
---
Uh, I had a black one and a white one, the entire weapon was dyed, it wasn't just a streak or 2
---
Same with the aureate aegis. There were a few others that dyed really well as well, but those 2 I used most often because of how well they took dyes, well that and the scimitar was huge lol
---
It's a confirmed bug, the pass should be disabled for the time being (at least the 2 week one is, dunno about the permanent pass) - https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/70488/mistlock-sanctuary-passkey-2-weeks-temporarily-disabled/
---
Finally I can fulfil my life long dream to be a stained glass window &lt;3
---
You get one for "updoot".
---
Check out the builds and guides on [vabbi](http://builds.vabbi.org)'s site for ideas on gearing and how to play them.
---
Mistlock is still the best since you can zone into everything any other lounge can, except ou can also zone directly into fractals without having to first load up LA. I don’t see how another lounge can top this unless you can do something like zone into a raid zone without having to load the aero dome. 
---
Scourge with sand portal easily breaks the shackles. 
---
If you're negative enough you're bound to be right sometimes. No one thought Anet would let it be this broken, a lot of us thought they'd have sense not to make it too strong.
---
Stay mad though?
---
Did Istan really need another nerf? They have no issue with the SW farm and yet Istan gets nerfed time and time again. 
---
i farted while reading this. thanks. 
---
Because they cost money. They need to pay for the server space that can handle all of the data and handle all of the players. That all cost money so they have to decide if it is worth taking the resources out of another department just so they can afford getting test servers. It sucks and I wish they had test servers but not all companies can do that.
---
I spent 1.5k on the exalted shoulders. 
---
I didn’t get the drop. Quit for like a month. 
---
Mount is currently bugged where any dismount instantly gives +1 to warscore, those are not finished players 
---
(its still strong tho i agree)
---
But now we can do laps... on mounts!
---
Okay, what about the past. Can you give me one game ever made that has tried it?
---
&gt; There is one final buff worth noting and that it's now a Smoke Field. Meaning you can spam blinds with it pretty well when combined with Projectiles.
---
The Smoke Field's pretty great. Hammer 2 and Shredder Gyro both have multiple Whirl Finishers for rapid blinds, and Hammer 3 can Leap twice for more stealth.
---
I know, it's shitty, but obviously the current monetization mechanisms aren't working, otherwise there would have been better quarterly results and NCsoft wouldn't have fired a quarter of the staff. 
---
FYI, you can finish the silver wastes reward track and open the end chest. For some reason you get the warclaw item from there too.
---
Where is the "Free" part?
---
yeah, like epi got nerfed immediatly when it was completely broken in wvw. Or boonshare. Or rev hammer 2. Or chill reaper through a buff that explicitly stated "only pve". Or ghost thief... I could go on, but Its usually at least  half a year until its (maybe) fixed. 
---
In stark contrast ESO is aiming to increase its players enjoyment by offering a bonus drop event in some of their zones :
---
https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/55819
---
I love GW2, but when I see competitors doing player-focused events I start to consider dropping GW2. 
---
Instakilling? really?
---
I disagree oon the rotation part tbh. SS are fixed in time so you know whan to switch to water. Like 1 or 2 s b4 SS is enough to swap your main attunement back to air and have water 5 in place.
---
To expect QA to find every potential bug is unrealistic. Some bugs don't manifest at all until put under load.... and even then sometimes only manifest when in production. Speaking from experiencing many a frustrating release bugs and trying to figure out what the hell caused them.
---
One addendum to the OP, I had to spend a point and also actually enter wvw before the achievement was unlocked.
---
Just see this patch for what it is. A shameless cash grab. New lobby in wvw for 1k gems. New mounts in WvW so that WvW people have more incentive to buy shit mount skins from the gem store. How long till you scummy fucks put the game in maintenance mode like gw1?

People like insta death wvw week, but cry now. Seems like just a reason to hate on anet .

---
Wouldn't be surprised if they added a mount renter with no skills but allows people to keep up.
---
Sounds like someone wants to get rid of his collection. Also it's not free.
---
While this is true, there's a reason dropping patch notes a week early is generally not done (as a rule).... because in modern development, the Changelog/patch notes aren't usually finalized until the full release time. Wiggle room is left to allow for bug fixes and other patches found in any testing prior to release.
---
I can't speak for ANet practices, but in Vox Pupuli (A Open Source community for Puppet) we only generate a changelog on release, no matter how much code goes into a public repo, that Changelog doesn't get generated until the release is created.
---
Fuck off with your rationality. The sky is falling. WvW ded, Anet no care, gg
---
If you have a Druid, you can staff 3 onto the ledge for the Blue Catmander.

For your information, most experienced pve players have at least full exotic if not all ascended as they are usually the player base with the most gold.

Sadly, I only collect swords, I hate RNG and is my most fervent gripe with gw2.

All of these locked behind motherfucking black lion keys.

You can't do armors for in-game but you can shit weapon skins and outfits out the ass for the motherfucking gem store !!!

Yes, I know you can convert gold to gems, that is NOT the motherfucking point !!!

Consider stat swapping your set of legendary armor to Minstrel's and moving it to a Tempest. We're probably going to see a resurgence in support d/w or staff ele with the buff to shouts.
---
Sort of, yes, but right now this is like crashing the Moon into the Earth when you actually just wanted to throw a rock. Its waaay overdone.
---
Same. I entered any WvW zone for it to give me the emblem.

Supposedly warclaw was approved for release a month ago, typical anet lack of testing.

I'm pretty upset, Istan was my jam.

Guess I'll go and do some RIBA, maybe I can get my helmet in PvE . . .
---
I love the Defiant weapon skins. That shield is beautiful. 
---
Interestingly the weapons are glass/crystal but they look very thorny or planty and they look like they will go really well with Sylvari of all types. That bow is frikkin huge and it looks better then Kudzu. I love the Axe and the Swords as well. I even like how large the scepter is. That shield though is so gorgeous. 
---
There are so many vibrant colors, pinks, greens, whites etc....makes them look like stained glass or glass thorns....these are going to be perfect for Salads and anyone in TINY and meta human sideboob/undertboob mesmers. 
---
Well done Anet. This a gorgeous weapon set. Thank you! Hope the next set is just as good!
---
The glider is pretty slick as well!
---
Because all wvw players are a single hivemind that shares your opinions 🤔
---
And the problem is due to a bugged interaction with bloodlust, thus is not the intended behaviour of the mount.
---
Where is insta killing? I thought it read you can finish a downed player, which you can do by tapping F or just attacking them...? 
---
Yeah but it's still usually Zerker.
---
I was a little worried about the change when i saw the pre-release post insist Gyro's were "potent" even though they'd have been shitty even without the drawbacks they had. Not really had a chance to really check the changes out so far but they still don't seem all that great.
---
Investment on cavalier skin: 
---
Buy order: ~180g  - have to constantly outbid other buyers

Sell order: ~240g  - instant
---
Return on 7 defiant glass skin (after 15% tp tax)
---
Instant sell: ~250g - get money instantly
---
Sell order: ~280g - not that much difference and risk getting undercut
---
a 12+ button mouse by razer
---
And they're still wondering why they are about to go broke? 
---
With Belgium's law against lootboxes in games, maybe they thought they needed a contigency plan. Also I think more exclusive WvW content and rewards are good for the game mode, even if it is in the gemstore 
---
Nobody has told anyone that, that's just speculation generated within the echo chamber of this subreddit. Feel free to find a source - the closest you'll find is that ArenaNet were working on "side-projects". Keep in mind that things like Super Adventure Box  and Roller Beetle Races are side-projects - NCSoft isn't going off and puchasing a completely different engine for these "side-projects".
---
Obviously they won't continue working on the side-projects that were already cancelled, but as far as we know, there is no official or even a leaked source regarding what they will continue to work or not, but I would assume that what you suggest will certainly happen. To offset the staff reduction, ArenaNet will have to focus ls LS and expansion content and less on the sort of side-projects that gave Guild Wars 2 another part of its personality.
---
It's very telling what some people are saying NCSoft will do when in fact they've remained completely silent in contrast. What we have been told, and quite literally by NCSoft, is that they have an issue with "the operating costs in the Wests". Then there's the graphs, which speak for themselves,
---
Happy day-after-your-6th-cakeday!
---
If you want to comparison shop builds now, I'd look at metabattle, Discretize,  and SC. Some places will have different standards for stuff like potions et al but still worth looking at.
---
I did say mixed bag. I don't just mean seeing dumb spam while in the lounge, I also meant trolls not doing anything having more opportunity to derail the most useful channel in WvW. On the upside it means people can cut a break short to respond to a map emergency without abandoning another map. It's unlikely there'd be enough in the lounge to make a difference, but still it's an upside for smaller scale cries for help.
---
It's way cheaper to let your users *be the QA team*. Many companies are migrating to this business model.
---
More coordination instead of place and forget is always a great change. There's too many braindead pve builds since PoF.
---
I did see that thread just a little bit ago. It’s partly what sparked my curiosity, actually.
---
Does this effectively equate to “get Warclaw or go home?” The way I see it, overall WvW pace is about to accelerate. It would seem that in a game mode where sticking with your Zerg is critical, not being able to keep up could be detrimental.
---
That's a bit... Harsh.
---
Why do you say that?
---

why not farm lvl 96?
---
&gt; No?
---
no.
---
&gt; Give it a month
---
i'd give it a few hours at most, if i were up to me. a 10-target autostomp is absurd. the engage skill should do no damage to players (npc damage only), cause cripple against unmounted players, and auto-dismount mounted players instead.
---
Am I just seeing things, or does this reference Pharus, design wise? 
---
And no, I am not just talking about the light wings. 
---
still in that bloody queue
---
These things are priceless if you play chrono. 
---
This is something that I think would be really useful! The only benefit it would give to players who can’t otherwise access the mount would be allowing them to keep up with a zerg. It would keep the game mode playable for everyone while only allowing people who have earned the mount to use its skills.
---
Praise Kormirsura! 
---
This is no different then the old Facebook status of "Hey I am mad but don't ask me."
---
Oh my gosh, this is amazing. *saves*
---
do you have melee attack assist on

Nuke'm from orbit. It's the only way to be sure.
---
While I have my own thoughts on loot boxes (I don't have a problem with the GW2 loot boxes as to me P2W is purely defined as giving a mechanical advantage to payers over non-payers - fashion doesn't matter), GW2 didn't do horribly last year.   
---
They made $71.2 million USD. My big problem with the current state of the Games industry (really it effects the economy all over the globe) is how Boards/Investors/Shareholders/VCs have turned everything into being "Growth-based". No longer is it good to be making a ton of money over your costs, but what you make has to be exponentially more the next quarter/year or it's considered a failure.
---
Look at the Activision/Blizzard layoffs. The company had their most profitable year ever, but those in charge at the business level (I.E. Higher than the CEO) determined that the year was still a failure as it didn't meet the expectations set. This will continue to negatively affect the Games industry (as well as other industries) in the coming years.... and is also why I feel I enjoy AA and Indie games far more than most AAA games nowadays.
---
Is it possible to be this insensitive?
---
Most likely a wvw player who's salty about all the pve players feeding on their server.
---
Omegafuckinglul
---
Absolutly agree, sadly you'll get downvoted, people refuse to see it.
---
Every patch is a gemstore  / black lion chest update, and it has been for over a year.
---
No build save, no guild vs guild, absolutly terrible pvp meta/balance.
---
But hey, here's a broken (litterally) mount to fuck your WvW. Btw, dont forget to buy our new pass for 1000 gems, it has an exclusive pvp arena :)
---
Cedarpaw.5846 - I'll be home and online in an hour.
---
so aoe instant kill for 10 players on skill 1 is better than playing the actual classes.
---
please don't give balancing suggestions
---
Oh so this was their plan, WvW was one of the only things that wasn't expansion tempting, and I guess this fixes that.
---
We are talking about people in training/discovery of Dhuum so they may not all be reacting fast enough and watching timer (which is why I talked about going out of your rotation). That may not apply to everybody in all situations but it is still less straightforward than using F2 on DH or Signet of Agility of DD/DE for example.
---
&gt; Does this effectively equate to “get Warclaw or go home?”
---
basically yes. as it currently stands, the warclaw might make you impossible to catch (even for players with the mount, since they have to dismount in order to hit you, and you just run away with your mount while they're stuck on foot).
---
it also basically breaks large group fights, since 10-15 warclaws using their engage skills at the same time can delete groups in a split second, due to the auto-stomp ability on its engage skill.
---
i predict the warclaw will soon be nerfed, but i don't know what form those nerfs will come. anet has always been especially out of touch when it comes to WvW, so i won't be surprised if the eventual nerfs miss the mark, just like how the warclaw misses the mark.
---
Because instead of making a new mount they should focus on fixing WvW and the dead servers some of us are stuck in. Sorry but I am not going to pay Anet 1800 gems every time everyone decides to leave a server to the point where WvW is unplayable.
---
Also was there anyone actually happy with the class changes? Why do they keep nerfing stuff noone asked them to?
---
Yeah this literally just happened to me, I had 100 points to go for the Silverwastes reward track in WvW so I finished that off then started on the Warclaw one - then noticed I had the Warclaw Armour box instead of the Carapace one...
---
And I used it before reading the other post about not doing so before unlocking the collection haha. Oh well, I'm sure they'll fix it.
---
The team in charge of the Mount animations are honestly some of the most talented animators I've seen in games. Rarely do I find myself smirking at the way a creature moves or idles in a game like GW2 mounts have. They're so quirky and full of character. 
---
Ah, thanks for this information.
---
Take the mount HP down to 1/3rd, allow mounts to be CC'd. Remove stomping skill. Decrease speed in friendly territory by at least 10%.  Remove an evade charge. Then it might look slightly balanced. Mounts should primarily be for transport, not as giant balance breakers for combat. 
---
That said, mounts will never be balanced because it removes all need for mobility on engage.
---
Pretty sure this is part of marketing...if you look back he interviewed ANET and did play through sessions with them. People like this don't just show up. But, imagine if they did. YO, I'M ANGRY JOE DON'T YOU KNOW WHO I AM (banging on the ANET doors)? Yup, you're some angry dude...don't worry we called the cops to help you out. They'll be here shortly.
---
80+ on all maps. Whole day at work and when I finally get home, I can do nada. Well done. I bet its going to be like this whole week. Been playing this game for a year just because of WvW, with quite a bit of regular investment. But if the only thing I get during the week are infinite queues, I am out, because what use is a game that you can't play.
---
I'll be happy when they unnerf istan
---
They have a god theme, the torch is clearly inspired by Grenth, while the shield is referencing Balthazar with the wolf/hound face. (The Avatar outfit has these, too.) 
---
They hinted at the gods on twitter before the layoffs interrupted the tweets. This weapon set is yet another step. 
---
At this point, I kind of believe we are getting some really juicy god related stuff in the next living world episode. Not just in a raid, but actual god involvement in main story and new map. 
---
I've been hoping episode 6 would end with a bang, some amazing reveal/cliffhanger (I was hoping for Lyssa), and I am allowing myself to hope for a bang even more now!
---
Test a new feature - Fire the QA team
---
Choose one 
---
So I guess picking the tail of a zerg is no longer a strategy at all?  I mean all they would have to do is turn once and engage and your 5 man group is toast.  
---
Seems so, a guildmate of mine has the permanent one and his one is working too.
---
Yeah i was pretty anti mount because in other games theyre so floaty and awkward feeling. I didnt want that in GW2 cause the movement felt so good and fluid. Plus we had WPs everywhere. What we got for mounts blew me away and were everything i would want from mounts. Id rather have something implemented really well than something tacked on cause “well other mmos have them”
---
Then go see a doctor.
---
Go 1v10 on the mount and tell me how that works out for you with that kind of logic.
---
thx for the math, did mine with mostly buy orders, but after 10 mins half the weapons got sold to me already so i instabought the rest.
---
And it will be when they patch it.
---
*shrug*
---
how do you even get that one to unlock, i happen to be sat in a box next to the blue catmander and got nothing
---
Do you actually know what a reskin is? Because no, these textures aren't re-used from other weapons, if anywhere. 
---
The Shattered Cathedral glider is similar, but what else? 
---
&gt;A shameless cash grab. New lobby in wvw for 1k gems. New mounts in WvW so that WvW people have more incentive to buy shit mount skins from the gem store. 
---
Looks like this guy wants more layoffs...
---
Well based on what I know, I agree with you there in that they may not be the best for the game mode. From the little that I’ve played (enough for a few gifts of battle and that’s it), the pacing felt fine as-was. Maybe a little slow? But that could also just be due to my own WvW inexperience.
---
The way I think about it is more as a “mitigate damages” thing. To my eyes, a rental service would at least take care of the movement speed differences between members of the same zerg. Even though rental users couldn’t have skills, they would at least be able to keep up.
---
Do you stand too far from the wall? Even without healer, you shouldn’t be dead.
---
Was thinking of buying it, then I remembered I had mistlock
---
yeh thx no thx!
---
No
---
I'm not the one arguing an illogical point about how the mount suddenly changes the outcome of a fight immensely...because it DOESN'T.
---
Fights simply end faster for coordinated zergs. The bigger and more coordinated zergs will continue to win. NOTHING besides the duration of a fight changes.
---
Are you that stupid that you cannot comprehend that? Perhaps consider laying off the salt so your blood pressure isn't so high that you can't think straight.
---
But it does fit Melandru. It has a branch with red leaves winding around the head. 
---
Istan was still profitable for VM and Phylacteries. Now, I don't know if VM will be enough to sustain it.
---
75players per map, 80 queue, a total a ~600 players.
---
... now that I type that, it makes me realise how fucking dead this game is ._.
---
I think Herald is a lot easier, especially if you already know what your legends do. I would recommend half marauder/half berserker to start but you can always use more marauder pieces if you are dying.
---
Scourge is also easy but positioning is much more important compared to Rev because you only have 1 stunbreak for yourself so you are very dependant on having a good firebrand.
---
You see, I'm the opposite.  For me, the more serious someone sounds, the less seriously I treat them.
---
we've reached maximum catacity
---
So will the warclaw be for PoF players only, like all the other mounts? It seems like that'd be pretty unfair given that they can be used for siege, and presumably make it easier to gank mountless people.
---
Dude but imagine the sweet $20/16€ mount skins these zergs can ball under. Man it's going to be cool
---
 *throws last money at anet and dies 3 days later of starvation*
---
I agree regarding improvement, but with pugs there's loads of players with no interest in improving. Overall the improvement seems limited to a small subgroup of players that is actually playing the game. 
---
So for the same reason, not really worth to continue putting effort in. I lead rarely, casually if i feel like it on my terms. Even if its fun if you actively lead for a few weeks you quickly gather queues and players come over with little to no interest in playing with you past "there is commanders to follow yay!". 
---
Lead tonight for the mounts, was somewhat entertaining. Now i can slack for another 6 weeks ;) 
---
I'm just sad the animation continue when you sheat it it just looks weird
---
Revenge on the gods for being such back pedalers during the whole Nightfall and Balthazar debacle?
---
50? I had 100+ on every map XD
---
Would it even matter? I can't understand how the game has \~300 devs working on it and these laughable updates are what we get. All they do is release new skins every now and then. 0 actual content. Dont tell me the warclaw is content because it isnt, its just a way to sell mount skins to the WvW community, which they previously couldn't.
---
What do you mean not care- they LITERALLY JUST RELEASED A WVW-CENTERED UPDATE!!!
---
What is i22de ;wofqnu;eonu;qwefn;whneaf;hknwh.efhqef2n9f3n[1f0f3812nf809[1fnf3[1
---
Warrior player here. I've played this class and only this class since 2012 in all game modes. I've played with every iteration of WOD and I got to say, this is probably my favorite. First off, lets be real, WOD was made to be a WvW skill and nothing else. Sure it has some fringe uses in Fractals and stuff, but Anet has clearly intended WOD to play a specific role in WvW. 
---
Although I havn't gotten to test it much yet, the skill seems better in almost every capacity for WvW from the gameplay I've seen. It now removes more boons at a faster rate, has a shorter cast time, and can be moved to follow the movement of the enemy zerg. The only downside being of course that the Warrior now has to channel the skill. I feel that this may create alot more opportunity for interesting gameplay as your zerg will try to pump you with stab and the enemy zerg pump you with CC. Basically, the skill has become more poweful and more interactive, both of which WOD really needed. 
---
As far as sPvP, I think the skill becomes a bit better, but will still likely not see play. Especially when competing against Ramage. 
---
And yes, the skill is probably completely dead in PvE now. It doesn't really matter that you can move the bubble in PvE and having to sacrifice all your DPS to use it is quite a drawback here. 
---
Overall, I'm really happy with these changes and I think that, with Scourge corruption being pretty heavily nerfed, zergs will once again be looking to WOD to do alot of the boon stripping. 
---
Yeah dude, sure, and they're probably wasting money and people's working time on the alliance system just to sell more gems for transfers. You know nothing about overprices mount skins, this is an overpriced mount skin https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/world-of-warcraft-mount-vulpine-familiar and you can't even dye it.
---
I don't see locking warclaw behind expansion good idea. In this game mode mobility is a key and I can't think anything more frustrating than being left behind. 
---
At least allow anyone to mount up so start so they can at least keep up. Renting system (like already talked here) would be nice. Dolyak mount maybe?
---
As somebody who has to wait a few more hours before I can start my PC,patch and enjoy the content myself, I highly appreciate these posts. Thank you, Siegemaster Dulfy :3
---
&gt;  braindead builds
---
Spellbreaker was one of the harder builds to optimize for fractals, at least more so than any of the DPS.
---
So bringing mounts to WvW (after the WvW community expressed how it would be a shit change) just so they can sell mount skins to this previously untapped market (the WvW community) isn't a shameless cash grab?
---
Worked for me immidiately, i've started with the one in Rata Sum. Might be something wrong with WvW ones then, i've yet to get in again due to queues.
---
Are you serious?!?!?!
---
&gt;All they do is release new skins every now and then.
---
They released an entire new mount, which will change how combat and siege works. 
---
&gt;0 actual content
---
New collection and optional WvW lobby.
---
&gt;Dont tell me the warclaw is content because it isnt, its just a way to sell mount skins to the WvW community
---
It's content and and avenue for profit. Both.
---
You gonna be cool with ectos and mats spiking in prices again? Silverwastes manages to keep the lower tier mats prices down, Istan was good for ectos and higher tier mats. I fully expect the prices to increase as the supply drops. 
---
Is anyone not a bit suspicious that this came after Ncsoft's sudden increase in presence? I wouldn't be surprised if more changes like this occur to make the economy shit the bed, hoping that players will turn to their wallets.
---
I could also be doomspeaking.
---
Had to make sure this wasn't r/YEET for a second...
---
This is how I feel looking at the list of queues 
---
probably, will do those pieces some other time then :P
---
Nah, fuck deadeye.
---
or maybe that was the reason they got fired ??
---
I think this is the critical distinction. With other mounts the only advantage was that you might be able to get to the next POI faster or just spend less time in transit within the core and HoT maps than people who didn’t buy PoF. 
---
In WvW you could move so quickly that people without mounts will be left behind. If my understanding of WvW is correct, getting left behind generally means you die.
---
Can people literally stop calling for the game to be shut down? If you don't enjoy playing, just leave. 
---
Thank you for your developped argumentation sir
---
We sincerely hope you'll also consider swapping your credit card and help us combat the inflation on the gem/gold conversion. - anet 
---
the underwater mount nobody was expecting
---
Its been that way since developers have been able to patch games after release, this is absolutely nothing new, WoW has been doing it since it released. 
---
People still struggle to understand the concept, just because it seems ok under controlled testing doesn't mean it works when millions get a hold of it and do things you can never account for or test for.
---
Man all the nay sayers said i was wrong, guess i called it 😂
---
No, a number of individuals have it..  Most people do not have this issue.  Please do not suggest it affects everyone when it doesn't.
---
I'm not really a fan of the defiant glass skins, but I was able to use up 3 of my black lion tickets for a good 40g each, so I'm happy.
---
Do you want a new wvw map?
---
&gt; World vs World
---
AHAHAHA OH WOW
---
Lorewise, BL weapon skins are dodgy. Take the new Inquest skins from the Sandswept release. Actual Inquest are using these weapons. Clearly the logical explanation is that the BLTC got their hands on a few and decided to replicate them. 
---
The chronology is off, of course, but a) it's a cash shop release and they don't have to care and b) no one will care once episode 6 hits.
---
So, let's assume these weapons are meant to be replicas, too. Then there might be god worshippers featuring in the new story, who will be using these in battle. Depending on who they are, they might know something we don't, and they might be modelling their weapons after that. 
---
That said, none of the skins strike me as definitely related to a new god. Even the mace could definitely just be another Balthazar/Abaddon reference. 
---
Nothing silly about it. Predatory- is the word you're looking for.
---
Exactly. :(
---
Dropping the total amount of champions in Amala's boss fight to 5 from 24. 
---
Scummy would be locking the mount behind cash shop.
---
I just want to say, and I hope Anet is lurking, that the moment I feel like I am forced to pull out my wallet to get any meaningful progression done is the day I will sell my account on some shady website to a Chinese gold farmer. 
---
Right now, it's about the right level of grind.
---
Well, there are times you won't have people less than 100% health to actually heal. Spirits *always* lose health.
---
Ok, so those Melandru motives do return in the shortbow and staff design. But then those are weapons rangers can use too. Why give a weapon a color that neither "green" color coded professions can use? 
---
They could have made a blue Dwayna themed hammer for guardians or a red Balthazar themed one for warriors/revenants. All I'm saying is that the  green color just clashes with the skill colors of those professions.
---
Unless, we can expect the imminent return of bunny thumpers in the next expansion
---
Thank you!
---
numbers have never been confirmed so you got trolled and it's just speculation
---
Ah okay. I thought Silver might be what they description calls "normal difficulty" but I wasn't sure. Thanks!
---
RECORDID REPORDID DEPORTID
---
Stand close to the wall with nearly full health. The more your soul being knocked back, the more health you lose. With glass cannon classes like DE they have to be  near full health or theyre fked. 
---
It's almost like they're trying to monetize our game mode for the sake of betterment. Oh no!
---
Yeah cause wvw tchat has always been known as a source of knowledge and information.
---
Yes! Lets squeeze the last amount of revenue out of the dying playerbase that this mount will surerly improve as we have seen early in with engage ability stomping 10 players at once.... what?...
---
Mace and rifle are the only red ones and they strike me as more Balthazar related than Abaddon. Doesn't seem that Dhuum or Abaddon had gotten weapons in this set, that Grenth and Balth got 2 each while the other 4 got 3 each to make 16.
---
As to story relevance I doubt we'll see NPCs carrying these. Not sure what you meam by chronology being off though.
---
Lmao this is why you don't play to level 10, uninstall and then claim you know everything worth knowing about the game.
---
To be fair, you run soulbeast in chrono groups as well. Druid just doesn't cut it if you have to sacrifice 20-30% group DPS.
---
Too bad arrow carts got nerfed...
---
&gt; I love the Defiant weapon skins. That shield is beautiful.
---
Shield design is always on point. I just need a shield/shield build and I'll be a happy man.
---
That's because he also moved out of it as the camera rotated...
---

---
There's dedicated PvP modes. There's 3 game modes, PvE, small 5v5 arena PvP (sPvP), and large scale server PvP (WvW), which are all separate from each other.
---
You can't attack other players while playing in the PvE maps. 
---
&gt;this game
---
Implying absolutely everyone cares about the mount, which is most definitely not true.
---
How many builds does it have at level 10?
---
Please ANet.
---
Why does SW have to be the only way to make money?
---
Why can't we get some variety in our farming?
---
&gt;and redirects some damage from nearby allies to the engineer.
---
I loved you, Bulwark Gyro!  You were supposed to protect me from damage, not bring it directly into my face!  You were the chosen one!
---
\#Betrayal
---
Can't lose what you didn't have amirite
---
So, using a mechanic already in game that is intended for that exact purpose? For shame!
---
You doubt it, fair, but it is a definite possibility. 
---
And by chronology being off I mean: These weapons hit the CS before we get the episode in which they might appear, so you can only argue they will be replicas if you ignore the release times. 
---
Not a troll, but an actual inexperienced commander. A troll would have trait/rune on to avoid dying themselves.
---
People will get left behind if they don't have access to one.  Its like /u/Boase said, they need to have one to "rent" as long as they are on the map or else people are just going to give up because they can't keep up with zergs.
---
A lot of people are sitting on mounts instead of supporting the zerg as well.  I see a lot of pugs dying nearly instantly because so many people are just sitting on mounts jumping around or waiting to "sniff" out the enemy.  You can also see over walls much easier so its harder for zergs to surprise people with veil pushes or in/out portals.
---
I do think the mount has hurt roaming a lot.  People might still setup duels and whatnot but ganking is pretty much gone unless you have multiple people help you out.
---
Its whatever though.  I'm still sticking with what I said before it was released and that it wasn't necessary for WvW.  Its very meh feeling and I think there were much more important things for the developers to focus on.  I don't think mounts will have any retention rate for WvW as well.  I don't see how this will attract more mainly PvP or PvE players to WvW and have them stick around.  Whether or not that was or part of the goal for this, its not going to happen.  They need to please who is left to get them to talk other into joining.  Not just some mount that has people join up for a week or so and never again.
---
You can spar all around the map, as long as you're outside the central building.
---
No one's gonna work for free, dude. You already know that they're working on alliance system, what else do you want from them? If you hate them so much, then why are you playing this game? Play something else and be happy.
---
Just give the warclaw the ability to carry another person (either that or make that and supply transport the defining characteristic of a possible dolyak mount).
---
No participation at all.
---
&gt;  it just looks like a seriously condenced Lion's Arch.
---
That's the idea, really. Just a convenient condensed hub with everything you need, accessible via an item you click on in your inventory.
---
That's good to know. I've got a full set of heavy marauder armor too, so it should be easy to slot in more of those pieces as needed. Rev is what I have more playtime on as well, so that's probably an important consideration re: legend usage. I appreciate the input!
---
Wvw reward track gives 50. You need to complete it 5 Times, and the minimum time you can do is 4h20min for 1 track, which is a full 250 rubies for 19 hours. 10 days, 2 hours/day and you are done 
---
Same at blue.
---
This is what I have been thinking...
---
It isn't like the ability has a 1000 range aoe or anything...
---
Blobs are not fun, now blobs may have a counter and not be the ideal tactic.
---
Zero.
---
Exactly the kind of competitive achievements we needed!
---
"Tyria’s top crafters came together to forge these weapons from the ruins of temples to the Six Gods."  
---
Literally from official announcement, i guess they're themed around respective Orr temple styles
---
Oh baby.
---
Custom bloodstone node icons soon too, right? Right?
---
One day you'll understand that other people will have different opinions than you and that's okay.
---
Until then, go back to playing Fortnite or League or whatever it is you usually do. 
---
Yeah, I'm kinda sad this wasn't a full lobby to begin with, WvW has always needed one.
---
One of the few LS maps that's not dead after 3 weeks from release? Better fix that
---
Completely agree, a place like this is perfect.
---
Decorations were a mistake, and one of the big reasons the current guild halls feel so terrible.
---
you trade 33% torment damage + burn procs for 5% condi duration
---
And once you unlock the mount you can't even use it in EOTM
---
More like guild halls should have been something like this instead.
---
Not correct.  That's 75 players per **server** per borderland.  That means 225 players per borderland, total.  EU has 5 tiers and NA has 4 tiers and there are 4 borderlands so that is 225\*4\*9 = 8100.  Before, we had 240\*4\*9 = 8640 so they reduced the number of people that can play WvW at any given time by 540.
---
This community is hilarious, they love to \*\*\*t on other gamemodes for things but when it is their gamemode they riot and whine.  Imagine if Anet capped the number of instances in open world PvE so only 4 Auric Basins could be active at any time and you had to sit in a queue to get into a map.  Imagine the complaints then.
---
Quick question, cuz I haven't been in EOTM in ages, can you compete reward tracks there? Namely the Gift of Battle. I was intending to take advantage of the influx of players this week to complete it.
---
This. Seems less effective than good necro bomb.
---
We're seeing people on warclaws pounce-finish a small field full of red downed players, right?
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.

---
It is a pun with 'capacity' and, if you read it like that, sounds okay.
---
Maybe that's a rhetorical question, but there is an answer. Because tribalism. It's that simple.
---
Why? The best guess goes something like this. Back in the day, tribal politics could easily be lethal. Rather than selecting for a predisposition to rational discourse, selective pressures favored blind loyalty and hostility to differing thought.
---
Rational thinkers don't all reach the same conclusions, because they don't all share foundational suppositions. But tribalism blows right past cognitive dissonance, it doesn't matter if the tribe and the individual hold contradictory beliefs. In this way, it manages to build a much cohesive group from differing individuals. If you're a bunch of hunter gatherers struggling to survive, competing against similar groups and factions within your own group, that cohesion and dogged perseverance leaves you much more resilient in external and internal conflicts.
---
These days, we don't have to worry nearly so much about getting killed due to politics. But the ingrained reflex persists. The high stakes (ostracism or being outright killed) left it on a hair trigger, because inconsequential stuff *could* do you in by simple virtue of challenging the consensus. Internal politics is usually a game of tit for tat, and it proved better to be extremely aggressive, extremely defensive, and completely arational.
---
This is why people get so defensive over their video games, and will do loads of mental gymnastics to justify something that's as close to objectively bad as you can get.
---
something i've learned about wvw: join the blue tag if you're not part of any guild/zerg
---
There's a free warclaw you can ride if you just want to test it out.
---
Haven't they been working on it for more than a year already? How much longer is it going to take? I see time and resources wasted on every update for rebalancing (nerfing) classes that noone asked and for more fashion wars than the actual game's problems. Everything keeps becoming more grindy and less rewarding with every update release.
---
The WvW was fine before they decided to ruin pve with the "megaservers". You could have a pve guild that would also do WvW. Now everyone is in different servers and you have to transfer all the time to where other people are. It didn't affect the game at first because everyone was at the same server but as more people joined the game and others left you are now forced to change servers all the time or you will be stuck on a dead server. Don't tell me that $20-$30 for every server change is not overpriced too (especially when it's the game's fault)...
---
[Can confirm that with an image too.](https://i.imgur.com/PJHXyow.png)
---
Oh well, guess that'll be shelved for later.
---
Then it was a failure on some part, but they effing tried to shake up what is a barely touched 6yo gamemode and failed to bring in new players. In the meantime quit acting entitled and exclusionary to the incomers. *Your* playing isn't enough to save this game-mode.
---
oh so pvp is only for players after 60lvl or if they pay
---
other than that its just if they agree on duel, but if they dont, you cant kill them
---
HAHAHHH not exciting
---
whats the point of getting better build or eq than my enemy if i can later kill him? i will fight vs mobs infinitely?
---
I would have sex with joe
---
That, too.
---
what an useless reddit if you cant even complain because some mad mod will defend his fav game with chair
---
ok
---
No, you didn't do any research on the game, claim to be level 10 and judge an MMO literally by the first hour and features it will never have and was never advertised with.
---
Nice troll, I give it a 5 out of 7
---
the mounts were used when they came around the corner and not a single one of them died there. all the displayed warscore there is fake, result of a known bug
---
actually its funny and ironic comparison cause u compared fortnite to g2 as if gw2 was better, but both playerbases have no standards, arent picky towards games they play and its probably first big title they tried
---
Worked fine on my female charr.
---
go spend another 1200h mindlessly killing mobs in a game where u cant do anything else
---
Decorations were a mistake. Should have been used for player housing instead.
---
I'll do just that, because I'm not a blind person trying to give critique on a painting I never saw and never will see.
---
I'm slightly biased as in play guard but why do I always see random nerfs to guard in pvp. Is it honestly that strong ? Just let it be
---
Same put all the teleporting items in it, lws books, lily of elon, exulted chamber item and sunspear artifact.
---
Yeah, after 6 years and 8000 hours in this game they pull this shit on me. I DEMAND a refund!
---
....... (/s)
---
&gt; as planned
---
lol
---
I'll repeat myself. Once the remaining players decide to leave the game aswell, let's get back here and discuss where anet went wrong.
---
&gt; theres no free open world pvp to non paying players, maybe if u levl up to 60
---
At level 60 WvW which is open world PvP is available to FREE players. Learn to read. It's a freaking MMO, EVERY MMO every made requires you to level up to have access to all of the content.
---
&gt; also i said what the game is lacking, THATS WHY IT WAS IN DOUBLE QUOTES, but clerly you cant read, because what can i expecet from gw2 player? lmao
---
I mean you're the one who has made it pretty clear that they can't understand simple English when people try to explain things to you. 
---
&gt; unmod urself, baseless
---
No, instead I'm going to be banning you for attacking members of our community as I have seen your other posts here. So once again, take care now, bye bye then.
---
I've been playing the thief a long time, and tried just about every build you can possibly play. I never thought to leave the offhand unequipped.  You learn something new every day.
---
“Of course it’s a shameless cash grab”

“So you’re saying it isn’t a shameless cash grab!?!?”

I guess they got....S-wiped. LUL

Good catch! I honestly didn't notice

The fractal one is usually pretty packed. 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mistlock_Sanctuary_Passkey

It's available from time to time.

&gt;when it lasted

I don not thinker this is how saying 
---
&gt;It was great experience
---
When OP can't grammar
---
Thank you.  I think I can take it from here. :)
---
That sucks... At least you won't be anywhere near short on statuettes when they appear in that vendor in like half a year and then it's guaranteed. 
---
Man, I just want a straight up "Battle Cat" skin. lol
---
You only need to keep 2 shades up, assuming you have correct set up. 3 shades will over cap your bleeding duration, and the lost of 33% torment dmg and burn is massive dps lost.
---
Hmm Warclaw speed in PvE is 550 u/s
---
This about Russia version.
---
Sorry it didnt reflect but absorb.
---
But even for PvE removing this amount of boons and enemies cannot gain boons is really strong. The time you channel it is worth the investment IMO and keep in mind you could interrupt channel to do something else.
---
Banner skills wasnt use and poorly design. Removing them was a good thing and was done amazingly.
---
Nice English 
---
The space he had between the orb and him is too long to have moved out during the camera spins.  He was never in the orb. 
---
This is a sad attempt at a meme.
---
You can argue that others needed buffs, but I’m not sure you can argue Istan didn’t also need nerfs lol
---
... what did you think the "world" in "world vs world" was?
---
It isn't.
---
Lots of places that were intentionally designed to be farms have been nerfed to be worse than SW, instead of being tuned to produce a comparable amount of gold. Istan isn't the only one.
---
I just wish that we had different maps that yielded similar returns that we could farm on, rather than "the one." Tuning it shouldn't be that hard. It's a matter of doing some math. "This is what SW is going to output, on average. How do we change the numbers over here to output something similar?"
---
This thread proofs once again that WvW players are mostly whiny little bitches who don't want nor deserve a change of pace in WvW for even one day.
---
Lol, your last post got taken down because you literally know shit about the game and now you troll again with your bad grammar and html "hacking" skills :D 
---
Grow up, kid.
---
I’m guessing you gon’ get run down and fed to the warclaw if they kill you. 
---
Its bug related to bloodlust.
---
I'm interested how this will work out for roamers. Wouldn't you be at an extreme disadvantage against other roamers if you didn't have the mount?
---
I'll also repeat myself, it's already a doomed game, you and your ilk weren't enough and the mode died a year or two early. Congrats for sitting around entitled and patting yourself on the back agreeing with each other about how very right you were. I'll just pour one out for the memories and move on with my life.
---

---
Nice job, google translate 
---
“Doing things should make gold” also means that NOT doing things should also make gold. Solid logic. Maybe you should have taken a class on how to reason.
---
Clearly one farm is always going to be the best, but it shouldn’t be by such a large margin as Istan was. It drives down the value of everything in the game.
---
I got it on my alt , core acc :)
---
*Hi human!* It's your **4th Cakeday** DragonWhimsy! ^(hug)
---
This recent area added an amazing skybox to the surrounding landscape. It really brings out the depth of the landscape and I would absolutely love if more skyboxes like this were put into future zones. Whoever designed this sky-box and environment kudos to them!
---
Oh my bot, I removed it because I was changing how authentication works and it was a mess so I got angry one day and well, it happens.  
---
Now I am working on the teamspeak5 version of the bot (beta for ts5 starts on march 15).  
---
  
---
OP, if you want to know how to set up such a bit and the code of my bot, send me a message and I'll guide you. Make sure your server has installed Python 3.6 and then it should be fine.
---
Any tips on how to farm the map materials? 
---
The metal-head alter (but still hyper-inflated) ego of Jeremy Soule.
---
Breach happens at bar completion 100%. Vinewrath happens after breach, regardless of success or failure.  
---
I think they're wrong about the bar progressing on its own, though. If none of the forts are held, i don't think bar will go anywhere. 
---
I was more going off the dhuumfire/shade auto procs than the bonus stats. As in youd constantly get 3x proc vs 1-2x proc.
---
&gt; If you’re talking raids pre-GOTL nerf, we had Phalanx Strength with 2 warriors. 
---
Once condi tempest became viable due to the changes to arcane power, running condi tempests with scepter/warhorn for might stacking and a pure dps condi berserker with banners was also a fine setup. My group used it plenty.
---
The only real way to effectively farm is to just cycle through map metas again and again
---
The masteries I'd recommend for general purpose are the gliding ones. The rest of the masteries don't really have an impact outside of the HoT maps
---
But for navigating the jungle itself, you want updrafts and bouncing mushrooms first, and then everything else can kind of go as you please
---
Don't forget the underwater mount!
---
&gt; While this is true, there's a reason dropping patch notes a week early is generally not done (as a rule).... because in modern development, the Changelog/patch notes aren't usually finalized until the full release time.
---
The changes the previous poster referred to are not even documented in the official patch notes released with the update.
---
Oh fuck is someone actually unironically suggesting fractal leaderboards?
---
I was mistaken.   It actually gives +1 war score for every enemy you hit with the pounce...even if you don't kill them.   It's misleading because it looks like more people are dying.   So it's just broken in a different way lol.
---
where is this place?
---
&gt;at least not in the gem store
---
Cracked me up proper this one. Lol
---
Yeah but srsly *what* is worth buying?
---
Nothing besides Shards for legendarys is of any worth imo...
---
Old Karma Armor from Orr can be obtained in fractals too.
---
Ye seems like they didn't test that you can't mount in what is effectively classed as a jumping puzzle zone :P
---
I wish the backpack would look like the glider, this way the glider looks good and the backpack kinda boring.
---
Swordfish mount. I need to pretend I'm DK riding Enguarde.
---
Do i need something special to run this?
---
It references more wvw armor set (wielded tentacle things)  than pharus imo
---
Money was the purpose of the mount.
---
Some of those are very risky, and the scale with your level. The enemies from the quests do not give exp, so they can't be farmed. One has to do them daily to level up.
---
Yeah! xD but instead of ranking time it would rank who goes further!
---
I'd recommend Gliding 2, Itzel 2, Exalted 1, and Nuhoch 1 as those are what you need to unlock the various story steps.
---
After those I'd say Gliding 5 (Advanced Techniques) as that and everything below it can be used anywhere.
---
He lost me when he decided we all needed to know about how he lost his virginity.
---
That is the western damn in the Alpine Borderlands.
---
Well the rate when farming the nodes are normal compared to other living story map nodes which got buffed in today's patch
---
If you're a class cannon under the effects of Defiance, are you still a glass cannon? 🤔
---
it needs to be run from the command prompt since it has no UI.
---
If it fits, it sits.
---
Oh wow.
---
I'm amazed there wasn't a literal parade in the streets because of this. That is for letting me know.
---
That might work if they didn't have 3 evades at 500 range each.
---
Yikes 
---
How long will the new WvW  boost last?
---
I always loved this review. I was already a Gw1 player but, had moved on to WoW so was hesitant to jump into Gw2 but this review got me soo hyped.
---
But brings home the money, and that's something you can buy your groceries with. 
---
Is this in the new 1k gems gated area?
---
1 week.
---
If you have a mount, simply mount up, dismount and mount up again in quick succession.
---
The second time you’re summoning your mount the minions will not have finished spawning yet, so they’re destroyed instead.
---
&gt;Break game mode with poorly thought out and implemented gimmick features
---
&gt;Fail to fix serious fundamental issues and instead introduce fluff content and monetisation
---
"whiny little bitches"
---
In one sense, yes WvW players are whiny. But they also have reason to whine. 
---
I can easily admit the game flaws, the lack of instanced content, unfair monetization of living world towards new players, lack of better new player experience in terms that the game poorly explain it's mechanics, lack of pvp and wvw updates, so how am i ruining gw2 again? By spreading misinformation like you do? Or maybe i didn't played this game for 6 years? Your previous comment doesn't make sense, your idiotic conspiracy theories about linking world doesn't make sense, if not the megaserver you'll be stuck on your dead server both in pve and wvw by now, it not server linking, everyone would leave your server for a more active one anyway and you wouldn't have a chance to experience proper wvw for free, if arenanet wouldn't monetize their game, it would be dead and if you'd think with your head just for a couple of minutes you wouldn't say such retarded things. I'm out, have fun in your little world.
