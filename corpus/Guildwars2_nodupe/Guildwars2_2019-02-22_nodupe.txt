---
 \- Put in gliders/mounts/armor sets as regular in game rewards (not one glove at the end of an achievement checklist every 3 months)
---
 \- Actually release multiple dungeons and raids at the launch of their expansion. 
---
 \- Add multiple difficulty levels to their dungeons and raids.
---
 \- Maintain and support side activities (Guild Missions, Guild Halls, WvW, PvP)
---
It's confirmed so haHAA to you sir.
---
They are merging their game publishing departments. I am not in the know-how of how exactly game companies are set up, so pls correct me if I am wrong. Merging publishing departments should not affect the development team of a successfully running business division (arenanet gw2). Yes, it might impact their business model (moving more towards p2w??) or any work on long term projects. But other than that, I don't expect significant changes to the ongoing game or the game direction itself.
---
My sympathies to those who are impacted. I have seen three such changes in my company in last few years and it's never pretty. The empty office spaces you come to the next day, just hits your gut. 
---
Better question: Why would they cut ArenaNet lose? Why would they create another competitor when they just kill it? (assuming that's where this leads)
---
&gt; Their problems lie in their content model.
---
Thats where inefficiency comes in.
---
Didn’t they just offer positions to Blizzard people? Maybe Activision is hiring.
---
Guild Wars 2 is going to be fine because of the monetization model and it still being a solidly popular IP in the west with unique gameplay/aesthetics. Most MMORPGs that end up dying are WoW clones and/or generic overhyped Korean MMOs. 
---
You suck.
---
you don't know what says the contract between ncsoft and anet, also anet probably is to poor to buy itself
---
Raids and other side-projects prove ArenaNet management is the cancer killing the company.
---
They should be the ones getting fired, but they never pay for their mistakes.
---
Istan was one of the last 5?? Oh yeez.
---
No. To be honest, I'd be playing FFXIV if I wanted to pay a fee.
---
They can't speak about the future when there is no future
---
Few months back Mike Z said in an article  in regards to going straight to season 5: “our living world is working”. Clearly it’s not. 
---
I love gw2, but if i dont even use netflix or spotify because of subscriptions, gw2 stands no chance.  
---
  
---
Instead of feeling refreshed after playing sonething els for a wee bit I will just feel guilty about spending my cash and stop entirely.
---
I always see people in Jahai and Kourna. The only time I've seen a Kourna meta not happen is late like (i.e. 2am) Pacific.
---
Sandswept is dead
---
It's confirmed so.. haHAA
---
Most likely not, because GW1 costs Anet basically nothing to maintain. Given that there are very few employees who work on maintaining GW1, I don't think it's going anywhere.
---
&gt; They seem to have a number of side and unreleased projects.
---
Since today "used to have"
---
Raids and wvw are different content that require different types of support and utility. Spirits would have low value in wvw even if they were glued to druid and invulnerable. What's your point?
---
Yeah, there was some insider information about that. I don't remember where I read it, but I think it was from some WildStar developer, near the shutdown of their game.
---
One year and five months.  Counting is hard evidently.
---
RIP that one WvW dev.
---
Yeah I was just about to rebuy GW1 because I want the nostalgia but I’ll wait to see if the servers will even be maintained now
---
I highly doubt a GW3 is on the horizon if GW2 is indeed going belly-up.
---
Probably not, seeing how there is nobody working on GW1 anyway, and it's just hosted by Amazon.
---
All the GW1 updates this last year were just done in the dev's spare time.
---
Bungie wasn't owned by Activision, they had a 10 year contract giving Activision publishing rights.
---
Anet is a subsidiary of NCSoft; they can't choose to split from NCSoft because NCSoft makes the decisions.
---
Soon there will be no community once ncsoft pulls the plug
---
I have no interest in FF.
---
Based on the article the layoffs are more than just those involved in publishing.
---
&gt; Do you guys think that Arena will close GW1
---
Because shutting down unattended servers will somehow save them a ton of money? 
---
They did add a MOBA style PvP mode.
---
It fucking bombed because chasing trends doesn't equal the same results
---
&gt; Camps and towers are referred to by their cardinal direction only. NEC = northeast camp, SWT = southwest tower. 
---
Would add that we (Deso + links, so I assume a big chunk of EU) do use nicknames for towers in borders. Northern towers: Sunnyhill = Sunny, Woodhaven = Woody, Dawn's Eyrie = Dawns, Cragtop = Crag, Odel academy = Odel, Necropolis = Necro. Southern towers on alpine borders are often called Briar and Lake, on desert border it's Crank and Parched.
---
Desert border garrison isn't only Ramparts, but also ramps, stoic, earth keep and other variations.
---
&gt;Spirits would have low value in wvw even if they were glued to druid and invulnerable.
---
FFS that's exactly what my first post said: spirits aren't good because they can't move anymore. If they could it would be a game changer for druids. Christ.
---
Wait, WoW has less than 400 people working on it? Huh. I would expect it to have a bigger team than that. 
---
As far as I'm aware, Bungie-Activision was partnership. Bungie was it's own, independent business. In addition, if Activision hadn't seemingly let them split off without a fight, there probably would have been a legal battle over Destiny.
---
Anet, however, is not in the same boat. They were acquired by NCsoft are a completely owned by NCsoft. Now remember what happened with City of Heroes, they *owned* the rights for CoH completely. The original team even tried to buy the rights and NCsoft basically back handed them. They would do the same to Anet if it ever comes to that.
---
Ah okay, thanks
---
I main power reaper and never got kicked from any raid so far. As long as you do mechs, you're fine. And if a comm kicks you because of your class, don't raid with that comtard anyway.
---
yup, All or Nothing was the LS4E5, while Dawn was the LS4E1
---
So is not being a cunt it seems 
---
I play ESO. The fee is an optional thing for supporters. You get unlimited bag space, 1,650 crowns to spend in the crown store each month and all DLC access. A lot of people feel it's worth it. I don't pay it but I totally understand it's value.
---
Lets be fair. Its an aging game and bringing out continuous expansions will hit a ceiling as well at some point.  
---
This was going to happen sooner or later unless ANET branched further than just GW2.  
---
This isnt good news but this doesn't spell the end of the game at all. Just means that they need to refocus their efforts into more long term projects. 
---
Sounds, to me, like NCSoft made the decision and informed ArenaNet without much warning. Sounds like they're still figuring out who's going and staying, etc.
---
[Guild Wars 2, Tyria and the players right now.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPfQogtS2Eo)
---
Active accounts =/= Money.
---
Istan with as many exp boost as you can maintain is probably best.
---
Really? Hahaha.
---
Did they ever?
---
No one is making fun of them, why even make this post?
---
I brought the point up like 5 years ago and got screamed into a corner. Can't talk when they don't want to listen.
---
When they said it, it probably would have been smart to say 'and after season 5 we're aiming for another expansion, but that's a ways off, so we're not talking about it'. Even the hint of one further off would be comforting to a lot of people. 
---
I specifically said multiple times that they suck regardless of movement implementation. They don't bring anything valuable to wvw...static or not, they are useless. The only useful one would be traited elite spirit.
---
Ranger with spirits offers nothing more than any other support build.
---
Reaper main here for 5yrs or so now. 70% solo roamer.. 20% duo/havoc, 10% running with a specific tag.
---
I hold my own, but as many have said, I am ez pickings for the likes of anyone holding a decent kite/outranging me. If you make me chase you, I'm likely to say fuck it and turn around, cause my mobility is equal to that of a snail on meth. Thinks she's going fast, really is not going fast enough.
---
It's still enjoyable enough that I have zero consideration of changing classes, but at times I do get frustrated against classes with several ways to eat my damage, and condi meme classes. I just deal with it and move on.
---
Give it a try, you can make it work for you if you don't take the losses seriously.
---
Also, try the Firework runes out, they're actually pretty nifty in my opinion. I still carry a set of Scholar runes around if the situation calls for it but I really have no complaints about the FW runes for now.
---
Good luck whatever you decide. o/
---
It's untrustworthy info bc it was from a dev that worked in Wildstar during it's final days. It was determined by some people that the specific dev never actually worked with Paragon Studios.
---
What?  Are you referring to sPvP?
---
Pfft where does FFXIV give 10-20h of content a month?
---
Who needs protection and might in WvW amiright?
---
This smells more like NCSoft dumping brands that aren't theirs in favor of their Lineage cash cows, again.
---
I mean you can start claiming "most" at like 50.1% population, so without hard numbers for/against that isn't biased "most" really doesn't mean much.  Plus if 20, 30, or even 40% of WvWers like the changes or are excited by them that's still a sizeable portion that shouldn't be disregarded just because "most" wvwers don't like this
---
I would if I felt it worthwhile but I don't like the raids on this game because of how easy they are and because I don't like the way they've gone with group combat in the past few years with elite specs. I voted "Maybe?" because I'm willing to pay money if I feel it worthwhile, I've definitely spent a decent chunk on games in the past 2-3 years that I've been hopping around on thanks to having an income for it that I didn't previously when I was a student.
---
I have no issue paying for subscriptions because it means that the game likely is going to release a lot more content for me to have fun with. I mean, even if I get bored of a game I can just cancel the subscription until I feel like playing again anyways so yeah, what's the harm in that? Subscription fees mostly just hurt the players who aren't willing to spend money anyways.
---
That's because he has to protect his sources, both for his career and their's. If he named his source or gave even the slightest hints about them, they'd both be up shit creek. This is the case for all journalism when it comes to unannounced stuff like this.
---
It's better than LS1 where it was never repeatable at all, as cool as it was now THAT was a waste of resources. At least this way content stays there forever for new people or when working on an alt. They can also always use that content to return to if they want to. 
---
As for living world instances, they are repeatable for getting all the achievements. I think trying to turn each one in a 5 man dungeon in addition to a story instance would be four times the resources to make. There's also a lot of people who just want to do the story solo having to find groups to do them with isn't everyone's cup of tea.
---
And GW1's "sudden return".
---
Someone was desperate to cash in quickly for some reason. Too late, I guess.
---
Didn't you know? Condis just magically pop on your bar. Which is why so many professions are playing condi on pvp, it isn't an issue with just just mirage or scourge, oh no. People aren't playing scourge for their oppressive aoe on a point capture and field control PvP modes. Or a class that can have better movement skills than a thief with just 1 weapon attack on a dodge cooldown.
---
I don't even think I want to try and get the mount at this point. I've never played WvW, I'm a pretty casual player, and reading this thread/other threads has done nothing to make me think "Hey! I should try this out!"
---
Just doesn't seem like it's for me.
---
Catgirl ERP, obviously.
---
The publishing division, not the whole studio. 
---
It isn’t that big of a change. NCsoft was their publisher when GW2 launched. 
---
His fur looks very soft.
---
I browsed through a lot of comments and have not seen anyone making jokes or being unkind about them? Am I missing something here?
---
&gt; I've always disliked ArenaNet management (since most of the game's problems point directly at them), but today they've crossed a new milestone. Just wow.
---
Actually if you read the article it was NCSoft's CEO that sent out a mass e-mail announcing the upcoming layoff. Not really ArenaNet management this time around.
---
Yeah, this was my first thought as well. It was obviously just an empty gesture, the social media people have no power over who gets hired, and ANet had positions open. They were just drumming up some juicy clicks by pointing out that they're hiring, in the guise of goodwill.
---
I dunno, this didn't even cross my mind. THe only thing that occurs to me is that the game might be dead.
---
It was a blunder from the get-go to lean so hard into WoW-style raiding in a game that shines brightest with a full map of people.
---
Financially speaking, NCSoft basically *is* full mobile - MMOs made up less than a third of their total earnings in 2018.
---
Translation- "I started the obvious, now give me karma"
---
Still waiting for skill lagg fix so noone has an excuse for dying off tag. But alas anet enforces the casuals once again every wvw patch. 
---
It's not getting shut down or anything. Still many years of fun for you to have!
---
The year long content drought leading up to HoT didn't exactly help it. 
---
On top of gutting dungeon rewards and moving the liquid gold into Fractals, neatly tucked behind mastery; it also effectively destroyed small guilds. The guild change alone stopped my group of friends from logging in completely.
---
By the time PoF was announced, my circle was running on fumes as far as interest goes. LS3 started out so goddamn strong too with the narrative and tone only for it to devolve back into a saturday morning cartoon as soon as Ep2 hit. It was all just down hill from there.
---
and AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH
---
ArenaNet fails at communication even among themselves.
---
What an utter lack of respect for their employees.
---
Their moba mode was a travesty and a sign of how inefficient they have been. There were so many other modes they could have added which would align more closely with the existing game design and use existing maps but they wasted money on that. And with this news today I doubt spvp will receive any substantial development any more. WvW as well they might even cancel alliances. 
---
Down to earth or no he has mismanaged the hell out of ArenaNet.
---
Or from their own mistakes, which is even worse.
---
Anet is one of my favorite devs and I will buy any PC game/expansion they make. But they don't really give us many chances to buy games from them with only 3 releases in 12 years. I hope a staff reduction doesn't mean increased low effort monitization like p2w and lootboxes.
---
I'm currently leveling an Asura Guardian. With the Electroplated cultural armor dyed the right way I feel six feet tall.
---
If they were intelligent, they wouldn't be fanboys.
---
I'm dead serious when I consider them more harmful for a company than haters and trolls.
---
 
---
It’s probably too late for anyone to see this, but I want to try and make our soon to be new members feel welcomed!
---
**Quick tips, I'm not sure if mentioned.**
---
If you see your SMC outer wall down from enemy siege from a secure location, don’t bother repairing until the problem siege has been taken care of. You will just end up wasting supplies. You will see people saying “don’t repair”. 
---
· Don’t throw/build siege sites on the edge of a wall, it can easily be taken down from the enemy players below and even standing on the edge is a death wish.
---
· Supply traps are fun! They cost you 10 supplies to lay down, but keep in mind they expire after 1 hour or disappear if you leave the map! You can only have 1 active trap at a time per player.
---
· Siege have a 60min timer, but can be extended by clicking/getting on them. Once a siege site hits 0 it disappears forever. Save supply and be prepared by keeping siege refreshed! 
---
Siege placement and executing a well place shot is an art form, don’t be scared to ask questions about it during some downtime. The people that know how to use siege well are passionate and like when players know how to use siege and place sites!
---
Welcome new friends to WvW! Can’t wait to share my love for WvW with you!! :D
---
Low ping? Ever since i came back to the game ive been over 300 ping, did they change something? Im not the only one from OCX that has this problem too
---
From reading the articles it seems like this was dropped on the Anet bosses themselves without much warning. 
---
They may not have even had time to go through who they can let go, other than tell everyone that it's happening.
---
No
---
Thank you for posting these! I dont know if its too late or not, I was hoping this thread would still be up tomorrow and maybe the weekend when more people get active, but sharing it around in guilds would help educate some more people :) I will add your points in the morning when I get to work as I have to sleep right now!
---
This. If anything, look at recent "competition" between Steam and EGS. Look at endless "innovations" of Battle Royales and lootboxes in every game. Look at console exclusives, hell, consoles themselves - they exist simply because one company wants "their" cut of the market. It benefits no one - not developers, not consumers. Just good old moneybags. Screw that. Art can't prosper when it has to constantly rely on sales.
---
yeah mobile games are dominating the market soon, whenever you like it or not (they are already making way more then pc or console), you can simply rip of people way easier here (microtransactions stems from this after all) and you can invest much less in games since the demand for quality and content is also way lower...
---
Not the kind of balance changes I was hoping for
---
She did eat the self-reviving Joko...
---
1- It was probably before the decision was made, plus we don't know if those position offered were the same that may be subject to the current layoffs.
---
2- The problem of the Blizzard-Activision layoffs wasn't in the layoffs themselves, but in how and when they were announced to the employees and especially the reason why (all while giving a sweet sweet bonus to a newly hired high-positioned dude).
---
Damn. Looks line I should halt any potential gemstore purchases going forward. No point in paying for a game that may not last much longer, relatively speaking. A shame. My favorite MMO aside from OSRS, which isn't really comparable and is in it's own category anyways.
---
When you don't give names, it's not a warning, it's fearmongering.
---
And yes, it's worse.
---
A developer reportedly debunked that claim.
---
blizzards doesn't really exist anymore even the higher-ups are almost all replaced by activation people now 
---
Lower compared to EU. 
---
FFXIV's redo almost bankrupted SE. It's not even needed here, the circumstances are massively different.
---
Raids are dead.  Fractals might be.  Alliance system on indefinite hold.
---
In a statement provided to GamesIndustry.biz, ArenaNet confirmed that some staff reduction was planned, though the number to be affected was not specified.
---
"We can confirm that due to the cancellation of unannounced projects, ArenaNet will make staff reductions," the statement reads. "This is part of a larger organizational restructuring within NCSOFT in the west, but the Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2 game services will not be affected, nor is any upcoming game content canceled."
---
Also, everyone's favorite villain also was mentioned and gave some interesting tidbits:
---
&gt; Former Guild Wars 2 writer Jessica Price (who was controversially let go last year following a Twitter exchange) said the layoffs were "not surprising" and added detail on other projects going on behind the scenes at the company as of last year.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; "[ArenaNet] had two major projects in the works when I was there. One was indefinitely suspended while I was still there. For those of us working on GW2, our mandate was essentially to make it look like there was the same level of resources devoted to GW2, when they were actually steadily moving people off of it onto the other projects.
---
&gt; "It was bad enough that at one point we were told we could only have one cinematic for Ep5 (All or Nothing), which, given that it was the climax of the season and had more heavy emotional beats than anything else we'd done (at least while I was there), was devastating."
---
Quite fascinating really.
---
Lots of things are denied by lots of people. When I was a kid, I knocked over a lamp and said I didn't do it. It's proof of pretty much nothing. Look NcSoft didn't close City of Heroes for zero reason. It wasn't losing money it was making money. There had to be some reason to close it. Just because no one shared that reason with us, doesn't mean it didn't exist. I believe there's  more to that story than meets the eye. I get that you liked the game and you're hurt that it was closed. But that doesn't mean it was closed for no reason.
---
&gt; Scourge
---
&gt; trash
---
Soon you will realize the true value of a scourge.
---
Companies are not their employee's friends, either.
---
She's likely pleading for the sake of those who are getting laid off, not NCSoft or Anet's leadership.
---
Thought it was a Carbine employee that made the claim...
---
Turns out some consumers don't enjoy being martyrs for corporate finance.
---
SWToR laid off a third of their staff when it was only six months old. It wasn't the end of SWToR. 
---
If you read tweets from some of the devs and add the blizzard tweet its obvious this decision happened very fast from NCsoft and Anet had no idea until it happened. I'm all for fear mongering but use logic.
---
&lt;3 stop &lt;3 posting &lt;3 pointless &lt;3 threads &lt;3 for &lt;3 Karma &lt;3 because &lt;3 so &lt;3 far &lt;3 I &lt;3 have &lt;3 not &lt;3 seen &lt;3 one &lt;3 person &lt;3 taking &lt;3 light &lt;3 of &lt;3 the &lt;3 situation &lt;3 at &lt;3 all

Instant death? No.
---
Slow agonizing death? Maybe, but I'd wager we were already experiencing something like that before the recent announcements.
---
Except that's not what is happening here at all. This is across NCsoft as a whole. That's over 3000 employees.
---
I think it's telling that no one directly involved with GW2 is being affected.
---
Depends on the model they use and what a sub fee gets you. Given that GW2 was designed to give people who have money to blow and those who don't an equal playing field, coming up with a good balance that doesn't alienate either side wouldn't be easy. Either they'd have to come up with some brand new premium stuff or they'd have to remove things from people who don't pay the sub, neither of which would go over well.
---
(Though I still wouldn't pay for it, personally, even if they pulled it off.)
---
If I was being paid the same no matter what, I would be doing what I wanted not making something for someone else. I got an education and a good job because I was motivated to make more money so I could live the way I wanted to. 
---
Do you know a lot of people that don't care about money at all and just go to work for fun? 
---

---
I need to know more about that. What were they working on?!
---
Have you even played the new maps outside of the story for more than a couple seconds?
---
Counterpoint, some people seem to be enjoying the stuff that's been produced in the last two years. Wish you were here.
---
/u/Exfrus got you covered on this. But if you have HoT I recommend going to the Verdant Brink map and asking "Anyone doing an HP train?"
---
(in case you didn't know) HP Trains are experienced players with a Commander tag leading groups through the expansion's maps and meta events so they can get all of the hero points and mastery points. You will need to play enough of HoT to get basic gliding mastery to be able to keep up (A good commander will wait for players without mounts to speed up travel) but you'll come out the other side much better equipped for PoF.
---
Since we're going to extremes, what about the next potential scientist who will cure cancer, but can't because they're stuck at a minimum wage job and will never have any educational opportunities? 
---
Elementalist has been gutted over and over since release. Lost my will to play it years ago, even when it was my main character for a long time.
---
You're deliberately ignoring what I'm saying. No thanks.
---
I think I've heard the WoW dev team has about 200 people, but that's of course not everyone involved with the game as that number doesn't include thinks like QA, CS, or marketing.
---
Oh look, NCSoft cutting out more of the non-mobile market from it's portfolio of companies. Is anyone at all surprised?
---
It's high time companies like ArenaNet sought suitors to buy them out from under the guillotine.
---
This has literally always been the case except perhaps post-LFR in WOW. I'm speaking as someone who ran multiple expansions of a mid tier progression guild (fast for our server, but not a high pop server), but raids are elitist bullshit. Even before we consider play style preference, most players are either not good enough to play them, or don't have a premade. Raiders generally bitch if something isn't like swallowing scorpions for a PUG with modest entry requirements.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also, ANet's decision to not include a DPS meter (and more!) in game is terrible. Players using the default UI in this game and WOW do not get enough feedback to get good. Raid leaders have to use a fucking dowsing rod to figure out why they are wiping instead of having hard data like in WOW. As someone who has spent a few hundred in gems in addition to base + expansions, the "blind eye" approach to DPS meters doesn't sit well with me, especially after ANet completely fucked up on previous ban waves, catching huge numbers of innocent people.
---
Mobile stuff probably?
---
I would only pay a sub if they get someone new in charge of direction. Whoever has been making the calls for what should or shouldn't be added to the game has done so much damage to the game. At this point we need to hire Yoshida to turn GW2 around.
---
First instinct tells me to prepare for p2w model.  
---
Putting that fear aside I can only hope those 400 people were working on cancelled projects.
---
yes ... i still dont get why anet is still so blind regarting managing their ressources.
---
they could be so more efficient if they use the same map for like 2-3 ls episodes or use an older map so they can put in more work into them over time

It's end-game capitalism. And it makes 100% sense.
---
If you invest in a business, you don't get a return unless the business grows.
---
You have many public investors, you better grow the business. If you don't, they freak the fuck out and pull their money to put it someplace else. It's all growth. It doesn't matter how big you are now. You have to become *bigger* or they don't benefit. Keeps going until investors lose their mind and you can reset expectations.
---
Yeah it became a meme I think.

In case the bot is slow:
---
&gt;We know you have a lot of questions about the future of Guild Wars 2. We want to share with you what to expect moving forward for the game. First and foremost, we are still fully committed to all of our players and ongoing support of the game. We will be moving directly from Living World Season 4 into Season 5 as promised, and we plan to continue a regular cadence of updates and releases.
---
&gt;We know Guild Wars 2 is important to you, and as our players, you are important to us. Rest assured that we are still working to add great new content to the game. We are deeply grateful to all of you for your support during this difficult time.
---
Good to see they gave a quick answer.
---
&gt; Enemies doing fire damge are often insane. 
---
That fire elemental HP at the thaumanova reactor... just... argh.
---
Likely the only they will be working on for a while. Doubtful any other projects are going to be supported after this. 
---
I'm sure I'll continue to get down-voted for pointing out factual innaccuracies here, but no defintion of "debate" in any of the major English dictionaries mention the requirement of a moderator to be involved.  A debate is a discussion involving opposing viewpoints in a public forum, of which this does qualify as an example, if a rather pathetic one.
---
If ArenaNet was indeed working on some sort of mobile title as has been rumoured, I can see these layoffs being mainly targeted at the people working on that project rather than the GW2 team.
---
For reference, Valve does everything they do with a total headcount of ~350. I could see GW2 keeping pace even with ANet downsizing, especially if the mobile game rumours are true.
---
Insecurity is huge in this sub
---
I hope that’s the case too. I’m just afraid they will steer in the direction of mobile games and neglect PC games. I myself wouldn’t mind paying for more content - Living world for example if that can keep the game going.
---
I only do PvP. 
---
Mechanics are quite good, gamemode is fun, worth enough to spend countless hours.  
---
People are talking bad about it because: 
---
- Player base is small, therefor 'daed game'.
---
- Balance issues. 
---
- Lack of content. 
---
I thought that claim was around before Carbine.  It's been a long time, I don't have perfect recall.
---
for f\*\*king hellish sake. I just came back to this game, after playing only vanila (before Hot), got my 80 boost... FINALY finished personal story and making my way through living world... AND NOW I SEE THIS. RIGHT AFTER I STOPPED PLAYING WOW IN NOVEMBER! What the hell with mmorpg market right now?! 
---
Read my above post. Stop this negative bullshit posting. 
---
I guess I’ll do my part and buy some gems, if only to try and support them during this. 
---
Am I the only one who would have bought it if it had stayed compact?
---
Lets be honest with 400+ employees they where way overstaffed for how slow they are at actually releasing products.
---
https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-02-21-arenanet-reportedly-bracing-for-mass-layoffs
---
Read everything
---
Dungeons. A path is almost your entire exp bar
---
They may not even KNOW the names. Don't you think they'd rather hear the news from inside their own company than from a Kotaku article?
---
Not for the content they put out
---
Oh god lol
---
The 400 figure is what they are at now - I guess GW2 kicked off with far less.
---
If the game has to go forward, shedding all these extra projects, with less employees, for it to remain going then that's whats got to happen I guess.
---
Kralkatorrik can easly get into mists and this is where Gods are currently (if they didn't found new world yet).
---
from jessica price twitter:  
---
&gt; The article doesn't go into detail, because I doubt they're interested in releasing details to the public, but it does mention canceled projects. Anet had two major projects in the works when I was there. One was indefinitely suspended while I was still there.  
---
&gt; For those of us working on GW2, our mandate was essentially to make it look like there was the same level of resources devoted to GW2, when they were actually steadily moving people off of it onto the other projects.  
---
...big OOF
---
I wish those who will be laid off the best but I  hope Mike is getting the boot, too. 
---
This quick response makes sense. It was getting out of control, too much speculation going on about the future of the game.
---
When I read "Lily of the Elon" my brain always adds "Musk" to the end.  
---
... What is this message and why did they make it?
---
Not trying to be rude but I don't understand the context.
---
Wow now I'm terrified
---
Worse probably was their unhealthy fixation on becoming an E-Sport. They have tried to push that for 5 years, which likely cost millions, and in the end had to give up on it.
---
I know what you mean. Hearing about this is making me really depressed. I love this dumb game with all my heart, flaws and all, and I really don't know what I would do without it. Blegh. :(
---
If I remember correctly they drop from Silverwaste Chestfarm which is great as you will make gold at the same time you receive spirit shards, as loot for opening the chests. Other than that you can buy them for fractal currency from one of the fractal vendors and it is quite cheap. You can also buy Obsidian shards from the fractal vendor there instead of using a ridiculous amount of karma which is also needed for your legendary. :)
---
With our dragon dead or weakened to the point of nothing... the gods returning to deal with the dragon and perhaps restore some sort of balance...hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
---
Need to make room for the gods.
---
They know what they're doing is non-sustainable. That's accounted for.
---
Investors don't love companies, they love money. Liquidating companies gives them money.
---
Yea I guess so. I'm not trying to be dramatic, but one of the big reasons I decided to start playing GW2 was that the game appeared to be doing well and releasing content. I guess im just bummed at the prospect that I might put effort into the game only for the game to stop being developed or in the relatively near future be shutdown.
---
Thanks for posting her response directly. She blocked this rando asshat 
---
&gt; Which is, of course, how this always goes. They'll keep failing upward, as male game execs do, and the people who poured their lives and souls into making something they loved will struggle. 
---
Ah, Jessica.
---
Based on a post on twitter from JP, it appears that ANet leadership was basically giving up and moving on from GW2. From her tweets:
---
&gt; The article doesn't go into detail, because I doubt they're interested in releasing details to the public, but it does mention canceled projects. Anet had two major projects in the works when I was there. One was indefinitely suspended while I was still there.
---
&gt; For those of us working on GW2, our mandate was essentially to make it look like there was the same level of resources devoted to GW2, when they were actually steadily moving people off of it onto the other projects.
---
&gt; It was bad enough that at one point we were told we could only have one cinematic for Ep5 (All or Nothing), which, given that it was the climax of the season and had more heavy emotional beats than anything else we'd done (at least while I was there), was devastating.
---
&gt; The cinematics team, which is amazing, eventually figured out how to give us the cinematics we needed, and the team got very creative about how to do those sort of emotional beats without cinematics (like the last scene, which came out brilliantly). 
---
&gt; But it was deeply stressful to have to keep up the appearance of the same level of content creation and production values as always while people steadily got moved off the project.
---
So it very much sounds like ANet leadership was moving on from GW2 and setting up LWS5 to be the end and then maintanence mode and just focusing on gem store stuff to keep a little money flowing in. As far as the other games go, she mentions one of the other games was cancelled. Now the question is with these layoffs, is GW2 going to be hit, or is NCSoft just going to say forget the other game and work on GW2. Depending on how far the other game was along it could be either way.
---
With this statement we're at least being promised Season 5 but yeah I don't have high hopes right now. Unless NCSoft is forcing ANet to kill their other projects and go all in with GW2 I have a feeling that GW2 will go into maintenance mode in 2020 when LWS5 is completed, assuming we even get there but the game is still making enough money that I expect they will finish it off at the very least and then just depends on how expensive maintenance is.
---
wait... i thought raids were meant to be harder content than fractals? im not getting good drops from fractals because im only low tier
---
Continuing into S5 is encouraging, and seems to support the theory that the lay-offs are probably largely impacting people working on other projects that *aren't* GW2.
---
As I said in the other thread, Valve does everything they do with a headcount of ~350, while ArenaNet are said to have a headcount of 400. To my mind that seems to indicate that ANet are overstaffed for their visible output.
---
If anything, now would be a good time for ANet to re-evaluate their release cadence, and consider if the 3-monthly interval is really the best way to keep players engaged with the game. (And thus more likely to making purchases) 
---
GW3 though, and imagine  if they picked up EverQuest Next's mantle!
---
I thought they gave up on pushing it several years ago? What were they doing recently to push for it?
---
There have been cases where a developer bought itself free from a publisher. Bungie for example. But it's true that it's not something you should realistically hope for.
---
They own the GW2 IP though.
---
Yeah, and the Roller Beetle almost got translated "Scarabée de croisière" ("Cruising scarab") before getting its GW1 (better) translation, "Scaraboule" ("Scaraball") ... so,... yeah ...
---
&gt;merging ArenaNet and NCSoft’s publishing divisions in the process
---
Aww man, this is very sad.
---
The LS5 stuff is exactly what drives me anxious. Anet I beg you, just tell us if there's anything beyond that, and what prevented you from shipping LS5 as an expansion. That potentially would've saved everything money-wise.
---
Were = past tense. 
---
That's not what they said.  They said the game SERVICES would not be affected and no future planned content was being cancelled.  That's a far cry from saying the games will not be affected in any way.
---
Fanboys: "How dare you raise your concerns, you should stop being so entitled. This is the greatest game ever and if you don't enjoy the game just quit."
---
Also Fanboys: "What the fuck why are we getting season 5 and not an expansion? Why does this game feel like it's going into maintenance mode?"
---
I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack golems on fire off the shoulder of Anzalias. I watched ballista shots glitter in the dark near the SMC Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.
---
Numbers? I said nothing of numbers. 
---
Not to be a douche, but is buying gems really going to help Anet? Isn't the money going straight to NCSoft?
---
They kinda let GW2 go dry for a long time because they were funding Wild Star, and when that flopped they went back to sustain GW2 and that's when we started getting LS and stuff.
---
Oh wow it is, I didn't even notice that. I thought I looked at that image too.
---
The fractal one sounds like an interesting try out, to be honest i'm good on karma and gold but thanks!
---
Regurgitating asinine memes doesn't make them true.
---
A lot of games create a lot of prototypes that never see the light of day.
---
The video game bubble is finally popping again like it did it 87 thats all, it has been a long time coming.
---
Only if they provide **regional pricing** (like Steam does). Otherwise if you're outside of US and EU, exchange rates make almost any cost prohibitive.
---
Idk if she's worth trusting, to be fair...
---
Too slow, a dungeon takes what 10-15 min-ish and istan is atleast 1 spirit shard every 5 ish min 
---
Yikes, she does like to type a lot
---
Can't stress this enough. There should be a separate thread requesting the transparency we all deserve for our financial and emotional investments.
---
No. I'd switch over to FFXIV, because why would I play GW2 otherwise?
---
It's not a rumor, Jessica Price actually tweeted about this an hour ago:
---
[https://twitter.com/Delafina777/status/1098736620780441600](https://twitter.com/Delafina777/status/1098736620780441600)
---
To be fair, I'm not sure if JP's tweets on the matter are to be trusted.
---
aye. enjoy the cat, because it's the last thing wvw is going to get.    
---
RIP alliances.  
---
It's a risk we all take when choosing to play an MMO but it is very shocking with GW2 as it is constantly on the top lists of games and is still very profitable. I've never seen any details on how much money Star Trek Online makes but the game is 2 years older than GW2 on an even older engine and yet is still chugging along just fine. Granted it is in a much more unique space than Guild Wars 2 as people have WoW, ESO, and FF14 to fill the fantasy genre but if STO can still have a massive team working on it plugging away at new content nearly every month I don't understand why GW2 struggles so much.
---
I love this game and I don't want to see it go either. I hope that it won't go that way. 
---
450k is not a lot of money, and they have easily made that back since with other investments. 
---
If you think the current gw2 situation could have in any way been saved by spending those 450k from the marketing budget on more taxi ads you are wrong.
---
Gw2 is, just as the article says, seeing the current issues due to a slow release schedule where the company hasn't released anything widely marketable since 2017. Sales are steadily dropping as people leave for newer games. 450k cannot buy an expansion or even a living world episode. It can't pay more than 5-6 employees salaries for a year.
---
We kind of already saw that happen surrounding the lead-up to HoT and PoF with how the Living World releases were structured. That felt bad enough. It feels worse knowing this could also be a thing since it wasn't even directly for this game.
---
Not encouraging at all given GW2 is being given less and less resources and that will undoubtedly continue.
---
Fucking lmao
---
Let us buy LS5...
---
That didn't seem likely even before this.
---
Hardly. They were the go to support spec until PoF released and before HoT they were the best all rounders by a large margin. 
---
mmos are a dying breed. Hell, PC gaming's future doesn't look great.
---
....gw2 heading to retirement home faster than previously imagined....
---
DD ele in pvp was amazing amounts of fun before it got buffed to hell that simplified it. 
---
Confusion is the reason 
---
1. You cannot glide in enemy territory.
---
2. The capture circle that appears after *allied* guards get killed is for enemy players. They're right behind you! Haha, kidding. These circles do not need "re-capping" until an enemy guard appears.
---
3. To deny the most points from an enemy team when flipping camps, wait to cap the camp just before tick.
---
4. 100% of flipping camps is knowing where to stack, watch a guide.
---
5. Guards, camp soldiers, and supervisors respawn every two minutes when left uncapped.
---
6. Supervisors have a buff that makes them unkillable gods for five minutes after capture, DO NOT ENGAGE if they have this buff. Said buff can be double-checked by hovering over camps on the minimap.
---
7. In order for towers and keeps to be upgraded, supply dolyaks need to be escorted from camps. This gives your team waypoints and is super helpful.
---
8. WvW has two effective reward tracks, one which lasts forever and is repeatable, and another which is reset weekly, referred to as "pips". Participation in WvW gives increasing progress in reward tracks, but will have a timer ticking down since the last time you earned points for your team.
---
9. You cannot capture Borderlands Bloodlust (ruins) on your own. If your group goes to capture it, split up.
---
10. Mithril and Orichalcum tools are not recommended for resource nodes as the rewards will be random (gold and silver ore, yuck). Anything below these will yield more worth.
---
11. Map chat != team chat, so reply accordingly.
---
12. Have fun! :D
---
Message &gt; Messenger. Please.
---
&gt; They are confirm-ably not fully committed.
---
Gonna take concrete, transparent numbers on who did what and info on what those project were to dissuade the community.
---
&gt;when they were actually steadily moving people off of it onto the other projects.
---
What other projects? Goddanmit. I want to know. 
---
I don't understand you have this golden gouse that is Gw2 and its playerbase and instead of focusing on making the top MMORPG in the west that can easily achieve you instead take away more and more resourced off of it to make other projects? 
---
I can although accept that those projects are related to gw3. 
---
Of course Investors are upset; why spend anything on GW2 when mobile games are bringing in 800m/year in comparison, or lineage/B&amp;S which is outpacing per quarter? On simple ROI, GW2 just isn't bringing in as much.
---
Sure, but the sliver of hope is now basically extinguished, and that's probably true of any non-major project, so I'd expect minimal development on the annual festivals as well.
---
It aint Peter Principle's for no reason xD
---
Why shouldn't they? It wouldn't benefit her in any way to lie about this thing. Ofc I won't blindly believe everything I read online, yet I don't see why she should not be telling the truth - benefit of the doubt :)
---
Are you saying that Mike isn't male?
---
Well, that's a bigger fish to fry than such a simple statement.
---
For example, not everyone in management is meant to be there (see: the peter principle) and from there, people see everything as an experience. If you fail, it's an experience and you've (ideally) learned from it.
---
It's the same reason why investors will back someone who's failed every time over someone who has never tried.
---
From there, it's a matter of selling yourself and your experiences. If you dwell on the fact that you failed, then you set yourself up to never move on.
---
Gender typically has very little to do with it, and making that argument brings up a can of worms so large it has cans of worms inside of it. You have to consider that, psychologically, men and women have different attitudes in the workplace. You have to consider the percentage of people who get promoted to management, the percentage of people in management, the percentage of men and women in positions capable of being in management (and compare that to the previous percentages). Then, if you want to go to the argument of: "well, there's a lot more men in ____ industry than women", then you'll need to consider the amount of men versus women *trying to get into that industry*.
---
It's why the idea of gender inequality in terms of pay is both true and false. Two people doing the same thing might make different amounts, regardless of gender. It could be due to their output, throughput, personality, tenure, location, past experiences, or other terms, negotiated or otherwise. You could have the same title as someone else but actually be doing less (important) work and therefore compensated less.
---
Without us actually knowing the environment at Anet, it's not really fair to assume that it's a toxic masculine environment.
---
Yeah, rereading the Price tweets now it seems fairly clear that the implication is that the projects being worked on were *not* GW2. If that's the case, one of those projects was likely some kind of mobile game (all those mobile hires), and I can't guess at what the other might have been.
---
I take everythinh that price is saying with a lot of salt. But hearing there was something developed AND canceled, doesn't really sit well. 
---
&gt; I find it incredibly irresponsible and disgusting that management warned about the layoffs, but then didn't give any extra information?
---
It's more common practice than you think.
---
Bit worse than that, they announced layoffs FROM Anet, they're not just "affected" as if they were just caught in the crossfire.
---
The staff are being laid off not internally transferred. GW2 is an older game with a monetisation model that is suspect, I can't see them putting greater resources back into GW2 at this stage.
---
The best thing they could do would be to cancel season five or at least shorten it, and bring a new expansion by at least the first or second quarter of 2020. The announcement of S5 directly following S4 seemed to be what got the community worried in the first place. They'd have to shake up the story a bit, but I'd imagine they were working on expansion three by now anyways if they were planning one at all. Living World on its own just isn't enough to keep people interested in the long term.
---
Honestly getting prepared for another CoH.... NCSoft doesn't have a good track record in the west.
---
blizz-layoffs were marketing and PR and they stated actual game developers would be kept. 
---
Anet, in an attempt to throw a cheeky jab at activision-blizzard, offered DEV positions (which is no use to the layoffs from act-blizz)
---
They barely blew anything on e-sports, it was a pittance and most of it was put up by sponsors.
---
If you want to look for money wasting, look no further than Living Story 1 that drained resources from every other part of the game on temporary content.
---
But then beyond that, simply wake up to what they were doing, which was steadily moving people off GW2 on to other projects, with the obvious results of that for GW2.
---
I've seen it quite a few times. Mostly on weeks where we're winning so bad we don't care to cap the objective. A few times we'd knock down all of SMC's outer walls, and inner gates and just leave, did it for the luls.
---
If they're developing other games it makes sense though. It takes a long time and a lot of people to make a new game from scratch. The GW2 folks might be like half of that for all we know.
---
No, but she is right.  The executives won't suffer.  The devs will.  The execs will fail upwards, or escape with a golden parachute, and the devs, who actually do work hard to give us the game we love, will apparently get 2 months severance, and that's it.  Why do executives get golden parachutes, and the devs get the anxiety of having to find a job before 2 months are up?
---
Beginning of the end.
---
We found the bigot!
---
&gt;Shes not right either.
---
She absolutely is.
---
noooooooobody cares about that shit give it a rest
---
Given that they were working on multiple other flagship projects, I can't agree that ~400 is absurd here given output. These projects + GW2 teams being considerably small apparently + still releasing living story/huge balance and feature updates multiple times a year; ~400 lines up pretty nicely with other MMO studios currently alive. 
---
This is blind speculation, but it may not have been ArenaNet's choosing. We saw a lot of mobile dev hires over the past couple of years and it doesn't seem out of the realm of possibility that NCSoft was pushing them to make a mobile game since it's where the big whale bucks are at.
---
Other, even more tin-foil-hat ideas are that they were moved to create something that's recently gone bust - a MOBA (which are now being eclipsed by Battle Royale) or a TCG (which is not a good place to be after Artifact failed).
---
Let’s be honest here, you have no idea if she’s lying here or in the past. You’re basing this entirely on your opinion of her character, not on any actual knowledge of what is going on inside ANet. Unless Anet produces some kind of factual info to prove or disprove what she says, we have no real way of knowing what the truth is for sure.
---
At least one was for sure a mobile game. ANet had hiring posts for mobile developers. 
---
I hope to got they stop wasting resources with that stupid 1 map per episode thing
---
Yeah we said times and times again the problem with the class to forums and here but devs only nerfed and nothing to give eles a chance to complete. Even yolo builds like full dmg staff don't do shit at current metas with all dodges/invuln/etc crap. 
---
Assuming I could comfortably afford it and it would lengthen the longevity of the game updating w/ quality content, sure. Question comes down to pricing &amp; whether or not I can justify it in my expenses.
---
I guess if a lot of players have been buying gems then surely NCSoft would have recognized that the game is making big money, and thus would have given more resources them to make even more.
---
If sudden changes to monetization, like a sub fee, would actually increase revenue, surely NCSoft would have to adjust to that.
---
imagine if fortress of gandara was actually worked upon with all resources...
---
kinda feels like as much effort that went into each episode makes you wonder what actually could have been produced  if maximum effort was used.
---
also I thought they said they found a way for episodes to be produced at a faster rate, I wonder how shortly after that resources was taken from the teams...
---
Nonsense. Necro has always been good in wvw sure, but ele water fields and staff control skills were always invaluable. Necro was a core source of dps but not control or support.  
---
DD ele was great for 4 maybe 5 years with celestial amulet long before the specialization update. The only real counter to it was lockdown marauder engi until celestial necro became a thing and even then everyone ran at least one DD ele. 
---
[Check this thread for a transcript of her tweets.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/atb65p/rumor_arenanet_has_been_pouring_resources_from/)
---
Well, that's very concerning, but to anyone that just wants to rush home and go buy gems I just wanna say that, I doubt that will actually do anything. From the last earning reports the game itself seems to be doing fine and its NCSoft doing the layoffs and I'm sure they couldn't care less about a few thousand dollars in gem purchases lol. I just really hope they can maintain the game. Because if the cadence changes AGAIN and becomes longer than 3 months that it has been now, I don't think they will continue beyond season 5 because I feel like a lot of people really don't care to wait that long to get more story or even a new map and things to work on. Raids, Fractals, WvW, Pvp already seem to be sooooo slow on updates and anything longer on PvE stuff will just break the game, because, as we all know, PvE is what keeps this game going. 
---
It makes a profit - these other projects Anet were working on (and have now been cancelled) don't.
---
What else is their to do other than close the studio?
---
No? Does bending stories to her own agenda count as trustworthy to you?
---
She says she's not happy about the situation, but then goes on to make it clear that she is in fact happy to see this happen, before trying to backpedal by "standing up for the people".
---
Sure, it's highly probable and more than likely that the team shrank to support other projects, but this is not something we needed confirmation on; this is is expected and how it normally works.
---
So much for all the people here who were shitting on Blizz the other week.
---
Episode 3? That's the one with Kourna and the unfinished Gandara. We learned soon after that many devs had been restructured. 
---
As good as always Dagos~
---
I love this game and the people I’ve met along the way since beta. No matter what this means in the future this game has had the most profound impact on my gaming life by far. Can’t fire that experience.
---
The problem is that MMOs are not a big deal these days. Lame battle royale is the latest hype - along with mobile "games". I'm afraid the companies will sell the players out :-(
---
The important parts of the message are only parts of the message. That data has context, and it can't be properly interpreted until it is situated within it. Because its relationship with the rest of the data, and whether or not that data seems useful, is still important. This guy isn't attacking the messenger, he's saying that the hostility contained in the rest of her rant colors the information included within it.
---
*However*, I would agree that for the most part it isn't necessary in this case, strictly speaking. We all know she has an axe to grind. There's not much more that her rant can inform us about her feelings towards Anet - these are known. I would only bother including something if it casts *further* doubt on the specific information she's offering. And we already know she's hostile towards men, so there isn't much point in including that.
---
That doesn't make any sense. If she's having a hard time finding work, ratting out your past employer DOES NOT make you more hirable. It does the exact opposite, it makes them never want to hire you because they fear you'll just also jump ship later on and spill the beans causing them trouble in the future. 
---
I believe that OP is referring to a series of posts which have been deleted by the mods making fun of the situation.
---
&gt;"We can confirm that due to the cancellation of unannounced projects, ArenaNet will make staff reductions," the statement reads. "This is part of a larger organizational restructuring within NCSOFT in the west, but the Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2 game services will not be affected, nor is any upcoming game content canceled."
---
Sounds like development on Anet's next game was going so poorly that it got cancelled altogether, and that made Papa NCSoft nervous.
---
CoF path 1 spam is about 5m/run
---
Silverwastes is probably the quickest.  Champ bags there (embroidered coin purses and noxious seed pouches) net me around 20-25 spirit shards per stack.
---
im on the opposide ... they should stop wasting resources with that stupid 1 map per episode and use their assets better instant of just throwing them away (they could have made some dungeons of instants etc.)
---
If that was supposed to sound positive, they failed.
---
Can someone explain to me why anet is controlled by NCSoft and why can't they give them the middle finger and become independent and release their content on say steam? Frontier Developments in the UK made the rollercoaster tycoon 3 game shipped under Atari. Atari wouldn't let them develop the things the fans asked for so they went to steam and parted ways with Atari. Why can't anet do the same?
---
Possibly, but if gw2 is giving a steady revenue in gems then regardless of where that money is going, it shows that the game is still profitable and still worth investing to NCSoft. (Or at least that's our hope)
---
The problem is they don’t even have much information my the sounds of it. It’s NCSoft making the calls on this one, which leaves me more worried than at first.
---
Valve still does plenty of development... Go take a look at their GitHub. Most of their work is in backend tooling right now than games, which is probably why it doesn't look like they are doing a lot
---
LW5 could be a transition to a sequel, or just the recycled scraps of a cancelled third expansion.
---
&gt; There has been a ton of content created for GW2 that has been scrapped. For some reason Anet loves to scrap almost everything they make. It really shows you how bad the leadership is there.
---
Not really. This is quite known and happens often. 
---
What does the "publishing" part implies ? Is it things like strategic decision, marketing... etc ? As opposed to game designers/narrative/art... ?
---
 I don't know a thing about game companies.
---
That's not how layoffs work. You should know that the announcement of the layouts MUST come out first, due to the WARN Act, followed by the details after the cooling off period the WARN Act requires.
---
So no, not out of context. Providing you with further information for your education of why it is done this way.
---
You are free to believe whatever you like, as am I. 
---
She acted incredibly shitty to this community in the past, blowing everything up to such an insane degree that at best she isn't trustworthy about what she is saying.
---
Anything she has to say about GW2 is tainted by her experiences, as you can see in the message herself. I have talked to numerous devs in the past about what working at ANet is like, and not a single one of them have ever made it even seem *remotely* like how she describes working there is like. 
---
I'm much more likely to trust the devs I was friendly with and what they say compared to a known shit disturber who got fired for being vocally shitty to the community at large, and turns EVERYTHING into a gender-based argument.
---
So much for all the people here who were shitting on Blizz the other week. It's not like NCSoft was going bankrupt either.
---
Sorry, I know that almost the whole community started flaming her to death, but I for one was totally able to understand her point of view (even though her wording was ... well ... not okay) &amp; I don't think this ongoing hatred and malice towards her is acceptable. We don't know whether she already got a new job or not, neither is it our business. I also don't think that the heads at Anet are angels; welcome to capitalism - basically almost everyone who's head of a company is a d*ckhead. Hard to swallow pill, but it is as it is. Seeing how Jennifer Scheurle is posting publicly about important topics like feminsim on twitter it seems like it's okay for the devs at Anet to post stuff like this (just as JP said and did &amp; still she was punished for it).
---
Like I already said; I don't think her wording and behaviour was okay; still I was and am shocked due to the ongoing hatred she receives; there are more important matters out there to direct your energy to - but pls let's not fight over this rn; I really don't have the emotional capacity for yet another sh*tshow rn - tyvm! In conclusion: I believe her on this topic. You don't have to, that's up to you and it's fine - but I do :) 
---
&gt; So this sounds as if all of the non-guild wars projects are being killed off as they were going no where and that staff being let go as they are no longer needed.
---
Sure but all of those people were GW2 people who had gotten moved to teams working on the unannounced games. Now they're getting fired after those projects failed instead of being moved back to GW2. Definitely not good for GW2.
---
One on a level 21-35 map. JP chest often give Doubloons and currently the most valuable one is Silver at 1g. (IIRC the high cost is due to a Legendary Journey requirement.)
---
Obsidian Shards should be purchased with unbound magic, every one of your characters can snag about 13 or so shards worth of UM per day with Bitterfrost Frontier alone.
---
Amen. 
---
She can't be trusted (mind you some points could be true) and i'm sure this is her way of turning the community against this franchise. For somebody who praises her old co-workers and wishes them the best, it sure sounds like she wants the entire company to suffer and fire everyone so that she feel's better about her dumbass self being fired for not shutting up on social media. 
---
Somebody like that is somebody who shouldn't be employed by ANYBODY because all they will bring is negativity and bad karma.
---
MMORPGs in general are dying out now thanks to the money milking machines mobile games are
---
You shouldn't have mentioned it was her, 70%  of people will go monkey.exe and only talk about her personality once again, as if that is the thing that matters right now. 
---
Apart from her (sadly unavoidable) feminazi outbursts, she did and does provide some rational and intriguing insight into her work at the company. 
---
They are owned by NCSOFT.
---
Cheers!
---
GW2 is 7 years old. I would be absolutely shocked if Arenanet hadn't already started working on their next game/franchise at least 1-2 years ago.
---
What's not surprising is that that work went so poorly the game got cancelled altogether.
---
If you're gonna sacrifice anything, sacrifice the story instances instead of the new zones.
---
That's the same with phylacteries, are there more champs in SW?
---
there isnt even a name under the statement. thats so poor damage control
---
Will try
---
The Blizzard employee's that got laid off weren't devs.
---
That was my point, as while it's not been officially confirmed that ArenaNet was working on other projects, their output for GW2 did not match up to their headcount. Furthering my supposition that the layoffs are going to principally affect people working on said other projects, rather than GW2.
---
Now ask yourself, how many are saying that because they're either ignoring all the issues the game has or are looking at this situation with rose-tinted glasses?
---
That's the thing. The game makes a profit.
---
From what I'm reading though, in the various articles, is that a lot of resources and devs, were being redirected by Anet to these 'other projects'.
---
And if you believe one of the previous devs, the remaining employees on GW2 were keeping up the front of no change.
---
If that's the case this, ot could be a situation where these other projects, which went no where and were just a big suck on resources - and presumably cash also - have come close to killing the main game of Anet.
---
If so MO may need to go. Anet should just focus on GW2 and no be bled dry by side projects which generate no profit and only drain resources.
---
This is it here, Arenanet needs to see that their work brings joy to the countless few of GW2.  Personally, the thought of this game not being maintained to it's fullest is  a true tragedy.
---
@Arenanet , big goals draw you forward.  I challenge you to start planning to take a large playerbase from WoW. (The good ones of course, we can leave the WoW toxicity in Wow xD)
---
I'm drowning in anything but spirit shards that's why I created the post :) Already have stacks upon stacks of obsidian.
---
She is right. Look at Activision-Blizzard. Lay off 800 employees while giving their (male) CFO a $15 million bonus.
---
Well, where's the guy who said people were exagerating when people said Anet was in a tough financial spot and the game was fine, and proceeded to make memes with birds about it?
---
&gt;  For some reason Anet loves to scrap almost everything they make.
---
Their management is fundamentally incompetent so most of the content produced is broken beyond repair.
---
Can't blame her for hating a community that sent death threats to her. Sorry; the communitys' reaction was as unacceptable as her comments towards Deroir back then.
---
Why should you warn someone who's not getting fired though? You're fearmongering the whole company. Just say who's getting fired upfront.
---
It barely cost them anything, the entire prize money was in the hundreds of thousands, there was virtually no advertising, etc.
---
It's Anet, this has always been their hardest issue: communication.
---
At this point I wouldn't be surprised if NCSoft is planning to axe the game, the fact that it did as much revenue as Aion is bad with capital B.
---
What do you mean? They were movinga significant number of their employees off of GW2 and onto a new project, and now that project is being cancelled and (at least some of) those people are being laid off. Not returning to GW2 development. Dunno how you can spin that at all as positive.
---
400 employees and they can’t manage to create more content like raids new pvp game modes or maps oh forgot about dungeons to, man 400 people that has been lazy as a sleeping cat
---
Basically, these side projects which ultimately generated no profit but just drained resources and devs, have almost killed GW2.
---
Someone needs to be held responsible surely?
---
why would anyone think a sub fee would change anything for us for the better? Ultimately NCSoft decides on Anets funding and "pocket money". Gw2 isn't doing too bad, it had the same amount of revenue it does right now before already. 
---
It's NCSoft that decided to cut costs. Your sub money would just be shoveled into their throats and Anet and Gw2 would probably still not get much more funding for the game and their products. 
---
But does it make a big enough profit? This news is not just the layoffs, its NCSoft taking greater control of Anet and probably insisting on more intrusive monetisation.
---
They may need time to figure it out for themselves before being able to tell us anything.
---
I just wish people would stop giving any form of attention to this narrow-minded delusional twat. She thrives off of negative energy with a big hate boner for all men.
---
They're not going to give us any information before they give their employees information
---
Turns out the birds were vultures, circling over a corpse :(.
---
I keep seeing this, but I SWEAR I read multiple times that when Arenanet decided to partner with NCSoft, they had some kind of clause that Anet retained full ownership of the game, and could choose to break off anytime they wanted.
---
Yeah, when they've made more money then ever, they still lay people off.
---
In 7 hours. 
---
I don't like JP but I don't think she's lying, she doesn't sounds salty about it nor she's jumping in excitement with Anet's closure; she sounds dead serious, even respectful about it.
---
Did you read the wiki? It's United States _law_. There are legal penalties for not announcing mass layoffs.
---
Not sure how to make this more obvious as to why there would be an announcement head of the actual layoffs.
---
&gt; Can someone explain to me why anet is controlled by NCSoft and why can't they give them the middle finger and become independent and release their content on say steam?
---
The same reason why Blizzard can't break from Activison-Blizzard. Because they are owned by NCSoft.
---
So NCSoft isn't just the publisher... They are literally the parent company :-(
---
What does she have to lose at this point...
---
If it means that ANet will be 100% focused on GW2 instead of 33% splitting focus between 3 games then it might be a good thing overall.
---
We also don't know what types of people are being let go either. They may be people that are not necessarily needed on GW2 right now. I hate to say something like that because it's layoffs are always terrible but also just trying to hope that someway or another GW2 ends up better off because of this. But yeah the overall loss of talent I am sure is going to hurt no matter what.
---
&gt; Subs also encourage developers to stretch content out or add in a bunch of busy work, which I'm not into. 
---
thank god we don't have that.
---
The Activision method? Sure.
---
I just think they've diverted too many resources to these side projects, that have mode no money, and that aren't GW2 and now it bit them in the ass.
---
If what that dev said is true, then the slow ass content is now understandable. These side projects have put a huge suck on how much progit Anet is making.
---
Yeah, this is part of a far bigger picture. Way too much bullshit during these last 10 years, we went from full games with free editors to DLCs and lootboxes in less than a decade.
---
At least we still have the indies and Japan...
---
&gt; edit: NO company has ever grown/expanded due to layoffs....
---
After laying off 16% of its employee's in 2012 Blizzard grew by thousands of employees.
---
Hah I knew someone at 2K. I’m moving to the East coast though. Been unemployed for 9 months here on the West coast. I’m going to be going to school for Nursing. Gotta get out of this business eventually. 
---
I mean, yeah, we are entitled to our opinions about her and the things she says. You’re also entitled not to trust what she says. But telling others not to trust her because she’s lied in the past is basically making the claim that you know for sure she is lying. You don’t know that and no one else outside of ANet does either. 
---
From my understanding of the situation as it transpired, her attitude towards the community was already incredibly disdainful before any alleged death threats manifested. Her unacceptable treatment of Deroir and other members of the community was what begot the negative backlash in the first place.
---
While I agree that it makes sense to continue to hate a community after allegedly receiving death threats, you make it sound like the death threats were the source of her hate, which isn't quite true. She was already hateful before 99% of the community was even aware of her existence.
---
Both the people who would send people death threats and JP are born from the same type of persistent toxicity.
---
I am of the opinion that a new map every three months has diluted the game and shifted resources away from more nutritious content.
---
I miss City of Heroes... No game will ever fill that void.
---
From a marketing perspective, what ANET needs right now is a big exciting announcement to restore consumer confidence.  It’s all well and good to say “Guild Wars 2 will not be affected” but a marketing perspective, you absolutely need to “sell the message” that “Guild Wars 2 will not be affected”.  The best way to do that would be to announce something big and exciting such as the new expansion.  
---
I suspect this is why they announced the Warclaw mount (and the balance patch) the other day as the timing is “too perfect”.  They probably wanted to get consumers excited about a new updated before the bad news dropped.  The problem with this strategy is that the Warclaw (and the balance patch) are not particularly exciting updates.  The recent forum post does very little to restore consumer confidence either.  
---
This is one of the reasons why I think ANET needs to get rid of the Living Story business model ASAP.  Living Story updates don’t generate very much buzz in the media.  The Living Story is one of those things that confuses new users and it is very hard to market Living Story updates to prospective users.  The current version of the Living Story is completely different from the original season 1 version (because it didn’t work) so why continue to use the words “Living Story”?  Heck the Living Story updates are unstainable anyway from a software development perspective so ANET really need to come up with something new.  
---
Hrmph. Now I feel kinda miffed for buying the expansions for GW2 the other day. 
---
Yup.  If the objective is just general cost cutting (as opposed to cutting a specific business unit or product), it's not uncommon to see an early announcement that layoffs are coming.  Upper management has to figure out where/which areas to cut then pass it down the management chain until lower managers have to come up with names.  Then those names usually need to get approval up the chain.
---
Its something that happens a lot.  Just not for game developers but pretty much anything software or technology related, likely far more types too.
---
You sure are dense.
---
* Announce mass layoffs, but don't specify who's getting fired or not - WRONG.
---
* Announce mass layoffs, specifying who's getting fired - RIGHT.
---
Is it really that hard?
---
It being a brand new account is what gets me really worried. In the past we've always had a name and face to go with announcements, no matter how unpleasant they were. But it being a vague "ArenaNet Team" account does not bode well.
---
Pour one out for City of Heroes. 
---
If theyre pulling people off GW2 and cutting corners im dreading that gw2 is gonna enter maintenance mode after season 5.
---
Most of your champ bags are coming from lost bandit chests.  Finding an organized riba map where all the chests are being dug up is probably going to be a faster spirit shard farm than doing istan.
---
\*stated
---
I can't say this is too surprising. ANet is even worse than Blizzard at starting new projects and releasing them and GW2 hasn't done much in the way of expacs.
---
I absolutely love seeing devs on patch days. When Lunar New Year launched, I saw both [ArenaPet](https://imgur.com/nKW2f5J) and [a dev hanging out with Drooburt](https://imgur.com/Lsf91Zc). I always love seeing devs play the game they work so hard on!
---
[removed]
---
The game won’t shutdown, not anytime soon anyway. They said services for GW1/2 and planned future content aren’t being thrown away
---
of course it is when ncsoft already do half of their income with mobile and its  keep getting more
---
 mmorpg is slowinly dieing and only the big names are left
---
I personally would like to thank /u/anet-chelsea for all her hard work on the various graphics, but especially the legendary weapons. Knowing that she was one of the devs working on the gen 2 legendaries, I knew they were all going to be fantastic. As such, for all the LS episodes after the gen 2 torch, I always saved mats months ahead of time so I can craft one of her new awesome new legendaries on day 1 of release. Thank you!
---
This assumes there was an expansion being made.  As it stands, I am doubtful.
---
the implication would be the bulk of them are moved back to GW2, from how I read it. Price made it sound like the majority of development was going to these new projects, so if those projects are cancelled, then they let most of the teams there go and move the rest back to GW2.
---
It sounds like it would be completely neutral to GW2 at worst and a moderate boost to their development at best.
---
I know they own Anet. It's why I mentioned Paragon, which tried to buy the IP from NCSoft and instead got the whole studio closed down. Plus, saying they don't have the cash is pure assumption.  
---
NCSOFT own everything to do with Arena Net. Nobody that works there could take that name from them, even Mo. That would be like Maxis parting ways with EA, never gonna happen. 
---
This has nothing to do with corruption. It's literally the nature of investing.
---
You buy equity in a company. If the stock price goes up, you make money. If it goes down, you lose money.
---
It doesn't matter where the starting point is. No matter how successful you are now, investors want you to be *more* successful or they don't make a dime. Expectations keep going up and up until you reach a ceiling like Activision did, the shareholders lose their shit and dump stock, and they end up laying off a bunch of people and lowering expectations.
---
no it didnt
---
&gt;yet it's quite sustainable according to the latest quarterly repor
---
...It's making as much as Aion, if not less, I wouldn't call that sustainable.
---
/u/Anet_Jason
---
If you could pass on the love to Tirzah and Regina I'd appreciate it :)
---
Mobile gaming micro-transaction bullshit wins again.
---
&gt;Yoon added that the company plans to “cut costs across the organization” and restructure across the board, merging ArenaNet and NCSoft’s publishing divisions in the process.
---
This makes it sound like ArenaNet is getting shutdown completely as a company and any remaining employees will just be a project at NCSoft proper from now on.
---
Well, their marketing team decides to make advertisement campaigns using obscure bubble tea brands, I'm not surprised it came to this.
---
Alright, I see that you just can't read nor understand a relatively simple US law that NCSoft must follow.
---
That may be NCSoft's MO, to kill a competitor, but it burns a lot of goodwill. It's almost like some people want the game to go down. Why not hope for the best?
---
A larger game development company can't just live off 1 game.
---
Let's not overreact
---
I don't think the "side projects" killed GW2.
---
I think they "killed" GW2 to move onto those side projects.
---
If they tell you they will be done after LS5 then you will stop spending money on the gem store. There is no way they are going to tell you they are wrapping it up.
---
Thanks for your time and effort to put that together; it's really shocking to see someone being *that* unable to take criticism ... I mean; I also am someone who's quick to use the block button since I don't want to waste energy on people who're acting like scum online, but MMOINKS wasn't being douche-y or anything like that, and celebrating the death of someone isn't a sign of good taste neither ... hooo boy. Once again thanks for the input here!
---
Anet are not a partner with NCSoft, NCSoft owns them.
---
Merging the publishing is just the opposite of what Anet did when it split the publishing away from NCsoft a few years back.
---
It's just duplication of roles, so that's an easy saving and cut to make.
---
They should stop doing anything. It must be very tiring for them to work :c We, players and customers will surly find something to do. 400 employees isnt enough resources to do anything. 
---
New theory threads soon....ANet consumed Joko and gained his powers. This is just pre hype for GW3
---
full seasons are bundled and are cheaper than buying them one at a time, check in the gem store. one for season 2 and one for season 3
---
If you can agree to keep transphobic comments out of your replies.  But I doubt it.
---
Thank you! 
---
It's better than my company, which randomly laid off 7 people (we're much smaller than ANet) right after the holidays with no warning whatsoever. With some sort of warning, you're at least able to guess if you'd be laid off and start job hunting early.
---
Yep, Colossus requires 250 for the precursor.
---
How close is this to completion? o:
---
Hey, you were the one injecting gender into the conversation in the first place.
---
Not liking it that much now, am I right? ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
They do have ownership of the GAME itself, but they're still owned by NCSoft.
---
I don't either, it's my first one. I never liked the idea of them but this is fun.
---
Any credibility that woman had went out with her firing. I’m sure she’s got a bone to pick with anet and any chance to shit on them she’ll jump at. I’d take this thread with a pinch of salt or ignore it altogether.
---
&gt; Supervisors have a buff that makes them unkillable gods for five minutes after capture, DO NOT ENGAGE if they have this buff. Said buff can be double-checked by hovering over camps on the minimap.
---
Also keep in mind that Righteous Indignation (the buff) makes the supervisor/lord glow with blue fire and hit much harder, so there's even more incentive to not jump in there early.
---
Aside from that sentry posts turned to the enemy side will mark you for that team if you get close enough, if you see a "Marked" effect on yourself it will show you as an orange dot to the team you're marked by and they can see where you are until it fades, along with the effect making long stealths impossible.
---
And when you aggro the guards of an objective it starts a defense event for the team that owns it that lasts 2 minutes, and after the first 30 seconds the objective's icon changes to show swords as a warning to everyone that it's being attacked, so if you want to capture something quickly with less chance of interference make sure not to aggro the guards until you're ready to kill them fast.
---
Was so confused why my twitter was suddenly in a different language when I checked your link, you left the language translation code in the url.
---
There are facts to back up her statement in the quality of the releases.  Also look at the gaps between releases and the 8 month dry spell between LS endings and the expansions. While I personally don't think she is being professional at all (this is her career choice and shes nose diving in a burning blaze) I see no reason she would be lying about the development limits imposed from management. After all appearances are everything when it comes down to it for a public company. 
---
But hindsight I saw this coming right around when 'MO' jumped in the spotlight, as it was really F'in weird for the President of a gaming company who is a sub company of a parent to come out in the public to reassure the customer base that 'everything is A-OK'. 
---
This is really sad to hear. I love this game and the people working on it (besides those from the summer) seem to be really good people.
---
Right, but by adding "male" in front of "executives", it just shows she's twisting an observation on how executives get away with failing projects into something that fits her own personal agenda.
---
Layoffs? I haven't played GW2 in a year or so, but it is a game I leave and return to and I honestly thought it was doing fine :S
---
And I understand that. I remember when EPIC games said they wouldn’t shut down Paragon as well and then here we are. However, I hold some margin of faith in the reasoning that Guild Wars is already established and if they hypothetically vanished tomorrow, that would hurt their profits because I lack knowledge of what else NCSoft has that is making them money at the moment.
---
If you do this, some people will start looking for new work right away, and if they find it then that's so many people you don't need to lay off.
---
400 people aren't all developers. I'd be willing to bet less than half are devs.
---
been a guild wars player for almost 14 years. I've always played and enjoyed both games for so long that its taken over half my life...and now with this announcement i feel like hope has all but gone for me, I'm so anxious that they will take my life's passion from me.. its my lifes safe place. :(
---
me too. I cant lose this game! its everything to me
---
Thank you for fixing it, but now I know why this episode stirred the sub. Unfortunately, being a bit late to the party, I haven't played it yet :/
---
I was working at Paragon Studios when that happened. I'm sad that the game we were working on didn't see the light of day, or the updates we had planned for City of Heroes.
---
That is true, but from reading what she had to say, her heart is in the right place.  She wasn't doing this to poke a stick at someone, it was to sympathize with her former coworkers with what they have been, and are, going through.
---
Possibly.
---
Wild thought! NCsoft have saved GW2 by forcing Anet to focus just on GW2.
---
Hey, I can dream cant I?
---
Also, the newer iterations are by no measure bad games, they are just different, and as most other games (especially ones of the last decade or so) they have some technical issues. 
---
Because there is barely any consistency between the Final Fantasy titles, chances are your first one will mark your measuring stick for every title to come, and as they shift around, you might not like the result.
---
I personally started with FFX and FF12 more or less at the same time, so apart from the graphics I can deal with older titles (though FF7 aged horribly and I can't get over that), and FF13 was okay in terms of combat mechanics but the world, especially Grand Pulse, was just too empty for me. Haven't tried the sequels yet. 15 has an issue on my PC I'd like to fix, but the first area made a good impression on me.
---
non wvw player here... never said I hated the mount. 
---
GW2 isn't dead... WTF are you all talking about?
---
"We can confirm that due to the cancellation of unannounced projects, ArenaNet will make staff reductions,"
---
Could have very well been GW3 as well. Which they should be at least starting some planning work on unless they planned to get by like WoW with 1/10th the manpower. 
---
I've literally wanted the same things since 2015 and none of them have been addressed. Even just seeing semi regular updates to wvw would be enough to get me playing again, but instead we get a mount that will do nothing to improve fights.
---
should've posted this when HoT got released
---
You don't need perma swiftness if you're in a squad
---
But it sounds like the cuts to GW2 were to plow into these 'other projects.'
---
If Anet just now focus's on GW2, it's still making a profit, but wouldn't have these side projects sucking away resources.
---
We don't know what's happening. ArenaNet employees don't know what's happening. Maybe put a lid on the speculation for a few days until the details are known?
---
Wildstar suffered from a lot of confusion though. On top of that, I don't think subscription models are as popular as they were the new thing when WoW came out. I didn't understand why they didn't go the GW2 route and do a buy once set-up with micro-transactions. All I ever really heard about the game was praise for it's housing system. If it was an Animal Crossing type of MMO, that'd be great. For a combat-heavy, sci-fi/fantasy RPG, not so much.
---
My eyes were really drawn to that. I'll take a slap on the wrist if I can just call her a bitter bitch and wouldn't put it past her to twist things.
---
Agree with this. 
---
Can you find a female executive that works at Anet, then?  Also, executives get away with failing projects nearly all the time.  And executives are overwhelmingly (and it seems exclusively at Anet) male.  I don't see why you're trying to make the executives in the company the good guys here.
---
So NCsoft saved GW2? Praise NCsoft! 
---
/s
---
93,2% did :(
---
Well yu know some of the more vocal minority were like "FIRE WHOEVER THOUGHT OF WVW MOUNTS"
---
Don't say Anet doesn't listen to the playerbase.
---
In Wayfarer Foothills, there is an event that is, " [Stop the enraged jotun from crushing the Bear shrine](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stop_the_enraged_jotun_from_crushing_the_Bear_shrine) (3) " . I've played this game awhile and leveled here quite a few times, but does this event still happen? I've never once seen it. Only reason I know about it is going through the events list on the wiki page for the map.

You go to every siege in an objective and press F so their one hour long despawn timer gets reset. 
---
I've already stopped. Last time I poured in some cash was in August, normally I'm willing to support the game and I've done so many times (to the point where I'm afraid to know the amount spent over the years) but recently I simply haven't been feeling like current content output deserves my money.
---
I have a bad feeling about this... They start mentioning the Gods again right when we figure out that season 5 may be the last season. It doesn't bode well for the longevity of the game sadly that they’re (huge assumption) trying to answer some of the major questions about the franchise:(
---
Yeah, I mean, every time I mount, I want to see a random skin.  More of an incentive to collect skins.
---
Fair enough. 
---
Just to summarize my view is the government is encouraging behaviors like companies downsizing just to increase stock value by laws and tax loop holes. I believe they do this for monetary kickbacks which they conveniently passed laws to make legal. Finally I think having the government pick winners and losers actually stifles innovation and competition and results in "late stage capitalism" where the worker is shit on.
---
Yes if a business went down people would be temporarily be out of a job but if there was still a hole in the market don't you think something else would come along to fill it? Did the end of the horse and buggy era mean the end of transportation or did it open the way for new businesses to flourish? How about people moving away from pagers, land lines, cable tv, or main stream media? Do you think we'd have a service like Netflix if the government had decided that Blockbuster was too big to fail back in the day?
---
I met people from NCSoft at a gaming event once and they didn't even know what most of their games were.
---
&gt; I'm specially worried about this, since it could mean GW2 has already been on maintenance mode for a long time. It could also explain why the latest releases have been so weak, almost like there weren't that many developers left.
---
I have to strongly disagree on this. Yes, the maps could've had much more meaningful Meta Events, but overall the latest releases have been the best in the whole Living world history of releases. We got:
---
* a new mount
---
* lots of new achievements and collections
---
* a beautiful armor set that is akin to the Legendary Raid Armor 
---
* two amazing Weapon sets
---
* a Lore-filled special home instance
---
* the best Story execution so far in a LW Season ( they even made us care about Braham again, which was near impossible ) and lots of people started to care
---
* 2 beautiful Raids
---
* 3 Fractals ( can't pronounce on their quality, I didn't play the much )
---
* partially remade Festivals
---
Now, I do agree we could've had a more steady pacing and even more content, but this Season is absolutely much more filled with content than the previous ones. Yeah, most content is done in 2 weeks periods if you play often, but it's still a lot of stuff compared to Season 3 ( which had a huge 9 months content drought ), Season 2 ( really little tidbits, 2 Maps and just an armor set spreaded over 4 episodes ) and Season 1 ( huge, huge waste of resources for non-replayable content ).
---
I am not saying I see the world with rose-tinted glasses, but even if slowly this Season has demonstrated that huge amount of content can be delivered, even if there were very stressful conditions and we should not diminish that.
---
So by reading between the lines, you've inferred that ANet meant exactly opposite of what ANet said. And this somehow validates Price's claims.
---
Keep the devs but sack the mount! 
---
I'd be willing to buy more mounts if they had a better selection in the store. Not a fan of thr current rotating skins business model. 
---
The entire point is this happened because they didn't listen to us.
---
I vaguely recall that they were a pretty big deal in the early years of WoW?
---
Look up Project Titan, or Stacraft Ghost. There is nothing unusual or disastrous about developing and canceling a project alongside live ones.
---
It's almost like prototyping and iteration were part of the game design process...but that could not possibly be the case. Why would anyone waste time with such things when they could have just asked the people on reddit.
---
I see!! Thanks so much. Do people still buy rare GS to roll a precursor? Or is there another reason people buy it? I remember buying a good amount trying to roll for my Dawn. 
---
I would say out of all the MMORPGs on the market, FF14's devs are the best. They clearly listen to their fans while still delivering content that everyone from all walks of the MMO world can enjoy. Even just watching their fanfest where they announced Blue Mage and the CEO walked out dressed like...well he was dressed like a pimp and then you look at Blizzcon and it's just clear as day who's the better company.
---
Not sure if you've heard of Aion, played the shit out of that beautiful game. Until NCsoft crushed it into the pay-to-play nightmare it is today. 
---
If ArenaNet goes the direction of Blizzard, they likely will lay off the non dev positions (Community Managers, admin, esports etc).
---
The raid design was excellent, honestly the most fun raiding experience I've had in almost 15 years of mmo's now. But the "hardcore" catchphrase they used to promote it and the lengthy attunement chain at launch just turned a lot of people off, even though the skill requirements really wasn't much higher than what's standard.
---
Big corporations screwing people is not what capitalism is. Capitalism is the idea that Person A can pay Person B to do work beneficial to A. This is fundamental concept that all of human civilization works on. In it's most ancient form, capitalism is Person A paying Person B to work his crops in exchange for food.
---
In Socialism if Person A has Person B work his crops, then Person B now owns Person A's crops, as under Socialism the worker owns the results regardless of whether the work was paid for by another. Which is why socialism is completely nonfunctional because Person A would never hire a worker if doing so would cost him his own field. Thus the entire basis of civilization would not exist.
---
So, on reasons to trust that she's telling the truth we have "used to work there", and on reasons we have to assume she's lying to make them look bad and potentially for personal benefit, we have "fired for being an asshole, for not even the first time".
---
Tangential question, what else is Anet responsible for?  Do they have other games? What other projects could she possibly have been referring to, in the unlikely event she's not just telling stories?
---
If the scenario you outlined is true (and no trustworthy sources have said as much) then even that is a gain for GW2 today compared to GW2 a month ago. If people were moved off, but some will come back, then GW2 actually benefits.
---
See you in clsssic WoW.. 
---
This has no place on this subreddit right now, please remove it.
---
I was talking to an ANet employee in one of my guilds and they not only confirmed that the layoffs pertain mostly to the the unreleased projects at ANet but also to be cautious of what JP says since she doesn't know entirely what's going on.  They didn't share much past that though.
---
I imagine people are following what JP says due to the lack of info and the bloodlust that Reddit likes to have at times like this.
---
Well, I can't play GW2 during my lunchbreak...
---
That would be... Strange O.o
---
Quick, light the Colin Signal!
---
Would they really be doing layoffs when developing a big launch like that? That seems when they'd do the opposite, and hire a ton of contractors.
---
it is the rarest item in the game
---
endgame is to collect all the minis
---
Most comment's I've seen have been in favor of the mount. That stale gamemode that lots of ppl tried to love but just can't for numerous reasons is finally getting an exciting change.
---
I remember when they added pips and reward tracks. It brought more people into it but even then some vets complained that "now all the pve scrubs will try to get the new armors".
---
Do we really care, as a community, about people getting worried that more newcomers will get into their gamemode?
---
"Zero replay value".
---
Multiple achievements for doing a story instance a particular way, some achievements easier with a group. Many of these achievements a requirement for legendary items.
---
/thinkshard
---
I followed it, yes.  I saw Mike throw her to wolves in a pathetic attempt to clam their bloodlust.
---
I'd love it. It would be just like finishers that way :D
---
What I mean is, revenant rytlock comes from having the delux or higher heart of thorns.
---
I have base game but I have him.
---
I shouldn't have him but i do.
---
Some additional information:
---
3. What he means is, points are awarded at specific intervals, but RI prevents objectives from being captured for at least 5 minutes. Well, a little more, 5 minutes of RI, a few seconds to kill the NPCs and then a few more seconds to capture the objective. If you you capture a camp with say, 5m30s left on the timer, the other team can come in and take it back before the points are awarded. If you wait for it to be 5m00s then they're denied the points.
---
4. Well, it depends on the class. Dragonhunters don't care where they stand when taking camps, thanks to GS5 and their traps.
---
6. as I mentioned in another reply, Supervisors can't hit you if you're off the group. Stand on the Supply boxes instead of running in circles for 2 minutes.
---
7. Keeps &amp; Stone Mist Castle get WPs at Tier 3. Towers don't.
---
9. You have to hold 3 of the 5 ruins for a couple of minutes. This cannot be done alone.
---
11. Map chat is map chat. Team chat is across all 3 borderlands and Ebon Battlegrounds. It's actually worse than it sounds.
---
Really she straight up calls Mo toxic looool
---
Dunno why people are suddenly holding her up like some kind of beacon of truth and virtue when she has proven history as a narcissistic lier.  
---
I'd be willing to buy more skins if 90% of the time my PC wouldn't load the skin under 10s after mounting.
---
I'm sure it was a decent enough game, but I honestly didn't know what type of game it was from any of the media attention it got. Did it play like GW2, DC universe (another one I did actually enjoy for the most part, but dear god I hated how they monetized that game), ESO, WoW, Spiral Knights, Archeage? Was it raiding exclusively or was there a world to explore? All ads focused on was housing, so far as I remember, and the sci-fi aspect.
---
They're saying that it was very specifically phrased as if it's something that male game execs do specifically. As in if there were more female game execs, that would not be the case.
---
May or may not be true, but that's not the point. You're being obtuse when her wording was clear.
---
She wasn't fired for 'standing up for feminism', she was fired for falsely accusing a well respected community member of sexism and then doubling down.  Let's not sugarcoat this; people like her are exactly why actual feminists have a hard time getting traction.
---
I don't agree with your reading of the situation.
---
Expanion-like features in Living World releases could easily refer to things like the warclaw. They did it once before with the rollerbeetle, they are doing it again with the WvW mount.
---
Additional mount masteries is different from a whole new set of masteries that would be expected from a new expansion. I doubt we will see elite specs in Living World. Expansion three will likely land after Season 5 with all the features expected of an expansion (new set of game changing masteries, new set of elite specs, new region of the world to explore) but Season 5 can be marketed as containing expanion-like features (new mount, new WvW server structure etc).
---
It depends on what you want. To me, I quit GW2 for WoW because the monetization just felt excessive. I’d rather pay $x a month and ignore most other payments, lots of them are fairly unnecessary. GW2 felt to me like “there’s no monthly fee but we’ll try to nickel and dime you when we can”. 
---
Maybe it’s an unfair opinion, but the monetization just always felt off to me. 
---
WoW definitely has its issues now, but that’s more gameplay related than money. 
---
Not me. I'm relishing in the fact that Ncsoft is taking a massive shit on Anet. 
---
Did you in turn read my link and what people of reddit say there? Maybe you should because this might give you some hints.
---
She is a cunt but i believe her.
---
This is standard industry practice. Happened even with GW1 and plenty of other online games.
---
Hiring mobile devs for years was a dead giveaway.
---
Ahhh, classic appeal to authority fallacy.  We're done here.  Toodles.
---
Companies milking old games for 5 years plus and wondering why revenue is dropping?
---
Guild wars 2 is what, 6 or 7 years old, so of course the excitement has waned somewhat.
---
Probably overdue to Guild Wars 3 if they want to keep raking in money of the IP.
---
Believing that she isn't lying about her claims here does not mean she's being held up like some beacon of truth and virtue, neither does one twitter spat make you a narcissistic liar; keep the exaggerated bullshit to yourself. 
---
Literally stop playing and look for something new, better do it now while you can still play GW2 to kill the time in between
---
Everyone is just a bit bummed out by the news.
---
But the game still has lots playing, and its profitable.
---
It's not shutting down anytime soon I think. 
---
Part of me thinks they've been a bit too generous in giving away so much free content tbh, when other games charge for add ons.
---
They still have developers?
---
Anet was making a decent amount of money from microtransactions.  The real problem here is corporate greed.
---
/u/BobbyStein Thanks for all the work you've poured into my favorite franchise over the years, stretching all the way back to the GW1 days.
---
/u/LinseyMurdock can't get enough thanks for everything from quest text to Nick and Yakkington to hard work on the Living World and storage upgrades. Part of the true heart and soul of both GW1 and GW2. #LinseyFaith
---
I mean you frankly sound like the person with the axe to grind in this case, lol.
---
It has nothing to do with diversifying.  I'm not upset that Anet wanted to make other games (in fact I'd love to see it!)  I'm upset that the development team actually working ON GW2 has slowly been bled out in order to work on products that were a crapshoot.  The only actual 'content' we're really getting is a few hours of story with no replayability.  We are being milked to finance things while Anet pretends it's throwing tons of dev hours at GW2 and that delays just had to happen and theyre working sooooooooo hard.  I have no doubt that those still working on it ARE working hard, but to me it's pretty shady to deplete your staff on your cash cow that's making you $80million a year.
---
Yeah that all could potentially be good. The main thing is just that it's stuff that's a bonus rather than stuff that is actively a detriment to people that don't have it to where it's a hassle to enjoy the game without it. Though the map instance/overflow things might be better as just an in general thing since people can just join map instance of people they're in a party/raid with and because I'm not sure how it could effect server health when trying to seperat classifications for subs and non-subs. But I don't really see much of an issue otherwise.
---
This. If 800gems was 10 bucks in my currency, I'd buy so many gems. Atm I pay over 40 bucks for the equivalent of $10. For context, 30 bucks of fuel lasts me 2 weeks of car use. 
---
Sounds like they are doing their best Baghdad Bob impression.
---
You know, I agree 100%. Sure, I do enjoy Living Story but why did they need to push out so much single player content in an MMORPG? It just doesn't make sense. They should've at least tied the story in with group content like most other MMORPGs have done. WvW definitely had the most potential of all the modes in the game overall I feel, since what's better than being able to go head to head against armies of other players? Unfortunately it didn't really hit anywhere near that peak, and for awhile I feel like ANet didn't even try.
---
I love this game, and it's a shame to see that NCSoft is getting more involved because I have 0 trust for them, but I do hope this game can bounce back now. Hopefully work will go into other important parts of the game from now on, and not just the single player content. I do like the story but there are other places that need development. We shouldn't have to wait for expansions in hope of any significant changes to pvp.
---
&gt;they'll keep failing upward, as male game execs do,
---
Let's not give a platform to this fucking nobody.
---
Yes, I 100% agree if that is the case. If they really are stretching their resources between different projects than I feel like they really should put everything into Guild Wars 2 as it could be a much better game than it is right now. It has great foundation and it is a great game to many (myself included) but has potential to be soo much more and since it's still making money it could live for a long time still!
---
"Hey, maybe raid content should have an easy mode for casual / pug players. Like every other MMO on the market. That hardcore players can have their difficult content, and the casual players have-"
---
"Get the fuck out of here, GW2 isn't like those other MMOs. Stop being lazy, just find a static group that you can meet with 4 times a week on a schedule, and you can clear all the raid content in the game. Back in my day, gamers didn't ask for handouts."
---
That's what my experience has been like so far.
---
I wish everybody at Anet good luck with whatever they end up doing during the forthcoming period of time. Was that vague? I think the message is there anyway.
---
Uhm ? Nop, anet doesn't give a shit about the game, why should I care about their job ?
---
They put 0 effort in, they dont listen to any feedback, the only updates we get are for milking black lion chests.
---
I'm neither sad nor surprised.
---
Well this tweet didn't age very well...
---
https://twitter.com/ArenaNet/status/1095450627721842693
---
Weaver is actually pretty good in pvp, it just has a very high skill ceiling because you're managing so many different abilities. If you want elementalist to be good in pvp (mostly weaver though), then you gotta sink those hours into getting good at it.
---
When was this announcement made? This is the first time I have heard about this.
---
That was a joke. Implying I wanted her to be a scapegoat to be laid off repeatedly in the stead of actually good people.
---
The spoiler policy ended like 2 weeks ago, dude.
---
lol
---
Doesn't matter. Absolutely everything goes through publishing before we ever see it.
---
I buy gems regularly enough that if there was an option to get gems through a sub fee; I probably would consider it, only for my main account though.
---
If ArenaNet have 100 more staff than FFXIV does and are this slow and stagnant with updates that is terrifying.
---
FFXIV puts out massive updates on a consistent basis that and new dungeons, raids, and whole new gameplay types that are all played permanently.  GW2 takes months to get around to a quick little hour or two long update.
---
People are trying to link these layoffs directly to Anet, these layoffs have more to do with NCsoft not generating as much revenue due to investing in shitty mobile games that only have market share in South Korea. 
---
You know very little don't you.
---
In order for a dev to do something, they need primission from the higher ups.. if they don't give it.. no matter what the devs want, they can't, unless they do it in their free time.. and well.. would you do work at your place for free ALL the time? .. No.
---
0 effort... learn the word you don't seem to know it.
---
Feedback - again, my first part.
---
Black lion chests.. shows you know nothing
---
Instead of shitting on all them.. shit on the specific people. 
---
I think LS2 was better thought out and more sustainable
---
GW2 is quite an expensive game to produce. They're probably still making a profit overall but not as much as it should be especially given xpac sales are not as high a they would have hoped.
---
Or you could just keep playing GW2...
---
And how many do you think would be willing to pay for that? How well do you think the remaining community would react? And how eagerly do you think the "geims jurnalizm" would pick up on a franchise that once prided themselves on not having a subscription model, getting one as their last breath?
---
No matter how you look at it, it just wouldn't make sense.
---
Please god please let one of the people being let go be the head of the current balance team. 
---
Yeah.....i noticed after i posted that. Sigh.
---
No offence but both of you guys need to get some perspective. Its a game not real life, games are ultimately just a hobby.
---
Chinese market is significantly bigger than EU + NA put together, and mobile MMOs are overwhelmingly the most popular way to play over there.
---
the game is still profitable, it won't be shut down any time soon. This is bad news, but the game isn't going to disappear.
---
all been done before though.
---
I'd rather see a giant fat charr Tempest or weaver with all those spins and whirls. (that's what I've been running)
---
Except it is the time for it. Something massive is going on at Anet and as a player we deserve to know what their plans for GW2 are. They gave off a statement repeating the same thing but that's not good enough. If they want us to keep playing and spending money they need to put everything on the table. The layoff news is doing insane damage to the game. They *have* to go into repair mode asap and show us what exactly they're doing. If they're unable to do that then I agree with OP. It is the end of the game.
---
You also shouldn't be all doom and gloom because then it'll become a self-fulfilling  prophecy. People stop playing because they believe the game is getting shut down and then it ends up doing so because of said people not playing anymore. 
---
&gt; Asians really love their mobile games...
---
I think it's more that it fits the lifestyle a lot better. Many Chinese workers spend 3-4 hours/day commuting on public transit, so a mobile MMO fits their life way better than a AAA PC or console MMO.
---
They should be paying for ads to show to people who don't know about GW2, not for people who are already interested in GW2...
---
Very?
---
If you can't remember your account details or provide proof of ownership then you could just be anybody trying to social engineer your way into someone else's account. Character names are publicly visible information which means that as a single point of information they're not particularly useful.
---
Try to access your old email accounts and do a search for emails from Anet to try and find out which email address is associated with your Guild Wars accounts. That would be the very minimum of what you need to start an account recovery.
---
Classic move:  get ANet to commit as many resources to other projects as possible while keeping a minimum to maintain GW2.  
---
Then axe every non-GW2 employee.   
---
That's how to butcher a studio while pretending to nurture and grow; keeps the morale up while scoping the slaughter.
---
Wouldn't trust a single word she says. 
---
NCSoft tried a MOBA and failed. Honestly they should just stick with GW2 or start dev on the 3rd. Youll NEVER dethrone LoL or Dota. HoTS is proof you won't. Nor will you dethrone hearthstone/MTG Online. 
---
It depends on what the layoffs look like. I don't trust NCSoft as far as I can throw them, but there are a few differences to note between this and the Activision/Blizzard layoffs:
---
1. They are giving everyone a heads up, giving them time to start preparing.  
---
Granted they don't know who is getting laid off yet.
---
2. They are more than likely going to layoff staff related to cancelled/suspended projects rather than GW2, though I could be wrong on that.
---
3. If #2 turns out to be accurate, then this is actually pretty normal, especially when any changes in direction or plans are made. I've been at two jobs where layoffs happened. The people let go were employees who were no longer being utilized as the product direction had changed.
---
Absolutely none of this means this is any easier or less sad for the affected employees, but it is a reality for business. 
---
She was doing so great with those statements of support too, until she decided to make it inflammatory again...
---
Its kind of obvious they are going to do this at what has happen but this post was completely unnecessary. All it reiterates is how selfish the OP is about this whole subject in a matter of hours people are told they have no job anymore. Seriously no respect for the parent company and who make it if you post this within a hour after the company had massive layoffs. Think before you post because all this does it throw more fuel to the already hurting pile of people tonight. 
---
Well congrats on turning it into a self-fulfilling prophecy.
---
People stop playing because they believe the game is getting shut down and then it ends up doing so because of said people not playing anymore. 
---
The game needs people to actually play it to stick around, ya know.
---
/r/cringe
---
alpine borderlands SET; both walls can be hit by a single treb from Hills; I'm not 100% sure but it might be able to hit the gate too; all it requires is two roamers with a single ram taking out the gate while a second roamer from an opposing team is just farming participation from treb shots :p
---
Or they brought in the blizzard peeps and got rid of old staff.
---
Yet she clearly likes and respects the dev team at anet and doesn't want them to suffer. Whats ironic is that you guys continuing to try and make out that shes the devil incarnate are behaving in a very similar way to what you say you despise.
---
This might get buried, but it's worth saying.

I became very concerned with the direction of content around the time of LWS3, and it has only gone downhill since. I've seen these same concerns brought up for years, yet to no avail.

A response I made to a thread titled "Realistically, how many more years do you think ANET can get out of this game?", highlighting the issue of longevity which has only grown WORSE since then, and now we find they are getting layoffs.
---
&gt;If 95% of what we're getting is open world and raids you can count me out.
---
And while I stuck around pretty long after making that comment, the sentiment in it is exactly why I no longer play the game.  
---
In conclusion:
---
These topics have been in clear view, so I have no sympathy if the game dies as a result of this. Players have been vocal in their dissatisfaction for a long time, but the issues have been ignored.  
---
There's a big difference in playing compared to spending money on it. No sane person is going to spend money on something they perceive as being on its way out.
---
This is one seriously hard rage boner. 
---
Visibility doesn't mean the work is any more or less intense. Considering the fact that the work Valve does is centered heavily (right now) around Driver work, GFX API translation, VR, and Networking.... my guess is that their work is just as intense, if not more so, than ANet's work considering that the 4 I listed above are much closer to the system than most GameDevs have to work.
---
...except for the underlying reason behind all evil:  humans with penises.  Or possibly all human who identify as male...  I don't really know or care how she frames her sexism.
---
If you look at earnings this is the hard truth. For most being profitable is the end game but once you attach corporations you need more. You need year over year profits each time. The moment it slips they layoff a huge chunk of the workforce. 
---
Gotta say. I agree with this guy
---
Of course it is simplified, it was just presenting a case where more focus still means less dev time spent on GW. 
---
Those industries are gonna get a big bite in the ass when they push for a huge investment and someone makes an irreversible push on an update that leaks tons of information, or somehow loses digital profiles.  This is simply the completely wrong way for the gaming industry and I'm really annoyed that we can continue calling these micro-casino-simulators a worthwhile investment; at least the arcade industry was very plain about it.
---
TL;DR any of the other posts about stuff. Stay calm people. As a web developer who has worked for major advertising companies this is the same thing as a company losing a big client. Project didnt work out and they are being let go. 
---
Why it didnt work out we will never know but don't go freaking out. It is just normal business. 
---
This is right after they told all the Blizzard folks that they're hiring.
---
That is possible but I think that the fact that they already said no expansion and a new season for 2019/2020 pretty much confirms that there currently are no set-in stone plans for after S5 and the unannounced projects were all non-GW2.
---
Wheres the evidence she's trying to manipulate anything? She just made a few comments about a situation that she is understandably interested in. You sound more manipulative than her.
---
I'm not even mad, I still have a job lol
---
Very true and sadly a lot of these times, especially for MMO devs it means hurting your primary project and if the new thing you're working on goes badly, everyone suffers and that appears to be what is happening here. 
---
But she said she's not happy about it and that hardworking people will suffer while leadership gets off mostly scott-free, which is pretty much inductively true.
---
This is sad news but thats what happens when there are no major new contents or games in the past year. New living world seasons and balance changes just aren't enough to sustain this game. Gw2 needs big patches like new game modes or major overhauls (e.g. in conquest) to draw in new players if it wants to make money.
---
&gt; When Price was fired, she immediately turned around and started trash-talking the company. Loudly. Publicly. 
---
Why wouldn't she given how she was fired? And given she has professed genuine support for the anet dev team I doubt she's trying to manipulate anything.
---
that what a cost for not making ghacha  mobile or battle royal game that what the cost to make a game we love sad but we just sad the trust is we didn't spend enough we not vote  with our money to says we love the game enough
---
ook ack argh
---
It’s not about sustainability. Growth and increased profits  year to year is what NCsoft executives and shareholders want. Just like Blizzard, even though 2018 was largely successful, they decided to go with the short term solution and cut 800 people to save money now because that’s what shareholders demand.
---
I don’t agree with any of this but I’m just saying what it is.
---
But you're kinda dehumanizing her here, like you think that she doesn't care about anyone there and that they depend on that job for their livelihoods -- I think you're letting your bias against her get the better of you. She's literally expressed that she's upset how this will affect the hardworking employees while the people mostly responsible (leadership) will get out with golden parachutes. She, more than anything, is standing up for her colleagues despite her bad experience. She really stands to gain nothing from lying about that situation at this point and she's right, the leadership will get off scott-free while the workers suffer the most.
---
Basically this: it's the last gen2 legendary to come out as well as the only gen1 to have 2 forms.
---
Omg they’re following the footsteps of Blizzard
---
Hopefully I won't get kicked, then. I'm too foggy to learn another class for WvW.
---
If there was any time for ANet to be more open about their plans, it's now. This post only guarantees the end of season 4 and then season 5.
---
Until the interview revealing that season 4 would transition immediately into season 5, it had been assumed that the next expansion would await us after season 4, similar to seasons 2 and 3. With the breaking of the pattern, the obvious question to be asked was "so what's after season 5?"
---
Logic, with some knowledge of past earnings reports, would dictate a new expansion, since that's when the bigger influxes of revenue happen. But maybe people also wondered if the game was going into a kind of maintenance mode with only living world updates happening, with black lion stuff being sufficient to cover those development costs.
---
Now people are just wondering if there even is an "after season 5." Well, maybe there isn't. Either way, ANet should let us know. 
---
The wiki page you linked mentions that it is an event that exists in the API but has no additional info and doesn't happen.
---
&gt; Bug: This event is in the API list but may well be permanently bugged.

GW2 hasn't been doing well for a while. Don't get me wrong, I love this game. It's been painfully obvious that none of the game modes have been getting the proper love they need/deserve. People were hoping there would be an expansion this year... but I doubt it. GW2 might be fucked
---
Yeah I know, but you know what I mean.
---
She has contempt for the player base and clearly has a vendetta against the people who rightly fired her. You say keep the exaggerated bullshit to yourself but that is pretty much what she has always peddled.
---
They announced season 4 will roll into season 5 skipping an expansion, with no word as to if an expansion was set for the future. Makes me think the expansion was the cancelled project. Season 5 may be our last story content. 
---
Actually, about the firing, the game director at the time, was it Mike B. back then, directly stated that the decision came from executives before the controversy even expanded all that much. The firing came as a directive from above... Executives I speculate meaning NCSOFT people. So, you can also see and understand why Price may not like NCSOFT and will also have a bias against them in the description of what was going on.
---
But I don't think any of us care for NCSOFT either.
---
The big question is what is the balance sheet of the game we are interested in? Did the other project's financing help keep knowledgeable people around and help maintain support GW2, or did GW2 money help partially finance the other project?
---
Is ArenaNet one of NCSOFT's biggest presence in the west? Or at least, as far as we know, it, and more specifically GW2, is the only current revenue generating component in the west. With only one readily available revenue stream, NCSOFT's presence in the west seems pretty weak. Also GW2 marketing has been pretty weak too, so maybe the elimination of the publishing arms in the west aren't too surprising. Hopefully this doesn't degrade support or other services too.
---
And barely ever used except when people were racing on player made tracks
---
Otherwise they weren’t used
---
Way to make fairly benign comments seem malicious ....
---
Send the details you can remember and try to work with the support. They are very helpful and helps lots =D
---
What do you need big groups for on any of those maps. When I call out events and pop tags on maps, I usually get a few people, certainly enough to do the events on those maps.
---
There is a state between dead and zerged. Those maps are certainly not zerged, but I spend a lot of time on both Season 3 and Season 4 maps and none of them are what I call dead.
---
In Ember Bay yesterday (maybe the day before) I did most of the main events, including the Drake, the Karka, and the Destroyer dude in the cave. I've done most of the events recently in Kourna as well.
---
Sandswept Isles is a go to zone for farming for me, and often I get stuff done there as well.  I'm not having trouble getting anything done, and I don't find the zones dead. I just don't find them zoned.
---
As for time, since I'm in Australia I'm in at all sorts of weird times. If you are on a US server, I can show you want I mean, just hit me up in game on Vayne.8563.
---
Really, seriously angry. I won't be investing a dime into ANet until we get some kind of commitment to the game that's actually making them money.
---
My big worry now is that assuming the fault lies with poor management, is said poor management going to be sticking around. That happens WAY too often and if anything I think GW2 might need some fresh minds leading the game at this point.
---
Star Trek Online has had 4 or 5 execs since it's started. We've had some absolutely shit ones and some incredible ones but it's kept things interesting. Our last exec there was IMO the best one we had in a long time. Current one I'm kinda iffy on. Focusing way to much no Star Trek Discovery but can't blame them since it means they get to work directly with CBS and the people making the show and most of the people working on the game are Trek fans so it's a dream come true to work with a show.
---
I want to salute Anet Ben P for his total dedication to the community like I've never seen from Anet. I really have come to respect him and his work ethics. He seems to pour everything in his projects, a real passionate! and communicates with us all the time. He's a true gem to have and I hope the higher ups are aware of all the good he is doing for their game and image. 
---
I agree it’s easier doing it solo, but the game was more fun playing with people and working together
---
The game was a mmorpg but towards the end it was a rpg with player trading
---
Honestly same the Guild Wars series means a lot to me, I really hope it keeps going strong.
---
I have been lucky and fortunate to have worked along side some of the Anet Devs. I've been to a Pax pre HoT were I was able to work with a few others, met and talked game with quite a few of them during the party / demo experience. Worked as a partner with others. And yet others who would simply stop by my stream to say hello, or even play in game with me (Tirzah just to name one).  This is a stressful and tough time for all of them. I wish all the them and their families the best and that regardless of what happens that they land on their feet quickly. Many of us in the community love your work and we love this game. &lt;3
---
Cool, so once again not a single word of an expansion after season 5, or ever. This "update" is stuff we learned from interviews after episode 3, so over half a year ago now. How in the world is this an "update"? This is like, what, the 5th time they specifically left out talk about an expansion when talking about the future of GW2? So you have a massive community, a good part of which is anxious about the future of GW2 and you "reassure" them by telling them news from 6 months ago and not mention the one thing they actually want to hear?
---
I really wanna stay exited about this game, but this "update" practically killed any hope I had for an expansion. There is a 0% chance that they are this tone-deaf and leave out the 1 thing we actually wanted an update to. "we plan to continue a regular cadence of updates and releases" screams only Living World releases from now on. Would be really nice if this was just another example of them having shit PR and this just being poorly worded, but I kinda doubt it.
---
I think NCSoft was farming out unrelated shit to ANet and siphoning off resources from GW2. Since present indications are that this is related to the cancellation of unannounced projects, we can only hope these layoffs represent the trimming of that excess, so ANet can refocus on their main product.
---
What do you mean... Don't you have a phone?
---
Yeah, but hobbies are super important to people. Like, imagine if suddenly *all* model trains went out of business, or all LotR books disappeared one day. People would be flipping out, people have invested money and time and emotion into things. Sure it’s “just a game”, but it’s also a world full of characters and areas we grow attached to.
---
Didn't she get fired for being an insufferable pain in the ass?
---
You probably said something that challenged her worldview and she needed to fix her bubble.
---
If you’re talking about Blizzard - WoW was pretty unaffected. They basically just dissolved the HGC staff and got rid of Diablo, HoTS and HS CS/GMs
---
What is happening? Seems like gw2 is falling... I quit for D3 then apex and it was doing ok pre-fractalbirds
---
That's where you're wrong bucko. Check out corporate profit vs wages over the last 40 years.
---
https://www.businessinsider.com/profits-versus-wages
---
No. I uses go live in country where 10£ is two week of work. Buying gw2 back when it costed full price was a huge commitment for me and I knew only one other person who bought it as well (freelancer programmer so figures). 
---
Every time I used this argument here I was quickly downvoted by more wealthy redditors but this don't change the truth. There are whole countries where people cannot afford sub. 
---
That's what I did. I literally only come back to play during new releases and don't stick around for long since achievements aren't relevant to me and there isn't anything to play for since most cool skins for everything are placed behind gems.
---
I've always wondered why we stopped transforming maps. I think new ones are cool, and I'm sure transforming one takes just as much time but when kessex hills became toxic that was so crazy. Lions Arch rebuild went bad but damn. Destroying those two maps was so kind blowing back then. 
---
It's the fact she had to specifically write as "male game execs do", instead of simply "execs":  to force her bitter, misandrist narrative. She couldn't even put that aside for one brief moment in order to convey sympathy for those losing their jobs.
---
What is stage 2 I don’t get it?
---
Ahh yes there it is the "I want things for nothing" defense.
---
so, after a long while away I came back. I guess I never did play it nicely, so I did the whole season 1 story and I'm starting season 2 now.
---
Except I'm stuck on "Fallen Hopes" where it says to use the lightning pull to reach a platform and it's stuck there. No matter where I go.
---
Yep. That's the big one people miss. He was fucked from the very moment he grouped with them. Guess he won in the end.
---
What he's asking you is if you happened to have gotten it from using a https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guaranteed_Wardrobe_Unlock
---
Though I'm not sure that mini was ever in the loot for those. 
---
I didn't know you were entitled to another person's money. Why do you think that companies are obligated to keep you hired forever. It's not your money, let them do what they want with it.
---
&gt;For those of us working on GW2, our mandate was essentially to make it look like there was the same level of resources devoted to GW2, when they were actually steadily moving people off of it onto the other projects.
---
Well it didn't fucking work.
---
Yet its a fact most execs in the gaming industry are male. And she conveyed plenty of sympathy, that was just 1 tweet of several.  
---
Sorry you had to lose your jobs over greed. Still my favorite MMO of all time. My friends and I tracked it for months hoping they would sell off the IP but they'd always find some bullshit way to keep it.
---
I played WS for a while. Got a character up to about 40 (out of 50) and just quit. It was too repetitive. I went back to GW2 which has held my interest ever since. GW2 is a better designed game.
---
They’re more sensible that I thought if they are working on other projects.
---
I put money into coffee and pastries that disappear in half an hour. Seems like my netflix money disappears every month. Let's not even talk about my gym membership. 
---
You don't BUY an MMO you pay for access, like an amusement park. You go there, you enjoy your time there, and eventually you go do other things. 
---
How many people are playing the same games now that they played 20 years ago?
---
But I paid for all those games.
---
I bought driving games I played for 20 hours for $60 back in the day. That's $3 an hour. This game is costing me pennies an hour. 
---
If everyone thought like you, there'd only be subscription MMOs.  Or pay to win ones.
---
Unionize.
---
If you were being paid without working, you would be buying shit with that money you are getting.  When people buy shit, that drives demand up, when you have demand you have companies hiring people to produce more shit to buy.  And if people where getting money without doing anything companies will pay employees more to give incentive to have people work.  Sure I could get 1k bucks without doing shit, but then that fucker over there will pay me 3k for my labor.  I could get 1k doing nothing or 3k doing something meaning I can buy more shit than the lazy person doing nothing.
---
NCSoft also fucked my hero Richard Garriot, have hated them ever since.
---
The birthday gifts alone will make recovering the account worth it. Rare dyes, unique armor and weapon skins, some unique backpack skins that are kind of ugly but still a thing in addition to some other stuff like teleport to friend convenience items. If you start a fresh account you'll be waiting six years to get these things.
---
It's depressing, really. A game can be incredibly successful, but if it's not [insert current loot box fuckfest game] successful, they pull the plug. 
---
Good luck. I hope you get it back.
---
Makes sense! So people are still chasing Gen1 legendaries?
---
&gt;Basically, these side projects which ultimately generated no profit but just drained resources and devs, have almost killed GW2.
---
I'll take "*the GW2 china release*" for 400. No wait, I'll take "*GW2 esports*" for 500.
---
This has happened in the past and I'm not even surprised anymore, about them mismanaging their ressources. I'm just tired and sad that this game, that offered the most potential out of any mmo I've ever played, was handled by people, that couldn't turn a profit from this goldmine. The story of Guild Wars 2 has always been a story of ressources being mismanaged and it's so sad to see the result of this mismanagement.
---
Well, there used to be subscription MMOs to subsidize the cost of servers, but that's not a thing we do anymore, for a number of reasons. I was just trying to say that games can be a bit like the stock market- if a panic causes a bunch of people to sell, the stock *will* crash regardless of the previous trajectory.
---
You're describing capitalism. Delror is arguing for communism. 
---
Having worked for a large corporation, that update is management-speak for "Something's going on, but we're either almost as much in the dark as you are, or it's bad but we can't come out and say it."
---
I've had a few over the years, some made for specific games.  I was strange with that stuff.
---
That would great.  Blizzard still has tons of employees and makes gazzilions of dollars. 
---
(I know you didn't mean that though lol). 
---
Thanks.  
---
You made me post this comment. Apologize for making me post this comment!
---
Those damn birds!!!!  LMAO 
---
I wonder if having a cosmetics based business model eventually leads to slower cadence and projects being cancelled. Affects priorities. 
---
I picked a bad time to buy the expansions
---
&gt; Are people being moved back to GW2? Is GW2 going to become the focus of Arena Net?
---
It seems that nope, they're just getting fired. I don't think there"s nothing good comint off this situation.
---
Jagex's management is a complete shit show. The only promising title they had, Mechscape/Stellar Dawn was scrapped in favour of a browser based Transformers title which flopped harder than RS3 after EoC. The [Runescape Remastereed MMORPG](https://i.imgur.com/IsVEzQM.png) that was supposed to come out during 2018 is nowhere to be seen and they currently have an ARPG (online?) based on Runescape's IP which likely won't ever come out. 
---
I think the issue is - druids wouldn't be useless, but they'd be useless relative to other classes. They wouldn't be able to compete with guards for boons / support, and couldn't compete with scrappers for heals / Condi cleanse. You could play them and contribute to a group, but it wouldn't be as good as a FB / scrapper (or probably even a tempest). I'd guess it'd be on par with worker warrior.
---
Thanks for this! I’ve lately gotten into WVW because I’m working on a legendary weapon and it needs a Gift of Battle. Having done that, I found that WVW wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be, so I decided to stick around for more ~~punishment~~ *fun*. (Plus, well, I do want that new mount anyways.) I also enjoy getting those sweet, sweet tomes for leveling alts, as well as the easy dailies, which of course help me with reward tracks, which incidentally also give me more tomes.
---
A lot of this is stuff I picked up on, but I see that I have more to learn here. See you in the Mists! I’ll be sure to ask more questions if I have them. And again, good thinking and thank you for putting this out there.
---
Don't be mad at people. Be mad at mobile game publishers who shamelessly do everything possible to exploit human addictive tendencies and further encourage that addiction for profit.
---
It's Kotaku, the same e-zine that spun the Price story quite horrifically in her favour, and it's also part of the gawker media group. I'm not going to say the story isn't true, just take it with a pinch of salt.
---
Im doing amnoon independence collection for ascended backpiece and i have 1 more item left to collect. How do i know what story choice i made if i cant remember it. I went through the guide to get the item from lost chest but it didnt give me the item.
---
And? This Aricle is talking about 2018 was not as good as 2017, which is correct. "Worst Numbers ever" last year is simply not true. 2018 compared to 2016 is interestening, because they have doubled their income (900 Mrd. Won 2016 to 1.700 Mrd Won 2018). 
---
And its way way better than 2015 and the years before.
---
Thanks for repeating part of what he said in his comment??
---
&gt;GW2 is 7 years old [...] A**t this point in GW1's lifetime, Arenanet had already announced GW2 and ended all development on GW1.**
---
This screams WvW and PvP.  It didn't take long for the community to see through what Anet/Gaile was telling us in that the resources for these modes was bare minimum.  One content update per year for each mode is rough.
---
Its kinda hard to say exactly how many but you can definitely tell out of 400 employees, more than 60% of them work on living world.  Apparently, Anet doesn't know how to monetize the game elsewhere so they just stick with what they know which are skins revolved around big features (gliding and mounts).
---
????????????????
---
GW: Immortal was cancelled for fear of backlash D: 
---
sad part is, these people aren't even really REAL gamers, yet it's fucking up certain genres the real gamers know and love.
---
It's easy to get into a panic when stuff like this happens. I suspect the game still has some years left before anything happens that I'll care about. My hope is that when the game finally does go into maintainence mode that someone else will have come out with something that fits my play style.  
---
I wouldn't prefer to pay a sub for this game, but since it's the only game that even remotely fits what I'm looking for an MMO (maybe ESO as well), I guess I'm here for the duration. 
---
It isn't making as much as fortnite. I'm joking but we have EA,Activision,Bioware,Epic all doing very interesting things in the name of profit lately. 
---
That’s terrible revenue for a company of 400...
---
Ah well l, you can always #learntocode.
---
Too soon?
---
Fooled us.
---
Well I'm glad at least she's convinced Anet is going to get out of this scot-free, because I'm drowning in anxiety over the potential fallout of all of this. Uhg.
---
Log in for daily rewards then log off
---
Unrelated but remember this bitch fest during mount gate, this is what happens when companies can't generate more revenue.
---
&gt; I'm joking
---
It's barely a joke. Why make $70mil a year on a game that requires large maps, a ton of art assets, voice actors, writers, etc etc when you can make a fuckton more with a battle royale?
---
Firebringer + Berserker = perfect match
---
Anet have confirmed this dude
---
&gt; Flame Rams
---
These disappear in 10 minutes, not 60. They're an exception.
---
Totally agree. But the game industry doesn’t work like that. If GW2 doesn’t make any profit, Ncsoft will cancel it. And it’s not a Secret that the Numbers are not that Great. But we are all just guessing. 
---
I hope we will see another expansion and great content
---
I felt the same way once with my Guardian. I started a new game with a new character, and rediscover the world. Best decision I've made.  
---
How many more rando asshats gonna get the axe?
---
The writing was on the wall more than a year ago.
---
thank you!
---
&gt; I'm sure that while the irony is there, Jessica Price, like anyone who was wronged like she was
---
Like hell. She did it to herself. No company would have let that slide and she never apologized to her victims. 
---
So no expansion i guess?
---
Now need to hope that a new quality MMO shows up :/ but everyone makes these damn battle royales.
---
I'm just hoping that big ceo's and money makers will yes, sadly run the current big games to the ground and milk them till they are dry, and move on. Then one day maybe people with an actual passion for making good games, can learn to also run a large company, rather than just have money goals. Probably not, but i dont see any other way. We for sure have more terrible times ahead in the gaming world. 
---
Everybody will be fired except essential personnel to keep servers up and fix small bugs.
---
I knew their monetizing strat was bad. Maybe selling small episodes as expansion would be better. Just like wow did.
---
Hopefully there will be something similar to guild war 3 soon. If exemployees stay in gaming buisness
---
She's shown that she cares about the workers at ArenaNet. And she was respected by fellow developers enough to have someone put their job on the line for her. You're just fine with dehumanizing her because you don't like her politics.
---
Anet started with 3 people. If I remember correctly between 40-100 people worked GW1. Just try to remember that.
---
Thank you, Gaile Gray, for wading into the forums on a daily basis and not losing faith in humanity. 
---
Also, thank you, Dev That Helped Me Kill A Djinn That One Time. I don't know your name, and I don't remember your character's name, but you will forever be in my heart. 
---
When the bottom line matters more than actual people.
---
Not sure if this is remotly true. Why on earth should they reach out to blizz devs for hiring and then lay off bigtime.
---
Whether it says male or not its not a particularly toxic statement as the post I originally replied to asserted. And there's no wish for vengeance there at all.
---
Not surprised - I gave up on the game shortly before PoF due to the devs not delivering on the contents that HoT was sold on (remember how it was meant to ship with all the gen 2 legendary’s?)
---
How many characters have you completed the story on you can hit H &gt; story journal to see the progress. If you picked independence you'll see cavaliers in amnoon city (otherwise awakened or sunspears). So if your character has cavaliers in the city and has completed the full story they can open the chest and get the item. Do also note that the chest that contains it can only be opened once per day per account.
---
Wait, so their idea of releasing "expansion level content" but not an expansion and **not charging** for it *didnt* work out?
---
Shocker...
---
That’s my number one reason for not supporting them after HoT. They had more time to release skins on the gem store compared to what the xpac shipped with
---
It's toxic in its implication that exclusively men "fail upward." It's injecting gender into a non-gendered situation for the *purpose* of creating division. That's one of the basic functions of toxicity. 
---
I hope you are wrong
---
Shareholding juice
---
&gt;I highly doubt that Aion and Lineage 2 are still going and I rarely see players in Aion and that still gets support.
---
Not in West, but in Asia they are still going strong. Hell, Aion had better quarter than gw2 while ago.
---
&gt;Guild Wars has been around since 2005. I doubt NCSoft will ever close down GW2 or 1 because people as still buying them.
---
Activision; Biggest game publisher in the world, best revenue year in decade, raking billions of dollars thro microtransactions "had" to fire 800+100 people to cut costs and make even more money.
---
Making money isn't enough. Making just profit isn't enough.
---
Shareholders demand sacrifice. Companies want more and more. Infinte growth. Double sales out of nowhere. Money.
---
I just wish the expansions brought something special for every game mode other than "new elite specs". But I hear you, agreed. Put thousands of hours and good money into Gw2 would hate to see it drop off.
---
Developing a good mmo takes quite a bit longer than for example those battle royal games or your garden variety casual mobile game, which is why theres always those "gaps" that to ignorant people look like the genre is dieing.
---
Mark my words, in 2-4 years theres gonna be a big mmo release. Probably not as big as WoW (that was really quite unusual), but big enough to fuel the genre for another 7+ years of development.
---
To play devils advocate and be seriously optimistic - maybe ANet will learn to do more with less. A team of 400 is huge for a developer and sometimes bigger teams can’t be as agile as smaller teams. For perspective Warframe’s developer Digital Extreme has around 170 employees and puts out new content almost every quarter.
---
SMC is like this a lot, so are a lot of towers. Some towers it's so easy to break them, and if enemy zergs are heavily defending them, one of the safest ways to siege them is to break all the walls and the gate to give the maximum mobility in and out of the tower. This allows your zerg multiple options to enter, so if they heavily bomb one choke you can through the other, it also prevents a single wall from being repaired and locking everyone in/out splitting your forces.
---
Banner still overpowered. Chronomancer still overpowered. Mirage still overpowered. Spirits still overpowered. Passive stat-boosting aura traits still overpowered.  
---
As I said with plenty of knowledge on the subject it was a very controlled project they worked on, it was partially successful towards their goals, and it was cycled into a sustainable format within the game they no longer have to contribute much further resources to. The completely separate division from any development phased out and the game continued on while anet is here laying people off from different project(s) that will never see the light of day and we will never know anything about other than it wasted likely much more than esports ever could have possibly cost anet. You try to put it as a failure right up there with the likes of GW2 China like even the scope of them were within the same universe when it was really just a small project they attempted and moved on from out of their own passion. It was a drop in the bucket in comparison to what is likely to be sacrificed to move on with this company and it really was a lot more successful than you seem to believe.
---
Also drama happens in plenty of competitive games and esports in a variety of different ways and I think if you weren't using it to try to prove your point you would just blame the players for being unable to control themselves rather than try to spite the company's choice to run esports.
---
You're setting yourself up for failure then, at this point. The game's content will slowly diminish, as much as other's would tell you otherwise, until they either 1) get developers back into anet or 2) close the game. I highly suggest you broaden your horizons and start looking for something else that will keep your attention. It's not like this game isn't a grindfest either so
---
There is a difference between "hating the management" and "hoping all former colleagues will loose their job"...
---
Yes, the thing that happens was shitty from her. But this doesn't mean that she wants to see Arena Net burn. I've also left a company because of bad management. And I will tell everyone who asks me, how shitty this company was. BUT, I am also friends with people still working there. Who do a very good job. Hoping the company fails, just because I don't like the management, is the last thing I would do considering my former colleagues.
---
Well I think thats just the spin you want to put on it, but an idle thought is there a female game exec that has failed upwards? Amy Hennig and Jade Raymond certainly didn't.
---
Yesss charred is the best 
---
Her politics were to harass a man for participating in an adult conversation... like an adult.
---
The politics she claims to have are fine. the politics she really has are narcissistic and sociopathic, like Anita Sarkeesian and Zooey Quinn. All of them just using a good cause to further their own notoriety. None of them actually seem to care about social progressiveness, otherwise they'd know better than to push mental gymnastics about how somehow redirecting harassment towards men is somehow better than just flat out combating It in general.
---
She's a fucking bully and a narcissist. She doesn't give a shit about her former co-workers, as evidenced by the fact that she not even ONCE mentioned the dude that got fired alongside her in any interviews, as doing so would defeat the narrative she wanted to push, that the firing was a sexist action.
---
Their expansion level content was disappointing anyway
---
Not with the current flow of content, but would if it changed
---
I cant spot any intentional bitterness in her comments and at that point, the current state of the game just supports her claim.
---
Actually, she said "They'll keep failing upward, as male game execs do, and the people who poured their lives and souls into making something they loved will struggle." No toxicity there...lol.
---
This quote from [Chinajoy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/1jea52/chinese_interview_with_arenanet_founder_mike/) in 2013 is hard to read in retrospect.
---
 "We now have four teams working on mobile apps development." Mike O'Brien 
---
Whether or not that was directed by NCSoft, I don't know, but if that mobile project lingered for 5 years with no results than leadership needs to take some blame.
---
Sadly, that was also around the time of Living Season 1.
---
Yeah, who would've thought that declining revenue and a game without direction could lead to this? If Anet really didn't see this coming they're more oblivious than I've thought.
---
&gt; because those departments were no longer necessary
---
That's not accurate. Those departments, in esports, still exist. Production for Overwatch League will be impacted by these layoffs as per an AMA with one of the employees who lost their job. 
---
If they knew what was after season 5 and it was good, they'd have probably told us by now. The fact that they very deliberately end the mention of future plans there, means that either they know that after season 5 there will be nothing more (which I doubt), or they plain and simple have no idea whether there will be something and what will it be ( which I think is more likely). 
---
Either way, I don't think development on an expansion has begun in any way, shape, or form, and to be honest my solemn assessment is this beloved game might have about 2 to 3 years left before getting plugged. Which I never dared to even fear before this shit came out. Anyway, I'll definitely be here till the end.
---
&gt; Well I think thats just the spin you want to put on it, 
---
Ok, then what do you believe is the spin that Price intended? What do *you* believe she meant by that statement? 
---
&gt;but an idle thought is there a female game exec that has failed upwards? Amy Hennig and Jade Raymond certainly didn't.
---
Most male execs don't either, they either perform, or their projects are cancelled. I can't think of too many execs in general that have been promoted off of failures, so I'm afraid I don't have specific examples for you. 
---
Better wait till Tuesday/Wednesday for feedback from true PvPers. If the upcoming balance patch won't fix all the broken things (based on history of previous patches the most likely it won't but there is still hope ^(as always)) then I suggest you to find another game. Though you can have fun for first few week untill you get better, discover and learn all the mechanics. Then you will start getting frustrated more and more that this game mode is horribly unbalanced and you have to deal with afkers, toxic players and even bots constantly. You also need to know that this is objective based mode in which very often it is better to run away than fight actually. If you are looking for more true deathmatch mode there is also open-PvP mode named WvW. It is even incredibly more unbalanced, but at least toxic players and afkers don't destroy your fun there.
---
Shareholders enable the company, and GW2 to exist. Don't forget that.
---
It happens a lot when commanders know each other and they are faced with a difficult enemy that doesn't play the way they like. You will see it sometimes when a recently stacked server pops into T1 and the other two servers in T1 are threatened by the new powerhouse. When faced with a strong server which threatens the other two, you will often see one server stand between their EB keep and spawn and not let reinforcements through while the other server captures the keep. This removes all upgrades (including the WP) and  dramatically hinders that server's momentum on EB (without a keep WP, running back to the zerg takes much longer).
---
The same scenario often happens when a server is dominating and holding SMC all week. The two weaker servers will double team the strongest one in SMC and will often allow one of them to cap. If they play a true free for all, it is VERY difficult to cap because every time the enemy servers contest SMC from each other, it benefits the defenders. Sometimes commanders will only attack the server owning SMC to allow the other server to flip it, which removes all upgrades and makes it easier for anyone to capture it immediately afterwards.
---
* Fixed a company crash.
---
Without knowing more this is basically an opinion
---
Well but this is the usual thing that happens in every company. Management has an idea, everyone works their ass off for 2 to 3 years, core business almost fails because new project is taking away most resources. And then, the moment this new project is somewhere near completion, most key manager get a new job and leave an half finished project behind and an core business, what is dangerously close to a state of no repair.
---
And the employees are the people left behind. Who worked over years under very hard conditions and stress to make something work that was destined to fail from the beginning. While the higher ups pin another medal on their jacket and move to the next company, to do the same all over again.
---
Bundle says unavailable, but stand-alone games do not. Interesting, but hey.
---
I sort of read that as expasnion 3 has been cancelled and is going to be chopped up and released in living world story 5. I wouldn't be suprised if they charge for each episode now.
---
Click the image to see it in full size and see the prices better!
---
I wouldn't pay for the living world if it was just the story. But maybe they bundle in an extra map per episode and 2 elite specs. I would only pay for it if elite specs was included.
---
Also imagine if they charge say $15 per episode. If they release five episodes all together it would make more than an expansion box sale. Assuming people are willing to pay that of course.
---
We seen this across multiple game companies, with ea, blizard and activision, telltale and more
---
The shareholders and investors need indefinite revenue growth... 
---
I’m gonna second Linsey Murdock here.
---
Linsey has always been incredibly nice and extremely forthcoming and helpful. Back before I was Atieno; I was more well known as Salome.
---
Under the handle of Salome, I was one of the Sysops of the GW 1 wiki and although GW 2 has never grabbed me the way GW1 did; one of my fondest memories is waking up one day to find that an NPC had been put into the game with my character name as a thank you for my work.
---
It was incredibly touching.
---
At the same time, Lynsey also added an NPC named Wynthyst. I know many of you probably don’t know the community history of GW1; but anyone who did would know that myself and Wyn did not have the easiest of relationships. However she was passionate and driven and I know that she was truly touched by the NPC in her name.
---
I still sometimes go to visit the ingame grave of Thyst in GW2 (a memorial to Wynthyst, who sadly passed away IRL in 2014) and when I do; I still think back to the day of her NPC being revealed in GW1 and how truly touched she was.
---
So thank you Linsey; things like that took GW beyond just a game, they made us a community and for that I will always have the highest opinion of you and your work.
---
The funny thing is how this latest circlejerk bandwagon jumps to take her word as bible by the same people that went after her. Hence, the irony.
---
TIL I should sub to FF14.
---
Where in that article does it state 33%?
---
More to the point, ANET has built up enough good will with it's player base that if they are transparent that they need to make X number of sales per month to stay solvent -- I'd bet you a dollar that this fan-base would rally together to make that happen.
---
NCSoft thanks you for your contribution.
---
To be fair, mounts alone and the new zone to play in was enough for me to get PoF
---
*were lol
---
XIV doesn't rely on nostalgia references as much as it appears. The main story is very popular among the players and it's very much its own thing.
---
&gt; Map chat != team chat, so reply accordingly.
---
To add to this, since I've seen this asked several times in wvw in the last few days: the only people who can read map and team chat are the people on your server and your allied server (if you're linked).  You opponents cannot read either chat.  If you want to talk to your enemy, block them to get their name, double click the name in your block list, remove block to whisper them.
---
Wait... Anet has marketing ppl? I thought the receptionis was responsible for that...?
---
&gt;I don't know a thing about game companies.
---
Don't worry, neither do they
---
the art is nice but the heart eating has me concerned
---
When I came back to WvW after all of the changes, I think the biggest thing for me to wrap my head around was that there are THREE different kinds of experience/rewards to keep track of:  
---
**World Experience** (aka **WXP**) - Blue bar at the bottom, points awarded per kill or capture ([**Numbers found here**](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/World_Experience)). Does NOT rest. This is for WvW rank, bragging rights,  WvW Legendary crafting gates, and Ability points to upgrade your abilities with siege weapons etc.
---
**Skirmish Reward** \- Every 5 minutes a "tick" happens, and you get "Pips" depending on how your team is doing, your WXP rank, and other factors ([**Numbers found here**](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Skirmish_reward_track)). This is NOT increased by participation as long as you have rank 3 participation or higher. DOES reset every week. This rewards different tiers of chests, mainly for Skirmish Claim Tickets and Memories of Battle.  
---
   
---
**WvW Reward Track** \- Also every 5 minute "tick," rewarded based on participation level. You pick your reward track. ([**Numbers Found here**](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/WvW_Reward_Track)). Does NOT reset, but some tracks are not repeatable once complete. This is mainly for that sweet sweet loot.   
---
Try to not get confused and have fun!
---
I can't check in game right now and I have only the information of the wiki to rely on and there it is listed as being available.
---
Why do I feel like this was written in manner of "this game is kinda dead, we are putting it into something similar to maintenance mode while we are working on something different"? I though this game has no problems with population and income generated... am I wrong?
---
I'll start supporting them again once they start releasing more than 2 hours of content every 3 months. Until then, I'd find more enjoyment in those 6 cups of coffee.
---
I mean let's give some context: In the same period, blizzard had over 6000 people working on wow. 400 is a lot, but it's also not as many as you seem to think.
---
Nowhere. Official statement says that no gw1/gw2 staff is affected. It was about other, unrelated and unannounced projects.
---
Well I cant read the last sentence with any other voice but Jim Sterling's.
---
To be fair that was before they knew this was coming I imagine. At least the social media people who did it. Maybe top management knew it was on the horizon but I doubt everyone else did.
---
in OP's ass
---
%100 this. 
---
If you ignore gender you can ignore JP
---
Dang, these are dope! I've dmed you! 
---
Writer by trade. That's a horridly bad way to describe how we write stories. 
---
Plus, as much as you hate Jessica Price, she has been very consistent on the issue. She dislikes MO and management, not the others who she worked with. If she were really the asshole here she'd be shitting on everyone, not just her ex-boss. 
---
The funny part is, this:
---
=
---
&gt;she has an audience wanting to believe the worst about the game they like because drama is more fun than waiting for more content.
---
= 
---
It actually applies to you more than it does her. You want to believe the worst about her, so you're making a wild, invalid claim about her being a 'manipulator by trade' because you'd prefer drama over I don't know, taking it as it is -- an opinion by someone with an inside perspective.
---
How valid it is, nobody knows. But please stop coming up with hot takes like 'writers are just manipulating you'. You clearly have no experience in writing.
---
It was for my Valentine's Day Hannibal (the series) themed YCHs (Your Character Here) haha
---
buying gems wont change the situation. you'll just fueln soft with more money but they still might be laid off
---
I admit I took my inspiration from him when writing this, but I've seen other Youtubers say the same thing, at least the same meaning.
---
So in short no real update. We knew all of that, and they can't assure anything if NCSoft CEO has still such power over Anet. They can say whatever they want, but it may end up like TellTale. Mid through final season:/
---
ArenaNet is a one trick pony studio, and this news only really confirms that fact that as a result of them evidently having failed to pivot towards being a multi-title studio.
---
GW2 will wane over time, but not to any extent that a high-profile release like an expansion wouldn't mitigate for the next few years.
---
I'm sure they will eventually develop games beyond GW2, but it's going to be GW3 instead of an unproven franchise in an market segment far outside the studio's comfort zone.
---
GW2 doesn't have the same problems as City of Heroes did or Wildstar did when they closed, but the bottom line is the same: operating costs.
---
NCSoft may be the parent company, but the more revenue they see from GW2, the less inclined they will be to shut it down.
---
Everything i have read from/about her even from pre arena net days has shown she has some major issues and i would hardly take her word as gospel. She hates the players , she hates the management and maybe she likes some co workers but i believe she would feel vindicated if the game died tomorrow if people lose their jobs so what? she died herself and she is always the victim.
---
in another post we learn that gw2 isnt as effected as we all may think, as gw2 devs and resources were used on other projects that didnt generate any revenue for a long period of time... so in short, we are getting some of those devs back to work on gw2... i know im just silver lining things but it is what it is
---
&gt;This statement applies to 90% of all comments on the internet. Why use facts and official statements when you can use your feelings as the truth.
---
FTFY
---
Sorry Anet , tx for trying to make us feel "safe", but, as long as you are under the paw of ncsoft, no matte what you openly state means nothing since we know ncsoft history. 
---
We can only hope , and thats best we got.
---
Tx for update anyhow.
---
Link?
---
&gt; She doesn't give a shit about her former co-workers, as evidenced by the fact that she not even ONCE mentioned the dude that got fired alongside her in any interviews, as doing so would defeat the narrative she wanted to push, that the firing was a sexist action.
---
She mentioned Peter Fries. Granted, days after the whole thing went down. But she did mention him. But I agree... It was very odd to see 2 people got fired for the same reason but she was only talking about how woman are treated in the industry and how unfair everything is that happened to her. Felt like someone reminded her halfway through that Peter Fries was also fired that day.
---
coming back after today’s announcement is a little prophetic...
---
Man I miss Exteel every single day.
---
So, to ensure I understand your argument.
---
You'd rather have 6 cups of coffee (your coffee costs $2 per?) than prevent GW2 from being shut down in the future due to "insufficient profits"?
---
Plenty of companies exist without issuing shares.
---
You're right, GW2 should add a battle royale mode.  Everyone drop in naked and grab what gear you can find!
---
She's just sexist tbh.
---
have you checked for runes on tp? some people sell them
---
&gt; Former Guild Wars 2 writer (who was controversially let go last year following a Twitter exchange) said the layoffs were "not surprising".
---
Fuck off, JP. Pour your [Vial of Salt] somewhere else and give us back Peter Fries.
---
good. this sjw shitshow of a game needed to end at some point. truly a disgrace to the original masterpiece
---
Look up how the stock market crashed.
---
When people lose confidence in the "market" they do not "invest", which just makes the "market" less appealing and easier not to have confidence in.
---
Only when people recognize this is when we can prevent a "rush on the bank" situation.
---
Anet is not bringing in enough profits from GW2, so they have to lay off staff, making players less likely to make purchases of GW2 products -- making them more likely to need to lay off more staff or close for good.
---
&gt;While **no official number** has been announced by the studio, it is **believed** as much as 33% of the company could be let go.
---
so a random guess by strangers on the internet
---
Game is already heading towards EOL why else do you think they cancelled the expansion for living story episodes
---
Stronghold was never developed by the esports division so you can blame the same people that do any other development on PvP instead for that, as will I for that matter because it's trash. It also has nothing to do with esports in general no one was asking for that and there was already 5 major anet sponsored tournaments before that even released. If anything it barely holds a candle to the amount of development time put into the ghost town that is most of PoF's core maps for instance.
---
I'm familiar with the viewership numbers they hoped for with GW2 Pro League final LAN for instance and it was maybe half of their best case scenario for that specific event. They had no delusion of it being the next League of Legends they just had passionate people that wanted esports to be something GW2 could truly embrace and had the budget set aside to use it on. That budget would have stayed within the marketing department to be given to the same people who came up with [this](https://i.imgur.com/nd1kEwj.jpg). As far as I'm concerned that would have likely been worse.
---
I'd just say that to remember it as a failure that dragged the company down is probably the worst light you could paint it in there were people who worked really hard to make it happen and despite success in the past with other tournaments that they had sponsored and were happy with they fumbled with the league. I can't stress enough that the money would have gone nowhere else than some other marketing "attempt" like rollerbeetle cars or the friend/ships media campaign. It's all money going out hoping for it to come back in return.
---
Probably going to be downvoted, but let’s be honest: best case scenario the game goes into maintenance mode, worst case NCSoft shows up one day and suddenly kills it. Either way the game is probably going to end.
---
You have no friends or what? Lmao. 
---
For real gaming, folks have to have an attention span larger than their wallets.
---
220 gold although if I buy one and next week is another axe with leather glyph its going to bother the hell out of me lol
---
DSD floods 70% Tyria. Everyone drowns. GG.
---
I don't want to argue against this. I also don't know her and actually could not care less about what is going on in her head. I only pointed out my own experience with bad management.
---
Maybe she wants to see the company burn? Maybe she really doesn't care and it is just her form of private damage control to restore a bit of her reputation? I don't know. Would be sad if so but then again, I can't tell people what they are supposed to think/feel. So no point in arguing about it.
---
&gt;happy to sacrifice 2 Starbucks coffees this month
---
That contribution is too small to be worth making a thread about
---
I don't know and really see it from a different perspective or rather reserve my judgment until there are more information.
---
On the one hand you have a statement that "massive layoffs" are happening at ArenaNet but nobody knows actual numbers. Then some people blame ArenaNet for it and others NCSoft (even though the original message came from NCSoft). This message reads to me as a quick response to the Statement of NCSoft.
---
I mean look at all those posts. Players are concerned and others have already thrown the towel. The Game is dead, the game is dead.
---
And also looking at the communities reaction I think this a bit hypocritical. On the one hand, they say it makes this situation look worse but in the many times ArenaNet deliberately waited to analyse the problem to give a more real statement the community put them against the pole for "not answered or responding to the problem".
---
We don't know shit, yet. We don't know how many or who will lose their jobs. We only know that something will happen.
---
Maybe this is even a good thing to shake them Awake to look at what they created and what is wrong with it and take the feedback of the community to their hard and implement those changes to make the game more replayable.
---
Of course, but ANet/NCSoft isn't one of them.
---
I would assume that GW2 needs more resources than GW1. But I agree... Should this mark the end for GW2 and the start of GW3, I also hope that it just runs along.
---
&gt; It's understandable if you want to cut your support, but consider continuing it. 
---
But wouldn't **now** be the perfect time to switch to something else, or re-evaluate what status a MMORPG has in your gaming time?
---
Where did the statement say this. I mean this is actually good news if true.
---
The game is still played by a lot of players but the thing is that there could be so much more active players nowadays. For veterans (such as myself) most of time there is no hype, no bait ... something that would keep me interested in daily playing. I've done every repetetive content in the game for a loooooong time. I just would like to see something new or some revitalized version of it.
---
At the end of the day the need for respect goes both ways. The only requirement to get a commander tag is 300 gold and 250 badges of honour which means that's essentially anyone can get one. Not every commander is going to be competent, not every commander is going to be tolerable to be around. There's nothing magical about a commander tag that will stop someone from being a dickhead. Ultimately, if you're not having fun or if a group makes you feel uncomfortable, it's okay to just leave. See if any other tags are running, jump on a roaming build and ask in teamchat if anyone is interested in roaming with you.
---
My post was largely written around a lot of experience with individuals thinking their personal desires superseded the needs and desires of the group. This is something I feel deeply disrespectful and inappropriate. But this doesn't mean you have to tolerate people being abusive or just being socially maladjusted jerks. People should be respectful to each other and the bad apples shouldn't define the whole.
---
Probably far too early, but the Warclaw stream scheduled for today presents an ideal opportunity to speak to us directly, which is assuming that stream even goes ahead .... 
---
I do agree though, 100%, communication is hugely important right now. There's obviously internal stuff to be dealt with (one of the dev tweets indicated Anet have at least been on the ball on this, which is great to hear), but there's clearly a lot of uncertainly and concern about what this all means for the future of the game. So some sort of clear indication of what this means going forward would go at least some way towards alleviating those fears.
---
Tbh when I first got into GW2 and saw how they handled exploration, leveling up, quests and other PvE experience, "wow this is like Wildstar but better" popped in my head
---
Still I miss Wildstar aesthetic, it was unique contrasting to all the high fantasy MMORPGs we have
---
So, question: Since NCSoft is taking over the Publishing, does that mean they will also be involved in the monetization now?
---
You clearly have no idea how the process of content creation works.
---
That's why I just call them capitalists parasites instead. Since they don't actually do any if the labor themselves 
---
In reality classic WOW will probably drag some players away from GW2, especially considering there won't be an expansion this summer for GW2.
---
You reap what you sow.
---
Raids community is dwindling because the game mode isn't supported. One wing every 9-10 months that consists of 2-3 bosses and some events is not enough to foster a growing hardcore community.
---
Also, I wouldn't say it's "hands down the least played" when PvP is also super neglected and plagued with bots and previously wintraders. Even WvW is pretty dire, there's a couple of servers into it but most servers are completely dead when it comes to WvW. And again similarly PvP and WvW modes are not played because they're not supported.
---
It's not rocket surgery that if you don't support and foster a gamemode, the players who enjoy it are going to leave for greener pastures.
---
As someone who enjoys tryhard content myself and absolutely loathes the open world and style of story content in GW2. I'm certainly thinking of moving on to another game, the problem is for players like me there isn't an MMO that combines the action orientated gameplay along with other good hardcore system like a stat cap (so success is based on skill) with a large content stream.
---
I haven't seen anything mentioning Peter Fries. I know he's not working at Anet anymore after the whole JP stuff, but he brought us some amazing environments starting with Factions and was a writer for GW2.
---
I don't know if he has a Reddit handle anymore and I don't use twitter, but I wish we'd show him some love.
---
From what I’ve read, it seems like NCSoft is wanting to cut staff that aren’t working on Gw2, so the studio can solely focus on Gw2, and pour that money into what is making money, than spreading it out for projects that aren’t earning anything. 
---
That would be great :)
---
Have you played RimWorld ?!
---
I saw the pack up there they are available but I had the dog which I got on sale and it works to my linking so far for scavenger rune, and I'm normally Allways broke on gold. So I saved the gems there.  But never thought of all that. Thanks! 
---
I'm pretty sure a *lot* of people have been asking for mounts in WvW.
---
&gt; like I get you’re being optimistic
---
I'm not, I'm also not pessimistic I just don't have enough information to form an opinion.
---
&gt; it screamed of a company that’s just downsized it’s plans
---
As someone else pointed out, this post was made by someone who is pretty unknown int he forums and if I'm not mistaken by the forum profile [here](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/profile/discussions/ArenaNet%20Team.4819) it is even the first post this account made.
---
So it could just be someone who got told to "release a quick statement to address them and tell them what we are working on on what you are allowed to tell them". So, there is a balance patch upcoming, Season 5 too. I know that this is pretty much of what we know already but as I said there is not much to go by.
---
Yes, it is concerning and I would lie if I wouldn't be as well but there is not much information to actually form an opinion on this, at least not in the form I have seen since yesterday.
---
I mean, for all we know they could present to us the best content release there is and ever will be but they are not allowed to talk about it. (or, of course, the opposite that you and many others are right and they have nothing in the pipeline) But again, there is no information that supports either way of thinking.
---
Crossing my fingers
---
Holy shit guys. The tin foil hats are out in full swing tonight aren't they? How about you wait and see what actual facts from trustworthy sources say before we dig the grave and buy the coffin?
---
You're as bad as the body language readers giving a 50 point explanation for why Celebrity X is leaving her husband because her body was angled five degrees differently when she hugged him in the rain, and she only hugged him for 5 seconds instead of 6 seconds.
---
It doesn't matter what forum account they commented on, it's irrelevant to what's being discussed. Calm your tits.
---
*looking at you Diablo Immortal* Certainly making WILD assumptions ^^^/s.  Color me skeptical, but mobile is the 1 gaming market that I have 0 interest in, largely due to the abusive nature of mobile games on the player.  You want that next level of Candy Crush?  Pay $1! Need some extra units? $2.  Want to just win at everything?  $50.  
---
Lol, still not super fond of JP bringing gender politics into everything, but all information and insights are valued and helpful when you hear the news we've gotten.  
---
However honestly, if what she says is true I don't find any of this surprising. If you dabbled in any two parts of the game, from sPvP, WvW, and PvE; You can tell resources are strained. Often you would see PvP people complaining that PvE got all the attention, or PvE people complaining about focusing on PvP for class design despite splits, and WvW constantly feeling neglected until they get mount, which seemed slightly of out of nowhere.  
---
A-net has always had a "when it's ready" mentality, and that's fine. But how often is something released and broken hindering progression for hours? Or small, innocuous, and sometimes redundant? Or something dangerously exploitable is implemented with fairly obvious oversight? Or balance which, although many would argue against, has gotten much better since the early days in, but still seem very disconnected to the reality of the meta (unless it's raids).; And all thee above despite such lengthy wait times between updates?  
---
I think it's fine and the game is still fun to me regardless, however I highly doubt such a thing is sustainable. With 2017 being the release of PoF, but here we are heading into year 2 and we have no upcoming expansion to purchase. Skins are getting re-hashed, mundane, unappealing to the masses, and with the climate on loot boxes only possibly being staved off by the statuette; I'm not surprised to hear about strained resources and now seeing cuts and possibly a re-focus.  
---
Also if a mobile game was in the works it would have had better give me decent in-game stuff and be released nationally (that means also in Canada, looking at you Dragalia Lost). Otherwise we'd probably be looking at another: "Do you guys not have phones?" - Blizzard moment.  
---
At the end of the day I'm fine with anything that affects the health of the game for the better. If the game is still supported and we are going to get a more polished and focused experience, then good. Rip the people who lost their jobs, I wish them the best. However, from how it sounds A-net was filling positions they really shouldn't have.
---
Kralka is NCSoft.
---
Good riddance I hope it goes under, fucking censoring everyone on the forums, fuck them, well now they never heard any of that valuable criticism that might have helped their game.  Now it can go down in flames while they plug their ears and wonder why.
---
It's funny how so many people are responding with comparisons. The first thing I thought when I saw this was "he looks like [Timothy Omundson])(https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--POJL0xq2--/c_fit,dpr_3.0,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/d3wq7kma2p6sekzviydl.jpg)!"

My daily iced lattee costs $6 from Starbucks.  I'm not giving that up for a company that made over $70 million in 2018.  If that's not sufficient enough, then it's a management problem.
---
Theyve been working on a mobile game for over 3 years. And there were many subtle and not subtle hints through job offerings and linkedin profiles.
---
Can do whatever you wish pretty much
---
* do 100% core map completion
---
* do dungeons for dungeon tokens so you can buy dungeon weapons and armor (unique skins)
---
* daily fractals for some gold and ascendant trinkets, agony resistance, higher fractals, more gold
---
* silverwaste farming for gold
---
* hunt achievements, they will take you to all sorts of places and content
---
* do all jumping puzzles and mini dungeons
---
* world boss runs
---
* did you finish your core zhaitan story? Why not?
---
* If youre bored of core zhaitan story, have a better experience by playing HoT or PoF story
---
* Grind gold,or even better, support the devs and buy gems and unlock living world episodes
---
* Season 2 is placed in core world zones and offers a nice recap and intro into HoT expansion
---
* Season 3 comes after HoT story, and each episodes comes with its own zone. Each zone has its own currency and rewards and they are totally worth it!
---
* PoF story play trough offers the newest content and will guide you trough acquiring mounts which are super usefull
---
* Did you finish the living world season 1 recap from your journal? Wanna know more about it? Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d17gwV4vXOg) video!
---
* Finish tough hero challenges in HoT or PoF zones so you get 10 hero points each and fully unlock your 2 new elite specializations
---
* Dont know which elite spec to go for first? Try them out in the pvp lobby!
---
* Finish the elite spec achievements and collections for a cool armor piece and an ascendant weapon
---
* Finish HoT and do the traherne mini event for a very special super unique ascendant weapon!
---
* Learn your profession, gear up ,watch some video guides, train your rotation on the aerodrome golem in lions arch and try out raiding
---
* Remember to join a guild that has like-minded players. Be it pure raiding, old school dungeon farming, pvp-wvw focused guilds, or just a regular social fun guild.
---
* Try out pvp! WvW is getting a exp buff soon so might as well hop in (tho you might wanna take some changes to your glass cannon gear and build before you enter)
---
* Got a lvl 80 booster? Create new characters with different races and try out other professions in silverwaste with the lvl 80 booster trial!
---
The list goes on and on :)
---
&gt; Assuming people are willing to pay that of course.
---
I highly doubt that many would.
---
It depends on multiple things.
---
If there is a new project in development (GW3 or new IP), then how close to release are we? Let's say it's GW3 and we are roughly 2 years away from release. Then they could do the same thing as with GW1. LW5 would be the equivalent to EotN and instead of going from LW to the next expansion, we go to another game. And to be honest, the current story really drifts to a point of no return. What if we really loose the fight against Kralk in LW5 and Tyria get's destroyed?
---
Option 2 is: We are really far away from the release of GW3 or the new IP, and everything that JP said is true. That more and more resources are pulled away from GW2 to realize this new project. If this is the case, announcing that there will be no expansion after LW5 and GW2 will go into an maintenance mode, might kill the game. The only reason why GW1 survived years of no new content, even between EotN and GW2 release, is the arcade like modular skill system. Heck, the game is still more or less alive today. But this is something, GW2 doesn't have and thus it will become harder to keep it alive in maintenance mode.
---
The question is... What brings the unannounced project to the table that can't be realized in GW2? If we are talking about GW3, then I can think about a lot of stuff that would make the transition to a third release in the series worthwhile. I mean, if we really loose against Kralk and Tyria will get destroyed, almost everything needs to change. And we all know that maps are frozen in Time and you can't just rewrite everything from core game to now.
---
But if we are talking about a new IP, I would be a bit upset with Arena Net. They had reason to make the move from GW1 to GW2, because the engine back then didn't support further development on the game. If we just abandon GW2 now for something complete different, I loose my faith in Arena Net to bring anything to an end... (Or to stick to a product in general)
---
Are you sure you want that? Their job openings have been talking about a mobile game. If they announce that now, they'll have a Diablo Immortal on their hands.
---
It was supposed to give some confirmations of what's going on without going into full details because they haven't been worked out yet.
---
They confirmed Season 5 will go ahead as planned and a regular cadence of updates will continue. Also known as, on our end of the game nothing has changed.
---
They can't say explicitly what's going on with staff because not even the staff know who is going and who is staying yet. There is no reason for them to tell us any of that until the staff are told first.
---
The thing is, Anet is not at fault, it's big daddy NCsoft.
---
Just yesterday people were screaming in the WvW threads that they wanted the meta to be shaken up.
---
Well, NCsoft delivers. 😔
---
This games community is adorable lol
---
They never cancelled anything.  You are only guessing at this point.
---
Rallying (where a player gets back up from killing an enemy) can be a very important mechanic to win big fights. So you can help out your team by killing downed enemy players. You can also help your team by not going in and dying. You're actually helping out the enemy team if you die and rally a bunch of downed enemy players. Win the rally war, win the fight.
---
"is NCSoft just going to say forget the other game and work on GW2"
---
I think GW2 is too old a game to be the future for ANET. Due to its age revenue will continue to decline. I think the morelogical option would be to put less resources into GW2 and work on games which will finance the companies future.
---
less dev -&gt; less progess -&gt; less release -&gt; less money -&gt; less dev .... until there is nothing left.
---
Correct me here, as I may be wrong; but wasn’t PoF released like out of the blue?
---
Like their was literally no preamble, it was like “oh we’re making an expac and even more, it’s out next month!!!!!” And everyone was like “wtf? Okay woooooo!”
---
Someone translate please :( Google translate is always good enough but misses a lot of small details in languages.
---
I quit WoW for GW2 because of the monetization and because I simply prefer the game in most ways. We'll just have to agree to disagree. 
---
1. Sure, I know what you mean. Doesn't mean you're correct.
---
2. We were actively chasing a god, that's as much of "the god's story" that Episode 6 entails. Sure, Balthazar wasn't in the map, but we were going after him directly. If the gods' story continues - S4Episode 6 or not - then it won't be about their legacy of what they left behind, it'll be about them in the present just as Season 3 and Path of Fire was, just as Hall of Chains was.
---
You mean it's sad people throw money at games that actually put effort into keeping a player base happy and trying to ramp up content speed.
---
People hear mobile and immediately think trash yet I can sit here and play Granblue and put everything it puts out up against most MMOs and its laughable in comparison. 
---
I mean most of the things wrong with mobile game monetization is in GW2 already. 
---
In amazon we trust.
---
So a friend told me about the game long time back, and how fun it is,  so I ended up getting it and my friend was like great, and his advice was to harvest body parts to use later, and can use the human skin to make hats. I was like “Who are you? I don’t even know you anymore”
---
And if you go this far you sure can eat them &gt;.&lt;
---
The game scares me...
---
That was one of the things people said about gw2, "oh NCSoft? Don't worry anet still has full control"
---
Thanks gaile for keeping the forums safe and secure =)
---
1) Yes, it's an issue, and yes, it isn't solved. My whole point was that it might not be realistic to expect it to be solved at all. Rest assured the devs have more than enough on their plate supporting and continuing to develop a game that massive. It's a simple matter of managing your resources against the potential gain. Fixing the server lags may very well require an effort comparable to launching a new season episode. In which case they simply won't do it, as it will affect far less players in a far smaller manner. That's all.
---
2) "Most people find it an issue" - citation needed.
---
3) "Vast majority of players find it a big issue" - citation needed.
---
4) And in PvE it has been the exact same meta since before PoF. Chrono/druid/banner warrior + dps. There will always be a single best composition for any given purpose and it will become the meta. You can try to shake things a bit by introducing viable alternatives - which ANet did in PvE in the form of Firebrand/Renegade pair - but actual changes tend to happen only when the meta is nerfed into oblivion. And even then not completely as we can see by the lfgs full of "chrono" despite the wrecking of the chaos chrono. Now I implore you, as a thought experiment, to imagine the outcry in WvW if ANet did anything even remotely resembling that nerf, to the Firebrand and the Scourge. 
---
content drought have always been there
---
they just advertised their hiring positions, I think.
---
What’s she gonna say? Oh I’m safe. Lol anyone in the business world knows you would never outright admit that while your coworkers won’t know if they have a paycheck next week
---
I really do not feel able to translate it, I do not express myself so well in English, I only have a Cambridge b1, thanks for reading =)
---
I haven’t player GW2 in a long time, but hearing this sucks. 
---
The future of MMORPGs doesn’t look good. We may be witnessing the beginning of the death of the genre. 
---
Maybe they are working on standalone expansion? Probably not likely. If it’s a new IP I’m kind of curious on what it will be (hopefully not some garbage mobile game).
---
Well they wont lay anything out, and if you ask on the forums they censor it. Thats the kind of company we're dealing with.
---
Well yeah that doesn't make it any better does it :P
---
I used to play a ton of WvW from launch to about 2015 or so. It really sucks to see the state of WvW nowadays, it doesn’t even look the same as it used to. 
---
I was curious the other day and I found out that my old server doesn’t even exist anymore. Did they merge a bunch of servers together at one point? I was on Sanctum of Rall 
---
You need to read the sub a bit more
---
Even if it's the marketing team it could still spell disaster for the game. Imagine the impact of a new marketing team intent on making more money out of the game and willing to use far more aggressive monetization. It could turn the game to "very unpleasant" in the span of few months.
---
No need to be polite cunt
---
They said during the PoF days that they had around 70 devs working on it, while 120 were working on the live game. Recent reports said they have 400 employees. I doubt they couldn't spare 70-ish like last time to work on the next expansion.
---
There never was official talk about an expansion.
---
i know there's different, and i'm saying we'll have a god legacy story at best and that there won't be a god story.
---
what makes you so sure it's a god story instead of their legacy besides "me want godz bagk"
---
Not at all, but almost every job supports society in some way. 
---
I don't have any hard sources, but someone else here on the subreddit said that a number of key developers, including some of those who originally worked on GW2's engine, left the company shortly after GW2 launched. So if they ever want to update the game's graphics or get more flexibility or anything like that... yeah, they're going to need a new engine.
---
For how old GW2 is, though, I... sort of doubt it'll get one.
---
If Guild Wars 2 shuts down, I'll finally have the free time to start on that massive gaming backlog.
---
I do not miss those godforsaken cash-only SMGs, but the rest of it was amazing and I've yet to find anything like it.
---
Nah, there are plenty of MMOs comming out in the next 2 years.
---
This is the best and the most accurate short but substantive description of the game state actually. 
---
The only thing which amazes me is that this subreddit keep downvoting such posts even when not having any counterarguments to them at all. That wouldn't make the game any better.
---
Awww, I think it's trying to communicate, how cute &lt;3
---
WvW annoncement were delayed because of bad job weather
---
Fellblade
---
&gt; laws that allow for things like capital gains tax rate being half of what normal people pay on money they make at a job.
---
A higher capital gains tax rate would be good but it wouldn't stop CEOs and investors from seeking to maximize their profit, even if it was at a lower rate. The basic incentive structures of capitalism are behind this.
---
Also lay offs -&gt; decreased moral of remaining workforce.
---
Jesus, why do you spend that much money? I just take coffee from the machine at work, costs nothing. Although I do bring my own honey to put in it.
---
k, next time you feel the need to write your verbale diaria that sawdust you call a brain comes up with make sure your conspiracy has more credibility then the flat earth theory and mind control vaccines
---
This response wasn't about pleasing people, it's about reassuring people that the plan hasn't changed. People hear layoffs and they're scared for the future of the game so they assure you they're still on track. And the "Few numbes of dedicated players?" I wouldn't call the million(s) of active players "Few" but hey. Those are just statistics speaking \^\^ 
---
https://kotaku.com/guild-wars-2-developer-arenanet-plans-for-mass-layoffs-1832799804
---
Second paragraph.
---
Yeah, I have to admit I would be off to WOW, ESO or FFXIV, or Anarchy online which I had a sub for over 10 years with. 
---
It isn't that GW2 is a bad game, I just feel the living world as the major source of new content isn't worth paying for. I ahve done the rest of the content in the game enough to not want to pay to do it over and over again.
---
This is the main reason the game will fail. People that have no faith.
---
&gt; LS isn't required by any means.
---
Well, they're a good source of ascended trinkets, which are pretty important for high level fractals at least.
---
Compared to the potential this game has, I would call it a few. Yeah people get new interests that's for sure. Assurance is not what the game needs, from my PoV
---
As if your post has any value
---
&gt; not BS mobile games that just waste money and generate no profit.
---
Take a look at [NCsoft's financial report](https://i.imgur.com/Mb3PR8S.jpg). The graphs are not to scale.
---
True, just saying. MMO comparisons are good and I think A.net should take a page out of how Yoshida handles giving information to the players and how they have a very stringent update schedule that they stick to. It has pros and cons but I think the pros outweigh the cons.
---
It's not just CoH, they cancelled "Tabula Rasa" to screw Richard Garriott out of what they owed him.  He sued and eventually got $20M+ in a court judgement against NCSoft.
---
They don't _need_ a reason to cancel a game, as they showed when they couldn't even be bothered to spin out the still-profitable CoH. 
---
You're talking like we're already dead. Piss off
---
Everyone knew since pof launch that after ls4 will come ls5, it was told hundreds of time and players keep the "expansion soon woo" 
---
I think them not knowing what comes next is far more likely than it being that the game is definitely dead, but this is concerning. 
---
I did mention to a friend a few weeks ago that I found the lack of expansion mentions (and season 5 immediately after 4) concerning - I wouldn't be surprised if you are indeed right and S5 marks the end. That said, I do still genuinely think that it's more likely that they simply don't know. 
---
I'm glad your self-reflection has reached illumination.
---
Someone got triggered 
---
&gt; iced lattee costs $6
---
For this price I hope it's at least 1 litre.
---
nah, tht's just how i talk when there's no need to be polite
---
back in the days when i still would tag up i sometimes lead a fun event titled nonsense raid that's wen we would try stuff like "we have 10 omega golems left so lets just take this tower totally down", so yes i have seen hill keep completely obliterated, same with spawn towers and bay. Fun fact we learned during one o thees raids: 15 Balistas = cata in time to take down a wall 
---
lol, get out.
---
I don't think that will help tbh. If they have to lay off people its already gotten bad to the point of no return.
---
and how did everybody knew back then?
---
hasnt anet taken over publishing for gw2  a few years ago \[[source](https://massivelyop.com/2015/09/01/pax-prime-2015-president-mike-obrien-addresses-rumors-about-business-model-and-the-arenanet-base-on-the-moon/?utm_content=bufferaa249&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer)\]?
---
The only comment I would have to the publishing thing, is that up until like a year ago (or maybe 2 years ago now), NCsoft had always done the publishing for GW2.
---
ANet had taken back the publishing only recently anyway.
---
Ncsoft is sound , anet not so much. This is a bigger deal then you think.
---
Expensive way to tell mediocre story.
---
welp.
---
Yea overall WoW is fine and if anything will be *helped* as they are investing more into WoW. It was shitty that the e-sports and the Publishing teams had layoffs but those layoffs had zero negative impact on game development. On the other hand what the NCSoft CEO said paints a very very grim picture for ANet.
---
Lets be honest here why the game has driven me away &amp; many others:
---
1. Other games are offering more content in expansions + DLC than GW2: ESO is offering a new expansion every year along with yearly DLC &amp; they announced they are adding another class to the games current 5 classes.
---
2. Necros still need alot of work 7 years later. This is just insane they are stull underpowered in PVE &amp; when they become balanced they get nerfed. Extreme turnoff. No class is as underpowered like that in ESO.
---
3. Where is Cantha ? First expansion should have been written to be set in Cantha or Elona so that we'd been on Cantha already.
---
4. The grind. ESO doesn't require as much grinding to earn ingame currency. Even if ESO offered a Gem to gold exchange i wouldn't ever need to use it. 
---
5. So many currency types that are account bound. Such a turn off. Alot of the various currencies to exchange for items during past living story seasons has pissed me off.
---
6. So many characters in the story i stopped caring about them, the games story lore appeals to just the hardcore players. GW1 story was fun to follow around withour it being overly detailed &amp; full of endless amounts of characters i don't care about.
---
7. The way they hyped up GW2 in GW1 by giving us samples of Norn forms &amp; Asura skills ended up disappointing, Norn aren't the best tanks in GW2 nor are Asura the best Eles cause the racial skills are almost useless &amp; the all race have the same stats.
---
8. Where is the Solo Farms ? GW1 had so many Solo farming builds for people who don't want to mess with group play cause of toxic experiences they had recently &amp; want to be away from group play for a while. 
---
9. Why is the endgame content just Raids/Fractals ? Dungeons should have better rewards etc to make them worthwhile again. They missed the chance to add a 'real UW' &amp; 'Real FoW' to the game, instead UW returns in the form of a 'raid'. Meh. I miss how there was always people doing dungeons in GW1, but in GW2 most of the dungeons are empty cause the rewards suck &amp; doesn't feel like end game content anymore.
---
10. Seems most of the content is focused on new weapon/glider/mount skins. Meh.
---
11. Why don't they update the engine &amp; add a ultra graphics tier with better textures/models ? Game is looking dated &amp; eventually even WoW will look better.
---
12. At this point they might as well add a optional sub fee for hardcore supporters that gives them a monthly amount of gems, extra storage/bag space, 10% boost to exp &amp; gold find. Maybe this will help them release expansions more often &amp; we finally get to Cantha.
---
Stop with the shitpost and end of the world spam, seriously.
---
I see EA just had big layoffs in one of their Australian studio's today. 
---
It's happening everywhere.
---
We do also have jumping puzzles and exploration, but those aren't as eh... repeatable? as combat.
---
True, but NCsoft is their corporate backers.
---
If they say no more money Anet has no choice.
---
No the main reason the game will fail is because of poor development processes, marketing, communication and monetisation 
---
\- Pick up supplies when you take camps or run by them, help build siege equipment, and let other man the siege (rams, and catapult mainly) if you do not possess the mastery for said device (can be traited in the WvW window at the bottom tab).  
---
\- Ignore the salty people who do nothing but complain  
---
\- Try and follow the instructions of the commander.  
---
joining the TS or discord for the commander's squad is not necessary, but appreciated. It might even help you understand certain things faster/better  
---
\- Just have fun and do your best to help, nobody expect you to know everything from the start, we all started as new people at some point.  
---
\- get some slighty tankier gear, full dps gear can be scary, especially as a first-timer
---
i said "god's aren't coming back" and you tried to argue against me so don't come backpedaling now with "you're misunderstanding i never said the gods are coming back"
---
fuck off
---
Being a former player of both coh and wildstar , I've played the both to the end. This is not a shit post. It's based on ncsoft track record which you obviously have no idea about.
---
Of course they would say that, if they actually came out and said sorry guys we have to scale back the game wouldn't last the month. 
---
I think that says more about you than her...
---
They are generating a decent profit.
---
Its just not enough for corporate to be happy.
---
I have zero interest in FF, or Elder Scrolls or Warcraft.
---
I'll be done with mmo's if this game folds I suppose.
---
Dude, Wildstar's revenue wasn't even listed anymore in NCSofts earning reports for years because it was so low. And yet they dragged it along all this time before shutting down. You can't reallyy compare that to GW2 (yet).
---
\&gt; Management is focused on maximizing profits for their shareholders, not us gamers. 
---
A.k.a GW2 is a product. Which means, we, consumers, should treat it as any other product: like the toilet paper you buy, or the internet you get from your provider.
---
Thus:
---
\&gt;  Buy Gems because you appreciate the game, not because people are saying  the sky is falling.  And be sure to say thanks to the Devs when you see  them on social media.  They work hard to make us happy, regardless of  when we complain about game stuff. 
---
So the child making your t-shit in Bangladesh makes how much per hour?
---
Yes, A.Net and NCSoft are financially sound and they will be fine. GW2 is a business for them. It doesn't seem to be a business for us. Maybe if it was, producers would be forced to create decent products that would compete for our attention, rather than sell more lootboxes.
---
okay.
---
There's no evidence that all of those were mobile games or that those mobile games would've generated no profit if they had been released. There's a much higher demand for mobile games these days, so a mobile game gamble makes logical business sense (even with the risk of not delivering).
---
When is the stream?
---
&gt; Yoshida and his team make quality content
---
*looks over at Eureka and BLU*
---
What.
---
Definitely. They'll have no choice.
---
A much lower capital gains tax pushes people into more investments in the stock market which means less investments in other things. Those other things could be competing startup businesses that would treat employees better. 
---
I agree maximizing profits is the heart of capitalism but I think we'd have more competition with less government intrusion which would be better for consumers and workers. 
---
Sigh.
---
You stated:

&gt; Technically it could be, and they're just brushing up for ALL gods. We're likely to see Melandru, Lyssa, Kormir, and Abaddon in the coming days.
---
I said "it could be" in reply to "I doubt it means the return of the gods".
---
Meaning that these tweets could be hinting at the return of the gods.
---
There's no backpedaling to be had. And calm the fuck down.
---
You can't catch me (anymore).
---
WvW rework soon huh....

---
You're talking universal basic income which is different than just straight communism where it doesn't matter what you do or how much as everyone gets the same amount but even that still has it's downsides the same as raising the minimum wage. 
---
What i'm guessing is that there was going to be  at least some more depth to what the maps had to offer, but it got cut and downsized to accomodate the team size and time.
---
Indeed. The fact that Arenanet didn't announce anything until after the press already had speaks volumes. I think NCSoft genuinely caught them off guard with this. 
---
How many of them will fizzle out over the first few months or 1-2 years? Or be pay to win bullshit? It seems to happen a lot in MMOs. 
---
I would take anything Jessica price says with allot of salt.
---
She talked a ton of crap &amp; made up stuff on her employer before Anet after they fired her, chances are she is doing the same.
---
no it's not calm down
---
Depends if you want to continue to devote time to a time that is slowly in a spiral downwards. Cause make no mistake GW2 is never going to improve.
---
Dragged it along all this time ? It lasted 4 years , and ncsoft pulled the pull.
---
" **Yoon added that the company plans to “cut costs across the organization” and restructure across the board, merging ArenaNet and NCSoft’s publishing divisions in the process.**  "
---
Pay to win features incomming, because literally the only game that ncsoft owns and doesnt have pay to win features is Gw2, now im sure that merging the publishing divisions will most definitely change that scenario, i always was a little cautious about gw2 because they had NCSOFT with them.
---
But surprisely for the years that i played gw2 ncsoft doesnt looked to push the game into wierd directions as far from monatization.
---
From a company side eyes Gw2 need a better monatization mode, so i think one of two things will happens: 
---
MAJOR CHANGES ON THE MONATIZATION METHODS, 
---
or
---
MAINTENENCE MODE.
---
Sad but i cant see other way this is going.
---
They said so multiple times
---
Honestly, I think this might be the truth or at least a part of it. Given how similar to each other the episodes are and how long we have to wait for them, I wouldn't be surprised if the devs were indeed working on something else. I just cannot imagine that they're not bored of their current approach themselves and, let's be honest here, if it took a their employees such a long time to make such content, it would mean that it costs a lot (people times months). I doubt they pay a lot for this copy-paste content.
---
Her "victims", could you be more pathetic... 
---
 did you report me for being a trans person playing your game? geez...grow up. its 2019. games are not only for white teenage boys anymore
---
thanks for these! i will add them to the main post, just woke up and got to work! 
---
are you replying to a ghost?
---
&gt; Maybe if it was, producers would be forced to create decent products that would compete for our attention, rather than sell more lootboxes.
---
Like what? Please provide examples because they create great outfits, mount skins and weapons and that is clearly not enough. Lootboxes make money and obviously money is what they need right now.
---
If you want to be pedantic, everything is in a downward spiral. Every game will eventually cease to get support eventually, and your own death or even change of interests will make your gaming ultimately irrelevant.
---
Doesn't mean you shouldn't enjoy yourself while it lasts.
---
Thanks for pointing my typo.  Corrected it.
---
Er no
---
Its also based on the word of someone who talked crap &amp; made up shit about former employers when they fired her.
---
Since anet fired her my bet is she is doing the same.
---
She is a very bitter angry person after all.
---
I suspect they haven't actually started on expansion development yet, so no scraps to use there.
---
Really, really hard to say what will happen. On one hand, I'm genuinely incredibly impressed with what they achieved with PoF and that \*should\* give me a pretty strong reason to be optimistic. On the other hand, the way ArenaNet's update is worded almost makes me suspect they're not even sure about LS5 just yet. 
---
where? i've never seen it stated anywhere before the announcement that there wouldn't be an xpac between season 4 and 5
---
Congratulations, all. This is a really well executed kill. Deaxon on chrono is truly a sight to behold.
---
Stop, just stop. Your ignorance is showing...
---
You do realize I can reverse your edit to see you told me to kill myself right?
---
You know nothing mate, keep your ignorance, I'm not gonna change your mind.
---
added to the main post! thanks!
---
You should take a good look at yourself. You probably got bullied a lot and try to vent your frustration through the anonymos internet. Take a fuckin break from whatever you are doing Jesus Christ
---
2 LS releases recently took 4-5 months to release
---
Spoken like a true blind sheep. That thinks games are funded by f2p white knights and unicorn shit.
---
I try not to worry, but after what NCsoft did to City of Heroes a few years ago it’s hard not to be a little scared.
---
I’m sure GW2 is currently doing better than CoH was when it shut down, but who knows. I still miss that game. :(
---
Or he knows GW2 players on Reddit generally aren't very bright or objective so focus on irrelevant fluff rather than the meat of what she says. ;)
---
New account that edited their post twice and thinks they're funny. Original reply to my K was kys. Lmao. Downvote and ignore.
---
no amount of underfunding justifies the hilariously incompetent marketing campaigns such as teaming up with an obscure american tea company or a scripted friendships campaign. Nor does it justify the conscious decision to continue the release cycle of quarterly content that lasts for about 3 hours instead of investing in content with actual longevity such as raids, fractals, or more difficult open world content
---
Thank you.
---
If by developers you mean programmers, that's perfectly fine. In most IT companies I know only around half of a team is made of programmers and the rest are QA engineers and business analysts. And you still need some devops, administrators and so on. In the game dev industry you also need graphic designers, writers, people responsible for sounds and music etc. 
---
Also, given how simple the story and missions are, they don't really have to spend a lot of time coding. Assuming they don't have to code everything from scratch, which they shouldn't because they ought to have developed some tools or frameworks.
---
Adding these to the main post, thank you!
---
Coh/v was profitable though. Sure not mega bucks but for the cost vs reward, coh/v was often above the costs. 
---
&gt; No need to be polite cunt
---
Hmmmm...
---
Nowhere in the article you linked is it mentioned that they're laying off 33% of staff. Where the hell did you pull that number from, because that's absolutely insane.
---
Also there was no information anywhere about Anet not "earning enough to be financially solvent".
---
Jesus fucking Christ, people. Stop panicking and spreading bullshit rumors.
---
Such a well put-together response! Appreciate it, I will definitely consider all of this
---
why would i stop when i'm enjoying myself here.
---
LOL, WvW would like to have a word with you about being the least supported game mode.
---
You can pay real money to play it though
---
While that through-line makes sense in how it's presented, I would be wary of what I would trust from JP. She has a pretty heavy chip on her shoulder and it makes any info from her incredibly biased and that can effect info reliability.
---
Yes because all profitable companies have layoffs. Gw2 has been dieing for a while. This 100% completely confirms it from the buisness side.
---
Yeah but where do they generate this revenue? Not really in the west... So where is the point in throwing mobile games on the marked? Especially after we've seen the backlash on Blizzard after their mobile announcement.
---
I can't say I like NCSoft... I just hope that they've seen what happened to Blizzard after their announcement and were thinking "Hm... Maybe we shouldn't do this in the west then..."
---
Isn't capitalism fun
---
If what a certain individual is spouting is even half true then they were already running GW2 on maintenance mode, basically leaving a skeleton crew behind while most of them worked on other projects. This would definitely explain the huge delays between releases and the fact that only one area of the game seemed like it was still being worked on, I don't think it's wise to assume that they will all suddenly start supporting this game properly again, time will tell.
---
Can you explain your group division ? Why 7/3 and not 8/2 or 6/4 or 5/5 ?
---
Great work by the way =)
---
From the log, Mag bomb represented 18-23% of the boss damage from the Daredevils. 
---
They are pretty strong, but Improv itself is worth mostly if the phases are shorter, emphasizing heavier burst from the bombs. In long phases, you'd probably still benefit from Executioner or Improv pretty evenly.
---
I just really got into this game the past month. DAMN~
---
Support is not unconditional. Cutting back on development in areas of the game many players cared about makes it more difficult to support anet in good faith.
---
Perhaps ncsoft will have better priorities. Perhaps not. But anet has made it abundantly clear that they will stick to 3 hours of fluff content over anything repeatable. And i for one am not interested in paying for that. 
---
Stop pulling information out of your ass. [Season 4 has already been more profitable than Season 3](https://imgur.com/a/hY5ed0F), that's the exact opposite of dying.
---
Damn, thats truly impressive
---
U can just wiki it, but in general they are still subsidiary company. 
---
The first thing that popped to my mind is this Jimquisition video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmW0GhdDOvw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmW0GhdDOvw)
---
There have been prevalent fears of a declining game since at least PoF.  
---
Remember this was their "content focused" expansion that failed to produce as much gameplay value as HoT, which was even excused as their "feature based" expansion. The #1 complaint about PoF has been its lasting value, the result of lackluster rewards and event design.  
---
We saw multiple gaps of 8+ months between raids being added, with prominent members of that community speaking out about how this slow pace has had a huge blow on player interest. DnT for example recently [announced their "retirement" from raiding](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aibtpo/dnt_retiring_from_raiding_in_gw2/) as a result.  
---
Likewise, a new fractal being introduced every 6-9 months isn't enough to maintain that community.  
---
With nearly every living story episode one of the major complaints is that it only brings players back for a few days, then it's back to waiting 3-4 months for the next update.  
---
WvW and PvP communities have pretty much accepted that ANet doesn't want to properly support those areas of the game.  
---
The entire game at this point feels like it's on life support. Content has become stale and predictable, there is nothing exciting in sight, and they are doing nothing to maintain serious player interest.  
---
They should have invested more in making PoF a full expansion, and finding ways to appeal to players whilst monetizing more, imo. Instead, they've driven players off by underinvesting in the game that was making what money they had.
---
I haven't quit yet, but I probably won't buy anything with cash from the shop *until* I see a reinvestment into GW2. I realise they're a business and can do as they please, but I also have been happy to whale around for several hundred dollars a month in the past, because I still do care about this company and game-- but I won't support them when their investment in GW2 lately has been at quite a minimum.
---
So what? This guy kept his facade with a snarky comment when he just didn't had enough balls
---
Season 4 will end around april and even with a smooth release speed, we will end season 5 deep into 2020 the earliest. Even if there is a third expansion on the way (and if GW2 is supposed to carry on, there has to be), you shouldnt expect anet to announce it earlier than the end of this year. We are customers, not share holders.
---
ANet is also at fault, imo.
---
I think this can be salvaged, but we'll see how they reconfigure and retool from here.
---
PC gaming future is fine. There were years when everyone was screaming "PC gaming is dead". Right now PC gaming is the same % of the market as console gaming.
---
translation: gaem is ded, get back to your lives
---
But if you read Price's comments (might be true, might not) then those devs were GW2 devs that have been silently moved to other projects and now are being let go. So GW2 has actually been losing devs this whole time and all the gem purchases have been going to funding these other projects. 
---
They do generate this revenue in the west. Activision-Blizzard is actually [a great example of this](https://media.pocketgamer.biz/2019/2/95386/atvi-bookings-platform2014-2018500-r471x.png). This is just bookings, and mobile games cost much less to develop than PC and console games. Their mobile division is making bank, and that's what prompted the higher ups to snag the Diablo mobile game. The issue with Diablo Immortal isn't that it's a mobile game, but that there's no good market for it. The Diablo demographic isn't the mobile demographic. Using another IP would've solved that issue.
---
We know that they’ve been working on the next expansion?
---
You do realize that...
---
1. This is the kind of talk that will shut the game down. People will panic and find a new MMO.
---
2. ArenaNet has said that the developers being laid off are ones working on other, unannounced projects that have been canned.
---
Just because it's more profitable then last season doesn't mean it's making a net profit , if it was they wouldn't be having layoffs. Ncsoft is all about money. 
---
They do sometimes read here. In my case, I have been a whale in the past but have drastically reduced my spending because I don't like the direction they've been going in. If they start going back to a focus on expansions, more content-driven maps, etc, I will open my wallet again.
---
&gt; We have a supply and demand market so if the market isn't supporting something it's an indication of an oversupply with lack of demand.
---
There are tons of caveats to a supply and demand market that you're ignoring. You're also ignoring the short term vs long term investment.
---
&gt; If the people getting laid off enjoy this so much i'm certain that game companies would welcome them to volunteer their free time!
---
I don't know if you realize this but most game developers could actually make considerably more money while working less hours if they got some other software development job that they are equally qualified for. People are already taking a pay cut in order to work on games because they really do love it. That doesn't mean that they don't need to pay rent and buy food though.
---
&gt; In a capitalist society we can adjust wages to entice people to take jobs that aren't fun, how does that work in a communist society?
---
That would depend on the particular implementation but plenty of socialist and communist varieties still have markets, they just abolish the role of the capital owner and have businesses owned by those who run them. So it would do the same thing just fine, the difference would be that the business wouldn't being laying people off to ensure some already rich fuckwad gets a marginally larger dividend payout and would instead be tied to the success of the business overall, not just dividends and stock price which is actually a very narrow view.
---
You'll also notice I didn't just say fun, but also meaningful. Plenty of people are able to derive satisfaction from a job you might not consider nominally "fun". In fact, a lot of roles that are important to society already don't have the profit motive applied and still get done.
---
So we are talking about the Guild Wars Battle Royal game again? Or a TCG set in the GW universe? Maybe even a single player GW game?
---
I don't like the idea taking an MMO and pushing it to another genre just because it's the new hot thing on the market. Well, I don't like that idea for any type of game. There is also a very small window of opportunity when it comes to new trends in gaming. Either you release something with good quality quickly after this trend rises, or you better let it pass.
---
You can't kill something that's already dead lol. The older content needs a revamp, there's no new content, nothing to work for except pointless shiny skins, there's no incentive to play unless you're leveling alts for some reason. Game is dead at this state. Everyone needs to admit it.
---
Yes, but layoffs and restructuring specifically means that they're *not* shutting down games. That's the whole point.
---
Which is one of the reasons I am not worried. Sure, if NCSoft pulls the plug, it will be a major blow. But I have a feeling if that happens, ArenaNet will still work on the game - though with a much smaller stuff/budget.
---
She's not wrong though.  It happens in companies all the time.  The wrong ones get laid off and the execs get off scot free.
---
Too sexy
---
If they do not announce an expansion soon enough the game basically enters maintenance mode, its like Dungeons.
---
Thats also the same type of vibe I got from this Anet tweet. It is not reassuring and it doesn't communicate anything other than confirming there will be LW5 right after LW4 - which we knew about it anyway. And by the rate things are going I expect LW5 to finish within 2 years so after that they have nothing, said nothing, planned nothing really. If they are planing on an expansion the time to start it would be now, 2 or 1year and a half prior, because it helps moderate and adjust the narrative etc etc. But yeah, very concerning stuff... I will also be here till the end.
---
Investor != player.  Take it easy over there, Warren Buffet.
---
&gt; I don't mind busywork, provided it isn't an enormous pain in the ass. But if I grind too much of it out, then it starts to weigh on me. And as of late, I've been doing too much of it.
---
Yeah, I hear you on that. Same here. But that's why I said they're just not as repeatable. That's just the thing with puzzles, they're about figuring them out, but you can never really go back to not having figured them out, while skills you can maintain and keep training to be just a bit better at.
---
from a first look they put the 4 dps daredevils in one Group with the kiter and the tankchrono. this would lead to have the 4 daredevils buffed with glyph and spotter at the legendaries as the tankchrono and kiter arent in range for the buffs
---
It does.
---
“We don’t have enough skin to make this doublet, I’ll go get more-“
---
“Nah I’ve got this”
---
GW2 doesn't have an energy system that you can pay money to ignore. GW2 does not make exceedingly difficult content that you cannot progress past until you either get stupid lucky or you pay for power-ups/continues that will allow you to finally move forward and continue with the game. GW2 doesn't require the acquisition (i.e. purchase with real-world money) of new cards/characters/monsters to continue playing through the story or to remain remotely competitive in PvP or other whatever ranking system exists in the game.  GW2 isn't perfect, but it's nowhere near as bad as a lot of mobile games.
---
Belgium banned loot boxes that you could buy with real money (that applies to the RNG mount license adoption), even if you can also buy them with in-game currency, under their gambling legislation so at some point (no sure if it's still the case?) player from Belgium would not get access to those RNG licenses and even from buying gems gems for a short time.
---
So at least 1 country in Europe thinks it's gambling.
---
I do not understand how they are understaffed at all those positions then they have (or had) ~400 people working on the game while other games (wow for example) have barely 200.
---
She is either lying or AN is completely inefficient, needing 3 people to do the job of 1.
---
Self fulfilling prophecy or not, after that announcement they have ensured I won't be spending money in the gem store. Why would you spend money while it's up in the air? Spend $30 just to be told it's closing in a month. 
---
It's kind of like restaurant employees not being told the restaurant is closing until the day it closes. The restaurant doesn't want everyone to quit until they close for good. It's the same with GW2. They want you to spend in the gem store until the last minute.
---
So we have the words of a twitter sexist and you applying your bible-study mental gymnastics to a corporate announcement. 
---
Great!
---
Look at Activision and CoD. EA and BFV. Doesn't matter how much the game is selling, only investors matter. COD sold extremely well last year yet it was still disappointment for investors.
---
Telling people not to trust a sociopath is somehow a bad thing in your mind? how?
---
“You get to miss the vast majority of the content with each expansion” is what I heard
---
Nothing and no one ever said there will be an expansion.
---
It was announced and released really fast.
---
Sure people knew it was coming next and there were few leaks, but the whole "This is what weve been doing and its going to be released in 2 months!" was surprise.
---
Seeing how usually stuff like this is announced 6-12 months before (like WoW does)
---
They had confirmed that there would be LW5 straight after LW4 since August with their anniversary trailer, this isn't any big news tbh. But yeah this means that LW5 will be completed in roughly a year and a half or 2 by the time it starts, so brace yourselves.
---
Nice, and when we need more content updates....
---
Just start a new character from scratch, preferably different race from whatever yu last played. 
---
Fully immerse yurself in the world and try to map complete. 
---
Not even close.
---
Misandry apologism. Nice!
---
They should just have finished those projects, that's what should have happened. 
---
I mean, as a consumer that buys games to have fun, paid-for mount and weapon skins or outfits isn't exactly what I'd consider a good deal. As you are aware, GW2 is a product as it's meant to make money. But we, as consumers, aren't obligated to throw money their way:  our money needs to be earned.
---
The reason why I mentioned lootboxes (paying for a chance to get the item you want) is because they are so utterly consumer-unfriendly and exploitative that they just surpass all other issues with how A.Net treats its customers. One doesn't need to mention then that we are dealing with a game, where the endgame is vanity but then so much of this type of progression is limited to the cash shop, and players are stuck grinding for gold, a currency that can actually also be bought. It's simply unsatisfying as a game.
---
We already knew LW5 was to happen right after LW4 ever since August and their anniversary trailer. This post really didn't confirm or reassure anything tbh.
---
Ah I’m used to getting bad advice from vets when I first get into a game, thanks for the warm welcome
---
Sad to see this is still an issue. I remember running around the temple trying to interact with different things and killing things, and I returned here on many occasions to get the event to show up. On my last attempt I finished interacting with something on the northwestern poi. I think I charged some golems somehow. Didn't seem to do anything so I ran back to the middle to alt tab search the internet once more for a solution. I alt tabbed back in a couple minutes later to find the event I was looking for appear. Not sure if charging the golems did anything but Orr has some really buggy events that really need some poking and prodding.
---
The game isn't shutting down. The company behind development of the game, ArenaNet, has to lay off a number of people as requested by their publisher, NCSoft, to continue to remain profitable.
---
The company will have definitely taken a hit, but we've been assured that the game will continue running with a regular update cadence and that future plans for the game haven't been cancelled.
---
This isn't NcSoft killing the game, it's Anet that has slowly killed the game with their incompetence. Slow pace of releasing fuck all content, being incredibly bad at advertising the game since its release and pouring most of their development time in single player content. 
---
I wasn't referring to a NCSoft mobile game in the west but the general popularity of mobile games in the west. Traditional gamers underestimate the popularity of mobile games^1 , but mobile gamers actually outnumber traditional gamers, even in the west.  
---
&gt; I assume you were talking about Hearthstone from Blizzard, right?  
---
No, I wasn't talking about Hearthstone at all. That screenshot from my previous comment is one of Activision-Blizzard's mobile games, Legend of Solgard. It's a completely new franchise and IP. They've got a few mobile games, but the most iconic one is probably Candy Crush. Yes, the top-level management behind Candy Crush is the same top-level management behind Diablo. The success of their mobile division explains why they're trying to churn out new mobile games and why other large game studios are following them.
---
[1] I know of a few theories why that is: Mobile gamers are more casual and less likely to interact on communities. The average mobile gamer is in their 40's or older.
---
be careful what you wish for...
---
So it's Jessica Price's account.
---
I mean, sure. by why support bigots?
---
Anytime someone unironically uses 'cuck' in a sentence, I can tell they have nothing of value to say.
---
When was the last content added to gw1 ?.. how many people you think are working on it ?
---
Ohhh no no! This only happens in EoTM (Edge of the Mists) - but nobody goes there anymore because you don't get pips, so there's no point.
---
There read this one, i think it will help more - Read the skirmishes section and then right under it the Matchmaking section, and ask me again if you have more questions :D 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/World_versus_World#Skirmishes
---
I am not sure if I reach the same conclusion from that.
---
GW2 is a strong and stable source of income, but it is old and not getting any newer. Of course ArenaNet has to invest in developing new projects for the future as well. That is a pretty normal path to take, and doesn't mean a lack of faith in GW2, but just being realistic about the future.
---
That's not what i said. How  lame a troll are you?
---
Where the management fuck up, the rest of the company pays the price while they sit there calculating how to buy a bigger boat. This is on the board, not on the neck of any of those who will pay for it. 
---
People keep saying this in spite of us knowing next to nothing about these projects. As much as I love gw2 and want it to get all the developmentattention it can get, exclusivly holding onto an ageing Mmo and not working on potential other titles is a ludicrous position to take as a developer and a short sighted one to suggest/demand as a consumer. We don't know what the discontinued projects were, what didn't work out with them, how far along they were, etc. All we assumed with any certainty and now have confirmation on is that such projects existed. And if anet is to survive longterm there will be again. 
---
What's Kotaku bigoted about, exactly?
---
My character Zero and her guild the Gendarran Free Company (Roleplaying Guild on Piken Square) explore Deldrimor ruins in search of a lost supply crate of Dragonsblood Spears in preparation of the campaign against Kralkatorrik and The Branded.
---
No frenzy on skillbar :(
---
Yes but GW1 has significantly less content, content variation and back end programming than GW2 so naturally GW2 has taken longer and needed more resources to develop.
---
Every game was once a project which made no money while it cost money. Some get released, some don't.
---
You don't know anything about the projects behind the scenes - maybe they only just got started and NCSoft is stepping in early to cut them off. There is no evidence available publicly to support any of your claims.
---
Oh hey you're back.
---
I'm still here for some of the people and part of their product. I wont support anet because they wont support these aspects of the product nor these people no matter how much support I provide.
---
You can buy gems all you like but i wouldn't count on more pvp, wvw or raids. If you want to support LS then go ahead. I'm told casual players are the real spenders. Time to put their money where their mouth is. 
---
The people hating on Price seem to have more of an axe to grind than her and are being more dramatic to boot, all whilst accusing her of the same thing.  Definite hypocrisy there.
---
On that side, where it says things like "Whiteside Ridge + Vabbi", does this mean that Vabbi is piggy-backing onto WR or they act as one? They're all grouped in threes, but the + (other server) bit confuses me.
---
I find this all genuinely very confusing and that's half the reason I've only ever gone into WvW for dailies and a bit of an explore. 
---
dude, when you would even slightly follow the mmo news (and understand them) than you would know that NCSoft itself is not doing good atm. they are losing market share and money all over the place and anet simply didnt delivered one of their mobile apps/games/whatever. thats why they get cut.
---
It reassures there is somebody who posts on the forum /s
---
They had no idea back then of what ncsoft was about to announce to them
---
&gt;  If it’s a new IP I’m kind of curious on what it will be (hopefully not some garbage mobile game).
---
I thought all other projects had been dropped or was that just rumours?
---
Which game are you referring to? I wanna play THAT!
---
&gt; That on one hand sounds good for Guild Wars but if JP twitter posts are true, a ton of GW2 devs had already been moved off 
---
Is there literally anyone out there who wasn't expecting just that to happen? That's how literally every single MMO dev/publisher had done before, maybe with the exception of ff14, so that's a deeply entrenched industry standard. 
---
The Problem for me is That i only get to hear bad news like No Expansion and layoffs. But i never get to hear whats maybe in the Pipeline or what is planned for the Game. and That is very discouraging at least for me to have faith in the Game as a whole. 
---
Lets hope the other project being worked on is guild wars 3
---
Shareholders are little more than parasites
---
It's not really on us. NCsoft has done this before.
---
What NCSOFT did to City of Heroes.  While In the middle of working on the next release closing it down entirely even though it was a profitable game. ArenaNet &amp; Paragon Studios deserved better.

They have no information on what they are working on?
---
&gt;  It's sort of like right now, where we know that they've been working on the next expansion, but there are no details on it
---
No we do not know that at all. PoF was not as well recieved as HoT and it's not farfetched to think a third expansion would do worse than PoF.
---
We don't know what they're working on, We know they had/have other games in the pipeline but as for an expansion, we don't know anything.
---
Last I checked it was several hundred million.
---
Granted their corporate overlords were wanting allot more.
---
Its basically the same thing that happened at Blizzard, they generated decent income but corporate wanted more and to get more is going to lay off everyone possible to get it.
---
any financial bad news for EA is good news, thou my heart still goes out to the people affected
---
Yeah we really need some claryfication asap.
---
She said a number of things about former coworkers &amp; bosses.
---
Allot of it was stuff I won't repeat here but feel free to look it up on her timeline (if she hasn't deleted it)
---
the issue I see with all these maps is that they aren't necessarily always high quality (gotta meet the deadlines), and often times feel pretty dead depending on which map you go to because there aren't a whole lot of reasons to revisit them (imo).
---
that doesn't mean I don't want to see new maps, I do, but maybe dial it back a bit and instead release maps that are much higher quality with higher replay value.
---
Corporate greed. Capitalism.
---
That wasn't the point made in the post I was responding to. 
---
In theory I'm all for this, but in practice this would probably just mean hitting the wrong button more often =P
---
Well yeah, companies need to work on new projects. That is how it works dude. 
---
Wonder what it would take for ArenaNet to separate from NCSoft altogether...
---
Successful meaning dropping 90% of players and having the devs come out to beg the community to stick with them after failing in the home region... yeah unfortunately not
---
Nah. The panic and speculation spread like a wildfire, and in reality the game or its updates or future content won't be affected in any way.
---
The worst thing for the game right now is speculation just like this thread.
---
How is this considered an update? xD Doesn't say anything, literally. We already know that they are going straight for LW4 to LW5.
---
I was merely stating that Legion had a good developement cycle of content. That does not solve all of your MMORPG's problems such as further and further reduction in class design, accessibility going too far etc.
---
I for one thought Legion was a slight course correction, a "modern WoW paradigm shift" to show where the game was headed. BFA showed me that that's not the case and it was an accident at best. Kinda sad.
---
Would you rather it take a long time and be great or come out instantly and be crap?
---
You don't usually neglect your active products though, which is what is being implied here.
---
&gt; Anet should just focus on GW2 and no be bled dry by side projects which generate no profit and only drain resources.
---
Companies cannot do that, that is unsustainable 
---
From before the drama? Taking it remotely serious seems fine.
---
After the drama? OP is a dummy.
---
And this doesn't sound like something you'd mention before being fired. So I have to assume the latter.
---
I can play the game while realising its declining and hating the direction in which it continues to go. 
---
Although I obviously play and support less.
---
Why would that be bad, do you not have phone?
---
People were stopping playing before now because of content delivery issues. This is just another nail. 
---
I wonder if it means that we are finally going to get some development map for 2019/2020? 
---
SWTOR laid off 33% of their staff six months after launch. It's still up and running. This doom and gloom is amazing.
---
They said they're going to continue to support the game with updates.  They said no update is being cancelled.
---
It's fine to get back into the game.
---
If you're on a US server and you want some help getting back in, hit me up in game on Vayne.8563. I help a lot of returning players get back into the game.
---
Yes and no. It all depends on their next move

It's GREAT, the combat is amazing in this game... but it has issues.

**sPvP**
---
There are 5v5 arenas, where knowing your class, having map awareness and good tactics is very important.
---
There's ranked were you get teams close to your rank, so (in theory) close to your experience. This doesn't always work great, but it's better than the randomness of unranked.
---
**WvW**
---
There's also World vs World, where 3 servers fight each other on big open maps and they siege castles, towers, etc. You can either roam by yourself, or with a small group and look for fights, or follow a commander and join large scale fights.
---
**Note:** there's no PvP in open world PvE. You can't kill other players there. If you want open world PvP you go to WvW, if you want small structured matches you go to regular PvP (sPvP.

Guess not
---
capitalism is one hell of a drug
---
Where's the next expansion, what's the plan moving forward.
---
Some of the most repeatable content is PvP based but it sees so few updates, it's a total waste.
---
WvW is an incredibly unique element of MMOs and PvP in games right now and should be better taken care of to pull in all the true RvR players.
---
You need to spend money to make money, not reduce systems down to skeleton teams because they seem to be declining, keep the teams you have, but add people with fresh ideas and innovation and keep innovating on the basic model that is in-place with PvP and WvW.
---
**Add PvP maps, add different gamemodes, add larger team modes, add restricted class modes. Add 9v9 with one of each profession allowed.**
---
**Add a 3rd map to WvW, bring back tournaments, bring back server pride, add gem store items to promote and support that server pride.**
---
Hello, I am working on Elementalist PoF weapon collection achievement "Warpblade". There is one item for which you need to kill the skritt with his treasure. I ran into this few times when completing PoF story but i never actually killed him. Can it be done solo? Is this event random, i think it spawned when opening some chest so i can start this event when i want? :) Wiki is not available for me now sadly :(
---
Wildstar got the pull plugged because the maintenance and server online costs exceeded the projected income (no it doesnt cost a nickel, IT infrastructure contract work has some monetary OOMPF behind it).
---
GW2 however can carry itself and does some profits, while meager. This is why Anet doesnt have to worry about this IP for now. However they need to look into further monetization options. If they done that is not up to us tho.
---
And you can also find a game you like more and want to support and play that. Sounds better for everyone!
---
your point?
---
i know of the vid but i wanted to see his "earlier post from the AMAs"
---
Exactly. It was telling when, as soon as HoT came out they outright stated that they were planning the next expansion.
---
PoF release? No mention of any future expansions at all.
---
Not to mention the whole 'living world can get expansion level content' thing.
---
Because of leaks only!
---
We already knew that they merged teams.
---
But tell me, does this not sound like someone is still sour graping?
---
"Which is, of course, how this always goes. They'll keep failing upward, as male game execs do, and the people who poured their lives and souls into making something they loved will struggle."
---
my post was not speculation - I made no assumptions. I merely asked a question.
---
Inquiring != speculation
---
That I agree with you, you're not OP.
---
Nah I think I'll stay around for the drama and quality content that this game continues to provide. I'm already hyped for Tuesday!!!
---
The author of the article also pulls this information out of her ass it seems, because there are no sources for it and no other articles mention it.
---
NCsoft ended Wildstar and CoH because nobody was playing them and they weren't profitable enough. Neither of that is true for GW2. If they're going to shut down games, then GW2 is not nearly the first in line at the chopping block, because NCsoft has other games that are less profitable.
---
&gt; Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2 game services will not be affected, nor is **any upcoming game content** canceled. 
---
Is it being too optimistic to read that as a reference to a potential expansion pack? That'd mean the canceled stuff was either a mobile game or something entirely new, like GW3 or a ArenaNet's battle royale. ;)
---
Can you please tell me which JPs fit into this category?
---
It will make me play WvW again for a month or two. So I think it's a good addition even if it's not "what WvW needs right now". 
---
It's a really good move to lock a mount behind WvW content in my opinion. It's a mistake made by ANet to allow players to easily obtain rewards from other game modes without actually playing them. 
---
how about gw2?
---
Okay. Then got of the pot. Stop complaining and turning people off to the game.
---
lol ded game, haha xD
---
You're right. It all looks grim and we have to be honest. The first exp was released 2015, 2nd 2017 and logically the 3rd one should come this year but it will not. It will take another 1.5 years as you said for the s5 story to finish (hopefully not more) and Anet to get their shit together and possibly from that point we might have a future for guild wars. 
---
Isles have a healthy population. A lot of people come for both of the events and then gather stuff with the event buff/banners. Slightly less than in Malchor's but still quite a lot.   
---
Kourna on the other hand is just un-redeemable shit. 
---
got a bit of a mixed message, thx for clearing it up
---
If they are going back to the old cadence where the only new content were new LS episodes ( just like GW at launch ) then I wont give it more money because that was the reason I quited GW2 at launch ( no cool content only LS ).
---
I just hope that now when those "project" are cancelled ANet will move more people to WvW/PvP/Fractal and Raid content. Especially WvW. It's what GW2 probably does best of all MMOs. Development cycle for WvW is so slow I wonder how many people are actually working on it currently? 5?
---
Because WvW is the pinnacle of intelligent gameplay...
---
The funny thing about that is they added more kinds of unique, repeatable content (sab, Halloween and Christmas events, queen's Festival, silverwastes, teq rework, dungeon reworks, fractals basic form, ls2 challenge motes, ascended gear) between base game and hot than between hot and pof. Most of hot was said to be laying the groundwork for the future (i.e. Gliding, map meta, adventures, raids, etc.) of which only map meta panned out and raids are on life support and a far cry from their promise of supporting it. Im glad at least specialisations came with pof but that's about all they did with the groundwork and added more new things like mounts, which while good, do not come close to what the base game and hot offered. Heck even hot is starting to look good compared to the lack of meaningful things provided by pof
---
&gt;won't gain anything from it but she will possibly hurt them which to her mind is a gain for her.
---
This is *exactly* the MO for social justice warriors such as she. Sling enough shit at that which you oppose/feel you've been oppressed by, and relatively you'll feel better about yourself.
---
Are we going back to GW2 at launch where the only content was new LS episodes? Thats the reason many people found GW2 to boring
---
God forbid he criticise something he has an interest in.
---
You can like a game but hate it's potential future/parts of it.
---
I love PvP combat in GW2 and I haven't bought anything in a while because I don't want to support the neglect of it as a game mode that ANET has shown.
---
I still think its mostly a brilliant game, but you don't support it blindly. If you are happy with the way the product releases content for you as a consumer then fine, but I am not, so I refuse to give my monetary vote. 
---
Think of it like this, you can have a friend you love dearly and refuse to pay for their drug habits, because you don't agree with them. It doesn't mean you can't appreciate other parts of them, and support them when they show initiative.
---
Yea you missed out on volatile but unbound should be the same for the leather shipments.

[This guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88FpvjzeT_0) explores various things and makes a great video showing how its not just EA, its a "trend" among many tech industries, including gaming.

Note the video was made around 2 months ago. 
---
There are a few other videos of him investigating other lay offs and news in the tech and gaming world

Revenues means nothing without taking expenses into consideration.  You should really be looking at their net profit/loss.

Demon mask on sylvari is amazing! I’ve used that on my necro for so long that she looks weird without it. 
---
&gt; without them 
---
I have them :)
---
Thanks for the locations, ss it Veteran or Elite ? :)
---
&gt; This screams WvW and PvP.
---
And guilds. Let's not forget the absolutely ruinous state they're in.
---
If the future of PC gaming are games such as fortnite, then I have to consider switching to consoles...
---
She made up a lot of "facts" once she got fired from her previous company, this much was known even back when we found out she'd be working for ArenaNet
---
Ok, and yet this post... https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/atb65p/rumor_arenanet_has_been_pouring_resources_from/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
Besides, there are many ways you could have done this.  Simply deleting the name entirely and not even leaving a note is poor practice.  I doubt the bot would have deleted &lt;JP&gt; .
---
Better now than when it's too late to improve it in any way whatsoever.
---
"we" lol
---
Dont think. Just go play them if you want.
---
We still don't know what effect this fully has on GW2. I have been speculative of GW2s future ever since they said we were moving into season 5 instead of an expansion, since that means a lack of revenue. But we still don't know jack shit.
---
Game will still be here. I mean it will die one day because it relies on a central server and the industry standard for "always online" games is to just kill the servers once they become too costly.
---
Instead of talking about that myself I urge people to watch Ross Scott (it's the guy who made freemans mind, if the voice sounds familiar to you). He is leading an initiative to hopefully make killing games illegal, after all it's a product you paid for and expected to be able to use it.
---

[Second video, where his real intiative started](https://youtu.be/T2pdvh4uiaM?t=876)
---
I suggest giving them a watch if you're passionate about gaming. This trend is becoming way more "normal" than it should. He doesn't even want always online games to not neccesarily exist. He just wants them to be patched to work offline if they eventually do shut down the servers.
---
id rather it takes a while and comes out, the problem is that if you take too long then by the time it releases there will be almost no one left to play it. given recent news i will be surprised if it comes out at all
---
Anthem is getting pretty shitty reviews so I'll pass.
---
yeah well. you can't blame the people for being worried. I am. but i do agree there are way too many doomsayers in the comments, makes it look worse than it actually might be.
---
I feel like Guild Wars hasn't been the main focus of the studio for a while now. Things might not have to change that much for gw2 at least. I've looked at that 400 employees up many times in the past and wondered what all thise people were working on because it certainly wasn't content for the game. And no that's not a jab at them.
---
Shame we might never know now.
---
i don't get your logic, do you know how many projects get started and canceled in big companies?
---
why should the other projects be bad and never been started just because it isn't GW?
---
If story is what you like, there's dozens of AAA single player games out there, which do their job far better than GW2 does.
---
R. I. P
---
Unpopular opinion but I think diablo immortal will do well just because of the blizzard logo regardless of its quality, just that blizzcon was not the proper time to reveal it which got it memed to hell and back.
---
Does the 350 include maintenance of their games like dota and csgo or even artifact?
---
As far as I know it can be even normal mob, they all scale with amount of people nearby. It's irrelevant since it does no damage to you, it's just fast, immune to cc and moves constantly so you need to have semi decent build to kill it alone.
---
Yeah but I don't think the issue is with the quality of MMOs but that the demand for MMOs is dying.     The newer generation is likely more interested in instant gratification mobile games while MMOs that require long term commitment will scare them. While the audience that has loved MMOs till now has little time to commit to them anymore since they've grown. 
---
Of course no MMO release will compare to WOW because it released an such an impeccable time with the right technology.  Personally, I think the next MMO boom we'll see is when VR becomes an accessible platform middle class and 3rd world countries but that's out of topic.
---
I realize it will contribute to it, but they are merging with NCSoft; I'm not fooling myself, and I'm not going to invest in something that looks so close to death. Blame NCSoft for how it has handled other MMO's that decreased in popularity - they want to kill them in the hope that some of them shift to their other brands. They are only a few steps above Trion in my book.
---
Compare this with, say, how the developes of [Spiral Knights](https://www.reddit.com/r/spiral_knights/) went out of their way to make sure fans of the game would still have a game to go back to.
---
We had an event like that on Piken Square in the first year of the game. Matchup that we decided to not try to win, so we had a brainstorming about stupid stuff to do all week. Someone proposed to break every single wall/gate of Bay and leave it like that for as long as possible without taking it. The challenge was accepted and met. If I remember correctly, it was the guys from \[BOON\] that mostly did the job.
---
as if the alternative would be better lmao. 
---
Basically maintenance mode with the mini-expansions called Living Story "seasons" tacked on plus the usual gem store weekly new shinies.
---
&gt; Clearly too much for the development time that was spent on mobile applications that went absolutely nowhere.
---
Clearly right? So, where is your proof?
---
I think there should be a distinction between being apprehensive about the news and claiming the game is dying. We don't know enough to say anything about the state of gw2 post LS5, and while that is worrying it also doesn't necessarily point to the end of the game.
---
I guess I am also bit tired of the prevailing negativity in the subreddit. Some are indeed justifiable, but I already have enough to worry about during the day. I'd rather have enjoyable discussions about gw2 here.
---
Thing is, who plays mobile games? Like everyone from my generation ('90s kids) I know doesn't, they all play pc games.
---
 fallacy of sunkern cost springs to mind
---
who the hell thinks the game is shutting down?
---
No one knows. There was hints about having different Frameworks due that the base game was coded by devs that arent on board anymore and they seemingly adapted a newer one while jumping to HoT. AnetBen said this is why legacy things like Dungeons are so hard to fix and are probably better off getting rewritten.
---
Additionally they are riding on a graphics engine set on top on upgraded version of the GW1 engine. 
---
"We welcomed 10 millions migrants last year."
---
See the point ? Hyperbole leads to false interpretations, conclusions, and actions. It means you have to inflate the fact, to push a specific idea/agenda. It's manipulative and lying.
---
True. I was always in favor of a second Arena Net IP just because it brings a bit of security not only depending on one product. And of course, the revenue of GW would go partially to the new Game that is in development. This is just how things are.
---
This said... I would not expect that a developer just pretends to keep one game alive, while almost exclusively working on the other. Even if I don't take JP's comments into consideration, something seemed strange for a long time now. For example: The gap of almost 1 year between 2 raid wing releases. LW episodes having a fixed layout that didn't change since LW3. Even the scope of each episode stays roughly the same. Constant reshuffling of developers and teams. I mean... We heard this at least 3 times now since HoT release.
---
I am starting to wonder, if the release cycle is set to 3 months not because they can't do it faster/better. It sounds more like the 3 living world teams are working on their absolute limit to keep the standards up for each episode. (Yes I know... Each episode is at least 9 months in development. What would be even more worrying thinking about how little gameplay you get out of this work.)  So it was actually clear for me since this LW structure was announced, that a lot of dev resources are allocated to something different. We knew during LW3, that a new expansion is in the works. Thats why I assumed most devs worked on PoF. But now after the announcement that LW5 will start after 4 and we have no idea if there is an expansion after that, it started to smell fishy around the GW2 development.
---
Now that we know that not everyone at Arena Net was working on GW2 content, I get really concerned about the future after LW5. I assumed, that they just want to buy more time for the expansion development. But this was not the case as it seems. And if one of the unannounced projects is in fact the next expansion, then NOW is the time to say something about it. If Arena Net just keeps quiet now and stick to their "LW4 to LW5 and we will see where we going from there" statement, I (as a player) need to assume that GW2 will end after the next living world season. And with that, I really only log in to see how the story ends without spending any more money at the store. And I think many other people will do the same.
---
 **Friday, February 22**  
---
Noon Pacific Time (UTC-8) 
---
I *just* started playing this game two weeks ago and was going to drop $50 that I've saved up since then for the expacs—but now I think I'll stay on F2P until we get more concrete information on the future. I'd rather not drop a lot of money on something if it's just going to die in a month. 
---
This sucks, because I like this game a lot more than any other MMO I've played...
---
Raiders against easy mode are the same people who complain we don't get enough raids.
---
Self-awareness is a precious resource this day and age.
---
They will tell you anything they can to keep you playing. You have no idea what plug was really pulled. Anet is in full swing dmg control to limit the speculation.
---
We don't, but we know their rough headcount (~400) and as a software company something would have to be really massively wrong if total cost of employees aren't the vast majority of expenditures.
---
~80B SKW is about $175k in revenue per employee, which, while we can't see the books, would be well above the cost of capital unless something is really wildly wrong.
---
All that money is coming from GW2, and no more than half that headcount is supporting GW2 - there is no way you kill a $350k+ in annual revenue per employee game.  Even the most ruthless LBO keeps that intact.
---
Yeah, I feel you. I just wanted to say that the lack of repeatability directly translates into busywork.
---
Exploration is hard to make repeatable. I'd say that it may be easier to make procedurally generated stuff than to craft maps that feel endlessly explorable. Or at least extremely long lived. The HoT maps succeed magnificently in this respect. I've traversed their breadth, but I'm still finding new things.
---
I think most of the problems with exploration or idling would be mitigated if the game felt more "comfy." That is to say, it was just pleasant to sit in and do nothing. The only game I have ever felt that way towards was WoW, however. Something about the art style, the color palette, and the music all come together to make an extremely relaxing atmosphere that still manages to feel bustling.
---
I haven't gotten that feeling from Guild Wars. Don't really know why.
---
there was no additions to guilds since HoT really. With PoF we got another Guild Hall and the "usual" decorations from festivals but there was not really any change to how guilds interact or are viewed in the game.
---
All personal stories and living world seasons between them continue the story of your character (along with many other npcs and events that happen in the world, not just around you).
---
Starting a new season, or a new expansion story wont make the npcs you interact with forget what you did in the past, and what the world went trough before that story step.
---
If you wish to fully immerse your self in the story then you should totally do all story steps in chronological order, including the 2012 zhaitan storyline, and even watch the 3h long LWS 1 movie on youtube (since you cant replay season 1 anymore).
---
Gameplay wise you can totally pull it off in any order you wish really. Each season or personal expansion storyline has a  "beginning" and an "end" to its plot. 
---
The "beginning" being the continuation of the previous chapter, and the "ending" being the conclusion-&gt; with a cliff hanger.
---
People hating but the real answer is nothing. Mobile games as a medium are fine. They are however different to console/PC gaming. You can do both, either, spend money at Vegas or go sub to Netflix. In this day and age it's no longer about gaming but about entertainment in general when you consider the mainstream audience. 
---
That said, people who are avid fans of more serious gaming are worried they are being pushed into a niche. Which is pointless, they are already part of a niche community. 
---
Stopping to play the game won't "save" it either so your Statement is nonsence, NCSoft are assholes, but they wouldn't be so stupid to kill off a game that stilll generates Revenue and is kinda succesfull compared to CoH/CoV and Wildstar that were absolute desaters from the start!
---
Well, I find that disappointing because at the exit of HoT we have a hype of whew but for nothing in the end
---
Raids are harder than fractals but fractals need agony resistance which requires ascended gear. Raids don't have stat or gear requirements.
---
The difference between ascended and exotic is around %15 dps wise while other stats can make a larger difference such as Expertise , concentration etc. If you are playing a power dps full exotic armor and weapons with ascended trinkets ( very easy to make, just do a little research) you will be ready for most end game content as you only have about 8-10% difference than the highest possible stat.
---
Its business. I am customer and its not my role to work for their game. Its their role. If they fail I will find another game. This his how it works. They're not charity organization
---
There was a [statement on the official forums](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/69249/update-from-arenanet) saying that nothing will change. There are other posts from press releases and statements regarding the layoffs saying that it will not effect 'Guild Wars 2.'
---
Oh, nice. That pretty much gives GW2 a decade of active development -- honestly if it ends there that's a pretty respectable time for an MMORPG.
---
&gt;I get you’re being optimistic
---
he's not being optimistic, he's not making a fuzz over things he doesn't know yet.
---
They haven't given a damn about guilds since pretty much release.
---
The only decent update we got, guild halls, was exploited as a gold sink instead of something actually useful.
---
People say this... but gaming in general is actually moving towards everything being an MMO with multiplayer in every game and social interactions playing major roles in even mobile gaming.
---
We are losing out on certain aspects of gaming though. It sometimes feels like gaming is going from getting the entire movie/book (PC and console) to getting a summary or trailer (mobile).
---
Mobile money milking games are definitely a problem due to being an unregulated form of gambling, utilizing scam level tactics, pyramid scheme like practices, etc. They can even extort users in some cases. Many of the practices in mobile games wouldn't be even legal if done in traditional analog form instead of the digital form they take on.
---
Nothing will be done about it anytime soon though, particularly due to lobbying and policy makers lack of understanding just how valuable and real of an asset virtual goods can be.
---
It's not like many of these games and companies can't turn a profit, but that they have to continue to increase how much of a profit they make (why have a user pay for something once, when you can get them to pay for the same product multiple times over).
---
Why would they quote the former employe that was laid off because of toxicity and bad community service?
---
Stop quoting JP ffs
---
They would pray nobody would discover that ever, then.
---
this is as stupid as it gets.
---
*Former Guild Wars 2 writer (who was controversially let go last year following a Twitter exchange)*
---
Anyone who knows about JP's story will immediatly know that this sentence is referencing her. If my intention was to have the article look more trustworthy by hiding her name, I would have removed the description entirely as well, don't you think?
---
dont have your hope up unless the government in most countries shuts down publishers  who exploit the human addictive tendencies its only getting worse.
---
Upright publishers like the witchers devs are dying out.
---
Capitalism is the reason this game even exists lol
---
Yeah, i'm going to need a source for the "there will be an expansion which they already said in the past they were working on".
---
Sounds like you're pulling shit outta your ass as damage-control. 
---
I am not spending my money to prevent layoffs, I am spending my money to prevent the game server from being shut down like Wildstar or City of Heroes when their laysoffs hit
---
it's not like game dev is less profitable today than it was five years ago and gamers suddenly moved over to mobile. it's rather that mobile has higher profit margins because even your mom, your aunt, your little sister who can't speak yet, your grandma who's blind, and your pet squirrel is willing to blow money on mobile 'games'.
---
yeah don't know why people still flipping out about it..
---
can you jump ship while not being an asshole?
---
Send them home , they are obsolete
---
I stronly agree with you. I don't get why people keep making drama and demanding answers from a company who doesn't owe you anything. MMO-people are certainly one of a kind. I really like this game and honestly I highly doubt this is the beginning of the end or anything like that. Just a rough time for any company around. 
---
We'll know more about Coalescence with next LS release, I suspect next raid wing whenever that happens will be the last step for it.
---
&gt;possible new extension
---
did you mean expansion?, we don't have any news on that, we only know that LS5 is coming regardless of what happened recently.
---
Are you saying they don't know what they are working on? Lmao I sure hope not
---
Give me a shout if you're looking for people to play with, I usually just grind events etc on my own and would be happy to help out and answer any questions I can. Darkenager.1308
---
I believe ANet that they plan to soldier on after this. 
---
However, NCSoft are the ones with the ultimate say; Anyone remember what they did to CoH? With those jerks in charge, I can’t be confident they won’t just shut the game down with no warning. 
---
They gave us shit too many times, I have no longer hopes they can do anything meaningful and worth for me to be back. For me the game is dead, unistalled for now. I'll be back if a new xpac will be released, otherwise the game can die with all that dumb gem store rubbish and a mediocre map with an uninteresting part of a story no one cares about every 4 months. They put no effort into keeping their own game alive, why should I 
---
they pretty much reskin the game every other year and there never were this many super popular fps... and they still whine about having sold "only" 7.3 million copies of BFV. poor ea. hope they dont starve
---
i just blew $80 on gemstore in the beginning of february. feels like such a massive waste now.
---
Doesn't sound like they bothered building a strong IDE in the first place.
---
Not buying gems anymore.
---
Will play this until the game dies without sopending a single euro extra.
---
you mean the doom and gloom people who think they will lay off 350 out of 400 anet employees ?
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/69249/update-from-arenanet
---
They did release a statement about this a while a go. Nothing noticeable will change when it comes to content release. We are getting season 5 on schedule
---
They currently don't produce enough content to warrant a sub fee. It's 7 years on so I doubt much will change. 
---
That unannounced project might of been expansion 3 for all we know...
---
Saved them from the disaster that was battlefield V.
---
Also Fifa. People think we have whales on this game. I know two people at work that have spent £4K and £6k on Fifa. That’s not even unusual.
---
most of the "regular" people who have much more money like the "gamers" generally, which also have much less demands on a game and are even easier to exploit upon their human addictive tendencies to milk every penny while often they only have an empty shell of an game...
---
Yeah, and for that all of gw2 thanks you. As much as I think it's right to spend less to send the message you don't like the direction. Right now it's about spending more to convince the stakeholders that gw3 is more profitable as a pc game than a mobile game. This becomes a matter of which situation do you like less.
---
So my question is why do you think the company owes you answers? They put up a free to play game for you to play, with some nice additions overtime. They released some expansions pay-to-play which only gives you the right to play that story. I'm also a "costumer" because I bought expansions and some gem stuff but honestly, my money only gives me rights to buy stuff in-game or get some kind of support if something wrong happens. Why people think that paying a few bucks already entitle them to get answers from a company like if they owe us anything. They don't.  
---
NCsoft being NCsoft lmao, still sad tho.
---
Well sadly many people (myself included) decided the game wasn't worth their time anymore far before this announcement. All it did was confirm what most people were already feeling. (Poor release schedule, no repeatable contact, raiders quitting in droves, no expansion coming, bad communication)
---
Well indeed they had jobs listed till ncsoft said otherwise. 
---
so if i read that right: ANet moved staff away from GW2 for new projects, new projects will now get cancelled and staffing is lost - net result is either way ANet invests less in GW2 now. so that means only higher priority item gets done? so quality items like build templates are even less likely now... or what am i getting wrong?
---
sorry... i find this all super worrying. even if they keep getting LS5 out, just LS5 episodes won't be sufficient... or I am overreacting.
---
City. Of. Heroes.
---
o7
---
Never forget.
---
They really lucked out on that something which they didn't deserved at all (they had nothing do do with apex, which was the reason for the susses ofcs also) otherwise they would have ended their financial year on a nosedive and not even anthem would have saved it (which has many problems).
---
Realy unfortunately that they made EA strong again otherwise we might have not see them ruining every PC franchise (starwars) and gaming studio anymore...
---
Thankyou! will do 
---
A friend of mine had alpha access and said the game is amazing and he is one of the hardest persons to please in an MMO. 
---
I remember back on 2012 when I discovered gw2 on youtube  I was really happy that Anet make the decision do not make any sort subscription. One of my friend at that time (he was still playing wow) said clearly that a MMOrpg can't go anywhere without sub because server aren't free and a developer need money to make more content, man...he was so right, look where we are now.
---
Back to the question, I will pay for a sub right now?...No, because I don't know what could possibily change from now on, I mean Anet doesn't comunicate with us, the game seem pretty much on maintenance mode and it's just sad. 
---
Because the devs already own the means of development you dolt. The developers are the ones that provide the intellect + niche skills. Shareholders just provide the capital. Capitalism is about efficiently allocating resources. Without shareholders to provide capital this game wouldn't even exist in the first place. You can trash capitalism all day but at least get a clue as to what you're talking about first
---
I ran that build last night and it felt good tbh but take it with a grain of salt from me as i have not finished my placement yet. Definitely more suited for 1v1 had no issue vs mirages or warriors just have to time your dodges well.
---
and they get away with it because the government in most countries are still blind to this gambling which baffles me considering they bring this abusive addicive methos to underaged kids and no one cares...
---
I include my own - it is an inevitable consequence of multiple styles over the years :)
---
I didn't read her comment, because she is not trustworthy (for me) on this topic. 
---
&gt;those devs were GW2 devs that have been silently moved to other projects and now are being let go.
---
But then isn't it "good" from a GW2 point of view? Cancelled projects, no more devs that move away from GW2, less expenditure. (It feels wrong to call it "good")
---
&gt;and all the gem purchases have been going to funding these other projects. 
---
I think that's pretty normal for a company. I mean where should the money for other project else come from. They need to use their revenue ofcourse.
---
don't have your hops up apes saved their asses
---
People like you should be banned from this subreddit
---
So NCSoft saw Blizzard's industry leading profits reported shortly after their mass layoffs and decided to do the same?
---
It sucks because mobile games are soulless, crappy and last for a few weeks at best.
---
People will get bored soon and the amount of mobile games is increasing so fast that it won't be able to sustain itself. Then devs will have to return to real games in PC and consoles. It will take a couple of years but will be there. It already started the downhill. 
---
Don't know why people are downvoting. Tempest Auramancer was pretty strong as a support with D/F and was my go to pre PoF. But right now Ele needs love they have been nerfed in every game mode to the point where a very hard class to learn and even harder to master is not rewarding as other classes like firebrand or scourge where you spam on cooldown.
---
&gt; (whose name we shall not mention lol)
---
At this point I didn't know who you mean. 
---
&gt;(If you believe her of course)
---
Here I found out, because you wrote "her". lol
---
arenanet is retarded and untrusted brand. Roadmap? Schedules? Ha ha. 
---
The big thing that players dont realise is that in a company view why would you spend money in a game like gw2 that gives a moderate/low income if you could spend half of that money in a mobile thing that will give you 10x the revenue that the pc game gives?
---
Thats the sad reality of the world the game cant only have good earnings it most have that and a grow after years not a decay otherwise that product doesnt worth the investement and really the optimal course of action is to change the investments from that product to another one that will be more profitable in a long run.
---
I love Gw2 the game it is in my opinion the best MMORPG out there, but sadly for ncsoft is pretty much a money sunk, break even isnt enough for games anymore, you must have huge profits and grow over time or you are dommed, sadly thats how things are in captalism. im not saying that the game will die but if we dont have some big changes in the monatization system that the game have, a lot of the resources that go into gw2 will be redirect into more profitable projects...
---
&gt; for doing literally nothing
---
They are holding the shares, if not those folks you would be still playing with a stick in a sand.
---
As someone who sank 6k hours into GW1 and played it out of the gate, I could not disagree more. GW1 was continually flourishing in literally every single part of the game, from PvE to PvP strongly for years. 
---
I saw the writing on the wall on GW2 two years in that this was not the same ArenaNet with the same values. 
---
r/outoftheloop ?
---
Live your life!

I know exactly what it means and I'm correct. Get salty all you want but the truth hurts
---
This shot looks like the Choya near the Vabbian theatre heart in Domain of Vabbi. 
---
Someone is sexist here, but it's not her. Your post history is sludge.
---
If I remember correctly it's in Domain of Vabbi slightly west of the Seborhin Waypoint.
---
Some divisions of Anet are also merging with NCsoft, according to the rumors. This is not good news.
---
It's a crash when record profits aren't enough for the investors, who want more, more, and more.
---
You literally just said that the developers own the means of production because they provide the skill. That's not how you own the means of production. They ARE the means of production, but are owned by the company. 
---
Literally fucking googling "own the means of production" would have told you this.
---
&gt;The German economist Karl Marx argued that social stratification results directly from the relationship individuals have with the means of production. If you own the means of production, such as a factory, you are a member of the ruling, capitalist, wealthy class, also known as the bourgeoisie.
---
Some only want to hear what they want to hear - the human condition
---
This sort of thing is where I would be concerned, though I don't think the sky is actually falling, yet.
---
Yet.
---
Investors pricing in 8 million worth of sales are going to be disappointed seeing 7.3 million after all. They chase returns and when they see that their goals won't be realized the price will adjust to the level reflective of the actual situation. The role of the market after all is for gaining equity finance. Otherwise a poor share price can be ignored. 
---
Explains the balance patches.
---
Talk to the heart NPC, get a quest item just from talking to them, give that guy the quest item, save the very valuable 10s
---
I can say that arenanet has outwardly expressed interest in Mobile and a diversified game portfolio for many years. 
---
I believe one of the cancelled products would have been a Mobile game that explored early human occupation of Tyria, picking up as Dwayne emerged from the Mists or then about. 
---
I have to wonder how far they'll bring GW2. I wouldn't be surprised if they release one more xpack before focusing on what comes next. 
---
What will come next? GW3? Mobile port of GW? 
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/69249/update-from-arenanet#latest
---
"We will be moving directly from Living World Season 4 into Season 5 as promised" 
---
No more expansions... Confirmed?
---
So basically an update every few months till the game dies I guess. 
---
They barely have any combat and you can easily carry them with at least one higher level player.
---
Hahahaha you don't have a clueee dude just stop here. Here's the first paragraph from the Wikipedia article titled "means of production"
---
* In economics and sociology, the means of production (also called capital goods)[1] are physical and non-financial inputs used in the production of economic value. These include raw materials, facilities, machinery and tools used in the production of goods and services.[2][3] In the terminology of classical economics, the means of production are the "factors of production" minus financial and human capital.*
---
Notice how it says "non-financial" (so excluding the actual capital you need to produce products) and "minus financial and human capital". You look like such a clown right now means of production has never implied human capital dumbo
---
I would not be surprised. Look at Lineage 2 revolution, it actually plays well on phones (if you can tolerate small screens).
---
Id rather have MMO's on PC, but if they have to kick out a mobile game to make money for more GW2 expacs etc I would be fine with that.
---
Genetics 101. Love it.
---
Also way slower than istan
---
I'd hold tight. GW2 is one of their games that is MAKING money, so sticking around may lead to better things down the road.
---
The devs (as in, the actual people working on the game day-to-day) owning the means of development would mean that they'd own the computers, the servers, the office, etc. Surely you don't believe that they own all these things?
---
"Reeeeee, stop hurting my beloved game's feelings by saying the truth :("
---
fuck off, shill
---
I seem to recall they didn't mention an expansion at all. Just said "after LS4, we move straight into LS5." The distinct lack of saying "there will be another expansion after that" is what is causing a lot of people to call for ANet to give us a roadmap for their future plans. Because right now we just don't know.
---
If you have evidence on the contrary, I'd be very interested to see it.
---
They may not have an expansion planned for right now, but they have said that before now and then come out with one. I'd wait.
---
infact gw2 devs seems to be paid rather low 
---
I assume not. Lay's as for "those that are laid off", and filled with salt.
---
I can agree it's far-fetched.
---
This is what I hate about the gaming community as a whole. "Is X game dying?" leads to people being hesitant to play or continue playing, which inevitably leads to drops in population anyway. 
---
I personally expect regular expansions, so saying there won't be one is "cancelled" as far as I'm concerned. If Anet is stupid enough to think their b2p game can survive without expacs, then that isn't the consumer's "misunderstanding".
---
Both got  canceled.
---
It's just that you told us to take this abuse and not talk back. I understand the need of moderation, but man this feels bad.
---
Seems accurate.
---
The rumors are that devs were being transferred off GW2 onto other projects. Those projects are now cancelled and those devs are being laid off. GW2 doesn't seem to have any long term plans and now the company's long term plans are gone.
---
Nice try NCSoft.
---
I don't think that first point holds water at all; professions as a whole have only gotten faster and more mobile while all of the maps, desert borderlands aside, are the same size they were at launch. Large travel times might only be an issue in desert borderlands where it's often hard to find anyone to fight but that's compounded by the fact many people dislike the map.
---
That's exactly how I've been reading these tea leaves, and also seems to jive with Jessica Price's comments on Twitter.
---
She, of all people, would have little motivation or incentive to sugar coat this recent news, and even her reaction is one that's fairly neutral, basically acknowledging that it's not great news, but that the majority of the cuts are in areas that were already seeing a squeeze.
---
Yeah, she had to be spiteful and throw in that last paragraph. So classy.
---
My spirit animal 
---
&gt; I was talking about 'Living World Season 5' being later this year/early next year.
---
That's what I talked about too. Early next year would mean minimum 6 month no content. 
---
RIP GW3 and GW mobile
---
useless != less useful
---
druid is categorically less useful than other classes at anything its trying to be in wvw zvz; the only real benefit is the range on barrage for taking out certain seige spots... and reverting to moving spirits wouldnt fix that because other classes provide that support but better/with less cost
---
that said; play whatever you want in wvw and just because a class is less useful than another class; doesnt mean its completely useless
---
Being made by Blizzard and having a community means nothing if the game isn't that great.
---
Aaaaand here we go again :^)
---
Frankly, the game needs some way to retain themselves an OP of this thread more or less highlighted some things as to why this game doesn't have longevity, even if some of the points I disagree with.
---
It's a valid criticism -- which makes Evolushan's response all the more ridiculous.
---
You forget raid wings and holidays.
---
That's an old and ineffective retort, Venezuela is what happens when ppl elect a populist into power, a thin-skinned populist uneducated in the ways of the world.
---
The twilight books weren't great. I mean companies can shovel shitty products fam. 
---
how the fuck are you gonna play with gw2's combat on mobile?
---
Nah, game should've never gone F2P tbh
---
You know I *could* adress your points and try to have an actual (pointless) argument, or I could [link](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/apnvln/anet_gms_in_reddit/egbr0x0/) to your hillarious idea that ArenaNet is vote manipulating reddit comments by employing "social media experts" that "scroll through social media sites".
---
I think I'm gonna do the second one, maybe the people reading this thread could need the laugh today.
---
What a childish reply. “I’m correct, u mad”. 
---
i like WP with his rational look at things, it's a good Video at least not complete hysteria like so many posts here recently :)
---
But less peak performance procs with a higher number means he is more bursty. He gets more damage in his one peak performance proc and less in the off time, but you could consider the off time to be less important due to phasing
---
So every dev now goes working on GW2 franchise, good news. More centralized, more effective, let's hope - better content. 
---
The sun will come out tomorrow, but we have a giant blank space for next year. As a player, the promise of the plan still being that LS5 and Alliances will come sounds a bit hollow given how sudden the recent news made an impact on their day to day. All we know is that is the *plan*.
---
Anet's plans can and will be changed, just as they are now having to make very sudden adjustments. Blind optism and hope is fine, too. Just enjoy the ride while you can because either way the future of Anet is completely out of our hands.
---
TBH later statements, if they are true, read more like Anet streched itself too thin with side projects which didn't seem to have a release in the close future thus no income. This also resulted in less development for GW2 and maybe "no expansion but instead expansion like content with LS5" is the result of this. Expansions have been great income-spikes for NCSoft so this might be their way of saying focus on the money maker OR it can also very well be the same NCSoft that sent CoH down the drain but we will see how this plays out I guess.
---
Your criticism and blame isn't valid, no matter how many times you post it.  
---
Fortnite and Apex Legends will never be games that play in a way I'll enjoy.  Therefore I don't play them.   
---
Taking personal responsibility for your own entertainment is a good choice.  Endlessly attacking a game to force it to become what you want is foolish.
---
&gt; The fuckwad is just replaced by a corrupt government
---
Socialism (and communism) is when workers control the means of production, governments are not required by that at all (although they can be used as a means of it). I suggest you learn a little more about socialism before offering commentary on it. Even if it were government though, governments can at least be voted on, and members of socialist governments are not (at least supposed to be) personally enriched by your work. The *entire point* of socialism is to prevent singular rich fuckwads extracting wealth from the workers and hoarding it. So even in socialist systems that involve a government
---
&gt; see pet eating Venezuela. 
---
You mean Venezuela where they have higher private ownership than in France? You think that is an example of government controlling all the business? You think the Bolivarian governments problem is too many people getting rich in it off the backs of workers?
---
I get that there is a LOT of bad information about Venezuela out there and it tends to be more prominent in general, and this is not a defense of Maduro, but you really need to know a little bit more about a topic like that if you're going to use it like this.
---
Venezuela was a country with massive poverty for decades. The Bolivarian government managed to eradicate illiteracy in their country which the US still struggles with, massively increased the amount of education their children were receiving, increased their average life expectancy by 2 years, halved infant mortality, almost halved the poverty rate and more than halved extreme poverty, 40% reduction in child malnutrition, with overall malnutrition going from 21% to less than 3%, and unemployment dropped from ~15% to ~6%.
---
The point is, this government had historic gains, but the combination of changing leaders from the extremely capable Chavez to the... less capable Maduro, plus being a petrostate that was hit extremely hard by the intentional flooding of the oil market, and the pressure from US-lead sanctions and general economic warfare has done a huge number on that state. Trying to say "its bad because socialism" is just simplistic and wrong.
---
&gt; Yes some people do derive satisfaction from their jobs but the VAST majority of roles have profit as at least somewhat of a motive. The only ones I can even think of off the top of my head would be raising kids, taking care of the elderly, and volunteering which hardly qualifies as a lot. 
---
They don't have to be the majority of jobs to prove the point that people are quite willing to work without a profit motive (and again "no profit motive" isn't really an accurate description of the systems in question here. Co-ops for example can provide the basis for a type of socialism, and we already see co-ops existing and people still make money in them. They just get to keep the full value of what they make and have a say in how their workplace is run).
---
&gt; I don't know a lot of waste water, coal miners, plumbers, garbage truck drivers, or assembly line workers that would still go to work if they won the lottery.
---
I thought we were talking about some mix of UBI, socialism and communism, not winning the lottery.
---
Communism and socialism at their core can be looked at as bringing democracy to the economy and the workplace. I feel like maybe you should do a bit of reading on it since you seem somewhat interested in politics. You might still find that you disagree but at least you'd have a stronger understanding of what you disagree with (and maybe even how to argue against it).
---
WTF does Arenanet has to do with anything? It's NCSoft's decision to drop the projects Anet devs were working on, merge publishing and fire those working on the canceled projects. 
---
I dunno, im enjoying the game more than ever, but i might just be the odd one out
---
Well them projects have been canceled so it was all for nothing.
---
raid wings come with LS episodes. And holidays? It's a safe content break. Only because we know that there will come no content, this weeks don't disappear. It still would be half a year without content. 
---
&gt; 34, DD.
---
*laughs in 12yo* Well done.
---
&gt;We can confirm that due to the cancellation of unannounced projects, ArenaNet will make staff reductions," the statement reads. "This is part of a larger organizational restructuring within NCSOFT in the west, but the Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2 game services will not be affected, nor is any upcoming game content canceled.
---
The only thing this tells me is that the GW servers aren't coming down and that LW Season 5 is still planned. 
---
They also have a bit about live game revenue dropping, so I don't expect that this is a rush to put resources back into GW2. Imo they are preparing for the retirement home/maintenance phase of MMOs with a reduced budget and expectations.
---
Regardless, not exactly what they said. They're saying layoffs happening (not exactly to who) because of a variety of reasons including failed projects. Wait and see time
---
Lol how's the weather up on your moral high horse?
---
I'm sorry, but if the developers who work on the game know next to nothing about a roadmap for their plans in the coming year, then they're in huge dire straits.
---
Inventory Management Deluxe
---
Funnily enough I have the games i played the most in the 90ies still on my harddrive. Long live DOSBox!
---
Note that many people from GW2 team could have been moved to other projects and now they will be fired.
---
I donno about that, games as a service can do just fine by having a large casual player base that only checks back in every few months. It's easy to forget that some of the biggest spenders for MMOs don't usually clock in the most hours played and have a much more casual rate of consumption.
---
I think it's more of a question of how they manage to monetize in that time. The occasional gem store cosmetics don't really compare to a new expansion. LS episodes are free. I feel like the gameplay and story system are unique enough to not worry about losing out to competition (that and there's no subscription fee). People can still pick up again to play when they want and take a break without much consequence.
---
Interesting question. D&amp;T was an Alliance guild that held the spotlight in vanilla WoW when they began scoring many world first kills on bosses in Naxxramas, like Patchwerk and the Four Horsemen. They lost the first kill to the wing's final boss Kel'thuzad to Nihilum though and were seen as rivals for the next expansion the Burning Crusade.
---
They did fairly well early on but if you look at the world &amp; region first kills, D&amp;T began to fall behind. By the time the final raid was released, Sunwell Plateau, D&amp;T was no where to be seen. There was a long stretch of no 25-man raids between Black Temple &amp; Sunwell (over a year), and it's speculated that this content drought took a toll on their guild. 
---
They officially disbanded a few months after the race for Sunwell was over. You can see their guild disband post on the wowwiki still: https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Guild:Death_and_Taxes_(Blackrock_US)
---
I believe the active members of D&amp;T rerolled to Blackrock as horde and have continued to raid since. They've got quite a few members now, with branches in different games, like FFXIV and Guild Wars 2. When you see a D&amp;T player in any of those games though, it's unlikely they were around for their world first Four Horsemen kill though. That was 13 years ago after all!
---
While true, I think if she was going the "negative Nancy" route, she'd have chosen much more effective words.
---
Sounds to me like she's not happy about seeing friends lose their jobs, and her tweets come across, to me, as resigned, but neutral honesty, not hyperbolic doomsaying or glaring at all.
---
It's hard to build hype when your expansions are the direct result of the last living world season.  If they said we were heading to Elona then story-beats would be spoiled for several Living World stories in Season 3.  It's tough.
---
I had already done that when I was playing.
---
There is also an Anet Twitter source in there so.
---
They said that Gw1 and Gw2 wouldn't be affected by this.
---
while giving new CEO a fat 15 mio bonus as a welcome
---
you're wrong, sorry. but i admire your confidence 
---
Considering the numbers each of those games pulled in terms of players (except maybe h1z1, im not sure), you can say they were very successful, no matter what your personal opinion about them is.

Just a couple thoughts.
---
So GW - Battle Royale is still in development?
---
Lovely shot overall! Outfit looks cool af too, what's your fashion if I may?
---
Its worth remembering that ncsoft killed coh to refocus resources onto gw2. They arent likely to abandon their pet.
---
&gt; When was the last content added to gw1 ?.. how many people you think are working on it ?
---
Yes, and it's still running! 
---
This is all speculation and we will never really know the truth. But the fact and reality is ANET's history of slow and meager content delivery. Why? Again we will never know for sure. But here is my speculation:    
---
      
---
My theory is that original codebase was created by more capable coders from GW1 or they weren't capable and did a bad job. Soon after GW2 launched these people left the company. ANET hired cheaper coders with higher turnover who aren't familiar with the code or didn't stay at the company long enough to develop a good understanding. This could be due to varity of issues, and another speculation for another time (check ANET's glassdoor page to get an idea).    
---
    
---
Or the other theory is that ANET has been working on other projects for last 5 years or so. And for whatever reason they failed to come to fruition. To support this, in another thread yesterday there was a link posted to chinajoy article from 2013. In that MO talks about having 4 mobile teams working on some sort of mobile app. What happened to that project? Too many questions at this point and very few real answers.

Play below plat, they're in over half your matches. What's great is they're still better than many actual players because the class balance is so fucked

no

This does put some of my worries at ease. It still sucks for those employees that are losing their jobs, but the worst case scenario doesn't seem to be happening.
---
This is something not enough people in this community understand. "the game is dying" doesn't mean it's run over by a Truck and vanishes to be, it's a long and tedious journey and a constant battle against the inevitable.
---
Not one single thing kills this game. But they add up. But tell that to this community and they'll rip you a new asshole for daring to speak your concerns. 
---
To be fair, the entire video game industry was built from someone wanting money and people paying for the game.  This market wouldn't exist in other economic models.
---
I’d be willing to pay for gem store items, expansions, even content. Not a subscription though.
---
&gt; Good enjoy your dead game.
---
If we listened to people like you, then we would play a "dead game" since release, lol.
---
I am just customer. I pay and I want to have a fun. I am not here to work for them and play dead game :| I am not tester or someone. 
---
I was thinking the same thing the more I think on this situation.
---
The question we should be asking is are you willing to pay for living story content, because at this point I can’t imagine LS5 not coming with a fee. That will keep the game alive. 
---
Absolute nonesense. 
---
Stop with the shitpost...
---
Apologies, on my phone app searching for posts is sketchy at best.
---
I think quality is a lesser concern where mobile is surging, because of infrastructure. For instance, if you work in China, you may communte for hours to and from work, given the huge distances in that country. That means the easy alternative is mobile, you don't have time to game at home. And they are just so many potential customers, and that's just one example.
---
I completely agree btw, mobile is about the worst possible platform for games, when it comes to immersion, controls, and resources. But I don't think the games themselves are why it's peaking.
---
Depends of content. If everything stays the same, then I wont pay every month, thats for sure.
---
Give it up. They live in a pseudosocial relationship in which the company is their friend, made up of tiny little dev friends.
---
Bigger than Apple. Apples market cap is huge but profits are like 80 billion. 546 billion in a year would justify a 20 trillion market cap right now
---
If [these tweets are true](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/atb65p/rumor_arenanet_has_been_pouring_resources_from/), GW2 was already on maintenance mode.
---
I find it hard to believe GW2 will get any better when the company itself seems to have given up on it long ago.
---
&gt; I'm not saying it's panic time. These aren't Wildstar numbers — not even close. When you hear that NCSoft is merging Anet's publishing with their own, the first thing that should come to mind are the other games NCSoft has and how GW2 holds up to them. For the most part, Anet has been doing well by that measure.
---
The first thing should come to mind is that it's a cost saving measure (NCSoft will have their people do the job instead of paying for two groups of people) and that **NCSoft were the publishers of GW2 up until 2015, the sky didn't fall then, everything was fine for three years with NCSoft publishing GW2.** If NCSoft decide they no longer want to see money invested in new projects which ArenaNet was chasing, taking over the publishing is an obvious first step to cancel any projects in development and reduce the number of staff. It does not mean GW2 will see reduced resources, in fast it's possible GW2 will benefit from it. Cancelling all unreleased titles shifts ArenaNet's focus solely to GW2, as you mentioned expansions are the biggest money makers for GW2 (gliders and mounts, whatever expansion 3 brings) so that will likely be NCSoft's priority as the publisher now.
---
ArenaNet announced Path of Fire on the 1/08/2017, it released on the 22/09/2017 (only 53 days later). Up until then they were completely hush about the expansion (even if the entire thing was leaked) and many of us were immensely satisfied that the time between the official announcement and the expansion was so short.
---
Keep in mind, Heart of Thorns released in 23/10/2015 and Path of Fire released 22/09/2017, roughly two years later. They had a massive content drought between HoT's release and Season 3 (because no-one was working Season 3 until around the time HoT shipped) and they actually stopped development of PoF briefly (it began right after HoT landed) to do a quality pass on HoT which was finished early 2016.
---
After the quality pass of HoT they put the full PoF team back together and continued the Season 3 development. My point is, **PoF was in development almost immediately after HoT was released, with a small disruption to fix some issues with HoT, even with a full team working on it, it took two full years to complete an expansion, we are still well and truly on track to see another expansion drop within the two year window that PoF took to develop.** The reason we are getting two Living World Seasons before another expansion is likely because unlike Season 3 which took months to begin after HoT released, Season 4 began almost right away, allowing for a full extra season to fit within the development window of the next expansion.
---
Everything we know about PoF's development (took roughly two years, was only officially announced about two months before launch) still fits perfectly with the likelihood of expansion 3 being announced and released late this year after Season 5. ArenaNet learned their lesson with HoT - they waited too long after GW2 launched to begin work on GW2's expansion, that's why PoF's development began right away when HoT launched. It's illogical to think ArenaNet didn't do the exact same thing with expansion 3 once HoT released (the Living World teams worked on Seasons 4 and 5, the expansion team should be over a year into working on expansion 3). NCSoft isn't going to take over ArenaNet publishing, can all project except for GW2 and then scrap an expansion that should be more than 50% complete.
---
tldr: NCSoft published GW2 from 2012 to 2015, the game was fine then. It took two years from HoT's release for PoF to release and they began work on PoF right after HoT, it has not been two years since PoF released so we are still within the known window of expansion development time. People think two Living World seasons means no expansion, but it's more likely that the release cadence post PoF had no content drought like HoT did, which means there was time to do two seasons before expansion 3 was ready.
---
Stop being drama llamas.
---
A monthly subscription is actually the reason what keeps many casual players from buying a game. In my experience, GW2 is one of the most casual MMO's out there, hence a monthly subscription will scare casual players away from the game. 
---
So no, this wouldn't be a good idea imo. Personally, since I have been playing since head start and I really love the game, would be fine with paying a small fee.
---
Dread it, run from it... layoffs still arrive.
---
If you think running (and keeping it at the top level) a digital distribution business like Steam is easy, go ask Epic how their first attempts are going.
---
Literally two sentences in and you already proved you didn't bother to understand.
---
I much preferred the announcement and release within two months. I hated the long drawn out release of HoT. It helped that PoF was almost 100% leaked (every map, every mount, every elite spec revealed almost a year in advance) but the long drawn out reveals suck.
---
Specifically they are going to shaft all the things not making any money and "putting a drain on the company"
---
&gt;I would not be surprised. Look at Lineage 2 revolution, it actually plays well on phones (if you can tolerate small screens).
---
We must have different opinions of what plays well ;)
---
Subscription with the in-game economy and gem shop in the current state? Definitely not.   
---
If they overhaul the entire game, which is obviously not gonna happen, then..whatever? 
---
A clicker game where you open bags inside of bags.
---
*Wait a minute...*
---
That's not what i was replying to.
---
What i replied to was the guy saying that "it was confirmed they were already working on 3rd expansion". Which is a blatant lie. When i asked him for source, he didn't provide one and decided to edit his comment to remove it. Sad person
---
That's... just not true. The big motivator behind this recent layoff/profit dropping seems to be side projects being mismanaged/simply not getting released/not getting the money out of them that NCSoft wants. All the communication on these layoffs seems to stem around NCSoft being dissatisfied with other long term projects ArenaNet has failed to produce profit from -- and NCSoft isn't one to keep a game around, if CoH is anything to go off of. Granted, we don't know all the details, but given what we know the game has made in the past during big release periods, I don't think the answer is as simple as "ArenaNet's profits are falling/the layoffs happened because they don't listen to people".
---
That being said, sure: those are big issues they need to fix. I don't agree that casual PvE cannot retain players, but I do agree that PvP and WvW are in bad places and deserve attention, particularly in the meta, in how stale the gamemode has been (seriously, conquest is boring), and in an infusion of new content. I also agree that the way LW maps are going right now may not be the best for repeatable content, and that it wouldn't hurt for them to be open to communicating more.
---
GW2 "living" really means nothing when the content is barebones, the company does not bother to listen and we still have to wait 3-4 months for something we'll beat fully in two days.
---
They can’t see the future. If you put your money on a sinking ship, you shouldn’t keep putting it there to see if it might float later.  When they started the projects it may have looked like a good idea but it may be an obviously bad one years later
---
They pulled numbers because they were the best at the time. Out of all the BR games out Apex is the only one to actually launch in a super solid state. Fortnite too I guess but it wasn't built originally to be a BR.
---
What is dead may never die
---
No way. My wife and I have a number accounts between us, it would cost us a small fortune. 
---
&gt;Do people want/expect Anet to stay a one game company?
---
\*slowly points at Riot Games showering in money with LoL\*
---
Well, if they bothered to make a good game.
---
Linkazzatore a lot of people reiterate the same old guff over and over. Even when it's no longer the case.
---
The issues with the mount are;
---
1. it might imbalance the game if 50 people can wreck a gate too quickly without using WvW's unique core mechanic : supply.
---
2. it might cause issues if zergs can travel too quickly from one part of the map to another.
---
3. the combat oriented skills and hardiness of the mount are unknown at present, so their impact on fighting is also unknown.
---
Other than these, it's probably a good refreshing change.
---
While other concerns such as population balance/class balance are valid, they're not something easily controlled without nerfing gem store transfers or affecting other game modes respectively.
---
this kind of goes against some of the tweets from 2-3 employees I've been reading.
---
Damn you get it.  :)

The fact that you played Wildstar shows that you are clueless about MMOs in general , as it was never going to succeed. It was destined to fail before it was even released due to their design philosophy.
---
You're using literally incorrectly lol
---
she got laid off :(
---
uhhhhh, there was just an update for GW1 this month? back on Feb 8th that was pretty substantial
---
there was another one last year that updated a lot of the graphics and resolution options in game
---
I think their stubbornness about moving away from doing expansion packs will be their downfall, personally. Nobody outside the existing community knows or cares about living world updates. It's keeping new players away, as they see a lack of new expansions as no new worthwhile content being added. In fact, I'm almost inclined to agree. I honestly couldn't care less for half of the living world maps. Aiming to put out a new one every update means that the map quality suffers, and most of the time there's no reason to revisit them. On the other hand, I still go back to HoT maps just for the fun of it.
---
There are supposedly 2 GW1 devs still.
---
To me, this was new &gt;.&lt;
---
Meh, and i was waiting for a new addon.
---
But, whatever, LW5 will get the job done, for now, i guess.
---
I remember the community of another game company thinking the same as you OP, trying to convince themselves and everyone that everything is ok when it very clearly isn't, trying to pretend that a company gives a shit about us when all they really want.
---
But i don't think the Blizzard community thinks that way anymore by now. I suggest you actually begin to think about this, rather than suggest we should thank the devs because "they work hard to make us happy".
---
At the same time, a company's plans will probably drastically change in light of layoffs, perhaps because the staffing changes means they can't reach their original goals, or ~~the overlords~~ NCSoft will change the direction Anet will go in. It's probably too late to abandon LS S5, which is why Anet made the announcement that mentions continuing with S5 right after S4, but past that is up in the air and subject to change. Anet probably has has plenty of plans for the future after S5, but now nobody knows what they will be doing.
---
That exactly. Old info about blizzard was saying something like 4700 employees total number and is with devs across all blizz games community managers support etc etc. We can't compare games to company. Not all those 400 are devs posts.
---
its is very very unlikly that someone like anet would make a full blown mmorpg again ... all they are likely to do are mobile games or smaller games
---
I dont pay them to be possitive. As customer I expect playable, engaging content. While it looks like their team of 400 people do almost nothing if u compare it to World of Warcraft (~300 people) team... ArenaNet is lazy. 
---
Those updates are from a few devs who work on GW1 in their spare time.
---
Horizontal progression is fine.
---
The problem is that most of it comes straight from the gem store, which means our endgame (cosmetics) is technically pretty much P2W (Pay To Win).
---
Horizontal systems work when the aesthetics have value. You earn value by making them hard to acquire, either because you need to complete hard content or dedicate a lot of hours.
---
The few skins we can obtain by playing have no challenge behind them, thus making them worth nothing. The gem store skins are just gold farms, and they also get saturated easily, making them worth nothing too.
---
How many skins in the game feel valuable, and worth wearing for just what they represent? Have you seen any guy wearing a specific skin and thought "that guy is really lit"? Nah, you just think he has money, and that's it.
---
[The rewards of this game have been a mess since pretty much forever.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/2659oq/everything_that_is_wrong_with_gw2_rewards/)
---
This whole thing makes me want to buy some gemstore stuff I don't want
---
Probably some minigame featuring Dragon Watch.
---
Or Flappy Aurene.
---
That makes it ok.
---
Just the firing of over 900 people between the recent layoffs at Blizzard and the previous sudden layoffs from Heroes of the Storm's esports division was ok because they were from "non-sustainable projects".
---
yes, but those devs, if laid off, wouldn't be able to continue that work on gw1...so they are still the "gw1 team"
---
Good, those 2 don't need to exist. 
---
Neglecting guilds is by far the worse thing they ever did.
---
Communities are the backbone of any multiplayer experience, guild being the strongest pillar, yet they have showed zero effort and zero interest on keeping them strong and healthy.
---
Nah , I don't think it is. I tried opening a bunch of the unbound magic shipments and didn't net a profit at all. They simply are not the same as the volatile shipments.
---
Has nothing to do with corporate. If the game keeps going, everything is fine. If the game folds, everything is fine. Sure, it friggin sucks for the people that are losing their jobs, but those are the breaks.
---
'Guild Wars 2' is a game I play for entertainment. Nothing more, nothing less. And there are plenty of other games I can play for entertainment.
---
&gt;Note that Anet has way more employees than other MMO teams, even WoW
---
......what?
---
What causes recessions then?
---
If a company is failing then, should people be expected to not take a salary or pay up
---
It only took a few replies for her to start the usual sexism crap. The males impacted will fall upwards after this apparently according to her. She always has an agenda, even when telling something based in fact as her comments based off the teams hard work etc seem.
---
Actually character names are one of the things support always asks for. I had to recover my account after years away , and after dozens of emails back and forth , guessing a few of character names was what finally put it over the top for them to restore my account. 
---
My bad.
---
So basically, we suffered in GW2 so they could use that money to fund mobile and other bad games, while hurting GW2 content and putting the game into maintenance mode?  
---
WvW restructure is like 14 months and counting lol
---
As if anyone should care what she has to say
---
He also says he has his doubts the game will continue after season 5. 
---
That and looking at WoW these days it very much feels like Blizzard aren't giving it their all. Which makes me suspect they don't have as big of a team working on it as they did. And comparing an understaffed MMO to one which isn't isn't quite fair.
---
But, to be fair, I have no data to back this up.
---
It was cancelled. Instead they created the [GW2 API](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:Main) so third parties could make their own APPs, like GW2Timer and GW2Efficiency.
---
It's explicitly NOT dying. NCSoft is cutting unreleased games, as in New IP. Which sucks, because it would be great to see ANet add more games to it's roster, but this is about new projects taking too long to release. I hope they still have one or two non gw2 projects, but honestly I would hope this helps them focus on gw2 more. I think they've done amazing on the pve side and the pvp/wvw side is enjoyable at least to a casual player.
---
is 100 % not gw3 ... do you really expect anet would make a full blow mmorpg again, when mobile games do more than pc and console combined already and they still have an running mmorpg(why should they make competition witin their own company)?
---
It's not about class balance. Back when BG bots were widespread in WOW, they were better than your average WOW player at any class. 
---
All good. I just wanted to clear up a bit of misinformation. It was a good comment otherwise.
---
People do care just not the governments. They’re out of stuff and stuffed with old people.
---
This makes me question how such critical information got leaked in the first place. I have no doubt it must be another disgruntled employee who realizes he might lose his job. Doing this is such a HUGE blow to the name of the game, and with all these rumors, it will do nothing short of making everyone there more miserable than they already are.
---
When a game or any piece of software is in maintenance mode there is a skeleton crew working full time on it to keep the lights on and trickle out some easy to implement updates like balance changes or simple bug fixes.  This is done until the game bleeds enough players where it is no longer profitable and the servers are shut down.
---
GW2 was not in maintenance before and they likely won't be for at least a year.  If those tweets were actually true it just means the focus of ArenaNet shifted away from GW2 to other projects.  GW1 is in maintenance mode so if you want to know the difference just compare GW1 and GW2 releases/updates over the last year or so.
---
What maintanence mode? Stop being a spoiled brat you get a sizable free content patch for every 3-4 months. That's not maintenance mode by any means.
---
I intend it to be dismissive. This isn't a meaningful discussion, it's hysteria without facts.
---
ArenaNet have already confirmed: 
---
&gt;First and foremost, we are still fully committed to all of our players and ongoing support of the game. We will be moving directly from Living World Season 4 into Season 5 as promised, and we plan to continue a regular cadence of updates and releases.
---
&gt; We know Guild Wars 2 is important to you, and as our players, you are important to us. Rest assured that we are still working to add great new content to the game. We are deeply grateful to all of you for your support during this difficult time.
---
This is exactly what was happening last week, it's the same today. We know what their plans are for the game.
---
Demanding more information is entitled, hysterical bullshit. You what's completely innapropriate right now? Demanding ArenaNet announce an expansion they planned to announce later this year when their employees literally don't know who will have a job next week. How pathetically entitled do you have to be to demand they "communicate" more details than what was already known (Season 5 after Season, a regular cadence of releases and updates, great new content) while in the middle of layoffs. Expansion announcements (which is what Kyouji is really asking about, seeing as everything below that was covered in the official statement already released) are supposed to moments of joy and celebration. Demanding that in the middle of layoffs is disgusting.
---
The "quantifiable" info needed here is **any** proof the sky is falling as much as people are speculating.
---
&gt; Them staying quiet will do so much damage that the game will never recover.
---
Comments like this are alarmist bullshit and should be called out for the hysterical nonsense it is. They restated the release schedule as it was known is still the same, demanding an expansion reveal while people are being laid of is disgusting and even if it wasn't it's not good marketing. 
---
Get some actual facts about what's happening and why it actually means development of GW2 has fundamentally changed in a negative way and maybe people won't be dismissed. Layoffs are never good, yes ArenaNet looks less stable today than they did last week but they have already confirmed Season 5 will continue with regular cadence, if you'd followed the media reports, ArenaNet staff are yet to find out who is being let go, hysteria is only making this situation worse.

PC market is making less for everyone  at the minute, you can't use overall stats that include mobile profits etc when talking about the sustainability of a product owned by a company in multiple markets. Far Cry New Dawn is an example of this. Pc made its least profit of all, it was top of chart sales wise above metro but is a flop according to the company yet Metro is a huge success for the smaller non mobile phone market company. Big companies are seeing smaller profits in pcs and huge profits in mobiles and are moving resources accordingly. Posts like this help noone. 
---
Yes he does mention means of production. "Means of development" isn't a thing in its own right and it was quite clear from the context that the person was using it equivalently to "means of production", except we're talking software not iron mines so "production" doesn't fit well.
---
What exactly do you consider to be the definition of "means of development", and why did you not see fit to clarify that when responding to someone else using the term in a clearly different way?
---
I mean is there a dev team for gw2? There hasn't been any major updates for a while now.. 
---
That article doesn't contain any new information, it just summarizes the press releases and tweets from Jennifer Schuerle and Jessica Price. The reddit headline seems to be supposition from the poster, not anything from the article.
---
As others have pointed out, this is blatantly wrong/wrong comparison and it is downright deplorable that you got even a single upvote for promoting false information. 
---
&gt; Remember this was their "content focused" expansion that failed to produce as much gameplay value as HoT, which was even excused as their "feature based" expansion. The #1 complaint about PoF has been its lasting value, largely the result of lackluster rewards and event design.
---
I would argue PoF did have more content, it just wasn't designed to be farmable like HoT. PoF's Living World experience definitely will have more content (two seasons instead of one).
---
Its their decision and their problem. As we can see FF14 can manage people properly to make enough content for their game. While as we can see ArenaNet cant. They got ~400 people which: cant finish other games and cant work enough on gw2 content to do it regular and fast. 
---
I don't know, I really like the no expansion idea. Because ANet still makes money from New players buying back episodes, and they've done a fantastic job making every map desirable in some way. I'm a firm believer that expansions cause an unhealthy boom/bust cycle.
---
I just hope that this doesn't end up with NCSoft turning the screws to exploit the gem store in worse ways.
---
yeah I'm sure they will. What is this about a WvW mount? when I left people were saying WvW was dead but I remember still really enjoying it with ig mates.
---
"What this means is the hard working soldiers on the front lines get hit the hardest."   
---
This is why developers need to unionize. How is it fair that the people that put in long hours to create the product that generates the revenue in the first place get hit the hardest? What about the people that set the bar for financial goals so high?  
---
I'm going to sound like Jim Sterling here, but there seems to be a pattern where big game publishers make large or even record-high profits, but still have to make cuts because they "didn't reach there goals." To me, that sounds like an excuse to exploit workers in the first place: They'll set these beyond-reasonable goals ("all the money in the world"), act surprised that they didn't reach said goal, and then fire the primary work force while dividing the profits amongst executives and shareholders.
---
I wouldn't compare reducing projects with cheating. It's not like NCSoft was working on CoH behind GW2's back. NCSoft has had their fingers in too many pies, they're reducing the amount of pies. Hopefully GW2 will remain. But considering GW2 is a cash shop type of deal, especially without an expansion on the horizon, the only way to make that happen is to reassure the player base. I think most people right now are a little extra hesitant to pour money into the game.
---
And even when it's good in PvE, the staff build is so awful and boring IMO. Weaver is legitimately a fun class, it's just set back by *awful* animation desyncs from its damage and other quirks.
---
ArenaNet: Introduce a system, forget about it, pretend you know what you're doing, repeat.
---
Simple. Because right now everyone is focused on mobile crap, and no new MMOs are on the horizon. There's tons of players waiting for a new good MMO to dive into. This is probably one of the best times for a new MMO to come. 
---
Please stop defending her.  You look pathetic.
---
Right, instead NCsoft will kill gw2 team anyway and now u will have nothing to replace it. On top of that 100s of employees loosing their jobs cause having 1 7 years old game is not sustainable. But good I guess...
---
What, we got huge amount of decorations just like...two months ago?
---
You are only talking about valance, pvp n stuff while this game is like 95% pve...
---
I don't think that anyone outside of the people with ANet tags and outside of their company accounts will disclose that here.
---
Sounds like a great app that will most likely not exist😞
---
You do move while fighting. Movement is only restricted on some skills as an additional downside, similar as 100b in GW2. But stances, shouts etc. don't require you to stop.
---
I don't know if a 30 min story mission which requires 8 players is ok for mobile games.
---
You used "I'm correct" incorrectly multiple times.
---
&gt;Hardly. They were the go to support spec until PoF released and before HoT
---
Why the hell would this matter? That's more than 1.5+ years ago, should I and other Elementalists feel warm and fuzzy inside because of our legacy? No, the history of a class being good is not enough to keep players playing *now*. They've required some attention for a long time, but ANet ignores it.
---
&gt; Anet brought in revenue of ~80 billion won
---
Around $71MM USD. 
---
For context, there are plenty of B2B media publishers and technology companies that bring in comparable revenue. In one such case I am familiar with, a B2B tech company with comparable revenue but, significantly higher bandwidth needs, spends about $15MM USD on infrastructure and connectivity annually. I would be surprised in aNet spent about as much.  
---
Businesses that want to survive make tough decisions to kill of products, projects, programs, and initiatives that are proving too draining all the time. It is not a sign of the organization being unhealthy or in financial dire straights. It is a sign of a business making tough decisions to position itself for success, whatever that success might be. 
---
The game is buy to play. The f2p version is a glorified trial with many limitations. Expansions are pretty much mandatory if you want to experience major parts of the content and be on equal terms with other players. Noone feels "entitled" to answers, but the lack of communication always leads to unhappy customers. This isn't a charity project.
---
it is enough to keep Anet afloat, and make a profit.
---
even if everyone at Anet would earn 60k a year.
---
NCsoft being greedy, thats a different story.
---
They have confirmed Season 5 is still coming out with a regular release cadence. My understanding of Season episodes is they build two episodes at a time, so most of Season 5 hasn't been built and they are still saying it's coming out. In addition to the two expansions you haven't played, and the three available seasons you haven't played (you can't play 1, but 2, 3 and 4 are all available) there is plenty of time for you to experience all of what GW2 has to offer before Season 5 finishes (and that's assuming Season 5 is the end of GW2 and I don't think for a second that's happening).
---
Let's not start the name calling when I didn't say anything rude to you.
---
I edited my post, if you'd like.  Sure, we get a 'sizeable' content patch every 3-4 months in the form of a living world mission, maybe a map, that is a 'run-around-chase-the-leader' type of map.  The last raid was lackluster compared to previous ones and took more time to make.
---
They haven't done much since HOT to break up the druid/chrono/warrior being needed in all content for pve, and guardian/necro as backbone of every wvw raid.
---
I would much rather they release Living World in a single release, rather than an episode at a time.
---
I'm also not a free player.
---
My uncle works at ~~Nintendo~~ ArenaNet.
---
You're a special kind of idiot.
---
these mobas hat a lot more time running without any major other in sight, while battle royal games keept coming after another.
---
Also BR was starting much slower until it blow up and one of the newest genres
---
&gt;I don't know if a 30 min story mission which requires 8 players is ok for mobile games.
---
Well for starters you don't need players, you can solo the entire game with hero's. (I did).
---
2nd people play Xcom and Total War games on a tablet/mobile so why can't Guild Wars? 
---
Also I don't recall seeing anyone moving while casting skills, it always cut the skills off if I tried to move.
---
If JPrice is correct those employees were moved from GW2, so it's still bad news given that they seem to have no plans of adressing the current problems of the game in terms of content releases.
---
&gt; You know what would make a ton of revenue? if anet went full ESO mode and make you pay for every living world episode, as well as every new raid and fractal they add.If they added a monthly VIP sub for 10$ where you get to use your material storage.
---
&gt; ​
---
&gt; Thats what generates real revenue.
---
You mean, killing the game ? They would lose their playerbase on the spot. And not regaining a new one.
---
I love that the game play is more like an action/adventure game so I will keep playing too.
---
It's regular internet drama. Mountains out of molehills. They literally say in this story ""We can confirm that due to the cancellation of unannounced projects, ArenaNet will make staff reductions," the statement reads:
---
&gt; "This is part of a larger organizational restructuring within NCSOFT in the west, but the Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2 game services will not be affected, nor is any upcoming game content canceled."
---
They literally say Guild Wars 2 (and Guild Wars 1) will not be affected. Drama llamas take a nap.
---
Do you have a source for record profits at Blizzard? Everything I saw said record REVENUE. Which is of course very different than profit. 
---
This all sounds like armchair-game developer to me.
---
You can get any mount you want from the gemstore with no rng. Why bring that up? That hasn't been an issue for over a year. And how is any of this relevant to the game being on "maintenance mode"? WvW has always been neglected. I'm not saying it's okay but I'd say it's hardly an indication of the state of the game.
---
There are a lot of armor and weapon skins in-game that frankly I had no idea came with path of fire until recently. And they've added upgradable armor and weapons to the game with LS episodes more than they ever have.
---
If you should be critical of anything, look at the mountskins locked behind a paywall.
---
Mass Layoffs??   Like okay, 3 people have to find new jobs.  I sure in the North West they will have no problems finding new jobs.
---
"snowflake socialists"? mah dude, stop you're turning this from a good natured goof into something ugly and political.
---
They're probably not laying off everyone.
---
3 of these are just design issues that can be overcome through development. Graphics and 'limitations in map size' aren't even real problems unless you think mobile technology hasn't improved in the last 6 years. 
---
If you didn't realise, monetization has absolutely nothing to do with mobile games. It's not like someone makes a game for mobile and is magically forced by a cosmic power to put microtransactions in it, it's entirely down to the developer. Frankly it's ridiculous that people somehow forget that.
---
I made those comparisons to show that Anets only game isn't Gw2, it is in context of the OP, the compairsons where there to point out that these claims are wrong, not to support them.
---
I never said they've always been bad. Just for a long time now.
---
It'll be interesting seeing how this comes to fruition after LS5.  I have pretty serious doubts about a 3rd expansion; Cantha or wherever.  It really just doesn't seem like the game has been doing too hot.  I felt like LS3 was a lot stronger than LS4 was although I will say that the story was a lot stronger in LS4, but I felt like the maps were quite a bit weaker. 
---
There is a death recap where you can see what hit you after you die 
---
So? That's a problem with the market and profitability of mobile games. That has nothing to do with mobile games inherently. There have been plenty of great mobile games without shitty monetisation.
---
Welcome to the internet.
---
Yo mama is anet employee
---
I'm actually working on a battle royale project on my own for gw2 so please don't judge me if you see my thread in a couple days lol
---
If it was actually a Gacha, it wouldn't have been cancelled for being "not sustainable". 
---
To diversify their portfolio. It's a smart decision to work on other projects. I'd have made the same call
---
It's terrible though. Let me elaborate:
---
* Activities have been locked to specific days since years ago, which is a pointless restrictions that does more harm than good. Between other things, this move killed the Keg Brawl community. Activities should be free to play whenever you want.
---
* Custom Arenas should let you host activities as well, with a few modifiers here and there to keep things fresh. Bonus points if you let max-level guilds host their own Custom Arenas for free.
---
Now let's get into Southsun Survival:
---
* The activity needs its own map, built specifically for it, with hiding/ambush spots, narrow paths for traps, etc.
---
* Hunger is an interesting mechanic, but it's far too punishing. Either nerf it, or remove it altogether, and replace it with a shrinking area of play, like most BR games do.
---
* The players need far more skills. Either develop a new set of bundle weapons (ammo not being such a pain, too), or just let people use their profession's skills in the first place.
---
It would be pretty easy to make this activity (and the others) far more interesting and popular than what they are now, but ArenaNet has shown zero interest on anything beyond the LW over the years. New PvP modes and guild updates would have been easy to develop as well, with pretty positive cost-profit results, yet they never bothered.
---
Well, there was Stronghold, which was a half-assed MOBA. Either make it a full MOBA, or don't. Their obsession with reinventing the wheel is responsible of many of the game's problems.
---
for anyone wondering, the song in the background is "KSHMR x Yves V - Regrets (Dj Soda Music Video)"
---
Ok, cool story.  Its not like I don't have my problems with the game, but thanks for assuming that.  You're the one that posted quotes from someone that hates the company and even included the salty parts of her post that had no relevance to anything else she talked about.  I wouldn't have said the above if you hadn't done that.  I don't think the point of you posting was because you're worried about the game surviving.  Sounds like you want it to die.
---
I love the smell of content in the morning
---
ohh i remember your retarded username. but your history says you deleted your post.. too bad
---
Again, very true. But I doubt that those games had no presentable results that the devs/managers/higher-ups were content with, which does seem to be the case here, judging by the continued lack of information on what those projects are.
---
Don't get me wrong here, I'm not defending NCsoft's decision, hell no. They make more than enough profit, fuck those greedy shareholders. 
---
They're not design issues, they're limitations with the hardware.
---
&gt;unless you think mobile technology hasn't improved in the last 6 years. 
---
Hardware still has limitations. Even the most powerful PC has limitations. A mobile hardware is still behind PC hardware. We can't be throwing in massive GPU's inside tiny phones...
---
&gt;If you didn't realise, monetization has absolutely nothing to do with mobile games. It's not like someone makes a game for mobile and is magically forced by a cosmic power to put microtransactions in it, it's entirely down to the developer. Frankly it's ridiculous that people somehow forget that.
---
No, it's not restrictive to it, but mobile games are conducive to it. The casual nature of mobile games prevents people from spending lots of money on a game. It would be very hard to sell a game on Android for $60. So, in order to address this, mobile games are filled with micro transactions, plenty of which are predatory.
---
Nobody is forcing you to play computer games on your phone. It's perfectly possible to have games for phones that are good and exist at the same time as PC games.
---
Oh, my bad....I Didn't NOTICE the "good natured" content of people being JERKS to me
---
I usually see people blaming however many devs they have dedicated to WvW. As if every change or lack of change is due to the malpractice of these X people. You're right that it's a problem with the higher-ups not dedicating more people to WvW.
---
With all that said, like I keep saying, I don't see much of a problem with WvW. I'm very casual, and I get a lot of rewards both in items and in experiences. Just last night, I had a great back and forth experience at a camp. I normally roam, but attach myself to any commander I find in the area. I was running ahead of a zerg I had joined and saw a lone person waiting for RI on the supervisor. I barely kill them and then go for the camp when a zerg from that person's team comes over from behind the camp. I survive as long as I can, but I end up dying and the zerg starts killing the camp, but they must not have communicated well because the supervisor stayed alive without RI for a long time, long enough for the zerg I was in to catch up. I relayed how many there were and my zerg bombed them and took the camp. That's why I don't get the vitriol on some of this. Even when I hear about map exploits! Sure, they need to be fixed, but none of it really matters, just go somewhere else for &lt;5 minutes and then come back and undo their cheater work. The whole system is rewarding even if you're losing, just like in PvP. I'm using it to fill out my dungeon armor/weapon sets and I'm having a blast.
---
Ramble over.
---
No, actually. 
---
If you're salty and post a rant about it, I'm sure people will upvote you!
---
It's rude and you're making excuses to defend your bad manners.  
---
Same. But he was talking about a script and I wanted to figure out where to get one, so I talked to the heart NPC aaaaand got 20
---
Oh wow. That's so much damage. I used to never bother with it. Thanks!
---
Very astute of you to notice
---
Seems like pretty much everyone who read what you said didn't understand the point you were trying to get across. Maybe you should think about rewording it.
---
&gt; Some mobile games use shitty monetisation
---
Is not the same as 
---
&gt; Every mobile game has shitty monetisation
---
You are making blind assumptions about something you have zero information about.
---
Forgot all the little Snowflakes are afraid of salt............
---
Honestly, i enjoy full-map metas of HoT over anything else. I wish they'd put more towards that, new world bosses an maybe one more Dragon's Stand like experience (I feel like Kralk directly lends himself to that. Maybe should have had one for Balthazar too). They're somehow mistaking this awesome casuall MMO for a full single-player experience. It's like they're blind to the fact that people still massively play HoT maps and why that might be.
---
I'd also love to see more attention paid to WvW because no matter how hardcore everyone keeps sounding, it's the most accessible PVP gamemode i've ever seen in an MMO. It can absolutely be played as a casual and it's awesome at the start. I absolutely wish they'd listen to the hardcore player's wishes, because they've got legitimate concerns and are only really asking for changes that would make the mode more rewarding and fun without kicking new players to the curb.
---
Sorry for being snarky. I had to take a bit of time to think about this. This is honestly what i view as their strongest step forward if they wanted to take one. Focusing on these two pillars as well as story instances would do a lot for the game.
---
You are just asking to get banned, [dontya?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/atj1p8/arenanet_employees_who_participate/eh1c9x0/)
---
&gt;At1en0
---
i feel like you may have missed the fact that i was replying to the person above me, saying that an expac was not on the cards.
---
For example yes both WoW and FFXIV have a 2 yearly expac cycle, which is entirely my point; GW2, WoW and FFXIV are arguably the big 3 of the MMO world. GW2 will find it hard to compete in that arena if it doesnt follow a similar expac cycle to its 2 main competitors, of a 2 yearly rotation.
---
Living story just isnt enough to keep people interested for the long haul and were seeing that currently in game, as player numbers are down... due to people getting a bit tired of the current content. Which happens to every game after 2 years. A breath of fresh air with an actual expac worth of new content is needed this year.
---
As someone who plays WoW, FFXIV and GW2... yeh WoW has made huge missteps but its also still a behemoth in the gaming world. FFXIV, in general its community meets its expacs with excitement and without the same amount of moaning and complaining that the WoW community tends to lend itself too. Shadowbreakers for example has almost been universally greeted with excitement, as was Stormblood and heavensward.
---
What I have noticed however is that as WoW flounders, an increasing number of people are heading to FFXIV to get their MMO fix; if GW fails to deliver a new expac this year, i just dont see many new people wanting to jump on the GW train, which would be sad.
---
A lack of a new expac is damaging not just because it increases player apathy, but because it also shows a lack of development in the game itself... which puts off players from sticking around and investing more time into a game that might not have the longest future ahead of it. 
---
He didnt say that, dont paraphrase. He said he has doubts regarding the direction its going to go and what they will or wont release.
---
Imagine a ~~cow~~ dolyak on a warclaw.
---
&gt; Their resources are limited and while the unreleased ArenaNet titles might have been good opportunities, it could just be that a better opportunity exists and they had to choose.
---
And that's pretty much what I was trying to imply. Cheers for the better explanation. :P
---
R.I.P. alliance system
---
This game is so full of things they out out *and then never mention ever again*. 
---
Honestly, stuck some whacky prizes in this or make it have a chance of dropping ascended amulets or something and people would be murdering each other over and over again there. 
---
I have played very little of it, but I feel like the after death skills are too powerful as well.  One time I died pretty late in the game, and was able to get enough spirits or whatever to spawn a karka queen on some guy, taking him from pretty much full to dead.  Funny, but how can someone realistically defend against that?
---
The problem is GW2 is already impacted. For all we know, the expansion team was already on new projects and all GW2 has left is the living story team. We really don’t know but it seems like either ArenaNet or NCSoft has already decided they don’t see a bright future for GW2.  People can interpret it however they want but the lack of any expansion announcement after season 4 is not good. There are too many developers off the project. 
---
What?  Is that a threat?
---
Shame. I'm really looking forward to GW2 Gacha game...
---
I never made a post, nor deleted anything. How stupid are you?
---
Of course it was.  You make the decision to roll season 5 right after season 4 at the same time you decide you aren't working on an xpack and are instead pulling resources to ramp the launch of X.
---
This is very similar to the S1 to S2 gap.  That was a decision to pull resources from immediately working on an xpack with the hope that living story could substitute for xpack releases so they could instead focus on releasing Y.  It turned out that living story could not power their cash cow, and Y turned out to be vaporware.
---
So they are trying that trick again.  Will it turn out differently?  The revenue portion seems ok for now. Another xpack would be printing money, but on the order of tens of millions not hundreds of millions.  So it really depends on X.  If they launch a reasonable shot on goal, it could have been a good bet.  If they fail to launch?  Well, whoever is responsible for that decision should not get to stick around to make it a 3rd time.
---
&gt; You can check my history to see what I thought about her when she was first hired, and later when she was fired.

I'm sure people are going to want to go back several pages of your posts to see how you felt.  Why not just say it?  What are you hiding?  You felt it necessary to include the parts where she was toxic and now you're backpedaling/defending her statements.
---
&gt;Make complete nonsensical accusation that subreddit is secretly full of ArenaNet employees
---
&gt;Get downvoted
---
&gt;Use that as confirmation that you were in fact right and people are only downvoting you because they are secret Anet spies.
---
&gt;Make another post gloating about it
---
Hi kids, that's called a self fulfilling prophecy and shouldn't be indulged
---
I'm pretty sure they're not making enough money because most of the players don't buy gems. 
---
With good reason too.
---
When the subreddit page is just filled with Naysayers and people spelling doom and random speculations, what do yu think the average user is gonna think when they get on reddit just for a daily dose of interesting posts regarding their favourite game?
---
As this post mentions : [Worrying about the game dying is exactly what is gonna kill it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ate3ml/worrying_about_the_game_dying_is_exactly_whats/)
---
How do the people spamming "the game is dead, game is in maintenance mode, quit buying gems game is shutting down" help make the game better?
---
You may not be making those kind of comments, but they exist and are *upvoted* by the posse of whiners that have some vendetta against GW2 existing.
---
But that's not inherent to mobile games. I've played plenty of good mobile games without shitty monetisation. 
---
It's entirely down to the developer.
---
Then clarify what you're trying to do because, again, that is definitely not coming across from what you're writing. 
---
If the rumors are true, GW2 is just on maintenance mode, and they've been focusing on other games.
---
But yeah, communication and feedback analysis have been huge problems since release, even when the game was still their top priority.
---
That has nothing to do with you not knowing numbers.
---
You keep using the numbers of the ENTIRE Arena Net company as if they were all developing the game and then comparing it to the actual developer numbers of WoW and FFXIV.
---
Yeah like my original plan was to include dungeons and fotm as well but I wanted this as an opportunity for everyone to enter. I think that dungeons and fotm would just restrict the amount of people willing to enter, even though to require less people.
---
"maintenance mode", "easy to implement updates like balance changes".
---
so that's what it takes to get balance patches.
---
Do you have ascended gears in other stats? If you do it's easier if you just craft the exotic version of the insignia and use the mystic forge to stat swap.
---
Here's the wiki on it:
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stat_changing
---
So have 1 piece of ascended armor, say magi chest piece, craft a harrier gossamer insignia, buy an anthology of hero from Miyani, and put all that with 5 ectos in the forge and you'll get a harrier chest piece.
---
That's not your point, you're flatout comparing the entirety of a company to the development team of another game in order to say GW2 has more developers.
---
Wow, a person who accuses an entire subreddit of being from a company and *also* uses “snowflake” as an insult, and is literally bending backwards to make up a socialist consoiracy theory
---
"No idea what to do with Core Necromancer"
---
feelsbadman ):
---
That's true, but to be more helpful, why don't you suggest a better conversation instead of stomping on someone.
---
Because you’re pretty unlikeable dude
---
I wish I were as dead as your humour.
---
I am :)
---
That's the point. He is saying even if a lot of people leave ArenaNet, there are still a lot of people still working there.
---
According to one of the community MVPs on the Blizzard forums, WoW had around 200 people working on it, but it gained a few people after Titan was cancelled. Assuming that's correct, ArenaNet could layoff 200 people and still be competitive with staff numbers to WoW's dev team. If it follows the trend Blizzard did, GW2 might even see an increase in dev numbers.
---
Like Jim Stirling famously said, these companies don't want SOME of the money, they want ALL of the money.
---
"Staying afloat" isn't enough, City of Heroes is proof of that when it was not only afloat, but PROFITABLE and they still closed it.
---

---
&gt; Believe it or not, casual pve is not how you retain players because it doesn't offer anything once the content has been completed. Look at the last 4 LW maps.
---
lol. casual pve players are the ones keeping this game alive with their money. the pvp and wvw communities are contributing nothing to it... 
---
Imagine caring about karma.
---
I would trade yearly expansions for the free LW any time of the day.

You mean NCSoft Kappa

Can confirm my Dad works for Gamecube, and Nintendo is a subsidiary of Gamecube, and he wanted me go let you know you’re dad us fired.
---
Kids have no attention span these days. Now, if you will excuse me, I'm going to go yell at a cloud.
---
In times of corporate crises, official press statements are worded carefully before being released to the public. We likewise have to approach the messages with the same caution.
---
If indeed the GW2 teams were not affected, they would simply have said so. Instead, the official message was that "game *services* will not be affected". Game service is a rather vague term, and at the most basic level, may simply refer to keeping the servers running. Contrary to the topic title, Anet has made no explicit claims about retaining the Guild Wars teams, nor about maintaining the current level and pace of gameplay/content updates. The statement also adds: "nor is any upcoming game content *canceled*". Again, reading critically, this does not rule out the possibility of the content being delayed.
---
Of course, I hope that I'm being overly cynical. There's been an air of melancholy in my guild today. I want GW2 to thrive for many more years.
---
I am well aware of this, as someone who has witnessed the garbage that EA has pulled off over the last 15 years. (You probably wont believe it, but at some point EA games were good xD)
---
Are you on drugs?
---
D:
---
if you call a few boring story missions that last for 2 hours and have zero replay value a "sizeable patch" you are delusional 
---
basically play Scourge but take Bloodmagic instead of Scouge and you got yourself a dank Hybrid
---
everything is great in 5 man content
---
Funny, right?
---
They could also move most of them back and primarily layoff the people who never worked on GW2. We've already been told GW2 will not be affected by the layoffs and had a bitter former employee with an axe to grind against the company hadn't said anything, people wouldn't be talking as if there was a noticable shift in release content (the last episode was solid, the episode before was great), the example she used was only having one cinematic to use for the episode... which is the norm  for GW2. The only time I recall multiple cinematics for finales is when an expansion is teased with one of them.
---
What?  
---
short answer...no, long answer, never
---
Oh I agree with you it's terrible lol. I just posted this with the wave of people constantly joking about "GW2 BR inc" since the genre blew up.   
---
TBH I prefered Stronghold over conquest and wish they supported it rather than straight up abandoning it but alas. 
---
It has already happened for the PvP community, when ANet cancelled Pro league. Most of the community left, and the remaining one are disenchanted and toxic
---
Time for those Kitty benchmarks to shine ;\^)

We are all Anet employees on this (not-so) blessed day

Think upgraded Zephyrite gloves are nowhere to be seen. You can dye glow and inscription(on picture sun version). http://puu.sh/CQ7Gi/20427e80cd.jpg
---
Honestly, I'm ass at dungeons in general but I'd love to enter just for the fun of it. But I agree that many in the player base might not share that sentiment, sadly.
---
I don't feel like I suffered? PoF was a good expansion (not as farmable as HoT but that was a design choice not a lack of quality). Season 4 has been as strong as Season 3 (personally I think it was more coherent) and the release cadence has been the best it's been in the game's life. 
---
What suffering are you talking about?
---
Yeah, I said 'wild assumptions' with Diablo Immortal in mind. What's the monetisation model for that game? Have you played it?
---
But no. People saw 'mobile game' and immediately thought 'candy crush' or 'shitty clicker game 5.0'. They didn't think "maybe Blizzard, this large established developer that doesn't need to scrape together as much money as possible to survive will just release a game for its own sake".
---
You do know that many of the greatest accomplishments of mankind were done without publicly traded companies, right?
---
And yet, GW2 has had extremely slow content release especially when compared to what Anet put out in GW1 AND they don't have a product to show for what is supposedly years of work. It's honestly reminding me of BioWare who declare that they've been working on Andromeda/Anthem for over half a decade each and release unfinished work.
---
You don't even know me "Dude", except for some stupid posts.  My account could be part of a theisis or research, or in general stuff to stir the shit up.
---
Hmm best I can suggest is take the other classes into the pvp lobby, copy the metabattle build and just try out all the skills.
---
I would assume that SOME projects are being cancelled because they're taking too long. Just because non-GW2 products are highlighted as the problem doesn't mean ANet is now only developing GW2. They were probably told to cut everything but the idea or two most likely to succeed.
---
Yeah i could see that happening for fractals due to AR but dungeons do not even require ascended to be recordworthy, as within past 3 years some of the broken records featured players that have used exotic weapons and armor. If anything it has the least restricts of all. Some people also think raids are "inaccessible" or something due to them being called raids. I don't think anyone has ever said anything about dungeons really except that "they are dead"
---
&gt; i'm more progressive than you'll ever be in your life
---
But then...
---
&gt;jump to rash conclusions about who i am
---
I believe literally zero percent of what you're peddling here with your Holier Than Thou rhetoric. You bemoan my making assumptions about you while simultaneously making assumptions about me. How do you expect anyone to take you seriously? Shouting lies into the ether of the internet does not make you a better person.

Both games would be great if modding was allowed some day.

Hey, you can buy a lot of obsidian shards with your karma or convert it into gold.

That's a good point, actually. Thanks for the contribution.

Don't try to put words into my post, it is dishonest.  I NEVER accused ANYONE of being from a company.  Honestly, it seems like you guys are a bunch of haters.
---
The living story, while a neat idea, seems so stupid for the bottom line at the same time. 2 hours of content every few months isn't going to pull back people. An expansion with new classes/races/continents will.
---
Great project, I'm looking forward to many cool submissions!
---
Yeah you can't read.
---
My whole point is that people are saying that Anet only has Gw2 so any of those 400 would be Gw2 people fired when the point is that side project people got fired, those numbers are given as example on how ridiculous it would be that Gw2 would have 400 people devoted to it alone.
---
It took two years for them to make PoF and they began development right after HoT released. At the time they expressed regret they didn't begin development on HoT and Season 3 earlier. I would be very surprised if they weren't more than half done on expansion 3 already - if they follow the same timeframe as WoW, FFXIV and PoF's development cycle, expansion 3 will be announced and released later this year (PoF hasn't been out for two years yet).

Cries in SC2? You must not play it or keep up with the game. It has had a steady and large number of players and probably always will. It's got active tournaments and great support.
---
The main reason people shit on anet is because you never know when the next update is coming. They promised an ls episode every 2-3 months but sometimes that turns into 4, without any notice. 
---
There are also no roadmaps/plans for the future at all.
---
In ESO however you know there will be an xpack, a zone dlc and 2 dungeon dlcs each year, they also announced their plans for the entire year back in january, so people know what to expect and they get what they promised, which gw2 never delivers.
---
“6’raid wings a year and gen2 legendary AT HOT RELEASE”
---
No question posed, this was a direct causal accusation, "did one thing, got this as a result". Only problem is it's all predicated on a fictional connection that was established for the sole purpose of proving themselves right.
---
That's not healthy "honest or helpful".
---
I hope that was honest and helpful.
---
This is nonsense. People have been worried about WoW “dying” for literally the past entire decade and it’s still not happened. Even at its very worst it’s still the most popular MMO in the world. We aren’t magic, we can’t just will something in to being like that. Worrying about GW2 dying isn’t going to kill it- the publishers assassinating it like they do with nearly every non-korean MMO they get their hands on is.
---
And i have multiple more people upvoting these explainations of mine.
---
&gt;People who don't believe that western women have it harder than saudi women.
---
Have you been taking your pills lately?
---
The most annoying part of that article was that Price was interviewed for her thoughts.
---
That's a very impressive straw man you've built, there. I never proclaimed her a saint. I said she was right that people in executive positions will continue to fail upwards at the expense of non-executive developers. Also, I can plainly see your racist, bigoted post history. If you want to pretend to be some kind of liberal messiah to the lowly American "SJW"s, you might try deleting your disgusting posts and comments *before* climbing up onto that pedestal. You undermine your own arguments by virtue of your laziness. 
---
I'm curious about how much of this is/will be accurate in the future. Companies are getting better all the time at tracking consumers. This isn't happening now, I'm sure, but I can see sometime in the future when you would never see an ad for Guild Wars because the advertisers already know you've bought Guild Wars.
---
It's a saying?
---
I still remember the GW2 console versions that were rumoured before release. Ha. 
---
That's it ^^
---
I stopped keeping up with it a ways back when it had a massive decline. It's holding steady, sure, but it's nothing like it was in earlier WoL. Though, to be fair, that's also partially because of a shifting climate in gaming, particularly with the advent of MOBAs.
---
5? Afaik there are only 2 expansions. You cant claim that xpacks boosts sales less and less and have a sample size of 5, when there are only 2 expansions.
---
Actually you're forgetting another one of the beta weekend game modes, which actually was a true battle royale with most of the same rules as Southsun Survival.  You had to hunt for resources, the map explorable zone shrank (iirc), and when you died you turned into a passive robot observer who could follow people around but not interact. 
---
And if the game does die, we move on. It is not the end of the world as so many people - yourself included - seem to think. You need to stop looking at this game as your baby or your child or whatever thing you love and look at it as entertainment. Because that is all it is.
---
If the game keeps going for a few years - awesome! If it dies within a year or two(or even sooner) - oh well, those are the breaks!
---
Guild wars 3
---
We're all flame legion it's now a farmville + clash of clans + hearthstone esque type of mobile game.
---
We raise our own flame legion homesteads, fight other flame legion to steal their resources by sending our troops to their homesteads in which you play cards with heroes you got from spinning an RNG box to ensure you win.
---
But this other player spends more money than you, so they have better, stronger cards. Now you lost all your troops and now they're sending their troops to you.
---
Your homestead is gone, you're upset, so you start spending $500 a month to get good cards in order to keep up with everyone.
---
3rd part of the AA chain send mini projectiles (they don't bounce), Skill #3 is a projectile reflect / fires projectiles. Like you said skill#2 is a blink.
---
Basically the same idea, no? 
---
Well that was an useless nonresponse response.
---
No new news. They already said LWS4 -&gt; LWS5 was the plan. They can continue to plan all they want.
---
Still I supposed this is better than no response at all.
---
What would have been actually assuring was info of something new.
---
Speak for yourself.
---
It would make a lot of sense for them to release what they have, even if it was at a lower price point. They have an existing audience and expansions have reliably caused a large spike in profits before.
---
The danger is that there is no xpac and they just wanted it to appear that they were working on one.
---
dont forget how rene is retarded in sharing those boons tho,he clicks one fucking button and share perma ala. thats just demeted desing and it shoud been nerfed to the ground,thats my biggest problem in giving candy to classes which dont deserve any.
---
Why don't you ask "How many Anet employees do you people think look at this subreddit?  I think people would respond better to your post if you said that instead.
---
I wouldn't take anything someone says as fact. However her comments do allow journalists to follow up on the claim. They now have questions they can ask other current/former employees and the company. 
---
3. Unless you are hard core ppt this doesn't really matter just flip it when you can.
---
9. But you can do this with only 2 people if no one comes to stop you.
---
11. Server relink is Friday, so map and team chat are going to be more a gong show than normal as all the server idiots will be out in full force as the servers interact for potentially the first time, or if it was an acrimonious pairing last time then consider blocking people or turning off team chat all together.  You do probably want map chat on.
---
\-Other to know.  If a claimed tower has been held for over an hour watchtower can be placed on it and if it is this will mark enemies in range of the tower (keeps have this for 5 minutes after they flip).  So you need to pay attention where you are around watchtower level towers.
---
But it's still an issue because the GW2 team is smaller than it needs to be (much of the team have slowly been moved to the projects now cancelled, when they were still needed). 
---
It's better than nothing that they aren't reducing the gw2 team further, but the ideal solution would have been to cancel side projects and move the devs back to gw2. 
---
Not sure which you mean, but maybe it's in the [asset kit](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/media/asset-kit/)?
---
Some, plus they upgraded them to being functionally anything--down to being able to sigil swap at will outside of combat.
---
How do we know the exact size of the Gw2 team though? Aslong as it doesn't dip below 200 we should be fine?
---
&gt; 400 employees is a lot for a company of their size
---
???... That makes no sense, lol.
---
Theres a photo from 2018 i believe with over 300 people, all supposedly WoW Devs.
---
Consider there was only like 100 for TBC and 180 for Wrath.
---
More devs, lower quality work. Crazy.
---
The living world isn’t free at all. It’s only free per episode if you log in to every single episode’s window of new relevance. This is *abusively* punitive to new players, anyone who can’t play for a while, anyone who takes a break, basically anyone who isn’t playing GW2 as their only game. Expansions are an expected and understood cost of MMO gaming, and are a pretty easy pill to swallow, especially since they’re frequently on sale externally. More than half the game’s story content being locked behind an undocumented nearly sixty dollar microtransaction paywall that everybody pretends is free has killed more of my friend’s interest in picking up this game than literally any other aspect of it.
---
Thank you :)
---
to be honest i think that the main reason people see PoF as a good expansion is the mounts, without the mounts you have a forgettable story with some new maps that aren't as rewarding or fun as HoT and a couple new masteries drip fed in the LS. it really wasn't that good of an expansion.
---
it makes me not want to buy stuff because why spend money on a dying game?
---
Can we blame Anet for this though? All of anets chips are in Guild Wars. They don't have a ton of financial diversity which can be bad in the long run. 
---
I mean, yeah. GW2 is only making about $5m a month. Jeez.
---
We call them bessies or dollies.
---
Actually wanted to know something?   
---
Let me guess, people that go in without reading external resources and just try to figure it out on their own on their own time are part of the problem?
---
&gt;they churned out content as large as the original game in less than year for numerous years in a row.
---
While I don't disagree with you it is important to realize that Gw1 was probably much easier to develop in general, less things overall to worry about when designing zones and what not. Also the Gw1 campaigns could all be done in about 2 days or so or of going for 100% or near so a week max So not too much different from current.
---
We have absolutely *nothing* suggesting that's the case. 
---
Stop spreading that kind of information, it's what sends everyone into headless-chicken mode and helps absolutely no one
---
WvW people. 
---
I have a commander tag but don't do much WvW and I understand it has taken own etiquette and rules. 
---
If, during non-peak hours (I usually check in late morning to early afternoon ) I ran a "Join me if new" roaming squad to capture easy points, take down sentries, unlock ruins etc and other low effort stuff that I know how to to, would it help or hinder? 
---
I'm going to assume that people will want to hop in to get the Warclaw and some will sick around and some will never return.

Basically, to keep all us filthy casuals together and get in and out as quickly as possible while also showing them the basics so they might come back.

Good idea or bad idea?

It's not toxic and vengeful hahaha. It is actually a pretty accurate representation of wants going to happen. The people crying out against her in this threats, now that's a little toxic.
---
their statement has already been posted here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ataz6l/update_from_arenanet/
---
can we just get a megathread for this topic? i feel like many people are just using this as an opportunity for easy karma.
---
No!
---
Jeez!
---
They're NOT giving us another living season instead of a new expansion!
---
We're getting another living season instead of a new expansion!
---
What is so hard to understand about that? God!
---
I disagree entirely that content without expansions is bland. The "true" S3 finale inside Draconis Mons is one of the highlights of GW2 for me. Yes, PoF had a better Balthazar fight, but there was nothing about that which was bland to me. Bloodstone Fen was a fantastic map and a huge spectacle that I think beautifully sparked the season's intrigue. If they had done better with breadcrumbing Balthazar, it would have been even better. Can you honestly say that the Scruffy fight in Istan was bland? Like, there's obviously low points. I think Jahai was the only content release that DIDN'T have some aspect that I didn't like. But I can't see the content in Living World as "bland" compared to the expansions.
---
And as for professions/specs, I'm not particularly tied to them. At some point, they just won't be able to do them anymore. Like, everyone will have every weapon in the game. Some of them really could just be paired with a living world episode at this point.
---
imagine still watching wp at present day lol
---
Too soon.
---
She wasn't interviewed, they're quoting her public tweets.  It's not like they went out and sought her opinion directly.  She's one of the only people with inside knowledge talking about it, so it's worth mentioning even if she's a bit questionable as a source.  
---
I have a BA in Business Marketing.  That's why I'm able to complain about certain things Anet has done in the past.
---
No way man, calling someone an asshat on Twitter is a 'vicious attack'! I totally agreement with your statement. People were straight out for blood on this sub.  
---
this post reads like a first year comp sci student who majored in CS because they like to play video games but doesn't understand how development works and just throws around vocab words from their textbook to sound cool

tbh i agree with you, can't stand watching 15 minute + videos of people rambling about their thoughts, but if you don't want to watch it then just don't, i'm not. 
---
\&gt;Side stories to find, collections, etc.
---
Which are all the exact same kind of content: open world, non-repeatable, can be completed by a dedicated player in a matter of days (if not hours). The main focus of ArenaNet's releases for the past few years have always been the same: their two hour singleplayer story and non-repeatable open world content.
---
Yeah, it doesn't really solve anything. Don't get me wrong, expansions won't either, but they pack more of a punch. Meanwhile, raids, fractals, WvW and PvP, hell, even open world metas (you know, the content that actually keeps players invested in the long-term and not just for a week at most every four months) are either released at a snail's pace or all but abandoned.
---
Well shit, if were comparing.
---
283 mastery, 4 legendaries + full set of leggo armour. 6K hours over 2,372 days. Headstart aug 25th 2012. 
---
The game did have more players before, but this is nothing new. Being a gw1 player since factions you notice the decline. But the loyalists stick, it's those people that care most about the game. And I'm far from done. Next episode I'll have 5 legendaries. I have no intention of quitting or stopping my purchases on terms of gems. This is just a setback for part of the studio. Not so much for gw2's future. 
---
Thanks for playing o/
---
Or... it leads to a ramping up of loot box style stuff and grind to increase monetization, as with many of NCSoft's other games.
---
&gt; even **decent games** with in app purchases are highly profitable.
---
Key word: decent.
---
It’s extremely hard to create something successful on mobile. Trends change easily, it asks for lots of maintenance. If you put a price tag on it, you cannot reaaly go with freemium practices.
---
Even Nintendo is struggling with their mobile stuff.
---
Perhaps having 5 preset skins per mount with your choice of dyes for each. The mount menu would just have to have 5 slots for skins on each row
---
They actually removed rewards from it. It was originally released the first time the Labryinthine Cliffs map was release (and we first met the Zephyrites). Southsun Survival is the original source of the Desert Rose and Zephyrite Rucksack backpacks. They had a pretty high chance of dropping from the Southsun Survival reward bags (didn't even have to win iirc).
---
No it’s not. It’s clear  based on the past few years of development that there aren’t enough people on the project. And if you believe this, which I do:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/atb65p/rumor_arenanet_has_been_pouring_resources_from/
---
Then there is even more evidence that developers are being pulled from GW2
---
no, it has not. and it is not the same statement. 
---
nowhere in their statement on the forums have they said that both guild wars games and services will be not affected.
---
Too convoluted 
---
She kind of has a point though? That's how these things works, the exec's have a golden parachute but the hardworking passionate devs get to file for unemployment.
---
People are lazy and computers scare them. That's why they stick to a console and phones. Plug &amp; Play. 
---
"But computers are soo expensive"
---
&gt; Buys 500€ console and 800€ phone
---
the governments only care when they are being left out of a chance to grub some more money, you think they won't make it legal once they can figure out some laws that give them extra tax on it? honestly it's surprising me that they have left this loophole for ez tax open for so long. usually their greed sense is much sharper than that.
---
Consoles. Lel 
---
And your 'OMG THE SKY IS FALLING!!!' is not misinformation? The game may be dying or it might be perfectly fine. But your attitude of belittling and insulting someone simply because they aren't as obsessed with the game as you are is, frankly, wrong and unhealthy.
---
Calm down a bit. Just take a moment to realize that something you enjoy ending is not the end of the world.
---
I don't have blind faith. It is just, that either way, the world will keep on spinning. It is not the end of the world if GW2 goes belly up. That is all I'm saying. Corporate promises don't matter to me and do not effect my attitude in the slightest.
---
They have said the game will keep going. Cool! Oh, they were wrong/lying and the game goes away forever? Cool! Pass me the PS4 controller. I got 'Kingdom Hearts 3,' 'Valkyria Chronicles 4,' and dozens of other games to play. To say nothing of the PSX/2/3 and X-Box/360 games I have to play. And the DOZENS of games on Steam I own but haven't even installed yet. And the hundreds or boardgames I own.
---
The sky is not falling, Chicken Little. A game may be ending and that is all. Move on.
---
Strategy game where you play as an elder dragon trying to conquer the world of all those pesky adventurers.

You have to figure out his on your own. I wish you the best.
---
WS horribly underperformed.  It was overhyped as a WoW killer.  Think Bless Online, which runs at 5% of the current active players since launch.  Same with WS.  Only the most hardcore stayed until the end.
---
&gt;The layoffs are mainly about unanounced projects (other IP's or a Mobile Game). 
---
Isn't this entirely unconfirmed and only based on JPs tweets? 
---
my bad, wrong link. here you go https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ati49l/arenanet_layoffs_will_be_on_devs_working_on_other/
---
guild wars battle royale card game moba immortal clash 
---
I normally don't jump the gun but reading all the "oh they are probably going to shut the game down" got me worried a bit last night, but now that arenanet has clarified they scrapped some other shit but gw2 is still alive and healthy its restored my faith to continue playing.
---
But I totally agree, the doom and gloom will eventually turn people off of the game because some people are very negative Nancys.
---
Then as the population declines it really WILL die because of it..
---
The problem is MMO players not the games themselves.
---
You can go through any Gw1 campaign in 2 days of play time even back in the day it wasn't very hard, if you wanted to 100% any particular campaign it never took longer than a week of playtime. 
---
I don't disagree with your point overall but I think the real issue is replay-ability of said content. Like I said It didn't take long to do the content in Gw1 hell I had a pretty steady source of income when I didn't have a job doing GWAMM for people out of highschool but it had more replay value for-sure(or at least I feel it did/does). Gw2 technically has more content but the replay value on a lot of it just isn't there. 
---
Walking sucks.
---
WvW with faster travel and faster action sounds cool.
---
Two words: Hell No. I have already sunk a lot of money into gems for GW2, and I would rather see the game die than see it sell out to P2P.
---
You're right, people spending thousands of dollars into mobile games is totally normal and healthy. They're totally not designed to take advantage of people.
---
I like playing Gacha games, I don't think mobile games are bad in general. It doesn't mean I also can't recognize how predatory and disgusting they can be because that's what they're made with in mind.
---
Because devs like to get paid so they have houses to go home to and food to eat.
---
Im confused, GW2 will not be affected tho other statement said they couldnt do the amount of cinematics in the latest episodes that they wanted to... ?
---
Cant chat with guildies thro wiki. Or post trading post stuff on-the-go. Thank godness nowdays stuff like Discord is a thing.
---
Would've liked app similiar to WoWs one. Tho even that got cut down now (well the auction house part at least)
---
That dolly has been bugged for years... and instead of getting a fix we get a new mount...
---
This is why people are angry, we got ignored about bugs and exploits and instead get something unasked and unrelated... 
---
Oh well maybe a day it will get fixed.
---
I will be still working on it if you saw my comment a couple hours ago on a thread, just saying lol.
---
Elitism. Nice!
---
&gt; FF14 can manage people properly to make enough content for their game.
---
Yoshi P has mentioned during a fan fest that they wish they could find more people to hire, especially more experienced raid designers, but being a Japanese company, they need to be fluent in Japanese too. I just find it funny that even though they keep up with the three to four month content cycle, they still could use more for what they would like to do. 
---
New player experience usually refers to things that weren't even good during launch such as the Zhaitan fight. That's a debate on its own but it's usually stuff like that they're referring to.
---
This has a ton of good info, thanks for the link!
---
They aren't cutting gw2 staff..post killed
---
Yeah I get that but unfortunately I had to announce it this week as I have some unexpected plans for next weekend which means that I wouldn't be around to do anything useful.
---
Oh thats sweet! Im from Greece but I play on NA, add me ingame if you want so you canwhisper and ask help and such if you need to :D happy to meet more people during my timezone too
---
I didn't ask to be honest. I'm not partnered with Anet so I wouldn't even know how to ask haha
---
Maybe more of a board game or Adventure Wars style. 
---
Apparently wanting a game to have the possibility of failure is called "elitism". If so, YES. Very nice elitism over patronizing pandering any day.
---
Cool! Thanks. 
---
This. Your point is super valid. Here's the thing though, if the devs in charge of guild wars 2 don't start showing true signs of transparency about what's going on - the game without a doubt will die.
---
 This is a huge pr move and the perfect opportunity to change things, and one thing that has been super awry is some sort of communication as to what's happening behind the scenes. 
---
Got it, will look at those settings, thanks!
---
"Maybe" he said. That's just proposing an alternative other than doom and gloom -- which I think is fair, because nobody should be forming an opinion either way without considering possible positive effects as well as negative. Very few things in this world are only one or the other. Changes usually bring far-reaching ripples of both.
---
That's just the rotation from SC.
---
Do this side story: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Knight_of_the_Thorn
---
Lots of exploring and an ascended weapon at the end
---
you know what wouldnt make money for them??? investing in either pvp or wvw!
---
Face it, no one gives a fuck about those modes. like the pvp player base and wvw player base are tiny compared to the pve player base.
---
your amazing "spend money to make money" advice is grand and all, but lets face it... spending money on a niche area of the game that even most the player base cant be fucked with is a none starter.
---
They would be much better scrapping any development in those modes altogether and just focus on pve. Thats where 90% of mmo players want to be.
---
FFXIV has given up on pvp in all honesty, so has WoW and GW2 has been giving up on it really for years.
---
Their is literally zero proof that mmo players want more pvp content en'masse, its just simply not the case.
---
Your entire post actually screams of "i love pvp and wvw, invest more in that because i personally like it!!!", but like theirs fuck all microtransactions that actually function in those modes really... so its incredibly hard to monetarise while still keeping it fair and even.
---
With a shit load more modes in pvp; it would attract literally zero people to GW2. all it would do it let the tiny pvp community be happier and frankly thats not a great allocation of resouces, energy or money. As keeping 5% of the player base happy at the expense of the game itself and its predominantly PvE players, is just pointless.
---
You attract more MMORPG players, by providing compelling pve content. Thats a simple fact.
---
If it comes down to money, scrap pvp and wvw development altogether and just focus on PvE; as frankly thats what theyve been doing for years anyway, its what every major MMO has done, its what GW1 did.... as all evidence shows that MMO players primarily want more PvE content.
---
It says  "Noon Pacific Time (UTC-8)" and its 09.46 now in Pacific Time so if i assume it will start around 12.00, it should start in a couple hours from now.
---
PP Very Hard
---
I cannot help but note that she, alone, is sermonizing (heavily) in her tweets about this situation. Every other Anet employee I follow on Twitter, both current and former, has been reaching out to us and to one another. To offer comfort, support, and even make a suggestion for future employment.
---
Watch the last 30 seconds again. But ok 
---
For me it’s the other way around. I had plenty of patience for his videos as a kid but as a working adult I can’t stand YouTube anymore. 
---
No music and terrible armor skins! Not worth a watch!
---
Watch the last 30 seconds again. 
---
where are your stats? oh right you just made them up
---
Could you share the Daredevil Build? 
---
alright nvm then!
---
I don't understand why you're so angry at my comment. EVE and GW2 have absolutely nothing in common. WoW was the MMO phenomenon that popularized the genre so much whether people like it or hate it, never claimed otherwise. I also never claimed that GW2 is dead. Both games have seen a decline in players though, which is a fact and normal for older titles.
---
Is it better to not believe that there are layoffs to begin with? Just read it on the Internet, I would not want to be found gullible.
---
You can't make promises when you don't know how many employees you will have left. Only once they know will they be able to commit to something. It's impossible to deliver a time line when you don't know how many developers you will have. 
---
Yes but that's still no reason to go NOTHING IS HAPPENING, 100% CONFIRMED
---
it is.
---
I ALONE CAN DIAGNOSE THIS PROBLEM! IT WAS BECAUSE NONE OF YOU LISTENED TO ME! CAUDECUS THE WISE!
---
It was Arenanet not GW2. Not everything Arenanet makes has to be guildwars themed
---
I keep forgetting about the dailies XD
---
I'd expect it to require PoF, or they change monetisation model for LW and it's a separate season pass style purchase.
---
Thanks for the info, I keep seeing people with that title and was wondering where to get it. Thanks for helping me be lazy and Googling it for me :P
---
Corporate culture turns everything it touches into utter shit.
---
There's an AAA crash coming, I hope this culture disappears once it's over.
---
Yeah, making LW episodes DLC if you weren't online at the time has always been such a dumb decision. I bet it keeps more players away than keeps them in.
---
That sounds fun, I’ll take a look.
---
I'm still waiting for Basket Brawl to be implemented completely. The trial period they gave us was barrels of fun. Gotta be one of my favorite activities so far.
---
Well of course I don't have an argument. Why would I bother coming up with one that's so baseless? The OP literally admits to it being speculation, and doesn't say anything new.
---
So yeah, very much 'out of arguments' because like I said, there's nothing of value to argue about.
---
Sounds useful, thanks.
---
The layoffs seem to be all of people that weren't working for gw2 since PoF release, so who knows
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm very sad for the ones getting laid off, but at this point, I'm hoping the ones getting laid off are just the ones hired from outside for these new projects and the rest are being moved back to GW2
---
- Daily events. Not the quickest daily but fairly easy since there are always tons of people doing them.
---
- Roller Beetle races. Zoom zoom.
---
- World Bosses. [Check the timer](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Event_timers). There's also an achievement category for them, and a few have their own achievement categories.
---
- Dungeons. Still fun and you can make some decent gold, as well as a lot of mastery experience.
---
- Jumping puzzles. If you like that sort of thing.
---
- [Mini dungeons](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mini-dungeon).
---
- Mastery Insights. For core Tyria mastery points.
---
- Various achievements: Slayer, Weapon Master, Explorer...
---
- Have fun!
---
The only one I am disappointed won't happen is pokymock. Linked to my account to only use minis I've unlocked in game. Would be amazing but would probably also destroy the mini market as there would inevitably be 2-3 that are just OP and everyone gets them for the Polymock meta.... ok I just talked myself out of wanting this. 
---
I understand that. It's just a curiosity given that the rumors were phrased as people specifically being taken off GW2 for the purpose of other projects.
---
Again, we're lacking in information (ANet probably is too at this point), so I'm kind of wondering out loud.
---
Would I blame them? It depends on how much of this is true.
---
Creating additional sources of income for the company by developing additional games? Great! Mobile in this case is even better since it would avoid competing with your main game.
---
Using profits from existing game to fund it? Reasonable.
---
Gutting the funding of existing game to fund multiple other games' development? DUDE! Why are you aiming that gun at your own foot???
---
Cuz living story is shit. 
---
No panic given. Gave up on this game a long time ago. Information leaking out now just confirms the fact they have players for "easy to trick" casual fucks to farm for money.
---
Everyone just buy some gems!!
---
In 2 hours.
---
&gt;  It makes roughly 4 million $ a month,
---
That's higher than what I thought it would be. Did this come from some shareholder report or something?
---
Thanks a lot! I didn't think about mixing and matching armor
---
I dont think they'll stream unless they adress the news before it.
---
It will come eventually the problem is when ?
---
Oh yeah definitly, we've seen it build up during the last year. Can't wait for these giant corporate to fall and let room for competent devs to finally shine. 
---
I'm a dev myself and it's been this way for too long. We're ask to perform and out perform everyday but never get any credit while the dumb asses at the top gets everything. 
---
Anyways... Indie devs are starting to get more and more appreciation when comparing to big publishers so it's a good start.
---
Ncsoft only owns 25% of Arenanet
---
Hello, Mr. Peter.
---
I'd be fine with that.
---
Monthly subscriptions are a deal breaker for me, but I think paying for chunks of new content is perfectly reasonable.
---
WoW releases one small daily zone, or small questline (nothing compared to living world), every 6 months for casual players - yet it goes on. 
---
For not-so-casuals there is new raid in the patches. But even tho the raids have 8-10 bosses, each with actually good mechanics, even that wont keep people for long. Its essentially 1-2 hours of content too after you learn the fights. It just resets each week and you have reason to repeat it over and over because gear rng drops...
---
Hell, LoL only does champions and has one map
---
There just isnt "THE" formula to keep massive amounts of players playing. All games struggle with it.
---
pretty sure op didn't say that but ok
---
Action games you have full control of your character, press a button and you can attack. So it works well on consoles, games like gw2 so many skills and buttons to fit onto a controller.
---
They explicitly said Season 5 and no upcoming game content has been cancelled. They said they will move directly from Season 4 to Season 5 and they "plan to continue a regular cadence of updates and releases" which is the same as before the layoffs were announced. 
---
Stop trying to see what's not there.
---
Well then they are royally screwed since investors never seem to be happy. If they have enough investors this can even be true without having to add any cynical spin to it!
---
yeah is was coming from minecraft and the movie but i don't think there was a real game out yet which focused on this game mode
---
There are way too many for me to actively just go for them. If I hear of a good one I usually try for it but just doing them all, that would hurt my brain looking at all of them.
---
That is so true, from my job experience the last thing a company want to do is lay-off staff, as the staff are the company’s greatest investment and it’s the last resort.
---
Sometime it’s the best thing to do to ensure the company’s survival on the long run, and as said usually when time do get better they are the first people invited back and most staff are understanding based on the company spendings.
---
Like I can’t understand how Activision hire a guy and give him 15 mil and fire 800 employee. While in the case of Anet guild wars are their only IP and they are being afloat.
---
It’s always hard to see people lose their job it’s the kinda industry it is. I faced the same issue in the aviation and hospitality industry after 9/11 the hotel I was working for went from 80% occupancy on average to 3% and the business was bad. My family travel agency was hit hard with all the cancelation and increase of security tax’s. It was so hard to see people you work with had to go.
---
Anet need to step up and make some money to ensure the sustainability and security of the company and staff.  They need to get out of their bubble and start listening to the players and get things right.
---
I’m not saying he’s wrong for keeping an open mind but no matter how you cut it; in essence saying “oh look a whole bunch of people are gonna lose their job, maybe it will make the game better”; is still a fairly optimistic spin on a fairly shitty circumstance.
---
Like sure, it “could” improve the game; chances are it totally won’t though. 
---
This is all speculation and rumor, but maybe they didn’t have enough people working on GW2 to begin with because those people were doing other projects.
---
If those other people were let go.. well GW2 would still be left with the small amount of people working on it.
---
Though if the devs were devs that were once on GW2....
---
I see ff14 on consoles with 30+ skills and works just fine :)
---
I was hoping for something that would actually give me something I could use :P
---
But the content that GW2 produces for replayability doesn't have much difficulty which immediately makes a portion of the playerbase less interested. On top of that, what happens when people have the skins they want? Arenanet aren't producing many new ones so that runs out far quicker than a traditional gear grind for higher stats does.
---
Personally I think metas are fine and can offer some replayability however they lack massively compared to raids which can clearly keep people playing them for years. Of course, there isn't any real reason why Anet can't do both and make easier raids through changes as simple as different loot and making them doable by 15 people. 
---
I didn’t know muni dungeons were a thing, I’ll take a look at those. As for normal dungeons, can you do those solo? I thought no one liked doing those anymore.
---
The cinematics statement was from Jessica Price... dunno if you trust her... i don't.
---
That tweet makes me all the more appreciative of what the devs have done, because they absolutely pulled it off. Jahai, and even AoN in the story section at least, was phenomenal. I really do hope that this was a correction to having too many alt projects and that the "fix" is coming early enough to save the company and the game as a whole.
---
Okay.

---
HI3 - https://youtu.be/mtH42MNVTMc?t=2m30s - bunch of girls killing crabs and their friends.
---
they have said for about 1h 30min ago
---
Especially after how anet reacted to the blizzard layoffs. It really sounded like they were not aware of what ncsoft had coming for them ...
---
Back in the days when anet was really open about communication, I'd see like 3-4 forum posts/week linked to reddit on something devs said. Nowadays I'd say we're lucky if we get that every month or so. But I'd really like to see the efforts in communication they did back then.
---
If expansion 3 is released this year, that would mean we'd be done with season 5 in ~9 months. No way this is happening, unless season 5 only have 2 episodes (s4e6 hasn't been released yet).
---
I farmed SS during those times and made good gold with the Desert Roses. They were not that hard to get but still decently valuable on the TP. 
---
That's true, the execs always get out of this sort of thing scot-free, and the regular workers suffer.
---
But the fact that she specified "male" there (to be totally fair to her, the overwhelming majority of execs are male) suggests that she was definitely feeling some angry passion when she posted this information, and her personal agenda was definitely on her mind, too.
---
IMO, that makes *all* of the information suspect. It doesn't necessarily make it *false*, but it definitely means there's a possibility that her very strong feelings have colored either what she said or even what she remembers.
---
I'm not saying to discount everything she says immediately, but I *do* think it's very important to consider the veracity of information that's coming from a biased source.
---
"But beyond Season 5, well that's when things get a bit scary.  The idea of getting an expansion at all. Will we ever get to go to Cantha? These are the big questions that now, I must say, even myself I have these niggling doubts. Surreal stuff, pretty scary. Particularly someone that has dedicated the past few years of his working life to covering this franchise, I have to say...I'm not feeling the best right now."
---
What in there says he doubts the game will continue past season 5?
---
You're making an assumption without all the information, and the primary information you have is half made up of leaks from an employee who was fired and has publicly expressed ill will towards people at ArenaNet.
---
It's simply irresponsibly to give those comments any credibility - even if there are shades of truth, selectively chosen information released at the right time can be used to push a false agenda and cause harm to a company by misrepresenting what's really happening.
---
Why are you still here then?
---
No, I am telling you that I am not interested in refuting something without a solid point, let alone your weird trolling attempt lmao
---
I said he has his doubts. Not that he doubts it will. Thoughts are two different things. 
---
Unfortunately if her words on that point are a lie they are so cleverly concocted that reason actually indicates they are right. Game companies often work on side projects. Good games often come of side projects. But in this case it looks like they subverted way too much resource time. 
---
The shit is coming directly down from ncsoft and probably as a surprise to everyone at anet. The way they reacted to the blizzard layoffs really sounded like they didn't know what ncsoft was about to drop on them.
---
Do you mean achievement points?  If you're only at 600 then there are plenty you have available.  Finishing any story steps are normally quick and rewarding.  Crafting is also fast and cheap if you use a guide.  Playing through dungeons on Story Mode is also quick easy points.
---
I wasn't really flexing but ok. Just don't assume that someone is not playing the game out of nowhere. Have a nice day :)
---
&gt; experience different today from the last time they changed it
---
Its oudated. It does not explain new features and mechanics. It does not make new players aware of what content game actually offers them. 
---
If you think years without updates to stuff players can earn from one of primary endgame PvE activities is okay, then we see it very differently. 
---
the revenue you have seen from ncsoft page is not all. NcSoft only owns arenanet to 25%
---
This exactly like class balance could of been easily done better ages ago let's not forget how long revenant was neglected.
---
Un-knowable foreign entity that swoops down and destroys everything in an instant? It fits.
---
no u
---
You are blowing his words out of proportions. If anything, he is saying he doesn't know what is going to happen, not he doubts the game will continue. Very different.
---
You got quite a list of suggestions already, one map I see hasn't been  mentioned is Silverwaste. It's the map to go to for farming in central Tyria, I like to hang out there whenever I'm in the mood for some mindless game play.
---
Move on...
---
Conversation over...
---
Stop obsessing...
---
Like what? Episode 4 was one of the best releases we've seen, we just got our fifth episode with a fairly regular cadence which immediately followed an expansion launch (which was preceded by a regular cadence of episodes as well). This has been the longest period of stability GW2 has gone through without a content drought since Season 1 ended. I agree with people who found Thunderhead Peaks to be pretty ordinary, but I've found many releases throughout every season to be ordinary. 
---
There was an entire mount released this last season, another one will be released next week. PoF hasn't been out for two years and it has seen three fractals and two raids so far with more coming.
---
How are people seriously arguing that GW2 is crippled atm?
---
&gt; But the content that GW2 produces for replayability doesn't have much difficulty which immediately makes a portion of the playerbase less interested.
---
That's just the thing, how hard do you think FFXIV is? The only hard portions of the game are 8 man savage raids that come out once every I think 6 months and maybe an Ultimate Trial like Ultimate Weapon Ultima from time to time.
---
I enjoy seeing snowflakes getting screwed on a daily basis. 
---
Gw battle Royale can be a good mobile game where all gods of tyria fight each other for something.
---
People have argued all these things throughout the entire history of GW2. Different parts of the game have always competed for attention and that attention ebbs and flows. The WvW players are always unhappy with their lot, as are sPvP players (both those game modes benefit from stability more than constant upheaval and evolution like PvE demands). Fractals and raids don't get a tonne of content but nothing noticeably worse than in the past.
---
You all put so much weight into the rumors started by a fired employee with a grudge against the company and the community.
---
I'm actually kind of mad IGN is capitalizing on ArenaNet's misfortune right now, considering they've done no real help to the game since launch. They had almost no coverage for HoT except for a final review, and in that review they described almost exclusively positives for the game and still gave it a 7.5 if I remember right.
---
Then came PoF, and IGN never once took a look at the game, not even for a game review. It seems wrong for them to get ad revenue from these layoffs but never give publicity to the game releases...
---
Shadowbringer trailer spoilers: &gt;!Kid Minfillia is actually seen with Thancred so she is back. Granted Kidfillia probably won't be telling us to go the Waking Fucking Sands every other quest so this may be fine.!&lt;
---
Not all of them. ArenaNet had around 400 people, there is no way 400 people ever worked on GW2.
---
GW2 releases have been much more substantial compared to post-Eye of the North GW1.
---
Yes that's basically where we are with GW2 now. End of boxed releases.
---
Why is everyone flame legion though? :( 
---
They should have content that is in their last development cycles by now. If ALL of that content is purely living world episodes, I am \*VERY\* concerned!
---
Lv1 Skritt - Lv100 Steve
---
I've always the "catch 'em all" aspect or ranger pets. Need a tank pet? Done. Need a condition pet? Done. Need a power pet? Done. 
---
core necro should run pre-hot builds like thats pretty obvious. condi would do better than power
---
Self-illumination? that's when you stick a lightbulb up your ass while it's connected to a socket right? asking for a friend
---
&gt; But I don't trust NCSoft. They buried a self-sustaining game because it didn't fit in their preferrerd market (South Korean gamers) and because their newest projects weren't hitting their marks.
---
Also why do they have some many products that competes with each other?
---
The fact that you are going on about supporting some greedy company is sad to me. And before I get flooded with comments “that’s just business” doesn’t make it a morally good thing to do.  The fact the “business” has become trying to please some board so they can take in multimillion dollar pay checks while firing their employees is disgusting. Players of these games should be disgusted and in my opinion walk away from shitty companies like that, not spending more money to support their greed. 
---
Thank you
---
Unfortunately, devs typically don’t have the capital to develop a game for 6 years without seeing a profit. Crowdfunding is helping that be possible, but for bigger scale things, we are still a ways off.
---
Dying is a naturally process of any game as a service. Guild Wars 2 has survived quite alot years and I think after all this time if slow content-development and grinding the same stuff for years now it is time to await a successor to the game. No expansion, no living world season anymore but a brand new Guild Wars game that unites their experience from the last 7 years and modern technology in one game that will even surpass GW2.
---
3 ideas up there for anet to improve on if they want to keep players around, the same 3 ideas that fill their forums every single day.  If their leadership team isn't going to listen to what players want, the game is going to die.
---
&gt;I'm not worried about the game dying, I'm worried about Anet staying quiet on this situation. If there ever was a time for them to talk about whats in the pipeline, its now.
---
This. there was a good thread a few days/week ago that mentioned they go about the announcements all wrong -- staying quiet to build hype in the current climate only creates anxiety, not excitement.
---
When was this recent mention? Riot started up a fighting game team after the acquisition of Radiant Entertainment in March 2016 (almost three years ago). I'm personally aware of another project from 2016 that got cancelled. Marc Merill said that they've had multiple exploratory projects in the works since 2017 [in an interview](https://variety.com/2018/gaming/features/riot-games-next-game-league-of-legends-1202892072/).
---
It's a game, not post secondary education.
---
Why people taking this as console vs PC thing? as for the controls, I would say never say never. People were saying the same thing about shooting mechanics but mobile shooters like PUBG changed the whole industry. Play in PC, but what's wrong if the company gets good revenue from other platforms? 
---
Wut.
---
And WvW? Could I just be strolling along and walk right up to an enemy without knowing? Or is there a "cap" so that up to X amount of players show up and then beyond that they dont?
---
20 points into Provisions Master 
---
WP keeps making money off anet staff being let go and it's fucking ghoulish.
---
I've almost completely stopped playing pvp.  balance and neglect have gotten so bad there's really no point. wvw is in the same boat.  what's left? casual pve maps, fractals, and raids.  living world maps take an afternoon to complete, that doesn't keep players around.  fractals devs aren't listening to players either, how many of the new instabilities are well received instead of being just frustrating to play with? the raid community is even smaller than the pvp community.  Anet made this bed with shit decisions, ncsoft stepped in to correct it. i'm just hoping they didn't wait too long
---
Yeh it’s that I was referencing; but mostly I’m just hoping Minfilia secretly loved the D and this is a secret love child they’ve found.
---
Not the same daft bint who took credit for everything I did for a whole game!
---
(Don’t get me started on Lyse doing exactly the same shit!)
---
Jumping puzzles are 10 AP each, though you may or may not be good at them.
---
PvP also has a pile of achievement points tied to it, though that might not be the fastest grind.  But there's achievements for winning with each class, as well as achievements for increasing your overall rank.
---
Check out the main forums, particularly the pvp and wvw sections. See any trends?
---
&gt; Follow ESO sell player houses and let players have multiple houses, sell decorations there's literally a plethora of god damn reusable assets to milk there for little work at all....
---
Yeah dude when people are getting angsty about not getting enough repeatable content, let's allocate resources to content that's not playable at all, great idea.
---
Garrisons worked so well for WoW right?
---
Who buys gems when the only content is a living world map that gets completed in an afternoon every 3 months?
---
It’s useful as a glorified DVD player along with streaming service apps :\^)
---
So if we narrow this down to the "support" roles you have the following options: Ranger = Druid (Heal support), Revenant = Renegade (hybrid DPS/Boon support), or Elementalist = Tempest (Heal support).
---
Druid translates the easiest between Fractals and Raids in terms of gearing and demands of the role. Renegade is kind of in a niche spot which demands a lot more out of the player to achieve meaningful results, and Tempest is very niche and only sought ought in very specific encounters (though it can be a nice additional supplement to activies not capped in size such as WvW or open world).
---
I would say... If you want something a bit easier to pick up and is commonly accepted, work on the Ranger as a Druid. You can pick up some gear on the side to try out Soulbeast for DPS as well. Power-based SBs are pretty alright to have in Fractals and you can mix it up between power/condi for raids. They're a bit less sought out for group settings in game modes like WvW, though.
---
If you want something with more of a learning curve and higher demands on individual performance, try grinding out experience with your Revenant. Both the Renegade and Herald classes can be turned into viable supports, though Renegade is currently more sought out in PvE scenarios in the support capacity (for the Alacrity) and condi damage builds. Herald has a few niches as well, but both elite specs can be fantastic to have in WvW as damage/hybrid roles. You can also build your Renegade for use in PvE with a bit more healing power mixed in to push your group's sustain further.
---
I'm heavily biased towards Elementalist because I find the attunement system to be very fun to juggle - especially as a Weaver for dps roles. I don't think they're really in a good spot right now for someone seeking to play them primarily as support, but there are niche setups which allow for some engaging hybrid support/damage builds as Tempest. You'll be far more effective as DPS with this class, though. There are only a couple of raid encounters in which the Tempest is actually a viable option as support, but then again most raid encounters can be completed with a ragtag composition anyways.
---
Given the amount of dust that seems to have been swept under carpets I expect it to be a horrible mess.
---
The build is the same as the one found [here](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/thief/daredevil/power/), but in the Deadly Arts traitline, you take Improvisation instead of Executioner.
---
In about 1 hour 7 minutes. I doubt anyone to talk about the news. Mainly because it looks like it is affecting mostly unannounced projects being cancelled. I do kind of hope Z will maybe try and explain what will be happening with GW2 going forward.
---
3 months of dev time to create an afternoon's worth of content is a shit business model.  That's exactly what i'm saying, they'd be better off spending those resources on repeatable end game content and balancing/qol features, those are what draw players in and keep them around so they buy gems.
---
Hmm. All the Explorer and Jumping Puzzles achievements are pretty fun. 
---
wiki + gw2efficieny + gw2timer + other social functions (chat/mail/TP etc.) would make for a great app though. 
---
It's great to see that all of the gem money has been spent on shit side projects instead of being invested back into gw2.  Really nice for the playerbase
---
Eh it was the most fun I had in this game with pvp since it wasn't a visual clusterfuck like teamfights are  and have always been in conquest. Stronghold needed work  absolutely  but I wouldn't call it a waste of time. Actually I think it became a waste of time when they said "fuckit" and decided to never update it. What they spent time developing went to waste. 
---
Their Eis people who care on karma? Lol
---
everything will die eventually
---
some take 1 year others take a lifetime
---
but nothing lasts forever
---
She complained they only got one cinematic for episode five and instead had to have us walk down the cave to find Aurene instead of a cinematic (which worked better than a cinematic imo anyway). It is in no way a big deal they could only do on cinematic for the episode - we are used to getting none. Her twitter posts are manipulative BS intended to harm ArenaNet and the GW2 community.
---
&gt; Man the sub feels like it has gone into full denial mode now. Only in this game will you find people that will spin layoffs into something positive like "oh they will finally get their shit together".
---
I like how the general snetiment is "oh these people working on other project were siphoned from GW2, so we won't feel it! now we're back at full speed!"
---
Excuse me, what? Which part of layoffs do people not understand? Thos siphoned people will be fired, not reabsorbed by the GW2 team.
---
Developers are going to be fired, so there won't be anyone to fix this unfortunatelly. That's her home now ^^/s
---
Pve is by and large my favorite game mode, it's a chore to have to play pvp or wvw for collection items or skins or whatever.  It would ruin the game for me if they focused more on pvp/wvw that pve.  I want the story and new maps and fun stuff to keep coming!  I'm bored or mad within 30 mins of pvp/wvw.
---
Not saying they shouldn't add improvement to pvp/wvw, but it definitely should not be a main focus.  Pve is what I want in an RPG.
---

---
.....improve shareholder value :/
---
It doesn't have to expand. If it's doing things well and sustainably, there's no reason to keep overreaching past what it can viably support. 
---
How does the “queue” system work for dungeons? I know it’s not a proper queue but how does it work? Can I easily find players through it or must i find a group on my own?
---
I absolutely hear what everybody is saying; profits go back to the company, not the game. I think the better way to maybe put the original poster's comment was to say that the poster is feeling anxious because they put a lot of money into the game and now it feels like none of that is going to matter because everything they bought is going to be virtually useless as the game feels like it's in danger.
---
But, I think it is fair to say that original poster might feel betrayed. They made purchases and the presumption was the game would be healthy for years, and they were helping to support it.
---
Folks talking about business, are completely right. I don't think we're talking about business, I think we're talking about buyer's remorse and anxiety and worry that something that they feel they have invested time and definitely money into might just be all for nothing. 
---
Granblue itself does that because they have a pretty good story and have a lot of recognizable people working on it. A lot of earlier adopters came because the art director and composer were from Final Fantasy.
---
The game itself manages to hold people because Cygames actually cares about putting effort into it and developing it like an actual game. It's by far the most I've enjoyed the actual gameplay of a gacha game because they understand their main draw is Granblue brings a bit of everything to the table so the actual core game needs to be enjoyable.  
---
This a great point. Agreed.
---
&gt; Anet streched itself too thin with side projects which didn't seem to have a release in the close future thus no income.
---
Ah, so the notorious "poor lotsa work into a new feature, ship it and abandon it", just this time without the "ship it" part.
---
hahah none of us will take part
---
Wow, thanks for the very detailed response.  I do agree that it is fun to change between the attunements on the Elementalist.  Helps to have a good DPS chance and be able to heal in a pinch.  I normally won't mind to DPS, but many times I feel like in MMORPGs, if the DPS don't know the mechanics, or is very effective, then they are first to be blamed and kicked.  Weaver, I will admit, seems like you need good piano fingers to play, and I feel like that would be bad to try to learn that effectively, when I don't even know the dungeon mechanics.
---
there's an lfg system that's split into multiple sections. 
---
Open world content, PvP, Fractals, Raids, Dungeons, etc.
---
In the section you're looking for, you have to either advertise what you're looking for and anyone looking at lfg can choose to join that one in particular, or you have to join an existing lfg. And then you have to actually meet up with your party in front of the dungeon
---
almost similar to my keybind to ele, I had to move some skills to revolve around my naga. I vaguely remember my playtime on tera since I really couldn't get into it, I do remember there was a a chain action tree after upgrading skills?
---
-sighs- sure but enough would have been reallocated resources. The point remains, the layoffs will have had an effect on the production strengths of the game, because of the way they have stated that the living world teams are set up.  
---
Hence my adding the following to my statement. 
---
&gt;and overall resources
---
Also, as for ever worked... Depends, during principle development of the core game they probably had a pretty hefty staff count. 
---
...you made a notebook out of your sylvari?
---
Brutal.
---
Oh Jesus really, is it efficient? Sounds like you’d be lucky to find someone 
---
What's going on behind the scenes is pretty clear, gem store income has been siphoned off for other, cash negative, side projects instead of being invested into gw2
---
This game, even considering been a 6,5 years old game, have DEFINATELY, DEFINATELY, a better community OVERALL than League of legends, fortnight, Diablo 3, Terra online, runescape, WOW.
---
Dunno about other games, but for a MMRPG, you cannot expect better than this.
---
What I, however, consider true is the "pugs in raids" + "high levelfractal with pugs" + high rank pvp games: there are toxic players there, a lot more than, lets say in 2016.
---
But if you avoid pugs and stick to friends/guilds squads/parties, you can avoid it.
---
is it worth it to convert t5 to t6 mats before selling? 
---
We killed ourselves in gw2. They're all who's left.
---
Making a profit doesn't mean that it makes the parent company happy dude. 
---
Nor does all of that money get put back into the budget by NCsoft :P 
---
It isn't collapsing under being finanically unviable, but NCsoft have certainly decided that it is financially unpalatable currently. 
---
Planned was the companion app.
---
Dreaming an Orders of Tyria app would be cool, sending squads of yout characters orders around collecting stuff that grants character bound rewards or currencies (eg. send them into a dungeon for tokens or stuff) or map reward progression and rewards.
---
Does that make the commander the mobile games market?
---
“Well you *are* a phone, aren’t you?”  
---
What are kitty benchmarks?
---
Yeah guys, ignore those who say the game is dying. It's not like we get a total of 10 hours of content a year. But the game is still alive and kicking! And with the confirmation that after LW4 there'll be LW5 instead of an Expansion, the game is surely to flourish even more!
---
isn't that number meant to represent the total employees and not just the gw2 dev team?
---
I have a quick question! Do the subgroups need to remain the exact same or can we change the placement of the classes for the sake of boon/buff priority? For example, could we place one core necro in each subgroup?
---
I have no clue about what you are trying to say
---
Welcome to Gaming Media my man.

LS3 didn't feel nearly as coherent as LS4 has (so far), both narratively and in terms of geography/build up of story.
---
The switch between the White Mantle, Primordus &amp; _other_ arcs feels jarring, especially on replays with alts. 
---
1. Bitterfrost Frontier to show 'altered' dragon minions (this would also allow braham's arc to be less angsty, where he goes up north to find out more data) 
---
2. White Mantle Arc (BsF followed by LD)
---
3. Primordus Arc (Ember Bay + Draconis Mom's)
---
4. Siren's Landing, (Sylvari Closure)
---
This, this and more this. Welcome to how actual business works people.
---
sadly im eu, but i can always try NA and check my ping over there
---
Let me fix that: Not ***what remains of*** the GW2 nor GW1 teams.
---
The devs working on these other projects are devs that GW2 has sorely needed. Anyone denying that ArenaNet's release cadence for GW2 has fallen far short of expectations for a competent game development studio frankly has no notion of what competence means. If GW2 has any future apart from a slow death spiral, it needs an infusion of talent and dedication rather than for the status quo to persist.
---
I have some bad news....
---
their mobile division is sound. It made almost twice as much revenue as their MMOs combine. You can bet investors and shareholders will bring that up.
---
Doubtful, as a company Arenanet has only published 2 games in 19 years. They werent "going rogue." They we working on some unannounced titles/ projects. Just the projects either were taking too long or eating up too many resources and need to be culled. Gw2 updates have been scarce because the company has been funnelling it's work force towards those unannounced projects. With NCSoft cancelling those titles and starting layoffs, we may see more devs get shifted back to GW2, more likely however, people will just get laid off and GW2 will get put into maintenance mode. 
---
and now we can definitely forget about Cantha
---
Whomever designed the Choya is probably a parent with a few toddlers.
---
That's what I am saying tho, it's not a counter point. It fits in with what I was saying completely.
---
I see! I agree with your point that mounts will have very little impact at choke points. Essentially I'm talking about getting through a zerg to reach the backline or pushing through a choke. You don't need to Shadow Return to push through. As long as you have a teleport skill with an instant cast like Shadowstep or Blink, or an invulnerability skill like Mist Form or Renewed Focus, or a combination of stances like Balanced Stance/Berserker Stance/Endure Pain, then you can easily push into a choke without taking damage, or at most, very little. 
---
They are most likely gonna get laid off and GW2 will suffer for it. No matter how it's spun, this is bad news for the company. NCSoft isn't gonna just shuffle them back to GW2. 
---
Gacha is RNG boxes that the mmo community is afraid of because it is associated with pay2win games.
---
Honkai impact uses gacha so you get stronger anime girls by spending money to  progress in the game.
---
You don't need to do damage or be focused. Tempest is the only class capable of aura sharing outside of combo fields and that alone makes it viable. It also has by far the most condi cleanse of any support, and Shocking Aura and Magnetic Aura counter Mirage really hard.
---
I'd only rate Tempest a tad bit lower than Firebrand. The longer the fight, the better it is for Tempest.
---
&gt;none of those side projects have value
---
Well, none of those who were cut off. We have not been told that they do not have any other project left have we? If ArenaNet is not working on their next game(s), they are out of business in a few years anyway (and both GW and GW2 cease to exist).
---
Starting and abandoning projects is a common -and necessary- practice, though the parent company stepping in and laying off people left and right is not common place.
---
I am going to guess they were trying to make another e-sports game and NCSoft facepalmed and said no.
---
I think they were asking if it exists a rotation that uses the 5 key, and there is...its called pugging world bosses on ele and you wanna tag the mobs.
---
The rest of staff ele's rotation is based in placement, particularly you need to learn when and where you need to drop your immobile skills. That being said, staff ele has been pretty good dps for large targets since the beginning of the game.
---
We had a pro league?
---
Insert pikachuface.jpg
---
Apperantly no devs from gw2 got laid off only devs from unannounced projects.
---
The feeling is mutual!
---
Its been a long while, but I've always wondered something since we last played: 
---
if you are able to answer, which maps since release have you primarily designed that you were most proud of and why? Always good to put a name to the stunning work we run around in!
---
/r/TrahearneJokes 
---
I would say people worrying about their job status as well as the friends they have gained in the company might not be in the mood to stream. They have bigger things to worry about.
---
I prefer to be optimistic but I assume that they decided the side projects were starting to hurt the productivity of gw2 and had to decide to axe them.
---
Yeah and? Those quotes are irrelevant to what I initially said; the point was the CEO's message.
---
You rely heavily on your teammates to win team fights and in solo queue that doesn't go well most of the time. You are just a support that can't 1vs1 anything. 
---
I agree with you, but are there any game companies of significance left who aren't like this?
---
they still have a company to run, if stream is canceled just let us know. seriously.
---
It takes very little time to say "Understandably given the circumstances, this week's stream has been delayed/cancelled." Cancelling an event is one thing, but also public support *for* those impacted by the layoffs would probably win them some points.
---
I don't see that on their Twitter, or Facebook page. Another missed PR opportunity.
---
I don’t think it’s disrespectful to ask about a stream they said would happen that isn’t with no word of it being postponed... it’s understandable if it is but they should be communicating, especially considering the circumstances
---
I think at this point gw3 needs to be a thing. There is so much neglect and half assed releases. Plus as a semi new player, the content is so big and nobody is out playing in it. It feels like a single player mmo. 
---
Fuck gw2. They banned 1600 of us for almost no reason . How the mighty have fallen.  chris clearly i hope your fired first. You killed the game by those ban waves and illegally probed our computers. 
---
Maybe you should try r/guildrecruitment
---
There's a pretty fine line between splitting profits between your current game and other projects and moving so many resources off of a game that you have to tell your developers to make it look like they're not understaffed. One is normal game development, the other is pretty dishonest. 
---
I mean honestly... if they were laying of GW2 people do you think they would tell us?  That would signal it is a dead game and people would stop playing/buying and cost them revenue.  This statement means nothing IMO.  And best believe that all of those people laid off will be signing an NDA of some sort that ties their severance to keeping their mouths shut... so even if they do lay off some GW2 staff we will never hear about it.
---
I literally have nothing but respect for the people. And i think it's awful what happened, but everyone that got laid off wasn't part of the gw2 section. The least they could do is make a tweet. 
---
Sure, but at the same time does it mean they can't forum post or tweet out that they cancelled today's stream? Do you think it helps the situation of spiraling uncertainty when we get radio silence on something that was scheduled and postponed once already?
---
It was a PvP tournament style thing that MightyTeapot did where he had this tool that assembled random batshit builds with no real rationale behind them; random weapons, sigils/runes, traits and players would participate in a 1v1(?) tournament and duke it out.   The similarity here seems to be random classes (Core, HoT + PoF) all mixed together for competitive speedkills whereas mystic builds was even more sad and random ='P.  This tournament is about making due w/ the best composition for a given week. 
---
Check out the "Side Stories" section here:
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Achievement#Categories
---
There are a lot of mini "quests" built into the achievement system that reward ascended gear. Another set I love are the Specialization Collections. If you have the Xpacs, there is a whoooole lot you can do to work towards completing those collection.
---
Thread removed: Not relevant to Guild Wars 2.
---
Yeah I can see that they could potentially support the other game more but we don't know what's been going on from the pressure of their publisher, etc.
---
Perfect! Thank you!
---
Must be another snowstorm I guess lmao
---
Here’s the thing: living story COULD have been used to deliver all those things. 
---
New race could have been introduced with the Kodak when we went to winterwhateverland. 
---
New specialisations could’ve been added like when Marjory got her greatsword she could have in the next episode start training necromancers to be reapers. 
---
New large maps could be added similar to dry top.
---
The issue isn’t that the LS couldn’t introduce that material it’s that it didn’t try to. 
---
The LS started with almost nothing, just story and small events. Then they started adding bigger events, instanced content, actually changing the maps, adding new maps, etc. But they never added weapons or classes or etc. Even when they had the chance. 
---
Holosmith could have been gadgets developed by Taimi after studying Scarlet’s hologram weapons. Deadeye could have been learned from the pale reavers. Tempest could have been learned from the Exalted or maybe Malyk’s tree has Tempests who could have taught us their ways. All the PoF ones have people out in the desert with their own story they could have used as people added to train us as well. They’ve clearly tied some specialisations to the story, and had certain progress blocked in maps in HoT where you needed masteries to unlock progress further. So it’s not like that couldn’t work they just weren’t devoting resources to something to replace an expansion, they were just hoping what they were doing was enough and it clearly wasn’t. 
---
Sorry this was ramble I’m typing between driving. 
---
Polymock with the Minis you earned ingame and bought for Gems. As a mobile gw2 extension but also mobile standalone. 
---
no cancelled plans kappa
---
GW1 isn't producing much money either by the looks of it
---
Need to point the fingers as to exactly why it's failing. We don't want people blaming GW2's failure upon the lack of gear treadmills.
---
yeah i saw the dev response earlier, seems like it acutally is a thing, sadly
---
u/Pensive_but_charming seconding RiT. They have excellent trainers and a helpful community.
---
NCsoft pulling the plug on those ideas gives a pretty good clue as to their quality
---
ehmm no. they made gw2 becuase there were too much limitations in gw1
---
Hopefully they will lay off the forum admins that endlessly censor players opinions.
---
I'm not worried about the devs. I'm worried about NCSoft.
---
They don't owe me anything. I'd like to see the game continue and that clearly isn't going to happen if the money is being flushed on bad ideas.
---
The people that clear all the raid wings every week spend more time on the game and are more inclined to purchase gems.  the 5h a week player has a much smaller investment into the game and isn't as likely to buy gems.
---
Because I want the items I spent money on to get? I doubt many are sitting around thinking deeper then "hmm I like that item". You know? like normal things in life that you like with a price tag. 
---
Also you must be new to development, or companies in general if any of this is surprising to you. 
---

Are you sure they didn't get to keep some of these 'unannounced projects' that could still prove lucrative?
---
'cancellation of unannounced projects' is ambiguous in that regard.
---
I'm mostly focused on the environmental variety of LS3 compared to LS4.  I almost never replay the personal story.  In that regard it's very much once and done for me as I don't actively pursue achievements either.  LS4 has almost been exclusively self-contained within Elona and the Crystal Desert -- sand, sand and *more* sand.  I felt like the maps were starting to blurr into each other.  I loved traveling the world because it felt like our adventure was a global cause to rally behind.
---
I'll agree that LS3 jumped around a lot, but I think because of that I was more excited about where we were going.  With LS4 I've pretty much just stopped looking forward to where we're going because it's pretty ironed in that LS4 takes place in the Crystal Desert &amp; Elona and while that establishes continuity and fluid plot-progression it isn't without its drawbacks.  For a lot of the earlier releases LS4 felt very much like, "Sand, sand and *more* sand," and I've lost interest unfortunately.  
---
The game is already dead bro-
---
100% agree, though i will not be buying gems until anet can show they're investing resources back into gw2. I'm not interested in funding a mobile game
---
there was not normal stream yesterday and seems like no special stream today either
---
Well up until 2018 they used to release 2 raids a year too. Only in 2018 they got delayed for some reason. 
---
My point is that Anet isn't that different with releases from other mmos, the content quantity they release is about the same, but everyone always speaks as if they release close to nothing which is complete bullshit.
---
&gt; The difficult content in GW2 for the same audience are CMs which aren't even worth repeating.
---
At least you have hard content aside from raids...
---
Explain lol. I can fix it if I need to
---
Knock that shit off. 
---
People like Rubi or whoever runs audio / video for the stream are not on the GW2 team per se. It is certainly possible vital people are effected.
---
A tweet would be nice, sure, but it is no surprise for the stream not to go as planned.
---
Good point, i guess time will tell when layoff stories start coming out
---
You savage!
---
Rest of?
---
If you name what you'd like I can make them
---
&gt;al players - yet it goes on.
---
It also releases four difficulty modes (One of which is accessible to casuals) of a 8-12 boss raid along with it, new non-cash shop mounts, transmogs, often a new dungeon... 
---
\&gt; Its essentially 1-2 hours of content too after you learn the fights. 
---
Unless you're a top 500 guild, 'learning the fights' takes 4 of those 6 months. Only \~1.5-3% of the playerbase clear a raid tier on mythic difficulty, before the next one is released.
---
Found it.  It was this one.

---
There's still a job to be done. That's called being professional.
---
The show must go on.
---
WoW releases new exapc every 2 years keeping player base hyped. 
---
Ranger Pet Skills also did not require you to stand still, so they were the perfect pvp kiting tools in a game that forces others to stand still.
---
That would have actually been awesome. If each living story season introduced one or two new elite specializations. Instead of the meta being stale for years, and being completely turned over by an expansion release, and then another period of staleness... Introduce 1 or 2 new elite specs every 3 months.
---
Are they going to be perfectly balanced? No. Are they going to pull people back, to try them out, piecemeal? Yes.
---
XD,ye im sure employes got this info from gw2 reedit. my god. brain? HELOOOOOOOOOO
---
Why would resources be diverted back to GW2? Its more likely those who were moved will be terminated.
---
The important thing is that the owners get a return on their investment. However that happens is up to management. It's definitely a good idea to listen to the playerbase to understand how best to grow and monetize the game.
---
Game's been dying for a while. It's *not* on a positive trajectory in any way. Sure, NCSoft isn't going anywhere, but if its investment in ANet is not as lucrative as elsewhere, to say nothing of GW2, then GW2 will be killed even faster.
---
Good idea. Tactically speaking, running around taking enemy structures forces other teams to defend/retake those structures, which can put the pressure off your team's zergs. 
---
Not tactically speaking: it's the easiest way to get participation/pips/wxp. One of those things will get people Warclaw.
---
As comm, you should be laying siege. Also, communicate where you're going/what you're doing. Even something quick, like pinging a tower you're enroute to
---
Yep they are. I think I said in another post that GW2 relies on lootboxes and literal gambling now.
---
I've had a look at all the comments, but still no luck. I give up. I ain't downloading the entire thing just to work through registration for 30 minutes.
---
Christ, how does this even happen in 2019.
---
Sign up, oh you have a GW1 account? Link it. Wanna pay to play? No? Just free? No worries, just know you won't get x, y, or z. Happy? Ok then, log in.
---
Nope. Error, error, go here, click that (it's not there). Some more errors. Try resetting password. Nah, that didn't work. Repeat ad nauseum.
---
Thanks for your help guys, but I'm outta here. Maybe in a year or so I'll have forgotten about this experience and I'll try again. Too salty to get any more wound up about this right now.
---
I get what you're saying, but we the public don't know what happened. Good ideas or bad ideas, we don't know what they were working on at all. NCSoft has a history of flushing non-performing properties, it's just math to them. There's a lot of upset in this sub about "whoever came up with these bad ideas to develop", but we don't *know* what those things were. So how can we judge if someone at Anet screwed up, vs the axe man from NCSoft with the directive to trim any fat they could find?
---
I like how people are up-voting someone who can't even edit their post. "[Oof, my bad,] wrong link"
---
Well I agree with that, but it doesn't mean she still wouldn't be legitimately angry at the company. 
---
Oh gosh I LOVE his work! I ran across a great YouTube video he did of a beautiful sketchbook he’d made with a built in pencil case. It was so cool! 
---
Rubi is actually on holiday currently. But she is part of the gw2 team. The media department i believe
---
Unless of course the pr people are part of it, no need to create drama where it need not be. 
---
Incredible work!  Thanks for sharing this!  I feel like this is a good time to say that the original FDS bonus item could use an update.  The Path of Fire Sohothin model and your model look waaaay better.
---
u/GaileGray , She is so sweet. I am fill with joy every time I see something from her... since GW1. 
---
All my thoughts are with you and everyone at Anet.
---
I upvoted you back to 0 points, it's refreshing seeing someone that understands that blaming capitalism at every single opportunity they can is stupid.
---
It really looks like the stream won't be happening any time soon. I for one am disappointed about the lack of communication. 
---
Thats not how I define hyperbole.
---
Let's see, last time i checked $600 pc (including OS, keyboard mouse etc) was enough to be on-par with consoles. PS4 was $400 Xbox1 was $350. So far it is more expensive.
---
Then when you add up the yearly payments to be online, they become a tiny bit more expensive over the span of 4-5 years.
---
Then most people that own a console still need some sort of laptop or PC to do other stuff that you cannot do on a console. Even a very cheap one adds up to the price.
---
Then you get to upgrades. Right now Consoles are a tiny bit more expensive + you still spend some more on a PC or laptop for various reasons. Then you have to change your console after 5 years let's assume. Doubling the price. Upgrading your current PC however is much cheaper to keep up with the new consoles.
---
Second parts are much easier to find for PC but i'll ignore this part since some ppl have trust issues.
---
Console games are a lot more pricey too in general. Look at overwatch for example. 
---
Console *is* a bit cheaper if you look at it from a perspective of buy and bench it vs doing same on pc. The moment you actually use it and think about a general use / lifespan / replacements it is just so much more expensive.
---
Before you think i dislike consoles, if i had the money i'd buy all the consoles too. But if you have money for just one, PC &gt; console for sure.
---
It’s surprising how many companies do this and don’t understand that most people would be so much more satisfied if you just took one minute to let them know what’s up.
---
WHY AM I JUST LEARNING ABOUT THIS NOW ANET?!
---
resources as in money. Money that was previously being funneled to a project they have decided to cancel.
---
&gt; And today, they released a roadmap talking about the future releases of the game for the year 2019.
---
ANet did that once or twice as well and yet look as where we are at now.
---
Also it sounds more like FO76 is attempting to do something not that they have successfully done something. Huge difference.
---
Shit I wish every game company gave away free content every 3 months for 3 years after buying their game. 
---
Imagine if Halo, Red Dead Redemption, GTA and Final Fantasy added a new story chapter every 3 months for 3 years without having to buy a season pass or an expansion 
---
Outside the joke, but can't complain is a Nokia and the phone already survived way too many things it will break a iphone or galaxy o.Ou
---
&gt; What in there says he doubts the game will continue past season 5?
---
What are you on about? He clearly says he has doubts about the game after S5, its black and white.
---
&gt; Doesn't sound all that positive and reassuring to me
---
"We're bleeding money and talent, future is uncertain, but please don't leave!"
---
Huh... colour is not the only spectrum choya are on.
---
I have to say that I am quite a bit disheartened by the statement in that article where apparently Anet was siphoning dev effort from Guildwars into other things. 
---
It’s hard evidence to the long stated suspicions in the player base that WVW and PVP just aren’t a priority. 
---
Anet, some of us have spent a lot of money on this game. You need to make this right. 
---
I want to hear the plan for WVW for the next three years. 
---
If Ubuntu can track all their development in the complicated literations of an entire operating system publicly, you owe us a plan for WvW. 
---
I want a roadmap.
---
Ahh. iOS only 😕
---
Cancelling it is perfectly understandable, keeping everyone in the dark is only going to make everything worse.
---
80 million a year isn't exactly bad...
---
Disappointed yet again heh
---
Ls3 had ascended accessories which made it must play even for wvw'ers
---
Most of the "gaming press" is corrupt as hell, and gives scores based on handouts.
---
The goal is to get people in, raise participation, keep them busy and out of the way and then get them out if they want to. 
---
I've started my plans for purple siege stuff and I'm doing my homework on how it works. 
---
**I** want the Warclaw, and I have a commander tag and am not afraid to use it (and I'm not a silent "mobile dorito" commander). 
---
What hard content aside from CM raids? Anet is very different with releases, especially compared with teams of "similar", at face value, sizes like Blizzard. The comparisons to FFXIV I always find a little shaky when we know that Anet was supposed to be closer in size to the Blizzard team working on WoW. Though we are now quite aware that resources weren't being used on GW2.
---
I've raided in GW2 since Spirit Vale release. I love the game. But pretending the instanced PvE release schedule is on par with FFXIV, never mind WoW, is quite ridiculous. Since 2015 we've had 18 raid bosses and 6 new fractals, only two of which have repeatable hard modes. Raids have no easier difficulty. That isn't great and leaving player retention on endlessly farming Istan or Silverwastes or HoT metas isn't going to hold players.
---
The other problem is that Anet, even with their reduced resources, completely waste them. Blizzard worked out a long time ago that easier difficulties meant that raids could be used for major story points and give worth to the time spent on that repeatable content. Instead Anet throw out 2 hour story patches every 3 months (at best) with instanced content, with unique music and voice acting, that is barely revisited. So while the amount of content packaged into a release might seem similar to other MMOs, it isn't replayable content; as shown by the number of people that see this as a second MMO to play only with story patches. 
---
Fallout 76 is the worst example. They did not turn around nothing, the game if we can call it that, it is shitfest, still bugged and contentless.
---
i don't need a cost analysis from you. you get to make your choices with your money, and i get to do the same with mine.
---
having a console gives me access to that console's exclusives. no amount of PCMR shenanigans will ever be able to beat it.
---
also:
---
&gt; Let's see, last time i checked $600-700 pc (including OS, keyboard mouse etc) was enough to be on-par with consoles. PS4 was $400 Xbox1 was $350. So far it is more expensive.
---
$700 will get me a console, a cheap phone, and a cheap laptop. that seems to be the optimal choice given the budget.
---
No Armors here
---
Dead game
---
I've led farms, metas and zergs in PvE, so morale is definitely a part of it. In unfamiliar territory people rage quit quite readily (HoT metas people are chill about but in PoF people will quit if anything goes wrong because they're less familiar).
---
I never played the game 
---
Yeah naw I know mainly memes, last time I checked core necro was like 22-23k ish. Death Magic buffs help quite a bit.
---
I really hope not. I want Cantha so badly. ;-;
---
Why do you think the colors of the Consortium are blue and yellow?
---
lol i searched Fallout 4. derp.
---
Thanks for the correction, I'll delete my post now.
---
&gt;no amount of PCMR shenanigans
---
Did i sound like that? I did say if i had the money i'd buy all the consoles too.
---
To me you sound more like a "console MR" don't project it on to me. You simply said something that is factually wrong and i fixed it.
---
Console is cheaper as a product, it is not cheaper to in reality when it comes to usage. I like how you ignored most of my post and only quote a single part. Shows where you are coming from.
---
Your money, your choices. Don't get offended when ppl call you out on your bullshit in public though. This is a public forum, and you decided to spread bullshit such as:
---
&gt;In terms of value for money, consoles are pretty hard to beat.
---
You are wrong, as i said up. For anyone else that comes across this post, they'll know you were wrong and that is the point of my reply. You do you. o/
---
Warframe and PoE devs dont mind giving players roadmap with stuff to be done in next year or so.
---
Soo.. why dont you, Anet?
---
&gt; can we just get a megathread for this topic? i feel like many people are just using this as an opportunity for easy karma.
---
I just didn't want r/mmorpg to have another reason to shit on our game :/
---
The guy who was gonna run he stream got let go an hour before. 
---
This is more like netflix taking your money, adding a bollywood movie every 3 mos, and spending the remainder on an unknown and apparently unprofitable piece of concept art.
---
&gt; GW2 has continued to be profitable.
---
NCSoft has a reputation for killing profitable games, lol. People aren't missing the memo, you just aren't really seeing why people are nervous.
---
This very company has done exactly what people are afraid of before.
---
The best way to catch Vinetooth Prime is to show up for the octovine meta and advertise in map chat while people are looting chests. That gives you a large audience and plenty of time to form up before the map resets. Then start working on the Eastwatch event chain and hope everyone knows how to CC.
---
Crimson wurm???
---
You should aim to do meta events at prime time. That's when folks are free from work or other responsibilities. Depends where you live and which server you are playing in. 
---
Also look for LFG. People still actively look for people for events.
---
but anyway you got 45 people on east as everytime
---
And Arena Net might very well do so, but my god give them a break, it was just hours ago this happen. Fallout 76 have been a thing for months and months, and they certainly did not fix this on the same day a few hours later. People need to understand that real life is not a click on a pc it is real things, give it some time at least.
---
not really. there are a couple of good no-kit builds ([Nike's latest open world build vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnl-nI-cZXo) for example). for absolute max raid DPS they recommend grenade and bomb kits obviously, but i usually stick with just grenades or swap out for holo utilities in open world. i usually play rifle for burst/CC but sword/shield or sword/pistol are totally viable.
---
I agree with this sentiment, but not even a statement that it was cancelled looks really really bad. 
---
We all talk too much with too little information. Which is the main point we should be talking about: The lack of information.
---
I hope you don't get fired man... Sending love to everyone that'll be affected at ArenaNet.
---
It _is_ snowing here, funny enough. Just flurries, shouldn't stick [around for long] as it is low to mid 40s today.
---
They will stil get paid to do a job until an official notice. And even then its not a case of gtfo. 
---
If i buy gems i buy it because i want something. I buy gems and get the thing i want, mission done. If you do not want to add money to a game then farm gold, get gems, buy what you want, mision done for you. 
---
This posts are ridiculous at this point. Stop causing panic over nothing you do not even know anything about yet how it will play out.
---
i doubt having special snowflake squads is gonna do much positive for outsiders. their experiences would be questionable, and they'd learn close to nothing about the mode and its community. also it makes it easier for trolls to target those squads specifically.
---
in the likely case that the warclaw is not much more than a wvw mastery, those with mild interest should try to some effort to fit in, while more experienced players should act according to the opportunity this provides.
---
those that simply want the mount and do not care about the mode itself, have a brilliant opportunity to breathe some new life into EotM, benefitting themselves, and showing consideration for the mode itself in the process.
---
they don't though, many of them recommended the game to people looking for what this game offers over other mmos in the never ending "what mmo should i play" posts. a lot of them have legitimate gripes with certain aspects of the game and decisions of anet, the fact that their opinions of the game are negative do not mean they are invalid. many of them are jaded, with good reason, mmos have been going downhill for a long time. the fact of the matter is, i often saw gw2 as one of the top mmos listed over there when people inevitably asked the same old question, it just isn't for everyone.
---
Mist websites are doing it, websites that didn't give a fuck about GW2 with literally zero news about the game or the expansions for years just capitalize this
---
I get that, but people will be coming in with little experience and it's a way to mitigate the damage they do to organised squads. 
---
PvE players will likely approach WvW like PvE, so organisation will help and I'm asking for volunteers who are willing to guide the newbies and teach them how it works. 
---
If you don't want to, that's fine. I'm just suggesting that one colour tag be set aside for a couple of weeks to organise people who are new and don't want to invest in different gear. After a week or so, it'll die down. 
---
Linking is as simple as registering a Gw2 account with the same username as your Gw1 account.
---
Festivals across servers are already planned!
---
He’ll do it, too. :( He jumps on my corpse instead of resing every time. 
---
Troll target.... What is wrong with you guys. It is WvW and PvP game mode. You are there to kill people. It is not trolling to kill people because it is PVP. Is everybody out of their minds here?
---
Aurenanet 
---
I think the point is WvW will be flooded with non-competitive players no matter what. It's inevitable, since the WvW mount can be used in PvE. The next few weeks could be a nightmare for competitive players.
---
?????
---
So if you find out you might/will be fired, you just stop working? Is that what you're saying? This stream isn't a hobby for them, and they aren't freelancers or self-employed either. This is a trainwreck. Please don't make up excuses for them, leave at least *this* part to them if they can't even manage to tweet "sorry, stream must be delayed".
---
i was more thinking about chat with that line.
---
Which is sort of odd since you can visit quite a few of their feeds and see them post hourly during the work day. Or atleast before the looming threat of lay offs.
---
No, the person is suggesting a tag set aside so that experienced players can carry on as normal and a training squad can be set up for people who are new. 
---
Ikr, these comments are like bizarro world. If anet thinks that way, no wonder they never get shit done.
---
In reality after the initial surprise not many people seem concerned about the situation. At least if we go by thread upvotes.
---
By GW2 community standard, it is hardly an outrage. More like a concerned discussion.
---
I mean, JP? Almost 10k. Mount adoption? 5k. Ban over being sent gold by a griefer? 4k. Lack of build templates? ArenaNet spyware? Concerns about HoT pre-purchase? More than 3k. All of these just counting the top thread.
---
This? About 1.5k after a whole day. Less than the trailers of recent episodes. And the community is far from consensual about how to feel about it.
---
ArenaNet is fine (community-wise). Besides, 2019 and 2020 have a rough roadmap of 'we will be releasing Season 5 at about the same pace as Season 4', which probably includes fractals at about the same rate. I would wager that it is the gist of what we'll get (maybe the WvW alliance overhaul and a few raid wings).
---
The issue is not that they won't give a roadmap, the issue is that many players want more that what they put on the roadmap and now we have a clue why.
---
 &gt; 
---
I literally have nothing but respect for the people. 
---
Honestly, I don't. You just don't do what they did. What exactly do you respect there? Certainly not their work ethics.
---
That is not what they're saying at all. They're saying to reserve the pink tag for pve scrubs who are trying wvw for the first time. A squad where the expectations are set waaaay lower for performance because they know they're a bunch of noobs.
---
It's not like they're asking for the tag to avoid all PvP or just hunt the champion mobs in EBG or something.
---
Your response is a great example of how jumpy some of the wvwers can be. fwiw, I'm about rank 1250 right now so maybe I'm not as hardcore as some but I've definitely put in my time (and no, it wasnt eotm grind from back in the day). We all know that this event is gonna bring in rally bots and make organized groups deal with noobs on their side. But it's not like we can complain that "wvw is a dying game mode" and at the same time tell anyone new and interested to try it out to get the fuck out.
---
ArenaNet should do like Yoshida and the devs of FFXIV do and have a strict update schedule and do "Letter from the Producer" type streams where they detail upcoming patches and what's in store in general for the future.
---
Well it is not me dying it is them. If they adjust to the game mode they will do great. They will get lots of karma, loot, pips and ranks. Or they can decide to not adjust and be dead for all their time inside WvW without gaining much of the above. Was done in the past with the legendary back pack. People not willing to adjust left fast enough since it too way to long for them to get the back pack.
---
So it sound like a you problem and not a me problem. 
---
It's difficult to find a game marketed worse than GW2, because ANet keep either tripping over their own feet, or putting them in their mouths.
---
They must have celebrated when Blizzard fucked itself into the dirt with Diablo Immortal.
---
Disappointed means you had expectations about communication? From anet?!
---
&gt; "there's no content in development"
---
This is what maintenance mode means.
---
Really well done. I love the texturing.
---
No doubt. These are the ultimate Sylvari weapons. Add this guy to the mix too:
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mawdrey
---
Aurenanet lmfao.
---
Ofc they are asking that why would they ask it otherwise? And them keeping spots from WvW players just by avoiding fights how is this a good thing for the server who have to deal with it? 
---
So i assume you are not a WvW player then? Because if there is a zerg on the border, and 20 people are at the jumping puzzled we will lack 20 peoples performance in the fights and most likely loose because of that. 
---
WvW is in a terrible shape already so do you think this will help when the com ask for players to join up and realise how many there are missing and we start to loose fights, structures and the like because of it?
---
&gt; The next few weeks could be a nightmare for competitive players.
---
That's the idea. I would like some fault-tolerant commanders to be okay to train people, at least until they get what they came for and go. 
---
Did we checked the same thread? Because most comment Ive read on that discussion were pretty much "Not optimal, but viable. If you pratice it a lot you can do it, static will probably dont mind if you are good pug might badly react".
---
The lesser known part about not putting all your eggs in one basket, though, is that if you keep them too spread out, you cannot keep them all warm, and thus alive.  This may be the case with Arenanet at this point.  
---
I don't recall too many people being overly happy with Arenanet at the times when information about their interest in mobile was touched on.  Doesn't mean everyone hated it, but I imagine that if Mike stood up on a stage and announced Guild Wars 3 and that it would be only available on mobile, the response would be about the same as it was when Blizzard announced the mobile Diablo at Blizcon (2018, if I recall?)  
---
And they adjust to the game mode, follow a comander if they do not want to roam, join ts have good fights, good loot, reward tracks and pips. But somehow you feel this will work. 
---
Question, if 5 wvw players join a 10 man raid and announce that their group is just gonna hang around and wait to tag the boss but keep away whilst those other 5 is doing the bosses to make sure they wont be effected by the 5 wvw players. Does this make sense to you?
---
Training squads, not snowflake squads. 
---
I've edited the post to make it clearer: if you are willing to train newbies, use a pink tag and the LFG. If not, carry on as normal. 
---
Exactly, no communication on Anet's behalf makes gamers feel anxious
---
... are you okay dude? Where did anyone mention the jp or any other pve aspect of wvw?
---
Looks pretty, but you should try and take a better photo or scan, the quality kinda ruined your work.
---
I agree, it's just that I thought that if EVEN FO76 did it, Anet should be doing it also
---
A while back a set of builds ranging from off-meta to very off meta, done by a single individual who calls themselves Kitty and called their builds &amp; numbers Kitty Benchmarks.
---
People who believe in min-maxing (and do the min-max effort) pointed out quite a few flaws in a number of these builds even down to the rotations.  So they were never taken seriously by players who enjoy the meta.
---
My comment was a sort of throwback mention/joke since by definition off-meta builds will be required for such a contest depending on the RNG selection of the month.
---
The delay was announced during official WvW stream. I don't know what more do you want. Begging for your forgiveness?
---
Should have picked a better example like FFXIV, PoE or Warframe like others said
---
&gt; I like how you ignored most of my post and only quote a single part. Shows where you are coming from. 400 + 4 years of $60 payments is already $640. Cheap phone and laptop for $60 okay first hand? Sure, although the OS itself will push it to $700 so there goes your logic.
---
and yet, you are including a service fee paid out in parts as upfront cost. not to mention: it's an optional service fee. you don't have to pay it if you have no intention of playing online.
---
you can easily buy laptops for $300 from places like costco. OS included. they also sell cheap phones for $100. catch them on sale, and you can easily fit both and a console for $700.
---
so no, i am not wrong.
---
&gt; To me you sound more like a "console MR" don't project it on to me. You simply said something that is factually wrong and i fixed it.
---
sounds like you're the one projecting. as for me being "factually wrong"? no, not really. you did a cost analysis for a given budget for yourself given your circumstances, and i did the same for me. not surprisingly, we came to difference conclusions. that doesn't make me any less right than you.
---
you do you o/
---
It is good to avoid the question. How do you think a comander without a big plile of people are able to defend or fight another enemy comander? 
---
Can i join your fractal group with a few firends and sit around the spawn area and just tag the bosses for loot. I don't want to be in the way nor do i want to adjust to any PvE like so i will do this thing to make sure you wont be effected by sitting around spawn until you are about to kill the boss. Good deal for you?
---
When will people learn! They botched the announcement of an announcement for goodness sake. Communication incompetence needs to become the expectation from ANET.
---
A few month ago decorations were added like parts for building a racing track. Also all seats were made made interactable, not guild hall specific but also effects those decorations.
---
But I don't expect major update there
---
As opposed to figuratively? 
---
No chance you simply expressed yourself badly I guess. No of course not.
---
It's not uncommon for a game company to put all the eggs in one basket
---
You speak like every gw2 player reads reddit or news. Most players dont even know any of this happened
---
I just wanted mobile Polymock. :'(
---
I wish you will never be in the position of sudden job loss. Godspeed random reddit user
---
yes it was said a WEEK after it was announced, the delay was "announced" on the next stream when the cause of the delay was days before that (and yes I get that delays happen, just a little heads up would avoid most of the PR nightmares Anet is getting themselves in lately) I feel bad in a way for the devs that had to deal with people there that were expecting an announcement when there was not one to be had. Again, one single sentence on a twitter post from the gw2 account on it saying it's delayed and it would have been the end of it. When you have a business its a VERY bad idea to just leave your customers in the dark and just assume they'll know all they should be.
---
I realize that within any PR and decision making process, especially large things like that, at some point go through the big boss man.  It does at every single company.  
---
You could possibly argue that it wasn't O'Brien on that specific moment, but quite often they release information then wait an \*incredibly\* long time to implement what they've announced.  It basically kills all hype for the actual implementation of it, and severely hurts PR across the board.  Look at Apex, for example.  Its a completely different game, but they had little/no announcements, and dropped it on live.  WoW does the same thing: Keep it close to your chest until you're sure of its date/time, and then create the hype.  Warhammer 40k does the same thing with slow building information 21-14 days before the release.  
---
No. I checked it before and they removed "Warcraw" from the title. 
---
This is probably very hard news to take in. It is for me at least
---
Yes but those players are casuals which play gw2 only because its f2p. They usually dont pay for this game and dont support it. Real fans are most important because they pay arenanet to let them live. 
---
Are you new to wvw? There are a bunch of commanders who tag up privately with their guilds and lock squad invites / ignore team and nap chat. There are also pugmanders who don't worry at all about squad composition and just run with whoever joins them. The OP is asking for pugmanders to sport a certain color to make it easier for noobs to find a group that is more accepting of them.
---
Look dude, I get it. You have a deep shame over how you used to just farm the JP and centaur events. That deep shame of yours has manifested now that you see more new players are coming in and you so desperately want to help them avoid the mistakes you made. It's a valiant effort, but you're going about it all wrong! They didn't even know there was a JP to farm until you told them!
---
Op should try it then
---
I don't disagree with you. But to a lot of people it will feel wrong, if they're expecting an MMO which it's not. 
---
How the fuck are you confusing empathy with an individual with understanding of the corporate decisions where said individual works? Sorry, but you guys aren't the brightest, typical for this community and a reason why we're in this shit with zero communication and anet not being hold accountable by anyone.
---
This is so stupid it physically hurts. 
---
It has been less than 24 hours since it happened. 
---
They said "GAME SERVICES" would be unaffected. Not "Our staff will not be affected by these changes". Last time I checked, a Stream on Twitch isn't a GW2 Game service, nor does it have anything to do with GW2 continued up-time. 
---
You guys are far too literal and god forbid any of you experience what they are when you have a family and bills to pay.
---
I think ArenaNet is partly at fault for this.  Game sites use popular content, and ANets PR is pretty horrible most of the time.  There's no hype behind the game, so there's no reason for them to talk about that hype that they themselves kill.  Living world? Wait a while, you'll get it piece meal.  Legendary armor?  here's an announcement, now, next year you'll see it in part of the game.  WvW restructure?  Pending, 14 months ago it was announced IIRC.  
---
However: A game laying off employees is big news.  It creates buzz from other players looking to bring in new blood, sometimes leads to announcements, but certainly leads to drama.  
---
LOL
---
meme's are usually funny, that wasn't.
---
No, share prices, at any given moment, are presumed to have priced in all expected future earnings, no matter how high. So the investors who buy at a zillion are no dumber than those who buy at any other price. However, the point is that management can only deliver raise the price further by raising expectations even higher. Thus, even extreme profitability isn't enough.
---
Yeah, Jahai Bluffs. 
---
It took me a few days only to complete the Requiem armor and I still have other achievements left. Definitely way more than 6 hours. 
---
Also I did several different events, not only meta, and surprise, I never was alone at any event. Actually there were quite many players.
---
Everything you said is just completely different from what I experienced. 
---
But take another example, Sirens Landing. It's the same there, even though it's an old map compared to Jahai. And still you find a good amount of active players there doing not only the meta, but also other events. Well, there are also afk farmers, but I talk about active players.
---
it depends which scale you use if it the short or long scale.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_and_short_scales
---
You're crying over a fucking Twitch stream. You are showcasing zero empathy and demanding your petty little preview of a mount. Get over it.
---
&gt;I feel like the gameplay and story system are unique enough to not worry about losing out to competition
---
Yep, the gameplay and story of GW2's LS episodes are "unique" enough to not lose out against a FINAL FANTASY XIV EXPANSION.  
---
:/ Come on now.
---
I think a better example its Battlefront 2. The game was a bullshit because of the lootboxes problem at the beggining. But the Devs understand the problem, and made a good game after some patches. They presented a roadmap.   
---
Other good example was Wow when Legion was launched. WoD sucks, but the problema was the silent of the devs, then the devs start showing legion, they presented the roadmap, etc. Then it came BFA and the devs took the position of gods.. 
---
Forgot to ask, can you only do it on a char that’s completed the last mission? Or can I transfer the broken Caledbolg to any char and still do it?
---
I'm not saying they should exist in a bubble, but a patient commander who can take the time to explain how supple etc works working in tandem with, but separate from, a squad of more experienced players. 
---
You seem to think I'm trying to ruin WvW by my incredible powers of stupidity... I'm asking people who are okay with training newbies to be really open and organised about if for a few weeks to make sure this isn't a total shitshow. Maybe I phrased it poorly, but I'm honestly trying to get the two communities to not piss each other off too much. 
---
The LFG is used _never_ in WvW and _all the time_ in PvE. If you've got PvE players coming in, it makes sense to get their attention using a way they're used to and then train them up in WvW with a commander who doesn't just give a discord link and then run off. Obviously say "join the discord if you want to carry on with WvW". People need to know that siege and supply are important and some commanders don't have time for that, I get it. Which is why I'm asking for people who *do* have time to help smoothe it out. 
---
I'm sorry but are you sure it would of been there? That streaming schedule would of been posted before the new mount was announced so I wouldnt expect it to be listed here [here](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/the-arenanet-streaming-schedule-for-the-week-of-february-18/)
---
Imagine getting that mad about video games whilst real people are actually fighting existential crisis. Jaw asked for consideration. Not empathy. Nice ad hominem btw
---
The actual announcement was done on a blogpost, not on stream. The announcement of the announcement was just a teaser (could even have been a slip up and just had to roll with it) AGAIN, keeping people in the dark, they WILL assume stuff that they wouldn't be in the first place if they were told. (and get more angry about it)
---
We'll win, we have to win!
---
...right?
---
I mean she'll totally come back in the next episode, right?
---
AHAHAHAahahahahaa ha
---
They also said " We're sorry that we didn't update you before "
---
Sorry if i had to blur the names on twitch chat i just wanted to share this asap.
---
I don't think there will be any other conversations by Anet himself on their twitch chat. I suggest everyone to calm your [s.ht](https://s.ht) down and keep doing whatever you do in your life/game. It's so annoying to see people come over and say something like "boooooo we were waiting for fcking 3 hours what's wrong with them". You don't know what's going on inside the company and probably most of the employees are in anxiety to lose their jobs. 
---
It's amazing how many of those people continue to spend time saying that, even today.
---
not really a surprise in the current situation :/
---
Considering some of the stress that many of them are having to deal with right now I'm impressed that they got the information out at all. Having faced the uncertainty of pending layoffs myself in my work life I hope everybody comes through this as well as can be expected and that anybody that is impacted is able to find work quickly.
---
That's the best possible outcome from this for GW2, but for Arenanet as a company that would be dangerous long term. Assuming both of the other projects have been canceled, if everyone who isn't let go works on GW2 that means the company is putting all its eggs in one basket. It is usually healthy for a games company to have at least one title in production in the background.
---
Well this is sad. I hope everyone is ok over there. Can't imagine what they go through these days. 
---
I'm having the same problem. Was hoping someone would post about it!
---
im currently calling my ISP to check if it is a local issue anyways, been having too many issues the last week on my CM runs, dying is painful!
---
Lay offs that's what happening. 
---
I mean, 3 xpacs isn't too shabby before it goes out. I would be playing this game in a decade still if they were still making content, but 6+ years is a long time for most games of any kind, MMOs included. 
---
Its just disappointing that 400 employee company can't even answer our question+ zero content produced after path of fire release 
---
Eve online is pretty cool
---
That's kind of a warped comparison, don't you think? Not only is Final Fantasy a *huge* international intellectual property (which blurs the lines on canon content a lot with collab projects like what they did with Monster Hunter and now with NieR), it's a subscription based game. If they stop putting out new stuff on a regular schedule, they lose regular subs.
---
GW2 is moreso competing with titles like ESO, Ashes of Creation, Crowfall, Bless online (lol), and the like.
---
I don't know any dev personaly. I have unfortunately never talked with them. Only one time Gaile answered to a post i wrote on the official forum. But anyway i hope they're all aware that there is a lot of players like me, often quiet and silent, who just love the result of their job. Tyria is a home sweet home since more than 10 years for me and i will be thankfull for this for a very long time to come. A place where i change my mind. A place where i have fun and friends. A place where i met nice people. A place where i often can rest and breath. Just thanks for that. Thanks to everybody in the company which made me meet my wife !!!
---
Do story instances scale with more players?
---
If I join a friends story instance, can I still get the achievements? For example, the lw3 and 4 mastery achievements?
---
But the content quality is getting better and better and I'm pretty happy witht he current state of the game. That's what I think. 
---
All these "the game is dying/everything will end now" stuff comes up everytime you give something to speculate to the community. 
---
"Fractal and Raid teams are one team? That's why we don't get new raids!"
---
"Colin Johanson leaves Anet? The game will die now!"
---
"Dev XY left? Oh no, this will kill the whole part he worked in!"
---
And way more we heared everytime anything "happened". It's not "what they really think", it's just drama. Overreacting because you can't do anything else about it. 
---
They were quick to delete 2 of my posts and give me a warning on my account on the forums though. Like 1984 over there. I was saying quite supportive stuff too!
---
great post. I agree with your analysis. 
---
Here’s my concern. 
---
The lack of planned/announced expansion work, coupled with the news of the past few days and the siphoning off of devs onto other projects, tells me that ArenaNet was planning on keeping GW2 alive with Living Story only (possibly even charging for it, but that’s just an opinion I’ve had for a while), with the HoT and PoF expansion team probably working on other stuff. 
---
Now, all those other projects are cancelled. ANet is going to be under pressure to make more money on GW2. They primarily do this with expansions. However I don’t believe that an expansion is even in the works. So now the team really only has however long LS5 will take to fully release, to build a new expansion from the ground up. 
---
At 6 episodes, they could stretch this to 18 months, but I doubt NCsoft will be willing to wait that long. So season 5 will either be shorter, or have tighter deadlines and release schedules, and the expac team will have to scramble to pull together an expansion in about a year.  
---
If they are laying off the people who were moved on to other projects, then it's not going to change GW2 development speed, for better or worse. Those people won't be moving back to GW2, they're just not going to have a job anymore.
---
they did not, your memory is incorrect. that is the thursday wvw stream, which was in no way (officially) related to the warclaw. the friday stream, which was announced together with the mount was supposed to be dedicated to that.
---
Sell us a 'support arenanet' t shirt skin and I'd buy it!
---
My uncle works at Nintendo. 
---
No reason given; darn
---
I didn't say to ignore everything, so read my post. I said to not be so doom and gloom and drop yourself into a self fulfilling prophecy that kills a game. Enjoy what you have but it doesn't mean you should totally blind yourself from the events going on within. We now know GW2 is going to be unaffected so that point is moot anyways.
---
Just want to add that there was easily 1000+ ppl waiting.
---
*Woah!* It's your **2nd Cakeday** Hm_Rain! ^(hug)
---
Thats is more a problem of MMO genre by itself. The genre is dying, there is no new people trying the game.  
---
I tried to show the game to some cousin (12-14 years old, i am 27.) And nope... they found it to slow, boring, old stuff....   
---
Wasn't a skeleton crew. They are only laying off people working on non-GW2 related content.
---
So is political journalism.
---
Both feast on gullible people, blood, sweat and tears though, and are at its core anti-consumer.
---
I misread your comment - I agree
---
Hopefully you actually did something other than stare at the offline stream.
---
Man a lot of these people saying "Well if you'd just tell us there is no stream today everything would be fine!" are the same people who would still throw a shitstorm if they did. 
---
Lol, even if you work in the gaming industry, you can't look into players mind...
---
What you are writing here is nothing more than baseless assumptions. 
---
For example, I'm german and most german players (I know), especially the older ones, don't want to read the english forum or reddit, because it's english. In the german forum this topic as barely existant, there is only one thread with a few answers. Same in one of the community forums (the one I look at, too), one thread, one answer, that's it. 
---
Also, I play GW2 since beta and played GW1 before. I payed for the game(s), I play the game and I do care about the game, and I started to look into reddit only a bit more than a year ago and use the official forum maybe since HoT and only now and then. 
---
So I absolutely don't fit in what you said. According to your statement I would either don't pay and care about the game at all **or** would have been active in forums since launch. None of them is the case. And I'm definitely not alone. I know many people who don't want to use reddit or even the official forum, but still love the game. 
---
Like I said, baseless assumtions, nothing else.
---
Gamesjournospros discord group, among other backstage enclaves where they meet and agree on what trends or narratives they want to push and what they want to ignore.
---
It's why youtube reviews have become more popular. Their job prospects don't hinge on following whatever political agenda their editor wants to push.
---
Understandable, I doubt anyone really feels like streaming there and it would have just been a depressing stream. :(
---
Dude, Reddit is a tiny minority of the playerbase even if we count non-f2p accounts. To think otherwise is delusional
---
I used to raid in a hardcore raid guild playing with a ps3 game pad and it was fine.
---
Hiiiiint &lt;3
---
I'd like to know too. This was a super annoying "feature."
---
Very valuable post. :-) Thanks. 
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.
---
No, they won't do it.
---
Did the same mistake, made a support ticket, they said it was intended.
---
gotten to  the character select screen but at soon as i load the map i crash
---
&gt; In well supported game people wouldnt even notice that there were some layoffs.
---
how would the quality of a game's support have any effect whatsoever on what gets reported and read on gaming news sites?
---
Isn't WoW pretty well supported? seems like their layoffs were just as noticeable and I don't even play that game.

You didn't say anything about wvw content and no, I'm not kidding. Since PoF they have released new maps, new legendaries, new fractals, updates to water combat, sitable chairs, plenty of balance patches, a better system for accessing cosmetic items like chairs, kites and instruments and a new mount just off the top of my head. That's hardly zero content.

Yeah now more than ever they need to learn this lesson and get rid of that policy of not talking about future content until it's done. I personally not interested in waiting another year for a new expansion.

They’re both multiplayer and single player and they both have DLC not to mention that PoF was at launch a $30  expansion that required no previous purchase the $30 alone wouldn’t cover the cost to develop PoF

Warframe has a pretty good version of this, actually. lets you fiddle with inventory, do crafting, check limited-time missions, a little bit of passive resource gain, and a news page
