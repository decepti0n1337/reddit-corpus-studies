I have wanted to see some bosses with breakable parts that can disable certain attack or put the boss in vulnerable state for a while, I don't think that will be this but would be awesome if it was.
---
---
---
You're talking to a brick wall.
---
Game has been dead for years.
---
It's nonsense. You swap from your PvE build to your PvP build back and forth without issue.
---
Use keybinds.
---
They decoupled the build templates and allow people to assign them as they please. You can just have a template for PvP and swap to that for PvP.
---
If you're going into this game focused on ever increasing stats, man are you going to be disappointed. 
---

---
Top stats are easy to get. Specific skins, on the other hand, which unlock on your entire account, are what sells most things.
---
You'll often find 2 or 3 things in the trading post with the exact same stats and wildly different prices. The prices are almost always based on 3 things: the skin, whether you need it for an achievement, or what sigil or rune you can salvage from it.
---
In most games stats are the be all end all, but this is more of a skill based game, in that how you execute is at least important (and some would say more important) than your stats.
---
Every class "is" viable in PvE depending on your build
---
Zerker gear is probably cheaper to buy off TP if you are looking for those stats. You want to use that for stuff like Viper's
---
[Still applies](https://imgur.com/gallery/2qMRlXX)
---
Implies mismanagement, then.
---
Well considering Halloween existed in those last two months and tons of people farmed the labyrinth, I'd guess that's what most people were doing.
---
I was doing a lot of stuff, including catching up on achievements in the new zone, getting multiple alts through because I do that, and all the halloween stuff.
---
Halloween came with a couple of new races, but also two new weapon collections for a shield and greatsword.
---
Plus I made a couple of legendary weapons.

Sure, as with all classes. But solo? Nope. You can only tank so much until the tools given to you for self sustain ( [Invigorated Precision](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Invigorating_Precision) and [Signet of Malice](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Signet_of_Malice) in particular) lose their effectiveness.
---
&gt;  end content on raids 
---
Yep. Both power and condition based builds, though condi is more niche.
---
&gt; How actively (or not) were you in game? 
---
I'm on the *"*not" part, just saying.
---
However, if no one every bought gems and then used those to buy gold, gems would continue to cost more and more gold over time.

---
This is really helpful. Thank you!
---
What channel do most people post these in when needing to travel? I use my Guild channel (they must hate me posting rando wps... but my Guild is not hugely active. I wouldn't dream of putting them in map or say chat. 
---
is there a chat channel that's only for yourself??
---
I do 1-230 lines.  
---
You do 231-460 lines.  
---
If someone else joins, he does 461-686, otherwise we'll split once we get there.
---
That depends on your perspective. As someone that never used templates before the change, it didn't affect me much.
---
Skyscale
---
Thief can solo bounties.. you'll be hard pressed to find a hot hp that it can't do.
---
Preeeeetty much. There are so many things that GW1 did better that baffle me as to why they were changed.
---
This thread is about automatically swapping to the wvw and pvp build when you enter those areas.  A basic feature included with the game for many years.
---
Agree, right around the time everyone got covered in glitter and auras
---
Not sure if it's people being surprised or simply disappointed/ frustrated that ANet uses the same materials over and over again when we are drowning in ones that are only used for 1-3 recipes.
---
Ive seen how aws actually had cut costs, also for enterprises, they can give discounts that can go up to 60% of the on demand prices. Most of the costs in this game probably go into in memory cache and network events, but i don’t think the costs are really that high compared to the revenues, probably most of the money goes to the staff.
---
he looks like Illidan.
---
20k hours is really really really a lot. wow.
---
So, before pof, and hot and trough out all these years, have you always played meta builds for wvw?
---
Have you tried to come up with something new or gimmicky for your squad?
---
Cause if you were always following the meta, whats the problem in playing the current one?
---
Is the problem of the meta never actually changing in any meaningful way for a very very long time so you get to play the same 2-3 professions for months and years?
---
You’re mistake is thinking that i care what I sound like :p ohhh nooOoO not downvotes on the subreddit!! How will I continue to live!!??
---
I do solo content all the time with deadeye p/p builds
---
By any chance, have you done the twice told legend achievement?
---
If you havent, which one would you craft if you had to pick? I assume one that could be dual wielded like a dagger or a sword?
---
I’m playing gw1 almost daily. It’s a blast.
---
To be fair, the icebow/fgs meta died over 5 years ago. The main thing keeping dungeons dead is the power creep. Though I definitely agree the run-past-trash mobs because they're worthless meta is trash.
---
dude its a fucking reddit page. you dont like it? go do something else.
---
/s isn't a gw2-subreddit only term. While it sucks you didn't know the term, it isn't the subreddit's fault you didn't know.
---
I mean that is to be expected to an extent for those of us that have played since launch. Of course there could (or should) be more to keep the veterans returning, but I've gotten *so much* out of this game over the years personally that I'm ok with it. I'd rather take a break in between episodes then keep running the same content over and over and getting burnt out. And when I do return, it's always such a nice feeling coming back to my preferred style of mmo.
---
Where did I say it was a guild wars only thing? Please show me. I said not everyone on Reddit know all of the lingo. Why is that so hard to get through your head?
---
I understand. 
---
I also understand when someone says "i quit the game because xyz" -&gt; after they spent a ridiculous amount of time playing it for years and have nothing left to do in the game besides wait for the next patch and see whats new.
---
Yeah, i usually always have fun playing LoL . Even tho its "the same thing over and over", its just fun to play.  
---
Tho i usually only go for aram.
---
You do know that you can uncheck a checkbox? Just uncheck all checkboxes and nothing changes for you.
---
Not to mention that you can still change between all 3 templates in all 3 modes. The checkbox should do nothing more than to autoswitch the template when you enter PvP or WvW. After entering a different mode you should still be able to freely switch between all templates.
---
I really like deepstone. It's fast paced enough to not make me think "UGH", but it's interesting and long enough that you can't just run past trash mobs.
---
Not all fractals are ever going to be masterfully designed like 99 and 100. Deep stone is far from perfect, but it's also very far from bad
---
Not the same and a dishonest comparison.
---
I've been having fun, every day I roll a d9 to see what class I'm playing, then do what ever that character is up to (thief is world complete, rev is pvp, mes pof story, guardian skyscale unlock etc.)
---
It really is a sad state of affairs that whenever we see something cool in this game our first thought is "Hope it's for sale!"
---
so what is it now you didn't saw the /s or you didn't know what it meant ?
---
but yeah you're not caring at all, and its proved by your salty edit and this message ... Don't you realise that by being so blatant you just ridicule yourself. 
---
And sorry but i was talking about the edit you made, you know the part where you talk like a salty bitch ;)
---
oh and good for you that you edited your message but you still missed some your/you're
---
Careful, a ton of semi- and hard- core players really dislike "new" fractals if it means stuff like Siren's Reef.  In case you don't know what Siren's Reef is, it's a pretty island on the surface, but the gameplay is essentially mindless hordes of ghosts after ghosts. 
---
The playerbase, at one point, liked Molten Boss so much that they decided to come up with a tryhard team composition and farm it.  ANet didn't like this, so they turned it into mindless hordes upon hordes of mobs.  Similarly, Aquatic was proven too "easy" or something after a few players were able to prove soloability to the final boss, and now difficult champions precede the final champion.  
---
They're not rewarding clever play (skips, etc), and clearly prefer to meet some timegate quota.  Maybe they should make invisible walls around all the trees in Arah and add 10x more enemies for the lurking dungeoneers to feel some of the same pain.
---
Yeah that's one of the largest perks for thief, loads of viable builds in solo. Initiative rather than CD really shines here.
---
Nice. I think this is something a lot of people dont even think about.
---
There are a lot of passionate old veterans who played for 2k,4k,10k,20k+ hours and say "i quit because xyz"
---
But when i think about when i start at 2012, to have 25 zones, 9 dungeons and a handful of fractals, and a storyline that cant be replayed compared to todays amount of zones, exploration, fractals and raids as well as new story which is on a whole new level... i just wish i could experience it again as new players are experiencing it today.
---
PvP and Automated Tournaments. With monthly every 2 weeks trying to catchup to all the missed ones, activity spiked up a lot for the people that do tournaments.
---
16 complete clears of world 1 and world 2 in tribulation mode. I never got super good at it, but I typically did one clear per day, around 15-20 minutes to clear world 1 and 45-60 minutes to clear world 2.
---
Least you can pvp with no worries of botters ruining the game unlike the Gw1 community. Least we  get templates though.
---
As far as classes that can cheese challenging content like some Hero Points, Thief is amongst the best at doing it. It's not as braindead as using Reaper, minions and stuff, but the class has plenty of tools for players to do that.
---
I didn’t see/acknowledge the /S because I didn’t know what it meant. Why the fuck are you so obsessed over it? Yeah I Edit when I make spelling typos you fucking spazz. 
---
I genuinely don’t care how I’m portrayed when I’m being such a “blatant salty bitch” because you’re being an even worse one, so really your contradicting yourself. 
---
I already admitted my wrong and moved on, what’s shoved so far up your ass today that you can’t do the same? :)
---
If you are looking at open world content, go for Reaper. If not, please specify what  content you are looking to play.
---
Strike Missions are semi-Raid content, Fractals are the successors to Dungeons. There are distinct differences.
---
Yep, I did it with two frostfangs.
---
They gave us three builds for each character. I dont understand what everyone is complaining about. Before we only had the auto switched ones for pvp and wvw. We have one more now..
---
It's "in progress" just like WvW alliances are and templates were, and seeing how the latter has turned out, I'd rather keep the bug.
---
&gt; it's very disappointing
---
So is the whole studio past HoT.
---
I guess you haven't played through Season 3 then...
---
I somehow finally got the motivation to finish the golden fractal weapon collection and while i farmed for that i also did a few fractal related achievements i thought where to hard for me.
---
You need to brush-up on your Barbie lore.
---
yeah sure you made a mistake and moved and was so over it that you trashed the sub in your edit, just like the way you answer show that you don't care at all ;)
---
B L A T A N T
---
Observatory doesn't feel good with sub-par DPS.  For example, tonight I only had to do like 65% of the marble path because my team phased her before I returned to the boss on my Renegade.  When you have bad DPS Sobs may as well be a mini-raid; whereas when you have strong DPS you get through it in like 15 minutes?
---
Sorry for asking for group content in mmo.
---
Bro whatever you say doesn’t even matter since you ALSO took the time to be snarky for no fucking reason and reply to this thread when it was over. But sure let’s keep going pal
---
Not gem store related so not a priority.
---
I ran through most of Grothmar to see it once, did the strike mission half a dozen times (got nothing). Farmed halloween for a few things on the store I wanted, but I can't actually tell you what they were because I don't remember. Bought some home instance nodes with gold.
---
Since then I log in for dailies and to harvest my home instance/guild hall. I'm working on my third legendary, Claw of the Khan-Ur, at a slow pace.
---
But I've been doing RL stuff and playing other games (Streets of Rogue, both the tabletop and PC version of Ascension, and some RL D&amp;D).
---
Login, WvW dailies, one or two metas, story progression on secondary characters, Halloween Lab farm.
---
Log in, do 3 daily things, log out, play Titan Quest.
---
Sure.  Everything is "viable," but that doesn't mean it's objectively good in specific contexts (eg; Raids/FoTM, WvW etc).
---
Its been years since HOT and the final story instance is still bugged.
---
Fractal CMs + T4s.  That's pretty much it other than when I raid on the weekends.
---
It's been basically the same firebrand,scourge, spellbreaker meta since the start of pof which was.....over 2 years ago now. It wasn't fun to play then and it isn't fun to play now
---
yeah yeah but i'm not the one who said he don't care, made an edit to trash a sub over a mistake i made, and edit my answers to add more lines. i responded because your edit was stupid, but the more you talk the more it feels like a norm for you
---
Uninstalled, played outer worlds, moving to archeage unchained soon.
---
What lmao, I would have figured you would have mentioned the timegated platform section. Your complaints make no sense for the final boss. Teleporting adds what, maybe 30 extra seconds of just moving towards the new location? I've legit never heard of anyone complaining about the final boss, if anything it's too easy.
---
The same thing for you man. Everything you just said. It’s like your holding up a mirror LOL. And the funniest thing is that you don’t even realize it :)
---
Friends for most of the stuff I do yes, lfg is a cesspool that I don't like to poke.
---
lol this is your best answer by far ;)
---
Thank you very much :)
---
Hero.
---
we don't have one more now- we used to have PvE, PvP, and WvW builds that automatically changed; now we have 3 general-use builds that need to be manually changed. It's only a bonus if you only play one game mode on one character and wanted to swap quickly between a couple different builds.
---
You're completely missing the point as usual.  I'm not talking about the little adds; I'm talking about the boss itself.  When you have 3-4 people doing 20-30k burst DPS or more you spend more time chasing the boss than you do fighting him.  The fact that you think I'm talking about the "shades" says more about your experience w/ the Fractal than anything else lul.
---
I stumbled upon this deleted thread  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/2ryrvb/3d\_fan\_art\_with\_tutorial\_for\_your\_own\_render/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/2ryrvb/3d_fan_art_with_tutorial_for_your_own_render/)  and I really would like to try for my own amusement and some ideas that I have. Is there something similar that will work?
---
or maybe 
---
Opression&gt;Freedom
---
Freedom&gt;Rebellion
---
Rebellion&gt;Opression
---
Or you are just trying to do things as a glass raid build.
---
Camp can be soloed during peak hours. Just gotta be quick and inconspicuous… and a little lucky to not summon the wrath of a zerg or havoc group.
---
Nonsense is the idea that skill matters a rat's ass. When the content is a pushover like these shit maps, they get done in a week and become ghost towns in less than a month, a total waste of resources.
---
Raids and dungeons that actually challenge players keep them coming back to progress through the content, which is what gives PvE content longevity. There's a reason Borderland players progress among the different difficulties and don't just stay on easy mode, as do most other games. Adding difficulty is the only way to keep PvE alive short of quick cadence release, which is unsustainable. PvE is not spontaneous with opponents adapting to you and making every encounter different, so introducing execution challenges to PvE content is the only way to keep content alive.
---
What makes Condi Thief more niche? Is it just the condi part - that more fights are suited to power over condi - or is there something specific about Thief condi that makes it less desirable?
---
that's a bot.
---
I don't do that stupid shit. My penis never rests!
---
If the new fractals are gonna be anything like sirens reef or deepstone...
---
Weeeell.....
---
I could do with another 311 days without a new one...
---
I haven't done it personally, but I've seen engineers solo keep lords. It took a long ass time, no idea how he was that patient haha.
---
Tip: "Story" counts as a path for the infinitely repeatable AP that gives you a choice chest of 100 dungeon tokens.
---
Wendigos are generally non-corporeal spirits or humans driven mad and possessed, these look more like something from European mythos than the Algonquin-speaking nations.
---
When the prologue came out, several days spread out to do the story,  complete the map, and get the /rockout emote. Then there were several evenings doing Roller Beetle races with a friend competing for tge best time. Halloween was basically spent the same way on Mad Kings Raceway.
---
Then every week on the monday I raid with a group of friends. But thats not specific for the last 2 months, thats been weekly routine for years. And thats fine, playing this game for 1-2 days a week means I have plenty of time to play other games
---
Its effectiveness can also vary fairly significantly depending on your group, since they fire off a whirl finisher with nearly every button they press. If those are throwing out burning or poison, you'll be a lot more effective than if they're just throwing out condition clears or vuln.
---
Playing my single player backlog and replaying some souls games.
---
They don't really add much stuff that I'd care about anymore and lately , even though you see other players around, game felt like single player, so might as well play good one.
---
No new fractal for almost year, no new raid, no noteworthy group content added. I'm a little bit curious about those 3 strikes (though I don't really understand why they have to be on weekly rotation)  but I don't have much hope.
---
I think I've spent too much time in gw2 already and just got tired. Might be good idea to just move on for good.
---
Moral of the story - don't waste currency on minis.
---
I'm not sure why you're even caring about this, then. You admit to not using the website that much, meaning that this isn't really a problem for someone like you. It also means you're not savvy to a *very* common bit of "formatting", for lack of a better term. But you're familiar with multiple people (since you did say partner*s*. Plural.) who consider a problem, which shows in *any* system with up and down markers. Implying that you are somehow selectively informed and uninformed. About a problem endemic to the entire internet.
---
You admit that your behavior is unacceptable, yet you do it because it "matches what you see here". Paraphrased, of course. So you don't want to lead by example.  
---
Now, I'm sure I'll sound like I'm repeating myself, but... Why are the downvotes an issue for you? You've, twice now, complained about them, specifically, and claimed they're being abused. Yet here I am talking to you just fine, as if they didn't exist.
---
What do you think would have happened, had you kept your cool and edited your comment to say something like "Oh, he was being sarcastic..I didn't know that's what they meant. My bad."? What if you hadn't responded at all? You'd be able to walk into another topic and comment just like any other time. And lastly, what if you had just reported the offending comments and moved on? That's why the system is there.
---
if you have issues staying alive, try radiance runes. It gives a bit more boon duration over other runes, but also some vitality.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Rune_of_Radiance
---
Other damage mitigation comes from wall of reflection and Aegis. Don't be afraid to change utilities based on encounter.
---
On condi heavy encounters, use skill 5 on Tome of Resolve first, as it converts 5 condies to boons and increases healing. The guide you linked explains these things quite well.
---
Couldn't agree more, I was playing GW1 recently and love how easy and lightweight the build templates are.
---
They're worse in gw2 in every way. They'll not get a cent more from me until I see change.
---
Very much mutual suffering RayBun! Also yes, Taco guide markers are incredibly useful as well as binding a jump dodge key! Or mastering jump dodge! Try find a friend to do it with too to help ease the suffering! That's good to have a goal to work towards and the cube infusions are cool! It keeps a person busy \^\^
---
Bro dude what the fuck ever I’m already over it. It’s over and done. Goodbye.
---
Oh... Explains alot then. I assumed it could be a similar use case to open world.
---
When I eventually take this fb to fractals, can I still hang on to litany of wrath? I'm not sure if I can keep myself topped off with just mantra heal and F2.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt; Re: swiftness, I'm assuming you mean quickness. They have similar names, but Swiftness just makes you run faster, while quickness makes your attacks faster. 
---
TIL. I thought it was used interchangeably all this while. 
---
Thanks for your input!
---
So what you're saying is, it's not the size (of the dev team) that matters, it's how you use it?
---
Imagine if they had upgraded stats for agony and made the fractals harder each exp while resetting the ar treadmill. But that would have resulted in them continuing to develop a sustem, rather than avandoning it.
---
World vs world. Map completion to make jugg
---
If you just faceroll F1 to F4 with no clones, you already do more than what steal does. An untraited steal does nothing except teleport the thief; at least shatters actually have some basic effect. Traited shatters vs traited steal is more even but shatters are still better due to versatility. Not to mention the clones themselves dealing damage as well.
---
Mesmer has plenty of access to stun/daze via weapon skills and utilities, way more than thief. You have also Diversion for daze for free. Steal needs a trait for that. The only advantage steal has over Diversion is range but it's literally a non-issue for mesmer due to mantra, pistol 5, and staff 5 all having 1200 range.
---
Steal is also useless in a zerg fight. At least if you blink into a zerg, Mind Wrack and Cry of Frustration hit 5 people compared to 1 from Steal. LOL
---
Exactly. They should either not exist or drop (somewhat valuable) loot. Sorry if I didn't make my opinion clear enough.
---
Completely unnecessary unless you are dying 200+ times without clearing a zone. You get so many baubles from tribulation that its almost impossible to die.
---
Not sure I said anything about pvp.....
---
Stop being so fucking negative. You're all just videogame addicts. You have to enter, play for some minutes, and then turn off the UI to enjoy this game like a walking simulator and see where all the budget goes into: PURE SOUND IMMERSION /s
---
Even if its not how we do it, I am still gonna at least circle it on a skimmer the first few times :D
---
"We're all a bit mad around here!" ~Cheshire Cat
---
Thats what the ladies tell me
---
By manually changing you mean clicking the mouse a few times then yeah you do have to manually change it.  Again not a big deal.  I have 4 level 80s.  The system works fine for me.  I don't see ever needing more builds and I play wvw a lot.
---
Don't delete the old one! Gifts are tied to character age. You get slots with hot
---
Agree, their difficulty is unjustified and they're hard "just because".
---
&gt;     I can almost deal with the gems for extra template slots
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I see we are already in the acceptance stage...
---
I will consider unlocking more loadout slots when they chop the price in half and make the feature account wide.
---
Guardian is pretty meta in all pve play modes. Dragon hunter is a strong dps class and heal fire brand is a good off healer, both are sought after in most groups. Boon chrono is trickier to play but highly sought after in all high level pve play and the power chrono is a good open world build. Necro has power necro which is ez mode for all open world content and is decent for high level content, it also has heal and condi scourge which is useful in lots of end game content.
---
Also id buy path of fire, i believe hot comes with it free right now
---
Thanks, will have to reread the tooltips again later when I login. Swapping into firebrand feels like a tonne of new stuff I need to read.
---
If i'm running mantra, aside from using it as aegis. How do you top yourself off in case of a screw up? 
---
&gt; Playing solo, you should also swap out Perfect Inscriptions for Righteous Instincts 
---
Gotcha, i'll try swapping out a few traits. I always had the impression that fractals was just open world but harder so I just followed the first guide I saw.
---
So yeah, you're fine with the trinkets you'll get until 50.
---
Guardian, revenant, mesmer  elementalist all strong choices.
---
I personally find guardian pretty dull but the other 3 are great.
---
I've done this path a thousand times, and I somehow have never seen this before.
---
Is it just me or does this look like a topless Eir Stagalkin looking at the sky and breathing fire?
---
We... literally see a shot of it in the trailer... The Icebrood Construct part of that Svanir boss fight. [At 48 seconds in](https://youtu.be/O2JpdQCldWs?t=48)
---
seriously who the fuck votes for Kiel.
---
Yeah WvW is jealous of all the attention you are getting. 🤣
---
I've been playing the game on and off pretty much every day but not in any particularly intense capacity. I've been a raider for over a year now and have all the gear and builds I could feasibly want, so my gold has gone largely to gem conversion. Hence why I haven't been playing as much. I'm very, very slowly working toward Meteorlogicus, but the build loadouts pretty much nixed any incentive I have to go for other legendaries, armor or otherwise. 
---
Aside from that, I've been playing the Medievil Remake. I love it to pieces, I haven't played that game since my childhood. IDK though, I feel like I've hit an age where my passion for gaming has gone down immensely. It's likely I won't play games much if at all when I start going to college again and work part  time on top of it.
---
I typically log on for reset and do tequatl, casino, leyline, and then sometimes continue on with metas if I feel like it (TD, octo, deathbranded shatterer, etc), but more often I just do the first three. Then, a lot of the times, I do T4's and recs with my friends (there's typically 3 of us so we just pug the rest). At some point, I try to grab guild hall nodes, my home instance, and use my gobblers. That's it for the daily "routine". 
---
Outside of that, if I want to play, I'll do a pvp match or two (I've been getting more into pvp the past two seasons), or do some other stuff. If there's a meta or worldboss up that I like and I haven't done yet I might try to catch it. My friends and I have been working on 99CM and 100CM, and I also do raids with my guild once or twice a week (we typically do one or two wings each time, I'm not full clearing every raid wing every week). I also do a keyfarm once a week. Beyond that, I've been farming things I need to work on gearing characters and such, and I was leveling a new character to 80 manually for the first time in a full year, so that was an interesting experience. Also replayed story up to level 60 while doing it, which was fun enough that it made me decide to finish personal story on some alts that have only done thru claw island, so that's what I'm doing now when I have nothing else to do in game and don't feel like farming gold/mats/berries/whatever.
---
Judging from the environment and the unique design, is this not the third new boss for Strike Missions? Does upgraded Icy actually count as a "new boss"?
---
I haven't!  she's a necromancer.  Might use that bundled identity repair kit to change her looks
---
if you are looking for pve builds (specifically open world), you are best off going power zerker (typically this regardless of profession). 
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Firebrand_-_Quickness_Greatsword
---
You get your max damage output when you have your greatsword equiped and have the retaliation buff on you (look at the middle trait line in Radiance called Retribution). If you have your symbol damage buff, retaliation buff, and using your gs symbol skill and the skill 2 spin move, that will be your strongest burst attack.
---
With your heal skill you should be using the mantra. Try avoiding using all 3 uses of your skill 6 heal skill because there will be a long recharge. You also have your F2 healing tome that can give you really strong burst healing with page skills 1, 2, and 5. But, if you are having issues surviving in open world, then you really need to work on your dodging and timing it right.
---
Swiftness doesn't matter because the duration stacks, so you can just use it whenever.
---
And finally like I said before, in open world as well as in Fractals and Raids, the most reliable stat set is full berserker with either runes or the scholar (usually), or thief, or whatever. The faster you kill something, the better chance you have of surviving the fight.
---
It will drop from the strike mission at 50% the drop rate of the hats.
---
Fractal guides usually assume potions, too, which give more boon duration.
---
Also T4 Security gives the [Bladed Armor Box](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bladed_Armor_Box) which is -any- armor piece for any weight class in addition to the afforementioned stats selects. Bladed Coat box are the rarest for random drops for a full choice box is nice.

Currently testing the waters of other classes cause i'm kinda tired of playing soulbeast atm. Necro is next on the list after fb though!
---
I'll take a look at that one! Was abit worried they weren't updated to the recent update.
---
&gt; But, if you are having issues surviving in open world, then you really need to work on your dodging and timing it right. 
---
I'll try to get a hang of using mantra. Too used to using heals as a 'oh shit' button. Is there something I can do against mob auto attacks? I'm ok with moving out of circles and avoiding the obvious wind up attacks but I feel the bulk of the damage I receive is from regular attacks. Any tips?
---
WvW, but not much in the last few weeks, barely touched the new zone. Drop rate for the new helm just pushed me over the edge, mostly playing other games.  Modern Warfare, BF5, Stellaris, Outer Worlds, etc.  Halo Reach is coming soon too.
---
This... I did not consider. I assumed that on it's own the firebrand is able to provide 100% quickness to the team and was struggling to get it right on the golem. I got 3 pieces of diviners to help me out but I'm still having issues. Is full diviners fb a thing? Or it's overkill?
---
It doesn't, you can just stat swap as normal
---
Smart thank you
---
Definitely! I'm posting this cause I feel that I might be missing some points from the guide. I'm just having problems keeping quickness up and staying alive long enough (which a comment suggested not using the mantra heal)
---
Tbh, I really like using axe. Running around in axe/shield as my main weapon feels a little more tankier than using other weapons. Nice animation is a plus too. 
---
I'm considering doing full diviners just to keep quickness up as long as possible. But i'm not sure if this is a good idea since most of the builds I see seem to run full berserkers.
---
So unlike players, npcs auto attacks are less frequent. Your goal would to try to use your dodges, aegis, blocks, blind, side stepping etc. to avoid damage. But no typically auto attacks from npcs are weak compared to their special skills. As I said before, you goal is to pump out as much dps as possible because the faster they die, the less damage you take. 
---
Can I ask what maps you are having trouble in? Is it Path if Fire maps or what?
---
It should be noted that dying doesn't hurt you
---
Anet's total ignorance of bugs over the last 7 years has ensued that I never invest any time in any new games related to NCSoft, including any future that involves GW3. Nothing pisses me off more than them earning money and fixing next to nothing. The amount of time elapsed to see tons of fixes and yet have received none is completely inexcusable. Kiss quality of life updates goodbye.
---
This is what gem store support earns you, gem store focused content creation and neglect elsewhere.
---
&gt; I don't understand what sort of dialogue this is supposed to create
---
Here are some ideas
---
 
---
-  Your first experience running a engineer with action camera
---
-  That first time you did action camera in relatively hard content just for laughs.
---
-  Other things that you do in game for fun that are just outside the norm.
---
Or if you don't have anything constructive to say, just don't say anything.
---
I note your response framework.
---
I also note you have no provided OP a response in line with your framework.
---
Pity.
---
I don't understand what the basis for your position is.
---
Yesterday I was just doing the world bosses and the pres leading up to them. 
---
&gt; Can I ask what maps you are having trouble in? Is it Path if Fire maps or what? 
---
With the firebrand so far only used her in Tyria and some Auric Basin meta (and the smaller events around the proximity). I wasn't used to using the mantra as a heal and used it like an 'oh shit' button so it felt like I didn't get enough sustain
---
Yeah, given what was put out in Q3, I would see a 5% revenues decline as a very good sign. It wasn't 20%.
---
Actually there is a way you would know how much AR to have because it shows you how much you need on each level? And the game has /wiki functionality.
---
&gt; I am not advocating a total overhaul, but there's a huge market out there for people who want character progression and give not two figs for cosmetics.
---
Yes, there are other games out there for those players.
---
was basically arah puggin despite halloween events (i pretty much just arah), but got burnt out despite casually playing and approaching stuff differently
---
He was answering your question... not the OP you child.  Holy shit you come across as wildly immature.
---
 Gaming industry is hopeless right now. A friend of mine worked for one of the biggest brands and he quit about 7 years ago. He said I would not do this. Companies are working for their shareholders. You gotta milk the cow. People who work there just want their wages and move on. Gw 2 is also no diffrent from any other big companies. Gw 1 had its peak. Look at all the Devs who passionate about the industry most of them left their job allready, some of them made their own studios.
---
 When the music changes, the walls of city shake. - Plato
---
Stability is not the same as stagnation. Gw2 is not stagnating, its stable.
---
God no.
---
Yes, I see they replied to me and not OP. And that's a pity, don't you agree?
---
Would you like to respond to OP instead? It seems people are more drawn to my comment than they are inclined to generate dialogue in the thread.
---
i played a little bit of destiny, little bit of arma 3, finally did a playthrough of fo3 that i finished and for the past week or so i've only been playing RDR 2
---
The model designs continue to evolve so nicely.

you forgot the "major wvw overhaul" they promised with HoT.

Like everyone said, bind dodge-jump and download TACO and Tekkit shortcuts for tribulations.
---
As completing strategy; for W1 I recommend you to learn shortcuts, get fast and do Z1-2-3 over and over (not daily). Normally people think Z1 is the easiest but once you lose your muscle memory those shotcuts take longer than long paths. This way you'll be done with it quite fast.
---
For W2 I completed Z1 over and over and for the remaining days of SAB festival did Z2-Z3 daily. This way Z2-Z3 would casually take me 40 minutes, a time you can invest everyday while you spam easier zones in weekends on your free time. Whole process took me like 7-9 days and I didn't even go to SAB for the rest of the festival...
---
At least Molten Boss still has a nice skip in the beginning. And people say dungeons are dead...

Fire emblem: 3 houses. This game has consumed my life
---
I was just trying to help you with your lack of understanding.  You're welcome, have a great night!
---
&gt; Least you can pvp with no worries of botters
---
Um......... check some pvp threads.
---
You can always use extra ascended gear if you don’t mind destroying your runes every once not a while
---
As long as people keep buying gem shit they dont care.
---
Well to be fair it’s very easy to die in meta events because of all those giant monsters and aoes etc. I wouldn’t worry about making a specific build for world events. The build I showed you is an example of a pve build. If you want to send me a mail in game (Eight Samurai) and I’ll show you my power Quickbrand build which is very helpful for you, and those close to you as it provides some support. The build is also used in fractals and raids.
---
Steal *is* thief’s only profession mechanic combined with stolen items. To get that much bloat you have to passby a lot of other options.
---
But yeah, steal is thief’s trump. Steal timing is the most important aspect of the class as all of thief utility skills are mediocre versions of skills other classes have. Thief does low damage unless you react perfectly and combo right then you win 1v1s unscathed. But again it takes a lot of skill and prediction.
---
Past 2 months. I have had great time!.. In other mmos.
---
Only done dailies in gw2 (exciting), and had to leave raid static because I just got burntout for running same few bosses every week. Arenanet forced me to be casual.
---
Yes you’re right it’s only for art, low effort memes, and other fluff
---
That's how I read it too. 😐
---
thanks now ive failed no nut november
---
How do you get reshade working in GW2?
---
Appreciate it! I'll drop you a mail when I log in.
---
I can just compose to 'Eight Samurai' right? Don't need the 4 numbers behind it?
---
I didn't try to start an argument. That's your interpretation. You have self control right? You exercised it when you jumped in with insults at me, rather than taking an active role in the thread, right?
---
Lol that's rhetorical. I know you can't tell yourself and would just keep responding as long as i did because having the last hit will make you feel you've won something. 
---
Whiteknighting? Hah. You're attacking my participation in the thread for "attempting to start an argument" but still havent contributed to said thread. Apparently you find me more enticing.
---
Poor OP. Such a pity.
---
thats not how software development works. you usually have a big (depending on how big the software is) bunch of small bugs like that with a very low priority lying around. priorty being players affected \* severity of the bug. Now when those bugs get fixed is usually a mangaement decision. 
---
Of course i am not an Employee of Anet so i cannot be sure if this is how it works but usually you have a bugtracker which works kind of like i described.
---
People loved feature pack 1 tho
---
And raids
---
Same here. They absolutely killed it for me. I just login 1-2 times a week to gather my home instance and thats it. I will play the update but I doubt that I will do all achievements like before. It will be now 5-10 hours gameplay every few months for me till they update wvw or something drastical in a good way.
---
I feel the same
---
Before the "feature" got added and the superior ArcTemplates got disabled I had quite a lot more build variety, now I am stuck with 2-3 builds because switching runes and infusions and stats is not fun.
---
Imo QoL updates like templates should make the game more fun, but in the end they did the opposite.
---
So here I am, not playing many of my favourite builds anymore (those that dont get used frequently, and are not meta).
---
Could it be Devona?
---
so run Mug. FORCING people to enter combat on steal at the START of a traitline is just cheap
---
what if I wanna use steal on a chipmunk for the TP?
---
its less functional if you used to use arc
---
Would people really be satisfied with one new fractal? I would need a entire new set of fractals/dungeons to get me to play that content for longer then 2-3 days.
---
No need to put skins or decorations into a game mode that only the hardcore participate in come on what is this crazy talk. /S
---
I don’t get why people hate it, tho. After a break of GW2 I’ve done T4 Sirens Reef for the first time last week and the last boss took us maybe like 3-4 tries. So nothing unbeatable or as worse as people claim it is.
---
Strikes have more uncommon with world bosses than they do with raids lol.
---
A lot of people are still doing Dragonfall, as well as the Silverwastes. Istan, as far as I know, isn't quite as good as it was.
---
Check this discord out. They do daily Dragonfall which is the best moneymaker right now. It’s EU though, not sure if you are NA/EU.
---

---
IMO while the boss at Oasis has some nice flavour, the actual fight is pretty lame. It's literally just throwing endless amounts of aoes all over the place that all basically feel the same while being different attacks (I'd draw a comparison to Ensolyss where each attack feels distinct and connected to what the boss is actually doing). The fight is also a pain to learn because her attacks basically entirely change in each phase, there's five phases and each is somewhat short.
---
Sure.  That's why you've been downvoted to hidden.  Because you were "participating".  Whatever you gotta tell yourself little buddy.
---
This is so dumb, are you really so slow that right-clicking and choosing statts is such a big problem for you?
---
swapping stats manually was always an option. now, assuming you never used arc, you can have each piece of legendary gear essentially amount to 6 pieces of gear.
---
that would be a fair deal if legendary gear actually costed 6 times the price of ascended gear, but its more like 30 times the cost. the saved inventory space used to be what could be argued as what makes this worth it, but now the armory system makes 6 sets of ascendeds take up as much space as 1 set of legendary.
---
you're essentially paying 5 times the price per piece of gear for the privilege of never having to reroll stats in the mystic forge whenever they do something like nerf spotter and banner stats. plus the skin, but that was really only the case for the pve set and the weapons.
---
Except the full season pack is discounted based in what episodes you previously owned too.
---
Sure, if you run across players you might not have a choice. Often enough, though, you can sneak into camps and other stuff without gaining attention, and then just PvE that to gain participation.
---
Good idea and I took your suggestion and distributed the keys I had. I'll send more out as I get them. Just unfortunate timing with things going crazy at my job so had to pull a lot of extra hours. Put me a little behind my intended schedule to get these handed out.
---
For the sake of your argument, yes:
---
&gt; if stat swap requires a slot in anets "build templates"?
---
The point here was: it is not required. You can still do what you could do before, aside from arcdps that is, sadly.
---
This so much. I use gw2launcher daily for far more accounts than the average user and never had any problems. Clean and minimalistic look, neat options and it has just about anything you might need.
---
Would've worked so well as a raid, or even as a CM fractal.
---
But that's not because legendary is now less functional. It's just that the in-game loadouts do not have all the functionality that arcdps had.
---
DeAd gAMe
---
i agree, that's what i've been trying to keep in mind as i comment in this thread. everything is still just as possible as before, its just not the QoL that it should have been. and if you had arc, then its the opposite of QoL.
---
I'm actually not sure which one would be more expensive (in gold): crafting legendary armor or 6 ascended armors + unlocking 6 equipment templates ^^^^KEKW
---
this is true, and the fundamental difference is that they are loadouts (as you referred to them as, as well) and not templates (as they've been marketed as). infinite storage of arc, aside.
---
&gt; no fucking one swaps stats by hand. we had arcdps build templates for it. now im forced to waste 1 slot in build templates or swap every fucking stat by hand
---
The point this raises is that if you want to say X, then say it. Be precise. Don't assume. If you mean you cannot change stats easily now, while before with arcdps you could, then say that. Don't say 'stat swapping requires build slots', because said like that that's simply false. That's all that comment was about.
---
Yep. Every time I log into do something complicated and realize I can't use arc templates anymore... I lose interest in setting it up fast...
---
right, but as for swapping by hand, i'm talking on a day to day type basis. anytime you need to actually make lasting changes to your build, say because of a balance change, you would have to swap by hand anyways.
---
so i stand by that statement, but revised: the only people who swap by hand when switching between their established roles or when changing game modes are the ones who have to.
---
But I like knowing that Almora is watching me murder plastic spiders
---
Carebears
---
And you dont factor in the price for the provisioner token which is on average 80s
---
&gt; CM's brings your total to ~800/day.
---
Yes. Only groups doing CMs usually require pots, so either you use the pots from the recs (and be quick about it, or those expire) and loose the relics from selling them, or you loose the relics from doing the CMs.
---
Fuck u/AuroraPeachy
---
The reaaon people say to open certain bags around 49 is because some of the lower tier mats are worth more then say some t6 mats. Sw is great for farming gold but it requires you to spend hours doing so to make good gold. Do your dailies first then go to sw at t4 fracts i avrg around 20 gold when im all done not counting the mats i get from breaking everything down plus 2 gold for the open world daily t1 avrg of fracts are around 5 to maybe 8g. The main key to sw is just putting the time in to get enough of the mats and bags to make a good chunk of gold.
---
Im more surprised that in a game about skins and outfits, having lege armor (and using it as such) makes a player lose out on being about to have multiple looks equiped compared to a player that just uses non-legendary armor since you cant have "transmute" templates.
---
I've just made it more compact on smaller resolutions. I hope it's more usable 😇
---
however the behaviour you suggest would introduce an entirely new dimension of annoyance when it come to getting gear *out* of the template system, as you'd be forced to switch between modes to unlink it from every single ~~template~~ loadout.
---
well, a tick occurs every 5 minutes in wvw. it probably wouldn't take you the entire tick to swap your build, but comparatively speaking, a couple minutes could amount to around 50% of a tick. and that's assuming the counter is at exactly 5 minutes when you zone in, when its more likely to be lower, thereby wasting the entire remainder of that tick swapping.
---
in addition, your participation timer maxes out at 10 minutes. a couple minutes spent swapping builds could amount to 25% of your decay timer being wasted, and thats not even counting the time that it would take for you to catch up to your zerg after getting situated. this is also assuming you logged out of wvw with your decay timer at exactly 10 minutes, which is more likely to be lower.
---
its not a lot, but its still not a negligible percentage of the timers that you're working with. and it could even be worse if you have to cross the entirety of EBG or if when you finally catch up to your zerg, they wp back to base.
---
also, i do appreciate you trying to find more reasonable cases in which the swapping times add up for the player.
---
If you're looking for the maximum gold per/h you're gonna want to be doing silverwastes or dragonfall .
---
Wonder if the clock tower removing all buffs cleared this for anyone...
---
feature pack 1 came inbetween s1 and s2, there was no content update with it
---
Exactly, between seasons so not instead of a content update, but in addition to other planned content updates. Important difference.
---
I don't think xpacs do bring an influx of new players. At least not a significant amount. They bump revenue for that quarter, because suddenly everyone who is already playing has to drop $50 to continue the new content, but I having seen evidence that there are a significant amount of people playing after an expansion that were not already playing before it, just random anecdotes about "well me friend started playing" or "I picked it up," but those stories also happen even between expansions. 
---
As far as I can see, revenues are up over this year relative to right after HoT. I mean the last four quarters made 60m, whereas the four quarters after HoT's launch made 53m. We also don't know what their budget is like, but with less staff, their profits might actually be higher than before. 
---
If they invest in making an XPac today, it would likely come at the expense of reducing the scope or pacing of the LW content. People would have less fun and less reason to play at all over the next year or so as they built up enough material to be worth releasing as an expansion. Whatever it is they have planned over this next year, they would likely only be able to deliver half as much, or less, if they had to split their focus like that. 
---
Which would be the better use of their resources? I don't know, and obviously neither do you, but they probably have a better idea by knowing what their own internal pacing capabilities, revenues, and costs would be. If you would *prefer* to see more expansions, I think that's fine, adn you can tell them that's what you *want,* but I just don't see the evidence to make the claim that this would work out better *for them.*
---
The objective will be picking the dev's favourite quaggan. It'll be glorious
---
Indeed. The fact that they are loadouts also bothers me, but not as much as other things they could have done differently:
---
- Why on Earth is there no way to assign just one key press to change both build and equipment?
---
- Why didn't they combine build templates and equipment templates? It would have made the whole system a lot easier and I'd wager that most players do switch both anyway most of the time.
---
- Why can we not select specific templates as default for specific game modes? At the very least, remember the build/equipment used last time being in that mode and restore that next time I go in.
---
- Why connect equipment templates to template storage? Surely it is nice to store equipment there, but the more of stuff you have there, the more you want to have different combinations of armor/infusions/runes/sigils, and every of these new combinations requires a new equipment template slot, while effectively not adding any more storage (as you already have all of that in-storage). This forces players to buy a bundle A+B, while all they need may be A, but the price is justified using B.
---
It's been since 2012 that dredge mobs leave behind an invisible hitbox once killed in instances. Verify this yourself by going into SE or underground facility fractal, kill some mobs, then use an aoe skill in the same spot after they have died with nothing nearby. Shit's annoying.
---
Imagine being on the defensive for anet about this, wtf?
---
F2p can't do gold to gems.
---
The point is, it is a fractal build for CM groups.
---
As said before, the guide assumes you have 100% alacrety and all other necessary boons. Also in fractals you have higher boon duration cause of your Agony resistance and the pots.
---
Also in Fractals you will precast before every encounter. Meaning you will give all your buffs to the group and than use singularity (which resets all cooldowns) and than start the fight. Means when you start the fight your team already has all the quickness for some seconds and you have all your skills on cooldowns , so quickness won't run out so fast.
---
An other point is, that the boss fights in good fractal groups are really short, so you will never be struggling with the uptime,, else than in long fights.
---
For open world, get a build from Metabattle. Builds from snowcrows and Discretize are for endgame content and optimized groups.
---
I am NA server. So looking at the TP, left is the price people are asking for, and right is what I can list the price of my mats?
---
It sounds like we do agree and just needed a few more words.
---
Changing equipment/build by hand is always inconvenient, regardless if you have legendary or swap to another ascended set. I wish there would be something that does this using just one key press. Not even the new system does that.
---
Bunch of reasons come to mind: 
---
The first part and first "boss" are just a whole lot of "Why though ?".
---
The second part slaps LORE in your face in the weirdest way possible, the bombs during the fight are an annoying gimmick combined with mobs spamming you with soft CC and why for the love of god do the mobs even go for the cannon guy ?
---
The lab part is okayish, except the second you're hit with chill or Hamstrung you don't move at all, because fuck you and if you didn't notice at the budget Steve fight you will notice here that this fractal didn't undergo any QA with instabilities.
---
The defend the ship and collect treasure part is fine except the cannons have to realign before shooting so if you use your skills too fast some won't activate and just go on cooldown.
---
And now to the bossfight, the shitshow that makes this fractal so unfun: Each boss has a bunch of gimmicky CC skills or effects, the shark and bomb mechanic can happen to the same person at the same time (genuis move right there), once again you get a bunch of adds with condition and boon spam, most notably chill and weakness. To make this even more fun you get that stupid wind that pushes you into a murderzone which is quite difficult to get out of with all the chill in your face. At this point the bossfight is just about staying out of all the bullshit CC while dealing with the add or bursting the boss and here is where instabilities come into play. I could swear 9/10 times instabilities are afflicted and SA which under no circumstances should be present in this fractal or at least during the last boss fight. Hamstrung and outflanked also cause a bunch of issues but nowhere near as bad as the other two.
---
TL;DR Meh fractal by default, turns into a shitshow with certain instabilities and feels like it never had any testing done besides on T1 with GM skills.
---
It's been 3000 years... Finally made my first legendary.
---
Rewards arent locked. U get them from daily chests. Mastery only gives u agony resistance and a lil help in the fights. U probably be fine in t1 part of it and they arent something u cant go whitout even on t4 if u just spend enough time learning the mechanics n gather the agony
---
Classic wow and FF are not new mmo. The fact that you are using those as examples means exactly what I said mmo is dead
---
 Players are mostly veterans of the genre moving from one to another
---
Relying entirely on new players who have a lot to do at this point is a pretty poor strategy I would think. What you need is something meaty for long time players to sink their teeth into. If you can keep pushing something to get people to log in that runs alongside that, great, but it wasn't the quality of living story season one releases that was keeping people around for the most part. While living world patches might have prompted logins, it was the base game (and fractals) that gave people real content to do when online, not pressing f on signs. If you don't have that solid base of content, people will drift away, and while GW2 does in theory have a base of content like that, it has been exhausted by long time players and isn't updated nearly enough - the biggest problem in this regard was probably the failure of pof to really deliver on this stuff.
---
People often bring up "X, Y, Z is fine" as some sort of evidence for networking issues while completely ignoring the fact that routes also matter.
---
Actually I should have started with that same question. What is the point of this thread? If all you wanted to do was vent then nevermind ...
---
If you start this game with silverwastes grinding, you will most likely to burn out very quick. So i dont recommend to grind already
---
Before Hot released you had just infused and not attuned rings, also the highest avaliable agony infusion had +7 agony and you needed a total of 80 AR to do the highest lvl which was 50.
---
Also the instabilties on the commonly run 50 40 30 runs was basically just that agony pops in all few seconds and nothing else.
---
Sure there were other instablities but they were on the lvls in between.
---
After HoT got released the lvl cap of fracs went up to 100 and the required agony for that to 150. Also a complete Agony infusion rework came into play where you can drop them.
---
Later they reworked the infusion system again so you can get stat infusions.
---
Thank you
---
I'm enjoying the game! breathing fire on everything with guardian's second torch ability is a novelty that hasn't gotten old since I first got a torch, and I have friends that I play with when we do heart of thorns/path of fire content. I just like making money as well, so I'm just trying to figure out the best way to do so when I'm in a grinding mood :P
---
There's a lot wrong with this post.  I'm not sure why you seem so offended by this build in favor of the dagger dagger condi Daredevil when you already (irately) told OP to not play condi and OP had said they don't want to play melee, besides.  But okay, let's play your "DD vs Rifle for open world meta superiority" game:  
---
* Death Blossom is 3 stacks of bleeding, not 4  
---
* Poison does more damage per tick than bleeding  
---
* I'm not sure why you all-capsed *"ONE stack"* twice when that's not how it works; due to Panic Strike and Potent Poison, every shot applies two stacks, not one  
---
* Those two stacks of poison (a) tick harder than three stacks of bleeding (b) cost one less Initiative and (c) scale with quickness, whereas Death Blossom doesn't  
---
* Spotter's Shot is a piercing projectile finisher which also combos through shortbow4, and projectile finishers always apply, making them more reliable than the random bolts flying off whirl finishers  
---
* Is already a Poison-focused build which has huge synergy with Deadly Ambition, which is probably the strongest condition trait Thieves currently have.  
---
The concept of the build for open world is more than fine, but I agree some of the trait and utility choices are not great; you can check my other response to OP on how to optimize the idea, and I would recommend trying it out before slamming it.  I started running a similar thing in open world after being severely underwhelmed by full Viper DD Daredevil.  I promise you it's better.  For open world I've found it goes:  Viper Daredevil &lt; Poison Rifle &lt; Power Rifle &lt; P/P Deadeye  
---
It's not the best.  It does work.  And it is better than condi daggers.
---
That is literally the only real gear progression gw2 has. Did you ever play other games where you need new gear for every new raid?
---
It's not even expensive to give agony to a character especially since you drop a big chunk of +1 infusions on your way to lvl 100.
---
Hot level design is pure genius. You are in enemy territory , something alien cause it was not meant to be walked by humans . And I agree that compared to POF the latter is boring . That why POF maps are only there for bounties and quite none do the meta.
---
But still the game is fun as ever to me
---
Build template could be better and I hate how build and equip are not linked . So stupid to me . But it is not a reason to say the game is shit
---
**Follows Advice**: After completion: **You have unlocked additional daily achievements for fractal scales 21-49.** You can also now access vendors with special items inside the Mistlock Observatory. 
---
**Agony Channele**r: After completion: **You now receive bonus rewards from fractal dungeon boss chests.** Vendors now sell ingredients for attuning rings in the Mystic Forge, which provide additional agony resistance slots on your ascended and infused rings. Mist potions will also convert a percentage of your agony resistance to specific attributes, depending on the potion used. 
---
**Recursive Resourcing**: After completion: **You now gain bonus rewards from Chests of the Mists and Fractal Encryptions.** Mist potion conversion has improved.
---
Also, can you even get to T4 without being able to attune your rings or spend an obscene amount of gold on higher agony resistance infusions?
---
you know that agony has side effects even if you have AR. 
---
Also fractal difficulty is somewhat fine... the cm's offer great boss fights and the other ones are there to do them daily. Sure i am always for challenging content. But i think the Agony system just does fine.
---
I loved and still love dungeons but they said there is so much spaghetti code they are unmanteinable and I believe them .
---
Some instabilities makes fractals plain stupid and unfunny at T4 I agree.
---
At the end I log in just for some wvw and my daily fractals . Great hopes in next episode
---
He meant last fractal released, not Nightmare or SO.
---
First - thanks for especially mentioning the reset.
---
Also, since you are interested, look at how this is used to solo the entire encounter: https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dshyss/artsariiv_new_solo_world_record_7mins_and_58secs/
---
And devs said they wouldn't make another fractal CM ever. I can't recall when they said that, it's been so long. The information falls in the "general knowledge pit" with "they won't touch dungeon ever again" and "the Zhaitan fight will always be as it is now".
---
It is true, you don't NEED a backup. However I've seen this strat fail so many times I'd rather play it safe.
---
Yes, but it just takes off a flat chunk of the price for that. It not the same thing as how the discount on bulk purchases work.
---
Ok i make it short now. Their revenue stream is NOT stable. They declined 25% yoy. Just because it was like what we have now between HoT and PoF, does not mean it is the same now. 
---
The pricings in the gemstore are higher (Glider skins 500-700 vs Mount skins 2k). 
---
If the revenue would be still up to 20bln THEN it would be stable but it is on decline since a year.
---
And why is that, because ppl are loosing faith in anet to push out content they like. And the announcement of the saga instead of an xpac didn't help, even tho we knew there is just LS coming.
---
Also do you really think the revenue stream after PoF was just higher for more than a year just because of boxed sells? It was due to returning or new players ( which now left again or other left meanwhile ) and the higher pricing i mentioned before.ee
---
I also don't understand how a company with around 300 poeple is not able to actively develop and release new content for every gamemode.
---
"Predatory"
---
Have you tried not buying them? It's that easy.
---
DeAd GaMe, amirite?
---
&gt; The prices are almost always based on 3 things: the skin, whether you need it for an achievement, or what sigil or rune you can salvage from it.
---
The stat combo can influence the price too. A chestplate with Berserker's stats will sell for more than a chestplate with Soldier's stats (if you ignore all of the other parameters you cited)
---
Plus, most of the Exotic drops are actually lvl 78 (armor drops at least), which come cheaper than a lvl 80 drop.
---
...and 250 from all previous map currencies so you can craft an ugly skin.  jkjk
---
And it's part of a collection to get the whole bladed armor set.
---
&gt;Ok i make it short now. Their revenue stream is NOT stable. They declined 25% yoy. 
---
Sure, but that happens in the games industry, some quarters are unusually high for various reasons, others low. But their *long term* trajectory is stable. As I pointed out, their revenues over the past four quarters are higher than they were in the four quarters after HoT hit. I'm sure they have more detailed internals as to what people are spending on, which would give them a better idea as to *why,* and also on exact player engagement counts, but I'm seeing no reason to panic just because Q3 2018 was particularly high. 
---
&gt;The pricings in the gemstore are higher (Glider skins 500-700 vs Mount skins 2k). If the revenue would be still up to 20bln THEN it would be stable but it is on decline since a year.
---
. . .
---
Raising the price on things doesn't mean you should expect higher total revenues. If you raise the price on something, typically you sell less of it, and that shouldn't be a surprise. Again, we don't know the granularity of who buys what in what quantities, but ANet does, and they decided that this is working for them and they won't be doing an expansion for a while. 
---
&gt;And why is that, because ppl are loosing faith in anet to push out content they like. And the announcement of the saga instead of an xpac didn't help, even tho we knew there is just LS coming.
---
Again, I don't see see evidence for that. I don't think you're argument is "here is the evidence, and from that I've deduced that 'people are losing faith in the game,'" but rather that you are saying "**I** have lost faith in the game, and therefore I am viewing this evidence as confirming my position that everyone else has too." I just do not believe there is evidence that says what you think it says. 
---
If the *long term* sales figures were off by more than they are, then maybe, but their long term trendlines are fine. I mean, if the game was truly tanking as bad as you seem to think, the revenues would not be in the 15-16m range, they would be like 5m or less. GW2's worst ever quarter was 13m, which, btw, is more than they made in all but five quarters over the lifespan of GW1. Only three quarters of GW1 were more profitable than Q3 2019, and only by a small amount. 
---
&gt;And the announcement of the saga instead of an xpac didn't help, even tho we knew there is just LS coming.
---
The announcement was a huge bungle, no question there, but I don't think any fewer people are showing up for it than would be otherwise. Like you said, they'd announced a while back that there would not be another expansion until at least after s5, and that's what's happening. Will this "saga" system bring any surprises that s4 didn't? We'll have to see, but I really enjoyed s4. 
---
&gt;Also do you really think the revenue stream after PoF was just higher for more than a year just because of boxed sells? 
---
I think mainly it was mount skin sales.
---
Nope :(
---
Fractal's version:
---
&gt; Don't worry, with the new 30&gt; min content (plus the possible grind for skins so you can repeat it!) they will release more things in the gem store!
---
I kinda like it, its like a rare title that only limited people get/got.
---
No amount of money will get you this!
---
This happens a lot. You've a big issue and small issue. You work on the big one (obviously). Then, another top priority arises. You work on this one, etc etc.
---
Meanwhile, the small issue was raised 6 months ago already.
---
Source : closed this year a 2017 ticket.
---
The decline from a 20 bln revenue 2018 to a ~16 bln revenue is not a fluctuation 
---
I am talking yoy not qoq. 
---
That can just mean the player base is smaller than 2018 or is not willing to spend as much money
---
Speaking of the rising prices, that is in direct correlation of what I said.
---
Revenue is same because less ppl spending money but higher prices.
---
You misunderstand when it comes to my personal position towards the game , I still like it , play every day, but am not happy with their idea of what the game should be right now . I have faith but if you see more and more if your friends leaving for the same reason ( lack of replays let content or major updates (e.g. elite specs )) then there is something wrong.
---
Yes mount sales were for sure the biggest selling point but they did not stop making them ... also they started making them in late 2017 , do you think 1/4 of all player randomly stopped buying them in 2019 . Doubt. It might have more to do with a big players exodus.
---
the permanent quickness assumes you also have alacrity, which you probably won't in open world
---
Nothing keeps you from that. You'll get in combat for a couple of seconds and leave quickly since the critter will quickly die.
---
I think it is both. CMs are promptly dropped, raids are replaced with glorious strike missions. The best we can hope for atm is just another fractal.
---
It seemed like that to me too at first and really sort of intimidated me into not getting into fractals. But this last time around playing the game I was like fuck it, I’m getting in there and doing some. Super fun imo, and the AR has been pretty easy to accumulate. My main fractal toon has around 60 AR which isn’t all that much but I’m only on the second tier of difficulty or whatever. Like 26-50 or close to that? Just by doing fractals each day I get a ton of the infusions, then I just save up until I have enough for the +9 ones. Throw those in my gear and make sure you get the triple slots on your ascended rings and earrings. Just having your jewelry with that makes getting a decent bit of AR real easy. -sorry if you know all this and aren’t a total noob like me. Disregard if so ha
---
You can, but it's very hard to consistently do, ergo it's better to play it safe.
---
“Press F to interact”
---
more like 40s if you only get 11 a day
---
Yes, armor piece/back item visibility is not stored in the gear template and you need to change it manually when you swap.
---
Played since first halloween of gw1, and I like living story.

100% Agreed. This is so much better than copying your Build from Metabuild. It would be awesome (but unrealistic), to see a similar series for fractal builds. Or WvW. Or PvP.
---
[Citation Needed]
---
Honestly I feel like only the 3 most recent seasons (2 completed plus the current season's episodes you have missed) should be paid, before that should be free as to lower barrier to entry for new players story wise, and to possibly lure in more purchases of current as it feels more reasonable to get.
---
while we re at it ; your corpse can also do the ball mechanic and if you die during special action key or some leap like dh f2 you keep flying a little
---
&gt;Pick any two quarters, year on year, and compare them.
---
&gt;And that will tell you absolutely nothing of value.
---
Of course it does, that is what yoy comparisons are there for. It does not tell  you that people are leaving in fact but it tells you that people are spending less money. Sure it can have multiple reasons.
---
But then, if you go to say well same amount of ppl playing, but the revenue goes down compared to the year after an xpac. Then it also just confirms the assumption that the xpac creates more revenue and therefore ensures that this game will be stable for a longer time, due to new features they can monteize on (mounts with special skins for it, gliding with special gliders )
---
&gt;But again you use "people" here. We don't know "people" here. We know "money spent." That's all. That could reflect "less people spending money," but it could also reflect "same people, spending less money." 
---
That is literally what i said, but same ppl spending less money is just as bad as less ppl spending same money.
---
&gt;Now that I have good skins for every mount, I'm less motivated to spend on a new one, so I might get one, or might not. I would pay for a good Skyscale skin though, one without bull horns.
---
That is why we need a new xpac to get major features which can be monetized well. Also means new players coming in with a well advertised xpac will more likely spend money since they don't have everything already.
---
&gt;Yes, raids. People are leaving because they added raids. But they haven't removed them yet, so. . . 
---
what have raids to do with that? i am a raider myself and raids and fracs are basically the only things that keep me playing.
---
&gt;But, like in my case, by 2018 I imagine most people who were going to buy mount skins had already bought at least one for most of their mounts, and while some people "gotta catch'em all," I imagine a lot of people are satisfied with just one that looks cool and they can recolor. The sales on those are non-zero, but I am not remotely surprised that they would dry up a bit. Glider sales probably behaved similarly, give or take. 
---
see above
---
&gt;Again, I am just not seeing where you are pulling that assumption from. Why does it mean a "big player exodus" that 2019 sales are only slightly higher than 2016 sales?
---
did you read this reddit, did you not experience like multiple guilds dying out in the last year... i mean lucky you then.
---
We will have to use launch pads, then deploy the glider and get to his neck that must be sliced open.
---
Was it too hard for you in the end?
---
If it was, did you consider going back or was it fun and interesting enough to keep you going trough it?
---
Or did you just force your self trough it cause of completionist state and just grinded it out?
---
&gt; raids are replaced with glorious strike missions
---
I actually don't think they are. Introducing Strike Missions and marketing them as "stepping stones for raids" while stopping raid development would be so incredibly dumb. But then, it's Anet after all, I wouldn't be surprised if that's the way they choose. Nor disappointed for that matter, just the usual bad decision.
---
well, you'd have found 1 or 2 people that would whine it took them so many years to copy/paste some codes, but the huge majority of players would have indeed be happy.
---
Which parts of gw1 do you play?
---
Just the daily stuff, speed clears? Going trough it again on a new character?
---
Which ones? :)
---
Dide note - if you own PoF you DO own HoT. This was changed recently. Gonna find a source and edit it into here.
---
Power reaper is the best open world build.
---
What if they go with PvP or WvW legendary armor sets?  Those don't take provisioner tokens.
---
* Good pve content:
---
\- Fractals (lots of players doing them, should have no problem finding groups)
---
\- Silverwaste (old man, from season 2 but still very active, people like farming it)
---
\- Maps from Orr (lot of people still doing events there)
---
\- Achievements (you can farm the achis from base game)
---
\- Craft your first legendary (you can start crafting your first legendary weapon. Farm some gold, buy the precursor and then gather the materials; you don't need dlc to craft legendary weapons from the first generation)
---
\- Farm gold, buy gems and purchase Living World Story Season 2. Season 2 came out as a precursor for HoT so is the next direct step in story until you can buy the dlc. You should get it. You can buy gems with gold. Farm some materials, gather ores etc, sell them and buy the season. You can also buy season 3 and 4 and unlock the maps, but without HoT and PoF you fill have some plot holes.
---
He was focussing on the PvE set tho
---
Currently going through pain to farm them. Until a few weeks ago, i would just log in for daily chests, and LS story ever since HoT so I never gathered up enough stuff for skyscale.
---
I don't know why people are recommending you Istan farm when Anet changed it to where you can only get a certain number of chests per day. It can't be repeated once you repeat the threshold, which pretty much kills all potential gold made on that map. It used to be the best, but the nerfs made the farm dead. The majority of players who were dedicated to farming quit. It isn't good for long term farming like it used to be.
---
If you are still interested in Istan, then I wish you luck if you can find a train on LFG. The Silverwastes and Dragon Fall are the two popular gold farms at the moment. Also, T4 Fractals are also good for gold, but that is a daily routine rather than something you can repeat.
---
I agree with you basically, but legendary armor also has the convenience of rune swapping for free. That's great for trying out different builds.
---
How so? Please explain, I'm trying to understand the problem. I only own legendary weapons and trinkets and they work very nicely with the new templates.
---
What's the point in legendary armor when the stats are the same as ascended?
---
The level of gear you get from many bags depends on the level of the character opening them. The tier of mats you get from salvage depends on the level of gear. 49 is the rec as the T3/4 mats are often worth more than the T5/6 mats (mainly as most people are salvaging level 80 gear which drops T5/6 mats). Magic find does not affect silverwastes bags any more, any guide saying that is outdated. One downside using a bag opener is that you wont get bloodstone dust, which could be a problem depending on what you want to do.
---
As for refine vs sell raw, you can easily work out which is more profit by looking at TP prices. Generally there is a small profit in refine-&gt;sell if you are willing to spend the time and hold the mats until you get to a crafting station. Note that buy-&gt;refine-&gt;sell is almost never profitable. The moment it is, someone will move the prices to close that arbitrage.
---
You need 12 weeks for a PvE set if you convert all LD into LI (in total 25 per week)
---
Not counting in lucky ascended drops or minis (to make the calculation easy) you get
---
150 shards a week
---
150×12= 1800 shards 
---
A full ascended armor set costs 1300 shards, so just from that you can get 1 set, again without minis or ascended drops. With drops you can probably count on 2 sets
---
&gt;. You can also buy season 3 and 4 and unlock the maps, but without HoT and PoF you fill have some plot holes.
---
You can't play season 3 withiut owning HoT or season 4 without PoF
---
Well thats an interesting way to play.
---
Have you ever tried to roll dices and create a build as well? 
---
I did it on the web skill calculator a few times and had some funny looking builds show up. Didnt level a new character or played them tho
---
Nonsense, they just have different priorities. Raknel doesn't know what he's talking about. As a general rule of thumb: never listen to people with toxic flairs.
---
Here is how it actually went: the entire season 1 of GW2 was a cobbled-together mess of frankenstein code. Anet's priority wasn't stability or sustainability because of S1's temporary nature. It was fire &amp; forget. Make it work, somehow, however, and then nuke it two weeks later.
---
It also burned their staff out.
---
So in season 2, they did like a quarter of the same content, but this time it had to stand the test of time and not kill their people.
---
It was a continous trend to more, bigger, and vaster Living World releases since then. S3 dwarfed S2, S4 dwarfed S3, and we'll see what they have in store for us regarding their 'Sagas'.
---
Coincidentally, the bigger and better the LW releases became, the rarer coordinated, instanced PvE content became. Clear shift in priority.
---
Death spiral that break bar for 100k damage
---
Thanks for your work! I like it.
---
Few things come to mind tho. 
---
* After 7 years i barely know the names of any waypoints. I know i can search for the zone and get a list of all waypoints inside the zone...but i still have no idea where they will port me (besides the obvious ones like Shaemoor waypoint, ascalon catacomb waypoint etc.
---
* If you add a small map that pops out on your search to see where they will port you...well..thats redundant cause i can do the same in game and get to the place asap.
---
But i do get this is a specific tool for a specific need such as you mentioned, a quick way to port to a place that someone mentioned in a guide,and i think it works great for that :)
---
Amazing: [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Triple-Luck\_Tonic](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Triple-Luck_Tonic)
---
Also fractal potions.
---
&gt; Of course it does, that is what yoy comparisons are there for. 
---
It makes sense if you have a very diversified and relatively stable business model, but it doesn't make a lot of sense for something as random and volatile as an ongoing game. Again, there are plenty of differences between the state of the game in q3 2018 and q3 2019, beyond just an assumed decline in population. This is not a subscription game, there is no fixed measure of player population like a sub fee.
---
&gt;But then, if you go to say well same amount of ppl playing, but the revenue goes down compared to the year after an xpac. Then it also just confirms the assumption that the xpac creates more revenue and therefore ensures that this game will be stable for a longer time, due to new features they can monteize on (mounts with special skins for it, gliding with special gliders )
---
But, again, the revenue is still *better* than after the HoT Xpac. It's just barely lower than the year after the PoF xpac, which introduced five, later eight mounts to the game. Who all needed skins. 
---
Now I'm not dismissing that this was a strong marketing move on their part, but it was this feature that caused it, not the xpac itself. If they'd launched all these mounts as part of a LW update, the monthly spending trend likely would have been the same (the quarters of PoF's release would have been lower, but the later quarters would be the same, likely even a bit higher). And if they released an Xpac today that was as full-featured and well received as PoF was, *but* that did not include a new feature as easily *monetized* as mount skins, then I doubt it would result in a significant upswing in monthly sales. 
---
So is there a *reason* why players are spending less last quarter? Obviously, that's how money works. But is that reason "because there are less people playing," or "those players are less willing to spend because they aren't as *engaged?"* I don't think there's evidence to support that conclusion.
---
&gt;That is literally what i said, but same ppl spending less money is just as bad as less ppl spending same money.
---
I don't know, I think the latter is easier to turn around than the former. If the customers are gone, it's hard to get them back. If they're there, but not spending, then short term that's not ideal for the books, but long term all it means is that you need to figure out something that they'll want to buy. Like I said, they could make a **fortune** if they would just put forth the effort needed to normalize the three armor weights. 
---
Do they need to introduce new "product categories" to the gem store? Probably. Does that require an expansion? No.
---
&gt;what have raids to do with that? i am a raider myself and raids and fracs are basically the only things that keep me playing.
---
No, but raids are the reason most of the people left the game and are never coming back. I have evidence, you see. The Q3 2019 revenues are down from the Q3 2019 revenues, and that's why. 
---
&gt;did you read this reddit, did you not experience like multiple guilds dying out in the last year... i mean lucky you then.
---
My guild died soon after raids came out. If I'm being honest though that's likely coincidental, our leader also vanished under mysterious circumstances, and none of the rest of us were really "leadership material." We've still got a nice hall going though.
---
Power reaper has incredible sustain, easy 25 might , almost perma quickness, and a ton of traits that boost your critical chance.
---
Core warrior and spellbreaker also come to mind as they can get a tremendous amount of power on them, and going with gs+axe/axe and a few traits will grant you perma 25might, swiftness, fury, and frequent enough quickness for your bursts to melt down everything.
---
Core guardians and firebrands have ways to boost their critical chances and power, not only that, firebrands can go with power and concentration to become a powerhouse that has permanent 25might, quickness, fury, swiftness, regeneration, vigor, and even quite a lot of protection.
---
Ive had it happen on necro minions too...where fpr whatever reasom, their countdown doesn't reset but everything else does.
---
I did not but thats my point. Shits like that is making me not play fractals. Wasnt instabilities suppose to make fractals less boring so you would want to play them more often? Well they are making opposite right now!
---
* [Map Bonus Rewards](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Map_bonus_reward)
---
* After the initial release, they added 3 new zones. [Southsun Cove](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Southsun_Cove)  during season 1 of living world, [Dry top](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dry_Top) and [Silverwastes](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Silverwastes) during season 2. Explore them, there have a lot of things in them, and dry top / silverwastes has tons of achievements and even 2 armor sets and a weapon set 
---
* Dungeons for achievements, and also dungeon tokens to get some really nice exotic gear, as well as unlocking unique dungeon armor and weapon skins
---
* Fractals are you core tyria end game. Progress trough the tiers, get ascendent quality armor, infuse your self with agony resistance, challenge your self with challenge modes, complete achievements, gain unique weapons and even a legendary backpack/glider!
---
* Create a new character, try a new profession or even a new race ,play trough the storyline in a different way to experience new story and lore
---
* WvW and PvP for various achievements, gold, reward tracks and everything that comes trough them. Just be sure to not play a PvE build inside them
---
a long ass time ago before delta had chance to implement it properly...
---
That's karma for the messy inventory.
---
Not sure what traits/skills you are running but if you run firebrand 133 (which is what condi firebrand uses) with heal mantra quickness mantra and quickness elite ~40% boon duration is enough with alac. But i’m guessing on power you probably run 22X which would make it a bit less than 20% with alac, without alac ~40% again.
---
There's a bunch of salty people about lately(partly flared up by the recent drama surrounding build templates) that seemingly seem determined to downvote anything positive that is said about this game or its people. It's extremely childish, don't let it bother you too much.
---
*..it means this tonic is priceless..*
---
I know i'm late but very big thanks to you sir !!
---
Words won't be enough to thanks you properly ! Thanks for allowing download too, do you think you will upgrade it with new maps in the future ? And also I need your permission for that : can I propose to my fellow french mates who are not fluent a little version with translated names of the map ?
---
...sounds a bit like the old One Piece introduction. Huh.
---
&gt;it's a game for ppl which are skilled
---
Aah yes, thats why literally every content is faceroll easy, and what would be even remotely hard (raids) is being abandoned in favour of afk-level open world farming.
---
Nope it wasnt too hard, but i also dont know how much a good team contributed to it. I havent done fractals in years so i just started with T3 and tried T4 shortly after and it wasnt that bad as i thought with PUGS, actually it was pretty chill. I even did nightmare CM with a PUG group and that went surprisingly pretty decent.
---
So all in all it was more fun than i thought.
---
There's no real reason to get there once you've done the backpack. At least that's my experience..
---
with what Kind of People do u do CMs 
---
whilst i have seen some people fail at it mechanicly the vast majority of players ive seen there learned it sooner or later
---
This event haven't happen in the 3 days I am waiting at the camp.
---
its ment like you dont get any new fractals/dungeons or fractals,but you can look forward to milion strike missions...,btw strike missions are basicly open world veteran with 2 000 000 hp,nothing else.
---
 "The next episode of *The Icebrood Saga*  will introduce another tier for each essence, for a total of three tiers each. "  
---
So if we are getting 2 tiers of mastery for raven this episode, and each next episode well get 1 tier for each essence (for all 3essences)..
---
Atm we can assume we already have the prologue, episode 1,2 and 3 in the bag right?

Yes you definitely can do T4 without that third ring slots. Maybe capping to 150 might be a bit harsh, but definitely can do majority of them with just +9's (15x 9 = 135). You should be able to also use Deroir and buy the bonus agony resistance there , first +5 should be relatively cheap (1000 relics), however probably way better to invest into infinite potions first. Alternatively one can craft legendary backpiece for getting one more infusion slot, or use potions. 
---
So yes, it is a bit complication, but even with 135 you can do up to 91, and possibly 92,93,94 with ease as well. With potion even higher. Even fractal 100 with only 135 AR means just 18% hp loss per second, potentially can be overhealed xD But ye, better to get that last few points of AR somehow. But investing into +11's isn't such big deal anyways, as they can be utilized later for Deroir upgrades.
---
Wow, i wanted to craft the WvW armor, cuz i have the ressources and i wanted to get rid of my 3 armor sets, but i never really realized it before until now that i also cant have 3 different looks anymore..
---
Coinciding with a festival would be the optimal launch period because festivals already intercede in content releases.
---
Primarily, I would just love to see attention to things that have been bugged or quirky for a long time; Arah story mode, some of the gen 1 legendaries, various events, etc.  Also a remake of Solid Ocean.
---
HoT is included in PoF now, and as always, check out [https://snowcrows.com/](https://snowcrows.com/) for builds. Those work also in openworld, maybe tweak some traits and skills here and there to get a bit more survivability.
---
That "long ass time ago" reached from release to the very end of this project. lol...
---
Good thing that fight is filled with massive balls.
---
Magi was used before harrier
---
It's bugged, which means the follow-up isn't spawning. Your best bet would be a new map. That would mean after the maps reset (when a patch hits) or when Cursed Shore is daily event completer and there will be more players.
---
&gt; So here I am, not playing many of my favourite builds anymore (those that dont get used frequently, and are not meta).
---
And I'm not playing the game at all. Build Templates are such a pain in the arse to deal with that I wasn't having fun any more.
---
Id not risk the first ball, but sure, the 2nd one you never really need a bu for. People are just very... overenthusiastic about it... they tend to keep on jumping beside me for 3-4 balls until they fully trust me to do it myself again \^\^
---
the problem with sw is people claiming big numbers  but actually it's not such a great farm!
---
you'll be better off doing dragonfall for gold, it's not only more profitable than perfectly done sw(which is unrealistic in 99% of the cases) but it's also less grindy and has the chance to give unique skins
---
**tl;dr** sw sucks
---
But guess what would happen then, people would complain that these stats are locked behind legendaries. 
---
And to be honest, either those "legy only" stats are useless and wouldn't improve legys at all or they would be usefull and people would complain until they make these stats accessible for everyone.
---
Legendaries always were about the skin and convinience. It never were about being better or stronger than other weapons (in terms of weapon strenghts, stats etc.)
---
a reminder:  get code from giveaways for 10$ discount.  
---
so you can buy the game for 19$ with this code.  
---
check reddit for it.
---
Magis, clerics or minstrels if you want to tank
---
I agree, the helmet would be perfect for my Ranger for example
---
Do you know people who would like to farm fractals? I used to farm 42 but fractal farming is smh dead right now....
---
the other person is wrong..you'll be expected to use the mantra heal to provide aegis to your group in fractals
---
they're also wrong about scholar as it's trivial to be above 90% when you get so much aegis spam, along with blinds and whatnot
---
some other suggestions, kinda unrelated: do not run pack or other meme runes just go scholar, if you're new to the build maybe aim for like 40% boon duration until you get used to it, reflects are super useful in both open world and fractals..
---
oh and congrats on picking a good build instead of trash like healbrand
---
For me they currently are in alpha stage, big bugs, strict QoL downgrades even for people that did not use arcdps (no auto switch for pvp/wvw, legendary gear unequip problems etc.).
---
V1 for me implies at least equal functionality to before, then I don't mind waiting for future potential improvements.
---
You got PoF? Exotic harrier weapons are quite cheap. 
---
For Armor use Magi with Monk Runes, make sure to use salvageable exotics though, so not the karma exotic temple armor.
---
Trinkets you can use a magi/cleric whatsoever exotic backpiece with doubloon, and then either exotic harrier trinkets (craftable), or magi trinkets with doubloons.
---
Magi should do. Is still viable, I can confirm.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/WoodenPotatoes/comments/d5dxzp/best_open_world_pve_builds_suggestion_power/
---
I agree with most your post that there is still lots to do, i just thought I should clear up some info I saw that I knew wasn't possible (I did not downvote you)
---
This. I will never understand people not wanting to know more about shit like this.
---
#IvotedEvon
---
#ItoldYouSo
---
With arcdps you can unlimited templates, regardless of what kind of items you had. That means if you had legendary something, you could use it with all combinations of stats/runes/sigils/infusions that you wanted with the templates. Now, even though it is still legendary, you are limited to 2 (free) or 6 (bought), and that limit is quite low considering combinations. Even just playing condi/healer in PvW/WvW is in theory 4 combinations, because you might want to play each in each mode, but using different infusions (agony vs. other boni) for instance. Add another role and you would be at 8, above even the paid limit.
---
So, to summarize, you can still do all those things, it is still legendary after all, but it is now really inconvenient, because the new templates are limited to such a low number while before you were not.
---
What's the bug? I only played through it once.
---
There are things *you* do not like about the game. 
---
That is a completely different thing than "the *game* is in stagnation."
---
&gt; I will never tire of repeating this, the "Anet is a small company and this is F2P game" excuse only makes sense if you ignore the fact that in 2018 this game made around 80 million dollars and is being worked on by some 200+ devs.
---
And the fact that its not a f2p game either.
---
Thank you!
---
I don't know about you, but even if I am on an ego-trip and do stuff just for my own sake, it is still nice to know that what I do is useful or at least does not hurt others. If you do not even care that much, I am sorry.
---
Everyone at ANet who actually liked and played GW2 was either laid off or quit.
---
This is my favorite "Chrono Power Blitz" build: \[&amp;DQcKGhgaKDsjDyMPawFrAY8BgQFlAWgBsxLtEgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=\]
---
If I recall correctly, I got this from Wooden Potatoes.  Go pure berserker's gear.  Great with GS, you get double the phantasms and they get to strike twice and when you shatter them, you get them back once and you're cool downs are shorter.
---
Be careful: targets may spontaneously explode on contact.
---
The first thing in people's head when they play a game is not "does this benefit others". Most people's priority is entertainment and their own fun when it comes to playing a game.
---
Here's another bit of shocking reality, which you will realize someday even if you decide to ignore it today: every single person in this planet is selfish. Even in your own explanation, you're being selfish. You only like to think that because it makes YOU feel good. What about the person you're camping and farming to ensure they can't flip a camp, so you and your team can benefit? Do you think they feel good being farmed, while they simply try reset their decay?
---
*Trying to find Jumping Puzzles in VR
---
To remind us of an accurate leak? They obviously aren't going to just come out and say shit like "yeah you're getting a mount called skyscale right after you kill kralkatorik and then you meet the blood imperator in the blood legion homelands...."  but they are going to hide the truth under a lot of fluff. It did predict and almost accurately describe some of what we've gotten if you dive into it and pick apart the obvious fake bits from the truth. Pretty much the entire first half of the episode 6 bit came true, we went to the blood legion homelands in the area where kralk woke up, there IS a new charr faction in those following Bangar to go try and take jormag as well as arguably the peaceful flame legion faction, and we did get a dragon mount that involved going back to previous maps to get and it was fairly expensive.
---
I love player made content. Even on smaller scale like a guild leading a 1v1 tournament in the gh arena , or some mini games like asura ball :)
---
Yeah, there still are some wvw eu guilds out there. Maybe try finding some team speak or discord wvw community servers?
---
Do those exist in na?
---
Where is that other one that was more believable, it was very recent too.
---
&gt;haven't tried fractals yet. I don't really feel I am good enough to do that honestly
---
Word of advice - you can only watch so many videos... Get started on a comprehensive, step-by-step plan on how to gear up your character and don't look too far ahead into it. 
---
I've gotten discouraged so many times in the past by overthinking the road from A to B in my various goals. Keep it simple and short sighted to the near future. 
---
I started with Ascalonian Catacombs gear which was sufficient for the first year or so of this game's life. Then got another dungeon set, then saved up some gold, bought this, sold that etc etc.
---
My main point really is if you don't think you're good, start learning from - ideally - your hands-on experiences. It(heed it or don't, makes no difference to anyone but yourself and your enjoyment)
---
Core guardian, greatsword/ sword-focus dragon hunter, sword/dagger weaver, dagger/ dagger or rifle deadeye, sword holosmith, greatsword/ sword-axe soulbeast, and axe/axe berserker. 
---
Additionally look up nike! Gw2 or wooden potatoes on YouTube for recommended OpenWorld builds
---
heads up, there are some smaller details in his builds/gameplay that are a bit off. if that doesn't bother you, ignore me.
---
I've done first person a few times, but always go back to third.  I like looking at my characters after spending so much time on dues and costumes lol.
---
Oh I know.  But I'm at work on a 24 so I get bored in between calls and people like this give me something to do haha.
---
&gt; I would have loved to see Arah before all the ruin...
---
Yep, likewise.
---
Throw 20 made up leaks, 3 will be randomly true. Oh shit, the leaker was right but wanted hide the truth by mixing it up with some lies.
---

---
You can check there, using the filters. What you want for a druid is as much healing power and concentration as possible, and if it's for raids, without toughness.
---
Harrier is the best option as it has power, then seraph and plaguedoctor.
---
When it first came out I played a seraph druid. Full condi, only used staff on flights that I needed it. All high level fractals are basically the same. Shortbow and axe/torch. It's not much cheaper than harriers though.
---
Well there's an idea,
---
OUTFIT TEMPLATES
---
Yeah there was a lot of crap in the leak but to look back at it now with what we know it got right and still call it 100% fan fiction is a bit of an insane thing to do imo.
---
And I only just started the jumping puzzles for the mount because build a grow lamp took a month of collecting and converting quartz.
---
&gt; Legendary rings: Has different effect depending on your profession, very cool. Necromancer version takes your flesh away, and only leaves the skeleton.
---
probably the biggest let down..
---
So the best way right now would be to make a new character with the same look and slightly different name and just scroll it to Max level in a couple minutes?
---
So.. what did it get right? That we got to hang out with the Blood Legion? 
---
Thats about it, and it was heavily speculated that we were going to the Blood Legion Homelands before this "leak".
---
The worst "bug" is the penalty box in party mode  :(
---
I mean, if it's not interferring with my gameplay it can stay here till they fix it. I don't see an issue
---
frozen risen giant?
---
Just use magi's. You'll just have to work a bit harder until you get harriers to keep might up but it's entirely doable.
---
I wonder how camera will behave with a creature this big :D I've never been around Marionette event...I wish
---
Pretty sure you only got free HoT if you bought PoF a year before they got bundled.
---
Read my original comment.
---
I glanced at ToU and as long as I put a disclaimer about Arenanet's credit it's cool beans I think
---
Not even close.
---
Yeah..? It is still like one thing they got right. The description of the Skyscale is quite far off the actual Skyscale that we got.
---
PoF released sept 2017, currently nov 2019.
---
Yup, counting simple numbers is definitely your strong suit.
---
Now if only it could get the WP codes for inside of labyrinthine cliffs :D
---
This is why I did the remindme like 11 mo ago whether this was pure bs or maybe more came to be.
---
I agree with you that it's a let down
---
Yea.. miss her much
---
I'm a veteran (or at least I've been here since beta), and I still see plenty to like about the game. Did you know that there's a whole new update coming next week, with a new map?
---
Ay no hard feelings man :D
---
Got these "leaks" from a friend and was curious as to what the community thought of them
---
I've just added the 2 WPs on that mapp. I've surely missed some maps, so please let me know what WPs are missing :D
---
Anet made kiel give discounted tp use, anet made evan give discounted black lion keys
---
I wager that was the biggest factor
---
I usually just post them on /s
---
You're missing the point of what "legendary" means. Legendary isn't a power scale. It's a status or in some cases, a symbol. 
---
Excalubir is a legendary sword. Is it better than any other sword? Pffft, no. It's just a legend. Just like Masamune.
---
&gt; The first thing in people's head when they play a game is not "does this benefit others". 
---
That's not what I said. I said, whatever you do, some part of you should realize that you influence others and you should care about what that influence is. You should be interested, even a little bit, to know that what you do for fun also benefits others (or hurts them, if that would be so). If you aren't, you are by definition an egomaniac. Of course, if you would be one, you wouldn't care about being one, so that's not a problem for you, only everyone else sharing the world with you, which in this case would be the game.
---
Yes, power DD and DE are both great for any PvE content, including end-game raids and fractals. DPS rotation for end-game is really simple too: DE is basically kneel -&gt; 33333 with rifle, 51111 with dagger/dagger, and DD is even simpler dodge -&gt; 11111 with staff. Make sure autoattack chain don't get interrupted.
---

to be fair, i had encountered more bugs with the current system than with arcdps
---
um, it doesn't tho. you can change stats on currently equipped legendaries without unequipping them
---
It's not just the magi heals, they also significantly nerfed their healing skills and gave the healing back in one of the grandmasters, but it conflicts with the might generation grandmaster. The point being: you can heal, or you can support with boons, but you can't do both (at least not at the same level as before). So that's probably why you felt like your heals were wet noodles.

---
You are wrong. And so are the people upvoting you. Not relevant post at all, because actually wrong.
---
Guys I been playing this game for 7 years and I have 5000 hours. I guess I finally made my legendary dagger!
---
It should have just unlocked for you automatically. Go into your story journal and try starting the HoT storyline.
---
The one that got the pricing for build templates completely wrong?
---
Considering how badly healing skills on druid scale with healing power, I rather doubt that statement a LOT. What you are missing is the extra health you got and you most likely didnt apply boons/heals constant enough to get the full menders and monks output healing modifiers.
---
But hey, why bother actually learning a class when you can just go autoattacking on something like DE.
---
I agree, I have a couple characters that I simply haven't kept up with the meta and all the changes (rev, engie, mesmer) and I had no idea what to do with them in open world. Like, I could play them and get through content, but it was so much slower than classes where I knew what to do that it just wasn't as fun, and so I shelved the characters except for stuff like farming nodes.
---
This video series let me rediscover these classes, and now I actually enjoy playing most of my characters again.
---
&gt; Well then you should have listed that among your list of other personal grievances.
---
What other personal grievances? That is the only personal grievance I've talked about so far.
---
&gt;Nah, the "dead communities" and "dead game modes" were never anything at all important to the game, vestigial limbs. They're dead because not many people did those things in the first place, and most players don't miss them. It's just that the ones that do miss them whine about it incessantly.
---
Raids, PvP, Fracals and WvW are "vestigial limbs"? What is left without them exactly? 2 hours of story every 4 months?
---
&gt; a new patch is next week
---
Oh sweet, 2 more hours of content then another 4 months of wait for another 2 hours of content!
---
Hero points in hot are ment to be played in a group.
---
Sure, you can solo them , with any class even. 
---
But a necro can go full tank -condi with an army of minions and spam auto attacks from behind on his 30k hp (+22k shroud) , while a thief is probably going to have to dodge and block almost every attack and aoe thrown at him trough out the fight.
---
As for raids and your dps , if you can hit some viable dps youre good to go. If you can offer something to the group as well (buffs and boons) even better. Goes for all professions really
---
Nike has a series on open world too.
---
I'm actually using this open world chrono: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOH7GyqKWUg

---
Still can't even craft an ascended harrier's breather. Only two options are through winterberries or swim speed infusions.
---
Same. The day arc templates where shut down, was the day i stopped playing GW daily for hours. I only log in on the 2 raiddays of my static. I was learing some builds to help out by beeing multiclass. But with the changes, I had to throw out some builds, and it completely killed my will to play (and pay by that matter). If it would not be for the ppl in my static, I would have quit the game by now.
---
Get better internet or something. Looked fine to me.
---
Well, yeah, they said "learn more about EPISODE RELEASE GAMEPLAY"
---
Emphasis on "story release"
---
VR in 2019 lul
---
Hey, to provide a bit more information to what you wrote in the description - the damage aura and minotaur are both "unlocked" by an eye succesfully teleporting:
---
If either eye manages to teleport, both eyes will gain the ticking aura if they go unattacked for approximately 30 seconds (so each eye has its own ticking aura).
---
If an eye has managed to teleport at least once, then at 70% the minotaur will spawn on the side of the eye that teleported. If the eye is prevented from teleporting before it reaches 70% health, the minotaur will never spawn on that side.
---
How comes you can't afford harrier? You have selectable trinkets that cost the exact same no matter which stats you get. And brandsparks are lik 2s e/a  
---
If you can't afford harrier you can't afford anything else
---
This is just a fun thing to try. VR is actually amazing.
---
True.
---
That being said some offer allot more then others.
---
Thief offers allot less benefits for the group in PvE.
---
The upside however is you can stealth and run away if shit goes south &amp; In pvp you can build to nuke people or eternally gib them via condi.
---
can't you right click them and change their stats still? Did they remove the initial functionality or something?
---
&gt; You also listed that you "only play the updates for 2 hour every patch,"
---
No, actually I said that they 2 hours worth of content every patch. Which is how long it takes to complete the story on an average build.
---
&gt; "don't personally like the balance and this matters to you," "care about the dead raid community," "care about the dead PvP community," "care that there have been no new new elite specs for '3-4' years and counting (even though it was actually only TWO years, and it was three years between launch and HoT)," 
---
So, if you literally don't care about anything at all?
---
&gt; "care that you haven't had to pay for an expansion for "3 years (going into 4)" and counting (actually just two),"again that you "haven't had to buy an expansion expansion coming for the forseeable future,"
---
damn. I legit can't tell if you're trolling or not, because I know fanboys this special exist
---
&gt;even though they have been releasing new mounts, 
---
2 new mounts in almost an entire year.
---
&gt;masteries, maps, story missions, and 
---
Maps and story missions that are finished in about 2 hours then never visisted again, and masteries that are either extremely sitiuational to the point where they should not even be masteries (harvest magic mastery, oh wow thank you anet so generous) or incredibly banal (and still highly sitiuational).
---
&gt;all sorts of other stuff without you having to buy an expansion,
---
lmao what "other stuff"? 
---
That implies the content they are releasing is expansion worthy when its not.
---
&gt;EVERYTHING.
---
Everything being... 2 hours of story every 4 months?
---
&gt;How long you spend playing it is entirely your business. If you only play it for two hours, I can see why you might not feel that worthwhile, but that's not my problem, or ANet's.
---
How exactly do you play a 2 hour long story mission for 4 months?
---
That's kinda hilarious lol
---
They were 100% wet healing noodles. I loved how bursty it was having to chase people down to heal them. I also never bothered with might because I played back when 2 banner slaves were common and could easily maintain 25 might for each subgroup.
---
Best guild I've ever been a part of! Very accepting and positive environment to learn wvw and make online friends.  Our weekly runs are always fun or at the least educational on how to improve as a player and squad.
---
Content, or lack thereof
---
reaper is super bad in fractals,like lvl of holo bad. didnt seen any reaper for 8+ months. (im doing cms every day)
---
Dry Top and Silverwastes still remain some of the game's best content, though.
---
But yeah, story instances suck. LW1 barely had any, and focused on the open world instead.
---
/r/guildrecruitment/
---
This is a great overview. I just wanted to pop in and reinforce coming to terms with dying. It really can happen a lot and there's no use getting frustrated. Just run back. It won't take as long as it seems if you just get moving.
---
Since you don't have a mount yet, I would highly recommend you play the game mode with a high mobility character. This can be something like warrior with greatsword (it has 2 movement skills), or a herald which can easily output permanent swiftness. Swiftness is your friend.
---
Good luck out there! Hope you learn to love it in the process. 🤘
---
Yep like kinect was
---
well like others said that build is designed around group content, specifically fractals
---
with a proper group the fights there last seconds so you don't really take damage and whatever hits you take will be healed by the diviner rev using soulcleave
---
that being said the build is tanky enough..as a general rule on guardian you want to avoid being hit in the first place(most classes really) and mitigate with active defense such as aegis, dodges, blinds(can run the blind mantra for example) etc.
---
f2 tome is a great source of healing and you can simply run litany in open world! but don't get used to relying on it since it's not really an option in most group content
---
40% bd would be considered too high by many players but since you're new it's better to be safe than sorry! yes diviner trinkets until you reach that(in fractals you get free 15% bd from potions too)
---
as you get more familiar with the build you can slowly replace trinkets with berserker but remember quickness is your main priority and if you can't keep it up in groups it's better to sacrifice your own dps for it
---
pack runes are a good choice for the renegade because their dps in fractals is lower than yours and the fury can allow you(the fb) more flexibility in terms of weapon choice..but as power fb you'll be expected to provide quite some dps, hence scholar
---
note: the minimum boon duration for perma-quickness is 15% if played near perfectly so experienced fbs will run full berserker in fotms, but i'd say don't drop under 25% until you're confident..nothing worse than not having quickness during your burst
---
Stat swapping?
---
Awesome stuff, I await the day all Raids will be considered solo content.
---
I believe I can flyyyyyy
---
Whats your point?
---
Really nice music choices. Usually I have to mute videos like these and put on a podcast or something, but this was pleasant the whole way through.
---
Oh you have it all working with a controller? All the buttons etc? 
---
I guess the other big issue is you can’t see any UI. Shame we don’t have GW1 control over UI elements.
---
I've ran into a whole 3 bugs in the 3.5 years I've been playing. Idk why I'm so lucky but I've only seen the one HP Character being stuck on a rock and not moving to their place to be interactable in one of the starting places, and the Diessa Plains meta being stuck. And then this, but like.... It's not that big of a deal that this isn't getting fixed, not being able to 100% a map because of one of the first metas you are introduced to (as a Charr) being stuck is really bad, but having a silly buff stuck is just silly having a huge problem with it existing. It's not hurting so why is it a bigger deal than the 70 other bugs you could have ran into?
---
aha - I thought I managed to stealth-delete then saw you replied. I mis-read your original post and thought maybe you had controls figured out already, but yeah I've been playing on a steam controller for years and have been adding to and improving the controller scheme constantly. It's still not perfect but I consider it pretty good lol
---
Compare it to what though? Yes its a fun read to see someone's Guild Wars 2 dream diary but its just that, dreams.
---
Hold on
---
Almost gave a shit.
---
I'm the type of player who just kind of set up a ton of raid builds for my mesmer and went with that.  And you know, that worked for everything but HOLY MOLY did his open world chrono build change my life.
---
There is a spider cave in the south east of Claypool (Queensdale), connecting it to the The Heartwoods.
---
Only discovered it after like 2000 hours of playtime :D
---
Save on inventory space. Freedom to experiment with all stat and rune combos without the huge penalty to gold.
---
But even prior to getting my first Legendary set I found it quicker to use multiple exotics for known builds. I still appreciate the freedom for experimentation though.
---
You also get monument claimer from capturing shrines in desert. That's honestly a lot better imo. Faster and more xp from it, and it benefits your team.
---
man i feel your pain.  one of the steps for Bolt required an event in Orr, that was busted for like a week.

So the tittle is in English, but nothing else is. Well.... congrats? I guess?

Not dumb, but lazy. Legendary equipment comes with legendary responsibility.
---
Short answer is yes. To me Guild Wars 2 is the best MMORPG on the market right now. But it does have its faults or rather the faults of ncsoft management show. 
---
If you're looking for a good game to explore and get some good gameplay out of GW2 is a great pick. If you're looking for competitive game play then maybe not so much. 
---
The world has beautiful maps with deep lore. The fighting mechanics are on point. The player base is overall friendly and active. There are still mega guilds like ViP around. The stories veries but overall are pretty good. The core is free to play. I highly recommend at least trying it out to see if it's a good fit for you.

Down side is PvP and WvW receive very little love from their creators.

In actuality most Vistas and Hero Points are neat little out of the way places. Esp the first time and if you are just exploring and read the descriptions.

Playing destiny 2......
---
If nothing else, there's a lot of this game, and getting the expacs and core games alone without the LS 2-4 packs gets you a big thwack of content, and more with those. Given that this game has a f2p mode (the core game, [with some restrictions](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Account#Free_accounts)), if you enjoy action combat (positioning, not standing in the red badstuff and dodge are key parts to not dying!), it's worth downloading and trying before you buy.

I was getting nauseous just watching the video

Won’t get bloodstone dust? I find it way easy to get bloodstone dust when in Sliverwastes. Easily get 600-1k bloodstone dust in a hour.

That...sounds a bit like condition core engineer? Is my guess correct?

Thats my top post today. Someone give that man his gold!

If it helps, WP probably has a 3 hours video about it.

Well, if you think about it, we're all walking around naked under our clothes.
---
How the armors look is subjective, so that's no reason to go asking.  
---
Now, mechanically? That's a reason.
---
To put it simply, it saves inventory slots. Some classes, like Mesmer, would use multiple sets of equipment for different roles, or even different raid fights. [Some even mixed stats](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/power%20boon/) to hit certain breakpoints. [Sometimes not.](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/condition%20boon/) Other times, [they may use even a third](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/power/) set, and these take up a lot of inventory slots. Being able to condense them down to a single gear set is nice, and it lets you experiment with other stat combos on the fly without making/buying other gear.  
---
Generally speaking, that's the reason you'll get. Sometimes people like the skins a lot. Other times they want to be able to swap Runes or infusions frequently without breaking the things. It varies from person to person.
---
I don't understand why this is necessary.
---
Yeah, I'm doing everything in the new maps and buying the things that seem unnecessarily expensive like the VIP title.
---
you could always just stand in the bubble on the ground when floor phase happens.....

I did everything for aurora but never made it because the mats are just too damn expensive. I have the ascended trinket and that's it.

As long as my guild is still raiding, I'll be here
---
Since no one seems to have given you an honest answer pertaining strictly to Silverwastes, I'll try to clarify some points.
---
Open all bags except the yellow rare bags on a character that is around level 50. (Optimal is 49). I also do this on a medium armor character for more leather drops.
---
Salvage all gear and sell the mats on TP. Never, ever, autosell. Always post and wait. Look carefully at prices vs supply as well. If you can eek out an extra 15s by not undercutting because the lowest sell is only at a handful then post smart. 
---
Open all rare (yellow) bags on a level 80 and salvage gear that falls below the going price of globs of ecto. No, it's not a guarantee ecto but I've found that it's still a more valuable method.
---
Use bandit crests on skeleton keys  (I usually stock up to 250) and green bags of gear. (salvage on the 49 toon)
---
Don't bother with opening the nightmare chest in the lab until you've amassed several keys or if you are getting ready to logout and want to close out the night.
---
Beyond that, it's no different than anything else. Sell mats you aren't needing and never autosell.
---
There's an area over the very top of Tangled Depths where the game design dissappears and is empty without textures, with no monsters. Just like the end of *the world*. Bliss.
---
Update on this: Number 22 and 23 have the same chatlink, you may want to fix that one
---
&gt; Remember if you will the bi-weekly content releases, feature patches, wvw tournaments, amoung other things that were happening pre-hot. Some of the most amazing bosses, world events, instanced content came from LS1.
---
Are we remembering that time the same? Because I remember it as a hellish effectively year-plus-long content drought. LS1 hardly provided any permanent content at all (Southsun Cove and Fractals were basically it for a year). Everything else was temporary, meaning that even the rare interesting bi-weekly "content release" would just go away in two weeks. And even then, most of those bi-weekly patches weren't interesting at all; usually they were just achievement hunts dressed up with a little theme.
---
Yeah if 6-12 year old kids get exposed tho those manipulative and addicting gambling mechanics, which many are literally nothing more then casino games disguised as sports games, while the rating system are well aware of all of those and still intentionally give them an for everyone rating.
---
Cause those higher ups in the rating organization are also the CEOs and manager who are selling those games filled with so many abusive micro transactions and gambling that it can barley called a game anymore, they dont give 2 **** about if becoming so bad, that many spend thousands on them and often are in huge deep before they realize the situation, just to squeeze every possible penny out of their customers with no sense of moral and consequences.
---
People like you who defend this **** going on in the industry, not only impacting the game play experience for the worse, but also exposing those mechanics tho underage kids who couldn't develop a sense for the value of money yet and cant defend them self tho those gambling systems just makes me want to puke...
---
If this ridiculous power creep continues, it will be soon enough.
---
I feel your pain. I used to have all the builds, too, but have been redused to like 1 build on 3 characters that I still play. I've been looking at the changes blizzard is making in the upcoming WoW expansion and the fact that they listened to player feedback and improved the more annoying aspects of the game is very enticing.
---
No, I really do think it is inherently bad. You can make it feel like the world is moving forward without permanently removing content after two weeks. Allowing players to revisit content they liked outweighs any and all benefits of removing content.
---
Thanks, giving it a look now.
---
January was the last one.
---
I actually just came to this sub after exiting GW2 in mild disgust; I use my thief for pvp, wvw and open world and didn't realize that they basically just limited me to having two of the modes. And I had just made my condi version of him too. :/ Like man I'm trying to stay positive, but.
---
That makes complete sense. I wasn’t playing when all that changed, thank you.
---
Not only that, sometimes top priority stuff gets shoced down, too. 
---
I am working on an app with roughly 10% retention by week 5. 4 months ago we were working on push notifications to hopefully improve that, but we were dependent on some second party before we vould start implementing it on the front end. It’s been four months, and the product owner refuses to prioritize it. Literally all the business side cares about is the total amount of users who have logged in ever. We keep telling them that we either need to create new features that drive retention, or that we need to prioritize those fucking push notifications. There’s even more aggregious shit, like the app’s supposed "core functionality" being hidden behind a tiny icon that barely even 1/3 of out users have *ever clicked, even once*.
---
Sometimes a product is at the whim of someone who doesn’t understand what it needs. This particular bug isn’t a very big deal. I’m affected myself, but I don’t care. But I think there are enough examples of ANet prioritizing in a weird way to question those in charge of prioritizations.
---
How can someone be not disappointed in HoT, while being disappointed by PoF?
---
You can use autohotkey to remap mouse wheel to mouse click. it's still 1 input to 1 action and saves wear on your fingers (and mouse).
---
FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU.  
---
Extreme enough for ya?
---
My interpretation of that line is you record a single input and can repeat a single input. Auto clicking a stack or whatever. It's to guard against more complex macros of multiple inputs being run.
---
No not yet but I'll give it a go at some point. Tbh, my vive is connected to my laptop because my PC GPU (GTX 970) isn't powerful enough for it, but GW2 is on my PC so I'll need some time to install GW2 on the laptop and get it all set up.
---
I didn't even know it's a bug. I thought I had to talk to some NPC to get rid of them, and consciously didn't go out of my way to do that or look it up since I'm used from other MMOs to keep quest related buffs and items for vanity purposes.
---
I'd give it a 6.5 to 7.0 out of 10.  I didn't really enjoy LS2 very much; the "free" mastery points were nice, but some of the achievements were pretty tedious.  There were a few episodes with great lore that I'd push up to like an 8.5/10, but I wouldn't prioritize LS2 over LS3 or LS4.
---
2 is the weakest in many ways. It does have some solid rewards, like Mawdrey II and Luminescent Headgear, but 3 and 4 still feel like way better value with new maps, along  with the story and rewards.
---
Glenna is best.

Hey bro, I was in the same situation as you. My parents wouldn't let me buy it cos the holy spirit told em not to. But they still gave me an allowance and what I did was that I found someone who's parents were pretty lenient with them using their credit card and I asked them to buy the game for me on cdkeys.com as it's constantly cheap there and send me the code via Gmail and I would give them their money back plus a tip or favor (but they refused cos they be cool, Tru bro I tell you). I'm letting you know something I did cos I found myself unable to move forward with the game after f2p lvl 80 and 270hrs of play. It was worth it. Stay strong and stay blessed from your fellow bro in suffering. 🙏
---
In videogames, as in real life, what is "allowed" is often a lot more fuzzy than people realize. No policy document will help you if you get banned for something that is "allowed" technically. The key is to look at what happens practically and make your decisions off of that information. In this case, I can tell you that I have never heard of someone getting banned for using autoclickers. Could it have happened? Absolutely, but I doubt that it is common, or else the community would know about it.
---
There's nothing ambiguous about it. The policy is that any software/hardware that performs more than one action in-game in response to a single action from the player is illegal. The exception to that policy has been clearly defined as "You may create an auto-clicker that opens or consumes a stack of items."
---
Ooo, I may try that for spam clicking items you can't consume all of, but for the Gobbler it's that damn 5 second cooldown that bugs me d:   Nice tip though, thanks!
---
It is being said that you can *somehow* experience Season 2 story even without buying it, you can join some friend in his instances. That of course means you get no achievements nor rewards, and that you are dependant on your friend to not skip dialogues too fast etc.  But well, it is an option.
---
Season 2 is also nice expedition into history, when not all dialogues were voiced and such. Many things do show its age, but also many things are later referenced from this and for full story comprehension it is worth to go through it. If you have really small budget, I would probably pick season 4 though. Maps there do have somewhat lucrative events and you might be able to amass some gold to unlock something more just while playing through those maps.
---
Thanks for the encouragement. I have all ascended armour and weapons on my main (scourge). I guess I just feel a little discouraged by what I have read. People seem to have very high expectations of the performance of others in their teams in this kind of content, and as someone reasonably new to the game and kind of not fabulous at combat that worries me a little. I will give it a go though. It is defs something I want to try.
---
That sounds less like a fix and more like a coincidence.
---
It's actually been about two months now since I came back after a 3-year hiatus (during which I was playing FFXIV), so in that time, I bought PoF, took stock of my characters, learned about the PoF elite specs and unlocked some of them, and started the long process of making gear tweaks, adjustments, and upgrades. I turned an old farming guardian into a legitimate, properly geared character (I already have a guardian, but guardian has so many workable builds with its elite specs that it's the one class I can totally justify having two of), and just recently, I actually ran through and finished the HoT story, which I had never bothered with despite being active for almost a year after its initial release.
---
I know I'm not gonna be able to hit Icebrood Saga episode 2 at launch, but I'm hoping to be caught up by the time episode 3 drops. That means I have LS3, PoF, and LS4 to work my way through, and a shitload of maps to explore. I also want to get back into dungeons/fractals, but I feel so rusty it's like I forgot everything I knew. Wish me luck!
---
I updated it every time there was a new version. I wasn't the only one with these bugs, many players had these bugs. It was actually a pretty common thing, but nobody really complained, because you know, it was the only option, it was free and ppl knew it was made by only one person.
---
i have one set of legendary light armor. i was hoping i'd be able to have access to that light armor on my other light armor characters through the template system. Big disapointment. And then remembering to switch back to the pvp build each time i enter a match is hella annoying. big fail anet. big fail
---
now reskin it! :D
---
Why were arc templates shut down? As a result of the official templates being announced or another reason?
---
Hmm .... do kills in PvP count for the almorra buff and doe ress in PvP count for the dwayna one?
---
WvW (got gift of battle), leveling all my crafting professions to 500 (halfway done!), completed core Tyria mastery (ground that out to get auto loot for Halloween), so much Halloween... Started doing fractals, did the strike mission a bunch, got some new armor/weapon skins (funerary armor etc) and probably some other stuff I'm forgetting lol.
---
Not really hidden, but the mastery point at the top if the map somewhere in the hidden desert, only accessible by jackal through the sand portals blew me away when I first saw it
---
Compared to season 3 and 4, season 2 is by far the weakest, I'd give it points for introducing one of the best maps to this day: Silverwastes, however, I think you don't need S2 to access it. It is a nice set up for HoT, but it also has a lot of callbacks to Season 1 to the point that your S1 party is not newcomer friendly (I recommend youtube guild wars2 living world season 1 movie, 3 hours longs tells the whole story, explain your party members origins and stories and some shows other important characters that helped in that arc). 
---
S2 introduced Dry Top and Silverwastes, both of which originally were small with added chunks as the season progressed but I don't think you need to buy S2 to access the areas, but if you want quick access to them then playing the story wouldn't hurt. Despite only having 2 maps it has the largest chapters in the playable seasons with 8 instead of 6. Also don't quote me on this but I think there is a chance for an instance to bug to this day, so I'd recommend following the directions at least the first time playing. Also dialogue is unskipable....and need to replay story instances for some ap. You can get mauwdrey a backpack and bloodstone eater.
---
Overall despite some negatives and if you are into the story, give it a go it is on a discount after all. But S3 and 4 will blow your mind ;)
---
that was another bug :p
---
some people probably never realized that got fixed
---
I think there are much better MMOFPS out there
---
The lore and story are pretty good, and honestly when I first played through it pre-HoT it really offered some nice twists and surprises. The areas where it falters imo are there's occasional tedious fillers (especially in episode 2 if you don't do part of it correctly) and the fact that the player character is unvoiced, reducing some of the immersion, particularly in episode 4. Overall I'd say it's a reasonably satisfactory experience.
---
YOU SAID YOU WOULD KEEP IT A SECRET!!
---
Was just asking you if I can do it myself ;)
---
What is Quiznos?
---
Hope you're right, though I might not risk it, a ban's not worth the minor convenience &gt;.&gt;
---
Anya's Strawberry Patch in Diessa Plateau
---
Hidden Turkey Room in AC
---
The North-Eastern most point in Lost Precipice (GH) - it has a beautiful waterfall and statue inside the house with water flowing down it. Only accessible by griffon or skyscale unless the max further exploration upgrade is complete.
---
Yeah, I don't get it. The wiki can help you find a waypoint quickly and then you just open your map to the waypoint and go there. You definitely spent more time making this then you save.
---
Ah my bad. Thanks for the correction.
---
The video.
---
First of all where did you get the impression that I defend this. 
---
I also was a 6-12 yo kid on the internet but I knew what money was.
---
If your kid didn't develop a sense for what money really is and things like this, you have bigger problems than lootboxes. You might need to take care of your child. Blaming corporations for doing what works because parents don't care is kindba like throwing the baby out with the bathwater.
---
Maybe you should advocate for teaching parents to be better, much better than complaining.
---
Fuck, thanks for the reminder. Time to throw some chicken nuggets into the oven.
---
So I bought Path of Fire about 2 months back, and that came with free Heart of Thorns. I recently found out that HoT came with 1 free shared inventory slot, and PoF came with another free shared inventory slot. However, I only have 1 total now. Is this a change, is there something I need to do to earn the slot, or is this a bug/oversight?
---
Technically he's right. If you go play another game, you really avoided stagnation
---
I also recommend Season 2. It may not have as many shinies, but it has some great story moments, and is a blast to play. If you really want to play the whole game, I’d consider it indispensable. Plus, it offers 8 Central Tyria masteries too.
---
explain
---
Not Friday.
---
Thanks :D
---
Never xD
---
Or why do you feel you have to use this word if you know you get banned for it? I mean sometimes you simply need to play by the rules both in game and in real life, that is how stuff works.
---
Where can I read ArenaNet's blacklist, and why?
---
Thanks for the advice. That is all good to know stuff :)
---
&gt; challenge mote strike missions are a maybe
---
Oh come on... how can they be so allergic to OPTIONAL difficulty. Holy shit.
---
Whats your favorite quaggan?!?
---
So people can't ask why?
---
Interesting.  Thanks.  (can't watch it due to being at work, so was curious if we got any new info)
---
Well now we know, first week we get the Kodan strike mission and then they rotate weekly. Like we said. Info was in the guild chat twitch stream.
---
Lots of people still associate Pepe w/ the alt-right so I understand their decision tbh
---
Ah, snowcrows has that benching at 34 which is why i guessed core engineer. You should know before you go further that condi holo is one of the most heavily affected classes for high latency due to all the kit swapping. As fast as you can ever go will be a snails pace next to how fast the bench video will show because of this. It sucks a lot but it's not avoidable
---
Why was this downvoted? It definitely appears like Kormir
---
That is PR speak for it's not happening.
---
the famous table
---
Yep, cuz of the official templates.
---
I know I'm VERY late to this but, just so you know, Reshade, which is a thirdparty software that allows you to apply postprocess filters to you games, is allowed in GW2 but the difference is that Reshade actually mess with the DLL's and game codes to an extent, while this software doesn't.  
---
The guy said on his Github page that it is used to make Dx9 games use Dx12 instead **without** changing any game code, so it's the equivalent of translating a foreign book by using a software that reads it out loud and translate it for you as it goes without modifying the original material, all it does is translating it and then read it out loud
---
Are there more special keys to open chests that stay in your inventory?  Or any other items that stay in your inventory until you use them?
---
From the time you hit max level to the point where you have maxed out gear can take anywhere from a couple hours (all materials needed can be bought with gold and laurels) or months if you need to farm the gold.
---
The only barrier to ascended gear is gold.
---
Just add a mechanic or two, crank up some numbers. That's it. Nothing else.
---
So if your surveys provide you with garbage results with 0% accuracy that may or may not be attributed to your research on esports, how does your university support the data for your PhD?  You can get the same results by just making up numbers.  Or do they not even attempt to validate any data or sources for your thesis?
---
If they didn't give out any extra rewards, that would work well.  Well, for those of us who actually just like more difficulty and find that fun by itself.  I suppose the majority will just complain and say there's no point to challenge if you don't give us extra rewards.
---
As a protest or because the creator thought they wouldn't be needed anymore?
---
raid is something old. it's something linked to a time which is no more. 
---
i had been farming for buff and materials when we weredoing bwl in wow vanilla when i was the hardest raid before naxramass . i loved it. 
---
i had been ranking for the mount cause i had no money. 
---
i had been farming for the nether drake
---
then
---
life happened.
---
today raid is something which is totally alien from my point of view. it's not a matter of being skilled or not it's just... i have no time and if i have i do not want to waste all the evening doing the raid.
---
when they split fractals in single run it was wonderful to me. a whole 3 dungeon in a single run was too long for me . now i can just join for one and leave or just do 2 recs on 3
---
strikes are perfect. i wish they were a bit harder but not hard like a stupid t4 with impossible instabilities combo. 
---
i play mostly for the exploration part . it's single player game with some bots to me to fill a party. if there were bots i could create and use i would not need the online component anymore . nothing more nothing less.
---
time changed for me. hardcode player whatever it was supposed to mean is something which to me makes no sense anymore. and it makes no sense at all. that's why other mmo which tried to be "HARDCORE ONLY" failed. market changed
---
Have you never been on Twitter?
---
Depends on how you define the word asexual. If you define it as the lack of sexuality then your wording does mean that to posses human behaviour you cannot be asexual. Essential after all means required. So to have human behaviour you are required to have a sexuality.
---
If you instead define asexuality as just another sexuality that just happens to connote a lack of attraction to sexual activity or attraction then your wording can allow for both to exist.
---
It's like saying wether or not atheism is a religion or just a description for the lack thereof.
---
If achievements have already been datamined, that makes it *more* likely they're going to appear at some point, not less. This constant negativity about every single aspect of the game is just so pointless.
---
I think they go purely on data and never common sense paired with data. It explains the trend of things getting mobile easy and the player discontent it that. All that low skill casual player data giving them the perception players want more "F" pressing. Casual here btw but I actually play and know how to play. 
---
Can't you offer skins in achievements yet still have the same results of low skill casuals buying it? I mean if the low skill casuals only want to push "F" and get their shiny then wouldn't they still just buy it over actually trying? The answer I feel is an overwhelming yes. 
---
Put some skins in achievements, at least some low sales ones. It would do your PR some much needed relief Anet. Your whales will still opt out and take the easy route of buying them. If you have the skin and do the achievement then karma, gold, some map currency etc...
---
That didn't stop them from copy pasting Conjured Amalgamate twice. Kralkatorrik's Torment and the "big boss" during the Charr Concert.
---
I didn't think 33 vs 34 was a significant difference when I was getting about one quarter of that, and I was going from memory.
---
I can live with the latency induced reduction, I'm not planning on getting to hardcore level, just want to make sure I don't totally suck. Realistically I'm only ever going to raid with casual guilds who aren't going to stress as long as I don't totally suck.
---
People were mentioning that with HoT being added for free you're just getting that unlocked so no extra slot or boost. Kind of sucks but at $20 it's already a steal and you can purchase more slots later if you want.
---
Well if they do this accessibility patch, I hope they'll do it on a selectable difficulty rather than change what the boss actually is right now, because that would suck. Particularly on Dhuum which is the hardest boss GW2 has right now.
---
Yeah, same boat here. Not hating on GW2, but my play time is down from my "2+ hours/day" phase. XIV just grabs me more right now and respects my time and progress better.
---
Grats!
---
can you solo escort next
---
Wait, for real? You can't be serious.
---
That question can be asked about more than 1 development.
---
Oh definitely, its built around monetisation not functionality.
---
&gt; shit all over the rest of the game  
---
AH story is the rest of the game apparently. At one time high end content was high end content...
---
I would like to see a discussion about someone asking things about the game and a gw2 player :  
---
"Yeah the game is free to play but you don't have access of the end game"  
---
"Ah and what's the end game"  
---
"Story"  
---
"Ok but the real end game, like the challenging one"  
---
"... story..."
---
A condition of them allowing him to implement it was that he stop development when their version came out. You can aapparently find hacked working version though and from what Anet have implied they won't ban people for using it. My reading of the TOS is that its definitely questionable as to whether build templates are against the TOS as they stand.
---
Show her fashion wars!
---
How can it be power creep when Left is seen doing around 5k dps the whole time? This is an example of skill and mechanics, not DPS. 10 man groups cannot even do this sometimes lol. If anything, this shows that the raids Anet gives us are too easy mechanically. idk.
---
To be fair to your down votes. I watched the full show. I didnt really learn much else on top of the new blog I read. Actually the blog told me more.
---
A few little hints and previews would go a long way.
---
The essence manipulation will be used to open chests in the open world and strike missions.
---
Contact support then, you should've gotten it.
---
boring af, just like every other living world
---
In short yes, you can still manually go change everything just like before.  But what's being highlighted here is another very clear demonstration of Anet's "templates" system failing to meet the requirements of the players such a thing should have been designed for.  
---
It should have been designed for people who do the game mechanic deep dives, people who have many (definitely more than 3) builds and gear sets to match those builds, people who play more than 1 game mode, people who do both raids and open world, people who like to change the flavor often, etc.  
---
It wasn't.  The system was implemented in a way that financially punishes the players who actually need it, mechanically interferes with people who share account bound gear among many characters, fails completely to consider fashion all while at the same not giving much to people who would never need or use the system anyway.  
---
Financial punishment because 1 build and gear template cost as much as a full new character slot while giving less than half the gain of said character slot (even supposed bag space if you use gear template 2 for storage).  This isn't even touching on the fact that people who really love to bring "the right build" are going to have way more builds and likely gear loadouts for specific things they do. (These are the people who wanted/needed gear templates to begin with)
---
Mechanically interfering with account bound gear... You have to empty the template to get your gear back.  You have to take items in more than one gear template out of all of them (e.g. legendary gear) to swap it among characters, your stat and gear combination is not saved and can not be saved when doing that (The OP's issue), and I honestly have no clue how sigils/runes behave in the midst of all this.  
---
Fails to consider fashion because while dyes and skins are tied to the gear template, things like mount dyes, glider skins, gear pieces that can be hidden are not a part of that system.  This wasn't even a part of what people wanted with build and gear templates, but it's an example of something that apparently got zero consideration to the implementation of these things.  
---
So even people who didn't need them, people like me or apparently you, didn't gain anything anything from it.  In fact, we also lost stuff when they put this in.  PvP, WvW and PvE are all as different from each other as fluoroantimonic acid is from botulinum toxin is from Polonium... Meaning you need very different considerations in your builds/gear when dealing with one of them, and now our builds are no longer stored per game mode nor do they even change automatically when we enter another game mode.  
---
**tldr:**  Everybody, even those who would never ever want/need/use the template system, has actually lost functionality as a result of the implementation.  How much you lost in this release is based on how much you use the game mechanics; The more you would need/use them, the more you lost with this implementation of "templates."  
---
Even though I personally didn't lose much with this one, it only means something I care about more in the future is going to be redone this poorly, even maliciously given just how much it blatantly screws the people who really needed it.
---
I do have a question...are fractals considered PVE? As in are his builds suitable for taking into fractals? I'm not even doing high level, I just want to see a bit of the story that threads through them all.
---
It's a huge disappointment that these bosses don't have CM modes. I guess only casuals get to have fun. Maybe I'd enjoy FFXIV even though the gameplay doesn't seem that interesting.
---
Path of Exile?
---
Are you lost? Or do you mean Path of Fire?
---
This isnt the path of exile subreddit though?
---
sir this is guild wars
---
_what_ new mmos
---
^(don't @ me some anime mmo)
---
My main is an asura daredevil. Bouncing around like a bunny on meth is the best.
---
It usually happens when your ping is bad, like hitting 350~
---
I did and I have HoT now
---
Hahahha... will repost with correct title!
---
Skip two get 4 for sure because of the mounts. Get 3 for legendary trinkets. 
---
Story gets pretty good in season 4
---
I'll have to check it out as I'm currently kinda just starting off my self.
---
I'm considering buying the game my self soon (plenty of things for me to still do as a f2p, maybe ill catch a black friday discount soon), and i made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dwxrt6/just_started_any_general_tips_also_an_interesting/) about peoples opinions on some cash shop items as well as giving me some general tips on the game. 
---
I know you still consider your self new but could you check it out and share your thoughts?
---
Out of the available living story seasons, 2 was probably my least favorite. I don't regret buying it, but didn't enjoy it nearly as much as later seasons. Probably would have enjoyed it a lot more if I had played it before HoT instead of after finishing everything else up to the beginning of season 4 and then going back to it.
---
It's a good source of mastery points as well as the only way to get all of bioluminescent skins if you're interested in those.
---
I am sorry how is it my problem how you find rules or black list? I am not Arena Net so if you have problems then the grown up thing to do is to be responsible and find things out. 
---
Anyway since this is some sort of strange argument contest were i am apparently the one that should solve something for you, a person on the internet that i know nothing about nor am i even remotely interested to know anything about you or feeling the need to help you i step out. So have a nice evening :)
---
I don't recall hearing anything about fractals.
---
I think there is a 50% off deal on PoF right now. Investigate the GW2 website to be sure. This will also get you the Hot ex-pac as part of a 2 for 1 deal.
---
FFXIV trials and raids are really fun, but the combat is less enjoyable IMO. I really want to like that game but can't due to the story being mandatory and insanely boring and grindy to play through, then daily dungeon treadmill to gear up on top of that kills all my motivation for the game.
---
How about the riot from players screaming on reddit how terrible A-Net are because they will rotate them. It was yet one of those blow ups. And they gave a clear answer on the stream and it was nothing like all those doomsingers were imagine it. But do you see the doomsingers making new posts saying oh shit we missunderstood? 
---
And they also told us about the new meta event and about the Boon Skinner and about rewards. I think that is pretty good hints and enough to not spoil it all for us.
---
Congrats, this legendary is probably one of the most satisfying legendary to get. With achievements and all, took three years on and off working towards the goals to earn it myself.
---
because you're new and lacking knowledge it seems like those builds are good but they really are not
---
i'm glad you enjoy them and have fun but they're objectively pretty trash
---
The Abaddon cave is actually in The Desolation, though it's at the very northern edge of the map where the transition point is between river and wasteland, so you're pretty close!
---
Well tnx anyway.
---
I looked around the help section and in short, I'm new and my posts get filtered automatically. 
---
I contacted a moderator to check it out (as suggested by the help section ) so should be fine sooner or later
---
There certainly has been some power creep over time, but
---
1) raid benchmarks (which are fully optimized and assume quite a lot of team buffs so they're unrealistic for solo scenarios) show that it's really reasonable. It went a bit up over years but it's like the average good dps build went from 32 to 34k, the really good ones above that are more numerous (it used to be just ele) but not much higher than after HoT release iirc. Maybe it's easier to have a good dps build that also has some utility / self sustain but that's it. There has not been significant, constant, power creep.
---
2) Zhaitan mission has been specifically reworked to become a story mission that you can either solo or do with friends like all other story missions. In 2012-13, it was a real dungeon storymode designed for 5-man teams.
---
At this rate and assuming anet lets more power creep happen, it's possible that some raid encounters become slightly easier over the years, but it'll take decades until they're actually solo content (other than for a few crazy guys like it is now).
---
Also you have to take in account the evolution of playerbase. World bosses (or "core Tyrian event from 2012-13") melt much faster not just because of power creep but also mostly because the playerbase is better prepared. More people are there. Many many more of them are lvl80 with at least exotic stuff (versus random leveling characters with random gear). Many more have berserker/viper builds (versus all kind of random ways to gear). So even the ones who just aa deal a lot more damage than the average 2012 guy. Many more players also have more experience so you see a lot less deaths from basic aoe or attacks. And there are always a few people going full meta dps rotation, where is used to be no one (meta dps rotations were not a thing).
---
Throw 30 new players who never played gw2 in, let them start leveling their characters for a few days without any contact to the rest of the playerbase, wiki and online community resources. Let them try do down the fire ele in Metrica. And you'll see them chain-die like we did during BWE3.
---
i think ppl are just see weaver going down rly easily,so they dont like him. ppl gona always gravitate towards most ez/braindead/foolproof option. ive seen even 500  kp weaver die mid phases on artsariiv when he got skull or some shit. 8k is like 2 random hits from anything  + DH brinks literaly everything you can ask for,thats why they mega popular and i whoud say 80% of dps in CMs.
---
My favorite power build is Power DPS Chronomancer
---
&gt; Map events are not even remotely intresting enough to last 4 months. 
---
They don't have to be, other festivals and events happen to spice things up in between. 
---
&gt;Oh boy, the same events we've been doing the past 5 years with slight to no variation!
---
Yeah, but it's still something to do when I log in while I wait for the next update. What more could they reasonably do? It's not like they could put out a new update every few weeks or something. If people are "finishing the new content in 2 hours," what game developer could *possibly* keep up with that pace?
---
&gt;This is... BRILLIANT! Simply tell unsatisfied players to go play another game! 
---
If they hate everything that Guild Wars 2 is or ever will be, then yes, it is better for *everyone,* better for themselves, better for ANet, better for the other players, that they move on to something else, than that they continue to haunt this game with their whining and conspiracy theories. These players are a malignant tumor on the game, and nothing good can come of their presence.
