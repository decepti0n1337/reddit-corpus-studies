Idk about anybody else but i miss the nice touch from GW1 where mini's would actually walk around your character and if they got too far, they'll come right back to you. Even wish Ranger pets were like this too. Adds life. 
---
Throw them into maguuma and watch them complain that it's too hard
---
You can already see how many people there are and how many of them are online.
---

---
People are just too lazy to ready.
---
You're one of those people.
---
Update: it did run for LONGER now, but I still got the same crash. c00005 after a while. Crashed directly on t4 frac boss and got kicked out so no rewards....again

Druid is the best buffer. Tempest is by far the best healer.
---
That's actually a pretty interesting theory.

can i join frog PLSSSSSSSS
---
Most people asking those questions browse reddit on their phones, and they'd miss that counter just like they don't see other useful stuff.
---
But it really is - you can use the trail of dots you're leaving on the world map for reference. You leave one dot every second. Head to Divinity's Reach, use any of the six waypoints in the outer ring and walk a straight line inwards. You'll notice the distance between the dots varying and find the distance being smaller when you traverse up or down the slopes compared to walking perfectly horizontal.
---
Haha, now that's going the extra mile! With Old School RuneScape you can even play the game on a phone now—RS, GW2 and Civ are the only games I really play on my laptop!
---
After the BGDM drama, the only addons I bother with  the mount dial so I never cared to risk my account beyond that.

No one mentioned Scorched Earth?! &gt;:(

It's so fun to spam, and you can use combo finishers in it all day.

also it had nothing to do with being homophobic, one of my best friends in high school was gay openly, it was just the fad thing to do at the time to call things gay in place of stupid or dumb etc
---
Because reddit, have an upvote :)
---
How about you just stop giving attention to .... nevermind I'll just take my own advice.
---
Minis should be able to fight.
---
Nah, l really dont trust Anet to keep their tune on that. 
---
I never thought of doing but maybe I will get a few made next time I go to get prints done! :)

Thank you! :D I really need to paint a Sylvari at some point. That would be a lot of fun!
---
Definitely let me know.
---
Taimi is to be cherished. 
---
Rev sword 3, come on now
---
Yeah their magic, but what about their souls (is it even different?)
---
i did, he was afk
---
The 4 day thing does not go away until you buy the game. 
---
charr cuz im a furry ;)
---
I always have time for Taimi ❤️
---
Ah makes sense.  Was a bit confused.  Thought maybe the OP had bought the game hence the timer.  
---
Now I know the timer is there always on a F2P account.
---
Asura, cause it's a fact.
---
afaik all of this is to prevent gold sellers from setting up free accounts for gold farming
---
I imagine a world where these restrictions aren't in place where gold selling bots and farming bots bringing everything in the AH to vendor prices while pounding map chat with oppressive spam. No hope of blocking, where one falls ten more rise up. An elite group of players rises to an oppressive dictatorship where a heavily depritatied gold value allows the purchase of gold far below the gem price which has risen to insane inflation rates.
---
Hyperbole aside. These restrictions are in place for a reason. They suck for free players, but the alternative is much worse. Identifing a bot stops little when there are literal server farms of account creating macro programs churning out an infinite number of mule, farming and spam accounts with a game of whackamole so massive no cm team could handle it. See RuneScape where this still happens on a regular basis.
---
All scythes are actually staff skins. Staffs can be used by necro, ele, mesmer, druid (ranger elite specialization), daredevil (thief elite spec), guardian, revenant. Daredevil and revenant use them as a melee weapon.
---
From reading the descriptions I feel as though I should have got Annual Customs for finishing the (Annual) Lunar New Year Customs achievement, what am I missing?
---
You got the achievement. It's just rolled over ready for next year :) 
---
Hint: Click on Annual Customs
---
It's a repeatable achivement, once you complete it, it resets to 0. Once you click it it should say something like "You have completed this achievement 1 times" or something and if you mouse over the AP rewards it should say 50/1000
---
AMD R9 390, latest drivers. Tried both regular and PS d912px. Both have heavy artifacting.  
---
Realistically, you'll get an answer in a couple of days. They will need adequate proof you are the rightful owner, so depending on what info you gave them, they may first ask for further information. Ideally you want to give them things like real name, address, character names, serial numbers for purchases (this is the big one), the type of payment you've used on the account (paypal, card, paysafe, etc) and any other information about the payment type. The more information you can give them up front, in my experience, the quicker you'll get your resolution :) 
---
If you're looking to get achievements done and there's not enough people sticking around, best thing you can do is make a group in achievement hunter central, or join a guild that does achievements.
---
They helped sort mine out fairly quickly. Give it at least a day and it should be gone.
---
I only remembered I had one when I brought my PC to a friend's house to introduce them to GW2. Had to make another account and  I played Mesmer for the first time on it whilst he took a Ranger.
---
&gt; I'm not sure if this game is trying to annoy or promote its game with its free to play option.
---
Guys, he cracked the code.
---
I certainly hope so. I'm worried they might try and tie the legendary ring from raids to the season 4 maps, and not enough people do raids. They said they do have a full set of legendary accessories in the making, though.
---
&gt; I imagine a world where these restrictions aren't in place where gold selling bots and farming bots
---
In case you don't want to just imagine and actually experience it for yourself .... try Tree of Savior -_-
---
Also had that in Path of Exile but at least there were some ways to mitigate it such as switching chat channels. The ToS spam showed up as chat bubbles.
---
Gotcha, I guess it just confused me, thanks for the help!
---
Yup, I guess I just read over that. It's all there as described, thanks!
---
I was the commander for my first raid. Had a few hours with nothing to do, so said fuck it, threw up my tag, and put in a "Noob raid, all welcome!" in the chat. We killed both VG and Gorse!
---
I mean, go ahead and keep running un-vetted un-sourced binaries from 0-day reddit accounts posting from Russia. I'm certainly not going to stop you.
---
Well fuck you too assclown =D
---
Asura, because we just are, Bookah.
---
Nowadays, I see a trend where gay is becoming something positive (as in "These boots are so gay!") which is quite great
---
I say nay. I have had enough Blespreglers.
---
Most of mine currently live at the Malchor's Leap tree farm. I have others at the tomb of the primeval kings for trader's contracts, the rich orichalcum node by Kormir's temple, the jackal portal temple thingy in Crystal Oasis. 
---
the weapon is [account bound](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mordant_Edge)
---
though I believe you could buy [Cothol](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Cothol,_Fieldburner_of_Severance) from the trading post and unlock the skin that way
---
[removed]
---
[Mordant Edge](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mordant_Edge) is account bound. He cannot send it; you must make it yourself.
---
I don't recall if it works, but you may want to look for [Cothol, Fieldburner of Severance](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Cothol,_Fieldburner_of_Severance) on the trading post, as it has the same skin, and unlocking/salvaging that may do the job.
---
I have a few accounts with low level characters parked at the end of the pirate JP in Lions Arch for silver doubloons 
---
Wtf are these pocket raptors everyone talks about ? Where ?!
---
All of them. 
---
if you don't really care, then human i guess? if you wanna see your character model amidst all the flashy animations, then norn. if you wanna do a lot of JPs, asura
---
Unless you prestack might and have enough dps to go through the encounter fast enough, QB and Rev will have issues with upkeeping 25 stacks of might, unless one of them uses a heal variant. on a perfect rotation, the rev will deliver around 10 average might at best and the qb around 14 on scepter and well.. 0 on gs. 
---
yeah but is the game dead
---
yes to full-zerker, unless you wanna tryhard
---
Minis should be sorted into categories/collections. Currently the only real achievement is to have ALL minis as opposed to NOT having all minis, which makes it really discouraging to be a collector but if you could perhaps go after specific mini collections - e.g. Living World Season 3 Collection, Path Of Fire Collection, Gem Store Collection - it could be so much more satisfying and orderly. 
---
Pretty please, Anet...? 
---
i'd say we have a slowly growing community ever since PoF, slowing down a bit as we approach the tail end of a content schedule, will likely pick back up once season 5 is announced
---
It's a repeatable achievement that gets completed at one. Repeatable achievements reset automatically when completed. If you mouse over it, it should say you have 50 AP / 1,000 AP.
---
Absolutely not.
---
yeah because murder-god-summoning humans aren't that bad at all -_-
---
I ran into an Asura, They called me a bookah, I think they're flirting with me!
---
I want to love this class so bad. Give us alacrity, or quickness or *something*. *something* to be relevant. At least, give us more lightning field and whirl finishers.
---
It’s a crime that core and scrapper are shoved aside for a class that is essentially engi for people who don’t play engi.
---
There’s nothing quite like the feeling of ripping out massive apm and complex combos, and micromanaging like 3 kits worth of cooldowns.
---
It’s frustrating as fuck that there’s no gd payoff
---
So in other f2p games when you enter you instantly get hit by 500 messages about buy this and that, and then 50 messages from trolls talking about things your country would look them up for the next 50 years. This is something veterans of those games grew tired of and either left the game or closed those chats and never interact with other players again ever. 
---
GW2 do not have this at all. Our chat is the same as it was when the core game was not f2p and we appreciate that. 
---
And the only way to unlock trading post is to get the expac. It is a bit unclearly written but that is about it. 
---
Mailing items and the trading post, i mean this is kind of self explained. To avoid bots overflowing the trading post and ruin the echonmy. We are happy about this too. 
---
Ascended weapons are always account bound
---
Thanks man ;)
---
I wasn't trying to say that saurians are unmanagable, they aren't. I was just mentioning that out of all of the other species in fractals, saurians would be the worst (aside from maybe some flame legion vets and elites). 
---
I'm aware the trash mobs despawn (for the most part) if you wipe which is nice, but you still have to clear the ship off and redo the part of the fight you wiped on.
---
While you are right that some instabilities would make it horrible to play, I'm kind of hard pressed to think of instabilities that would actually be "good" in that fractal.
---
You can do both. Your level 10 story will take you around a few places and then when you reach the end, you won't be able to do more until you hit level 20. I like to explore around (hearts, pois, etc) all the places my story took me until I hit the next story. Keep in mind you will get some nice exp from your story AND you will get a big chunk of exp if you fully explore a map.
---
there are no restrictions since you bought the game, aside from the obvious expac content you wont get (revenant class is HoT content btw, maybe not obvious for some) you can enter WvW and spvp at any level  
---
WvW is essentially open world pvp team deathmatch against 2 other servers, map caps of around 70-80 players per server, per map (4 maps)...you spawn deep in your servers controlled territory (easy to see the boundaries of such by the colored lines) and you fight over the objectives on the map or otherwise roam around looking for smaller fights; the farther you get from your controlled zones the more dangerous it can get in terms of getting ganked by enemies...depends on your match up, but typical gank classes will be rangers mesmers thieves, if you see them afar that means they can see you and are planning their strategy to burst you down...find a tag on the map and gravitate towards it, like pve thats where the 'content' is...safety in numbers!  
---
WvW relies on your own armor and weapons, you will be scaled up to lvl 80 for base stats (unlocks your build specializations i think? it has to right? haha) but you will be at a severe disadvantage with your combined armor/weapon/trinket stats being low...recommend not until lvl 80 and exotic gear, but you can hop on any time and follow a zerg and stay in the back with ranged to tag enemies or downed players if you want a feel for how it works  
---
'end game' WvW zerg play builds here or w/e your server does http://builds.vabbi.org/  
---
youll find some core builds here for both roaming and zerg play https://metabattle.com/wiki/WvW  
---
for spvp the metabattle link also does you some good just change the game mode in the top menu to 'conquest' and it lists a ton of core builds for you to try out...your lvl does not matter, enter at any time the pvp lobby...after entering, at the top of your screen is where you can change your build, there are weapon vendors that sell weapons for cheap (the stats or rarity does not matter) and you will need some armors as this affects your defense rating a bit but they are cheap as well...the only thing you will find in the build editor that changes stats is the amulet and rune, thats it, nothing else matters no trinkets no individual armor pieces or weapon stats...sigils and some runes are very different than their pve/wvw counterpart, but this is all new to you anyways so this does not matter much, just read the description of what it does and enter the free for all in the pvp lobby or an unranked match or find a target golem or the npc's...if you dont like a class, delete character, make new class and enter pvp lobby again and bam, full lvl 80 and everything unlocked and try out some new stuff :)  
---
sorry for formatting
---
my main issue with this one and deepstone is that they don't have real difficulty, just gimmicks
---
it's the slippery slope of fractals, unfun and frustrating but not hard in the real sense
---
Scrapper definitely along side core revenant. Engineer is better than scrapper for pve content and scrapper only has a healing build for WvW but u can play healer as an engineer as well
---
Looks like we've already got two races in need of elimination.
---
Am I doing this right?
---
Henge would've been a fantastic experience to me had it not have a massive time gate to get.
---
I understand time gates, but sometimes I like to just dive headfirst into something and get it quickly in a few sessions. Time gates prevent that.
---
Its been a while since I did that collection but doesn't it start with Nayrim in the town?
---
I'll see if I can find some time this week to track down anything in d3d9
---
In the immortal words of the Dark Souls community; git gud lmao
---
Controller companion, right? I have that at least. It helps, a little bit at least. I can try again. But I still wish it would come to console. Another good portion of the reason is, I could play it with my friends. 
---
Great, you walked up and down. 
---
Now to run a horizontal path so we can actually compare.
---
&gt;Bonebreakers: They run you over until you break their bar.
---
&gt;Bristlebacks: They spam their scales at you unless you reflect, and if you don't reflect, you get destroyed by them. You want to interrupt them? Break their bar. But wait... they've stopped attacking because by the time you get enough CC to break them, their attacks are done.
---
&gt;Smoke(Smog*)scales: Evade spam attack as an opener then immediately afterwards throw down a blind field and stay in it. I get the feeling Anet initially put Smokescales in but then realized how much stronger they are to Smogscales and swapped them out.
---
&gt;Stonehead: The only mob of the bunch that isn't a pain to kill. All you do is CC, burn, and avoid the easy-tell attacks.
---
In other words, use CC and git gud. Got it.
---
Bristleback sounds hella fun though.
---
I don't like the Deepstone Fractal much, but it'd be tolerable if the "create a walkway" maze was removed.
---
For the Reef, get rid of the toss-a-chest section and reduce the mobs charging the ship by about half and it'd be fine.
---
For some reason, the last 3 fractals they've really felt the need to tell a story and there's really no reason for it; that's what dungeons are good for. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Both Chaos and Nightmare are great, with Nightmare probably the best of the bunch. Could you imagine the original run up the tower through all three sections being added between the first and second bosses? That's what these new ones feel like.
---
Great input. Keep it up.
---
This looks awesome! Is it just me or does your cheetah look sort of like a pug :p can you tell me the armour your characters wearing?
---
I’ve only done it at T1 and 2 with guild friends, and first time when we didn’t know what the mechanics were we wiped a few times but got through OK figuring out stuff along the way.
---
The second time through was much smoother, as we knew what to do and how to approach stuff. Like, for the boss that constantly lays mines on the play field, we just keep one person on the cannon to clear the area.
---
None of us can do T3 yet, but it sounds... interesting.
---
thanks i also have 8 gb of ram was wondering and for the benefits in fps i have a lot of expectations for this addon :D
---
I certainly hope you're right. 
---
Gw2 meta battle has the build I’m pretty sure, and yes the clock icon is chronomancer , u can play power mirage to.
---
Oof, the m’lady hat tip though 😬 yikes. 
---
IDK what you're talking about, my fashion is on point. 
---
http://gw2style.com/look.php?id=14137
---
Does anyone else think she looks just a bit like Steve Tyler
---
Wow I didn't know metabattle had so much content, I thought they had only builds. Ty
---
I like to park like 15 of mine at the end of the DM jumping puzzle since if I log in a few times on all of them I can basically get an ascended trinket/amulet or another goody with 0 effort. 
---
For my group the number of adds on final boss was _humongous_. As in, hard to actually kill them fast enough, with never-ending knock-back by everything spam. Stab doesn't seem to work on the "blow off of the ship" and it's not even "get into the water" that seems to be the problem -- you've left the square, here's + 20 stacks of random conditions for you. If you have not-quite-efficient pugs you're fucked. I can't even think about what that'd be like with bleed fire + apply random condies + attack speed boost combo. 
---
There's not much space and so much visual shit that _important_ stuff is basically invisible (but that's a problem with all of the fractals and pve content -- random shiny? we'll show it to you, important one-two-dead field? it'll be barely visible, color masked with slight shine to be as unnoticeable as possible). Oh and can't rally off of ghosts. Cause pve land was too easy :P
---
It's like when you have the birds instability and you _have_ to use stupid cannons to kill army of ghost. On-off cannons to deal with bonus damage is too slow. Dodging doesn't seem to work as nothing to transfer birds to, until bonus random mobs spawn on the ship.
---
I don't think they tested it on regular unsuspecting non-meta-compliant speedrunners or developers are basically begging for new fractal to be on the same "fuck you, not doing this shit with pugs" list with 100 and Twilight Oasis especially on "here's bonus 200% damage by mobs". 
---
Maybe that's the point? They don't want regular pve players without a coordination and meta comp (or full multiclass) to be able to complete T4s in manageable amount of time. You can still crawl through it in like 40 minutes and multitude of wipes. 
---
Get Siren's Rift? You start with a guard with reflect wall / Firebrand with bubble / mesmer feedback. DPS mesmers for first skeleton, as they're not affected by the bomb fields if it's hard to keep them cannoned. Mesmer portals required to do the extra frustrating "toss around box in a maze while not having your normal endurance and speed and extra trash mobs that can down you easily" part if instabilities are bad. Got to the final ships? Probably scourge to keep adds with extra boons at bay, aoe corrupts, or extra high DPS to be able to kill boss before adds multiply like rabbits. Got some random "non-healing soulbeast that hits like a druid" or "insta-dead tempest" in your party? You're fucked. 
---
Actually thats the good thing about GW2 you can play as little as you want and you won't be disadvantaged. 
---
Well Kralkatorrik woke up in the Blood Legion Homelands and we know that Kralkatorrik brands everything in his path so you hope is unlikely. 
---
They could make them good by letting us battle minis.
---
For a moment I saw a sort of ram like creature there, like one of those optical illusions. :D Except it's just me. 
---
Great work!
---
Yes it so refreshing
---
Especially for the end boss, with the amount of mobs spawning, necros (scourges in particular) do well if you’re in a pug. 
---
A warrior is good for stripping single targets only; the Winds CD is much too long. Necro boonstrips are AOE, boon corrupts and transfers. You’ll crap out more boonstrips than they get them.
---
And a widely misheld conception: power comps are only faster if you don’t wipe and have to do it all over again. You’ll be marginally slower on a necro Condi comp (vs a single-shot Power comp) but with all the barriers you put out, you’d hardly wipe. 
---
No. I love my engie as it is. Most of the issues are numerical not functional.
---
Guild Wars 2 is unusual in a few ways: 
---
There is plenty of solo content, such as your personal story, map exploration and questing, unlocking skills and weapon/armor skins, etc.  Even when you get to level 80 and "begin" the game, there are whole new Living Stories to see, new expansions to explore, etc.  While a lot of this content needs groups to play, it's ***really*** easy to jump in and out with Looking For Group.  I play more than 3-6 hours a week, but I'll often jump on for an hour and log out.
---
Notably, there is no lost ground in this game.  Once you get to 80, there isn't anything higher.  Once you get that Legendary great sword, well, that's as good as it gets. After you get to 80, everything is horizontal leveling: unlocking new skills and masteries, exploring new zones, completing stories, fractal levels, etc. 
---
What the fuck did I just read? 
---
The cannon before the skeleton fight is to teach you to use the cannon to clear mines and adds during the fight. 
---
However, I do agree that the last fight needs some tuning and bugfixing.  Sometimes mobs stay there, alive, can't be targetted, yet still able to hit other players, and the mobs shouldn't constantly spawn.  They should be a punishment for falling overboard.
---
Why link the same image again though? Of course your velocity is the same on and off the same ramp. 
---
The ooze in Thaumanova is different though. The gold oozes spawn from health loss, but you always have blue oozes spawning that also heal the boss. So it makes sense to at least have a big push of damage. Plus, he's not the end-boss and he has fewer mechanics, and his health pool is actually low enough to kill him in one sweep.
---
If he had even 50% more health, you probably wouldn't be seeing groups ignoring gold oozes.
---
it's not the same image, i added a line for movement on even ground. my derp and ultimately error was thinking in terms of momentum, expecting i should be faster on a decline than on an incline, thus missing the original point.
---
I'm late to the party but holy crap, everything is so much smoother; and my PC isn't exactly low tier. 6700k and gtx970, the difference is mostly felt in crowded areas for me.
---
I'm sorry you had to go through the bit of drama. I understand why it happened, and I don't think anyone was in the wrong (expect for the possible insults that might have been thrown at you). People were right to be careful, and you had the right to be a bit offended.
---
Regardless, thank you for all your hard work. This is by far the best gw2 "mod" that I've seen to date. I hope you'll indulge us with continued work on it.
---
Cheers!
---
"quick" this is better than my life's work 
---
Nope, you can try running the game with everything on low, but I doubt it won't crash sometimes
---
Yes, because everyone playing this game is also on reddit. So it’s a reliable way of telling this games population! What great times we live in!
---
I don't think this fractal is that bad, frankly, it's just really punishing if group DPS is low and one or two players aren't on top of their footwork. My pug today breezed through the daily, but out of curiosity I've also joined some random groups here and there that were stuck on the fractal and having trouble clearing, and a lot of the struggle seems to originate from people who get overwhelmed by the mobs/aoes and panic. This happens during the midboss skeleton fight (the longer that fight goes on the harder it gets, so you want good DPS to burst him down, otherwise mobs will swarm your cannon person and bomb aoes will therefore multiply unhindered) and the final boss fight primarily. You see this same phenomenon with the Deepstone final boss as well, if players have bad positioning and never dodge, it becomes a chain reaction of players who need ressing.
---
Unfortunately a lot of T4 pugs these days play with the mentality of just facetanking things and letting the druid take care of it, but in Siren's Reef, instabilities depending, a single druid cannot provide the amount of constant healing necessary. I've seen some shockingly bad gameplay from people just standing in everything and never dodging or repositioning (especially just standing in mines when there's free space available and being all pikachu.jpg when they go down). To be honest, for these groups I'd suggest running two healers (+3 DPS). That's usually enough to drag them through it.
---
I think the most annoying instability in this fractal for me so far is Birds; aside from the general wasting a dodge + adding extra mobs, it forces players off the cannons which can snowball quickly.
---
"k"
---
Sylvari, because they glow and we all know the real endgame in any mmo is to be as glowy as possible.
---
I dunno we did it super quick today didn't we? Might be because of the ridiculous cleave and condi cleanse though idk, past experiences pugging have been absolutely dreadful. It's way easier when you bring boonrip, healing and condi cleanse. Scourge has the added benefit of being able to drop a shade on either end of the ship and just hit everything at once, so mobs just melt without even being targetted. 
---
I think I'm just going to start running scourge on T4 Sirens from now on. 
---
Best comp for this is two support as in a druod and scourge, a chono and two condi dps scourges. The barrier, condi removal and constant epis made it much easier than other groups ive been in.
---
It can take that long with pugs
---
It was interesting the first time through, but now it just feels like a chore. No one really wants to do it anymore when it's on the dailies.
---
Really seems like they're designing fractals with the wrong thing in mind - and that is fun, repeatable content. Not "oh look how many annoying mechanics and mobs we can throw at you at once".
---
Forums, major cities in game, /r/guildrecruitment 
---
Teach us your spellbreaker high DPS ways?
---
I've run into mnf players (Rubik) in no essence 100 cm runs lol! 
---
Fabulous
---
I have the vast majority of my alts at the malchors leap wood nodes.
---
And if you notice the non ramp movement is... faster! (9 dots vs 10).
---
Core Revenant is awkward because Revenant was made with/alongside Herald. It was never it's own entity before Herald and the elite spec defined it originally.
---
IDK if you're kidding or not but you juice them and shoot them via cannon.
---
It's a cruel world
---
It can take anywhere between a day to a week. I've had this happen to me twice. The first was unlocked in a matter of hours, the next was 3 days. Just gotta wait a see.
---
Well.. he is dead *pun intended*
---
Ok. First of all scythes are skinned staves in this game. don't ask me why.
---
I'm also guessing you'd want to use them as melee, so that narrows down your choices to two classes and elite specialization: Daredevil (via thief) and revenant (new class with HoT expansion.
---
Hope it helps.
---
I really upvoted. I knew you were kind of sarcastic and i wanted to "balance" your downvotes. :-)
---
Thanks for explanations.
---
Must be the hour you play
---
Fantastic mock-up.
---
Now, if only ArenaNet would just limit hiding minis during high pop instances to everyone else's but the player's own mini.
---
i've never had a serious problem with this fractal with either pugs or  the regular couple of people i usually run with....
---
the only times i've ever seen a wipe in this fractal is in the last boss when dumb people leave the ship to pick the 2nd chest before cleaning up the adds before going, since they leave only 2 people dealing with them and then get no cannon support since the cannon people are dealing with the mess those idiots left behind.
---
and even then after that wipe you never get a 2nd one since the fractal forces you to clear the ship of mobs before allowing you to continue.
---
hell even one time i got a random pug that went into the maze and decided it would be a great idea to trigger ALL the mob spawning circles. it was a mild annoyance at worst.
---
I can't argue much with what you say, I too wouldn't mind storytelling but only if it's done unobtrusively.   
---
A good example is "Arkk's arc". Arkk doesn't interfere much in either Chaos or Nightmare, but then we get to Shattered Observatory and Yokko with a monologue at the start of Skovald, a silly three island jaunt, slight delay at the end of Verastra, a delay until Yokko catches up with us and asks us if we're ready, then we have to wait until after she challenges Arkk. It's just delay after delay.

True

where as i am an older gamer, i started playing on a commodore vic 20, then the commodore 64 and evolved from there always with a keyboard and mouse. i have never owned a console and the few times i attempted to use a joystick or controller i was frustrated and threw them.
---
&gt; My main argument is that the rewards for Siren's Reef do not accurately represent the level of difficulty and time required to complete it.
---
Ill be honest here, if that is your main point and the message you want ppl to take from your post you should have made that clearer. Your post reads to me like someone bitching about content they cant faceroll thru in 5min so its bad and not worth doing. I am not passing judgement or some shit but thats is the impression your post left me with.
---
ReShade probably not, other stuff more likely if others dps add compatibility for it
---
The beauty of this game is that there are no wrong choices, don’t stress over spending hero points, your build or missions. Try everything, do everything, talk to everyone or to no one. Just do what you find fun.  
---
What is a qb? I can't figure it out.
---
I think if we're talking about classes as a whole then Rev overall has always been the least played, probably owing to the fact it's the only class tied to an expansion.
---
Before PoF I may have also said Engi, but a lot of people bandwagoned onto Holosmith which barely resembles core Engi in play style but it bloats the numbers of engis nonetheless. 
---
If there's a group it's much easier to interrupt. 
---
I recently went back to it for HoM points. I got my heroes and absolutely blazed through the game. No mechanical skill required at all like in other MMOs. You're just severely overestimating the difficulty of a game with only 8 skills on your skillbar and which has AI made specifically to carry you in absence of actual players. It's really not hard at all, you just set up a build and since they're all easy to play you can easily just walk into a mission and win, even on hardmode. There's just no challenge, it's like GW2 dungeons except that it doesn't get more fun or better later with Fractals and Raids.
---
What body type looks best for Norn for higher level warrior? Can't decide. 
---
It was 100% designed with elite specs in mind. There's simply no synergy you can find in 3 core trait lines that is any good. You always take Invocation, then most of the trait lines left feel like they were designed to be mutually exclusive as they all have a real purity of purpose type thing.
---
I *guess* Retribution can be taken alongside anything because survivability is always useful, but there's just zero actual synergy there. The trait lines are all self contained except Incocation, it's designed so you take it + one other + elite spec no matter what build you play (power\condi\support). 
---
I haven't played siren's or deepstone but people aren't really selling me on them. 
---
So you don't see core Guard? Really?
---
Core Ranger is also easily viable. 
---
I mean there are guides and videos out there like the ones on [dT](https://discretize.eu/fractals), besides that getting real practice means joining a group or forming your own.
---
If everyone did that we would have Gary any Reddit posts 🤣
---
[Here is a good list](https://discretize.eu/guides/consumables) of all the meta fractal ones (each links to the wiki on how to get it). [Dulfy also has an older list](http://dulfy.net/2013/01/16/gw2-useful-and-fun-consumables-guide/) that includes some others.
---
Something like [this build](http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/?vZEQNAoaVlsMhSnY5Tw7JwwGHIFFvBCgFwnD3QP0DhMILB-TFyGABAcIAwTJYsq/wy+DvqP4XlfEcGAI+BAEAABwRP6RP6RPaH9oH9oH9ojBwM-w) still works in WvW, you just "heal" them when they are down ;)
---
And gear "grinding" is somewhat enjoyable too if you even need ascended gear. You know that you can work towards it at your own pace and no better gear is gonna come out than that. 
---
Quickbrand, a firebrand that stacks tons of boons, most notably quickness. Used in conjunction with a revenant that can spam alacrity, they can replace a chrono while still doing respectable damage.
---
&gt;Until they reveal it, it'll be an eternal mystery...
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(logic)
---
Gotcha, well thanks for the explanation!
---
if they could be near my character when I move that would be nice as well, instead of trailing 500 feet behind me, occasionally teleporting closer 
---
In a raid environment up until a month or two before the last wing came out, Heal Tempest was recognized as a non-optimal but viable option when you needed sustained healing over time, instead of the healing bursts that the druids are so good at.
---
I haven't raided since though, so I don't know if the meta has shifted. 
---
I remember the build though, here it is: 
---
Water 133, Arcane 211, Tempest 123. Wash the Pain Away, Fire Shout, Water Shout, Earth Shout, Rebound.
---
Full Magi was standard, you could also use Cleric's pieces as long as you didn't steal aggro from tank (once again, that's a raid thing)
---
Sigils of Water and Transference. Monk Runes.
---
The traits saw slight variations depending on situation, mainly Eye of the Storm vs Unstable Conduit.
---
Again, I don't know if the meta has shifted, but it should still work pretty damned well. You basically camp water, overload when healing is needed and use the shouts off CD, except for Rebound obviously.
---
Your damage will be 0, but it'll be damned near impossible to kill anyone that hugs you if you time your stuff right. This build wasn't used very much in raids because the druids simply bring a lot more buffs alongside their healing, but it doesn't mean it doesn't work. It just does thing slightly different.
---
Personally I love playing this build. It's fun and easy. Just don't expect every group to welcome you with open arms.
---
I'd like them to ad somekind of minigame like polymog into the game giving us a way to show off miniatures while fighting with them and stuff. Maybe give em different stats so it makes sense to get that rare mini and wipe the floor with your friends while you wait for a world boss or the meta.
---
And yeah i realize thats a lot of work but it would make selling Minis easier too so it's a win win maybe?
---
reskin and use it?
---
It's funny that not dying to pocket raptors is "more advanced combat".
---
If you want to test OP's question you compare the following:
---
1.Glide down leaning forward
---
2. Run down with swiftness
---
Can confirm: Deepstone over Siren's *any* day.
---
Mesmer has 2 things to watch for :
---
- Clones running at yu fullspeed suicide mode
---
- Gs animation for Phantasmal Berserker
---
These two skills are their hardest hitting attacks so dodging them buys some time to retaliate.
---
If you're elitist against engi, why bother with ele? In the current state, tempest' main advantage is stopping staff thief. Or being reasonably effective for bad players. 
---
Overloads in corrupt meta are super unreliable. The boons got nerfed significantly and damage prevention (fb) is plain better than overheal. Condies aren't as big of an issue anymore AND scrapper still does it better. You can get its CC on a DPS weaver and actually have good DPS on top. 
---
Not to mention every time i see tempest gameplay they appear to be spamming all their buttons rather than actually doing support rota's.
---
&gt; does that mean a ranger can do condi dps, power dps and healing?
---
Indeed it does!
---
With Path of Fire and the Soulbeast elite spec you can play [Condi Soulbeast](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/ranger/soulbeast/condition/) (I would recommend the double shortbow version as it is extremely beginner friendly and almost impossible to mess up on most bosses) or [Power Soulbeast](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/ranger/soulbeast/power/) which has a huge burst and a simple loop rotation.
---
Both of these builds can take 1 spirit to help the druid(s) if needed for a rather small DPS loss. Both of these builds are between good (enough) and very efficient in raid depending on the boss (I would not recommend taking a Power Soulbeast on Matthias for example but a Condi Soulbeast can work nicely there while not being as good as a Mirage).
---
Tell to everyone about this tale, they must know!
---
I envy You. Last season when i tried to secure my spot on leaderboard i played versus a certain guy who would afk after losing first teamfight and flame his teammates. Out of 4 matches i played with/against him, he afked every single time. I still can't believe that he kept his spot in top 250 with that attitude. That's just one of examples, there was more all over plat 2 and 3.  Then i started blocking and 'dodging' trolls/afkers. Needles to say i spent more time in lobby waiting for them to join a match than actually playing pvp.  All we need is Anet to start giving them dishonor for long periods of time, maybe even whole season, so they think twice next time.
---
I'm thinking of building a Healer Tempest at the moment. What Exotic gear or stats should I be looking to get for that spec before I go get Ascended gear? 
---
I wonder if they should have a gear inspection in a cosmetic endgame mmo.
---
thank you! im so happy about that, because i made a ranger mainly for playing druid, but its good to know i can branch out! 
---
also unrelated is it possible to get full ascended gear if i just have 1 character? can i somehow buy all the things i cant craft? 
---
Probably because he's supposed to be one of the smallest dragons, and Kralkatorrik should be larger than what Primo is even at this comparison.
---
&gt; also unrelated is it possible to get full ascended gear if i just have 1 character?
---
For a ranger a bit tricky as you need gear from more than 2 crafting professions. Leatherworking, Weaponcrafting, Huntsman and for druid Artificing.
---
Cries! Getting that set for my heal necro is going to suck then.
---
damn. can i buy any ascended pieces somehow? enough to not need a whole other character? 
---
Frankly I completely disagree. The dinos are easy to deal with especially if you've played hot. If you haven't then its a couple downs until you figure it out. The skeleton fight with the landmines is a bit annoying at times but nothing crazy. The chests do take long and I don't like slowdowns in general but that's personal taste. The only problem is the last boss which I feel like is only a problem on t1( overtuned for that level). Other than that the fractal seems fine to me. Also plan around the instabilities, don't just try to outnumber them.
---
Agreed - it's an option to preview, but not intended for anyone's actual longterm gameplay. If anything, they might want to annoy you just a bit to convince you to go buy. 
---
Once you've bought the game (and expansions, if you want), there's no monthly subscription fee and things on the gemstore are cosmetic / quality-of-life. That is rather rare in an MMO.
---
It'd be very unlogical for there not to be any brand. I hope there is brand to make the map a bit more interesting than it used to be in GW1.
---
I think I did well for 4h of sleep xD
---
I'd change it but it sounds mysteriously obscure enough to be left as is ;)
---
This is exactly what wow does with mounts 
---
Fair
---
Reminds me of the day one DSFix for Dark Souls on PC.
---
Disable full screen optimization
---
Meanwhile, GW1 lacks mechanics almost completely. It's just a matter of take the right skills and faceroll.
---
GW2 raids still are harder content than GW1 even had at least. 
---
It will depend on how much you want to only put stuff on 1 character and what builds you want to do. You play Ranger so you're gonna need to level Leatherworker, then if you want to gear Druid you need Artificer + Weaponsmith + Huntsman, for Condi SB you need Huntsman (for the double shortbow build) and for Power SB you need at least Weaponsmith. However you can only have 2 crafting disciplines by default, but youcan have up to 4 thanks to the [Additional Crafting License](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Additional_Crafting_License) gemstore item. And you will need those 4 licenses to craft everything on 1 character.
---
Some things you can't really buy if you want to have full ascended gear and don't have a good enough supply of Magnetite Shards from raid because even the [Grandmaster Marks](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Grandmaster_Mark) requires you to craft them. You could try to rely and random drops from fractals and such but that's not a consistent source of gear imo.
---
What you can do though, since you mostly wanna play 1 class, is use your other character slots (or at least 1 of them) to level up the 2 other crafting professions you need and that will give you free levels if you end up wanting to play this class in the future.
---
6 and 8 is almost the same.
---
4 and 6 is also almost the same.
---
2 and 4 is also almost the same.
---
Therefore 0 and 2 are also almost the same.
---
Conclusion? Send me your queen bees. It will look almost the same anyway.
---
Some stones better left unturned

---
Probably nobody else other than you will notice the difference in game. Might as well just raise the contrast on your screen.
---
No difference, both 6 and 8 are cancer.
---
Not really all the methods of obtaining Ascended gear are mostly account-bound (you may have a few achievements where you could "buy" stuff to get 1 Ascended Armor piece/Weapon and transform it in the forge but that's not really a reliable way to get Ascended gear.
---
You can get some weapons through [Elite Specialization collection](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Elite_specialization_equipment): for example you can get a Warhorn from Tempest, Staff from Druid, Axe from Firebrand/Mirage, Sword from Holosmith/Weaver, Greatsword from Reaper, 1 Shortbow from Renegade. You would have to level up each class to 80, complete the elite specialization(s) you need and do the parts of the collections only this class can do (for example explore a HoT map with Tempest or kill a Cafeinated Skritt with Weaver) before you can delete them. So it's not impossible but it's very time consuming imo.
---
like i said, there were numerous patches rolling one after another, and i gave some various explanations to how the textures which are on the client side could got corrupted.
---
But you are convinced that every time some people have a problem it has to be anets fault. 
---
Yet somehow the number of people NOT experiencing it,including my self makes it less and less likely that its anets fault...which we should all have if it comes from anets side which we are all connected with no?
---
Remember when anet made a mistake and added elonian desolation wurms into core tyria  before PoF? Remember how we ALL downloaded that mistake texture and we had desolation wurms in TA and jungle wurms?
---
For the last time, textures are on client side. Why they dont load properly  can happen because of many different issues. 
---
Remember we re all playing with an up to date version of the game, so nobody is playing on a old version with bad texture that anet somehow changed for everyone with their servers
---
2015 me would have loved to hear this. That first encounter with those mini-devils game me PTSD.
---
tipping your hat is used by more ppl then fedora neckbeards ma dude.
---
Getting +10fps near the bank in Lion's Arch on max settings is amazing, i will use this addon despite random crashes(which is rather rare, so they don't bother me that much). The only thing i notice constantly is the far edge of the map is always bright orange, even reinstalling didn't help. Also Black shade around character in some situations, but it's not bothering me that much. Imrpoved performance is worth it.
---
Polymock or riot.
---
Yeah, it's not so much that kits are underpowered because they let engis  have over two sets of weapon skills. Necromancers have four (two weapons, death shroud, and lich form), while elementalists can have access to a whopping eight sets (four attunements plus four conjured weapons) at once. If the problem really is access to all those skills, maybe they should take a page from eles and add a cooldown (like attunements, or really any weapon swap). 
---
But yeah, the problem isn't so much engineers needing to be weaker to prevent them from becoming OP, and moreso that their numbers are so low and they don't really have a niche. Right now, core engi and scrappers just do what other classes already do, but worse.
---
*illogical
---
After doing some measurements, I find that the horizontal gliding speed is 294 units per second, and 390 units per second while gliding.
---
It's actually faster than running, even with swiftness. Other measurements show that when you run up or down a slope, your total speed (horizontal + vertical) stays at 294/391 (wihout/with swiftness) units per second. As a consequence, the horizontal speed is less than the one of flat ground.
---
Back in my day we used magnets on our screen to see fancy stuff
---
january is a time of month where a lot of uni people have midterms and lots of irl stuff. just wait and see after it passes
---
I had a similar situation even before the patch. The chests in Palawadan were fine, but the ones outside of the great hall were already opened. Granted, I did arrive late to GH occasionally (usually just before or during Amala), but I'm pretty sure there were times I've been there from the start and they were already opened.
---
thank you! 
---
yeah i was considering using the lvl 80 boost on an alt friday when i buy the expansions just for the extra crafting, but also something i could use in raids and fractals when i get my ranger geared out
---
Thanks! I'll message him.
---
Can somebody explain a PC/I
---
Forgot to mention that I tried that too, with no luck. Appreciate the suggestion though.
---
You can go for Full Magi without thinking about it too much. It's rather cheap to get either from Karma vendors in Orr. For the armor you can invest a bit of time (30 minutes per day for 3 days roughly) to run 7 AC dungeon paths (do each path only once per day and you can skip p3 after the 1st day cuz it has a pretty boring timegated event in it) to get Exotic Magi Armor with Monk Runes already on it that you can later salvage (with Black Lion Salvage Kit) when you wanna transfer them to your Ascended Armor.
---
me too, have been like that for the past week
---
And here you get a down vote for being the troll :)
---
Core Guardian has very high survivability and decent range weapons that can root, wall off enemies entirely and protect/buff/heal yourself and everyone around you.
---
Dragonhunter is basically the same but gets access to longbow which plays a lot like ranger's longbow and they also get traps which you can just stack in one place and lure enemies into.
---
Not to mention the virtues which are passive buffs which give damage, healing and aegis/blocks.
---
I think we just need some time to learn it. I remember people dreading Twilight Oasis
---
&gt;bably nobody else other than you will notice the difference in game. Might as w
---
Im asking seriously :( Wondering if 6 vs 8 really makes a difference
---
A key bind for the miniature toggle checkbox would be nice. Similar on outfits too. We did ussd to have a town clothes button
---
Try deleting the .ini file. I had a problem like this a while ago, and deleting it fixed it. You can also just rename it as a backup. 
---
yes
---
First of all, whether they have more expansions or not doesn't change the fact that there's a loyal stable population. That much is fact.
---
We know from other games and other information out there that a good percentage of people don't spend a lot of cash shops. No one ever said there was a 1:1 correlation. But a successful game is a successful game nonetheless.
---
Anyone who's played the game can tell you the game is busy. Everywhere I go I see players. Anything I want to do I find players. And I'm a guy who goes off the beaten path a lot.
---
Let's pretend they did just cash in on things like mount skins. To sell 5 million dollars in mount skins, you'd STILL need an active player base. Not everyone is going to spend money on the cash shop. Not everyone is going to buy every mount skin. I didn't buy quite a few.
---
At the end of the day that's 5 million a month on average, again, in the middle of the expansion cycle, or a long long time after the last expansion. The game is still successful and still making money. 
---
Trying to claim, as the person I was replying to originally did, that there's less and less revenue is factually false. What you've said doesn't change what I've said at all. 
---
If people want to make shit up, I'm happy to call them on it. 
---
Kinky Daddy\~
---
lol thanks for answering this, i derped and just used lingo
---
it gives you a few fire orchids and you use those and the unbound magic to buy the trinkets/amulet... which are about 125? 100? a pop
---
it is pretty good!
---
Ah right, my tiredness is kicking in.
---
Also random one but wasn't the signet ring that broke illusions in the Jokos instance kind of Lyssa related

I still can't get 90% of this comics
---
For me -&gt; monday/wednesday 3 hours pve raid, thursday 2.5h wvw raiding, tuesday ~1h, sat/sun whatever spare time I have sometimes 1h sometimes 8h's... I have 750g 7 ascended armor sets tons of ascended weapons 1 bifrost 1 lege backpack. So yes it's possible and worth playing. The only real grindy stuff I do is home instance/guildhall nodes, black lion key farm every week. all other gold income is from various things. You can work w/e time you need on your goal (a legendary for instance) and nothing is mandatory.
---
Oh, I thought you meant in game. What is defined as "Meta" in sites like MetaBattle doesn't really matter, MetaBattle doesn't set the meta, it merely tries to keep up with it. Core Guard is strong in soloQ at any level and is widely played in soloQ, far more than FB actually which I'd guess MetaBattle calls a meta build.
---
Core Ranger and War also do not suck. Core fresh air ele can also wreck teams if it's not focused down and is played well. They might not be ideal or meta but you can compete with them without doubt. 
---
I'm playing this game well into my early 40s with lots of other commitments. Highly recommended if you get busy but still want that mmo exprience. The gear grind is barely anything. 
---
For exotic stuff it's cheap. For ascended stuff weps and armour you need to plan ahead especially on type of build and then focus on the associated crafting professions to make em. Ofcourse there are lots of other ways to  get ascended stuff lots of guides  on the internet for that.
---
 The only real grind I've seen is for legendary equipment which gives no stat benefits however over ascended but does have some benefits in terms of slotting runes and sigils. The meta in the game does shift around every 4-6 months ..if you are into the while keeping up with the meta stuff... which may keep you on your toes a bit.
---
This is because its too easy to get dailies done in one pvp game. People are there that don't want to pvp they just want an easy 2g 
---
thank you. 
---
will go for that!
---
Whirling Axe, I love everything about this skill, animation, how it looks like with Astralaria, damage it does and the fact that moving/jumping doesn’t interrupt it.
---
In Caudecus' Manor, there's a painting of Logan Thackeray. People wonder why. Here is an attempt at explaining it.

Thank you, I will try to test on the ghostly tonight

I wish I had time to play 3-6 hours a week. But even if I play less I still have a blast
---
Mesmer clones of Logan
---
Oh shit, I thought you drew char. I like your art style but sometimes it's a real struggle figuring out which character they represent.
---
She is a bit smushed isn’t she? Probably too many boops. He’s wearing one of the human cultural armors I just over elaborated it 
---
Thanks! 
---
The OP didn't ask how the games revenue was he wanted to know if the population was going up or down.
---
Also with mega servers there will always be people around until you can't even fill the first instance of maps.
---
I never understood the hostility at pointing out that the game is pretty clearly past it's prime. I get you've invested time and resources but as an older gamer let me assure you at the end of the day all you'll have to take away is memories and screen shots. It's not a bad thing, nothing lasts forever, but it's something to keep in mind if you find yourself getting too attached. 
---
There is no BEST only BEST AT. (we miss you iamoneandiamlegion aka nemesis)
---
Scythe are skins right now for staves, but not actual weapons yet, classes / elite specializations able to use them are Elementalist, mesmer, Daredevil*, revenant, guardian, Druid*, necromancer  (death shroud summons a scythe to be wielded with Reaper elite specialization), 
---
Anytime, though u may miss out on things to do, runes etc to be able to be gotten fro. Expacs, be sure to only buy from approved merchants.
---
Start on pve first not PvP because you are going to make enemies fast in PvP not knowing your class or objectives 
---
My full Vipers Scourge craps out a 2800 shield every 6(?) seconds, all over the encounter area. It's enough that it'll block that next hit you're gonna take. And on top of that, FUCK my parties conditions. CLEANSED. FUCK that bosses boons, CORRUPTED. 
---
I was real down in the dumps because everyone always shouts about how great Power builds are, and how Necro doesn't bring much to the table, but when adds spawn on boss and I can just Epidemic and make them go away it really feels like I'm helping. 
---
I -love- my Necro, to the point that idk what I want to gear up next because why not just bring the super tanky plagueboi?
---
&gt; So I played GW2 way back when it was first released for about half an hour and didn't like it at all
---
Well, the starter tutorial areas don't really represent much of them game. It's possible that you just didn't get on with whatever you were playing. It's free, and you have an account, so give it a go.
---
&gt;  what classes excel in PvP? 
---
It's largely down to player skill, but mirage (mesmer elite) and soulbeast (ranger elite) are both considered very strong. 
---
&gt;  I used to play hunter classes only and then changed it to healers
---
A ranger (pet class) can spec into druid (healing elite spec), so that might be your thing. 
---
&gt; I know there is no holy trinity
---
There's a soft one. Tanks are still marginal and are much more active in their defence than in WoW, but there has been an increase in support builds since you last played. For open world, it's non-existent but for instanced content the more challenging it becomes, the more the trinity starts to develop. 
---
&gt; Also when should I buy the expansions?
---
They do on sale all the time. You can't access any expansion content without a level 80 character, so it's worth having a crack at it for free and making your mind up. Almost half of the zones are at level 80, so there is a lot of content at cap and new zones are released approximately every three months that require the latest expansion.  
---
It's also worth considering that the core game zones are considered a bit dated at this point by much of the playerbase, and the game has evolved in zone and event design over time. Old zones tend to be huge, have 10-15 "heart quests" and a few scattered events, whereas newer zones tend to be much tighter, only have 3 or 4 hearts and have a series of structured, paced events that tell a story and feel much more focussed. It's not unusual for people to get to earlier zones and think "what the hell am I meant to be doing?", which tails off as you get further into the content. It's a bit hit and miss, but newer zones generally feel less like staring into the void than older ones. 
---
An imperfect comparison would be the Blood Elf and Worgen starter zones in WoW - the Belf zone feels dated because it's older, with more of a focus on grinding quests while you learn your skills, whereas the Worgen one tells a story and moves you across the map with varied content - it's kind of like that. 
---
Because we tried stuffing Asura in our turrets but they ended up making too much noise. So now they are build with robots. 
---
Those cheetahs man, they throw everyone off! 
---
Thank you! 
---
Adding onto this, both Vulkan and DX12 are libraries that do very little work for the programmer. The drivers are minimal and will not feature updates to improve a singular games performance.
---
On top of that, while the API is independent of hardware, Nvidia does have stability issues with DX12 and some features are not fully supported.
---
Both AMD and Nvidia gpus have favored ways of handling things. When calls are made. Memory reservations, and even the order in which data is submitted.
---
"New" lel please this is the oldest known location for idle minions/turret farming.
---
Also these are most likely not bots but just lazy/bored players. Anet gives us the opportunity to do this while watching vids/studying by using auto-cast. As long as you are at your computer it does not break the ToS.

For those saying it has bad impact on economy, please be realistic, doing literaly ANYTHING else in the game is more profitable than idle farming. These people are just happy to get minimum rewards for no effort. I say leave them be.
---
Pokemon did it first.
---
Very well made considering charr and light armor is hard to pull off hats off!
---
Since you mentioned outfits, several armor pieces are also the same on every armor class. Most are from the gem store like the [Foefire armor pieces](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Foefire_Armor_Package), but some are from other sources too, like the [Witch Hat](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Witch%27s_Hat) or the [Fused Gauntlets](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Light_Fused_Gauntlets).
---
If Indiana Jones was a charr this would be your charr mirage!
---
To give some examples: From the gem store, the \[Foefire armor pieces\]([https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Foefire\_Armor\_Package](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Foefire_Armor_Package)), from other sources, the \[Witch Hat\]([https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Witch%27s\_Hat](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Witch%27s_Hat)) or the \[Fused Gauntlets\]([https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Light\_Fused\_Gauntlets](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Light_Fused_Gauntlets)).
---
Idk if im doing this wrong or not but i dont notice a difference in performance at all. Only thing that's different is that the map takes a little longer to load.
---
Does anyone know how to contact Anet with something that doesnt really fall into support? I am working on making a big poster with GW theme to my room, and i would like to write to them regarding the resolution of pictures, or any chances of getting the raw sketches, as im a big fan of those.
---
Ever since LW came out I had issues with arcdps. I’d crash a lot while in game, to the point where I just perma removed it.
---
Highjacking to say - Weaver air autoattack.
---
The spin you do on the 3rd hit is sick.
---
Bogan Dackery original character plz do not steal
---
Jeez, that's a hard question to answer. For some legendaries you can just buy the precursor off the TP; for others you cannot. I can only speak to my experience in the ONE I have crafted.
---
I had decided up front that I was NOT GOING TO DO IT. Too much grinding, way too much repeating of metas, etc. But one day, after doing the Dragon Stand meta, I got curious as to how close was I to any legendary. So I got on gw2efficieny, and realized how close I was to making one! The main grinds for me were crystalline ores and the Gift of Battle, as I had never done WvW before. The ores were indeed a grind, but the gift, well...WvW is SO MUCH FUN, that it seemed like no time at all before I had the gift of battle.
---
Most of the exploration items were actually fun (once you purchase and start a collection, you'll know what I mean about exploration items.)
---
Hope this helps, and good luck to you if you do decide to pursue a leggy,

That's not gold that's copper. 100 copper = 1 silver. 100 silver = 1 gold.
---
Report them
---
Usually yeah but it's been a while since I've done that part of the living story
---
Absolutely!  
---
 The best gear in the game stays the best gear so you won't be behind. Make sure to log in during new living story to unlock it and /gg
---
Mine are permanently parked in wherever the heck they were when I last used them.
---
Honestly my daily to do list has grown long enough by now that I don't log onto alts unless I need to.
---
Shut up and either go play the game or uninstall the game. That spot has been exactly the same for years and has never negatively impacted your life. Move on.
---
You don't need to grind anything to play to endgame, so yes.
---
Even then, you'll do just fine at everything except high-tier fractals and raids with a little perseverance.
---
Gw2 is mainly a pve game and limiting your self to pvp (and wvw) can get boring pretty fast.
---
Scourge necro, firebrand guardian , mirage mesmer are some of the best classes to play in pvp in general and all require pof expansion to play.
---
Scythes are just different skins for staff weapons. There arent scythe weapons, just staves that look like scythes, and some classes like daredevil thieves and revenants can use staves as a melee weapon.
---
There are some core professions that are pretty good and meta as well , guardian being one of them
---
Search for condi reaper benchmark videos and you will find someone who used greiving.  Iirc greiving and vipers were about equal 
---
Just yell out in a city, "any guild recruiting?" and you're bound to get a couple invites. If you're not sure about a certain guild, just remember that you can add up to 5 guilds so look around. 
---
&gt;Like most MMOs there are ebbs and flows. We're in the middle of an expansion cycle and still maintaining that level of player retention. It's higher than you think.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;After an expansion there's more players in every game, but make no mistake. Guild Wars 2 has a high, stable population.
---
You did make some unsubstantiated claims about the population. 
---
Also at this point I'd argue telling people we are in the middle of an expansion cycle suggesting there are upcoming expansions while Mike's statements seem to point towards the opposite is misinformation.
---
I used to think its a big deal but really its not that bad. People are generating artificial mat faucets by spending a bit more on their monthly electricity bill (depending on their local prices or renting contract). 
---
The only thing I'd like to see is remove the 5th version of each utility category and rework them into a new utility skill type. Skills like Rocket Turret, Throw Mine, Elixer B and the Tool Kit. 
---
Rework them into a new utility skill type but keep the effects of the skill. That way the weakest of every current utility group can be put into a new utility group category and they can get buffed with traits and other interactions.
---
There will be a small difference between 6 and 8 as theoretically u can stack as many as there are stat types. Wether 2 more bees is worth your gold, probably not, and those running by won't notice u have 8 instead of 6..
---
&gt;Kormir said something along the lines of "Even Lyssa didn't object leaving Tyria" iirc.
---
Specifically, the line was:
---
**Kormir:** The rest of the Six—[Dwayna](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dwayna), [Grenth](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Grenth), [Melandru](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Melandru), even [Lyssa](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Lyssa)—reached an agreement. Balthazar had to be dealt with.  
---
That doesn't really say much, tbh, since it all just means Lyssa agreed to strip Balthazar of his power. There is another line, in Kormir's Journal, where Kormir writes that Lyssa mocked her for staying so long, which runs counter to the arguments really.
---
I had to look at the painting again to make sure 
---
Actually they "stole" all mobs, when I tried to complete the nearby heart. 
---
However, I complained about it in mapchat an they showed me a way to complete the heart way faster, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
If I recall the old one was return and they replaced it. The new one should show all the minis in a collection  
---
If I manage to shut down the boonspam with a scourge without help just long enough for my mates to kill the mobs, I am sure the average group can find enough boonhate utility to do the same. 
---
I am having a very hard time understanding that sheet you made. Can you jsut give me a summation as to which are the most profitable per tool? You said Bounty is the best by far for sickle. So what is the best for mining and logging?
---
Also they technically always say play for free rather than free to play. Semantics 
---
When I had this problem I had to install visual c++ 2012. Same for my friends with the same problem.
---
Not really. It was a reference to the original methods of learning skills in GW1 during the early betas, that got scrapped well before release. In effect, players had to find [skill gems](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Skill_Gem) (later changed to [skill charms](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Skill_Charm)) and skill rings. Skill gems / charms allowed players to temporarily use a skill for a limited number of uses, while skill rings allowed a player to permanently learn the skill.
---
This isn't the first reference to these: [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Orrian\_History\_Scrolls#Everyday\_Magic\_in\_Orr\_and\_Signets](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Orrian_History_Scrolls#Everyday_Magic_in_Orr_and_Signets)
---
Basically they got added to the lore as "shortly after the Exodus, before ambient magic became high in quantity, people had to use signet rings to use magic. People in places of high magic like Orr didn't (or could lose them sooner)."
---
This is why Braham mentions the ring as being ancient magic and that he thought no one used them anymore.
---
The wardrobe function still isn't upto date and missing skins until they've been unlocked on the account.  
---
Also it's pretty unfair to a player to expect them to see something they like, mesmerize the look, then spend the next 10 minutes trying to go through the wardrobe hoping to see it again. 
---
There's a reason we occasionally get the screen shots with the what skin is this question on this sub.
---
I really don't understand why these haven't been released. New hairstyles is a good thing. 
---
&gt; I also get the feeling they didn't exactly test the fractal in terms of which instabilities would make it horrible to play, e.g.
---
This. Everthing else is somewhat doable but the Endboss with for example Birds is horror. You need to dodge to transfer the steep damage of the birds but there just isn't enough space to dodge because you would roll out of the Shark, into the wind or into one of the other 50 AoEs. The footwork/coordination required for the Endboss is challenging without instabilities but with certain instabilities all I do is cope which leads to no DPS or Support.
---
Wish they would enable it in pve or smt. I would love to see where my tank is on largos so they dont randomly turn around and hit me or get agony on cairn and see where my allies are rather than having to check whether theyre clones...
---
We don't know yet. We just know Anet has stated that it was intentional, and that the gods' story isn't yet over (mind you that could have been in reference to Hall of Chains...).
---
One note: Balthazar likely got Lyssa's Mirror from the various reliquaries in Siren's Landing, as he went there undisguised (people recognized him as Balthazar, not Lazarus), suggesting he went there either before being disguised, or after losing his disguise. Since the purpose of his visit was to ensure no one would learn his disguise, by hiding the final aspect of Lazarus in Abaddon's reliquary, it seems unlikely he'd go there after the events of Episode 5. So before he was disguised - thus before he had the mirror - is far more likely.
---
I'm afraid those are way out of my reach... Hmm but I shall look into it. I was thinking of buying a slot so I can play a new character.
---
Caudecus was always transparently evil but from what I remember from the dungeon and what little personal story I saw he used to be better at hiding it. I guess getting real close to a victory with the White Mantle (plus all that bloodstone he was snarfing) finally allowed him to go full ham
---
Geralt, is that you?
---
So, in other words, you have nothing to complain about and yet here you are. Get over it.
---
Polymock predated pet battles by like four years.
---
you can do it, ANet. bring us polymock 2.0 with miniatures. 
---
Rip grimoire
---
the speed is not influenced tho. the walking speed is the same.  
---
makes sense that you cross overall less horzontal distance when going upwards. but that has nothing to do with running speed.
---
Id just contact support. Worst case, theyll just tell you where to contact anet exactly for that reason. 
---
All this while being able to move
---
Interesting?
---
I like the idea, but it would be extremely low priority for me. I'd rather see some kind of sorting for the minis with different categories to organize them by.
---
What shark?
---
Didn't they used to have server wide bonuses for a long time after launch? Atleast, i remember something along those lines.
---
Water-Attuned Elementalist Shark, Mystery solved.
---
Taking their sweet ass time, it seems. Over a thousand and three hundred years.
---
Tell the commander to mark the tank and/or tanking location
---
Just totally disagree.
---
Don't forget to mention that chrono is a very good pdps class at the moment too, it's not just there for boons.
---
I always use textured brushes myself, gave up on smooth lines a long time ago. For me the best tip is understand your intention with each stroke. Don’t get overly occupied with copying your sketch and instead focus on depicting your idea with lines that mean something. Ahh the philosophy of linework! 
---
So, does this donkey's brain works every 3 minutes and then just shut down?
---
I'd actually love it if the GW1 Primordus is his actual size, and the GW2 version is all the living lava and rock he's gathered and solidified around himself as a shield. The map meta against him could involve breaking it away piece by piece until his actual body is revealed, which we finish off in our personal story.
---
Life........finds a way
---
It's funny that GW2's pugs justify why looking-for-raid difficulty exists in World of Warcraft.
---
Back before I left that game for GW2, I kept joking about how nonsensical that mode was. Sure it's just a pug, but c'mon, don't dumb down everything to the point where you can hit buttons randomly and kill an expansions final boss.
---
Few years later, GW2 adds raiding and I **wish** it had LFR.. :(
---
I want to drink a bobblehead potion just to see what happens.
---
Fruitless I'd guess, since we don't even know what shape he is. Could have fangs like a sabertooth tiger, or tiny rows of them.
---
The players aren't the only one's who can powercreep.
---
I'm sure you're much better than you think!
---
Haha, I'm sure that's not true! :P
---
OMG LOOK HOW MUCH LI I HAVE I WON THE ARGUMENT
---
&gt; Once you get that Legendary great sword, well, that's as good as it gets.
---
Just to add something.
---
Legendaries only have looks, not stats. Statwise, it's the same thing as ascended, which by itself isn't that far from exotic. 
---
Oh I already got over it at the point they showed me that better way to complete the heart. 
---
I didn't mean it as a bad comment, it was a good experience. No bots (at least not all, since a few answered me) and they helped me nicely, even when I was kinda pissed first. 
---
So, in other words, nothing to complain about and yet here I am, telling that it's not only "not bad", but also can be good.
---
Report &amp; play on.
---
&gt;apply "outnumbered" buffs to structures. No loot, no points for flipping towers and keeps while a server has "outnumbered"
---
Basically make it completely pointless to even be in WvW if you are on a superior server then? 
---
&gt;bind "Pips" to things like daily quests. "Kill 250 enemy players", "Flip 20 camps", etc
---
So, people on superior servers will not be able to get any pips then? Since there won't really be many players nor will there be anything to flip.
---
That guy was jealous you could craft legendary set and he still can't with his 1200 LIs (not even a big number btw)
---
i guess i should've said, asura is best for learning JPs if you're not used to giant characters
---
Same. We suck as commanders. 
---
I don't want to make a new thread for it so here it goes:
---
Any chronomancers mains running around in WvW? Talking about small scale roaming, what gear are you using? Is it good in 1vX like my Holosmith?
---
Or do i straight up learn mirage?
---
I think prefer chrono because i really like that time warp thingy and the shield block. 
---
Asking this question before i use my small amount of gold and time to gear one up.
---
&gt;I could play it with my friends
---
wat??? And now you can't because of...? It's a MMO, on PC, made to play with friends and strangers alike. There is nothing that stops you except yourself.
---
As someone who hasn't really kept up with PvE meta can I just ask, is power warrior meta now in fractals \raids? I have a Warrior and been looking for another class to play fractals with other than just my guard, but I haven't thought about War since I remembered people were only playing condi Berserker and I don't have condi gear but I do have my Guards full zerk set.
---
Is it worth getting invested in power war for PvE? 
---
This why I don’t raid at all. 
---
Pugs are full of literal mouth breathers, nothing new. 
---
Oh, so he's jelly of Rytlock's friendship with Logan.
---
You were actually lucky getting kicked. You wouldn't want to be in a group led by a person like that in the first place.
---
I have heaps of fun raiding with guildies but I wouldn't want to try it with pugs after seeing this kind of stuff. I'm sure plenty of people are great to raid with but it is definitely discouraging.
---
You keep them in incomplete stacks so you can send the messages quickly by ctrl+clicking on each, that shows you actually have multiple stacks and are not pinging the same one 
---
It's a standard of pinging for above 250 LI
---

im glad i stopped raiding in this dead game, pugs are retarded
---
Couldn't you just link the same full stack 5 times and it would look exactly the same as if you actually linked 5 seperate stacks?
---
He knows what he's doing; he's an asshole.
---
Yes, yes they do.  I'm a beta player and this game is my main squeeze but I mostly play WvW.  I was interested in doing Raids with my guild when they came out but the guy they put in charge to run the show was one of these assholes.  I lost interest immediately, and have never stepped foot in a raid since because things I hear don't encourage me enough to want to try, and I've still managed to scrape together around a dozen legendary weapons and close to finishing my legendary light set.  The Completionist in me aside, I guess I'll make do without them.
---
If only she had eaten someone who excels at self-resurrection...
---
Reading comments, this reddit is no different from the official forum, except for seeing 'shithead' more often. 
---
Seeing the post itself shows something else, namely you think your butthurt is something new and fresh. This reddit spends roughly as much time on crying how bad and elitist are players who actually amounted to something in this game as they do jacking off to 'omg, my GF painted my chrono, uwuwuwu'  
---
So don't feel special, this happens to many people because many people are retarded. Just buy yourself a commander tag, tag up and ask for whatever you wish people to bring, or whatever casuals of this reddit tell others to do.
---
Greatsword / scepter+focus.
---
It's a power dps build. 
---
[enjoy.](http://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Guardian_-_Power_DPS)
---
Its sadly a bit too unknown and yet another site where you have to punch in your api key but I found this is fairly easy on both sides of the raider and the commander
---
https://killproof.me/proof/2Xqv My account for example
---
Because screw pinging
---
Then we had different experiences, im pretty sure you had AFKs and trolls in most of them, im sure of it
---
The moment he said leggy does not count as li I lost hope for him. I just blocked him after the last message :)
---
You say that, but then there sure are a lot of people like that in the raiding community.
---
&gt; players who actually amounted to something in this game as they do jacking off to 'omg, my GF painted my chrono, uwuwuwu'
---
I'm just gonna double-check his statement here too. 
---
Art is *way* more difficult than watching a raid video and timing a Snowcrows preset rotation. :P  
---
And applying that to "amounting to something" is guffaw-worthy. 
---
New player here, almost none of these acronyms make any sense to me, and i dont know where to start to get into raiding in GW2... Is there like a page or wiki i can read to understand how this works?
---
This is my take whenever I see anyone put inane requirements on an inappropriate raid.  
---
Ex. if you need 250LI people to beat Vale Guardian, I probably have better things to do with my time than carry your ass.
---
The simplified rotation is way better on Holo, but that's kinda a VG only thing. If you want to play it correctly, both base Engineer and Holosmith have a complex rotation.
---
&gt; in most of them
---
Do I really have to repeat myself a third time?
---
Pvp is another story, but for pve I always love a classic banner Tactics warrior.  Plenty of unique damage buffs and good cc.  If you want to go off-meta for a more "all inclusive" playstyle, you can go forceful greatsword + phalanx strength to add high aoe might generation for everyone around you.
---
It's a classic build with lots of role compression, but it lost favor for other might generation builds like druid when group content expanded to 10 people.
---
I'd say it's a big number considering it's 1% of gw2efficiency.
---
Raid elitists appear to be GW2's special snowflakes.
---
I wouldn’t want to be in that group with a leader that dumb...
---
At some point LFG raiders need to admit they need to tone down on the stringent rules and gatekeeping.
---
Works wonderfully in FFXIV. A lot of people raid because of it, they may not do Savage Mode raids but at least they get played often.
---
Frankly that's a shame, it's a lot of fun. But I can understand not wanting to reiterate that kind of experience.
---
Yes. 
---
thus proving that raids are accessible even for the most mentally challenged 
---
Rubik hasn't been in MnF for several months now (Oct or so). Unless this was from long ago.
---
&gt; Honestly I'm not entirely comfortable with this strip cause I feel like the punchline might come across as "Lol he gay"
---
Honestly, and I say this as a gay guy, I did get a bit miffed for a split second... But then I remembered that someone having a disturbed sexual obsession for another person is creepy as fuck regardless of gender and orientation. You're good.
---
It seems more and more likely as we're moving away from the gods story again that it was just a loose story thread they left in intentionally in case they wanted to go further down that road. They may come back to it later I guess.
---
&gt; Unfortunately a lot of T4 pugs these days play with the mentality of just facetanking things and letting the druid take care of it
---
yea that's what you tend to get when you keep adding aoe spam, condi spam and nerf the mob damage super hard
---
it's choosing the path of least resistance 
---
before blaming people for taking the easy way we should look at bad design choices
---
TL;DR
---
LI are Legendary Insights, you earn one each time you kill a boss per week (for the first four wings). Legendary armor costs a certain amount of LI per piece of armor. So if you are asked to show you have XXX LI, you can either ping them, or ping the equivalent in legendary pieces. This commander has refused the armor ping, and thus, is dumber than a brick.
---
Oasis got toned down and tweaked a ton, so that's not a good example of how people just gotta get used to things.
---
Same I never went to raids either, I can't deal with people screaming because of doing less than 1 damage(you get the point) than meta builds are supposed to do. I want to play to have fun not to have this hardcore idiots that think they know better.
---
&gt;screenshots must be taken in game, no camera shots.
---
YES! Thank you!
---
I'd rather have a story mode for raids, where you can experience the raid solo or up to 5 players, with simpler mechanics, letting you see the story unfold, and obviously lessened rewards. One thing I hated about the first 3 wings was that they bridged the story from HoT to S3E1, but if you didn't do the raid, then you never got to know what is going on. 
---
It's quite interesting, but probably never going to be brought up again, kind of like the Wizard's Tower. Maybe in GW3 lel.
---
I've tested **Herald** on the pvp area and it felt energy starved, and I didn't test **Renegade** but I did read it's good. When you mean healing, you mean the centaur legend?
---
Fact is that a lot of players want to complete everything with minimal effort without wipes or slowdowns so, asking for high numbers and a crapton of LI is what they seek for because IN THEORY it minimizes the chance to encounter "bad" players.
---
In reality most of them are just lazy and want to be carried. 
---
You just answered yourself, you wouldn't that's why every commander assumes worst case scenario
---
Join a training guild or community: https://snowcrows.com/raids/training/
---
Also this website has guides on build and and bosses. most of the information you need is there.  
---
No! Stop making me feel feelings! :'(
---
If you're landing naturally, and dont have any other movement enhancing options at your disposal, yes in any case.
---
But if you end your glide by shutting your glider and falling to the ground, that needs testing - if you are losing horizontal movement speed during freefall, it could very well be the other way around.
---
The true answer is prone to so many different factors.
---
Legendary Insight.
---
He's just curious what the ruckus is all about and decided to hover above the water for a closer look. 
---
Exactly
---
I loved raiding in FF14...I just couldn't justify the subscription fee any longer when I was busy with school/work, and just haven't been able to return yet.
---
Was hoping to get into raiding in GW2 but that isn't working out well at all (sticks in the mud about only running SnowCrows builds exactly as written and all that). I suck with Axe on Soulbeast, sorry. Is running Dagger off-hand instead *really* a deal-breaker? Yes? Then count me out lol
---
There arnt really any other ways to go about it if a group require more than 250 of x.
---
I get they want quick runs but that in itself is just lazy as fuck. 
---
I see youtubers and personalities ask “why do you not want to get into raids let me know”, and the reality is it’s because the vast majority of the raid community don’t want to budge on the entry requirements. And then you get situations like the OP. 
---
I need it
---
Also what headpiece is that? Gem store headpiece?
---
Nah, more like 200 years, or whenever they decided that Tyria is screwed because of the dragons.
---
I am sorry, as a avid raider I think that the title you used for the post is completely misleading. This is one example... There are really good people in the raiding community and things like this just scare new players to try raiding... I am not saying that you should not share situations like this but putting such a impactful title is just silly....
---
If you spam 1 stack of 250 then a stack of 249 very fast we assume it is real. If you spam 1 stack of 250 then split it to then spam the 249 stack its going to be a delay. If you notice the delay you assume its fake
---
Yeah I used to raid a lot back during release (150+ LI, did w1-4 except Xera and Deimos, which I've gotten since my return). Nowadays I just go if someone in the guild or a friend wants me to join a raid, or for my weekly training raid static -- which is very welcoming and has none of that tryhard bullshit. 
---
Pugs and elitism have gotten significantly worse since my hiatus and are even seeping into fractals. I got kicked from a pug run once that LFGed 'T4 DPS' because apparently my DPS sucks and they were doing Nightmare CM and 'couldn't carry me'... although I've done Nightmare, multiple times before, and although the LFG never said they were going to do Nightmare CM.
---
Like, I'm all up for optimizing DPS and making sure everything goes as smoothly as possible, and they are perfectly justified to kick me for whatever reason they deem worthy, even if it's ridiculous... but it does feel like in general, the PUG for endgame instanced content has its head up its ass? 
---
Anyway, my advice for anyone starting out in raids (and even T4 fractals) is to get a group of friends who are willing to do it with you. PUGs are rarely worth the time nowadays, unless you really have no one else to do it with.
---
I have almost finished my 3rd set and I have used most of my LIs in crafting. I never bother relogging to show my armor sets, I just link my KPs from the bank which are never going to be used as decorations like they were intended to be.
---
It could be an allied only option.
---
They won't, and they'll cry that they can't assemble groups. "Dirty casuals are ruining this game!!1!" and all that. Newsflash to those gatekeepers, you need casuals to learn the ropes if you want more players in the mode 😉
---
Extreme snob-ism, not even once. 
---
These people exist in fractals too, by the way. They think that they can skip mechanics in T3 and in fact end up causing a party wipe and leaving shortly afterwards by throwing a fit. Especially when there are also disgusting combinations of instabilities.
---
I mean, can there be at least one 20k+ guy that is not a manchild, who gets an elitistic disorder when playing with pugs?
---

I've browsed this subreddit for years. YEARS. And finally, I have found you. You're the number 1. You're the man the writings told me about. I've witnessed the average IQ of the sub drop lower and lower every day, with seemingly no way to stop it. Until now. You, you will save us. Your skilled, trained, unique brain will bring the average IQ back to where it belongs, right above any other subreddit. Thank you, million IQ man. My search ends here, but your efforts have only begun. May your enlightened intelligence teach those raiding bastards and crooked anet who the game was made for. Thank you, million IQ man. Thank you.

Legendary Divinations (sometimes mentioned as LD) from PoF raids are acquired the same way (but have almost no use right now) and are generally counted as LI as well.

https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ancient_Shark_Pistrix
---
In the old days you could see a note about Pistrix nearly every patch until they gave up with him, fun times :&gt;
---
And this is why I will never raid and why the majority of casual players wont either. Sad truth
---
This has more to do with not thinking for more that 1 second than gatekeeping or having "strict" rules. Any normal person would have made a quick count and realized this was more than enough. Hell it's even easier to check for the leg armor if the player is actually wearing it with the initial skin that it is to check if the LIs are real.
---
I've done world exploration a fair amount of times and for the most part they all play out the same. 
---
I do like some of the unique ones, I remember one in Bloodtide Coast which has you mixing together potions and testing them on animals, I like that one quite a lot.
---
I heavily dislike the ones which take too long and have you waiting forever. A heart in Queensdale where you kill those shadow portals in the swamp is terrible, especially if someone arrived before you and you'll just have to wait to get any progress done on it
---
Yep, I can hop on at any ungodly hour and que up for a normal raid and get in pretty fast, in GW2 though outside of peak hours its just wasting your time trying to raid

I rather take noobs and explain the fractal than try to rush anything and everything.

Sometimes when I pug, I say I have envoy title, and 1/5 times the commander acts like a moron, he either does not know what envoy is or say something stupid like " I don't care about ur title spam li ". I  leave these squads as fast as I can.

Quick maffs

Almost all of the post-core Tyria Hearts have felt painfully over tuned. It's nice that they're there, but I wish they didn't feel like enormous, repetitive speed bumps.
---
This person not thinking is a symptom of a culture in raid communities imo. Better to stick to the script than think for yourself.
---
I think the island should be bigger, and with more dinosaurs.
---
But hey, that's just me :I.

Imagine taking gw2 raising seriously

 it's possible, I'll have to look into it more later and see, but thanks!

The bosses are pretty much glorified pinatas too, with barely no interesting mechanics to make the fights be actually fun.
---
The three fractals we got during HoT's life cycle were great (and two had hard modes), but the three of PoF so far are pretty lackluster, gameplay-wise.
---
I'm embarrassed people like that even exist.
---
I agree. Those plying bastards.
---
Do daily fractals for a chance at a chest
---
I think they are afraid to tell him polymock is cancelled, because by now he must have One Punch Man levels of arm strength after all this hammering. 
---
So they let him keep working on fixing a gate that won't work because its sister gate has been disabled.
---
Go up you legend
---
It's embarrassing people like that even exist.
---
It wouldn't have any benefit for you as (I assume) your system isn't compatible with DX12
---
As long as we have flairs so everyone can filter out the trash, who cares? If you want to look for upvote/downvote problems, address the elephant in the room, which is the constant downvoting of interesting threads.
---
I don't like "lazy screenshots", but I don't care about the quality of the screenshots themselves.
---
Design, or do you make them? Out of curiosity.
---
I genuinely believe it's not that fast. It's easy to just make something in 3D program, but mechanics need to be implemented, there is a second map for pathfinding of NPC's (like all the summons). I neither see it possible to be done solo, nor done in this "3 months" deadline. 
---
Skin is Winged Headset. Yeah its was gemstore item, its been off the store for a bit. Hopefully comes back soon.
---
This. Usually, this kind of "LI obsessed" guys are just assholes with no LIs of their own, who want to get carried.
---
You will learn this lesson either the hard or the easy way.
---
&gt; Interesting?
---
You absolutely are.
---
I agree. I think if they halved the progression needed for those hearts, they would be much more tolerable. I mean do I really need to bring 20 refugees a medicine (press F, run, press F)? Wouldn't 10 times be sufficient?
---
They still come back to your character, but they no longer roam around while idle.
---
And the leash is so large that they take ages to 'wake up' and follow. I wish they followed more like how pets and minions follow.
---
But I need to have that character in order to start the collection? Chrono and mirage both are useless to me because I use GS and swords.
---
I recommend this guide: https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guide:How_to_Gear_a_Character
---
But very shortly: Bitterfrost frontier + Sirens Landing for trinkets (easy farmable maps)
---
Elite spec collections for weapons
---
And fractals for armor/weapons, core Tyria stats for drops, all stats if you buy the Cobald(?) Armor/weapons on the vendor
---
Could start getting into raiding as certain bosses drop some weapons and grab armor from currency (time will be your main hindrance)
---
This is what I meant when I said raids are not accessible: We have created an incredibly tight community in which you either have the time to find someone to train you and even use third party software to do so, or... well, this usually happens. 
---
This is a problem because other MMOs give the player the tools to learn raiding on the spot, without needing training guilds or KPs or whatever (FFXIV, ESO, WoW), but we, as the most casual MMO in the market, doesn't even bring that to the table.
---
That always happens after a major patch. I always remove arc when new content hits and wait for delta to release a patch.
---
Ohh right, wasn’t sure lol
---
EU or NA? I play NA and it's 2/3 of the time the commander acts like a dork over minutiae...
---
Anything with snail progress is not fun, especially if there isn't a lot to do. There's one in Ascalon region where you have to do something with Devourer eggs. That one takes longer than necessary imo.
---
There are some things you can do to trivialise the fight though, as long as you have a few people who know what to do. That's what I love about raids, it's so nice to pick a "difficult" role and let others figure stuff out. After a while you get to give them more responsibilities andf really find themselves getting into raids as well.
---
Then what does? If nothing means anything then why not take anyone?
---
It's for sure more reliable than LI/LD... 
---
ho hum
---
what, guildies didn't slap you on your back and *hip hip hooray* enough over your '6 bees'?
---
you know you already know the answer to your question, but I want to take time to press "LIKE" on your vaunted accomplishment.
---
Deepstone is too long. The final fight should have happened in the maze section, once cleared. No elevator and no extra room for the final boss. 
---
Or, you know, make it a bit longer, with less linearity, and call it a dungeon instead. I don't think the story part is inherently bad, the faults lie within the gameplay design decisions.
---
It's a pity the Chaos fractal didn't get a hard mode some day. I would kill for merge+remake of Molten and Aetherblade fractals as well, if only to make them more similar to Nightmare.
---
Let them enjoy their bubble :)
---
Cm fractals are more demanding than raids tbh
---
Some people like me have usually two problems:
---
\-We write better english than what we can speak/understand
---
\-We have a very tight schedule that lets us play just one or two hours a day and usually we can't play with the people on the Discord servers.
---
I admire those who want to make raiding more accessible and it's thanks to some training run pugs that I could finally raid, but as I said before, most other MMOs let you pug raids without needing voice chat or other third party software because you learn by simply playing, be it story encounters or just the community having another mentality altogether.

---
We shouldn't be subjected to the narrator's pace, that's a big problem, not just with fractals, but story missions too.
---
Also, doesn't help that they talk way too much.
---
I actually really enjoy that stealth one! XD It counts as one of the more unique ones, to me.
---
The one that pops to mind as my least favorite in core tyria is in snowden hills, top left corner? You have to fight centaurs and svanir and destroy flags, or something, and I can never find enough of those enemi.s in the area. Or maybe I can't find the right area to progress the heart?? It's always a miserable slog... like the newer lw and pof hearts &gt;_&gt;;; 
---
..or the heart in claypool. 
---
But to be real for a moment, a large dog with a boar head would be terrifying. Boar are scary enough as it is and willing to ruin your day in an instant - putting that on the strong, fast body of a predator? Gods spare us.
---
We don't even know what his story is supposed to be about. He's literally a ghost we meet at a jumping puzzle, we know nothing about him.
---
Oh, his story was a lie? I didn't know his story in the first place, how am I supposed to care about these "new revelations"?
---
i got my leg armor(almost 2 sets) and got the f out of raids. if i want elitism and toxicity i listen to system of a down and pvp
---
But entering raids is so easy like there are dozen if ways. 
---
Except that's not really the issue here, OP had earned the 250 LIs they were simply not stored as raw LIs.
---
I usually do just take anyone when we LFG and just determine how they do on the bosses themselves. If you're creating a full pug group, I usually just ask them to ping their weapon and their chest armor. I just check to see if that stuff looks normal.

There were a series of hairstyles that were inadvertently released about 2-3 years ago. They were patched out, but people who chose them could still display them.

My suggestion is to go for full exotic lvl 80 berserker gear first on every new char you want to play. Why? Its easy to get, and it's best for open world pve. It will help you to get the job done (pve, story, fractals, farming) as you move to your next step, ascended armor.
---
All berserker armor and weapons  can be bought from TP for relatively small amount of gold. I say relative, bacause I don't know what is your budget and ability's to farm gold. 
---
Other option is to get that gear for dungeon tokens from dungeons like CoF. That is is basically free, you just need do farm that dungeon for couple of days. 
---
Another thing you can use to buy exotic gear is karma. It's not the cheapest option, but if you have excess of karma why not.
---
In the meantime you can get couple of ascended trinkets (rings, amulet, accessories) for laurels if you have any, and fill the rest with some exotic or even rare ones. 
---
When you are equiped like this start doing  daily T1 fractals. You have a chance to get chest with ascended gear and you can use relics to buy the rest of your ascended trinkets.
---
You want to do fractals daily and you want to start crafting. 
---
Your first ascended set is probably going to be from crafting, unless you want to play alot of pvp, wvw or just tons of fractals in hope you get all you need.
---
Nonetheless this will be time consuming. It's gonna last at Least 36 days. 
---
Of course there is always swipe you credit card option, get gems into gold, buy everything off TP, lvl craft in couple of hours and craft ascended gear.
---
This is why I'm hesitant to even start raiding or fractals. I'm much more of a casual player anymore because I don't have the time to dedicate. But I have played for a long time and would love to try and start making legendary items and such. But I feel so intimidated when I look at it. I feel like I'm almost not allowed to join in because I'm not as heavy as a player. 
---
I'm thinking you probably got your exotic gear like I did - which was at a temple of Orr (if it's Aurora, Renegade or Armageddon, then yes).
---
There are some ascended weapons and back-pieces you can get from collections, that don't cost too much in terms of gold,but rather in time. One weapon source is the [Knight of the Thorn](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Knight_of_the_Thorn) side quest, which can be accessed following the end of HoT and results in one ascended weapon that can take one of five forms. There is [Mawdrey](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mawdrey), an ascended backpiece that is obtained via a scavenger hunt that covers Dry Top, jumping puzzles, Mini-dungeons, and Fractals of the Mists, and [The Wayfarer's Henge](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Wayfarer%27s_Henge), another ascended backpiece that is obtained through a series of hidden achievements that are subsequently unlocked, all starting with [The Druid Stone](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Druid_Stone), located in Draconis Mons.
---
These are but a few sources of ascended items that you can obtain without having to max out any crafting disciplines. (Mawdrey does require bloodstone bricks, and you can /wiki the crafting requirements for those.) 
---
I like the Beetle race in snowden drifts
---
You can link without hitting enter, split, enter, relink, can’t you? 
---
tx god i do not like legendary armor skin (change stat is pointless .i do not do that so frequently to justify legendary armor cost) so i can skip it as a whole
---
[There is an option in the settings.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Options#Streaming)
---
GW1 minis showed exclusivity, something which does not exist in GW2, due to how they keep spamming skins nonstop (and the prettiest ones are always in the gem store).
---
Polymock was kinda bland. They have an opportunity to make another minigame, in the same style. You could even go for a TCG using minis instead of cards.
---
Yep, centaur legend + salvation traits offers you a realy strong heals and support skills. Kalla provides strong heals for you and the group, with his ulti and heal skill.
---
Keep in mind that kalla's ulti provides heal + a buff of dmg for 5 players. 
---
Personally is my favourite class in the game, is amazing as supp/healer and as condi dps too (renegade)
---
That's great to hear, but make sure you are always self-aware and don't become one of those people that starts to think they are "exp" just because they managed to get kills weekly.
---
A person can get carried weekly and fool themselves into thinking they are "exp" because they got the kills - this is more common than you would think. These same people also turn out to be the most toxic. They can't handle any form of criticism and any criticism from an outgroup member is always met with hostility - this is normal as people tend to exercise ingroup bias on a daily basis.
---
The real exp players will criticize you not for your clears, but your actual gameplay. Always take these criticism with a grain of salt (as with all criticism), unless they are being extremely abusive in their language (such as calling you names).
---
Why did I say all that? Because Xera is actually a pretty easy boss; as long as 3 people in the group do their work properly, the rest of the people can get carried without realizing it.
---
I made the group. Required 50 ess, not 100, not 150. Made the LFG description without even specifying druid or chrono, just any support comp to cover boons.
---
The group comp had a non-traditional comp to begin with. Zero weavers, required just any healer not only a druid.
---
And the garden variety douchebags still joing a low req group and bitch about a run with no wipes and done in less than 45 minutes.
---
I didn't say 10k DPS, I said "OVER". Extremely low still involves phasing Skorvald and Artsariv in time.
---
People this lazy/stupid/stubborn are used to being carried and don’t actually know mechanics anyways. 
---
Wouldn't bother wasting mats on weapons, do the specialization collections for each class and you'll have most of the weapons that you can stat swap to whatever you like.  The collections for the PoF weapons are fairly easy to do.
---
Keep Stength Runes on the Devona set in for now while you get a better feeling of the class. As a cheap alternative Flame Legion Runes are also pretty good (enemy will always have burning on them as you are a Guard).
---
These garden variety assholes are hard to tell from each other, so I wouldn't know.
---
I can imagine how frustrating that must be. I think players like you described are difficult to explain that to are probably just generally inexperienced, and clearly don't even really understand their role in WvW properly if they equate their surviving to DPS.  In other words that's not a gamemode problem, that's a player experience problem.
---
The difference is that normal mode raids are very accessible in WoW, so all LFR does is let people take a look at the bosses with very little social interaction. GW2 would definitely benefit from some sort of story mode for raids. 
---
I am rich, you know...
---
ideally they want to avoid someone not carrying their weight in the first place.  
---
also, at least in w1 its virtually impossible for 1 person to screw up a run, you would need several people sandbagging to actually fail.
---
I barely ever raid (beat Spirit Vale, Stronghold, and Bastion in some fashion; haven't played through the rest), and a lot of it has to do with the absurdity of LFG. Raiding in GW2 is piss easy compared to other MMOs from my limited experience, but people are ridiculously wound up over it and treat it like hardcore Serious Business for Professionals Only. IMO it's at least a part of why Raid player counts always report as being very low in this game.
---
I just stick to Fractals because of that. While Ess gating is also prevalent, it's less frequent and less extreme of an issue.
---
Worst: any heart that takes longer than 2.5 min to complete.
---
Best: any heart that can be completed in and under 2.5 min.
---
*Internal screaming*
---
At least he doesn't rotate using the keyboard.
---
Raids really don’t require any third party shit at all. 
---
I’m sure they help, but I’ve had no issues doing raids without them, it just means you have to think, look at the map, look at timers, and pay attention to the boss. 
---
It’s a learning process. Watch a video or two on the boss, get some training runs in just trying to stay alive, not DPS, then worry about trying to put it all together. 
---
Then, once you have basics down learn the unique mechanics like orb pushing or cannons or etc so you can do those too. 
---
Whats to stop these LI guys from just linking \[&amp;Avr2LQEA\] (250) type chat codes from - [http://jsfiddle.net/bpyxmbax/](http://jsfiddle.net/bpyxmbax/)
---
Or another type of application/spreadsheet?
---
This is why I seriously hate raiding in this game. It's also why I completely walked away from the game (Short of the LS releases) as well. Anet needs to figure out a better solution then this LI nonsense. I am not a huge fan of the Gearscore that WoW has but its FAR FAR better then some linked gear/trash check in this game. And the same shit affects other grouped areas of the game too like Dungeons (if anyone still runs them LOL) and Fractals (IMHO AR check should be enough). 
---
I got people throwing a shitty fit in T1 fractal. T fucking 1. 
---
You just can't win against these people 
---
&gt; Actually female
---
I'm going to need proof of this.
---
I'm downloading from sratch though, it has around 20 gb left, and my conection is flimsy unless I am in-game, IDK why :B
---
You are my saviour, Thank you!
---
Sounds unbelievable. High li groups will almost never accept 23 LI. Maybe 100 LIl groups will but a 500 one certainly wont
---
pretty sure you can use mounts while carrying those to the npc
---
So actual question, I want to use all my raid boss kill pieces for my guild hall’s decorations! :D Only issue is, people ask for raiders to link their kill pieces to prove they know the fight. Is there a diff way to link them or a diff way to prove worthiness? Lol. Ty for the feedback on this.
---
I came to post this! Absolutely 100% worth looking at. 
---
This is why people don't get into raiding.
---
there a link to a main discord server for GW2?  mainly to ask questions a get quicker responses as a new player?
---
Was hoping for some spicy post, but in the end it's just somebody who didn't have a group that could adapt to the Fractal.
---
&gt; However, unlike those fractal trash mobs, saurians are arguably one of the most irritating species to fight; 
---
Even in T4s, the first pack and mini-boss die quickly. Understandably 95% who have played HoT still don't know how to counter smogscales...
---
&gt; Then you move onto fighting pirates as some pre-boss fight. These would be ok if they didn't crap out boons like they've just eaten at a taco bell. Stability, might, fury, quickness, protection? They've got it all. Let's not forget the conditions they put onto us: chill, vulnerability, weakness, blind, and some various damage-over-time condis like bleeding. 
---
All I see are "boon strip" and "condition cleanse." The game isn't that challenging when you realize that you can swap Utility skills and/or traits to match the encounter.
---
&gt; You finally get into the boss fight in the middle of the fractal, a skeleton that spams instant-down/kill mines. You try to CC him but then realize he doesn't even get stunned, only vulnerable likely because one of the constantly spawning pirates put stability on him. You can't pull any of these spawning pirates in to cleave them because they all have stability. The boss itself pulses its own boons. You can't move because you're absolutely surrounded by mines. 
---
Another demonstration of you not learning the Fractal. Players are shown how cannons can clear mines just prior to entering this encounter, and--lo and behold!--there is a cannon right above the boss arena. Set your lowest DPS derp on it, and have them shoot at mines. Birds may complicate matters, but that's about it.
---
&gt; After you finally kill the boss, you move onto the "hot potato" maze. 
---
Groups with bad coordination can just bum rush each coin sack. Pass the sack to each member, then stack and wipe out the pirates. The ghosts in this maze are extra squishy and die quickly.
---
&gt; 3 LI unused
---
Man, you suck at raiding!
---
Can someone explain what all of these terms mean to a newbie? I don't understand this post lol 
---
I had a nice 1v1 with my WvW heal scrapper a while ago against a Weaver. After a while we both stopped attacking since we could not down each other - I was outhealing his DPS and my DPS was pathetic anyway... :) so I managed to take that monument, since he left first
---
Why not though, raids are fun and decent money
---
In addition to the build /u/mossyandgreen linked [this one](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Guardian_-_Radiant_Greatsword) is very similar but helps with your survival when playing solo in open world. Sword gives you another blind in addition to your greatsword. Using your blinds and your skills that give aegis smartly (i.e. not spamming them all at once), you can negate a ton of damage. Definitely use scepter over sword in fractals, though, and the one trait that's different between the builds is important. Permeating wrath is a DPS increase when in groups so it's good for fractals, but Indomitable courage gives you a stun break which is very useful solo. They use identical gear so switching between those two builds is literally just swapping one weapon and one trait.
---
Well then it's time that you hear bad things. The EU discord is an utter joke. One run per week for new players, 16 free spots.
---
250 kills isn't at all impossible in wvw if you don't dodge fighting. And yes, this was an example like we have at the moment with "Keep capturer". 
---
WvW isn't a gamemode where you get your participation on 6 and afk until it drops to leech your pips - or shouldn't be. You should either bother to participate or don't play it.
---
As stated before. Do you really think all people leave EBG because they want to keep their structures? They still lose them, the attacker just gets no rewards for it. So you choose to fight that attacker and you both have a greater chance to get points. If it's your "idea" of gameplay in a world vs world mode to avoid fights, you may go EOTM
---
The changes are meant to stop people from stacking servers. Making it unattractive to afk at spawn, filling a timezone with all the people you can find to pvdoor.
---
None of the points above are "impossible". There are always camps to flip, just organise a group. This isn't a singleplayer afk mode.
---
That's a paddlin.
---
Preferred:
---
* Mesmer: Chrono gives Quickness + Alacrity, excellent CC, unique utilities via skips, teleports, etc., and can tank. Hard to learn, harder to master, but even after repeated severe nerfs it's one of the best supports in the game for party play.
---
* Ranger: Healer Druid is a powerful healer for teams take take low damage due to Spotter, Spirits, and the ability to hold 25 Might and Fury permanently. Alternatively, Soulbeast DPS (Power or Condi) can be used if someone is already healing, bringing the same spirit boosts as well as sharing Stance skills for more utility. Both are easy to play and strong in open world events.
---
* Warrior has Bannerslave builds, which bring Empower Allies and Banner buffs on a DPS build. Works both for Power and Condi and deals a hefty amount of damage. An outdated other option is Phalanx Strength + Banners with Diviner gear, which outputs solid Might, good damage, and banners, but consider this a more casual/fun build. Both are somewhat easy to play, but less than Ranger.
---
Possibilities:
---
* Elementalist: Auramancer Tempest is the pinnacle of healing output in Guild Wars 2, but has very little else going for it. Can be augmented for a small amount of boons, and Magnetic Aura is a neat trick for some mechanics, but that's about it. On the plus side, it's probably the easiest build in the game to use.
---
* Guardian: A premier Fractal support class, Firebrand can run Quickbrand for DPS, either Power or Condi, while upkeeping 100% Quickness, about 15-20 Might, optional Fury, Bane Signet sharing, and moderate Aegis, Stability, and Protection. Alternatively, it can share the above minus Bane Signet for considerable healing and higher defensive boon uptime. CC and condition cleanse can feel lacking without sacrificing boons or healing, but otherwise a powerful support option. If not in a party, this spec drops off on support power considerably IMO.
---
* Necro: Barrier Scourge grants Might, dumps big barriers on people, offers lifesteal to allies, cleanses tons of conditions and has the strongest wipe recovery in the game thanks to Garish Pillar and Well of Blood. Barriers are great spike damage protection as well, and barriers have the benefit of being unaffected by Agony in Fractals (I think? Used to be affected and I think it was removed). Exceptional in open world events if a lot of players are getting downed.
---
The problem with these were that they had almost no influence. Every server in the matchup got those after 2 days in the matchup and they were "pve only".
---
Came across this message right now. Wonderful thought police you got there A-Net.
---
But on this note my highest respect to all A-Net Staff, who aren't scared and come to reddit (the unsafe place /s).
---
How???
---
3 dps, banner, and healer is the norm. Some teams can mix in renegade/FB, but one of those has to heal. You go in with 5 dps like you used to and 100 doesnt work out. 
---
Im sure some snow crow group can do all the bosses in 10 seconds, making healer useless, but if that is where you point to when saying you dont need a healer, its kind of a poor example. A person can just go on LFG and see what the groups are looking for, healer is up there 100% of the time.
---
Best: Anything that I can go on a murder spree and complete in a few minutes.  Bonus points for special weapons that progress the heart when they hit.
---
Hated: Pretty much all of the lake doric ones.  That matchmaker one in Vabbi.  Ones that involve bundle items that need to be run back to one central collector zzzzzzzz.
---
I mean, someone was linking 255 of the golden pig trinkets using codes off the wiki like you can do with waypoints so there is a way. lol
---
When is the Lunar Festival ending? Has there been any official statement?
---
There are [several builds](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Ranger) you could go for as a ranger. Check open world or fractal builds and try them out in the pvp lobby (heart of the mists) or in Lion's Arch Aerodrome's special forces training area. Once you decide on which one you enjoy the most you can start regearing. If it's exotics it won't be too much of a gold investment, and if it's ascended you can always [stat swap](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stat_changing) it and farm trinkets in LS3 maps.
---
Let's not project onto other people now. 
---
Ah, moderator forum, a lot of people hates them. I only answer to their messages with 😂 emoji. 
---
The shield isn't much, but every bit helps. It's the condi cleansing chill into alacrity that really tickles me right, and scepter 3 CHOMP to say goodbye to NPNG. Also all the mobs basically keeping your life force full at all times.
---
The whole fight feels like it was made for scourge. :D
---
gw2 is not about grinding. it's just that, to so many players, that's the only way they know to play. gw2 is VERY casual-friendly
---
If you want to continue enjoying raids I would avoid any pug group requiring KP or LI. 
---
That’s not a reason though, there’s hundreds of training guilds
---
Not gonna lie, I've been going scepter/dagger to be peak condi spam. Boons? condi. My condi? Your condi. Epidemic: your condi = everyone's condi.
---
I'm playing a Rev for the first time and trying to unlock Herald. I feel weak with the base spec, it sucks. Next time there is a HP train running, I'll join to help speed up the process. 
---
Yeah you can make custom codes that look as if you actually have the item, which is why I never really understood why linking LI ever mattered lol. It would be a much better test imo atm if the leader just asked simple questions like, ‘To make sure we are maximizing everyone’s time here as this is an Exp group, can you please tell me what happens at 25% in the sabbatha fight? Ty!’. Can’t fake that as easily and also demonstrates knowledge of mechanics. Even if they just googled it right then they now know what happens which is a good thing lol. Not foolproof obviously but it’s better than tying up everyone’s guild hall decorations or asking for items you can fake link. Just my opinion xD.
---
It's pretty much a single player RPG, so yes, you'll be fine.
---
Doing daily quests plus Fractals takes me like 2hrs (maybe less) and I'm super inefficient, so it's totally possible.
---
I have 900+ LI just because I can't make myself do the provisional tokens, also the price of making the armor is putting me off
---
When I used to run fractals long ago I saw dps pugs getting downed at siax cm due to a combination of chip damage and social akwardness, and then wondering why they weren't being babysitted by our druid all the time.
---
However, what it didn't even cross their minds was that perhaps their &lt;10K dps wasn't enough to phase Siax fast enough in order to avoid damage and that the poor druid had to be far from the group kiting all the poisong that he was shiting, again, cause it just wasn't phasing.
---
To get a chance to kill the boss - you need to have at least 250 LIs. VG? 250 LIs. Cairn? 250 LIs. FRIGGIN CONVOY? 20 LIs or get kicked.
---
WoodenPotatoes has a pretty compelling argument on why easy mode would be bad for raiding. It boils down to anet would stop putting much effort into our current difficulty, or any effort into CMs, and easy mode would become the "new normal". He also doubts that there would be much conversion from easy -&gt; harder modes
---
Even savage/ex shit is easy to break into, and easier to recognize what's going on (imo)
---
agreed! 
---
PuG raids (Groups of all or mostly random players) don't have any real way of measuring an unknown player's actual experience and Legendary Insights are given for boss kills... Hense they are used as a proof of experience.  
---
It's an incredibly stupid system but for the vast majority of people, after the first boss kill or two it's about nothing more than loot.  So in that spirit, they want to know this isn't your first rodeo.  
---
Part of this fine example of pug raid leadershit is failing to grasp that his tokens of proof are a require component in making gear the guy who got kicked was wearing.  
---
As somebody who has been on both sides of this issue, just try to find yourself a stable group who are willing to work with you... And don't let yourself get suckered into being a raid leader.  Omfg.
---
Yeah I’ve had people like that too, between this and the WoW raid community it kind of made me realize that the whole set up of raids are not enjoyable for me.
---
So I just do general open world pve, some fractals and WvW. I find it more fun than structured raiding.
---
Wow what a elitist cotton-headed ninny muggins 
---
37k here.
---
I generall don't care about individual skill in fractals as long as you don't blantantly and repeatedly miss mechanics. In 100 regular it happens every now and then, at which point I ask if it's their first time in there. 
---
Knowing well that it can be taken differently, I would actually explain the mechanics if they said yes. They rarely do though, and after a few more wipes I'd tell them to read up on the mechanics, becuase after a dozen wipes because of bombs on Arkk, not pushing solar flares in a sane way, stuff like that, you can't tell me they know what they do.
---
I sadly don't have the killproofs to regularly join CM groups even though I can hold my own there just as well, or I would honestly never do 100 normal again. It's the worst place for these kinds of incidents.
---
&gt;	So yes, once you get the hang of it, it wasn’t hard at all.
---
Masterpiece of tautology.
---
"Once you practice doing something to the point that you can regularly succeed at it, you will be able to succeed at it regularly."
---
One day anet will implement a raid specific xp bar or something less cheeseable
---
They don’t like any comments that hint at being combative or accusatory.  Gotta play along with their tone game if you don’t want to get banned.
---
It's not
---
"I just came up on land to make sure you didn't get into trouble. It's not like I like you or anything!!"
---
Raid and T4
---
Drop armor/weapon and change stats in the mystic forge
---
I’m tempted to do that for the armour but knowing me I would just wardrobe it out and never wear the actual set lol.
---
Yeah those boys forced me to do the cannon &amp; wall chunk to the water method. So happy the bots drove me off of killing the mobs TBH.
---
That's some special kind of stupid. He must've never pug raided before.
---
Leggy armour is also kill proof for every HoT raid, so it's more valuable than LI alone.
---
Not the one you replied to, but for me it's not a job. I actually raided quite a lot with pugs after my Monday fullclear. I enjoyed them a lot. Now I only really Raid Monday for the fullclear and Wednesday for training new strats or training on the existing strats. I Raid because I can play with my guild and I've reached a point, where I've done each and every encounter so often, that it just became boring. This does include wing 6, which is a pretty cool wing imo but too little too late. I'm not the only one feeling that way. It's most of the 10 people in my guild. Some don't even log in, if it wouldn't be for the guild raids. 
---
You can. I gave up after five minutes and just did that about five times. 
---
Depends, if he doesnt have trinkets I'm assuming he is brand new. So he would need to get LS3 maps.
---
Zerker trinkets are cheap to get without em.
---
Not a bad idea. I'll definitely have to give  it a go when I next play. :)
---
I'm upset that that works as well as it does
---
You can downvote him but there's truth to it.
---
A lot of the balancing I keep up with is geared towards tuning raids. I regularly talk it over with other players who explain to me why such and such is changed because of this or that encounter. 
---
For gw2 and what the game was when I bought it at launch this is less than fun. I can see the value in why raids were added but the whole experience leaves a bad taste.
---
WoW has a less than nice community but the raiding scene in gw2 likes to take it up a notch in horrible behavior when they get the chance. No offense to those nice players that desperately try to get more people in raids. 
---
&gt;	They are viscous little bastards.
---
Yes. They are gooey little MFers.
---
You can, but making a mistake will still mean you get fucked over sometimes. Even the most experienced raiders fall victim to it sometimes, whether you were doing greens, using the old distortion share or the current scourge barriers. It's just that the more experienced you are, the less likely you are to make silly mistakes.
---
If you take several alts into the Maguuma and do Hero Points with them, you can progress the Mastery tracks as well. It's totally a thing to do.
---
I'm rather doubtful. Although the entirety of One Path Ends feels added on as an afterthought, it does pretty heavily suggest that Balthazar got the mirror from the reliquaries in Siren's Landing as it is known he showed up there **as Balthazar** in order to hide the last aspect of Lazarus so that his disguise wouldn't be foiled. This suggests that he knew of the mirror but didn't have it yet while he was working behind the scenes to take Lazarus's place until after he visited the reliquaries.
---
So Lyssa would have had no direct involvement in Balthazar getting that mirror. At most she told him about it, but chances are that all the gods know about most of what's in the others' reliquaries. Besides that, giving or talking about the mirror would indicate that she expected Balthazar to get free, but had no dealing with Rytlock and there is nothing to suggest there were other things ready to free Balthazar.
---
As long as your okay on missing out on certain ingame goals then yes, entirely. At what I'm assuming is basically two to three two hour sessions a week, your end game will basically be too erratic to ever craft a legendary, but you'll be able to be carried through a raid or two. 
---
I ran into somebody who had no hair...and no back of their head either because they grabbed one of these hair styles but Anet didn't let them keep it.  
---
Kinda wish I had an image of it to share now lol
---
This isn't the peak of the raiding community, this is one moron who doesn't realize Legendary Armor is 150 LI and that is all.  Everyone in the comments circle jerking with the raid hate are laughable.  The open world only players are by far the most toxic members of the GW2 community.
---
I think that's a big reason people are expecting the Wizard's Tower to be a raid. It's not central to the main story, but it's a fun idea to explore finally-- much like the Lair of Zommoros. And since, as stated above, a journal in that raid references Isgarren, I wouldn't be surprised if the raid team is picking up these lesser mysteries.
---
Once the tone of a post has been set, good luck not agreeing with it. You'll get downvoted no matter what and it happens pretty much in most subreddits if not all.
---
Best:  “catch the kegs” in the norn starting area.  Once you figure it out, it’s easy and tons of fun to watch people fail.
---
Pocket raptors are easy nowadays. At least for a soulbeast.
---
Unless your converting gems to gold, I don't see someone playing six hours a week getting a legendary ever..
---
LI are legendary insights, you get them as a reward weekly per raid boss. A lot of the raiding community sets restrictions on who can join based on how many LI they have to show "I've done these raids X times", so you're expected to ping that before hand to show that you have enough.
---
Legendary armor requires LI to craft, so by pinging legendary armor, that shows that they had over 250LI, but they just used it up before hand. The commander was being an asshat though and only accepted LI in its base form for some reason
---
I've always fake-pinged stuff in GW2. 
---
I mean, I was no asshole, I knew the fights and what to do with my class in every situation, but I pop in and out of the game and don't have ridiculous amounts of LIs.
---
It just sped up my raiding progress or Legendary armor progress by hell of a lot. 
---
The game's easy enough, if you know the fights, you don't need to prove you raid non-stop for months for you to get accepted.
---
But pugs will be pugs, and I don't blame them. I've seen the average player, I know how bad they are.. lol
---
There is that heart in Frostsound Gorge where you help the Dredge with the revolution that is just downright revolting. You are forced to use a mining suit that deals 0 damage, so instead you have to just press F a hundred times for 0 progress or press 5 near other Dredge, which has a 30sec cooldown for no reason.
---
 Amusingly enough there is a similar heart somewhere else in the Shiverpeaks where you are supposed to use a Steam Creature disguise to instigate fights between Steam Creatures and Dredge. But in that heart you can just ignore it and normally can kill Dredge, which is decidely faster.
---
There is also a heart in Ascalon where you are supposed to fight Ogres, but due to the Ogre event chain, you are instead often stuck picking up scrap metal for 5 minutes.
---
During another heart in Sparkfly fen you are supposed to test new weapons on Awakened, killing them normally awards no progress. For some bizzare reason these weapons, have a global cooldown on their skills, that triggers AFTER a cast has completed which makes them non-stop cancel themselves. However killing Krait normally awards progress towards the heart, and there is a krait invasion event that finishes the heart in a few seconds.
---
The best hearts are all in Siren's landing. Pull 5 Awakened and leyline Mob, AoE down, purify, done.
---
The hearts in PoF and beyond are all just terrible. Every single one of them requires you to do 3 steps for 0 progress, and mobs somehow arerr always precisely outside the boundaries of the heart. Just let me bruteforce ffs. I have base map completion on 16 characters and I will never do PoF on a second.
---
Ahhr, sorry, the "although I've done Nightmare, multiple times before, and although the LFG never said they were going to do Nightmare CM." made it sound like you've only done normal.  
---
Putting **steal** into lifesteal.
---
LEVITATING SHARK OF LEVITATING AWESOMENESS
---
 A chain is only as strong as its weakest link
---
This is like another language for those who don't raid.
---
Dont' forget that Reaper uses a scythe as a weapon when in reaper's shroud.
---
Fair enough. I enjoy raiding with my guild but we're still learning. Every run is a training run and an opportunity to get better. I imagine eventually we may get to a point where it becomes stale and boring, but we're still far from that.
---
Congratulations, it really is a very satisfying mount to have that really pays off the more you put into learning how to control it.  While I'm not at anywhere near the level of fancy flying that you see in some of the videos posted here just getting all the masteries unlocked gives you so much freedom of movement in the sky.
---
The entire story is beatable solo except maybe Mordremoth (HoT story last boss) for new players. PoF last boss Balthazar might take a few tries but not that hard.
---
I'd say the real boon for Necromancer is just having almost permanent life force with good add control.  Whether you're playing Reaper or Scourge you're just rolling in life force tbh... 
---
I just don't often do Nightmare CM without a group I trust, which well, means every PUG group :)
---
You are right and they obviously like to give advice in general or they wouldn't. And it probably makes them feel good. I just was curious if people have had the same thing happen. 
---
Yeah, the holosmith part was more of a "gripe" section than a "fix" section. I agree that holosmith is very good, but the rest of engi doesn't really compare.
---
The only real "special" things about scrapper are the 2 situational gyros and thats it. Almost everything else the Holosmith can do. which makes me sad. with the other classes the specializations are a trade off. But I feel like for engi there is almost no point in playing something besides Holosmith.
---
The single kit thing is a huge change to engi's mechanic yeah. Definitely didn't expect it to be implemented but was interesting to think about. I was think about a hammer scrapper with tool kit (pref my revised one) with all the normal turrets, which would be REALLY strong and probably unbalanced.
---
I'm curious of what you thought of the other changes to the tool kit abilities.
---
But thanks for reading the post and dissecting it a bit. I like people like you. Have a great day!
---
27k AP here, I think I have done about 4 low level fractals, wouldn't know what to do anyway.
---
Achievement points means literally shat.
---
I love the charr, but I have deleted characters that I have chosen Ash for, simply because as I was playing them, my choice reminded me of that heart and I started to hate the characters themselves. I hate that heart so much.
---
For weapons, I'd advise doing the specialization collections, can get them done in a day or two.
---
Armor wise, there is "sun is silent for this one", "bioluminescence", and the leystone armor collection.
---
Some raid training guilds are cool with exotics.
---
Also crafting. It's time gated though, since you can only craft certain pieces once a day.
---
Laurels, living world season maps, some achievements and fractals/pvp/wvw can get you trinkets. 
---
I should show this post to a friend of mine. His logic is that he can get around everywhere he needs with the other mounts so he doesn't need the griffin.
---
It isn't about need. It's about joy. 
---
sorry but without gear inspect we need some way to keep the bads out
---
the entire personal story is soloable including expansions and living world releases.
---
what's nice about GW2 in it's current state for new users is that it's fairly easy to start up and it just expands as you learn the various systems in play.  All of this while being able to enjoy the festival events going on like Lunar New Year right now.
---
Once you get to 80 things basically open up into a choose-your-goals game.  Whether it's working on new collections/gear/achieves or just moving on to the expansion/living world content.  While you can blitz your way through everything the game can also be enjoyed in a more relaxed pace without feeling like you are missing out on things, minus the heavy activity in the latest living world map in the first couple months after it's initial release.
---
people who fake killproof should uninstall
---
now THAT is toxic behavior 
---
Mawdrey at least was fun to make though
---
No, people don't raiding because they don't like putting effort into things, and use this as an excuse 
---
One of my friends bought/was playing PoF for almost a year before I finally returned to the game, yet he only grabbed the Raptor by starting the PoF storyline and was mostly content with that. I managed to get all mounts, Griffon and Beetle included, in a couple months of casual playing, and offered to get him through the process of obtaining at least all base mounts...we went for Springer and he decided it was too much work after getting Springer, and went back to changing his hairstyle on his Mesmer...
---
Some people have serious commitment issues or are easily overwhelmed, sadly.
---
No one tell them, shush.
---
Oh wow.
---
But... the core mounts are needed to play the actual expansion... and you get them during the story... what was he doing for a year? 
---
That's disengenuous to say the least.
---
I can repsect that some people have limited time in their day for a game, but this issue is pervasive throughout the community. I have a harder time believing this is due to 3/4 of the community having less than 1-2 hours free time than I do believing that its just a culture of minmaxers cheesing their way through a game and then complaining their burnt once they have 1000+ Li.
---
I feel like my scourge has worse LF management than my Reaper did back in hot
---
overwhelmed by just doing a heart? o.O
---
Do people actually think 250 gold is a lot? And what "sheer amount of grind required" is there? It's like an hour long collection, probably less time with a guide.
---
Do you even know what the word grind means?
---
These spots are popular for people that craft daily ascended cool downs since platinum and iron in particular are the two mats they use the most and we don't get through casual play. 
---
I like the one in gendarren fields
---
The NA one isn't much better...
---
Too many trainees and not enough trainers. There are fairly frequent impromptu runs started but very little true training and unless you are watching the discord like a hawk you're likely to be too late to join the runs.
---
It's part of why I occasionally post my own group in LFG stating "new raiders welcome" or "no exp required". This of course leads to a bunch of people like in OP joining and then throwing a fit because I'm explaining the fight to the new raiders. I've also been asked "how do you expect to get a kill without any experience". I think I broke that person's brain when I told them, "the same way people learned to begin with... By going in and experiencing the mechanics and learning from doing."
---
He'd log in, spend about twenty minutes changing his hair, then do a little exploration in base Tyria (like 1-2 hearts, total), then go back to doing his character's hair or log off. This process lasted 3 hours some days. I tried to be patient with him and his inability to complete much in a single sitting before breaking out the hairstyle kit, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a relief when he decided to take a break from the game and I could go at my own pace to get shit done.
---
I got all all PoF mounts (not LS Beetle) when he went afk for a couple weeks. He logged back in, asked how I got them all "so fast," and then went about playing with his permanent hair kit again. Then got Beetle in a day while he was away for a weekend because he had friends over.
---
I can't get anything done when we play together honestly. Hence it being a relief.
---
This is just confirmation bias more than anything. If every raider was like this nobody would ever raid, the fact that this even gets attention should tell you how much of a black sheep this is.
---
Well he isn't wrong. GW1 was miles better
---
I agree with everything said so far. What keeps the game fun for me is working toward specific achievement tracks (in the Achievements pane of the Hero window), which are sort of like GW2's version of side-quests. You'll get exclusive items and titles through the achievements that sometimes get deeper into the back-story and world lore. It's a fun reason to explore parts of the world at your leisure that you might have missed, and it's a motivation to group up with other players via the LFG to take down difficult challenges.
---
My favorite heart. Think it's the most creative and interractive heart in the game and would have more like that one.
---
It is a lot for a casual, after 6 years of playing on and off I barely had 170 gold. It looked like a grind when looking at a guide. I agree it's not really, once you actually do it. The hardest part of the collection was finding groups for the events. I had to put up a squad myself in the end.
---
Unfortunately the bad ones stick out in my mind more than the good ones. Lake Doric renown hearts are tediously slow, especially when it comes to fighting the White Mantle mobs.
---
For a good, recent experience I'd mention the Thunderhead Peaks renown hearts. They go pretty quickly and having alternatives to killing mobs for decent progression is nice.
---
I'm not quite sure what you're trying to get at as it is just something I explained from my point of view and you seem to be trying your absolute best to counter that and scare other people from just trying it for once.
---
Whenever someone is ready to raid, I assume most people already have somewhat experience from fractals, where many of the raid mechanics are taught in their basic form.
---
I mean, wiping only 8 times on arguably one of the hardest raid bosses and then managing to succeed without too much hassle on my very first try inside a raid instance is something I would hardly consider 'practice'...
---
Your attitude is exactly the kind of attitude that keeps people away from raiding. Let people try. Let people wipe. But most of all, let people practice in a safe environment.  
---
If I only had 3-6 hours a week - I'd stay away from MMORPGs. You need much more time to fully enjoy this genre. 
---
I'd rather play few matches of moba/battle royale/csgo/hearthstone/whatever, but not mmorpg. 
---
This is my honest opinion, but it's up to you anyway. 
---
Eheh
---
I know that so many people detest the "Train with the Militia" heart, especially since sometimes its during their first toon they will encounter this heart. But I kind of like it. The mechanics are interesting in the sense that the sword and shield exercise actually try to teach you to be attentive to NPC cues. But, when I'm doing it in faceroll mode, I just spam the rifle one until complete :)
---
Ahahah !! Thanks for your input. That was great :)
---
And the paper bag helmets! 
---
Name checks out.
---
Checked the edits. Clean nvidia install is a good thing to try. Good luck! 
---
Funny thing about the titular "Guild" Wars is that it is referring to the warring NPC faction guilds, rather than player guilds.
---
Do the following 'raids' weekly.  I put it in quotes because they are incredibly easy.  Do these weekly to earn magnetite shards, use the shards to buy armor/weapons.  For trinkets, either get raid drops from these events, or living world season 3 maps.  
---
\-escort (wing 3, first LI)
---
\-twisted castle (wing 3, third LI)
---
\-spirit woods (wing 1, 2nd LI)
---
\-trio (wing 2, 2nd LI)
---
\-mursaat overseer (wing 4, 2nd LI)  
---
Damn, you just reminded me of some nasty ones indeed.
---
I never try to get map completion objectives w/o the Guild Buff. But even there, 10% feels like nothing when faced with the most unwavering of progression fills... 
---
I moved the files where stated in GW2 folder. I launched the game via Lutris. I left esync turned on and removed the DX9single flag.
---
Thank you :)
---
I keep hearing people referring to those as some good ones - perhaps I'll revisit them in an alt; it's been a while since I scrambled a new toon across Tyria :)
---
Yeah completely agreed. I must have saved up approximately 400 gold with no aim in mind, so it made sense to put it towards the griffin.
---
And yeah haha, map travel with the griffin vastly outweighs armour skins in the long run. 
---
For the record, having a job and doing money to gold is much much higher rate of income.  I know, it sucks that gaming turned into this, but if you don't want to grind for 20-25 hours, consider it.  
---
Go condi short bow soulbeast. Easiest rotation and does enough damage to kill things.
---
The meta events are often indicated with orange text in the box on the right. Check the LFG as well. 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Event_timers might also be of some help. 
---
I'm also interested in this but dont want to join any groups in fear of screwing over others lol. What's the best beginner way to start working on exotics? I've been doing lower level dungeons just to get a feel for them over WOW 
---
I play maybe a few weeks every year, not constantly. 4-5 years ago gold was much harder to get, only in recent years it started to become easier, but then I took a break. Not everyone plays this game 24/7 ;) I guarantee you that most casual players don't even have 100g. 
---
Why do birds blind....
---
So annoying
---
We may not like it but this is PEAK raiding performance.
---
Awesome, thanks.
---
Speaking of Hero Points, do some of the challenges in the expansions require a group? So far I’ve only done 2 or 3 while doing the story, but I ran across one that seemed impossible solo. 
---
I usually did try running off to work on something. He'd follow and ask me to look at his hair. "Color A or Color B?" sort of deal. So even if I was making progress, it was stop-and-go at best (I didn't want to be rude or snap at him over it). Starting zone maps that shouldn't take longer than 45~60 minutes with even just Raptor to complete were taking over 3 hours, and I'd only finish because he'd log out finally.
---
He's my friend, and I completely agree that there are many ways to have fun in the game...but any amount of effort (fractals, metas, heck going after simple achievements to get aesthetic unlocks) was too much after ~10 minutes, and then out came the hair kit. And it was a relief that he decided to give the game a break because of it lmao
---
Thanks, will do.
---
Honestly, if you're just doing regular PvE content for the most part, you may just want to make sure your 80s have full lvl 80 exotic to start with just so you have the right armor for your farming stages.  
---
I started the Ascended process pretty recently. I will say that one of the first things to do is decide what kind of stats you're looking to get out of your gear.
---
Once you know that, you're probably gonna want to start with trinkets.  If you have LS3, Bitterfrost Frontier and Siren's Landing are the easiest to farm.  This will get you a ring and an earring (from Winterberry farming in BFF) and a backpiece (from Orrian Pearl farming in Siren's Landing).  Fire Orchid Blossoms in Draconic Mons is probably the next easiest and that will net you another ring.   You can also get necklaces from Pearls and Blossoms. Jade Shards (backpiece, necklace) in Lake Doric, Bloodstone Rubies (ring, backpiece, necklace) in Bloodstone Fen, and Petrified Wood (Earring, Backpiece) in Ember Bay tend to be longer farms (especially the Petrified Wood) but are still an option
---
I mention these primarily because they have the most varied stat selection, however, if you're only looking for core stats, you can buy earrings, rings and necklaces for laurels, or if you're running fractals, rings will frequently drop in fractal encryptions.
---
BTW, you can also get an ascended waterbreather from Bitterfrost Frontier, but that's not going to be as necessary for you at this stage.
---
I did weapons after that because it required less mats than armor.  You'll want to work on leveling the appropriate crafting discipline(s) to 500 while saving up the materials you'll need. Also, get in the habit of making crafting the time-gated materials as part of your daily routine until you have enough stocked - you'll unlock those recipes on the way to 500.
---
Waiting for ascended equipment to drop as loot is not worth it at all.  I've had a couple pieces drop, but they were in stat sets that were not particularly useful to my characters (and account bound so I couldn't just sell them off).
---
20-25 for a set of armor which will remain best indefinitely is nothing compared to other MMOs which require far more time investment (talking bout months and even years)  to get best gear. 
---
Nah. If it was just a money thing, they would have released as soon as they were ready, so the revenue could accrue interest.
---
There was a case where one of Zhaitan's minions had a free willed spirit that was independent of it's undead body. I'd say that there aren't any set rules depending on the needs of the story. 
---
&gt; Saying ArenaNet would just give up on the harder difficulties is just dumb, they wouldn't bother with easy mode in the first place if that was the case.
---
Considering they haven't bothered with easy mode thus far, maybe it isn't so dumb and is in fact the case?
---
Uhh, I guess you forgot all of Ember Bay?

Dagger is off-hand baseline on Ranger. Soulbeast added Dagger to mainhand. I don't run Axe (which is recommended by SnowCrows) because it doesn't work for me. I spent level 1-80 trying to make off-hand axe work and I just Do. Not. Get. It. Sure, post-80, and especially Raiding is very different. But running Dagger main-hand is fine, and Shortbow is fine per the meta, I had all the correct runes, sigils, attributes, etc...but that darn off-hand Dagger, that was the one thing that "prevented" me from joining the training for raids.
---
It was a 97% perfect Snowcrows build save that dagger, hence the "stick in the mud" comment. Either it perfectly matches what's on Snowcrows, or people flip about "letting you" raid.
---
The holy grail of GW2 gearing.
---
You gotta understand, you joined a group that was possibly already pretty good, and wasn't a pug group.  Xera in particular is annoying because you can't be reactive to the encounter, you have to have it memorized and be proactive.  Example, 'I know the only safe place to tank in 20 seconds is this location, so tell my dps to clear those shards now'.  Then, the dps players need to realize that the most important thing to do, is clear those shards, not dps the boss.  Unfortunately, in a full pug group, everyone wants to judge everyone else's boss dps.  So no one wants to lower their own personal boss dps to do that mechanic, as low boss dps can result in being kicked.  The best way to experience raiding, is with a group of friends who all trust each other.  When I'm with my static as a dps, the second its time to start clearing shards, I move off the boss and do only that (or as condi bs, cleave with zerker f1), I never worry that I will be kicked for low boss dps due to doing a mechanic.  The pug substitute for that type of trust, is trust built with pinging a butt load of LI.  
---
Yes, there's a number of Hero Points in both expansions that are group oriented. There are HP trains (40+ players) that run often (moreso in HoT) that go through the zones and do all hero points, so as long as you keep an eye on LFG you shouldn't have trouble finding a group.
---
They only start mentioning him once you begin the PoF story. Definitely a bit of a spoiler, but it's been out for a long time now.
---
Did he have a permanent stylist contract or did he just sink an inordinate number of gems into the game?
---
are you sure it isn't female norn?
---
I've been exploring this error for YEARS now. I have tried absolutely every solution I've come across There are a lot of different documented causes out there, some GW2 itself, some Nvidia, others RAM. Theres a specific windows DLL the crash is linked with as well, and I've seen similar issues documented in other MMOs as well. In my case this remains entirely unsolved. I've clean installed GW2, Nvidia drivers, swapped RAM slots and adjusted clocks, no luck at all. I've reinstalled windows, run days of ram stability tests, replaced windows dll's, run in compatibility modes, without addons, etc. (Probably 100 other fixes as well)
---
Sometimes my game can go hours without crashing, other times it is every 10 minutes. I think it's most likely some kind of compatibility issue between GW2 and some piece of my hardware. I can run all kinds of burn in and stability tests without issue though, so I have no reason to go out and buy new hardware. 
---
Anyways, I'm personally stuck living with it at this point. Best of luck in your hunt for a solution and let me know if you find anything!
---
Unless u use elixer u or blast gyro tool belt skills you don’t actually bring much superspeed anymore. You probably wont run U because PoP is taken over HgH and blast gyro is too derpy to really be taken for its toolbelt, but it’s not unheard of.
---
He has a permanent hairstyle contract from buying gems to buy BLC keys
---
I always ask for 10million kp, it's never failed to get good people.
---
good for you, i wouldn't trust a group led by a person with such poor math skills to be any good. the guy doesn't even know how to use the compact function in the inventory if his li stacks are any indication so i wouldn't trust him with any mechanic that needs the minimum of attention.
---
Over the last week I've been playing with a group of friends who are all new to GW2 and we like to do T4 fractals together for fun (even though I'm the only one with agony resist). We did Siren's reef for the first time yesterday and they enjoyed it a lot more than all the other fractals we've done (which is most of them), probably because they could actually contribute in a meaningful way without getting gimped by agony (by helping throw the bags around - if you throw it fast enough, you don't get agony). I don't think it's too bad compared to the others - the treasure gathering part was an interesting gameplay experience that couldn't even be portal-cheesed, although all the knockbacks during the boss fights (and adds that stood on the side that you couldn't hit as melee without taking the poison soup damage) was quite annoying.
---
Oh, and also how you have the additional task of clearing out the pirate ship every time wipe or /GG during the additional treasure collection parts was a nuisance as well.
---
Oh. It basically doesn't do anything, just a confirmation that you're experienced?
---
I found particularly funny when their LI are faked and they are actually someone who started a group to get in a group, since they think no one will ask the commander about proof.
---
when is daily/weekly reset?
---
I did, too! I was opening some groups to newbies with the whole description like "wanna learn fractals? come have some fun with T1s" and got a dude all pissed that the party wiped.
---
So do you like legitimately need hundreds of kills to get in? Someone said it's 1 LI per boss, wouldn't that take like...ages?
---
I thought WoWs needing to kill the boss once for the achievement was bad enough.
---
Id take an exotic geared dps who knows their mechanics and a decent rotation over an ascended geared player flailing on keys and not knowing the fight in ANY of my squads.
---
You can't.
---
You can't also turn off names for squads in PvE.
---
So when all you need is the HP bar, you are forced to deal with the whole thing.
---
If it's a hero point that needs a group, it'll usually spawn an event associated with the hero point. That event will advertise whether it's a group event or otherwise.
---
A good rule of thumb for HoT is that any hero point that spawns an event is *usually* a group event. There are some hero points (like the infamous Balthazar's Rest point in Auric Basin) that isn't actually a group event hero point, but there's an event that spawns next to it that *is* a group event. You can actually circumvent that particular event if you have stealth, but you have to scoot over to the hero point and channel ASAP.
---
I'm so bemused. It takes so little effort to get the mounts, this is next level laziness! You're a better friend than I would be ^^
---
Oh yeah hit me up. I've tried most of the things you have at this point. I'm addicted to PvP and was keen on getting to top 10-25 again for once so it'd suck if I suddenly had to live with this. It randomly started happening 2 patches ago, though. Never before that, and I've had the same hardware for a l o n g time. Something leads me to believe it's an issue with Guild Wars, if anything
---
Phantasms have long cast times and dont hit instantly either compared to other bursty dps skills in the game. Same goes for shatters, gotta wait till they run up to the enemy first. Phantasms and clones can just be finicky. It's way easier to jump into a crowd as a reaper and soul spiral everything to death in a few seconds rather than jump in and try to use single target phantasms on different enemies (aside from some phantasms like greatsword) and then shatter. If anyone is near you, shit winds up dying before your phantasm even hits at all and you get no credit for the kill. I wind up using auto attack and sword skill 2 more than anything to cleave and tag enemies. 
---
At the end of the day these are open world problems and dont mean much at all but there are just other classes that are better and smoother at handling the trash mobs of tyria.
---
Here is what I (and almost everyone else here) recommend.
---
First, get your needed crafting skill to 500. Focus on one class for now, then once you've gotten them geared, focus on another class. And I'm gonna be blunt and say stick to Berserker stats for a while, as it is cheaper to stat swap to another stat you want instead of outright crafting it, especially those HoT and PoF stats. 
---
Once you've hit 500, make sure you are doing the daily crafting mats. You can only make 1 of these ingredients a day, and they are expensive to buy, so make sure you do it every day. From here, you really have a few options. You can craft the gear directly (highly recommended), or you can craft marks and use the relevant marks to buy the gear from Fractal, PvP, or WvW vendors. I would only recommend this route if you literally only do one of these activities, otherwise, do the former. 
---
I'd focus on weapons first, as they are going to provide the biggest increase in damage, and are more accessible to every class (Sword, GS, staff). 
---
Truth be told though, the damage increase is slight, so don't rush it. It only matters when you need the extra Agony Resistance for pushing higher tier fractals. You can raid and do every solo content in exotic gear just fine. The best benefit, IMHO, for ascended gear is it being account bound, so you can have a fully geared Warrior, Guardian, and Rev with just a trip to the bank (though runes and sigils may not be the best depending on what you''re doing).
---
Get a hang of the game again, check out the changes, the new story (you can get some ascended gear via story achievements and collections!), and see what you want to do as well. I have a couple guildies who got the game when PoF launched and they are still working on ascended gear, but each at their own pace because just grinding out gold and mats can be demoralizing, especially if ascended gear isn't as necessary as people think. I'd rather have someone in my fractal group who knows how to play with just enough AR to survive, than someone who is in full legendary/ascended gear who keeps going down. Skill matters way more than gear.
---
Zhaitan does look undeniably impressive, yeah :D 
---
Mostly it's the npcs repeating and repeating and repeating and "no, try attacking when I LOWER my guard!" I'm sure I enjoyed it the first few times, but I have completed that map SO MANY TIMES!!! And helped other people complete it! It's the worst!!! at least in core tyria! 
---
It's especially worse in this case because it's the final fight with the main boss of the game, the stakes were at their supposed highest. It would only make sense to offer a really challenging experience which is actually fun, this was just. Press a button and dodge some spit every few seconds. It was really disappointing lol.   
---
Yeah I've started HoT since finishing this, it's been quite the ride. &gt;!Eir just died :(  !&lt;
---
Since others have answered your question, I'll leave r/GuildWarsDyeJob here for you to check out, some people have awesome looking characters and share them here.
---
What makes it fun for me is that there's a lot of things to do, and a lot of ways to do them.
---
As for "the final boss", there's so many final bosses in all of the content that one has to be very specific.
---
Some final bosses are really cool, but a few like the final boss of the personal story can be underwhelmingly mindbogglingly boring.  
---
Here's hoping they eventually find the time to reintroduce Season 1 of the Living world story and rework the final boss of the personal story.
---
This. This all day. 
---
It's like, I'm happy to explain something to you and take that extra 2 min. just fucking ask. 
---
Can't agree more....
---
Daily reset is at 4:00 p.m. PST, and will change to 5:00 p.m. PST when day lights saving ends for those who observe it.
---
Weekly reset is Tuesdays when Daily reset happens. 
---
This is a profoundly embarrassing question, but my OCD is making me ask it.
---
I recently came back after being away 5 years. Bought the expansions and having a lot of fun. However, I re-rolled a few of my characters so that I wouldn't get overwhelmed. Yes, I deleted 3 6-year-old characters after clearing out their mailboxes. :/
---
A few days later, I realized that there'd likely be a 7th birthday present, and I'd just preemptively thrown away 3 of them! Oops. The question is: is it worth it to try to get the characters restored? Or would their "new birthday" be the date of restoration? Has this happened to anybody else?

500 on the craftings you need then go wvw and crafting marks, and of course just crafting if you got the gold
---
*walks into room to find naked Lord Faren standing there*
---
Um...
---
*illusion dissolves, crazed White Mantle Mesmer girl attacks me*
---
UMMMM....
---
It might not feel like it at first, but once you start getting into ascended gear and start doing raids and whatnot, you'll have more ascended stuff than you know what to do with. 
---
Biggest pro tip I have for crafting is craft what is cheap, and stat swap. You can save a TON of gold that way
---
We'd like raiders to stop doing things that make us hate them.
---
Even with only a few weeks getting gold is pretty easy. Just do some fractals, wvw, raids, or, God forbids, dungeons

It's even more embarassing when you realise they not only exist, but also reproduce, live stable life and most likely are happier than you.
---
I mean yeah if they’re asking for 1500 you’re screwed but if you have 250 and they’re asking for like 500 or so you’re ok 
---
Yeah. I understand now. 
---
Or the evasion of it. 
---
But yeah, obviously there's more to Verdant Brink than those ankle biters. 
---
31k AP. I did more dailies than you, so I'm better! 
---
If i play 2h a day, I can maybe run all T1 fractals (remember, casual, can't do T3-4). That's maybe 2-4 gold a day, so about 30-50 over the few weeks I play each year. Stop thinking that everyone has full ascended and can play 8 hours a day.
---
Yeah, personally I do a mix.  I like farming in game somtimes, but sometimes I'd rather just skip it.  Plus, anytime Anet does an update that I like, I always throw them $10, and I've pretty much run out of gemstore stuff I want.  
---
I can believe in "dozens". But not "hundreds".
---
Does symbolic avenger stack?
---
Tbh if your friends have laptops they can probably play the game. It’s been out for so long that even older laptops can run it fairly well. I play mine on a 4 year old MacBook pro if that says anything. 
---
MMO’s never get much traction on consoles anyways. 
---
You can find a list of all reset times [here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Server_reset)
---
why?
---
That was the biggest point people criticize about the story, since then Anet improved a lot, the final battle of the HoT was better than Zhaitan (buggy but definitely better) and PoF final battle is WAY better than both and currently the last fight of the last episode of season 4 is a master piece.
---
Can you ping me on discord (Angeels#0001) I might be able to help get you some perma passes for the winners.
---
That particular individual / everyone? Highly doubt it.
---
Statistically / on average? I expect more people grasp at least the basics at 500 li than at 250 li than at 100 li. Judging from the levels of clownfiesta I've seen around that's quite reasonable. 
---
Im pretty sure its a mispell for [Daifuku](https://images.japancentre.com/recipes/pics/1669/main/matcha-daifuku.jpg?1521473958)

not worth the stress imo. unless you already have 9 close friends.
---
Hi, new player here. Can someone explain some of the common abbreviations you all use in map chat and whatnot? Thanks. Sorry if this is a dumb question lol
---
I sort of agree with this, but also if everything is spelled out, every time, it's hard to see people becoming more engaged rather than less.
---
That goes for both new players (who don't develop curiosity as a result), and older players (who get cranky and refuse to explain when asked a question). It impacts both sides.
---
Be willing to answer questions when asked, if you know. Be willing to ask questions about things you don't.
---
This may sound silly but actually re-naming gw2 launcher solved my problem
---
yeah that final battle was disappointing but i believe it is because there was supposed to be a final fight against zhaitan after he hit the ground that was cut for some reason. there is a poi(poin of interest) in arah that you can't access and the community supposed that final fight was supposed to have happened there. but still the expansions and living story pick up the slack so look forward to those and welcome to the endgame i guess!
---
Newsflash, nobody stops you from making those groups. 
---
You can cry all day about how their "gatekeeping" stops you from playing the game but... it doesn't. 
---
It's mostly for tutorials. I think you should spell it out at least once before abbreviating
---
I agree that we need some motivation on winning the week. Seasons were fun... but burned people out. As for the outnumber buff, it's fine as is. Why prevent dead servers glory of stealing objectives? If anything they should get a slight buff for playing outnumbered. The relink shit needs a adjustment. Giving overstacked servers a link... should never happen. *Looks at BG* Closing servers at anytime could screw the link up. Keeping it so that server hoppers don't get pips for a week is harsh enough. We need more wvw events, golem week, double ppk, and no downstate was amazing fun. 
---
Sure thanks for the attempt. 
---
I hate how people keep using abbreviation on the internet, its not like youre using limited texting and youre using keyboard not Nokia 6300. I remember on WoW the community keep calling the mage rotation like AP&gt;PoM&gt;AB&gt;AM&gt;ABar&gt;ABL.
---
heck i play since 1 months after release and i still dont even know the skills and abiltiy names. I know meteor shower and lava font and thats it, the rest are #3 fire #3mesmerscepter etc... and dont even started with trait.
---
&gt; There's also the idea that Lyssa could be two entities, but that's a whole other bag of what-ifs, so I'll leave that where it is.
---
Lyssa is the composite diety of Lyss and Ilya- which is still technically canonical in GW2's lore with the Lyss and Ilya pistols. 
---
A pet theory of mine is that Lyssa split their opinions with the exodus of the gods. One part of them, maybe the one who favoured Chaos (as is typical in mesmer magic) might've stayed to watch the whole world burn down due to the elder dragons- or the wrath of a war god, while the other left- maintaining the facade (read: Illusion) of a full Lyssa in order to trick the other gods. 
---
Of course, this means that there's a half of Lyssa is running around sowing chaos in our world because it's fun. It's definitely a frayed string in comparison to the neat little lore bow that the other gods have pulled. 
---
Newsflash, someone felt called out and retaliated poorly 🙃
---
"It was specifically pointed out that Primordus and Jormag absorbed Zhaitan's and Mordremoth's powers. That also was reflected on their minions as both Destroyers and Icebrood had weird appearances."
---
I forgot about the Death Branded that first made appearance in S4 Ep 4. Ember Bay had changed Destroyers.
---
It was just an example to show the different abbreviations.
---
What language is this?
---
Would really like to konw what happens when you put effort on a picture then! This is fantastic :D
---
So are penalized then for spending your LI towards items if you had 250, but no longer do?
---
Nah. Portaling people to places is the main reason why I made a mesmer, helping him was fun.  
---
He's the kind of person who only plays a few hours a week when someone's playing with him, and continuing the story was more fun than grinding for \~15 minutes to get a mount.
---
LI is a material for the legendary raidarmor. You get 1 per kill.
---
Just play an easy dps class at the start to learn stuff. 
---
I would go with dragonhunter, equip the class buy food and practize 1 hour at the golem (rotation). From there you can jump into trainings (lfg)

I thought about that honestly, but I can't see Anet pulling all the strings for just one dragon. Though, It would be apt for a story that launched with a god to end with a god..
---
Ya lmao. They expect you to have so much that you could have crafted everything you need and still have multiple stacks.

You'll be fine without a "how to play engineer for new players" video. You will learn easier if you spammed all your buttons and see what each of them does. All you are going to do is press buttons that hits harder than auto-attack which is usually skills that aren't Crowd control or supporting(buff or healing). There is no forced complex interaction in skills for example, "x skill can't be used unless you use it after you use y skill." However, here is a video about [Combo Fields/Finisher.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SznERJ85I_Y) It isn't specific to engineer but it can help you play better. After all, Engineer is a very combo field and finisher heavy class. 
---
Since you are low level, if you need a engineer leveling guide:
---
* Put all your Hero points in Kit. This will give you the most diverse range of skills to use. If kits doesn't interest you, you can use anything you like. But make sure it is either Kit, Elixir, or Turret because it will give you an elite skill. If a certain utility skill interest you, then go ahead and spend some hero points to acquire it. But don't spend too much points on utility skills because you need to save it for your first specialization.
---
* After getting an elite + utility skills, save all your hero points. Pick a first specialization/trait and put all your points into it. Do not put any points into anything else. I recommend to choose either Firearms or explosives. Both have traits that gives general dps increase and it isn't niche to specific skill lines. 
---
* After getting one of them, put all your hero points for the other specialization/traits. You will unlock a second specialization/traitllne at level 45. 
---
* Once you unlocked everything in your second specialzation, you are free to put your points anywhere you want. You will unlock your third specialization at level 71, even if you don't unlock an entire full specialization yet, most of the hero points are skewed to be earned greatly at the level 70s anyways and you are going to be level 80 soon.
---
Hey! I started hearing ascended roughly one month ago for fractals . I’m now at AR 134 , only have my shoes and chest left to get . Rings trinkets  best to farm for winter berries from ls3 I believe them . I got my weapons from doing the pof achievements and stat swapped what I needed. Then I leveled crafting and crafted rest! Lower level fractals will give you good money and resources coming in . You will get a lot of ring drops from there as well ! 
---
Thanks for the help! I want to start my fractals but never see a group for Fractals 1 lol. And I do t want to lead a group since I have no idea what I'm doing lol
---
Seems rather elitist to demand 8+ months of experience (4 ish for a stack and another batch for full set of gear + misc). I feel like there are better ways to to communicate ones experience or request thereof. Are people so adverse to conversation?
---
VG is a really weird boss. This week it took my static group 30 mins to get past it. Then I took a training group with half the group 0 experience through and killed it in 1 pull. We aren't even a tryhard dps static, but sometimes small mistakes or small rng can cause a cascade failure.
---
Soulbeast is good and bursty. The rest of your comment is only true if you're playing low tier fractals or have a very skilled PUG. Druids make almost every single t4 encounter easier and also faster because their healing + boon application rewards hyper-aggressive play (i.e., stacking).
---
And this, guys, is why i don't raid at all.
---
I like the potion-mixing one as well. It's fun to see what will happen with the different combinations if you don't look at the wiki ahead of time.
---
So far, I've only trained Healing Turret to help with sustain, but I had planned to go mainly Kit.  Throwing grenades and using a flamethrower sounds fun.  
---
Thank you for the tips!
---
Whats the best thing to get with Black lion statuettes?
---
Yeah I'm sure someone who raided enough to make legendary armour and is still raiding wants to make people hate raids. Obviously. 
---
[Check this guide.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g7zlH3pVPvW21WIh5-qL-IXDeABtJzIqnZYXP8tCcM0/edit)
---
Hmm... What did you see?
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Abbreviations might help. 
---
The only one I didn't see on that was gg which is either "good game" or a special command to kill your character, often used as a quick way to reset if a fight goes badly wrong and you're all going to die anyway. 
---
Now that d912dxy has been out for a few days, how common are people finding crashes to be?
---
What raid hate? Unless "This is why I don't raid" counts as hate now.
---
&gt;Everyone in the comments circle jerking with the raid hate are laughable. The open world only players are by far the most toxic members of the GW2 community.
---
You sound pretty toxic yourself tbh. There is very little raid hate here. 
---
I like Siren's Reef for one reason: It's blessedly short compared to fucking deepstone. You're way over-stating the difficulty of some of the fights. Bristlebacks are fucking hilarious when your druid puts a staff 5 in front of them: machinegun heals for the group. I'm afraid if you're having issues with a few vets on t4s that's kind of a git gud issue. Bonebreakers have ridiculously small break bars, you only need to tap them with something and they will get stunned. They will also stun if they collide with any object--including the shoreline. The only way you'll die to these is if you're being utterly careless.
---
As for the smokescales, they're entirely predictable. The smoke circle doesn't make them invulnerable, it makes you blind. Stand outside the circle and lure the smokescale out of it, use a knockback, or even just range it to death. If you're standing in the smoke trying to hit it and complaining about blind, then the problem exists between chair and keyboard.  
---
It's still too early in the fractal's life to judge the cannon mechanic harshly. When more people understand the mechanic it will fail less frequently. Which is how most mechanics in most new fractals go.  
---
I honestly never noticed the pirates had boons. I play a Druid in fractals, and I'm good enough that a few boons or instabilities don't phase me. The trash mobs have never felt difficult at all. The skeleton boss has pretty low HP and can be bursted down pretty quickly, but really it's just like fighting in Mai Trin with the cannons mechanic. Stay mobile and avoid orange circles--things that fractal players should be able to do. I think I've only ever wiped once on skele boss, the first time Siren's was on t4s. On lower tiers he is a laughable fight.  
---
Surprised you didn't bitch about the pocket raptors tbh.  
---
The pirate curse maze punishes greed. Try to grab too many treasures? You're greedy and get punished. Try to carry a treasure too long? Greedy. Wait until the last second to throw your treasure and get tagged by a detection circle? Greedy. It's not a difficult mechanic, and the animations are no longer than any other throwing mechanic in any other content (ie Trio hives/oils)

The final boss is pretty short and easy too. If you're having trouble with adds try bringing more cleave. The individual captains are only champions and pretty quick to kill. Had no issues with them on t4s this time. Mai Trin and Swampland are still harder fights to heal with the wrong instabilities.  
---
It really is a case of you need to get better. And the only way to get better is to play it more. If you quit now you'll never get better at it.  
---
till druid gets some buffs,we dont need any more of them,we need 0 atm XD
---
Depends what you want with them - for pure gold, check the wiki and compare sale-prices. Other than that it's mostly cosmetic/accountbound stuff.
---
Fake your LIs and dive into them. Try with easy raids: gorseval, mursaat overseer, samarog.
---
Read on dulfy the mechanics and try to reach 70% dps of your class. Thief dps is pretty Simple to Gear up and to use.
---
Now expect tons of People downvoting me because i Said to fake your li. Well, it's the same thing i personally did, and it worked Wonder. Finished legendary armor + collected li for a second legendary armor (for which i'm farming the materials).
---
You'll end up being good with raid. They are not so difficult: the more you complete them, the more they become repetetive and easy to complete. 
---
&gt; but people say chrono isnt good what should I do D:
---
Don't listen to ppl. Easy one.
---
As someone who's never touched raiding can someone help explain for me?
---
One guy with a baked potato for a brain is not a comprehensive representation of the raiding community.
---
^(Apologies to any baked potatoes I may have offended.)
---
I mean, once you have the mounts you have them. But I'm more impressed you came up with the mesmer solution to max gaming time with your friend, so good thinking. This is what makes MMOs the most fun
---
Yes! If you make a party, friends can join your personal story instance.
---
I think thats Arcane Blast? i dont really remember how that one was shortened into, ABlast or ABl?
---
1. ranger/necro
---
2. warrior/guardian/thief
---
3. engi/rev
---
4. mesmer
---
5. ele
---
It's out in alpha, which is the "it basically works but definitely isn't finished" stage. Give it a few weeks at the very, very least unless you want to be active in testing and submit crashlogs and bug reports. 
---
Personally, I've had crashes almost every time I've used it and decided to wait it out until the development is a little further along, probably until it hits beta or has another milestone release. 
---
The red infusion can drop as loot, so someone lucky could just get it on their first run. Some people don't accept it for that reason, fearing that one of those lucky guys might join.
---
Legendary armor on the other hand can't be dropped, it has to be crafted, so it should always be worth the LI that you put in.
---
I was agreeing with you and theorizing about what it means to alter story instances.
---
Nice. I noticed on the github that he just released a new version a few hours ago with a couple crash fixes. I'll probably install it tonight and see how it does on my hardware.
---
no, I mean when you already in an instance and then realise there is a big boss fight. can ppl then join?
---
Mesmer. The idea of a psychic warrior is super cool to me and the Mirage's dodge not moving you is also pretty nice.
---
Did you set up SMS like the game probably bugged you every day?
---
Cuz if you did, it should be super easy.
---
I wouldn't go with Revenant, since it's quite a different gameplay that requires more active mechanics. Guardian is a solid option, but necro is kind of king in solo PvE, though, if well played, any class can do pretty much anything. 
---
What difficulties are you running into? I changed my password once and cannot remember finding it difficult. Can you elaborate a bit?
---
Down to personal preference, but black lion salvage kits can save you a bit of gold if you want to recycle runes from exotic gear to put into ascended, for example. 
---
The two boosters are useful if you want to rush through a PvP track to get a reward. 
---
*Laughs but faster than everyone else*
---
I'm so sick of this in fractals. I'm not trying to do CM, I just want to get my T4 dailies done and so I use a scourge. If I start the group and welcome anyone with enough agony, we get it done. It takes maybe 2-3 mins more to do all T4s than when I'm in a meta group, but its done without pain or stress. Frankly that's worth the extra time.
---
Sorry, It wasn't very clear to me that you were agreeing with me.
---
Easiest classes (in my opinion) are going to be:
---
- Warrior.
---
- Ranger.
---
- Necromancer.
---
These classes are tanky, have lots of options for avoid damage, and generally can do a lot of damage.
---
Medium difficulty classes are going to be:
---
- Guardian.
---
- Revenant.
---
- Thief.
---
- Mesmer (sits between medium and hard difficulty, depends on the build really).
---
These classes take some time to get the hang of, need to focus more on active defense, and/or have extra buttons to press to complete a rotation.
---
Hard difficulty classes are going to be:
---
- Elementalist.
---
- Engineer.
---
These two classes are like playing a piano, but if you can get the hang of it down, they are easily the strongest classes in the game. Both have all the tools you'll need to tackle every situation, but take a lot of time and dedication to really get down. Engineer can be simplified if you go Holosmith, but it still requires lots of knowledge of fights.
---
I'd love a deep sea expansion too, but I do think that how enjoyable underwater combat is has a lot to do with which class you play.  Some classes are absolutely delightful underwater, and others... not so much.  
---
You mean when I bought the game 4 years ago? Nah I didn't set that up, did it even exist?
---
I do fractals and have done anything one can do in fractals, but you are right. That is just my experience. 
---
because unfortunately they STILL ask for the game key(and other info you probably forgot) for god knows what reason and by some twisted logic they are willing to reset your password but they won't give you the game key afterwards..makes sense right? to give access to the account but refuse to provide the game key? no? no..
---
i strongly suggest using sms or some other authenticator if you want to avoid contacting support in the future
---
The Personal Story is the "quest" system for GW2, emphasis on the quotes around quest. I'd say try it. It is short, simple, gives you rewards, and if you pay attention, you can learn about what is going on in the world. If it isn't your style, then simply ignore it, you will always be able to go back to it anytime in the game.
---
Are you on NA?
---
Having literally no camps outside of 2-3 is very rare on EU. Usually only occurs right after relinks when servers aren't balanced yet, and typically outside of primetime. 
---
I agree finding 250 kills can be difficult outside of primetimes. Getting shot by acs 250 times is probably a more reliable daily. 
---
I'm MC Zhaitan and I'm here today 
---
Thank you! :D
---
I want to know why they are so difficult. Nobody else requires this much bullshit. All they did was ensure I did not try GW2 again this weekend and now I will never try it again. Not the end of the world for them I guess but still, love to hear some logic behind their straight up stupid decision for password resets.
---
[$31.25 in gems, or 561 gold](https://i.imgur.com/OCgreMt.png) as of this posting. That is a lot.
---
For Fracs : Necro. Survivability and Still nice dmg and group support (Barriers)
---
For Raids: Any dps Class, cause dps is life and love
---
For open world: Ele, my one true Main. I really like the difference between all the elements, for one you can be supportive, deal a shit ton of dmg and you still are able to not get damage due to your Condis.
---
Close to the Heart vendor there are broken ventilation systems that you can put nearby gears into for decent progress. Problem is, that the gears respawn very slowly and there is usually only a few of them at a time. Some of the slow transformations you can also work around by gliding, which works at normal speed, but that again doesn't work on that heart since you have nowhere to start gliding.
---
If it is a weapon that your main character uses, keep it and just use a transmutation stone to make it look like something else. Legendary weapons can swap stats on the fly, as well as you can swap sigils without destroying them when needed. 
---
Otherwise, maybe find a use for it? I am assuming that it is account bound and you can't sell it.
---
It never said *when* he would be defeated. Just that he eventually would be.
---
The corpse was probably just to be seen in Arah explorable after the fact, but even that got cut. None of the Arah stories get anywhere near the nest of the dragon.
---
Eventually we only got his tail in the Priory's Special collections in Season 2 as proof that he was really dead. 
---
Anet is still trash. 
---
That won't happen because I can't reset my password and I'm not waiting for support to reply if I want to try GW2 on some random weekend. I'll go play a different game that doesn't require me to jump through 30 hoops after I already fucking paid them.
---
&gt; Thief
---
I actually think Thief is the easiest class to get to at least a mediocre level with.  Daredevil does ridiculous damage with autoattack alone, and also has access to blind and an endless number of dodges.  You almost never need to take damage.  Even the base thief has AOE blind with pistol, which makes PvE early on completely trivial.  It almost felt like I was cheating the whole time
---
when I map completed on my (basic) thief long ago, because nothing could hit me due to blind.  
---
I don't understand a word of this but I have yet to enter pvp
---
All I'm seeing is someone being irrationally mad at ArenaNet for their own mistakes.
---
You even made a throwaway to post this! 
---
&gt;Learn by error is the best and fastest way in everything
---
I agree with this part, and that's why numerous raid training discord channels were created, to provide new raiders with a toxicity-free environment for them to make mistakes and learn. There's literally *no good reason* for you to fake LIs and join experient groups (where you can hold them back), when you have that kind of tool at your disposal. 
---
You 33k ap people are the worst.  A large majority of you all are pve only people that farmed the stories and daily logins.  Just because you have a high ap doesnt mean jack. Got any kill proof? 
---
A) if you're selling unids instead of opening them in SW, you lose about 4 gph, dropping istan below 20.
---
B) you can use about 15 hours worth of bags and keys and currency in an hour. It's less efficient the less farming you do, because you're wasting time going to the maze with two keys or buying 10 bags from the vendors
---
&gt;they actually think you can't succeed without a meta group
---
Which is what the community has been nurturing since day 1. This is the inevitable result. Most guides on youtube and reddit start with "Full ascended and meta only" and only add on from there. 
---
dont forget to report for lfg abuse
---
And it doesn't say where either. 
---
For all we know chapter 5 could have happened in an alternate Tyria, and in chapter 6 we wake up from a vision Aurene was having and finally do it right in our Tyria.
---
even when you dont keep the "garbage" you write down every serial code for games you have.
---
there are 2 methods to start raiding in gw2
---
**a)the beta**
---
1)go to snowcrows.com, copy-paste the support build of your choice with gear and everything, read the guide if there is one and search youtube videos for the role including specific mechanics
---
2)on the same website you can find training discords, join them, share your api key and screenshots of inventory depending on how many LI/kp you have and as proof you have the proper gear including sigils and runes, do the captcha bot, donate your firstborn etc. to be accepted
---
3) politely wait for the chance to join and do your best!
---
**b)the Chad**
---
1)go to snowcrows.com and pick something with a big number on the benchmark list(not renegade)
---
2)go to golem and practice your rotation, aim for 85-90% of the benchmark number(84-89% if you don't have infusions)..you want to be at the top of the arc list, it's the only thing you should care for
---
3)install autohotkey, make a pinging script and make a notepad with chatcodes for: 250li, 249li, 80 dhuum tokens, 40 qadim tokens..dunno how to script? google it!
---
4) join a lfg of your choice, run the script, join the instance, type /gg to respawn since you have no idea where to go and follow the other dps players around, stay where they stay, move where they move etc.
---
5) sometimes you will see people writing "WTF ARE U DOING??", this is a secret code and you should type back "sry lag" to prevent kicking
---
whatever method you pick i wish you good luck in your adventures
---
Thanks, and I do see your point of Thief being easy in that sense. I love my 2 Thieves and highly recommend them to players who like that feeling of always attacking but never being hit. 
---
mesmer then thief
---
thief is my favorite to play and is my first character
---
mesmer is my favorite thematically, but i can't actually play one at all (other classes are great to play like warrior, guard, necro, revenant, but i can't really get into the mesmer gameplay despite how useful they are in group content) 
---
Looks more like a pic pre-release of BoA and then a couple months post-release of BoA tbh
---
yes it is
---
Good. [Fuck Godnaz and his shitty attempts to try and hide his comments.](https://i.imgur.com/Fh76dAB.png)
---
Oh fuck off troll.
---
I really like Overload Air.
---
No. People can only join after the start in dungeons, fractals and raids. 
---
For story instances and other instances that work like them such as the Home Instance and some festival event instances, people need to join from the start.
---
You usually know everyone has to be there to join because there's a timer with a progress bar emptying and everyone has to accept the panel to enter. 
---
Will anyone banned for months even bother with this game anymore?
---
I sure wouldn't.
---
Thank you!
---
all you need to know is that anyone who asks for 250li in LFG is just looking to troll 9 other players
---
I just say look at my title, which is Voice in the Void and I'm generally accepted into any group. 
---
Whenever I command a clear run, I just ask people to link me anything, I'm happy for someone to say "Yeah I'm new, but I do X damage on the Golem and have read the fights". If they mess up a mechanic it's usually not the end of the world and they have the chance to learn with more experienced players and get some advice. If it's consistent poor play then I politely tell them they need learn the fight with people willing to teach them for longer periods of time. 
---
OP literally only just started the game and they're getting an inbox notification for that top level reply.
---
There's a chance they already know about it from social media or from Path of Fire advertisement but still that's just inconsiderate.
---
The wooden floors don't look half bad...
---
Can you give me the serial code for a game you purchased in 1998? I don't even remember when I bought the damn thing. 
---
I knew this would happen the moment a use for LI was released.
---
BfA*
---
&gt;clicking on this thread thinking Livia's VA sung the full song
---
&gt;it's just a recording of her clips from in-game
---
sadface
---
(I don't actually follow WoW so thank you)
---
Yeah, for sure. But he used to play on a pretty old computer and was always lagging like crazy, so I was already playing as mesmer every time we played together to help him get to places that are hard to reach when you play on a potato, haha. 
---
I can confirm I got this email aswell and was banned in april aswell. 
---
They just moved the main hub around, it's no longer Ironforge. GW1 did it too - Kaineng is dead compared to Kamadan.
---
GW2 is unique in a sense that it doesn't introduce new major hubs with expansions.
---
I always try to read the first 2 panels. but 100% of the time I just give up and don't bother. 
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Diablo is ;))
---
Hey, I'm not the one who dislikes the way someone else plays the game, affecting me in no way.
---
For lots of players, Fashion Wars = endgame. I'm all about someone being as casual as they like, as long as they're having fun.
---
Look if you fucking idiots think this is my fault then you're part of the problem. The password reset is needlessly complex in asking for a bunch of worthless fucking information. I have my email, it is my email, it is all I fucking need to reset my password to EVERYTHING ELSE I FUCKING OWN. I hope you all enjoy being smug cocksuckers because you play a subpar piece of shit MMO. Fuck. Off.
---
&gt; One guy on discord was calmly explaining all the mechanics
---
That's nice of him.
---
&gt;and after about 8 tries we defeated her. 
---
great!
---
&gt;I was Daredevil DPS hitting around 16K.
---
So you got carried.
---
&gt;This was my first ever raid experience and turns out Xera is one of the harder bosses apperently?
---
I would say so, yes.
---
&gt;I thought that shit was easy peasy
---
For a dps class xera is pretty easy, the hard part has the mesmer (and bad pc and/or bad internet makes the "puzzles" or splits whatever you want to call them pretty tough and it doesn't even have to be you. If 1-2 other people die it could mean wipe.)
---
&gt;I’ve been waiting so long to finally do it as it turns out it’s not that hard with the right people
---
Because finding the right people takes actually forever, especially if you dont have kp or li.
---
&gt;Why people have these high 500LI requirements for such easy content
---
To make it smooth. Everyone can drive through a racetrack, yet you would rather take someone who did it 500 times already.
---
&gt;People should just add common sense and a pair of ears as a requirement in the LFG tool.
---
Yea, I actually agree with that. But people are so entitled about how good they are that they don't even listen to explanations.
---
Hi, IhateYouSHutUp!
---
I am am just dropping by to wish you a lovely day! Take care!

I saw a cool theory that if Kralkatorrik has future sight, he might have realized Glint's betrayal and her role in his downfall, if that truly is to come. He could have lied to her, to make sure her plans go in the wrong direction and fail.
---
And yet not-so-unique in that everyone still huddles around DR anyways
---
[&amp;Auz2LQEA]
---
There you go, congratulations. You are now an experienced raider for LFG groups.
---
That's just what they missed because of the ban, it's the least they have to give these people.
---
I can respect that
---
Ironically, Diablo Immortal was dead on arrival. Zing!
---
As for the GW games, they always say they the game will be up for as long as there's people playing. Even if "people" is singular. 
---
Kamadan still have lots of people. And GW's server structures run on very little resources and take less resources the less players are online. So they probably can afford to keep the game up even for 1 person. Even if one they can't even do that, they can probably release the server so people can put it up in their own computer.
---
Well, i guess it's better than never. Their apologies look kinda solid too. If only they improved their detection system instead of banning people and taking a whole year to investigate the problem. 
---
well... yeah. I thought it's obvious.
---
Mesmers just wanna have fun!
---
Imagine the possibilities? You + 3 clones of your favorite people ever.
---
Just got the email as well. Although that would never erase the prejudgement you get for telling all your in-game friends and guild mates that you were gone for 6 months because you were suspended, it's still nice that they (eventually) dived deeper on this and took some affirmative action on it. However, there will always be a bitter feeling for me that they chose to execute and handled the suspension cases without any remorse.
---
Side note, but I think the message was a little sloppy as the "your ###### account" wasn't even the correct one... I spoke to another person who also got the same message but with the wrong account ID in the email body.
---
make a game mode where you can pose all the minis you have like action figures and take screenshots with em.  that'd breathe life into minis (and possibly make naked kas even more expensive huehuehuehue)
---
I recommend reading through the rest of the posts. He stopped playing ("took a break") because the effort to get new shinies was overwhelming for him. Which is completely fine
---
I mostly play with the goal of getting the next cosmetic, and I've bought several new character slots time and time again simply because I had a new aesthetic in mind. So I completely get that.
---
He would juggle hairstyles, and that's fine, but he'd also stop me time and time again to ask how his hair looked. And as others have pointed out, there are better titles for that if you aren't even willing to put a tiny bit of effort into getting new shinies. He was easily overwhelmed, which is completely fine, I wasn't attacking him over it, but it was a relief (for me) that he decided to take a break because I couldn't take "hey stop for a sec, does this blue look better than this blue?" when he inevitably changed the same character's hair for the tenth time in a single play session
---
I hope they will, themselves, go out publicly and apologize.
---
We were right all these months, they were wrong. 
---
I was one of the banned players. 
---
just making sure
---
Only in GW2 is anything more interesting than press 1 on the boss and kill a couple mobs now and than considered "mechanically intense and challenging."
---
This is the peak of utter BS. That is just an idiot trying to get carried
---
I've gone through this a number of times as I got close to milestones, and what helped was identifying what game areas had untapped pools of AP. The GW2 efficiency site can help with this, once you give it your API key.
---
http://gw2efficiency.com/
---
For example. PVP was an area that I had underplayed. Right now, we are in the middle of a PVP season, so achievements under Year of the Ascension 1~4 are all active when you play season matches. This means that playing a match now progresses many achievements. Off the top of my head, a single win in a match simultaneously progresses these achievements:
---
* PVP wins
---
* PVP ranked wins
---
* PVP class-specific wins
---
* PVP ranked class-specific wins
---
* Year of the Ascension wins
---
* Year of the Ascension class-specific wins
---
* (Year of the Ascension wins/day)
---
* Map-specific wins
---
Of course, I don't know what you have already done; this is just about how to find some more AP.
---
...I mean, I totally *get it* but it was just **really** surprising to suddenly walk in on, especially because I only saw a naked Lord Faren standing there, staring back at me, for several seconds before the clone dissolved and the Mesmer-chick started yelling/attacking me.
---
Like...if I walked into a room I thought was empty at a party but it was "occupied" sort of thing. It's not expected, hence the shock value
---
80% kinda sucks but I can make do for now, thanks.
---
Prophecies don't have to become true. They only show possible futures. Aurene saw many battles with Kralkatorrik in which she died, but only one ever happened. The same goes for the future Kralkatorrik saw: it does not need to become reality. If he didn't lie to Glint about that vision.
---
sadly gw2 already did something like this, by adding those special areas, such as like lily of elon and all the others. I wish they would just erase them from the game :(
---
Well people still play GW1 if that's any indicator :P
---
Do they think any of those people after getting their accounts accounts banned for 9 months and not being able to play for that period will come back just because they were given some gems and the episodes they missed unlocking for free?
---
If this had happened within a month of the bans, then I would say good move by Anet, not 9 months later though.
---
mate, I still have all the game boxes from the games I bought in the 90s.
---
Its the old story of the meta is only better than others if they're actually skilled at it. Surprise surprise, most aren't.
---
Yeah... I had to send out a ticket before the suspension was lifted because I knew I was going to miss out on the episode when I returned. Even then, I got hit with this reply:
---
&gt;After researching your account, I apologize, but we will not be able to offer access to Living World Season 4, Episode 3: Long Live the Lich. Unfortunately, when an episode is missed, regardless of the reason, we are unable to offer access to the episode. At this point, the episode can be obtained for 200 Gems in-game. I again sincerely apologize for the inconvenience as well as the inability to offer further assistance.
---
You can forge them and get back a random exotic that you can sell or do w/e with.
---
I dont know if it counts as a bug ( or its just me ), but since i got the choya wood gathering tool, it only gives me 2 logs instead of 3. so i have to interact a second time with the tree to get a 3rd one. 
---
Hello left field. Welcome to the game. 0.o
---
easiest are the JP and explorer achies for 10 AP each. but I assume you already have them?
---
i don't know, i reset my alt account password 3 times and every time i was not provided with the game key and god knows what credit card number i used back then etc.
---
just do the sms thing, it's really not hard and it shouldn't be a reason to play or not play this game..it's extremely petty to get hung up on details such as these but your choice i guess
---
&gt; During that review, we discovered that **a very small number** of accounts were suspended in error,
---
I wonder *how* small, percentage-wise, that number actually was. I would imagine that the amount of gamers who had installed both cheat-powered software and GW2 at the same time without cheating in an MMO wouldn't be *that* small.
---
I have a feeling this one would.
---
It feels great on maps with verticality but on vanilla maps there's not much you can do to get height to stay in the air.
---
imo I don't see anything wrong with a mount that can literally fly and maintain altitude. Let me coast along and watch everything pass by underneath me. ;~;
---
Yes
---
I mean, the mechanical failure of the Zhaitan fight ruins it entirely. You spend 5-10 min hammering the 1 key. And take into account the jolly ride in-between the actual boss of the dungeon (the big mouth boss), where you just wait for some dickhead dragons to come up, then wait for them to be shootable at, then wait again.
---
It's not that the buildup to Zhaitan was bad, it's that the Zhaitan fight is SO bad it actually makes the buildup feel even worse. All this hype for...This?
---
Send another ticket, apparently the tech is there now after all
---
250 LI is basically training raid tier.
---
1000 LI or bust.
---
Mordremoth was a bit more than that.
---
Oh good old Ironforge, pvp duels at the gate where warlocks are not allowed to 1v1 anyone.
---
I mean they simply moved the main hub as someone said. When i was playing there was usually 1 new main city with each expansion and the crowd moved there sometimes 1 for both factions sometimes 1 for each.
---
I highly doubt gw2 will even survive 10 more years more than how gw1 is right now. Mainly because i think it'll be seriously outdated and there will be a new Anet game at that point, whether it is gw3 or something else.
---
Even this close to classic release, the bigger private realms have their Ironforge and Orgrimmar just as packed.

They're like polar opposites of what they promised back in 2011-2012 when showing off the main hubs and their design choices. Money --&gt; everything.

I mean, and also the whole "hey some other dragons are using Death energy stuff, wonder why that would be"

I'm on Power Firebrand and played Chrono before. I won't burst without the important boons or a fast break that is for sure. Sometimes I just heal fb with 4 dudes on random classes which have lower bursts than me on power fb... What I can tell for sure is that people tend to panic in longer fights even without any reason. 
---
The only thing I recommend is a source of protection, offensiv boons, buffs and burst dps. 
---
Most of the time people just lack boons. Of course they need healing if they eat hits without aegis or protection. Defensiv boons are much healthier in a pve enviorment than healing at a dps loss.
---
Healing and defensiv boons is just overkill from my point of view. I mean we have pots and potions for damage mitigation and thats more than enough with protection. 
---
Good bot.
---
GW2 has no bugs, only features. 
---
My favorites are ones where you are helping people in non-combat ways, like the matchmaker one, the ones where you help refugees, etc. 
---
Least fav are bundle ones and transform ones zzz
---
Thing is, the software never existed on my computer.  Their detection was flawed.  I barely have enough time to game at all.  I certainly don't have time to muck about with cheat software.

You do not own your gw2 account. You only rent it from anet.
---
I’ve always had the same feeling about the genre as a whole. I’ve really been wanting to get back into it though which is why I asked. I guess we will just see
---
I neither paid the difference nor progressed further into the story since. However, I think I did catch the small window when they temporarily released free access to one of my missing episodes in the trading Black Lion Trading Company. Either way, the email implies any missing episodes will be reinstated into the account.
---
Nonetheless, that doesn't really justify the lack of remorse to those unjustly affected even if I tell myself that I can understand that they are in a difficult situation of discerning the right from the wronged.
---
It really isn't. You can check raid stats for WoW to see the effect that variable difficulties had (first when introduced with Obsidian Sanctum and then Ulduar and then later with Looking for Raid at the end of Cataclysm).
---
The fact that Anet is so actively against variable difficulties is utterly dumbfounding considering it is one of the most successful aspects of Fractals and encourages people to improve to teach the highest tier. 
---
Ranger, I've always like the archer/ranger feel.  I played my ranger for 1.5 years before making my first alt.
---
Considering crafting Verdarach and was excited to check out the musical novelty aspect of it but I honestly cannot find any video examples of it online. I have also been trying for a couple days to find someone who owns it in LA or divinitys reach. 
---
Could anyone upload an example of the musical verdarach sounds or songs? 
---
&gt; They wrongfully ostracized and literally scammed people of their service access they paid for.
---
Wrongfully "ostracized," sure. But that doesn't change the fact that they have a responsibility to protect the integrity of the game and economy - and that comes with the unfortunate necessity of banning accounts when something seems amiss. Considering the Terms of Service literally mention their right to terminate access without warning (and users acknowledgement of said ToS) there is nothing about this that is a scam.
---
I'm not happy to see them making a mistake either, glad as I might be that they are trying to make right, and as I wasn't affected by the bans myself I get I have some bias. I don't expect the people to come back and happily start playing now that they admit wrong, but it's good to see an apology coming at all - they could have just kept silent and not done this, as most people have moved on from this incident, and I doubt most people who are still playing would bat an eye. 
---
And yet, they are admitting fault, no doubt knowing full well just how upset this could make the community. I think that shows, at the very least, that their intentions were good, and as such I can't fault them for making an apology like this.
---
recently got transfered to work the 2nd shift, so i can only play during the morning hours on est time, the lfg is pretty dead when i am free, im thinking of transfering over to eu server for more active lfg, anyone know when the european servers are most active during EST hours?
---
\^ This for me as well. Of course, in the original reddit post, many were skeptical due to the accusations but this very email also does justify the flawed detection means.
---
noob question, what is d912dxy?
---
Monthly is mixed with daily AP, so technically you didn't miss out on anything there.
---
The skilled, nontoxic players spend more time actually doing the fractals than trying to filter out their LFGs. As a result, in my experience they also finish faster and are much less prone to "we wiped on one boss so i'm going to leave the party immediately."
---
They did brag about the banwave also spreading fake claims how carefull their investigation was and that they do not accept appeals. IF they have the balls to pretend they make no mistake, they should have balls to publicly apologize when it turns out they failed. 
---
Put chemicals in the water to turn the freaking frogs gay
---
Thats not enough. The damage was done.  In game currency has zero real world value.  I had 10k gold at the time 
---
Banned for a gear checker was bullshit.   Unless you were going through walls in pvp  what fucking advantages are they blabbering about.   There was no currency value ... completing a junping pizzle with assistive programs so fucking what... just chose a different program. That taco program would have done the same shit...  i was a commander. I did so many events and content .. squads were always fulll... and then  now ... fuck it.   People are miserable and i would spark some fires in map chat give some energy and life to this devoid mmo.    Not enough...  i would teach people raids almost every other day, i constantly farmed dungeons. I introduced people and carried them through their first fractals. 
---
Tell anet to keep their empty maps.  Banning 1500 people for pve content and qol programs without any warning.   Just went straight to bann. Tried to petition many times.    This upsets me more than just leaving us banned. 
---
Yeah, and it was an actual boss, rather than a quick time event with no timers.
---
So... why didn’t you just upload that image itself?
---
actually with last year's ban wave where most of the affected accounts where innocent people and real "hackers" remained untouched I wouldn't be surprised
---
Fuck you
---
Well, the team DOES know, however, we are limited in what we can see on a user's account. Case in point: We cannot see your Masteries, nor what is unlocked and so on. :\ 
---
I checked to find any ticket where we told a user they "just lost" mastery points and was unable to find it. If a ticket number is present for that, /u/Taidakun - I'd be highly interested to see the ticket - because that answer would be bluntly wrong. If you can provide the ticket number to me, I'd be very glad to check into this.
---
Often, especially if a ticket is kind of vague, the team has to guess what the issue may be and run with it. The other option would be to repeatedly ask for more details, which the team was asked to stop doing after we got the feedback that we were spamming customers and not trying to help. 
---
It's a bit of "damned if you do, damned if you don't" for us.
---
Yeah I don't expect the healer to be able to solo an illusion on their own, just saying that I can burst down a second illusion when needed :)
---
the last mastery + the second crystal mastery can get you very high in the air. Then the dive mastery let you go even higher with momentum, regardless of maps
---
EST is 6 hours behind central Europe, so 06:00-12:00 for you is 12:00-18:00 for us, give or take an hour. 
---
Too early for Europe to come home from school/work, although the later hours should definitely be crowded enough. No clue about the state of LFG in those hours though. 
---
to impale the dragos of light and hope
---
Fair enough. I stand corrected. 
---
May I ask how much play time you have overall? I'm having kind of a hard time how casual you gotta be for 250g to be a grind after 6 years of playing when just doing the daily achievements gives 2g in like 10 minutes.
---
Around late morning - early afternoon.
---
The game mode is already dead so your point is moot
---
I meant you took a picture with your phone of a picture you already had on your computer.
---
So they unbanned in October but didn't bother telling anyone until now? That seems a bit odd.
---
9 months eh...
---
&gt;2,500 gems to your account
---
If it was 6 month ban.. That would only piss me off. 
---
Actually I can, and I stand by it. The griffon is objectively not a grind by the strictest of definitions
---
...except the Behemoth itself, which honestly takes a tad bit longer than doing the heart itself. But I see your point
---
I was just curious why, since you said it was in a gallery.  Unless you mean it was in your phone gallery back then.  I was making an assumption that the image was a picture of a print screen.  Probably a poor assumption.
---
lmao are you even listening to yourself? Using the word 'objectively' and then putting qualifiers on that objectivity in the same exact sentence. The lack of self-awareness is staggering - as is your shitty, judgemental attitude towards someone who obviously plays the game a lot less than you do.
---
It does piss me off.  However, I am currently high on screaming  "I WAS RIGHT!"
---
Thanks for the reply, fam. I saw a video on it and it looks cool. Will give it a try now  :)
---
- Old LA  
---
- New LA
---
If not for my raiding guild I would never raid. I'm able to meet benchmarks and do all the mechanics but I don't have the desire to clear raids every week and collect all the kill proofs that some of the PUG raids want. I guess it's all about finding the right people to play with. 
---
Thanks a lot for the breakdown. I'm not entirely new to the genre, so I think Guardian and Necromancer will be who I'll be trying out now! :)
---
I guess the only thing is that if you want to get into the actual hard content, you have to use party finder anyway. Well, there are usually about a hundred party finder groups during the prime time anyway so it's all ok.
---
What are you on about? It's so easy to make gold in this game without buying gems. Anyone who does that is a sucker
---
And here I always thought line-weight was just done by people having super duper uber awesome tablets - instead of a crappy cheap one lik me - with hypersensitive touch so that they can smoothly switch thickness on a dime! :O
---
I was curious as well, and found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X7DoJfSv3k) video when searching around myself.
---
The horn kinda gets lost in the bass and Minstrel harp, but it is what it is. I may ask them next time I see one of them, see if they're willing to throw like a 1-min showcase on youtube.
---
exactly, people with more than 20k ap just means they spend more time farming ap than actually doing fractals.
---
Are you me? This was my exact reaction Saturday night 
---
Is it, though? That doesn't seem like much for nearly a year of being unjustly banned.
---
When raids have been out for years, it's quite easy to rack up enough LI's. Unfortunately, LI is not really a precursor to skill and ability, just how many times you've been able to kill a boss. For example, someone could have 250 LI now and they could have literally only killed the first 2 bosses of Wing 1 since raids came out. 
---
i dont think the game is dead lmao i should have put a /s
---
If you are in a guild that does the guild missions, you can at least get the berserker or assasins rings and trinkets from the token vender.
---
Lol makes all those downvotes worth it, at least i can finally start buying gems and supporting ANET again.
---
Yeah, you used an example that has nothing to do with GW. 
---
It's like usinge a Lich from WoW as an example for a GW Lich and talking about their Vessel (there is no Vessel in GW).
---
However, as far as we know from the past prophecies in GW/GW2 *can't* be rewritten.
---
PS. Yes, I read your comment, but maybe *you* should read mine too...
---
Elitism generally comes from LFG's around raid reset early in the week as people want their clears. However there's quite often training raids where people don't really care too much about what you're running later on in the week. Unfortunately the best training groups tend to be "locked" behind training discords and individual guilds who don't post on the LFG. If you have any inkling or interest in raids I highly suggest you seek them out as they cater to people want to experience raids without the elitism. 
---
Sounds more like he's refusing to play meta builds or something like that. Meta comps can easily burn through the encounters without too much worries.
---
Deaxxons trainings are great
---
Exception at comment 4, line 1.
---
Unsolvable logic error. 
---
reddit niggas still gonna say youre lying as there's no way anet could ban you incorrectly
---
Shouldn't you be practicing new raid strategies or doing challenges with idk, a guild? From my perspective in any mmo LFGs are for learning the rope. The challenging your group thing is more for a guild run. But I'm a outsider I've only done raids in WoW. I've avoided guild wars 2 raid community because how toxic and elitist it seems.
---
This image I uploaded was a photo of the game I took with my phone, I found it in my phone gallery (I've got a Samsung, that's what the photo storage is called) lmao
---
Congratulations! It's good to see ANet finally apologise for a mistake.   I made this reddit account back during early release because my account was banned on the second day, I never received an explanation from support why and my account was locked for the entire early start. I had taken leave to spend this time playing with friends &amp; family. I reached out to support on twitter and reddit to get attention for this and all I got was an acknowledgement that they don't know why I was banned.  I hope they continue with this mentality going forward!
---
Wait I'm a bit confused, so was the ban happened in April and then the unban happened in just recently or October? Jeez I'd be a bit pissed if I was banned unjustly for 6+ months and was just compensated with 2500 gems. I would have found a new mmo by then
---
I didn't take a picture of the picture on my computer, that would make no sense lmao
---
seeing that people wipe infront of dulfy and still can't do the start of the dredge fractal or oneburn the last boss there...i dunno.  
---
i would rate cairn, mo, samarog way way way easier. hell, even sabetha is just another dps golem even tho people find it hard for whatever reason.
---
There's basically no way to tell you without knowing what you've already got done or what you actually are good at/enjoy doing.
---
Honestly, achievement hunting is cool but you should explore it at your own reasonable pace. The panel is there for you to explore and has everything but a few hidden achievements (which typically have tiny AP rewards), and historical achievements like living world season 1 (which is a ton of AP, but unfortunately no longer available to any of us). 
---
Yeah can I get banned for the gems too? Haha,  no seriously how do I earn gold for gems ;-;
---
Returnjng player here, I wanna buy the old living world stories :(
---
We went through this at the time, Cheat Engine has legitimate uses despite its name, plus just because one has it running for use on single player games does not mean they are cheating in mmos.
---
Well that's annoying. I was banned right at the start of the wave, served my 2000 hours, and got access back. And now they're doing this, after I'm already unbanned. RNGesus has forsaken me IRL too i guess.
---
I got banned in the first year gw2 came out for purchasing something with the transaction needing authorisation but I got straight up banned. Haven’t played since after wasting around £100 on the game. That’s one way to get a first time mmo player to never touch the genre again! 
---
I didn't knew there were still people who didn't have the griffon, such an amazing world that's gw2.
---
you get a 6 month ban ...wrongfully.....and after 8(!!!) months Anet gets the idea to take a closer look at it?!!??
---
Seriously... they are fucking with you :-(
---
They also have a responsibility to investigate matter in a timely manner, something they did not do.
---
100 CM is cool,99 CM is ok,others are trash 
---
And all the fanboys are upvoting him.
---
The hardest part about the Griffin quest is finding a group for Legendary Corrupted Facet.  It took me months to get my Griffin largely because Legendary Corrupted Facet is a “hurry up and wait” type of situation. 
---
For those that don’t know, the boss only spawns about once per hour.  When the boss has spawned, you only have 10 minutes to beat him.  Whenever I would log into the game, either the boss would be on cool down or there wouldn’t there wouldn’t be enough people who want to join the group.  In the rare circumstance where the boss has spawned and there is enough people to join the group, some random player activates the 10 minute timer before the group is ready to fight.  
---
It would have been a lot easier to beat Legendary Corrupted Facet had the boss not been on such a strict timer.  Personally I think Bounty bosses linked to collection quests should be on more relaxed timers.  
---
As a side note, I wish the developers would bring back the Istan Mount License and the Grand Lion skin.  I feel like buying a new skin for my griffin but the current selection of skins just doesn’t appeal to me at the moment.  
---
Here is my secret as an achievement Hunter:
---
https://gw2efficiency.com/account/unlock-statistics?filter.show=locked
---
This will show all achievements that are currently obtainable that you have not finished. (Requires you to give gw2efficiency an API key, which you really should do)
---
Then you can sort by how many other users have finished that achievement. This is akin to sorting by difficulty really. The more people have completed that achievement, the easier it tends to be.
---
Fortunately you fucking off and playing another game, at least from your responses here, is probably a akin to a serving suggestion. I'm sure most of us aren't losing sleep over it. 
---
I get that you're frustrated. But don't take it out on us.
---
Thief here. Just couldnt find fun in other professions as i did with thief. In pve, well, its simple and easy, but in pvp....thats where the fun lies. 
---
You have so many choices and playstyles youll never get bored. From full invis deadeye gank n runner, to semi stealth dagger pistol ganker. Then you have sword dagger build where youll be all around the place,confusing people, able to travel over 1500 feet in split second etc.
---
The thing is, its really hard to learn in pvp. In the beggining youll get smashed and humiliated all the time. But the joy of seeing yourself advance and get better, its what makes  it really fun. 
---
Amen.
---
This stuff is why I don't trust the whole "GM stepping in to RIGHTFULLY TELL OFF THE CHEATER ON THE FORUMS" narrative that occasionally crops up.
---
This is why no one wants to get into raiding 😂
---
isnt that just the ponytail hairstyle with that one gemstore item?  whats "new" about it? @\_\_@
---
Definitely, I still don't know how I pulled it off all in a day. What I did, was I camped the bounty board and as soon as the bounty came up I started advertise for group - but didn't trigger it until I formed a squad of 10. I sent everyone at the pyramid and made them wait there until we were all ready, then pulled the bounty from board :D
---
Wish I had been banned lol
---
You sir, are the reason why i didnt completely turned away from raids. 
---
As a 87LI with all bosses (exept w6) cleared, I thank you and your "efforts" for the better of the community. 
---
Istan is probably the fastest if you have the Karma upgrade and have a class that can tag everything.  But Season 3/4 dailies also give Karma, and some of them literally take seconds. Like Bloodstone Fen just jump of the airship, collect 10 purple floaty balls while spamming glider skills.
---
However that person also doesn't realize that he generalizes a group of people, while at the same time generalizing his own opinion, making it sound like everyone looking for meta groups "just wants to be efficient". And I've known from personal experience that this is not the case, I've had instances in both the game and on this reddit where people think "meta" / optimal setup is the only way to beat a fractal/raid. One guy here tried to argue with me that "no updrafts is actually the way the encounter is meant to be played", as if the devs put updrafts all around the boss platform with destroyable walls just for the luls.
---
As long as you're not escorting someone to get a heart progress eheh 
---
Professional would be them apologizing within the month, not almost a year later... In the time it took them to apologize, I'd forgotten they'd went out and mass-banned a bunch of people cause some of them were cheaters... I wouldn't call that professional. Granted, it is infinitely more professional then banning a bunch of innocent players, then never bringing it back up, leaving them all banned.
---
Claypool - it's an infamous one indeed

Cleary was removed from security immediately following that banwave. I'm assuming it took them several months to replace him, and, for some reason, nobody else was capable of looking into it until they did.
---
The ban ended after 6 months, in October.
---
except training gets full fast, by faking you get into a group instantly.
---
Neither did the flair...
---
Fuck, man. You make me want to quit. And I'm a fairly new player. 
---
and yet you still follow a GW2 sub... This game must still have a hold on your sub-conscious to have you continue to read the sub but not played in years... :)
---
The corpse was to be at Zhaitan's Rest, given the name. It was indeed sadly removed though, replaced by giant coral.
---
OK I didn't know Cleary had been moved, is he still with anet?
---
So basically what you're saying is that people make mistakes and it's OK to act like a manchild about it? 
---
Got it.
---
Happened to me and I was a partner. 10/10 quality customer support.
---
Can someone tell why do people redact the names of idiots like this? I would like to know and block him...
---
In the scope of multiplayer gaming, you should. This took so long *because* the overwhelming majority of bans were justified.
---
In some games, League of Legends comes specifically to mind but I’ve seen it elsewhere, the devs’ community staff would show up and post some examples of the offending material (usually chat logs) and it just never failed.
---
&gt; I was banned for 30 days for abusive language, but I’m the nicest angel ever
---
&gt;&gt; Here are some excerpts from four different matches in which you used a volatile racial slur and two in which you told low-ranked teammates to kill themselves
---
&gt;&gt;&gt; Rekt
---
And they didn't even want to verify those cases back then, we just got bot like responses when we submitted a support ticket.
---
At that time I asked what program I was accused to be cheating with since I use Wine to play on Linux and the Windows software I can run is kinda... limited. They told me that they had revised their data, that the decision was final and yada yada I don't even want to remember... Now I got an apology almost a year later.
---
Why didn't they just **actually** check their logs back then?
---
I personally don't recommend GW2 to anyone. Haven't done it for almost a year and I don't think that will change soon.
---
They say that they "*discovered that* ***a very small number*** *of accounts were suspended in error*" Well I would like a public list of all those accounts in the forums with the apology. I don't really care about the gems or the episodes.
---
Nowadays there are good alternatives for stacking boons, the primary thing you're losing out on is spirits
---
&gt; Nonetheless, that doesn't really justify the lack of remorse
---
The email in the OP is quite apologetic, and it offers more than 50% of the game’s retail price in MTX currency for a 9-month ban.
---
It absolutely blows that this happened to you in the first place, but I’m not sure what more you could expect after the fact.
---
That is exactly how language works. One of the ways new words come into common use is through the mangling of existing words. Once enough people use them wrong for long enough, that becomes the new "correct" word.
---
My favorite example is ampersand, "&amp;", which was originally "per se and", and was placed at the end of the alphabet. When children would say "and per se and" at the end (similar to the current "and z"), they would mush it together. Eventually, this obvious mistake became the "correct" word for the symbol.
---
English is not a dead language. It changes as we speak and type it. 
---
May I then ask, what made you continue to stay on after these 9 long months? If it were me I’d have stormed off and quit the game “forever” etc. 
---
Dinky is bae
---
Sound advice, ill wait another 10-15 to see if it gets better. Ran with guys who were full legendary armor leaving level 50s (not me) behind expecting them to run through mobs. Like communicating to a door.
---
It was 6 months, the worst part of this all is the fact that people who were affected by this were already unbanned.
---
Wanting to get a guild hall mainly for extra storage. Only have 2 active people in the guild. Any tips on how to get favor? Or is it just a pipe dream?
---
'Cause A-Nets mistake caused the death of countless children across the world.
---
Ele , Holo
---
&gt;unwarranted 
---
Id hardly call it unwarranted, cheaters were running rampant  and something needed to be done about it. the anti cheat method they used is widely used by many companies, very similar to battle eye and steam VAC. Also if you use Cheat Engine then you know that MOST anti cheat systems will flag it.   
---
Id say they could have handled it better tho. Collect the data, investigate the flagged accounts and THEN ban; rather than take longer than the suspension period to fully investigate the cases. 
---
Right? I've been playing off and on since release and only have around 5k AP. I also don't sit around all day for years grinding out arbitrary achievements that have no effect on my ability to complete certain encounters.
---
Exactly. It costs them nothing to hand out the LS episodes and gems. Literally nothing. There's no monetary compensation for being wrongly kicked out of the game for 6 months.
---
I think I'll log back in but I am certainly never spending a cent again, because if the security guy that gloated so gleefully on Twitter about these bans is still working there, I expect this BS to happen again, also with zero appeals process expect to be treated like crap still.
---
Was ANet always this bad? I came in at the launch of GW2 so never experienced them with GW1, but it seems like they just can't do anything right without shooting themselves in the foot several times and saying they didn't shoot themselves in the foot.
---
Are you okay?
---
In terms of how important each piece is, the importance should go in this order: Weapon &gt; Trinkets &gt; Armor. Within trinkets, prioritize amulet &gt; rings &gt; accessories &gt; backpack. Within armor, it should be chest &gt; shoulders &gt; helmet &gt; everything else. Also cool note, diviners is available as a stat on HOT stat selectable items, even though it is not a HoT stat. TL;DR: Specialization collections and crafting for weapons. Raids for armor. Tyria trinkets: fractals for backpack and rings, guild missions or living world for accessories, laurels for trinkets. Everything else: check if your stat is available on HoT stat selectable trinkets, then spam Living World Season 3 maps (episode 3: a crack in the ice is your best friend)
---
Ascended Weapon: The best way to get these is typically via the specialization collections. There's a cheap way to make at least one of the Path of Fire ones. Some come with useful stats, but some do not (none of the renegade collections come with useful stats), but you can always mystic toilet them to the right stats. This method typically requires 400 weaponsmithing, so you should at least get to there. Crafting ascended weapons is not excessively expensive either, but could be annoying when you need 3 different kinds of weapons, that may come from different professions. For crafting ascended weapons, always craft plain ascended weapons and convert them into HOT stats or POF stats, as it's much cheaper this way (same for armor).
---
Ascended Amulet: The best way to get tyria stats is to just spend Laurels. It's only 35, which means you'd have this in just 30 days of play if you don't spend it on anything else. Don't buy any other ascended pieces with laurels. You can get several ascended amulets doing achivement hunting in the story missions for both HoT and PoF for free, and it can be quite fun. Finally, check Living World Season 3 maps. I prefer Episode episode 6 as the way to get amulets.
---
Ascended Ring: Fractals are by far the best way to get tyria stats, as you only need to do 10 dailys to get each ring. If you have fractals leveled all the way to T4, you get around 15 a day if you do all the dailys, just to show how fast you can get these rings. If you need HoT stats (vipers, diviners), run living world season 3 maps, especially episode 3.
---
Ascended Accessory: Guild missions are a nice cheap way of getting tyria stat accessories. however, not every guild can get you these quickly as they may not have the levels unlocked to get many missions per week. Otherwise, your best bet is Living World Season 3 maps. You should get accessories in Episode 3 (black ice earing) and Episode 2 (sparkling petrified wood). There are some accessories you can get from Living World Season 4 although they may take longer.
---
Ascended Backpack: Fractals is probably one of the cheapest ways to get an ascended backpack, but the stats are limited to basically Berserker as the only useful stat. This typically helps you towards the legendary backpack achievement, so might as well do the work once. Otherwise, you'd want to farm Living World maps for map currency. You can get pretty neat unique skins that way too! If you can't get your stat, you can get backpacks of any stat through raids, albeit a bit pricy.
---
Doing raids is a really nice way to get ascended weapons and armor. You get drops frequently, and each time you complete a raid for the first time you are gifted rare items that can be used to craft ascended items. Raids are way more dependent on skill than gear, and you can definitely do training runs on exotics. DOING THE LEGENDARY ARMOR COLLECTION GIVES YOU **TWO** FULL SETS OF ASCENDED ARMOR. The legendary armor collection is of very little cost, and just requires you to beat all of the first 4 wings bosses. This is difficult, but with time you can get it. While you are practicing and getting to this, you will likely get enough magnetite shards to straight up buy ascended gear.
---
Which instance is that?
---
&gt;when I map completed on my (basic) thief long ago, because nothing could hit me due to blind.
---
To be fair, are you really ever in threat of dying in core maps? Unless you pull Veterans or something.
---
I feel you'd have to literally AFK to die to normal monsters.
---
No. But that's beside the point.
---
You sound like a fun person to raid with, reading your comment alone makes me want to go and raid with people just like you! /s
