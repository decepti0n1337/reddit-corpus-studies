Roaming builds vary.
---

---
Core Warrior GS/Axe/Shield, SB GS/Axe/Shield, SB Hammer/Mace/Shield (tanky CC bot) are known to be used.
---
Zerging builds would be more or less :
---
SB GS/Sword/Shield just to run in to cast Winds of Disenchantment, or Gunflame zerker/ zerker Longbow.
---
---
---
Who needs friends when you have your own clones \^\^
---
no, almost every player use infusion. Chak egg sac is bargin for only 8-9$.
---
The economic purpose of recipes requiring different ratios of motes and charms/symbols is to stabilize the demand, and thus the prices, of motes vs charms and symbols.  If charm and symbol prices get too high, the recipes requiring 1 symbol or charm become cheaper, inducing substitution and increasing mote demand (since those recipes require many more motes).  If charms or symbols drop enough in price, the opposite occurs, driving down mote prices.
---
As for which runes and symbols require 1 vs 3?  No idea.  They could have rolled a die.
---
Note that while the input/output is sound, prices are driven by inventories as well as flows.  Motes are very common and your bank fills up with them quickly, while symbols and charms are individually valuable and easy to store.  It's not surprising that most of the value is in the rarer materials, as those are much more likely to be hoarded or hidden in player's material storage than the overflowing motes.
---
That's the kind of thing I was hoping to see, awesome.
---
With the potential for PvE to get Diviner stat next week (even if it's different), we'll see some new builds on classes again. I've been expecting it'd be very good on either Herald or Renegade, if it's a low-loss option.
---
The hive mind ability is new, a little parting gift from Mordremoth. And remember, Mesmers fuck with your mind. Dragon minions aren't blind or brain dead.

Overly Defensive and Blind. Wonderful.
---
&gt;They either somehow all got forgotten , or this whole becoming a legend  thing is a new way of living for the norn that we only see during the  past 300 years or something like that
---
It's possible but they don't seem very.. newly changed. The most recent change is the emergence of the Svanir and the insecurity some Norn feel after the blow their race has been dealt by Jormag. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Of course it is just my assumption that their penchant for storytelling and seeking out challenges is much older than we actually know, but if that is true then we should be able to find traces of Norn presence in more of the world than of most other races, whether it be a song, tale, equipment, a structure or a Norn him/herself. And that we don't is more a limitation of ArenaNet's worlddesign.
---
Nope, just run a test on [https://perfops.net/ping-from-china](https://perfops.net/ping-from-china). Reddit still has 100% package lost rate.
---
It's possible, but real world cultures with oral traditions (storytelling, poems, songs) were able to pass on stories rather well despite their lack of being able to document them. Maybe it's just me imagining the Norn not just boasting about their undertakings but sharing stories of their ancestors, friends, remakrable feats, funny happenings and legends. I would also imagine that that would help cement their individualistic people to remain a whole and to retain some form of unity because of their shared past.

I remember some mesmer super powerful in sea of sorrows, but I can't quite remember what she has done. Also, kasmeer is a lot more stronger than usual mesmers.
---
No subscription system, no. If you just consider price, the might even be cheaper in China. The main cons of China version is its outdated rendering system comparing to EU and NA, and  its super annoying advertising broadcast.
---
Both holosmith(engi elite) and daredevil/deadeye(thief elites) are played as mostly power DPS in endgame meta, but DD&amp;DE are easier to play than holo. So for high end game take what you can play better and like more.  
---
Also raids don't require gold investment in ascended gear so you could switch around between the 2 as you like, if you play both well.
---
Most of players use infusions, but rendering in China version is somehow outdated. It feels very plastic comparing to EU version with same graphic settings.
---
Both are great DPS options for raids. Thief has a higher DPS on the benchmarks, but Holo brings a lot more utility.
---
I would try both out and pick the one you enjoy playing more. You can even try out the elite specs in the PVP lobby
---
The homosexual one
---
While tomes do help, I think that it's not too difficult nor time-consuming to get a character to 80 (especially compared to other MMOs). I also think that knowledge of the game and things like mounts help just as much.

Didn't someone in the story say that all kralk minons are connected by crystal resonance to modremoth or something which is his weakness?
---
Ive always thought Queen Jennah and Countess Anise were infact the twins of Lyssa, Issa and Lys. 
---
From the Wiki we have Anise :   
---
&gt; **Countess Anise** is Master Exemplar of the Shining Blade, the queen's royal guard, as well as an adviser to the royal court and a member of the [Mesmer Collective](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mesmer_Collective). She is a striking beauty with a commanding presence, and yet few know more about her. Anise is considered one of the most powerful mesmers in Kryta, alongside Queen Jennah. 
---
Note in the Quote "She is a Striking Beauty" and " One of the most powerful Mesmers in Kryta, alongside Queen Jennah."
---
Now with Queen Jennah she has always inspired people and protected those under her, her Throne upon one of the last cities for the Human race where we fight to make a stand for survival. She Protected Divinities Reach with a giant shield and negotiated a treaty with other races to end the Wars against her people. 
---
Now for another quote from Lyssa:   
---
&gt; The two who are one, Issa and Lys, brought with her the hope and beauty of humanity. While the other gods focused on building Arah and beginning a new future, Lyssa gave them joy and helped them forget the past. 
---
Issa and Lys brought Hope and Beauty, always Favoured humanity and helped them forget the past. Imo Jennah and Anise are the Twin sisters of Lyssa, Inspiring Hope and Joy with their celebrations within the city grounds, Protecting whats left of humanity. Although i believe they are not Lyssa currently, i believe when the two are ready show themselves as the Godess, their entities will combine into the Godess Lyssa as was once written. 
---
Maybe not, actually. I think there's a fact a ton of people are overlooking here. Lyssa is actually two different people, Ilya and Lyss. Is it at all possible that one of them is in the Mists playing the part of both with illusions, while the other is in Tyria? It's not completely unfeasible for Lyssa to be both in the Mists and on Tyria at the same time.
---
In fact, as I'm typing this out, I also wonder what the implications of this might be in regards to fighting Kralkatorrik on both fronts. A being that can be on both planes of existence simultaneously could be a very powerful ally, even ignoring the fact that she's a god.
---
Personally, I don't really mind how quickly he goes down as much as the fact the fight and circustances surrounding it feel so.. uninvolved, and in particular the lack of involvement of the player with the means used to take Zhaitan down.
---
Although considering the rest of Orr, I also expected a much tougher fight that we got.
---
Don’t you mean one cold, and one hot dead hands?
---
&gt; Tbh tricking bunch of humans and tricking dragon minions aren't the same thing. Minions don't rely on their eyes, ears and so on like humans do. They have much stronger and intricate bound with their dragon. So tricking minions into thinking their master flew away is still a big deal.
---
I wouldn't really say so. Playing mind games is the very central tool of the mesmer's trade. While GW2 skills focus more on manipulating ether to bend reality and light, GW1 skills focused far, far more on manipulating minds.
---
Mental manipulation is also pretty evident in various places in the game. The Floating Grizwhirl being a prime early-story example, but there's also those fountains in the Great Mordant Crescent Hall of Istan as another clear example.
---
In the end, it's all mind games. And if some nobody Ringmaster from Ascalon or Joko's faithful can set up multiple devices to twist a dozen folks at a time, then Jennah doing the same to a few branded isn't that big of a difference. Whether there's a pre-existing mental connection or not, tricking the mind is tricking the mind.
---
And as far as what the minions receive is concerned, with exception of mordrem (and post-HoT branded), dragon minions only receive a "they also serve the dragon" sensation; it is the Elder Dragon who benefits the most from the connection, learning what minions know.
---
So all Jennah did at that moment was create two large illusions, paralyze a few dozen exhausted soldiers who couldn't move much themselves anyways, and trick that sensation.
---
And while yes, that is a lot, I wouldn't label it as more than what Koro or Kitah does, who create far larger illusions and false sensations, even if they don't paralyze anyone.
---
I would rather have a core tyria overhaul rather than an expansion making core tyria events hearts and world bosses on the level of pof or hot in terms of quality.
---
Isn't that because Salma is a matrilineal line? Genetically, she is absolutely a descendant of Doric, but legally, there might be some caveat depending on archaic Krytan customs we don't know.
---
When did SoI get nerfed?
---
I guess flower hair is largos meta too!
---
Insufferable and overwhelmed, think my gf would agree ...
---
Then it all erupted into chaos .........the quaggan zerg is too stronk Q-Q
---
Shininess-creep is rapidly killing the immersion of the game.
---
LFG tool and waypoints make the game feel small and antisocial.
---
Save boosters for later use - that's the thing we advice here new and returning players; booster can be used to test professions - apply or abandon changes as many times as you like
---
This quiz is gay *dabs*
---
I love this! Coming from a professional illustrator, this looks amazing!! 
---
I hear there are people who team up with anet during those times to find out who deserves Legend rating so they can intentionally throw the games and keep those people in Silver. Something about sustaining off of the tears of people hard suck below the rank they deserve.
---
My suggestions are to buy only when things are discounted.
---
And my recommended gemstone utility items are:
---
1. Copper-fed salvage o matic 
---
2. Character slots if you’re an altoholic (keep in mind this expands your total inventory space for your account by 5 bag slots)
---
3. Bank expansions and crafting storage expansion (later in the game) if you start collecting and crafting legendaries or collection ascended items.
---
4. Shared inventory slots can be nice for salvage o matic, portal devices.
---
I think infinite mining tools are kinda useful but don’t add too much value. Bag slots are good if you have a main character you use for everything. But the 4 I listed are to me, the highest value upgrades.
---
Love skins as a fashionista, I dont mind buying sick foefire gloves or branded mount packs ;)
---
You do a raid without a healer and a buffer and you wipe. It is a hard gated trinity. Hard gated trinity doesn't mean one class is locked to some playstyle but rather, the content and team compositions are built around a solid base. The current base is perma fury quickness might and alacrity. On top of that you need healing. 
---
Wow! I'd love to see what you think of her newer stuff, then! She thanks you so much!
---
Agree 100% it's a very different type of mmo, but if you prefer social, old school style mmos you should check out Pantheon Rise of the Fallen. It is being made by a bunch of former Everquest devs for that niche market that wants that style back. Won't be out for a bit though. 
---
To add on, for pvp you need very little. All stats are available and your gear doesn’t matter. You’ll very simply want enough bag space and a salvage o matic to open all those boxes you get. Your character can easily be parked anywhere close to a bank and TP when you queue so you can easily get by with the basic salvage kits too.

😳😳 Thank you so much!! This isn't even one of my favorite pieces but gosh, my heart is full!

It's a very fun element to delve into, in terms of writing. There's a lot of curiosity between the both of them, and leaves a lot of room for really interesting discussions and trials to explore :)

You can. It's long and you need to dodge well, but double Consume Plasma is that strong. 
---
Last time I checked was during summer when I was in China. Don't know if they have enforced a ban since then. 
---
High silver / low gold is literally fresh account's starting rating.  It's built to be totally average and you're going to be paired with a lot of people who don't play a lot (and thus haven't had their ratings move much from the starting point).
---
Average play in a game like this is not particularly good, and the kinds of mistakes you mention aren't reflective of truly bad play.  Quick and dirty farm bots, young children, people with severe physical disabilities, stoners playing high AF - that's what you see in low bronze.  Barely even playing the same game.
---
If you fly around in Orr, the dragons and Pact Airships fighting high in the sky are really just the size of your character's head.
---
I’d love to see some of your other stuff! You have a real knack for drawing side profiles of faces. I’m always so bad at drawing them 😹
---
AHHH HELL NO!!! You did not talk shit about my boy [Birb back](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Zephyr_Rucksack_Skin) the single best backslot.

Delinquent, revolting, Overwhelmed but not in the usual way. 90% of the time I'm camping Water on staff watching my party run around like chickens with their heads cut off asking me to put them back on for them.

Thanks so much!! Normally I demolish them hahah This one worked out so well, I was amazed!
---
I'd be willing to send you some of my pieces in PMs if you like!
---
Codependent, blind and revolting. 
---
Well, this should work out great for me....
---
Agreed. I redid Zhaitan recently and if I were a new player just playing core, I would not be interested in buying the expansions. The fight is hot smelly garbage.
---
I’d love that! 💕
---
big oof
---
I’ll keep a eye on them out of interest but let’s be honest, mmos are like marriage. You settle down, invest a lot of money and time, and accept it for all the joy it gives you as well as all of its flaws.
---
I’ve started a life with GW2 ~5 years ago, am connected to its lore and world and have a family of around 20 alts with their own strengths and purposes and fashions.
---
I do t think I could effectively balance two mmos, or leave GW2
---
Blood. Literally and figuratively, is his weakness. They vibrate at the same frequencies, or something, which is why that's Kralk's weakness. Has nothing to do with mind. That was exclusive to Mordremoth. All Kralk got from that was a hive mind-like ability in his minions. They can now communicate with each other through a sort of telepathic connection. But it's not entirely like a mind reading. The way the game makes it seem to be is that they get feelings of something. Which is why the two branded can attack the same spot in the experiment.
---
Skimmer can also be used on lava and other dangerous terrain.

If you're wanting to do instanced PvE Necro isn't as good as other classes for either single target DPS or PvE buffing. Necro is very good in both PvP and WvW however as it has good AoE/control and can manage group conditions well.

Ok that make sense thanks for answering

Skillful gameplay is illegal. No joke though this was too strong and you know it had to be done. Stop making excuses to yourself.
---
I feel completely the same. And even the first line. Like, hell, give them a fake name, but if you get suspended wrongfully by a Lama, that is like getting laughed at after being kicked between the legs.
---
Speaking as someone who isn't too concerned about lore, I don't think you really need to play GW1 at all unless you want in game items via the hall of monuments, and having created a character in GW1, I much prefer GW2 due to the focus on instanced content in GW1 and lack of mobility.
---
The extra classes are neat, but I like having mounts and large maps that are easy to navigate.
---
Me too, it was so handy!  
---
But what turned me away from chrono was the new 5s soi. I hate that mechanic it's just so eugh...

---
What's in the champ of tyria?
---
The drop rate on symbol of control is ridiculously low. At this point i think we have enough info to see how low it really is. Even though i understand it is not suppose to drop tons of them, but more being a item with very low drop rate, there is a difference between low and next to none. It need to be raised by a bit for it to feel like this patch was a good thing. 
---
I mean i think all of use was expecting to salvage the gear as we always did and then salvage the runes/sigils or keep them. Not the way it was done were you salvage all and not getting the rune unless you have the blacklion salvage kits which is a gem store item.

I understand and I agree, I'm just saying that a whole society of legends end up with a METRIC FUCKTON of legends that need to be told, and a day only has so many hours. That mead hall will not fit them all in. Anything that can stick around for longer than a day or a few weeks will have to be a legend amongst legends.

Wtf? Zerging without hammer? F1 with sigil stealt 3 boons for enemy.. is the best cc on warrior.. hammer is bedt in slot weapon for a zerg or blob build
---
1. Because it all doesnt look bad
---
2. Because stat and rune swapping is invaluable on some classes. I play chrono and I can 100% assure you that with how often I swap runes and stats I've more than made my money back in convienience and saved in ascended armor. 
---
Theres a lot of bullshit here
---
At 30% off it's still cheaper than at full 800 gems.
---
It's true they don't have to be. But that is not how WoW has historically been and that would be more creative work than they have put in the game in years. And then you'd have the casuals whining that they paid for the game and can't get everything in it if it was that different an armor model per dungeon difficulty.
---
&gt; In the end, it's all mind games.
---
And what it does have to do with mindless dragon minions? They have nothing in their heads to play mind games on. I mean, are you implying sylvari could be saved from Mordy's influence by going through mesmer therapy? That's rich. :)
---
The outfit and some junk. Maybe you'll like it, but to me , I said "No" even though I want the outfit. I'll wait til the outfit is offered solo for 700

I am definitely all of these. Though I only play guardian..

I'm planning to craft 2 Legys to sell, but when i look at the profit from this it is constantly shifting from 1 to an other. does it mather witch one i craft
---
It was actually the very first SoI nerf (instead of copying the full duration, you copied a set duration). I was fine being a boon bot without much worries. Also the rotation was less weird back then. Just drop all you have at once and only Split your Timewarp 
---
The fans website usually have them. They aren't sell anywhere else actually, maybe they are just sold out (but usually they restock with time) 
---
Neither of those places have any drops affected by magic find, so there's no point in using food there.
---
Maybe those people are D/D Soulbeasts? 
---
meh rune/sigil rework was done rather poorly looking back, would have been better if they had just kept a working system and patched smaller things instead
---
I mean I've known some weird fuckin furries, but most of em aren't hurting anyone.
---
actually a blind person can be someone who ignores what is in front of them and actually not doing it on purpose... You know like all those shows/anime leads that never notice the girl/boy crushing on them for like 90% of the story. (and some will never knew about it)...
---
Or a guildmate who you are sharing a guild trek mission and don't see you because he keep forgetting how you look even if 80% of the time is doing stuff with you... (this happened to a guildmate... poor guy)

Isnt the max level 80 or I'm playing the wrong game? 
---
Local deer wants to know your location
---
Gw2 is a lot about exploring: try doing all the hearts, visit all the point of interests, view all the vistas and do all hero points. If you do all this in a map you will get a reward at the end. Do this for all maps and you will get rewarded quite handsomely. 
---
Also, finish your personal story every 10 levels. When you reach your level cap (80), that is where the game truly begins and shines ! 
---
That's definitely a buff. It's like Sand Squall on steroids now... on 10 targets... 
---
Perfectly balanced.
---
I managed to pull off some decent Medium Armor looks but they all require gemstore armor skins of some sort :p 
---
and almost everything are trenchcoats, and i rarely play heavy classes because nothing looks sexy
---
I feel you, I can't stand this  trenchcoats bullshit anymore.  
---
While there's so many good ligh and heavy armor on my alts...  
---
&gt;Then they threw the pieces into a volcano. Then the volano exploded and sent the pieces flying all over Tyria.
---
man, the gods are dumb, who couldn't have seen that coming.
---
the trenchcoat silhouette is an important factor for being able to identify medium classes at a glance. pvp amd wvw armors serve as an example.
---
*cough*

I'm so thankful that my Ranger is a Sylvari.

Go p2w and buy fashions there, or play hot, pof, and lw to get a better option.

Will do! I personally wasn’t a huge fan of scourge because it felt squishy, even with minions. But that could just be me. I used to run a trailblazer Minion Master Reaper. So near unkillable.

why cant i find the "join in" button for playing with my friend? we both just got the game and its fully installed for both of us.

Pretty alive with constant updates, balance patches and a great community!
---
The Ventari alacrity only hits 5, so that doesn't work if you're trying to provide full alacrity uptime to an entire raid squad. (F4 hits 10 people when traited.)
---
Relying on Ventari alacrity is also not exactly realistic because the AoE is quite small. People just don't stack that tightly with enough consistency to rely on in real life.
---
Not everyone plays meta. If the CEO of ANET an run raids with non-meta builds, I sure as hell will too.
---
well we started as the same race and background (asura/statics) and were both level 12 (he might be 13-14 by now) hes done the first story quest and i havent. we also are trying to join from the same areas by meeting on waypoints like you said

Whoa love your mount skin. Could you tell me which one it is?
---
that moment where you got no idea of what you're talking about and try to save it with a joke. Good try. Bye now.
---
Why does this have to always be asked when charr is involved -_-
---
For female armor, there are at least two gem store armors you want to get:    
---
1) Krytan Armor for the chest piece. It is the only non-cultural medium chest piece that is both sleeveless and doesn't look like a coat.
---
2) Magitech Medium for the boots, the most stylish shoes that medium females can get. There are other non-boots boots (Scout's, duelist, and sneakthief), but Magitech look the best.
---
3) Bonus: Vipers for the mini skirt.
---
I needed to hear that, thanks mate.
---
It doesn't. The thing is, there are CHARRS involved, lots of them apparently.
---
Agreed. It's worth knowing what the minimums are, because we can only minmax so much - unless you can approach the mins with say 1-2 infusions, you're going to be over or under by a decent amount in a lot of cases.
---
GW2 is easily better than all mmos out there currently. There’s open world content, pvp, WvW, dungeons, raids, crafting, fashion you name it. The game constantly getting updates and already has 2 expansions. 
---
Yeah those are really nice pieces!
---
Oh Christ, you've been serious this whole time haven't you.
---
Designer hates thief players
---
I agree with most of what you've said, but let's not give Anet 100% credit.  There's not a doubt in my mind that the nature of how the change was implemented (likely the super-low crafting drop rates as a symptom) saw the ancillary benefit of driving purchases for runeforger, and re-valuing the endless upgrade extractor.  The timing for the former is _far_ too convenient (in an "obviously planned in advance" perspective) and the implementation so clearly incentivised that one has to give some credence to gem-stores driving game design.
---
Whether it's a good compromise is to be seen.  I'm torn.  I like the skeleton system as a whole, but like the OP, I find the broad unaccessibility of rune crafting/price point to be unfortunate.
---
Your opinion, but I expected better. 
---
"Most broken thing in history"
---
FGS #4 fiery rush says hi
---
GW2's business model is better than average tho (if you don't count the paid LS episodes screwup). 
---
Just name two competitors who have a better business model. If Anet is "average", those will be really easy to find. 
---
it's hard to be creative when you have 90% less options compared to other armor types.  you can be the best in the world at "fashion wars" but if you're trying to do it with medium armor then you're just going to look worse than cloth/heavy
---
Let me guess, your home? 
---
Yes, and it was beautiful.

---
was available a while ago for 2000 gems, not sure if it's still up
---
Nightmare Court armor looks good
---
That was a bug, and there were more game-breaking bugs than that.
---
Chronomancer is just busted intentionally because it's Anet's favorite class
---
Sylvari are sterile. &lt;3 They can be intimate but can't reproduce.
---
Some of the old town outfits do.
---
Well it shouldn't be cheap to play the literal god-mode class. 
---
Not to the health of my eyes tho.
---
Also from a professional artist: This is really good! Great work on the hand. :3 Keep on with the art, seriously.
---
a mesmer or ele could be a useful addition then, it's of course important what you prefer yourself though.
---
Why wouldn't it be alive? It's one of the "big 4" (GW2-ESO-FFXIV-WoW). Open world meta squads fill up in no time. You always run into other people on maps. Our Reddit is super active. Just some of the signs to show how alive the game is. Also, according to the NCsoft report, GW2 just had their best non-expansion quarter in a long time which means the game is still making money and is doing well.
---
Thank you so much!! I really appreciate your kind words :)
---
It does have the room if you consider that a lot of the extreme looks are the magical equivalent of extreme couture in RL, which can get downright weird. When you're crazy powerful and have access to all sorts of glowy stuff for prestige, some people are going to wear that no matter if it's in RL or VR.
---
It wasnt a bug? Its just they didnt consider people stacking them up by not moving any distance while using it.
---
Also sounds like you hate chrono quite a bit.
---
Honestly Warrior is still more OP then with their irreplacable banner buffs making them meta in every pve team ever since launch. They should have kept chrono alacrity a profession buff and allow them to grant it to 10 people easily and it would totally be balanced then just like warrior still is? Ofcourse not because chronos gave and give quickness too, so they would cover that role at the same time unlike how warrior covered the 25 team might. Chaos all-boons chrono was too strong. But people are hypocritical for saying the toned down alacrity and quickness from chrono for the team is OP, all while turning a blind eye to warrior and nobody complained about druid when it gave gotl stacks and pre-nerf spirit buffs.

As a 3D modeler/rigger, thank you, this is more or less what I wanted to say.
---
Late reply, but that's not always true.
---
Memory leaks and invalid kernel calls can hard reset things.
---
to this day, gw2 will still hard reboot me every now and then.
---
It's an intel i5 haswell, at stock speeds, with a stock nvidia 1060 with every driver from last year till the latest.
---
It passes every prime 95/furmark/etc stability test for 24 hour runs.
---
gw2 is the ONLY thing that ever causes a crash.
---
WoD nerf effectively killed warrior's viability in zerging but if you do it please don't run sword/shield like others are suggesting, take Hammer/GS so you can actually get some strips outgoing into bubbles with hammer and use the boonrip from its CC.  whirlwind and rush are the only mobility you need
---
The cordair and elonian armor sets are the closest we've gotten to non-edgelord armors.
---
So, to get Winter's Essence you need to finish a collection that requieres a bunch of items you get from completing other collections.
---
So it's a time-consuming journey or you can spend a lot of gold. 
---
Winter's Essence itself is a shoulder design that adds snow particles around your character. 
---
The gif explains how I felt when I was finally done with it
---
Yeah... It took me years to eventually end up at where I am now.

The game has a relatively stable population.  Casual open world PvE seems to be ArenaNet's main focus followed by the occasional Fractal, an unstable/intermittent raid-wing release schedule and fairly regular class balance updates for PvP &amp; WvW.  GW2 is in decent shape with PvE updates usually around every 2-3 months usually consisting of a new map with a new story episode, achievements and collections to keep players busy.  I think overall FF XIV is in comparable shape and WoW/B:FA seems to have flopped pretty badly.  I think GW2 is doing about as well as can be expected of a non-subscription game in 2018.   
---
This guild has been so damn popular this wintersday. They do Asura proud.
---
\-Asura Master Race
---
If you want to “win” the fashion game, then it has a lot to do with it.
---
They just want us to spend money on outfits. That’s what it is 😹
---
Unpopular opinion, i love mixing and matching medium armor sets! I really like slapping “adventurer” looks on my characters so having lots of coats options and travelling boots makes me really happy. 
---
Spring festival is in February🤣but we also celebrate for Jan 1st
---
The golem in the background of the bottom panel looks like "Oh shit thats her, what do I do?"
---
Honestly, it's in their interaction, and the Commander's questions on Kerida and Anise. It was pretty painfully obvious that Kerida was Livia, so the constant badgering about the two's relation and how Anise defers to Livia that resulted in Livia saying things like "I've been in the Blade longer than her" and "we've known each other a long time" etc., combined with how she refuses Lazarus' question of having children, all just implies that Anise was Livia's daughter to me.
---
Especially when you add in the older facts about Anise that led many to think Anise was Livia herself - Anise's wide knowledge of historical Kryta, her hiding her real age and acting younger (if Livia has magical longevity, her children likely would too), etc.
---
What's TTT?
---
I dont think it was too strong. It was only strong because it skipped mechanics which could have been avoided by making the mechanics hit through invul/distort. Which they already showed they could like in the deimos encounter where invul doesnt save you, only block does, which released before the nerf.
---
FGS 4 was an exploit that wasn’t intended by the devs. 
---
It’s not really fair to compared Chrono to regular classes, but BannerSlave is only good because of Banners. Without banners the BannerSlave profession is garbage. The difference between a pure DPS condi Berserker and a cBS is like 1k. The entire class is carried by Banners because Anet doesn’t know how to balance them. Druid is overpowered because it's Anet's favorite healer. It's in the same situations that BannerSlave is in due to Spirits being insanely boring and overpowered skills in PvE. 
---
But like I said, there’s literally no class in the game that competes with Chrono. Chrono has been by far the best class in the game for 3 years and it just got a massive buff last balance patch because, like I said, Anet will never nerf it from its top spot.
---
Yeah, I agree.  GW2 has a lot going for it, but FF XIV and WoW do have things going for them, too. 
---
Who knew being part of a pantheon could be so complicated?
---
Back with more questions as my indecision is making it difficult to decide on which class to take to 80. That and the slow-as-hell traveling.  I forgot how much of a drag it can be to travel from place to place in GW2, as I have no mount. Grrrr.
---
* In Hot and PoF, do the three orders still have unique stories and missions?
---
* Is anyone else bothered by how small the ears are on norn males?  I was going to make a hulking chocolate norn warrior, but his ears were disturbingly tiny.  I don't know how I never noticed that before.
---
* Once a player becomes knowledgeable about the game, is it generally 'not difficult" to earn enough gems in-game to unlock a character slot, or are gems still something most people would use real money for?
---
Shit, what do I do with my hands?
---
Lol, i will try to remember, i think it was something like, peircing, condition damage and crit (something along those lines, thpugh i pretty sure im naming them wrong, will change it later) but that wasnt the point of the comment. I just want to know what makes gw2 fun. 
---
1) JP might have been sharing an interesting info, but the actual quality of her work was detrimental to the story (which has always been between "bad" and "sub-par" to begin with). Which means that while the info might have been interesting, and I personally thanked her in the thread, she might have steel been wrong.
---
2) Writing a story does not require "specific training, knowledge and experience". You just need to write a lot and gradually become less shitty. Evaluating a story requires even less qualification. It's not neurosurgery. 
---
3) JP is not a professional. A professional is somebody who can **consistently** bring value. She doesn't qualify. Had she been a lawyer or a medic, the magnitude of her screw-up would have been equal to losing the license. 
---
1. I don't think so. Your main story focus entirely on the Pact and what they are doing.  
---
2. Never notice it, since i never made a Norn male. Lore wise, maybe they smaller to lessen the effect of frost bite?  
---
3. You can farm Silverwastes, or Istan for items to sell, or salvage those items and sell the materials. Then convert those gold into gems. There is still people that would use real money for gems too.
---
Warrior is 26k, because of Banners and EA. Berserker has a higher benchmark on the golem but is only used on condi bosses because it’s the only condi option available and it’s ultimately carried entirely because of Banners being busted. 
---
If Banners weren’t a thing, Warrior, Berserker, and Spellbreaker would all need compensation buffs since the whole profession is carried in PvE by Banners.
---
I don't mind some of the bikini armor stuff, because there is enough of a variety of other styles for light and heavy too. "Bikini" armors can work well for a sort of barbarian/tribal look which also suits a lot of magic archetypes too.
---
"Covered up" is very much more of a Christian/Muslim and other similar influences showing through, because if you look at various cultures around the world, isolated tribes, etc. you find that there are many instances where many don't wear much.
---
I mean, sure, if you are going for a more realistic middle age European style look, then a fully functional and covered style armor is ideal, but it's not the only "realistic" style either, let alone in a world filled with magic; which again, the big, plain styled robes is very much more of a Christian influenced style of magic than many other places around the world; there are many places, cultures, and time periods throughout history where pretty jewerly was the only thing worn during rituals.

U trippin man medium armor has some awesome transmutes and armor
---
There are a couple of medium pieces that look halfway decent, but like 90% of it either looks low resolution, lacks details that make it look practical and interesting, etc.
---
Using light and heavy armors, I actually use different colors, but medium I just dye pretty much pure black and call it good lol.
---
I'm sorry, did you say female Charr ranger? Because I definitely heard someone say female Charr ranger...
---
Fashion wars is basically hard mode when you make a medium armor character. Light armor is easy mode.
---
There are some really good combos you can make with light armor but you've really gotta dig deep and mix and match things. Use the bank wardrobe to see all medium armor pieces available, throw in some items usable by all armor classes like foefire shoulders/gloves/boots. You can make a great looking character but you've gotta shift through the enormous amount of trenchcoat options
---
man your thoughts are just all over the place
---
I personally love rev, but I do switch legends a LOT. It’s a lot of switching, just to keep in mind. Necro, on the other hand not too much and i play it when I just want to chill. I play necro a lot less than rev so I would take this with a grain of salt. 
---
The game is alive and well, to a point. WvW is good on \*some servers\* and dead aside from daily rush on most. You'll see the same hundred or so people in pvp if you queue often. PvE however is usually almost always truckin' along. It isn't hard to find a bounty train (open world boss fights basically) in the PoF zones, and the metas (big, huge, "epic" open world events) fill up in even the heart of thorns zones (old content) pretty quickly, especially during peak hours. 
---
I'd say, over all, it's definitely still alive and well. Especially in the lower level zones, you'll find plenty of people running around out there; though, this is thanks to megaservers, even the highest level zones won't feel empty because of that. While this is the case, I feel like, even knowing that, the game feels a lot more alive when I see other people running around.
---
Anyway. I'd definitely recommend getting back into it, even a guy like me who runs into the new content and maxes it all out in a week and then sits around bored for months, even I find something to do in the mean time. There is \*always\* something to do in GW2, it's just a matter of figuring out what you want to do. 
---
Hell yeah! I'd love to see another. I have no doubts that it'll look great :)
---
1.  No.  They don't.  
---
2.  Not particularly.  I mostly have female norn. 
---
3.  It depends on your playstyle.  I mostly do T4 Fractals, CMS &amp; raid and earn about 300-400g per month on average.  I feel like that's sufficient for me to do 1-2 major gem purchases per month.  There are farming guilds that really min/max and would balk at such sums, but I'm not really willing to grind Istan or the Silverwastes -- I'd rather have fun times with friends and challenge myself than run around pressing "F" or mindlessly slaying monsters. 
---
Or Sylvari in anything but racial armor, or the TA gear.
---
Currently, you're likely best off salvaging blues/whites with the copper-fed, and greens and above with a silver-fed/mystic/master kit, and then for any exotics with a desirable upgrade make certain to use a black lion kit.  Once that datamined runeforger's kit comes out, it will likely be the go-to instead of mystic kits and such for green gear.  But mystic kits and such will still be good for rares and exotics if you're going for ectos, since the upgrade salvage difference on mystic kits vs runeforger's is fairly negligible.
---
At this point it's almost certainly the case.
---
They definitely love thieves. Every fucking medium armor that isnt a pirate is meant to make you look like some super assassin.
---
They definitely HATE rangers.
---
If you look at places such as India and China, there was not a lot of lewdness either, so it's not only about the Abrahamic style. 
---
Probably not, it seems like female human thing only idk.
---
Go sylvari t3 cultural =)

I actually don't mind the medium armor for female

It does not matter if you run Sword+ Shield or Hammer.
---
Both are a joke in usefullness compared to other Classes options.
---
Swing your Hammer all you want but you will never make any difference in the outcome of a zerg fight.
---
A well placed bubble ( which is easier and safer to archiv with sword/shield) is a million times better then anything you could ever do with hammer.

And come on... boon steal?  Just let the weaver/rev/scourges kill them.

OP was asking for an honest opinion about which D/D is better. In this case Thief is better, and some people playing offmeta isn't really going to change that.
---
I didn't hesitate to press that F when the option to kill him appeared.
---
No, but I'd prefer them actually balance it instead of completely changing the gameplay and making it broken another way. 
---
If you're in the same area by using waypoints then you're probably in two different map instances. In gw2 if a reached certain number  of players a new instance of a map so it may be that you joined a map and then map became full and your friend logs in after 20 min and is in the new instance of the same map, or vice versa. 
---
Easy way to beat this is either of you, logout to character select and login again, this would throw you in the new instance of the map, if doesn't work, the other person can do it. If you're both in a party you can join in as well. 
---
There is also a highly unlikely scenario, I'm assuming, that one of you joined NA server and the other EU.
---
Yu can keep drinking throughout the year.

Yeah, I had recently sent him a message too requesting such a thing.. maybe some sort of hotkey on taco where you can press when u are near a marker to select text on the marker itself.

---
Embrace the pirate.
---
Dude says he/she is a brand new player and you're talking about t1 and t3 fracs and arcdps. They need to even learn how to deal damage and how the game works before they worry about whether they are good enough compared to other classes in dealing damage. 
---
Man that's disgustinglg beautiful and creative
---
I thought they are outfits, can you mix parts from those sets?
---
A lot of people have garbage fashion no matter the armor type tbh.
---
Can't decide on a class, huh? There is so much to choose from, I know...
---
Buut due to our new rules the questions must be left in the [&gt;weekly QA post&lt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/search?q=title%3Aquestions+thread+author%3AAutoModerator&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week).

If you think your thread should be allowed to stay or if this was a mistake do report this comment or send a modmail and Pact commander will come take a look.
---
What class should I pick if I want to use a Scythe? 
---
New player here. I've heard Reaper can do that, but it's timed. I want to use a class where I can use a Scythe 24/7 without having to worry about my timer running out. 
---
Love this [TINY] guild! I’ve seen em in the Crown Pavilion. Too cute.
---
Far better then what SWTOR called cloth physics...so many neat looking outfits ruined because the cloth decided it just had to crinkle up and stick straight through your stomach. -\_-;;
---
You care enough to comment on the issue in this very topic.
---
I'm annoyed reading this thread. I made a few great looks for my engi. All of the armor are trenchcoats? Do they even know the meaning of the word they toss around a lot? Insulting. These people are garbage.
---
Meanwhile, heavy armor.... Meanwhile, light armor...
---
That makes no sense
---
I don't feel particularly screwed over. Try harder. 
---
Fucking this.

I'll probably buy it. I like popping in for a world bosses but most of my characters don't have convienent waypoints unlocked for them. I'll happily pay a half hours wage for the convienence, I have a spare shared inventory slot anyways

Not gonna write out my in game name. But poke arbdawan. Otherwise i might pop in for one of the runs later :)
---
That's a really nice outlook
---
Yup, mail is the same way in WoW. Probably because only two classes use it compared to three for plate and cloth and four for leather, but mail armor in WoW generally just looks so shitty compared to any other type.
---
Everything from white to yellow I use Master Kit. For exotics BL Kit.
---
Not sure if that's the best way to do it.
---
It's not only medium. Running a charr ele and it's super hard to find good looking gear
---
PepeAdmire

depending on the wardrobe unlocks it can be very well worth it

Green and below - Green salvage kit.
---
Rares - Silver-fed salvage o' matic.

Exotics - BL salvage kit.

Can I please copy this gorgeous piece of art? I require ALL information regarding gear and colour 0.o
---
Eh, for female characters light is basically..
---
"You're going to look like a slut. Have fun!"
---
At least medium gives you a respectable look.
---
I'm the outlier that absolutely loves longcoats. But the boots? I'm forced to just try to find which ones are the least terrible, and I *still* hate them.
---
Scythes are just staff skins, there are no real scythe attacks on the game. Reaper can conjure a scythe on reaper shroud but that's all.
---
Nope, those are the light ones. Medium gets screwed.
---
Honestly, your best bet is to start from square one. I am currently playing with a friend who went through the same thing. He returned to the game after a long break and was totally lost. So I talked with him about starting a brand new character and we got another friend who is totally fresh to the game and it’s been a blast. He was on the verge of totally abandoning it, but now he’s playing with us several hours almost every night. So if you have a free slot and don’t mind feeling like a noob again, start over and relearn it all. 
---
oh i didn’t know it was bugged. nice to know only reason thief was good again was because of a hug...
---
&gt;main was a dual axe warrior
---
excellent, warrior meta is core spec with dual axes and dual mace these days
---
try and get full berserkers in exotic armor and weapons, ascended for trinkets, while relearning your class -- no need to visit the new zones just yet, you can just do core Tyria masteries
---
the key to surviving in GW2 is to hit things harder then they hit you for, and to not get hit in the first place
---
feel free to ask any questions you have
---
Ouch :O
---
What's the current thinking on Unidentified Gear?
---
Sell to vendor Sell on TP? Open? Open and salvage? Salvage straight away?
---
While I agree that a good chunk of sets are either highly specific or ugly as hell, there's also a lot of gold to mine through to get a unique look.
---
It's also valid for the other two types of armor, but it's just a lil' bit less evident. I had huge problems deciding the look of my warrior and I haven't even started with my guardian.
---
Ironically I received compliments for how cool my then-Engy charr looked, which left me a bit confused since I was still leveling him and wearing the random green/yellow parts you receive through story.
---
It will still be usable but won't be able to keep up with the damage output of Daredevil, never mind the vulnerability and stolen skills. Currently Dagger Training is giving the 160 power for wielding daggers in addition to the old 5% damage increase. It should be approximately 5% lower in benchmarks.
---
It's because Anet hates Rangers with a burning passion that'll last forever. 
---
Open when you can get 600+(the more the better) MF otherwise sell it.

I have a character named Seiba Aturia heh

For a lot of us, HoT was better than POF. That said, it's substantially different.  I personally prefer HoT to POF and in a sense, HoT ruined PoF for me. The maps in POF are easier to get around and pretty much everything is soloable. The meta events aren't particularly rewarding either.
---
In fact, PoF was designed to be almost an anti hot, and was probably created in reaction to a very loud segment of the community that complained about HOT.
---
However, I believe you'll find more people in HoT these days than PoF. I just found it to be a better expansion.  More challenging, more interested in zone design, and the metas are quite a bit more rewarding. 
---
Overall, for me, HoT was better in most respects.
---
HoT rewards you the more you play it. At first you will hate it and feel very confused but the more you play and understand the maps, experience the meta events, get all your masteries it feels like you're actually mastering the jungle. PoF doesn't have that feeling because it's a lot more open with hidden treasures.
---
We're getting 3 Living World Episodes a year. The expansion wont be here until late 2020 or even early 2021.
---
Oh, I didn’t know this, either way what do you think the next coach will be and what about? 
---
What did it cost?

- ...Everything...

Not all classes can use torch?
---
Think Octovine, but way less forgiving.
---
Remove alacrity and quickness from the class. Redistribute it on other specs. Done.

Dont think itll be in 2019, more like early 2020, it is possible, but unlikely. Imo theres a big possibility for either underwater themed expansion, otherwise it could be some new thing, Im personaly up for something in shiverpeaks x3 Personaly, not sure about new things, They could expand on the mounts, maybe underwater mount in the 1st scenario, or something specific for the area of the expac. Player housing would be nice too. I would also like if Anet added some stuff to make the content as repeatable as possible, since PoF extremely suffered from that. Happy new year btw x3
---
I'd agree outside of the sub, but the "Fashion Wars" with "endgame=fashion" is a long going meemee, sooo... That was kind of stupid of him.
---
Well, They implemented those new systems, that should allow them to make the eps quicker, so Id say 4-5 eps should be possible this year.
---
They keep implementing new technology that will help with put more content out faster. They've used that excuse for Living World and for Raids but no one them got more content at a faster pace. 
---
Anet is work on some unannounced projects and you can see that because they're doing good profit wise, they hire more devs but we get content at a slower pace. 
---
I did PoF first too. HoT was still great
---
Actually the arguments about HoT continued long long after the early days. This game is filled with people who started the core game, and tried to make the jump directly to HOT without having done season 2, or dungeons or fractals and they simply found it too hard or too confusing and that still happens to this day.
---
People who buy HoT and use a level 80 boost and jump in aren't equipped to deal with it, but even people that leveled to 80 normally and just want to follow the story aren't really prepared to deal with HoT. Not just in the difficulty of the mobs and some of the hero challenges, but in the complexity of the zones.
---
One of the biggest and longest running threads on the old forums was about how HoT wasn't for casuals and how the game had abandoned casuals. I'm not saying that thread is correct, but for a lot of people, back then, that was the perception.
---
Remember the 9 month content drought after HOT launched didn't include anything but raids and PvP tournaments, and there was an element of the population that saw that as the indication of a changing game.
---
In fact, HoT was meant to be challenging end game content because prior to that there hasn't been enough of it.  I'm not claiming that segment of the population is some sort of majority but they're a really really loud minority, or were at least back then.
---
I enjoy HoT from the very beginning. There was no time when I didn't enjoy it.  Anet after over a year went back and used a quarterly update to make changes to HoT because of the loudness of the complaints.
---
I see what your saying, I personally just hate the maps of HoT they are so annoying to maneuver around in lol. But if there could be a meet in the middle that’d be great. 
---
Are you on a US server or an EU server? Also what areas of the game are you interested in?
---
I can help with PvE stuff, particularly story and open world PvE, as long as you're on a US server. Hit me up in game on Vayne.8563
---
I don't have time to waste on this considering it's new year and frankly I think you're trolling, all that BS talk gear and sets but what you are clearly forgetting  is called "context". This is a new player asking "what class to play for starting" and not someone experienced who would understand how and what deals damage and how to do rotations, they are not even concerned about which gear stats are easy to get and what stats they need in a particular class, recommending someone new ele and mesmer is worst recommendation you can give I'll say as a mesmer main. Giving them a hard class to play right at the start is just going to make them leave the game frustrated. 
---
Let them get the feel of the game, let them know different weapons and enemies, let them play the story, let them have fun with friends and guildies, let them decide if how they want to dress their character, all the shit you talk about is more or less end game content and not something new players should be concerned about.
---
My win/lose is 50/50 now, so im not sure what to say here.
---
I personaly kinda hate PoF maps, but utterly love HoT xD Lws4 maps are ok middle ground imo, especially the most recent one, and I feel like Thunderhead Peaks could bring decent verticality, and finally get us off from desert.
---
&gt; Anet will never nerf it from its top spot
---
Chrono and druid are a huge reason for people to buy HoT. /wink wink
---
I got tides of time nerf.
---
Thats just PR bullshit, don't believe it.
---
I wish outfits could be worn as separate pieces instead of being forced to use the entire thing. 
---
We got 3 episodes last year because of unforeseen delays in 2016 we got 3 because season 3 started late in the year. 2017 we got 3 season 3 episodes, path of fire and episode 1 fore season 4 so this is a wrong statement we are getting 3 episodes a year but knowing this community they make up their own facts.
---
No however I do expect season 5 to have expansion like features and content like elite specs.
---
2017 there were 3 living world episodes before PoF and one after.
---
I main'd Ranger for over 5 years and have had rarely any trouble with armor.  I head cannon'd her as being a member of the Ebon Vanguard so all her armor have the same basic dyes.  I have 3 sets of armor on her currently for different stat sets.  [Toughness, Condi and Power.](https://i.imgur.com/UrizciV.jpg)
---
With a bit of trickery you can make it look like a labcoat.
---
Use AoE abilities not on smartcast, then hover with them above the ground and this way you can guess the ground.
---
Although I agree too many trenchcoats that link is even more samearmor. It's just constant tight pants+chest with different designs of belts and varying degree of coveredness. 
---
I like gw1 a lot but that medium gallery is actually worse than gw2
---
*Communist Party.
---
The government is semi-authoritarian social capitalist. Basically quasi-neoliberalism.
---
It’s basically what the US government would be if the US government weren’t owned by a schizophrenic cluster of corporations. 
---
The US would totally find a way to institute pretty much all forms of mass surveillance and societal restrictions possible if they had the funding and desire. Look at the NSA. Other Chinese government equivalents are controlled by corporations in the US (credit scoring companies, for instance) which are sometimes even more arbitrarily abusive.
---
In China, as described by a Chinese person I know, yes, the censorship is annoying and obnoxious, but in China, you don’t need to carry around a fucking ID to tell people not to call an ambulance bc you have regular seizures and can’t afford a 10k ride in a medical bus.
---
The US was basically like China was now in the 60s-80s, and they would be again if there was any threat of broad change. Cointelpro and Operation Condor were the most brutally oppressive and twisted, psychopathic forms of social engineering.
---
China is more efficient than the US and they’ll be a global power by 2030.
---
You're amazing and you should feel amazing.
---
That's why I've resorted to using my credit card to unlock the ultra outfit addition!
---
My only input is for Norn design - they are bear-shape humanoids - you can see in their sloping shoulders and necks and thick limbs. Perhaps the big head/tiny ear proportions of a bear head could have influenced their design?
---
I like the frostbite idea, too.

Just convert 600$ into gems and you won't have to carry anything.
---
The map with the most underwater content is probably the Straits of Devastation. It doesn't have any hearts though. None of the zones with significant underwater content have repeatable hearts because ArenaNet has not created much underwater content since core. 
---
Found the slutmog
---
In Mount Maelstrom there are tons of underwater content. Both hearts and events. There is a inquest base at the bottom and a Krait base close to that. BLoodtied cost is more or less underwater content.
---
Fields of Ruins have a area with water that have both hearts and events in it. Not the biggest of them but still there are at least heart and one escort event leading up to a champ.
---
The upper part of frostgorge have tons of hearts and events both up and above. The dungon there also have under water boss. 
---
What is the chest piece for the third one? Looks nice. I don't think I ever saw that before.
---
`Merica doesn't knock, because freedom fucking rings.  
---
Funny, that’s how I feel with light armor.
---
Most of it are dresses, and silly crowns or hoods.
---
I fine that the best looking armor are heavy, and then medium (even though it got too many trenchcoats).
---
But light, light is made for female characters specific imo.
---
Sometimes I feel like the team behind the armor set could have done a better job fleshing out armor, like matchingnit to race, and well add some flavor to them, rather than just remove some cloth when you are on a female character.
---
I don't know, but I'd really like to have more boots like the medium boots for heavy or light armor. Especially Plate armor looks awesome with big leather boots.
---
However, I have also more problems when selecting skins for medium armor characters, but at the moment I'm quite satisfied with the way they look.
---
Or lion statuettes :) feel like that is the cheaper one since keys can drop from mobs, reward from certain pvp tracks, map completion, story mission etc.
---
Dude we got 3 episodes from season 4 this year and they are not even done with it yet. Season 5 wont be no were close to done during 2019. Consider they have not even mentioned a expansion, infact they been very consistant with NOT mention a expansion, i think we will more likely see what their mobile project is gonna be. I just hope they learned something from Blizzard. 
---
But not by Arena Net. Infact Arena Net have only confirmed a new season. They said nothing about any expansion after the season afaik. 
---
Prototype Position Rewinder
---
Hmm there just been a sale for a few weekes ago (start december?) so might be a while.
---
Just save the gems for now.
---
And try do a bit of map completion.
---
Very true
---
If your income is disposable why not flip houses? :^)
---
Really? What kind of elite specs do you think? 
---
ikr? glorious!
---
You drill and miasma one city and suddenly you're the bad guy, sheesh.
---
The answer to your question, IMHO, is NO, it will not be lessened.
---
I am one of those 100% PvE players that finds HoT harder than other areas. The multi-layer maps are much harder to navigate and most of it is group oriented. Hanging out by yourself is harder. Example : most of the hero/mastery points are either get there and commune or bring a team with you (thus the trains).
---
NOT complaining. Just sharing my experience. I also went forward with PoF and go back to HoT to complete. I am having to farm HoT for exp points to raise the masteries. The maps are 99% complete but some items are hard/impossible to complete if you don't have the mastery levels you need. The events are ongoing all the time so there is always something to take part on in one of the maps.
---
Case in point: SB and Druid's unlock pieces. Interesting in concept, absolute garbage to look at. 
---
Revenant is a hard class to master when it comes to pvp if your new player I suggest you go nécrit which is a way easy class to play in every mode
---
To add to the other classes, realistically only Daredevil spec thief and the entire Revenant line (herald and renegade) have "melee staff" combat, which is to say that they don't use the staff as a magic pewpew wand but as a close ranged melee weapon which would fit your 24/7 scythe requirement.
---
The only other issue is that you're limited to a fairly small number of Staff skins that look like a scythe, and they tend to be either moderately to quite expensive, or are limited run items (like gem store skins, skins you have to RNG from Black Lion Chests within that BLC loot rotation, as the drops are rotated out from time to time. Saving grace is that ANet's Black Lion Statuettes that drop from BLC's can be used to buy skins that have been rotated out of the BLC if those skins are in that wave of Statuettes, as even Statuettes are rotated out but it does offer more chances of getting skins you missed prior).
---
The only thing about Reaper is that the Death Shroud is only timed from the perspective that you drain their Life Force mechanic while you're in the shroud. Very good Necro players can easily refill Life Force and only have the short delay between shrouds when shroud cools down (as a profession mechanic the cooldown isn't hefty) and a lot of their damage comes from pretty much camping Shroud.
---
The last one looks so sweet!
---
Well obviously ANet has no idea how to cut the boon output on chrono because they apply it way too easily. And every other boon as well for that matter despite the nerfs. So gut it or go home. Same goes for banners and spirits. When a single skill (or a couple) determines whether you are meta or not it's not balanced at all no matter how you look at it.  
---
At least the Renegade/Firebrand combo is an existing alternative but you still need two players to replace one so it's a very half assed solution.
---
Your charr looks great :)
---
Thank you!
---
Maybe it was Lyssa casting the Bubble Shield for protecting Divinity but Queen Jennah might not be Lyssa but still able to speak and interact with Lyssa. Jennah might just have "summon" Lyssa for help and for us it look like Jennah actually cast the spell.
---
Yeah, I main a hunter and I just end up using the void elf heritage armor or one of the pvp sets from legion since most of the other sets are so awful lol
---
I will be very surprised if the announce another expansion after Season 5. 
---
Perfected Envoy Jerkin, it's the legendary PvE chestpiece.
---
^(and it turns into a trenchcoat in combat)
---
Dude that Harley Quinn one is incredible.
---
Medium is my favorite. Light armor tends to focus too much on showing skin (on female characters at least) and I have issues with a lot of pieces not fitting together well. Heavy armor is the most repetitive and least interesting to me.
---
I understand that not everybody likes trenchcoats, but the sheer depth and breadth of trenchcoat hate here puzzles me.
---
your question should be 
---
* Salvage or sell on the TP?
---
And that depends on current market prices for the upgrades, charms and symbols.
---
You cant throw exotic upgrades into the forge anyways.
---
I feel ya, i'm playing charrs only, and i really, really enjoy ranger class, but it's so damn hard to get anything decent. 
---
I got only [2 sets](https://imgur.com/a/UWl6L9P) that i like, been using them for ages and sadly i can't find anything else.
---
Requiem set with dickcape... that one almost made me cry.
---
Dang, that looks so much better than I would have expected.
---
afaik, yes. (up to a limit)
---
How dare you try to inflate your own account value /s 
---
Hey, your charr [looks like mine!](https://i.imgur.com/FAgqo0l.jpg)
---
&gt; I struggle to win 1v1 against most classes, is there anything I can do to change that, or does that come from experience?
---
In terms of general balance and class design, you will always have disadvantage in 1v1, except maybe against Revenants. The only thing you can do to win 1v1s on thief is just being a better player than your opponent. Sometimes it might even not be enough unless you are way better than your enemy, but practice makes perfect.
---
Said that, in PvP it's not your job to duel people. Don't be discouraged from doing so if the situation requieres it, but you will generally loose time and the advantage that a thief brings to your team if you duel people when you don't need to.
---
it's one of the best matchups for thief, and can definitively hold it's ground. 
---
In PvP it's still better not to focus on 1v1s because even if you win they usually don't pay off in terms of time spent on them.
---
My buttcape free charr scrapper:

http://prntscr.com/m1v87e

There's good designs in the game you just need to look for them.
---
People who use ranger-druid-soulbeasts for dueling are cowards
---
I’m still new to Necro. I like it much better than Mesmer. 
---
It’s been a task trying to find a good weapon combo. Really don’t like the staff skills on Necro, but like the appearance of it with my character. Also using axe and dagger currently with it. 
---
I use the elonan legs and chest with funerary shoulders and bladed boots, looks OK :) 
---
The game has a surprisingly high skill ceiling tho, even when most of the content is clearly "light" compared with other games. It's the main reason I still enjoy this game that much.
---
&gt;I like messing up the economy in gw2.
---
&gt;Don't hate, appreciate.
---
Seriously? You want to become another TP baron, not even one with an actual interest in the game itself, and you expect people to just be "okay, that's fine"? Give me a break.
---
I got a world boss portal device 4 days ago with the shared slots promo. =/  
---
Should've waited, like I waited for the slots.
---
I would be okay with this if the gem store stuff was better, but every time I look there it's kinda junky as well.  I have to say it, but I wish they would let players create more armor sets and partner with them in the gem store, similar to what Valve always does.  It's not perfect, but I think dedicated fans could create some really good sets.
---
Not gonna lie, all my medium armored characters are asura because their fashion game is extremely weak anyway. I'm not really into fashion wars, in fact o hate what the game has become but medium armors have been shit since the first game. 99% of them look the same
---
nah, anet said season 5 comes straight after season 4. Its going to take about a year and half to get through season 5....
---
Since this just ruined a 100CM very consistently for 4/5 of my team every time Gladiator shows up in the Arkk fight he spawns invisible, the hitbox does only show where he spawned not where he is. Golems stay visible. Arkk will always be invisble for the 4 of us. While one of us (doubt it factors in but Asuran) didn't have issues seeing the boss. He will stay invisible even after retries until we relog (Character Select).  
---
Probably heard most or all of this but this seems like such an issue, Gladiator especially in Chaos and Shattered did this at least 6 or 7 times in the last 3 months for me (I do fractals almost daily, but only Dailies and Recs so it shouldn't have popped up too much).
---
I don't know if you're out of the loop, but gw2 is one of the top mmo's and it has been for a long. Nothing a Google search wouldn't have told you.
---
I have no idea what toxicity you talked about, but you remind me of Caithe - my favourite character - so you are forgiven. :) 
---
It's always admirable when someone admits to the mistakes and to face all of the  problems and fight them is a hero's way. 
---
No shit sherlock, you should google "joke" and learn what it is
---
\*red nails emoji\*
---
Seems like it isn't just BfA, but also blizzard in general that's being torn apart atm.
---
Sandswept Isles also has decent farming with the large amount of corals in the water
---
Charr female light armor suffers the same problems. Especially the stretched out, weird looking armor. Shit, I think what annoys me the most about it has to be that even their own cultural armor looks kinda ridiculous, and suffered the tail clipping. Which is really frustrating. 
---
If you want to do it on a sylvari, consider instead changing the skin color to "Sky". You won't get the glassy texture, but the resulting color is pretty similar to the last picture and you save 300-600g.
---
Nobody gives a shit.
---
Harsh words to the development but it's a fact so I agree
---
I don't think we will get an xpack in '19 because of season 5, however my guess is that they split season 4 and 5 so that 5 becomes available without PoF and is then used to set up the expansion, much like season 2 does for HoT
---
Female human ranger. One of my favourite looks:

Medium armor tier is cargo pants hell. Most combinations make the character look like they're preparing to go fly fishing in Mississippi with all those extra pockets and vest options. It's like dyeing potato sacks and hoping to end up with a suit. Pirate, Appalachian woosdman, or suburban terrorist. The leystone armor looks like someone glued a bunch of radioactive pumice stones to a safari guide. And every single skirt option is a boxy, stretchy tube that doesn't really move, unlike cloth, leather or even metal, and somehow fits a few inches wider than the character wearing it, like a large, painted traffic cone held up by the fishing line found in the cargo pockets of the other armor pieces
---
Haha, I actually read it as pay to wear, which is a good way of looking at it. 
---
Mesmer Options
---
DPS | Core power, Chrono gs, Core condi, Mirage condi
---
Healer? | NONE
---
Tank | Chrono minstrel (not totes worth anymore)
---
Didn’t do that until last week (finished HoT before PoF came out). I should definitely have done that just after 😓
---
If we assume that each season will have 5-6 chapters from now on, and that chapters are released every 2-4 months, as we are getting season 4 chapter 5 next week, and season 5 will come after season 4, then there's 5-7 chapters left, so that's 10-28 months left.
---
So do not expect another expansion or season 3 until 2020-2021.
---
Hey I see me! 
---
A fellow Scarlet character, I always love finding them and just interacting.. please tell me you use the 'Hero of Lion's Arch' title as well, it really brings it all together. I've gotten a lot of compliments and 'hate' mail (always with some friendly jest and maybe an item or two).   
---
Hope to see you in the open world sometime so our Scarlet's can meet and greet!
---
episode 4?
---
What kind of gear do you need for that?
---
They purposely removed the achievement out of the category so it can be done at any time.
---
While this is human Lore it's inconsistent with the canon fact that the bloodstone was actually created by the seers. 
---
Be careful to read the fine print!
---
Thanks for your comment and a happy new year to you aswell!
---
I thought its for the Amulet only. :D 
---
Guilty. But only because it's cuter than wearing a full trench coat like a lady neckbeard.
---
Yes and no. It’s not accurate that all medium armor sucks, it’s just that 95% of it sucks. We joked about the buttcapes for _years_, but it seemed to fall on deaf ears until recently. 
---
Ive got the distortion nerf. Its actually one of the few nerfs I agree with. This and alarcity 66-&gt;33 where deserved nerfs. 
---
Give me back my soi though and reverse it all to 5 ppl : p
---
Also worth mentioning that people who farm Istan will get way less motes/symbols, as they either sell the unidentifieds or even when opening them, all the sunspear weapons don't have sigils, thus lowering the numbers of "rolls" for those materials. Well...whole PoF actually xD
---
Blizzard is no more. It got a parasite that has been canibalizing it, slowly turning it into Activision's mobile game branch.
---
They gutted Diablo, they keep ignoring feedback and WoW is only getting worse, they have announced Heroes of the Storm is now on maintenance mode and will only get the content that has been already done little by little like a drip keeping it alive, and they have been encouraging their staff to leave the company so they do not have to pay as many people, and shifting their top developers to mobile games. 
---
Blizzard is as good as dead.
---
It does not compare. It's too different.
---
The way it's played, how you have to make your own objectives. How you explore the world and find new things to do. Monetization. Combat style. Gearing and itemization... 
---
It has a lot of differences, improvements and small features that add up together to a completely different experience, and that you may not even notice until you try to play another game and start missing them.
---
It's the little things.
---
Unfortunately, it also may ruin your experience in other games, because when you go play other games after playing GW2 for long enough, you start missing all those little things. And you end up being annoyed when in other games you realize you are missing these things. 
---
"They do, terrible things to me".
---
Something about skinny sylvari and exalted armor just works. 
---
The massive slow-down in meaningful development in the past year or two, the way the story is headed, and the fact that the engine is seriously hampering development.
---
More like octovine where every lane is south, half of the map are boosted accounts and people don't know what's CC.
---
It's only unforgiving when you compare the outcomes of not killing all bosses at the same time, but people can barely kill one wurm to begin with (in unirganized situation ofc). Otherwise it's basically the same type of event.
---
If it's shifting now, it will probably still be shifting when you try to sell it. 
---
Pick one you think would have a decent profit margin and risk it. There aren't any guarantees on a free market. 
---
Upgrades aren't affected by salvage kit quality, only the rarity of the upgrade (green, yellow, or orange) while salvage kit quality only affects the chance to salvage the upgrade (so if ANet releases the Runecrafter's Salvage kit, basically the infinite use Black Lion Kit, you'll be getting better rates on salvaging your Symbols/Charms).
---
If we take, for example the Symbol of Control's [Wiki page](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Symbol_of_Control) there's a note that (while its missing from other pages for Symbols/Charms) states that you'd get roughly 1 Symbol per X salvages from specific rarities. Assuming this is true for all symbols/charms and not just limited to Control then it'd make sense why there's piss poor drop rates on some of the more expensive Symbols/Charms. So you'd be needing to get several stacks of the upgrade before mass salvaging them.
---
I did a small test on this (really did was just get 100 Minor Runes of Rata Sum and salvaged them all) and I did pull 2 Charms of Brilliance from that. Wasn't substantial numbers or data but on a budget and not wanting to sink too many hours into it the experiment was "passing at best".
---
In a nutshell if you wanted to strictly farm for Symbols/Charms you're either looking at using the better/more expensive kits on lower tier gear if they've got a rune/sigil that can salvage into the symbol/charm you want (i.e. best chances of extracting the upgrade along with the gear itself) or invest in upgrade extractors/infinite upgrade extractor and pop out the upgrades that extract into the materials you need and purge them all at once (since like I mentioned, salvage kit quality doesn't affect the rate of getting a symbol/charm).
---
Have you ever seen the light armor?
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Gulbasaur/Things_I_Wish_Someone_Told_Me_-_A_new_player_guide
---
I wrote a guide to try and help with the kind of thing I think you mean. Hope it helps!
---
I play gw2 at work with only my phone, much smaller than carrying a laptop around. So it might be a good option for you. The application I use is called remotr, I also use moonlight and bring a controller. 
---
if i have an extra code for Path of Fire, can I use that code on an account that already has it and recieve the max level boost?
---
She is my hero! &lt;3 too bad she is gone we really need a new LA rework :(
---
Right. But it doesn't give you the rune back, it salvages it.
---
I guess/hope you have a 100% of extract and recycle the rune/sigil, not only extracting (like black lion does) or a lower chance of extract, and recyling (like the others, not always get the extract, but when it does its directly recycled) 
---
Your Sylvari looks almost exactly like mine before I bought T3 cultural. Carapace leggings, Leystone shoulders and all!
---
I mean, it's almost the only good set for the sylvari. It's a bummer to be like most others but it's the best what can you do
---
this one has 100% chance of salvaging upgrades
---
Are you sure? The BLSK doesn't salvage the rune, and the data mined text for it had "Guaranteed Rune and Sigil Salvaging!".
---
It salvages the upgrade, doesn’t return it to you like a Black Lion kit. I would say it’ll give slightly better results than a copper-fed (basically a guaranteed mote with a better chance at symbols or charms), but typically the cost per salvage is going to be higher than the value of the motes, so it’s a gamble. Copper-fed is obviously better for blues, but also most likely more cost-effective for greens too.
---
At 80, get exotic gear that fits your stats (power or condition damage) with a set of helpful runes. Some can get got from karma vendors (Orr, I think has reliable level 80 ones). If your armour was good five years ago, it's probably still good now, though. It has diversified rather than escalated in power. 
---
The elite specs are almost all more powerful in some way than the core ones, so don't go overboard on the armour if you'll be replacing it soon. 
---
For level 80 content, fractals and raids are the staple of the instanced stuff. The Heart of Thorns maps are notorious for whomping you as soon as you arrive, but push through and you'll find some great content. 
---
But have you tried being a Charr adventurer class in Fashion Wars? Few have taken the challenge but ended up just being either a golden smorgasbord of blinding infusions or a mishmash of a million dark colors.
---
Few had succeeded and almost all that participated gave up or went human female light armor.
---
Don't you know the world is going to explode in the next episode? /s
---
They will most likely serve different purposes like how the copper/silver salvagers are different, but it's yet to be determined if the new one is actually better than the others.
---
This is so cool! Didn't he hit the cap of X items per area?
---
Is this objectively better than copper fed now? Only thing would be the price per use. 
---
There are a ton of great options for medium.
---
If you can't make a good looking character in this game, it's definitely not because of the lack of options.
---
Welcome to that, but with everything as a Charr. 
---
Looks like a better version of silver one. That 5% difference in rarer mats looks quite insignificant compared to 20% more chance of salvaging runes/sigils.
---
Feels like total cashgrab. They should have just updated silver one.
---
Magitech doesn't look great by itself but you can combine some parts of it pretty nicely.
---
We get it, arenanet made u write a essay 
---
It's ok if you don't agree with me. I'm not terribly interested in justifying my feelings over and over in this sub. Time will tell if I'm wrong or not. 
---
The first time I saw the Soulbeast gloves, I thought someone was playing a joke on me.
---
No.  They actually just look like _that._
---
It's better for masterwork, but if it's better for rares has to be testet as we don't know the ecto salvagerate yet.
---
I dare say that there’s more info in the story about Trahearne than the other characters. Quite more in depth and defined than most. I’ve been through the all the sylvari stories, working on another Asura, and 2 humans already. Tried all the Orders and lots of info about Trahearne all throughout. Interesting stuff about him and the Order of Whispers. Truly thought that he was the Master of Whispers at first. LW2 had some wonderful Trahearne moments, especially Echos of the Past. 
---
ah cool, learned something new, never knew that. I always just thought chinese don't celebrate the jan 1st one.
---
But what did you say? I want the tea...
---
I don't know you, but if that is a real story and you're being honest then i'm happy to hear that you did the step of thinking about the things you've done and considered them as a mistake. 
---
 I'm also sorry for your loss and hope you will expirience a great 2019 and beyond with your new made sight on life.
---
You just want to fight about this. I don't. I'm sorry I have an opinion that you don't like. 
---
This still wont do anything in my opinion. And only extends the waiting period for symbols and enchantments drop rate fix. 
---
Havok physics engine, ArenaNet didn't get it right, they bought it right. 
---
it would be too good but unfortunately, anet does not do much compared to guild decoration
---
atleast till winter 2017
---
Not only does it come with a fairly massive cost, it also comes with the cost of having to give up another shared inventory slot. The cost and the loss of convenience seems too great to be worth getting.
---
I'm interested to hear where you think the story will go after this season. 
---
Hammer guardian can work, but it's overshadowed by other options. Support Firebrand uses it for CC.
---
Hambow is back, boys! This guy is from the future!
---
i come to my conclusion that if you want to look badass you need to get exotic or ascended or legendary armor.
---
Happy new year ! Cheers , the charr on the right edge looks crazy haha

Thanks for sharing these lovely screenshots! You captured Scarlet's essence well although I was hoping for one mad screenshot of her ["laughing her leaves off"](https://youtu.be/LklhISETDJU?t=27) just to sell home Scarlet's creative insanity (not that we could ever forget her mentioning Faren's "fancy panties" and taking a liking to him when we rescued poor scantily clad Faren from Scarlet's cauldron in DR). In fact, those caps reminded me of this fun [player idea for a screenshot](https://forum-en.gw2archive.eu/en/uploads/forum_attachment/file/147863/gw046.jpg) from the old GW2 forums depicting Scarlet and Trahearne chatting (as much as I oppose what Scarlet says there, the idea itself still makes me smile imagining what the actual interactions between Firstborn brother and Secondborn sister might've been like). ;)
---
I always found [Scarlet's history with the Inquest among other factions](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Short_Story:_What_Scarlet_Saw) fascinating, and her being one of the influences goading the Inquest to cause the infamous Thaumanova reactor disaster was a nice tie-in to explain those mysterious occurrences back in the day as it advanced Scarlet's research on dragon energy, chaos magic and ley lines and gave us clues what she would ultimately be after.
---
It would be interesting if we ran into Scarlet's ghost in the Mists one day to give Taimi's arc some closure (given how big a Scarlet fangirl she was when introduced in Season 1, and how Taimi'd react to meeting her former "idol") and show Scarlet as the sociopath she awakened as but this time without Mordremoth influencing her actions and her maybe willing to use her brainpower to help us with our current Mists predicament to save Tyria (she may be a mad genius, but she wouldn't want her grand experiment to see Tyria evolve end with the destruction of all reality). Even better if we also met the ghost of Scarlet's mentor Omadd and saw some reconciliation between them, with Scarlet maybe apologizing for killing him while under Mordy's influence. After all, she seemed to regret her actions in S1 if using Omadd's name as a password for her encrypted files, having a torn portrait of Omadd in her lair, and her reacting angrily to Kasmeer calling her Ceara (as Omadd had done before Ceara had returned from the machine adopting the persona of Scarlet) during the final battle were any indication. :)
---
That’s the biggest problem - his death was barely emotional at all. The dialogue was bland, no soppy final words. The really good emotional dialogue was in the recent season with Blish, and the Commander was much closer to Trahearne. Go figure. We just got wasted dialogue of Trahearne telling us the name of his sword and who gave it to him, (we knew that because we were with him). All we can hope is that maybe that wasn’t the real Trahearne because the real Trahearne woulda known that. ;) 
---
I think it would cost them too much to make the relevant content creators cooperate xd, not enough budget xd
---
It takes zero courage to post a bunch of shite on an anonymous internet forum.
---
So cute !!
---
It's an investment. They get more players + money in the long run, and as a result we can get higher quality content.
---
I wouldn't say dominate. Enemies instantly dismount you and put you in combat so you can't just ride your raptor/jackal/griffon everywhere,  there are many obstacles that basically render roller beetle useless, and the skimmer is basically pointless unless you use it for heals. But Springer is pretty OP, I'll say that. 
---
I'm not sure if GW2 is a game that looks enticing when played only very briefly and when you need strong reactions from the creators. But maybe I'm mistaken. Would definitely love to see GW2 flourish even more. 
---
I mean greens are more worth to sell to vendor, have been for a while. Only guaranteed wood masterwork items are worth the salvage.
---
Thousands! As far as the eye can see....
---
I guess I'm not really participating. I Let my engineer keep his Iron Legion uniform because a lot of the other stuff doesn't look like it's made for charr to begin with. He keeps his Panscopic Monocle, though. Even when he's having a shower that thing is never far away from him.
---
I have it on a shared slot with messaging turned on. It's one of those things that's cool to have when you have nothing you really feel like doing, but then you see the pop up that a world boss is starting, so you spend the next two hours or so just doing World Bosses.
---
The way I see it, the drop rate is fine if it is tuned around the idea of burning through the remaining stock left on the TP for some runes/sigils while slowly building up stockpiles of this new resource. Of course TP barons kind of threw a wrench into that idea and started flipping certain runes and sigils almost immediately, though.
---
I think we're still a bit too early in to really see the results of the new crafting options. However, I do agree in the sense that it feels you cannot farm for or solo self-found to craft any rune set in a reasonable amount of time. It's a very TP-oriented experience as things are now. I definitely would not be opposed to improving the drop rates.
---
Some Tips and Tricks which always work 
---
Have fun with it 
---
No reason to waste 30c per blue item but otherwise yeah Runecraft seems pretty safe to use en masse. I think I'll still keep a mystic kit on hand but unless I'm in dire need of Ectos (lol) this seems much better.
---
I feel like this might be a bit outdated.
---
Bday gifts and map completion are the most important ones. Bag slots as well, if you bought any.
---
A more DPSy support Firebrand may use hammer instead of mace/shield as their source of protection and CCs. It's certainly not as popular or meta as mace/shield, but with new concentration stat gear coming out soon there might be room for a heal-heavy Renegade working alongside a boon + DPS Firebrand in the same way that Druid + Mesmer have work together. Maybe that's just me being optimistic though.
---
Revenants use hammers as a secondary power weapon when they need range, but it's not a significant player in PvE.
---
Warrior hammer got a bit of a buff last patch with the change to Axe Mastery, which means a Spellbreaker may use a hammer instead of axe/mace and not lose as much DPS. It is still bad and Merciless Hammer will still never be used because why would you take a 20% damage buff with a tough condition to trigger over the much more consistent 21% damage buff with Berserker's Power? All in all, axe/axe + hammer Spellbreaker isn't abjectly terrible and the burst skill is lovely in fractals, it just needs a few buffs and it'll be a somewhat viable alternative.
---
Scrapper hammer always leads to the question of: why would you run a power Scrapper when Holosmith exists? That's the conundrum, pistol/shield is better for support and the other elite spec is better for not support, so Scrapper hammer is this poor, misplaced thing that isn't bad in and of itself, but just doesn't fit any build.
---
feeligs=/=facts
---
It's even advertised on the gem store yet (´・ω・｀)
---
The power creep is the elite specs, largely. Most (but not all) are usually seen as definite upgrades. They're 5% stronger than exotic, based on numbers alone. You need ascended to progress in fractals (a type of dungeon) but it's very accessible.
---
There is an indirect power creep in that there are now more stat combinations available from gear (and a new one out next week) so you can fine-tune your stats more, but they're weighted to be roughly equal in power numerically. 
---
Fractals are quite lucrative financially as you go up in them and also allow you access to more ascended gear (so it's a bit self-feeding but ascended beats exotic so it's worth doing). 
---
I've only raided very casually, so someone else will be able to give you a better answer about longer term rewards. Legendary gear is the "ultimate" gear, and that's a long, long term thing. 
---
so what about silver-fed vs Runecrafter's Salvage-o-Matic now, which one is where better or is Runecrafter's Salvage-o-Matic simply a better version of silver-fed?
---
With runners? ~90-110 hours.
---
yeah but who takes the time too look through 200 items on which gives wood each time your inv is full
---
I enjoy it, even though I am silver 2, and cannot break through to gold.
---
Seems like people refuse to cap, decap and recap.. just fighting off-point xD
---
 Exactly.
---
Ahah the gun got me 🤣
---
So that’s the overarching theme, Elder Dragons messing stuff up. I only think I’ve heard mention of that as a Sylvari. 
---
Well that and allot of guards hate it.
---
The auto is so damn slow, even with quickness.
---
(they could actually speed it up dramatically, take one pulse of the symbol and give it the same treatment the staff got where the auto always does its full chain. That would make it wonderful)
---
Fuck off. 
---
Lmao happy new year to you too
---
Warrior actually is pretty mediocre in PvE, it's just Banners are effortlessly overpowered.
---
Yep, if you wanted to get the most you'd salvage your blues and lower with something else, but since you can salvage from green on down with a single button I just rolled it into a lazy mass salvage category. Copper+Rune's been doing me good so far so its likely that'll continue to happen, even if I'm still going out of my way to look over all my gear there's a lot less button pressing than say using an upgrade extractor to pop out the upgrades with expensive symbols/charms when I can salvage it in one go with a 100% rate (ignoring the need to pop out the damn thing in the first place).
---
Some superior runes and sigils are used in various recipes. Winters presence for instance or some gifts for legendarys i think.
---
What you cannot do is throw four runes/sigils in to get another one out. That just works for minor and major ones not superior ones.
---
Fucking hell just thinking about training it makes me sick
---
It's a little dated, it leaves out a lot.
---
Revenants, masteries, specialists, basically everything that wasn't there at launch. It's still good but I would love to see them release an updated version.
---
Been playing a Druid for a week. I love it. All ascended harriers except one magi trinket. Took awhile to build out . So much fun. I do lots of t3’s but want to try t4’s and raids when I get the courage. Thanks for the alternative food/ oil info. 
---
&gt;that Melandru is really the pale tree. As in she fused her entity with the blighting tree and purified it.
---
So explain Malyck's Tree then. It, too, had to have been purified.
---
Tip for screenshots, just in case you didn't know: when doing an emote you can zoom into first person view, and then zoom back out. That will show your weapons and backpiece(it think) during the emote. Tricky to time for many emotes. But the ones that are on until you cancel them works well. :) 
---
Hey people, get number crunching and research please! :)
---
Very overwhelmed and a bit of a hoarder. 
---
Perhaps for you, but for other people who decide to truly mean what they post, and show their heart through their words? Yeah, that does take courage. Good on OP.
---
He was never 'promoted' that was his role from the start of the pact that HE created. He gave us the role of commander, his right hand. He always made sure everyone knew who was doing what. It's why we had the respect that we had coming in HoT when he was MIA. \^\^\^\^unlessyouweresylvari
---
Once I had done enough PvP to get the Glorious chest piece, I never looked back. I've just been waiting for them to release another chest piece that isn't a coat or has a butt flap so I can mix it up a little bit. He's looked the same for years.
---
Agreed. I enjoyed the dreadful feeling brought along throughout HoT.
---
&gt;  Anet should seriously consider some 100% offensive hammer elite specs

My asura thief (double-plus unluck) is running mostly elegy armor (not upgraded).  Only differences are racing goggles and chaos gloves.  It's not perfect, but it's good enough.
---
[This is my go to Ranger look... the falconer](https://imgur.com/a/j1fPujM)

Plus I love the Gallant weapons set and it matches the theme perfectly!
---
1: And when it comes to size and quality, is S4 really comparable to S1, 2 or even 3? Season 4 also started on 28th of November, 2017 that is NOT 16 months, that is 13. 
---
2: And yet the trailer for the next episode does very much suggest that we are still on track to defeat the elder dragons (Kralkatorrik specifically).
---
Ah, so your logic is that: "Alright the current enemy will do ton of damage to the world, therefore the story is over"? That seems to be rather illogical. Surely that would open up MORE story possibilities rather than closing it?  The human gods left Tyria before GW2 even started (with the exception of Kormir and Balthazar (and potentially Lyssa) as we found out quite a bit after release), so don't really see how that in any way or form would effect the current story thread, since it isn't really anything recent. 
---
Fact still remains that we will potentially use Aurene for Kralkatorrik, but there are still Primordus, Jormag and Bubbles around. With Bubbles being basically completely unexplored territory, which could unlock plenty of potential story threads. 
---
3: Aye, the engine is old. And they do strain it with every new feature they add. But they ARE adding new features quite often, which very much does suggest that they are NOT planning on just scrapping the whole thing.  
---
Actually, I think Medium Armor would look fantastic if only more weren't trenchcoats.
---
I rather like medium gear. I will give you that 99% of their pants look the same. I feel that it's an issue of attempting to be light, but practical. Light classes are nearly always magic users, and as such go for gaudy or bombastic looks to intimidate opponents. Heavy classes need heavy armors, which have a variety of different styles. However medium classes are mostly run and gun style classes, caring more so about being quick and efficient. 
---
The reason they have a pirate/bandit/soldier look is that they're mostly made of pirate, soldiers, and more commonplace fighters.
---
I hate how quickly I knew exactly what that was... 
---
Do you have any data on Mystic versus Rune for rares or junk exotics? Silver might be dead but Mystic has a much lower cost per use so it seems like it might still be the go-to for rares.
---
Except it's purely a convenience item. What do you think Anet is supposed to put in the store if not convenience items? This is exactly the type of item that is perfect for the gem store IMO.
---
Nah, just trying to think of a better term they could have used for Rev...blind just feels like a cop out.
---
Trenchcoat or buttcape, pick your poison :3
---
I mean.. it might just be me, but I for one tend to be vary of games that feel the need to pay popular people to advertise the game for them. In my eyes that just make it seem like the company is desperate. It is also the fact that I prefer people that genuinely enjoy the game to play it, rather than people playing it and pretend to enjoy it just because they get paid to do so. 
---
Can someone TL:DR what each kit should be used on? It sounds like copper for blues, rune for greens, and mystic for yellows and up?
---
Doesn’t the rate of charms and symbols vary across kits? Or is it constant?
---
You can see my [shoulders](https://imgur.com/6CdgdXi) from space.
---
Do they have a number?
---
&gt; allot 
---
a lot
---
Silver-fed is double the cost and gives less lucent/charm/symbol drops, but it does give more ecto. Which is better depends on the prices of those materials, so Runecrafter isn't strictly better, but it might be practically so (someone will do the math eventually)
---
If I play FB and my scourge walks onto the node when the game starts I expect them to be dead within 15 seconds. Nothing wrong with fighting off node in itself. 
---
Not in group PvE AFAIK. But Hammer Guardian would be pretty sweet on open world due to Hammer's large burst and CC. Similarly, Rev should have a pretty strong burst in Hammer and ranged weapons are always good in open world.
---
Not unpopular, just true. It feels like there is so little actual variety in this game in terms of fashion. I’ve been playing since late 2016, so not forever, and I feel like I can just go through and list off every item someone has without much effort. So much stuff is old and doesn’t look good and a lot of people end up using the same things because it’s some of the only stuff that looks good. 
---

---
That was me the the Funerary Coat collection. I almost cried. Trying to get people to do these events is exhausting sometimes. Too many group events getting in the way of my collections.
---
Ever since like S03E03 people have been complaining about ANet's knee-jerk reaction. It's like complaining you had too much meat on your plate compared to the rest of the dish, so you never get meat on your plate ever again. Ridiculous.
---
The rate of salvaging the upgrade varies across kits.  The rate of receiving charms and symbols, conditional on salvaging the upgrade, is the same.
---
You don't run dagger warriors with tactics? :) 
---
It's alluded to that Lyssa aided Balth, but if Queen Jennah truly was Lyssa I'd really doubt that she would help him. It's totally different from any previous writing for the Queen and just feels wrong.
---
No, it doesn't. You need a dose of reality.
---
I have 23 chars .... \*shakes uncontrollably\* 
---
Wow this really takes a strong backbone; quite inspirational/honorable to do this on an internet platform. Most people just think others will forget on the internet, and that might be the case for some situations, but I guess it always feels nice to apologize for any hurt. Thank you &lt;3 &lt;3 
---
\*Might as well apologize for any wrongs I have done, damn this feels like a confessional XD\*
---
I wouldn't use that one.
---
Pretty much none of the 3rd party Reddit apps will pick it up as a spoiler yet  spoiled myself on lots of (non-gw2) stuff because of it.
---
Jury is still out on Mystic or Rune for rares, the increased rune materials might offset the reduced ecto drops enough to make it superior. Higher tier runes drop more symbols and charms so getting 25% more of them isn't negligible
---
That's just being really awful at fashion.
---
Lol, maybe when they revamp the Zhaitan fight?? 
---
jk jk &lt;3 
---
it's awesome, i went to analyze, put in 1g and bought up everything under 1g. it tells you where the merchant is, or go to the tp. the next time i got a guaranteed unlock, it was an expensive one.
---
i hadnt done it in 6 months, looking today i have 25 items that have lowered in price and need to buy.
---
I like the idea, but I feel like for any one to give an accurate preview of an (or any!) MMO there is a huge time requirement. Sure, the target audience could say "Oh I like that art style" after only watching for a short time. Anything deep is getting into the realm of dedicated GW2 streamers. And who watches those guys: people who already play GW2, I'd wager.
---
But, I guess since GW2 is F2P, just getting eyeballs is enough. Then it's up to the target audience to hit the download button and explore for themselves.
---
Yeah, there's definitely a ton of different ways they could play it. Given that her whole deal is illusions and Mesmer style magic, she could hypothetically even be one god posing as two. That's probably not gonna be the case, but it's an example of just how powerful a goddess of illusions could potentially be. We've seen what ridiculous magic human mesmers like Anise and Jennah are capable of, imagine the level of illusions Lyssa herself has up her sleeve. Just the nature of illusion magic itself combined with the raw power the Gods have at their command, the possibilities are endless.
---
And from a dev perspective, it gives them a way to easily retcon things if they want to. Didn't like how a plotline turned out? Bam, it was all an elaborate illusion. Didn't want to kill off X character? Lyssa. Wrong cat won the Divinity's Reach fancy cat contest? All part of Lyssa's 4-D underwater chess game. Now don't get me wrong, it would definitely be kinda lame if they used Lyssa as an easy out for a bad plotline, but from a writer's perspective it could definitely beneficial to have that available, should they write themselves into a corner at some point.
---
&gt; now you salvage them for another type of vendor trash
---
No?
---
It's a material that you can deposit and if you sell it to the vendor, you're a moron.
---
TBH it was quite refreshing to not do that largely uninteresting keypress thing that everyone knows you'll do anyway so why even bother in the first place.
---
Gotta get those elegy/requiem pants!
---
Yeah, at those prices you'd have to be getting 95% or better the ecto drops a Mystic gives you to make up the difference, which seems unlikely.
---
Wear the Monk outfit on Charr. It surprisingly looks BETTER than on the other races. It leaves a mark on your forehead and is a pretty cool outfit.
---
If Jennah was capable of half of what the Six Gods were, I am very much doubtful that she wouldn't have had to bluff her way out of not using her mantra of pain on the fourth White Mantle scout during A Meeting of Ministers. Given that a clash between gods resulted in a sea turning into a desert and a verdant land turning into a toxic, sulfurous wasteland. If Jennah was capable of half that - nay, a third of that - she wouldn't have needed to call Logan to defend Ebonhawke. She wouldn't have needed to fool Scarlet with an illusion decoy, and she wouldn't have needed the Orders' help in dealing with Kellach. She'd have just been able to wave her hand and all those problems disappear.
---
Besides which, Jennah outright didn't recognize an Elder Dragon when seeing Kralkatorrik in Edge of Destiny, while the gods had a lot of knowledge about them.
---
As for Anise, she is heavily hinted to be Livia's daughter (or granddaughter I suppose) in The Last Chance finale of Season 3.
---
&gt; Also there is the question who stripped Balthazar of his power? Where is that power? In gw1 it took 5 other gods to take away Abaddon's power. maybe there is a bigger game played here.
---
The other five gods stripped Balthazar of his divinity. And given how divine power seems to function, his divintiy must be in another being creating a new Sixth god (especially since Kormir still refers to the group as the Six, despite living most of her entire mortal life knowing them as the Five). And technically, the gods didn't take Abaddon's power away at all.
---
&gt; Remember Balthazar says "Your home is a trivial concern." What are the gods upto?
---
That's because Balthazar was being a selfish bastard, he didn't care about mortals anymore. He only cared about revenge. It is a trivial concern *for him*.
---
Even the "no cleavage" option is so form-fitting it barely counts as no cleavage. Female light armour really doesn't have much other than 'OI HERE ARE MY BOOBS". Quite sad.
---
Salvage-o-matic-o-matic.
---
Never, because it's nigh impossible to automatically detect the difference between a bot and a legitimate player doing a lazy low-attention farm.
---
It's around 80%, I believe. Mystic kits are 25% chance of rarer materials, this one is 20%.
---
Gay
---
35k dps benchmark on condi berserker btw and 34k on discipline bs, that is not mediocre
---
I do agree with Heavy Armor, especially for females. Not so much for light armor though.
---
o that shot of old LA *sploosh*  
---
how i fucking *yearn* to explore old LA with mounts, like fuck me man
---
Wow. This is amazing! Thanks for sharing! 
---
One reason I can think of, and I'm not hating on anet or anything, could be that they want people to buy outfits for this reason. If I can use heavy armor skins on my ele then I might not even consider one of the more heavy armor looking outfits and purchase it.
---
There is probably most like defenitely some spagetti code in there as well making it harder than said to get it done. 
---
But considering their reasoning for having different armor classes and silhouettes isn't viable anymore I'm leaning more towards it being a financial reason. 
---
so its good for F2P accounts then? :v
---
Being able to transmute anything would be amazing.
---
The sword fetish is a little bit too hard to fight in games. Sadly.

*sighs at spears*

https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Warrior_-_Axe/Axe_Arms
---
Here's an open-world (general use) build.
---
Don't worry so much about having the right gear but make sure you match the trait build and play around with the skills.
---
This has a lot of stun, so you can beat enemies up while they're unable to fight back. Should put a smile on your face.
---
Explore the game and mess around. It's most fun that way. Do many of the things you missed out on before and don't worry about endgame for a while.
---
That's because with HoT anet didn't quite get the balance of content types quite right. Every map was focused on the meta to it's detriment, probably because they knew how long the wait for more content would be.
---
With the new system i'd say a one meta per Living World Season, One heavy exploration map full of puzzles with the density of HoT maps full hidden areas, one Open roaming map showcasing the region with a mix of content, one map strongly tied to the flow of the included missions and the remaining few either aimed at a specific focus or a mix of the above would lead to a good balance where we wouldn't be starved for a specific type of content between expansions.
---
They should never release an expansion that has maps entirely focused on one thing either.
---
They should also get rid of the idea of a "farm map" like silverwastes or istan and instead modify the map bonus rewards system to so every non starting map has a bonus reward tier separate from the usual cycle that is comparative to their ideal gph then make this enhanced profitability apply to the latest release and one random map cycling every few days. As map rewards are earned by doing events, puzzles and mini dungeons it should bring some activity back to forgotten maps without everyone just playing the same map for years.
---
Sounds cool but i'd prefer if they reworked Necro's current minions (to be more fun to play/visually appealing). Not to mention, if i'm getting this right, you want these to be f1-4 skills like how Scourge's is which would probably be overwhelming when paired with their original minions which are already pretty powerful in PvE content.
---
I don't understand why certain people get so up in arms about afk farmers.  I would much rather these trophies be plentifully available on the ah than have to farm them myself.  I for one appreciate these people taking their time to do this so I don't have to.
---
I know I've been using about the same 3 Chest and Leggings for Heavy for the past 3 years. Different colours, different backpieces, somewhat different (like 5-6) Pauldrons, Gauntlets and Boots, but nearly the same 3 chest and legs: the biggest parts of the appearance.
---
(Primeval Warplate, Mistward Plate and Triumphant Hero's Breastplate, and Ornate Guild Tassets, Mistward Tassets and Warbeast Tassets. Everything else either feels oddly proportioned (Illustrious is super skinny, Glorious gives a massive boobjob, for example) or is just ugly).
---
Like, I'd absolutely love more heavy armour with buttcapes and more medium/light armour without. But if you're partial to anything other than short metal skirts or plain armoured leggings for heavy, you only have 6-7 decent options out of nearly 80 skins.

Realizing how your behavior can negatively impact others is a good start already, good job on that. What's next though, is finding out for yourself what caused you to behave this way in the first place. Toxic behavior will often manifest from things in your life that you are unhappy about, stressed out about or just anxieties in your life. Obviously not everyone is the same and it can sometimes just be something temporarily as with tempers and such but I really hope for yourself that you do tackle the underlying reasons. Good luck.

I really miss new unique armor sets obtainable via gameplay. It's such a shame to see interesting armor sets available only through gem store. I get that they need to make money somehow, but I think you can do both. And that's not just armors. Imagine if you could get cool stuff like mount skins, toys, glider skins and whatnot from dung/raid drops, achivements etc.
---
I have major issues with putting armor on Sylvari, the gloves, boots and sometimes even pants look way out of proportions on them wtf
---
You can't post codes here.
---
I remember that it was originally for PvP/WvW to let you easily identify opponent armor classes. But they made outfits so they completely undermined that.
---
I'd love more variety. Who wouldn't? Fashion warsss
---
You are correct about everything you said. China is kinda of a hybrid. Maybe this is the result of Mao's policy to allow both leftist and right elements to the party (even though it was called communist party). It's not ideal or anything and many things could have been done better, but China has a great development and the quality of life is getting better over the years.

This has been my favorite thing for as long as i can remember! Im glad someone else knows about it :)

What does meta-locking the area mean?
---
Are they going to go back and save my male Sylvari's butt from stiff oversized butt umbrellas by adding physics?
---
Yeah, but you still have to decide which one to use and which right-click option to use. I have max Shared Inventory Slots and I only have Silver-Fed.
---
I'm happy for this item because it means Symbols will be flooding the market and the prices might tank after a few months. 
---
This is also gonna make alot of Runes more available to be crafted, and those Runes *cough Scholar cough* might be more accessible and balance it's current absurd pricing.
---
I mean I personally love trenchcoats so...I've managed to throw together looks I like on my medium wearers but I guess it really just comes down to personal tastes.
---
That's exactly what a god posing as a human monarch would *want* you to think!!!
---
the only part that's "meta locked" is the area where the pirate queen lady spawns... it's been that way for a long time; there's a way to get to both the hero point and the PoI, just gotta find the entrance (which I can't remember as I'm not in game at the moment)
---
in this context, Having some kind of invisible wall/teleport ( Similar to diving into that giant pit in Divinity's reach, which teleports you outside of it) that can only be bypassed during a specific Event. 
---
Ah yes o farmed karma like crazy this wintersday to get all minis from the ls3 and ls4,for when they upgrad it. Im getting all skins under 20 gold :D
---
because this technically isn't against the game rules, it's not a bug and they're not using anything 3rd party to automate their actions, everything they're doing is possible through normal in-game means.
---
Running ess was so demeaning. "Yeah I'm a fucking serf and I know it, pay me runedaddy"
---
If you're running a full support build, probably harrier with monk runes. A full set of armor/trinkets running harriers gets you 67.07% BD, so you can get the rest either through food/utility or through weapons pretty easily
---
Cool stuff! Could you message me which nodes are missing on gw2e so I could add them? :)
---
What about it? Look like Divinity's Arch which is neat
---
Hm.. Also, on a character that's already Map-completed ( personal story not done, just to test that theory ). I could just waltz right in, Was also on the " lionguard are preparing" bit. 
---
They made some dumb decisions early on and the three weights of armor have seams in different locations, so the legs and tops don't line up the same across weights. They've been fighting that for years and short of completely redesigning every armor in the game it probably won't ever be fixed.
---
This makes making individual pieces for use in the armor system require a lot more money to create, and since non-gemstore items don't directly earn money, we don't get many.
---
34k condi benchmark with banners is a lot more than what I can do with my condi daredevil.
---
Warrior is broken. Has been for as long as raids have been a thing where it has always had at least one spot. Banners are that good. 
---
Only those in the maps:-) Check this minus vanilla maps https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Node_farm
---
you are talking about this poi? https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Covington_Keep and the hero point really close to it? 
---
if you are having trouble with those  i just checked in game and neither of them need you to do the meta/personal story to get. Perhaps I am confused about what you are upset about here.
---
I have no idea why, but I've never had mobs spawn at that point in the instance. And I've done it 6 times, each time with a different character. Maybe my client is bugged somehow?
---
You, sir, have more balls than I do. 
---
Do you have spare GW1 codes you can pm me? Thanks!
---
LINDYBEEEIGE

Basically yes, though people are (hopefully) looking into seeing how the Rune kit fares against the mystic for yellows on up.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLLv8E2pWdk Lindybeige &lt;3 (There is a longer version in the video comments) and they also told the spearmen not to use the thing as a quarterstaff which is removing way more than half the evil stuff you can do with a spear :3
---
I feel the whole 'armour types have X properties' (dresses for light, trench coats for medium, etc) is just a continuation of how in GW1 each class had X properties unique to their armour.
---
GW2 couldn't sustain a class-unique armour scheme like they did in the last game, so they abstracted it back down to the armour-type... and here we are. 
---
It worked well in GW1, it gave the classes even more identity. But in GW2 it does nothing for class identity; you could argue PvP-identity, but then you're talking about 3 classes per armour type, which doesn't narrow it enough to be a valid point, plus you can just turn off custom skins and do this anyway.
---
I like to think it is some technological limitation built into the engine (a bit like how WoW's main bag can't be replaced, even all these years later). So it is something they *could* change, but the time and financial cost wouldn't be worth it. Sure outfits get around this, but that could be due to the limitation enforcing a 'one type' of armour for the body, which outfits temporarily replace.
---
As much as GW2's armour limitations bug me, I'm glad its not as bad as WoW's (which is mostly flat textures, except for shoulders and helms (with even less belts, boots and legs actually using different/extra polygons).
---
At least the light charr cultural armor's legs look like they were meant to fit on charr legs, unlike 90% of the other light armors, which are basically skirts with leggings. Looks awkward as hell.
---
Sylvari also have issues with shoulder armor, most of the heavy armors just look several sizes too big on them.
---
Yeah, and my power Berserker does less damage than the base class. It's so irrelevant that it doesn't have benchmarks.
---
You're playing a power-focused class as a condi DPS and complaining when a daredevil with a proper build does more than Condi Berserker with a full damage build.
---
BannerSlave is broken, Warrior is not.
---
see my edit up above.
---
I also tried bunny hopping over top of the walls everywhere and I didn't seem to get ported out. what stage is the meta at for your map instance?

That isn’t a game key, that’s a discount code

it's a discount code not a game key

I don't see any text. It's just [Divinity's Reach with the GW2 logo](https://i.imgur.com/klM8jPd.png)
---
If you think medium gear looks ugly, never create a male scholar character. :)
---
Damn, I missed the Shared Inventory sale again? Bah :(
---
The embroidered pants as light armour are my favourite *by a mile* as they're literally the only male leg piece I've seen that doesn't have a skirt, coat flaps or something hanging out of your bum like the sylvari cultural armour. 
---
(I've just checked the wiki and apparently there's another which gives a better view of his sylvarsecheeks so I might go dungeon delving for... research purposes.)
---
I understand your point, but you have to accept that between heavy and light armor the variety is greater than medium, for heavy you have full plate, chestplate, barelycoveringsomethingplate, big shoulders, big vertical shoulders, big horizontal shoulders, thick gauntlets, small gauntlets, ornamented gauntlets. In light you have shirts with sleeves, without sleeves, with long-ass sleeves, tunics, pants, the variety is greater. But in medium most of the options are just coats.In cultural and dungeon, which are some of the most focused of the designs, their medium clothes are just coats in different colors or materials.

OMG thank you so much...shipping is pricey as hell but since its 50% heck ya!!

---
As a few people already pointed out GW2 medium armor was always about trenchcoats and buttcapes. With a few exceptions. Use outfits to cover the fashion disaster with medium armor.
---
I'm saving this to check it later, thank you !
---
Silver's an expensive Mystic Kit, though depending on how you got them the silver can be more profitable than the mystic.
---
As for comparing the Rune kit to the Silver or Mystic in terms of salvaging Rares or Exotics, people are still working the numbers out.
---
But between the two as an all purpose mass salvage device, the rune kit (you're not getting much from the 100% upgrade salvage on blues or lower since they don't have upgrades but then again all salvage kits are like that) is better than the silver since it costs less per salvage, but its still worse than the copper fed (which costs 10x less per use, 3 copper compared to 30).
---
Naw I ain’t paying shit 😎 good luck funding that wall
---
Dont worry people, outfits will save us. 
---
Trench coats can be great! Having most of your fashion options be limited to trench coats, however, can be very frustrating.
---
Plus, medium armor is the only type of the three that has the chest piece do the hanging (chest dominates appearance). Both heavy and light tend to hang material from the pants (giving the appearance more representative distribution between pants/chest). So medium armor is in a uniquely frustrating position.
---
I really like the norn heavy armour. The stag set, it's one of the few helmets in the game I actually enjoy.
---
I respect you for coming out and telling us that you're gay.
---
I hope you can lead a good life knowing people respect your choice in the sexual acts.
---
Nothing like all that armor covered in animal bones and glowing shit. Yeeep... Need me more dead animal bones and glowing shit. 
---
Gear for more characters, legendaries, u can exchange for gems and buy shinies from tp or a pass for mistlock sanctuary or other areas, shared inv slots, permanent kits, mount skins, glider skins and the list is neverending
---
"Nobody"

Did you ask everyone! this or just assume

Because it looks horrible and promotes passive play

I wouldn't mind a donation for "I wanna get a mount license for Xmas" foundation.

Cool.. But "nobody" was after this guy... you can keep him and form a good relationship
---
We get it.. you don't have balls.. that's fine..
---
I have personally never seen match manipulation, bots and almost never see an AFK and the game is relatively balanced so beside the lack of players PvP isn'that bad.
---
Yh :3
---
Instead of apologizing id prefer if u made this post a compilation of your spicy comments and flames so we can get the drama going.
---
It's totally true, yesterday I wanted to make a cloth armored themed warrior and couldn't do it. Every single piece of heavy armor is either plated with metal or looks like some sort medium armor with plates on them. The only ones that actually looked like what I wanted to were outfits boots which are non-separable. 
---
These sales always happen after I purchased it at the full price :(
---
I don't recommend it right now. Conversation rates are terrible for Gold-&gt;Gem nowadays.
---
I had a similar issue three weeks ago. Awhile back ( I couldn't run the game for 2 years after i bough it ) my guild wars account got hacked.  
---
Since I didn't have the serial, despite having all the other information, payment method, photo ID to prove I was the name on the account, address belonging to the account etc.  
---
Despite having all of that, they told me "get fucked if you don't have the serial number to your HoT purchase"  
---
I could even tell them as much as my original password before it got changed because it was still saved in my browser lol.  
---
Anyways, the point I'm trying to get across is at least in my situation, I waited over a week just to speak with 2-3 GM's that basically just told me to shell out the money and buy it a second time they weren't helping.  
---
I did anyways, but it was a pretty awful feeling, I hope that you don't have the same issue when they get back to you.  
---
If you do, honestly it just seems like a huge fuck you to customers.  
---
Everyone in my thread told me I was in the wrong because it was my fault for "not saving my key"  
---
tf i gave them as much information as it would've been required to get my bank account back yet alone my GW2 account lol
---
Well yeah Anise seems to be relative to Livia ofc. 
---
Also like i said that Queen is powerful but she refuse to fo the work herself , she probably is just acting as an observer. 
---
Maybe she pretended to not know about kralki and pulled logan out of DE so they fail the mission. 
---
"She'd have just been able to wave her hand and all those problems disappear."
---
yeah ofc she could but she didn't , that's I'm saying.
---
for example , Like Say you are one of the gods but you are walking among us mortals , rulling our nation and such but acting like you are one of the mortals just living simple life like mortals but in order to not have a civil war you are using subjects to do your bid whatever that might be.
---
So you have immense power to conquer the entire world but you don't bother with it you are more like an observer to see how mortals behave in different situation. Here Lyssa is very much interested in Mortal affaire and kormir said she was the last to leave so it's just a fan theory .
---
"he gods didn't take Abaddon's power away "
---
I phrased it kind of wrong here. I meant it took 5 gods to defeat abaddon. 
---
It could be anything 
---
This is often what I do now convert to gems, by some of the quality of life enhancements slowly over time.
---
I love Fashion wars, until I try to play it, then I realise there's only 1 heavy legging I like (that isn't that good) 2 heavy chests, a couple gloves and maybe 1 or 2 boots. There's too much junk that dyes awful and too many boots that are 3 times thicker than your models legs or arms. There's so much stuff that is plain unusable in this game and it pains me everytime I go to make a new look or character. 
---
I want a heavy fantasy based warrior, welp I cant have that cause all metal armor is either randomly bulky or dyes like shit. I want a silk/lighter look for a warrior? Welp I have like 1 option or 2 and they don't match and then I give up on it and walk away sad.
---
I wish it wasn't so much like this :/
---
Im glad to hear :) 
---
They're doing nothing illegal. Go play your game and stop worrying about them.
---
I think of GW2's PvE as separate tracks of progression. I recommend doing the story in order from start to finish, fractals 1-25, and the dungeon story modes. From there, you'll be familiar with the whole surface of the game and can choose your own endgame. Choose a goal (legendary weapon, full ascended armor, finish living world episode achievements) and work towards compleing them. It'll seem overwhelming until you can break down and separate the different parts of the game in your mind.  
---
cauliflower
---
Yeah it's honestly uglier than most skins in the game. Since my main are medium I just have no motivation to push for legendary.
---
Does not work for people in South Africa unfortunately :(
---
A lot, the mounts being the biggest thing. You can traverse old content and new content much faster. 
---
&gt; Maybe find a way to mute people who misbehave
---
LMAO - That would be hilarious. If the current punishment for offense X is a 3-day ban, change it to a 3-day ban plus 30 days of no access to the chat window (neither read nor write), no mail to/from users, no emotes, and no user instruments. For each level of punishment, extend the chat/interaction ban.
---
True but I don't see it ever getting better, and all the account services + like 90% of new skins cost gems. Gold -&gt; gem is the endgame if you don't want legendaries.
---
The obvious solution is to only play in ego perspective from now on.
---
It'll be interesting to see where the story is headed and which loose ends from the current plot will be resolved in Season 4 and Season 5. Depending on the outcome, I could see several possible stories to emerge. Below are some speculations for story for Season 5 and expansion 3 (assuming that we get expansion 3 after Season 5, but it would be weird not to capitalize on expansions as even NCSoft was quite adamant on ANet releasing faster and more focused expansions in earlier business meetings as the calls from the meetings have occasionally been posted here on Reddit).
---
**1) Blood Legion Homelands, and charr civil war?**
---
If Kralkatorrik is somehow defeated by the end of Season 4 instead of extending his arc in some manner to Season 5, I could see us visiting Blood Legion Homelands at some point after the map art around the place of Kralk's awakening (Grothmar Wardowns etc.) was updated during Daybreak release which also extended the world map far east (to completely unseen territories in the franchise's history) and south all the way to Istan. If we spend any considerable amount of time in the homelands, we might finally get to meet Blood Imperator Bangar Ruinbringer, Ash Imperator Malice Swordshadow (I wonder if the map extending so far east is indicative of us also traversing Ash Legion Homelands; I'm still trying to locate that evasive ambie
---
nt dialogue from the Ascalon maps which supposedly hint at the Ash lands being somewhere east beyond the Blazeridge Mountains).
---
Depending on the way Kralk is defeated and if parts of his body somehow survive like Glint left behind an actual corpse while Vlast left behind magical crystals, we could see the Zephyrites' fear of people using such remains for evil be realized as suggested all the way back in the short story [The Trek of the Zephyrites](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Short_Story:_The_Trek_of_the_Zephyrites):
---
&gt; We're coming here to retrieve whatever remains of her magical corpus, so that her sacred bones won't fall into the wrong hands. Dragons consume magic, but they do not destroy it. They hold it within themselves like a sponge holds water. I only hope we're faster than the scavengers and power-mongers who would use her body to advance their own evil or selfish plots.  
---
&gt; I know now what great value there is in her crystal remains. Holding a portion of her in my hand, I was able to walk on the wind, ride the lightning, and channel the sun to my will. We will take her back with us and build a new sanctum where we can rise above the mundane violence of the world. There, we will foster peace and seed the crystals we make with touches of her magic, so that others too can experience her legacy.  
---
If any of Kralk's magical corpus survives Aurene usurping him as an Elder Dragon and the corpus, say, lands on the updated area in Blood Legion Homelands covering the [spot](https://www.thatshaman.com/tools/guide/?v=4&amp;x=-111.75&amp;y=1137.75&amp;z=3) between Grothmar Wardowns, Dalada Uplands, and Sacnoth Valley (which could theoretically contain one or two Living World episodes' worth of maps depending on which areas of the three maps were used), this kind of impact would rattle the Blood Legion and maybe make Bangar realize the benefits of scrambling for Kralk's remains to harvest what's left of its considerable magic for his own uses to power up his troops. If Glint's corpse allowed the Zephyrites to use the powers of the three Aspects, what Kralk leaves behind as an Elder Dragon (assuming Aurene can't consume all of his power while still consuming enough to save Tyria from destruction) would be tenfold if not hundred pr thousandfold in ambient magic.
---
The Ascalonian ghosts remain a threat but they have diminished after Rytlock's partly successful ritual from Season 2's "Plan of Attack" instance, ogres may be less of a nuisance to deal with at this time if their migration from Blazeridge Mountains has diminished, the Flame Legion has become a shadow of its former self as its many splinter factions are fighting a civil war of their own for Flame Imperator's vacant throne as much as they weakly harass the other legions, the humans are still reeling in from the White Mantle war and the reveal that Balthazar betrayed them and the gods vanished into the Mists, and the Pact is still recovering from its campaign in Maguuma with a new marshal and new Pact Commanders taking our spot while heroes are worn out due to the battle with Kralk (whose threat by then would've been neutralized), so Bangar may view it as the pefect moment to realize his ambitions without having to worry about fighting a war on multiple fronts. At this time he'd only have to worry about Iron and Ash Legions, really, who he only agreed with on the treaty due to not wanting to get involved in too many battles, and possibly having a contingency plan should the Krytan mice try to interfere.
---
ANet went to such effort as to retroactively add Claw of the Khan-Ur in Smodur's office not only in Black Citadel but in PAST instances of Imperator's Core from personal story as well. The fact that the devs decided to bring in such a lore-heavy weapon as a legendary and display it so prominently may hint at the Khan-Ur title shenanigans continuing. I also recently listened to the old TowerTalk podcast about charr where Scott McGough suggested that one of the plans ANet had always been considering to tackle in the future was a charr civil war plot where the right to become the Khan-Ur would finally be settled between the imperators. The same podcast also painted a rather shady image of Iron Imperator Smodur being less altruistic and more opportunist regarding his reasoning for siding with Ash Imperator Malice on the Ebonhawke Treaty as he wants to use humanity to strengthen his claim over Ascalon as a candidate for being Khan-Ur in the future. I'd be surprised if the update on Blood Legion homelands location and expanding the map east aren't hints at this plot returning to prominence.
---
What makes the charr civil war plot interesting is not only the inherent drama of Blood Legion player character coming face to face with rebelling against their rightful imperator, but also how each Blood Legion soldier in Ascalon would view Bangar's war, let alone how Tribune Rytlock would finally come face to face with his apparently badass Stone Warband who he, for some reason, is not in good terms with if Logan's hints in Season 2 are anything to go by. Would the other Blood Legion tribune in Ascalon, Fierhan Sparwind, side with Rytlock (as I can't imagine Rytlock ever agreeing with Bangar after he has deliberately chosen to side with Smodur more than his native legion), or remain loyal to the chain of command? Imagine if we got a Romeo and Juliet inspired tragedy of player-favorite tsundere charr lovers Galina and Snarl from personal story where Galina, being devoted to Blood Legion, has to side with her Blood imperator despite her feelings for Ash trash Snarl, while Snarl may be goaded by his Ash imperator to assassinate Galina who may have become one of Bangar's top officers by then. I know I would shed a tear if we saw just how far zealous loyalty to the warband and Legions went in rigid charr society and we ended up facing Galina as a sympathetic villain whom we had to put down while grieving this senseless loss with Snarl over the death of his one true love...unless we see Galina coming to her senses and abandoning Bangar's cause at the last minute in a way General Morgahn redeemed himself after realizing his warmarshal Varesh Ossa's evil back in Nightfall, but personally I'd prefer the more bleak end to the lovers' saga to show the tragedy of this charr civil warr.

(Continued below.)
---
I'm still surprised that after 9 Characters I've never once run into that.. The odds are astronomical 
---
I would say that Guardian/dh/maybe firebrand is you best option if you take all the traits that buffs symbols. Got a hammer &amp; scepter/focus DH like that. It is not the best, but it is what we got for today. 
---
hey there. i know exactly what you're going through. i was toxic at one point around 8 months ago. but before then, i moved out to visit my uncle, got abused by my aunt and got no friends here. on top of that, being misunderstood enraged me and i said things i shouldn't. it cost losing someone to make me realize how bad things were.  
---
i'm glad you realize the bad behavior and have the big courage to say it like it is and be true to yourself. happy new year! and hope things are looking up to you.
---
(Continued from above.)
---
The return to Blood Legion Homelands also allows us to continue the mystery of why the detained Rytlock's rank as tribune was reinstated in a closed doors meeting (and why Rytlock can't tell us, even if we're Blood Legion centurion charr, why he got his rank back) as revealed in "Sparking the Flame" mission discussion near Amnoon in PoF, or if we see the return of the enigmatic Monti Scythescrape and finally continue Rox's intriguing [Season 2 subplot](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5oytnd/roxs_secret/) about being a spy and her actually lying to us, the Commander, while carrying out her discreet mission back then. What if Monti was actually Bangar's agent (due to wearing Blood Legion colored charr cultural gear despite charr Commander not recognizing it) who forced Rox to work for him for reasons we've yet to learn, and it all ties to Bangar possibly forcing Smodur to send the Adamant Guard to arrest Rytlock back in Season 3? After all, it's weird if Smodur had the authority to demote and reinstate Rytlock's rank without Bangar's blessing, as that would be severe interference in another legion's business, and I can't imagine Bangar tolerating that unless he was the mastermind behind Rytlock's arrest.
---
I would also love to see the Flame Legion splinter groups return so we get an update on them, maybe even find a more morally grey faction we could possibly team up with against Bangar. It would also help to show that not all Flame Legion are necessarily monsters (as we've already seen some repenting figures like the charr player's potential father Clement Forktail) and some might try to redeem themselves now that Gaheron Baelfire is no longer calling the shots.
---
What's also interesting here is the very obscure lore about the so far unseen Iron Tribune [Fume Brighteye](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fume_Brighteye) as I worked on fleshing out her wiki article with sources. Fume is from Iron Legion but openly opposed the treaty with humans unlike her imperator, is described as a vicious soldier with a somewhat sad backstory regarding her sire's fate in the hands of humans (explaining her racism towards the "mice"), and more importantly is rumored to be bucking to be the next Iron imperator. Now imagine if we got a scene where Bangar, having learned of Fume's ambitions and realizing the threat the aging Smodur poses, reached out to Fume and planned an assassination attempt on Smodur so Fume can use the death as a spring board to take over as the next Iron Imperator in exchange for Fume siding with Bangar in the wars to come. ANet could pay tribute to this [lovely scene between Jenner and Sullivan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwLF9L6V3Ik) from the Secret of NIMH where said villains were plotting to assassinate their leader Nicodemus. I also wouldn't be opposed to seeing more scenes of charr politicking if ANet wanted to be influenced by other scenes from NIMH like the fascinating [council debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RG-fhcO5kkA) if they turned Fume into as eloquent and opportunistic orator as Jenner is depicted as.
---
Although I know it's highly unlikely for the following to happen, I'd want this (Season 5?) plot to also tie in a few loose ends from PoF, namely the Forged army and arguably the fate of Balthazar's evil half-brother Menzies the Mad, Lord of Destruction. The Forged have yet to make an appearance in S4 despite being a prominent faction in PoF, and the introduction of Zafirah as a Balthazar follower could suggest the writers using her to reach out to Forged at some point; if not to help against Kralkatorrik (I'd like to see this happen to redeem the tragic Forged soldiers of their forced villainy) or against Bangar if this proposed continuation plot actually happened. Devona's letters from PoF suggested that a Forged General of the Burning Forest is still out there somewhere in the south as we never defeated any such Forged general acknowledged as such in PoF to my knowledge, so bringing this general back as Zafirah's ally would be nice.
---
Perhaps Menzies could've survived Balthazar's suggested victory over the Shadow Army in the Fissure of Woe somehow, and finds that Bangar would be the perfect avatar of destruction for his uses now that Balthy is out of the way as a means to get revenge on us because we robbed Menzies of his rightful kill when it comes to Balthazar. Menzies could maybe mask himself as a charr oracle and worm his way to Bangar's favor to fuel his rage, guiding the imperator's invasion with ulterior motives beyond senseless destruction and the title of Khan-Ur. We could ever see another villain join this triumvirate of evil: [Overseer Kuda](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Overseer_Kuda) who was off-handedly introduced in Sandswept Isles as Kudu's potential daughter while advancing her father's research on crosscorrupted, controlled dragon minions. If Zojja doesn't appear at the end of the Kralkatorrik arc (which would be a shame as she should appear when everyone else from her guild is present), then the actions of her archenemy's daughter should certainly force her to enter the scene to stop Kudu's legacy once and for all.

Perhaps the ultimate end goal for Bangar's triumvirate could be to use Subject Beta from Sandswept meta (and Alpha if he were to return, although I'd prefer seeing him as a wild card serving no one but himself) to gain control over rival dragon minions to add to Kuda's dragon minion army with Kuda acting as overseer, while Kuda could use the resources in Bangar's lands and Kudu's research (some of which was stolen from Snaff) to expand on building more of Operative Brie's devices from Arah explorable's mursaat path where said devices were used to dominate dragon minions. All of this would culminate in them trying to use such devices to take over Aurene's mind and essentially turn this benevolent Elder Dragon into their slave to subjugate the rest of the world (although in such a scenario betrayals would occur with Menzies probably becoming the true final boss if he, as the deceiver, betrays his allies in the end), thus forcing us to face them to stop their ambitions all the while tying up the stories of Rytlock and Rox (via Bangar), Zojja (via Kuda) and Balthazar (via Menzies) in a fitting finale for Balthazar's legacy on Tyria.
---
Same. Silver was dead before the rune/ sigil update, became a decent convenience item after it, and now it's dead again.
---
**2) Cantha and Deep Sea Dragon**
---
Quite a few people want to return to Cantha in the next expansion, and so far our only hints of Cantha in recent times have been the heavy suggestion that the Zephyrites visited them prior to returning to aid in Lion's Arch reconstruction in Season 2 prologue (where Marjory even commented on the Canthan-like decorations of the Zephyrites reminding her of the stories her grandmother, who had likewise been born in Kryta but who had Canthan ancestors, had told her). The Zephyrite trading with Cantha suggests that Cantha may have become less isolationist to let these wanderers in, and trading itself suggests that the empire must be thriving to some extent, at least back in 1326/27 AE.
---
Depending on if ANet wants to save Jormag and Primordus for the last dragons to face if they're not written out of the story completely (which would be a shame as we do deserve expansion or an expansion featuring them with asura and norn lore, and it'd be fitting to close the dragon saga facing the two very first Elder Dragons whose influence we felt back in GW1 Eye of the North), the next dragon we face may be Bubbles the deep sea dragon who will likewise have benefited from us killing his rival Kralkatorrik (in S3 we learn that Jormag and Primordus are opposites, and it was suggested that Zhaitan and Mordremoth's magics likewise were in opposition, so logic dictates that Kralk and Bubbles are likewise opposites in the All) just like Mordy kinda benefited from Zhaitan's fall. Bubbles has been awake the second longest after Primordus and has likely spent all these centuries feasting on the magic of krait obelisks after driving krait and karka to the surface (and indirectly causing the massacre of quaggan royalty when the fleeing krait slaughtered the quaggan in their path) and possibly battling largos if some of the largos dialogue is anything to go by. Bubbles has already received about a quarter of Mordremoth's magic and possibly some from Zhaitan as well, and some of Kralk's magic may also reach him depending on how thorough Aurene is.
---
Although Bubbles seems to be situated far enough from Cantha if the pattern of krait, quaggan and karka flight from their homes is anything to go by, he may go in search for more magic to feast on, and perhaps something will drive him to Cantha to take on saltspray dragons, celestials or whatever else attracts him if Central Tyria doesn't lure him in first. We could combine Bubbles's coming with a human political plot involving either a weak Emperor/Empress and the Ministry of Purity oppressing Canthans to come extent, or a powerful leader holding the entire nation and the ministry in his/her grip. If the Elder Dragon enslavement plot doesn't come about in the previously mentioned Bangar plot, perhaps the Emperor/Empress may try something foolhardy to wrestle control of Bubbles despite the dragon's power beying immense at this point, especially if the Ministry learns some secrets of the Elder Dragons from, say, enslaved ancient dragons such as Kuunavang or Albax.
---
We might appear on Canthan shores to initially figure out how to stop Bubbles's rampage, only to come across the regime's oppression and plans to not kill but enslave Bubbles and/or Aurene and us helping a peasant revolution take place while learning more about Elder Dragons and the distant past from the saltspray dragons who might likewise become Aurene's mentors. The problems with plot is that it'd mirror PoF's plot a bit and it'd be a bit too human centric when we already had an expansion focused on Elona. It would make more sense to leave Cantha for a later expansion, but unless Jormag and Primordus rise and become serious threats again, it may be the way the plot goes even though it'd be sad to keep focusing on humans who already had such a big spotlight despite the nostalgia for Cantha being strong when we have other races' lore being neglected (notably the norn).
---
it doesnt recover upgrades, it just has a 100% chance to salvage a slotted upgrade, meaning you will get back either lucent motes or a charm/symbol, if the gear has an upgrade slotted.
---
my guild Paradox of the Arcane Sovereigns \[SVGN\] hosts this. :3 we started it last year, and are going to continue to do it every year we all play :D
---
glad you liked it. happy new years &lt;3
---
**3) Double trouble with Primordus and Jormag**
---
I would expect a potential future expansion, possibly an upcoming one or even the last one of the Elder Dragon saga if they want to tie it into Eye of the North, to focus on Primordus and Jormag at once. In [AuroraPeachy's interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfu9z5jAV_I) Matthew Medina and Scott McGough revealed that one of the possible discussed plots for PoF was facing two Elder Dragons at once. This is what likely inspired the Primordus and Jormag plots of Season 3 and could be expanded on once the two dragons wake up again as their thousands of minions gather enough magic for them to rise.
---
This way we could tackle both norn and asura lore at once and give us varied environments as we venture into each dragon's favored territory. We could have expansion maps having multiple biomes at once in HoT style: for Jormag we'd get the overworld layer of Far Shiverpeaks with mountains, valleys, abandoned norn settlements, ancient ruins of Seer and jotun origin with great secrets within, stranded kodan sanctuaries, boreal forests and tundras, ice lakes etc. while for Primordus we'd get Depths of Tyria layer on the same Shiverpeaks maps with lava areas to put Draconis Mons to shame, skritt scratches, abandoned asuran cities like Quora Sum, dwarven strongholds, labyrinthine cave systems etc. each with their unique nasty creatures to inhabit them alongside invasive dragon minions.
---
We could explore the origins of kodan and norn myths, discover what happened to the Spirit of Fire and the lost minor Spirits of the Wild, if Owl can be saved, who or what the ultimate leader of the Inquest is and if there are potential ties to the treachery in Rata Novus causing the fall of the city to the chak as suggested in HoT logs, see potential heroes like [Jhavi Jorasdottir](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Jhavi_Jorasdottir) actually have a prominent role in the story as a direct descendant of Jora, show us more intelligent Sons of Svanir with a charismatic leader figure or two, show us Braham's badass Destiny's Edge norn crew with them possibly being toxic friends who led him astray with their bad influence...you name it, ANet could deliver it. :)
---
A nice twist to this double trouble formula would be for us to initially be forced to ally with Jormag, the arguably last Elder Dragon we can reason with (depending on how forthcoming Bubbles is) as he only cares for creating a world where the strong thrive (and is known to tempt the Pact Commander before as shown in [Frost Portal](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Frost_Portal) hero challenge) whereas Primordus seems to be the closest to a true force of nature who only wishes to wipe out all surface life for whatever unstated reason. I'd love to fight alongside "enemy mine" Icebrood, maybe even introduce female Icebrood who were too badass for Sons of Svanir to kill, and we may finally get inside the heads of dragon minions and an Elder Dragon and even come to understand their warped point of view in a sense. Of course this deal with the devil would make us aware that Jormag will inevitably betray us once Primordus is defeated, so we need to devise a way to doublecross him and defeat him and Primordus simultaneously before he gets to do it to us.
---
At the same time we could get lovely mindgames and back and forth discussions between norn and Jormag, or even Commander and Jormag, where Jormag shows he respects our strength and believes we're destined to join his "pack" of the strongest beings in Tyria where he rules as godly apex predator and we dominate the world in his name. Jormag has already shown quite a bit of cunning and mesmer magic as revealed in Edge of Destiny novel, so I'd love to see Jormag go beyond Mordremoth's manipulations and actually sell us his worldview if we start to think about it at length all the while our allies feel uncomfortable working alongside an Elder Dragon even if it's for the greater good.
---
If the writers went really deep in lore, we could even explore the Pact and how it fares under Marshal Thackeray and the new Pact Commander serving him. Imagine this new Commander being a capable hero but hating us, the first Commander, for not only abandoning the Pact when it needed us the most but us now aligning ourself with Jormag while we're being influenced by Elder Dragon Aurene who may not be as benevolent as she appears. The new Pact Commander might become a hero antagonist in the story and have compelling arguments against our alliance with unpredictable Aurene who may have corrupted us without Tyria realizing it, and we ultimately have to clash with him or her while understanding that his/her criticism is actually legit given our questionable decisions from Season 3 onward. It could even tie into Jormag's plot where Jormag, ultimately failing to corrupt us with his sweet talking over the expansion, finds ripe ground in the new Pact Commander who becomes his Icebrood herald instead in a tragic twist and our dark mirror as Jormag's Commander (although I'd also be fine with this Commander remaining on our side while chewing us out until we and he/she come to terms in the end to join forces against a greater threat).
---
All in all, one could easily come up with many other expansion or Living World material for future plots ranging from the return of Razah and the growing threat of the demons to us exploring Woodland Cascades to help the centaurs topple the Modniir High Command and broker a peace with humanity, explore the ancient mursaat capital and resolve the curious plot of the vanished Forgotten from Bastion of the Penitent, expanding on the Mythwright plot of a potentially nefarious djinn cabal being out there ready to cause chaos, returning to explore Nightmare Court and Malyck while discovering the true origins of Dream and Nightmare, finding out more about Doern Velazquez's mysterious homeland, possibly resolving the Heir of Ascalon storyline and finishing the Foefire ghost storyline with cleansing Adelbern and Barradin's army of the curse and having their ghostly children Prince Rurik and Lady Althea have their happily ever after in the afterlife.
---
The above three topics (regarding charr civil war, Cantha, and double trouble dragon expansion) were just the first ones to come to mind. As we can see, Tyria is full of stories we've yet to explore, and only the sky's the limit where the writers can take us with the rich lore their predecessors have left them with. :)
---
I didn't say remove them, I said remove the idea of having just one or two maps offering significantly higher profit than others like istan and silverwastes throwing chests at you while other maps offer less than 10.
---
If we had a cycle of map rewards you could still choose to do silverwastes instead of running events with a zerg in the current map on roll.
---
I actually think that they should make ally affecting skills go 10 man if traited and stay 5 man if not. You want banners affecting 10 people? trait the banner trait in discipline. Traiting wells change targets to 10. Spirit trait makes ranger spirits affect 10. Etc, Etc, Etc.
---
Stand Your Ground becoming 10 man but none of the other shouts on guardian was just weird. They could have made it if you had traited shouts that shouts go 10 man so at least there's some consistency to what's 10 vs 5 man and also make it a trade off to get 10 man stuff.
---
Either that or just make all ally target caps 10 man so we don't have to play the subsquad UI game. Maybe make it a pve split so it doesn't get crazy for wvw or something.
---
By typing up a tear jerking story?  
---
you must have no balls whatsoever.
---
Hell male norns have severely asymmetrical nipples which throws off every armor set if you look 
---
I get at least 1 Black Lion Salvage Kit every month. I have about 20 spare right now and I've stopped oppening Chests of Black Lion Goods because it's a better way to keep those items from flooding my inventory.
---
And I can't do that with medium? False. Another post completely missing the point - it's entirely possible to look like another class, we just don't have the variety to make multiple sets for that. Pieces from the outfits or being able to transmute anything would go a long way in improving GW2 fashion QoL.
---
Also, the pic for heavy armor you linked still looks quite heavily armored. I'm not ignoring those shoulders, metal plates, and scales like you are. Look, you're even wearing greaves. Fashion isn't limited to shapes, it's also textures and coloring and that's so obviously heavy armor because of those. Don't get me started on the hammer. 
---
Sure takes balls to write up a story on the internet.  
---
"I've been toxic guys. I'm genuinely sorry for what i did and i vow to change my ways. I wish you all the best in 2019 and you will see a new, better version of myself".  
---
See, not that hard. took me 10 seconds to come up with and another 10 to write it down.   
---
Guess i've got balls now.
---
&gt;====New expansion will be in August 2019=====
---
So you are saying that they will manage to do all of Season 5 between April 2019 and August 2019?
---
Yeah.......
---
All this is basically just a list of things that people want or have speculated about. 
---
Yeah, and to who?
---
I like boobs too.
---
Soo, first you need to buff chronos up to 10ppl boon generation and then buff firebrand in the same way to allow it to compete with chrono? What is exactly the point of this step, can we skip it please?
---
I actually didn't think you'd take me seriously. I was kinda just posting the typical "got gold? Nothing to do? Give it to me" post. I mean, if you wanna send me one I wouldn't complaint. At all. Would be the only thing I got for the holidays lol, besides a bad case of allergies and a headache from really loud neighbors. 
---
Man this is so low effort :c 
---
I remember one of them still clipped through the tail, but yeah, for the most part, it's still better than a lot of the leg armors. 
---
The Mac client is in no way optimized, but on my 2018 MacBook Pro 15" I get a decent 30 FPS at 1440x900 on complex areas such as the Verdant Brink, with most settings set to Medium and a couple set to Low and Lowest (respectively Character Model Quality and Character Model Limit).
---
I know this is far from optimal, compared to Windows, but at least it's very stable and I gladly forgot all those crashes from the 32 bit version. It's worth giving a try, IMO.
---
thanks for sharing
---
Yeah thats beautiful
---
So that's just a list of what people want not actual leaks ?
---
I'm not complaining btw, just pointing out that it would be nice to be able to obtain some new stuff through in-game means. To be fair, I can't really count PoF armors to be "new" anymore. The birthday armor is interesting, but all I had to do to get it was open a chest (and tbh, I find that armor ulgy but that's just my opinion). Can't really talk about the lastest LW armor, since I haven't played it yet, but I guess you jsut get it for completing the story mission or something?
---
I love how people take the time to come up with speculations and predictions and yet always forget that there will be a 5th season first.
---
If the rewards weren't noticeably better on the fram maps, the farmers would leave. 
---
I stick to slot of cultural armour and the old toxic gloves and shoulder for this reason on my reaper, haven't food other stuff that looks/feels right otherwise
---
As long as they arnt hurting anyone, or getting in the way of events I dont see why its a problem. I personally dont have any interest or class for afk farming, but ive got no problem with people doing it. If thats how they want to play the game so be it.
---
&gt; Two chronos for every raid. That's been the bread and butter of every raid since their inception.  
---
Raids did NOT start as 2 chronos per raid. In the beginning, it was 1 chrono until nerfs made 2 chronos a necessity.
---
Welcome to 2019, GW2!  So many years now, so much to do.
---
* Pretty sure we're done with bloodstone storylines.
---
* They won't introduce a mount that makes the griffon irrelevant.
---
* Wizard's Tower raid will probably never happen.
---
* There will definitely be more than one raid before the next expansion.
---
* There is an entire season of Living World before the next expansion.
---
* There's no such thing as "the bloody legion".
---
* I don't think you know what antipode means.
---
* Highly doubt there will ever be new playable races.
---
* Replacing the home instance system doesn't any sense as there has been so much added to it and so much of the personal story relies on it.
---
* Reworks of vanilla classes in theory are constantly in progress, not expansion features and not launched alongside a whole set of new elite specs.
---
So yea, I'm going to go with not believing.
---
I'm just wondering why you feel the need to be an arse.
---
Clearly the guy felt like making it.. and yet.. it offended you that much you had to shit on his apology.
---
I mean.. that's sad.
---
[This](https://i.imgur.com/kjLbkUu.png) is one of the only non cleavage looks I managed to do. It is pretty hard tbh. And I hate how they add some skins like the elegy and requiem stuff and then proceed to add stupidly big metal bits or scales to them. Like, I just want a few nice and functional armor skins but even when I get them they're bad.
---
Not only that but these lame ass confessions and resolutions are just setting yourself up for failure. Just fucking change, you don't need to set dates and write novels about it. When you fail then it seems like "well my goal is ruined let's fuck off now".
---
This is a classic case of "not your blog".
---
This is what kills me.  
---
For a game focused on aesthetic progression, there's really very little of it in terms of armors. Weapons, sure, there are about a billion and one to choose from. Outfits, yeah there are quite a few of those as well, though it has been a frequent complaint that they're not malleable enough to be satisfying.  
---
I feel like GW2's armor styles are all trying too hard to fit a theme and share a lot of common features as well as often being _too_ eccentric. Maybe the artists behind the designs want people to be able to see the styles and instantly think "GW2" but, it's not hard to conclude that that would significantly limit creative direction.  
---
There are many truly great looking armors and it's reasonable to have lots of less great looking ones as well. Sometimes the more unpopular armors are best used to compliment unique styles like cosplays or as individual pieces to complete someone's perfect look. But as a whole, GW2's armors are mostly very boring or frustrating when compared to the scope of weapon skins and the artistic potential the game has. There are _way_ too many damn NPC's in the Path of Fire maps that have _beautiful_ clothing for example.  
---
I am an absolute die hard for character creation/customization. I'll change my characters looks dozens of times _a day._ That's why I bought the Permanent Self-Style Hair Kit and that's why I have thousands of Transmutation Charges, almost all Dyes unlocked, all Cultural armor and almost every outfit... And yet... I still tend to stick to only a very, very small handful of specific pieces because I'm so unsatisfied with everything else. I'm sure some people love what GW2 has to offer but, clearly I'm not the only one who feels disappointed either.
---
no one, but it seems i hurt you for disagreeing lmao. that takes weak character
---
Even though they may be missing a lot there is still an enormous amount of content they have access to. 
---
Well you don't use mace mace for damage, you use it for cc so if hammer cc is less it is worse.
---
&gt;even if we do have 1/4 of our chest wardrobe being trenchcoats.
---
&gt;1/4 
---
LMAO, [you wish](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Human_female_medium_armor). 
---
I feel revolting.
---
That's definitely what i think i will do overtime, but i need to find a moneymaking way first i think \^\^
---
good for you. i salvaged over 800 exotics today. glhf doing that with your free bl kit
---
Go for ascended armour and weapons that will keep you busy enough 
---
as all things should be
---
I think starting over from 0 is the best strat. Find someone to play with, and just keep asking questions here or in map chat until you know whats happening.
---
Me parece problema de tu tarjeta grafica, que es lo que tiene? Me parece curioso que ese dato no lo incluyieras.
---
I want my gems back.
---
It **DESTROYS** upgrades and gives you motes/charms.  It doesn't put the upgrade in your inventory like the old days, which is what I was expecting.  I bought this because I thought it would finally return some pre-runesalvage normalcy.  So I can get a rune out of something I'm salvaging to put that rune in something else.  Nope!  I expected to have 3 runes and 1 sigil in my inventory after opening some unid items and then salvaging them with this.  Nope!  I got 3 motes and a charm instead.
---
https://i.imgur.com/MjZQD5F.png
---
I really want my gems back.  The language on the item convinced me this had functionality that it simply doesn't have.
---
yes both infusions were missing from my account. i contacted support and they were able to help me. i'm so sorry if it didnt work for you ;(
---
Best rates we had when PoF launched and everybody converted gems to gold to cash out for the Griffon. It was like 100 gold for 400 gems? Also I agree, I don't see anything coming that will cost nearly that much in gold and will be as desired as the Griffon. Not until a new Expansion, that is.
---
You yourself just said you'd prefer to play in such a map so there would still be enough players for both options.
---
no ingles no bueno
---
The difference in breakbar damage is 50 for the first activations of all CC skills, once the burst skill is back up and CC is still needed the mace gets an even bigger advantage (mace Lv3 burst is 300, hammer Lv3 burst is 200). 
---
Also mace #3 has a lower cooldown than hammer #4 while #5 is same for both. If it's all about CC mace is definitely the way to go.
---
Yes. I suspect my reaction was similar to the character it was happening to. No, no, no stop showing me this I don't want to see it any more. Stoooooooop
---
You know, this may be an unpopular opinion, but I think there is certainly a kind of fun in theorycrafting the best comp for what you've got (knowing which classes need spotter, ensuring the healer is in the tank's subgroup, figuring out how to make up for fury/might deficits in subgroups without druids, making sure assassin's presence and empower allies are with the power classes, putting guardians in the same subgroup to share retaliation uptime, etc).
---
As someone who frequently commands squads, I do enjoy this kind of preparation and the incremental increases in DPS that deeper knowledge of the meta will yield. Making everything 10-man kills a lot of that. I think fixing double chrono doesn't necessarily have to come from standardising *everything* to 10 buffs. It should be done by effecting targeted changes and tweaks to balance such that taking a second chrono is redundant, just like how taking a second druid nowadays is also often redundant.
---
projecting
---
ur pretty much a new player at this point. 
---
just read new player guides. its pretty good. 
---
dont delete your old chars, they get cool gifts
---
Off topic but that is a cool af character
---
nice faceless youtube channel you ugly cunt
---
I think i have a free char slot still would it be hard for me to pick back up my 80 mesmer or should i just start a new char then maybe go back to mesmer
---
Nor in Canada. 
---
Just make a new account she's guy what did u say to ppl that turned u into such a baby?
---
I'm talking data
---
that doesn't get updated much you know. literally dude. the only reason it's yellow is because you could be playing banners instead. 
---
or hell you could look at average pug performance on the surprisingly common dps berserkers versus the not very common condi dds. mayhaps that's for a reason? 
---
If I were to get a new laptop i would check out hp omen.
---
Level a new character first, once you feel comfortable, switch back to your mesmer if you wish - mesmer is not exactly the easiest class to get back into the game. :)
---
From what I can tell from the channel of the person who posted the video, this is the only guide they've done.
---
&gt; CMV
---
Alright. Challenge accepted.
---
&gt; Those skins didn't clip because they were designed for a single race and tailored with much simpler models, it has little to do with design ideals.
---
I will concede this point, though I mention in [another comment in this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/abkj9i/unpopular_opinion_light_and_heavy_armor_lack/ed16ciq/) that pretty much all races suffer from issues of armor being wrapped/proportioned poorly, and I feel that this contributes more to clipping than the armor designs themselves. If these models were tailored more effectively, I don't think there would be nearly as much concern for clipping from one race to another. (Though, I'm not a professional so this is far from an informed opinion. Just what I've noticed.)
---
&gt; I also found them even samier than GW2 skins
---
&gt; I don't think the GW1 looks were very iconic at all
---
I'm gonna merge these two together for this response.
---
So, when I say iconic in this context, I mean that they had a very specific flavor that makes GW1 fashion very distinct from GW2 fashion. There's a severe lack of armor in GW2 that feels reminiscent of GW1.
---
However, I feel that, while diving deeper into each layer of distinction, you find quite a wide variety.
---
Also, I should mention that you brought up "designed for a single race" as though GW1 models were all the same. While not always a particularly obvious difference, different professions had different postures, body types, and emotes. So they weren't nearly as "one size fits all." For the most part, all races in GW2 aside from charr are humanoid-ish, so that should be vaguely comparable.
---
I bring that up here because armor wasn't the only thing making players distinct in GW1.
---
So, each profession was very rooted in the stylistic elements of their theme. For instance, it's very easy to distinguish a necromancer from a mesmer, no matter what armor each one is wearing. **This means that, for all the armor that was made, they had a lot of room to play with and elaborate on those themes** rather than making one generic "death-y" look and one generic "mystical" look. They had to make plenty of options for each one.
---
Take elementalist: they have different armor sets for [fire](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Elementalist_Flameforged_armor), [water](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Elementalist_Iceforged_armor), [earth](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Elementalist_Stoneforged_armor), and [air](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Elementalist_Stormforged_armor). And then each of these sets had "elite" variants, too, where each style was refined and made a bit fancier. In the case of Stormforged, it took [a pretty awful look](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/File:Elementalist_Stormforged_armor_m.jpg) and made it [actually really cool](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/File:Elementalist_Elite_Stormforged_armor_m.jpg).
---
And when they expanded to other regions of the world, new styles emerged, showing off different interpretations of each profession unique to the culture of each continent.
---
Looking to necromancers:
---
- Tyrian designs tend to be very [Gothic](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/File:Necromancer_Elite_Cultist_armor_f.jpg), often using [strategic skin windows](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/File:Necromancer_Krytan_armor_f.jpg) to show that "edge" of knowing it isn't proper but not caring anyway. This could easily be considered a very fetishized style for necromancers.
---
- Compare that to the Canthan style, which [focuses far less on blatant sex appeal](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/File:Necromancer_Canthan_armor_f.jpg) and instead hones in on the more [demonic](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/File:Necromancer_Elite_Canthan_armor_f.jpg) or [visceral flesh and bone](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/File:Necromancer_Elite_Luxon_armor_f.jpg) of necromancy.
---
- Meanwhile in Elona, necromancers have more of a [ritualistic flair](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/File:Necromancer_Ancient_armor_f.jpg), where the skin is less about lust and more about tradition. There's also a distinct use of [skin discoloration or body paint](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/File:Necromancer_Istani_armor_f.jpg) that is not used by other continents.
---
Or here are three examples from monk armor: [one](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/File:Monk_Elite_Woven_armor_m.jpg), [two](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/File:Monk_Canthan_armor_m.jpg), [three](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/File:Monk_Elite_Sunspear_armor_m.jpg).  I bet you can easily tell at a glance where each one comes from.
---
Compare that to GW2, where something like necromancer-specific armor isn't a thing anymore.  The most "necromantic" armor I can think of are:
---
- [Dry Bones](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dry_Bones_armor), probably the most blatantly necromancer-themed armor.  But this is pretty rough. A great look, but not remotely elegant like some of my favorite GW1 necro sets.
---
- [Apostle armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Apostle_armor), probably a stretch to be considered "necro-themed," but vaguely cult-y and mildly elegant. But also a horribly neglected set for many years in GW2. Also lacks the personality and edge that defined Tyrian necromancers in GW1.
---
- [Primitive armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Primitive_armor), oh please. Just because it has a skull on it does not make it necro-themed.
---
- [Armor of the Lich](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Armor_of_the_Lich), I mean this is based on Zhaitan, so I wouldn't say it totally counts. But there's a bizarre death theme there, I guess?
---
- [Trickster Armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Trickster%27s_armor), worn by our familiar necromancer friend.  This certainly has potential in some elements, but it could just as easily be attributed to mesmers. I mean, it has a face mask and it's called trickster. So yeah.
---
GW2 has a much less thorough approach to armor. And in a few ways, that's great. We don't want to get too same-y with it. But it also has a huge risk of being "so close but X ruined it." In fact, some armor sets in GW2 look laughable to me, and it takes mixing and matching to make them work at all. On the flips side, there are few sets in GW1 that don't work on their own.
---
**All this to say,** you're right that GW1 looks weren't inherently better or more iconic than GW2 armor.  However, they designed armor based on a very different system, making them explore profession themes more thoroughly, building beautiful nuances between armor sets.  Not everything was a masterpiece but some really great designs came out of it.
---
There's clearly still love for GW1 and ANet put so much work into it.  There's no shame in pulling from old ideas. It's there for the taking, ready to fill in style niches that have otherwise been missed.  But so far, we've only gotten a few styles ported over in six years.
---
&gt; would not work with non-human races well at all.
---
I guess that depends on your style. If you want to stick to cultural armor, then yeah, GW1 skins won't do you any good for any other race. But if you have enjoyed the [primeval dervish outfit](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Primeval_Dervish_Outfit), [krytan armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Krytan_armor), or any of the other GW1-inspired outfits on other races, then I think ANet will be able to make it work out nicely.

Wow, this turned out longer than expected. Uhh, I hope this offers some decent insight, whether or not it actually changed your mind.
---
We had  things like rune of elementalist going from 50s to about 4 gold. It was in meta for a week or so? So now that it's not "BiS" can it go back to 50s recipe? Of course not :P How about, say, Superior Sigil of Ogre Slaying? On what green Earth is it supposed to cost almost 3g to craft (with 11s TP cost). 
---
Why is cost in terms of piles of crystals and elements all over the place? There's no logical explanation how many symbols you need either. Air only needs one. Blight needs 2. Ogre slaying 3(!!). Balancing done by RNG squirrels?
---
Why is unlocking PvP rune costs 5g for whole set instead of 6x5 for whole set? Or more? And PvP gives same log in rewards and per match gold ;)
---
People were complaining that build experimenting is not happening and making every sneeze in meta 50g is supposed to somehow help with that?
---
Please add WvW or PvP in the title so they know which gamemodes you are talking about 
---
Ok! Oh one more question sorry! Im also interested in ele/revenant/necro whats the pros and cons? I used to main a ritualist and ele in the old gw if that helps at all lol
---
You are beautiful :)
---
The upgrade salvage thing is uninteresting to me, I got the permanent upgrade extractor. I pick upgrade out of loot before I salvage it anyway, so I'm more interested in the -30c -5% difference. I'd think that for non-upgrade salvage, mystic and silver-fed are still far superior.
---
Boobs
---
Correct!  
---
With a sigil of paralysation I believe the difference in defiance bar damage is 10, which is tiny and without the sigil hammer is more cc, so I think damage is a valid consideration.
---
Medium is 90% trenchcoats and ugly. Sure there's stuff like carapace or whatever, but those are in the minority.
---
I disagree. I think it is quite reasonable to craft things out of your own mats. I also think it is quite reasonable to not want to worry about your own mats but just buy them from the TP. And of course those who don't want to craft at all just sell any mats they happen to have on the TP for those who prefer to buy or those who prefer to gather their own mats but might be a bit short.
---
In other words: "play the way you want".
---
A condescending twat that was fucking right. Well damn. :D
---
Yeah, Medium armors are mostly trash. Way too many ugly trenchcoats with claws and stuff all over them. Nothing that looks particularly good on a character. My mains are still wearing some of the on 1-2 outfits that looked halfway decent at launch. 
---
Super friendly comment, thanks and have a nice day.
---
You are a bully
---
F2P can by salvage kits with gems ?!
---
you are right i forgot about Orr. It have a lot of events in the water on all maps. If you have not plewed through the water content in Orr this is probably the best of them all.
---
Yup.
---
Haha the last sentense is so true :D Their aggro range is sometimes ridiculous.
---
Tell that to the guys I bonked with it in wvw. 
---
So um not gonna lie, if your laptop is a potatoe laptop you will have big issues in WvW. Maybe not so much just by walking around and fighting a person here and there or take a sentry or a camp, but if you want to join the large fights, you will need something that can handle 70v70v70 fights in a small area like for example in a lord room. 
---
The frames fucking TANK during WvW. If you got a 50vs50vs50 threeway going on your laptop will melt through the earth's crust.
---
If you play it on lowest details, it should kind of work somewhat-ish.

https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/230165307-Guild-Wars-2-Account-Types-Free-Core-HoT-PoF
---
Free lacks the expansion content (duh) and has restrictions regarding trading post, chat and some major cities that will need you to reach lvl35 or something. To combat gold sellers and botters and whatnot. But that's it. The rest is completely free, the entire core game like the rest of us veterans have played for years. No hooks, no money milking.
---
Cute!  I love the yellow

I mean the whole pale tree and vision of past Orr set him up well enough for my charr

If you change your address to a us one, it will allow you to buy the codes and use them.

I mean, in all fairness, when GW2 released, its armor sets were more intricate and beautiful than any MMO previously released.  You had more ability to customize, dye, mix and match, which afforded you the ability to make yourself look cooler while *leveling* than in *end game* raiding WoW.  I think that still stands, for the most part.  (To be fair, I haven't played many MMOs that have newly released in the last 4 years.)  
---
But I agree that GW2 could certainly do a better job at releasing more armor designs as part of the natural game progression with each expansion, instead of in the gem shop.  I think a big part of this missing feature is the abandonment of new dungeons as a game mode.  In vanilla GW2, the most badass armor sets were obtained from the individual dungeon currencies. Dungeons were challenging, and unlocking the full sets for all 3 armor types was basically an end-game progression track.  Years later and those are still the only such armor sets. 
---
thx fr th mmrs! &lt;3
---
Good old days. I haven't seen this for so long. I guess nowadays this video miss some things like fractals but it's still relevant.
---
mean
---
Leggins have 73 different skins. All others have even more variety. Doesn't this mean you have more than 6^73 possible combinations. So if fashion would be randomised it would be (statistically) impossible to have 2 Characters withthe same Outfit even if everyone in the world has a gw2 account with max characters
---
Shoulders, there could be amazing freaking shoulders and yet 98% are just meh, if that. I don't get why this is the case, shoulders can be anything and yet they stuck on meh.
---
And boots for asura. There are like 10? Probably not even that, boots with room for all toes. And pants for asura and boots that don't looks like slipperboots. Argh! And why must all asura armor have skirts even when all other races do not have that on their pants. Omg i feel how my heart is raising, this is a seriouse topic!!!! 
---
Gief good looking gear for asura!
---
Sure! I’d love to see more 
---
The local decoration cap seriously curtails any creativity.
---
I was in the exact same situation as you. I created a new Mesmer and leveled it to 80 since I had totally forgotten how to play it. I also deleted my old Mesmer, but don't do that. I miss it.
---
"but muh silhouette!" Anet says as they release another outfit in the gem store that any class can wear.  
---
People shit on medium the most because it is by far the worst offender when it comes to lack of variety. You get to pick between a trenchcoat, trenchcoat, trenchcoat, trenchcoat, and trenchcoat. Then, to add salt to the wound they made the legendary chest piece a trenchcoat in disguise.  
---
Iv been trying to buy the standard collection and it's also giving me a error.
---
Which server to pick? Im into raids fractals and pvp, english speaking
---
Would u mind giving comment on https://www.reddit.com/r/GuildWars2Builds/comments/abjhqi/revenant_roaming_build_opinions/?st=JQEEH8YV&amp;sh=1c17df64.
---
I really like rev lately since war died but feels like vent is new mirage , what u think ? 
---
And for guide if u could add why chose traits over others would help a lot to see ur reasons and compare :)
---
well I have none yet but I may be into wvw in future, Ill pick some high pop one, thanks for the answer :)
---
If your motivational tumblr posts haven't helped you, it's weird to try them on me. 
---
&gt;Information taken from various sources relying on leaked technical documents.
---
LOL
---
I don't understand 'scholary look for heavy armor class','bulk up armor with light armor class'. Can you show some examples? I've never seen this so i can't imagine what it looks like
---
Verificaste los drivers?
---
I agree with the other commentor, the yellow makes it totally draw your eye and gives it a great atmosphere!
---
Eli5 "Rage Is Sage". I want to read some drama.
---
I haven't played him in a hot minute, but I don't believe the Sylvari racial armor coat clips weapons. 
---
Oo ok thanks alot for all the info :)!
---
Thank you so much for the comment :) 
---
No.  They're tied to achievements, and the upgraded set costs a decent amount to get.
---
Wouldn't call this an unpopular opinion. Most of the characters I play are charr and I've run out of good fashion options for them on all armor weights because I'm tired of using the same pieces over and over because the others either just look bad on charr or have bizarre clipping.
---
It isn't even tail clipping that bothers me. It's much worse when your waist just gets cut in half and there's a small gap in it, or your character's neck just disconnects from your armor. This isn't exclusive to charr, either, it is just much more noticeable on them because of their unique body type. I've seen it on every race but asura, but I don't play them or look at them enough to notice.
