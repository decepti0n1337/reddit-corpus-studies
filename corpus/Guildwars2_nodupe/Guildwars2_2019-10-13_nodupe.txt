Please elaborate what you mean
---
Doubt it but PvE armor only takes 6 weeks min (for first set, 12 after that) and PvP takes 3 seasons (which is more than 3 months, usually more around 5-6).
---
Everyone should be X + DPS, so there would be no "DPS main".  
---
Tank + DPS, Heal + DPS, Support + DPS, Control + DPS, ...
---
Scrapper doesn't, in PvE it can kite (keep damaging mechanics away from group and tank them) and in WvW it runs as a healer converting conditions to boons. So if you were able to cleanse conditions you can convert them to boons but you don't really give boons on meta builds otherwise (yes flasks are a thing but you have better skills to run)

What is the most direct path to get the dragon flying mount when you've just expanded to HoT/PoF? It seems like I must be missing something about how to get the flying dragons that everyone seems to be flitting about on.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Skyscale
---

---
Info of how to get it is all in that link. For most it’s more of a long term goal, not something you can get right away.
---
I pugged every fractal I ever did. I always ran arc and made sure to quit/flame low dps groups. I have a LOT of experience with what you describe. You're full of shit.
---
No one ever gets kicked because he's last dps, 99% of the time if you get kicked because your dps is low it's because it's nearing 50-40% of what others are doing. No amount of using CC or anything will make you fall that low.
---
Not saying fractals can't be toxic, just saying that going in saying "well, I have no idea how to hit the boss, but I do every mechanic" will and should get you kicked if you join as dps

I'm playing ff14 atm waiting for the next gw2 update (going to prog the new upcoming ultimate raid :D). But the wiki/any source of information is spread out to about 3-5 websites between gathering/crafting, item information, stats information, where to get certain items, builds, and raid boss information. These are all separate in their own sites. I miss the gw2 wiki all in one package. You guys rule.
---
Uncategorized seems to be an alternate Tyria that was destroyed.  
---
The crazed asura likely tried to save his city by teleporting part of it away, and ended up stranded in the air somewhere, everyone else died, and loneliness turned him into a crazy person with cat golem pets.
---
Well then you'll have to make your question more specific. Like which mode are you interested in supporting in? Which level of gameplay are you at; casual or hardcore? Do you have access to all the stat combinations? Is there any class you have a preference for? 
---
Some people would tell you class X is the "best" for game mode Y. But "best" is subjective, for sure. Like Firebrand and Renegade are really good at supporting raids and fractals right now **IF** how you define "best" as finishing a boss as quickly as possible.
---
My point is just about every class and elite spec is good at supporting in some way in at least one game mode. Berserker is good at might support in raids/fractals. Spellbreaker is good at boon rip support in WvW. Tempest is good at healing and aura/boon support in multiple modes. Chronomancer is good at boon support and tanking in raids and fractals. Etc. etc. etc.
---
Awesome!

The dead guy who you might have been thinking of is George Coe, who voiced Captain Weyandt, other ghostly pirates, a lot of dredge, and others

That hair part will probably never happen, they would need to redo every head skin and fitting them onto every hair option

How about in Open World and PVP?
---
Oh, you are still trying? How sad.
---
Tal como dice Astraliguss, estamos demasiado lejos de la versiòn en inglés. Si hay más interesados se podria ir haciendo a la par.
---
I am not sure if anyone is going to top the Stance revenants use to get out of his jail. The channeling the Legendary prisoner was pure gold
---
I haven't played SPvP in a long long time so I can't really help you there, beyond saying whatever you have the most fun on will be "best" for you. 
---
In open world everything works. Maybe focus on something that can break bars if you're looking to do the map-wide meta events. Or a healer/condition remover.
---
qfb runs full berserker gear. if you have dgh you have qfb

complexity refers to the 10 point list the parent comment posted
---
though for you I suppose I'd add reading comprehension to the list :V
---
I'm always nervous playing in pugs because I don't have all the mechanics memorized and I'm soo afraid I'll piss people off if I make mistakes. All these comments just confirmed my fears 😣
---
Bonus points. Use the aviator tonic to T pose
---
stop playing healbrand, if you need to be carried that bad, let rene heal
---
Care to drop some logs from those dh runs?
---
Literally 4 of them are legit full meta and the rest are absolutely viable.  Please learn something about the game before commenting
---
lol
---
I used to do druid a lot in T4's back when it was meta. I very rarely had someone complain and it was usually about maintaining power. You just gotta be confident and know when to stand your ground. If someone talks down on you too much, just tell them to leave if they don't like it. Usually they'll leave and dps is easy to replace. Never give in to the shit-talkers.
---
U need to have an axe tho, it's not much of a dps difference, but you have that fury symbol
---
it depends on other factors if you need axe. do you have slb, did he precast moa stance and red moa fury, are your phases short, is warrior running fgj, do you have a guard, do you have a weaver, all that.
---
Remember Gwen and Althea
---
YIKES
---
Did you check logs? Did you make more or less the dps expected of fractal chrono and provided acceptable boon uptime?
---
Sounds like your guild just needs more people to show up for the unlocking run. When my guild unlocked Windswept Haven not long after PoF came out, we had about 15 people I think and it wasn't difficult considering we went in blind. Got it in the first shot.

request if it can be done for the t1-t6 . instead of the  raw [Crafting materials](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Crafting_material) showing what bags they come from, would it be possible to show what mobs to look for instead please? ie; instead of  [Gossamer Scap](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gossamer_Scrap#Contained_in) being shown the bags, chests, etc,  instead it shows [who they're dropped by](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bag_of_Alchemical_Materials#Dropped_by) and zone or instance they're in instead?
---
I don't like the combo heal + dps. In ff14 you need to do exactly that and then some ppl flame the healer that he did not enough damage. I never touched healer again after that.

You mean literally EVERY SINGLE PUG?

ANSWER: Everything
---
1. Zosin is right. Condi is one of the hardest rotations in the game, because Weave Self grants boons for each attunement, and then re-grants all those boons on fourth attunement, so you gotta space out your attunements just right. It's a very, very long rotation to memorize, and you don't get to see 75% of your cooldowns at a given time.
---
2. Fresh Air Power is so much better for overworld. Yeah, Condi Weaver has considerable burst damage, but Fresh Air Power has CC and good emergency heals. Both builds are very fragile though, I wouldn't recommend them without a healer or mounts for HoT/FotM.
---
3. The Raid dps builds are actually Sword/Focus and Dagger/Focus. Dagger has dashes, which makes the build frustrating for healers and anyone trying to grant Quickness and Alacrity. Focus is all for Fire/Fire.
---
4. Viper has to be crafted. It just sucks. Good luck.
---
This comments are from toxic players. Really its not like that!
---
If you are new just join a team, say hello, and ask for help... Most people will help!!!!
---
INB4 legendary bags...
---
So for things item acquisition, we rely heavily on automation -- if you [take a look at the source code for Gossamer Scrap](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/index.php?title=Gossamer_Scrap&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1) for example you'll see we don't write out every bag or salvage item it drops from, we just use a template like `{{contained in}}`, which automatically scours the rest of the wiki for container items that list "Gossamer Scrap" as one of their contents.
---
While this saves us a lot of time, the downside is of course that it's hard to implement new ways of displaying the information. Displaying mobs and general zones where these containers can be found could probably be done, but doing it in a way that doesn't horribly bloat the page and make it slow to load is another question entirely. We're always open to suggestions for improvement, though, and we'd welcome input from anyone who has ideas on how to solve this problem.
---
The [Community portal](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_2_Wiki:Community_portal) and our [discord server](https://discord.gg/C4RMwPN) are two good places to start a discussion like this. :)

HB + Alacren makes PUG runs way easier than the other way around, thats why its PUG META. Noone likes healing ren, and noone likes running 0heals.

Hey guys I just bought the two expansions after being away from the game for 5 years I think. I stopped playing a bit after they announced it was going f2p. 
---
I was wondering if there’s any guide for returning players? I have a lvl80 thief so should I just go do the HoT content? 
---
Also are there any major gameplay changes I should be aware of? 
---
Tysm!
---
Yeah, literally EVERYONE is wrong, good thing you come here to show us the light.
---
By the way... have you ever opened the LFG? Have you seen literally every single team asking for HB+Alacren?
---
* I'm assuming you mean our user pages? Like [my user page](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Greener)? It's really whatever you'd like them to be, within reason. Some people like to show off their characters, others use them to keep organized.
---
* They're as permanent as you'd like them to be. They'd only be deleted if they crossed obvious boundaries of decency (e.g. hateful content; copyright infringements, etc.)
---
* I'm not sure what joke you're talking about.
---
* Zoology is not my strong point, sorry.
---
&gt;same goes for the people who dont understand english when you ask them to use the beacon to teleport, yet they refuse to do so and dont even reply.
---
I also hate it when people don't understand other languages other than English and don't reply to me and don't even reply. ^(/s)
---
Warrior, Ranger, Thief, Necro, Guardian.
---
Warrior and Guardian are just spamming things on cooldown.
---
So is Ranger, but more importantly Ranger and Necro have minions which take aggro off you.
---
Thief has one best button at a given time, which you'll spam.
---
Engineer and Elementalist require a lot of buttons for the same results. Mesmers are just weird. Revenants are like playing GW2 upside-down. These four classes are fun, and honestly, most GW2 classes can be learned easily on the path to level 80, provided you don't use boosters and are willing to try all your weapons, skills, and builds. But these four have the potential to seem overwhelming, perform underwhelming, or teach bad habits.
---
[Rain](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Rainspell) here. I think my most memorable project has been reducing orphan pages. Logging on for an hour or two a night to reconnect or eliminate isolated pages really made me feel like my contributions meant something. :)
---
My proudest project is the WvW page though. It was a rather neglected page, and me and several others have rewritten it several times as patches hit, but there is no part of that guide I haven't rewritten, rephrased, or updated.
---
The most fun thing to document is either jumping puzzles or "bounty hunting" missing images/images that need improvement/verification requests. It's absolutely hilarious to drag my guildies into an event chain that hasn't been completed in years in a map they haven't visited in months to get 3 lines of dialogue, then tell them why.
---
&gt;I was wondering if there’s any guide for returning players?
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/guildwars2/wiki/returningplayers 
---
&gt; I have a lvl80 thief so should I just go do the HoT content? 
---
Make sure you're geared up first, or you're in for a bad time. Some people also suggest doing the first mission of PoF first instead because that gives you the first mount
---
&gt;Also are there any major gameplay changes I should be aware of? 
---
Not really, game play is largely the same, just balance has changed some mechanics around
---
In my opinion you should not become overly attached to any one class in this game. Anet cannot be relied upon to balance the game whatsoever so you mostly have to choose a class based on the role you want to play and which classes are OP at the moment.
---
Check out metabattle or godsofpvp and pick a build for your role. If you want to be a 1v1 beast there are classes like spellbreaker that are good at it, but if you want high speed and high damage to run around ganking people you're better off with a thief. If you want to heal, you go firebrand, etc.
---
If you are a PvP oriented player I would generally advise you against trying this game. There's no harm in it but I find the state of PvP right now to be very poor and it gets little support from Anet.
---
If it wasn't soulbound, people would endless create alts to get multiples of them. So, yes it is.
---
I think it would also be cool to take that idea further and do a "post apocalypse" setting for that uprizing. I'm thinkin future in chrono trigger.
---
Yea no. I know this commander and play with him pretty often for strike. He would never be a dick. Especially to noobies unless they were intentionally being stupid and it annoyed him :T
---
Of course I'm not one of the biggies of the krewe but I wanted to add to it as well.
---
I can't recall about any memorable stuff, maybe some oopsies and gotchas with pretty dumb mistakes I had back when I started helping, that I only came to realize about when helpful people brought them up in my Talk page. I have them archived there for history \^\^
---
I could say I'm proud of a revamp of [Level rewards](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Level_rewards) article, that was my first real big take on editing (before I just helped with typos and stuff here and there). My original idea is still used there for this day although others have improved it. That's an example of how the collaborative effort makes it better. 
---
Another one is a recent little revamp of [Special event](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Special_event) article, that even came from a merge with the "now defunct" Bonus event article. That one was my first big take on templates and that became the base for the current improved version. Oh and I'm proud to be part of this (even with a tiny participation) with these great people that makes all these impressive works to keep it great :).
---
Most fun: hmm nothing specific, I just have fun helping and learning from it, and also with "racing" to be the first to create patch notes articles. :D
---
love you noxxi &lt;3 thanks for all the great laughs.
---
&gt; ...however playing fractal with pugs means the others will have some stupid dps meter and rage if the dps is slightly too low, including if you're 1k below the other guy who didn't save a cc skill or whatever.
---
In the last 2 years of running fractals nearly every day I have seen this happen once. It wasnt a pug, it was a newbie trashing on our necro saying they cant dps (was out dps'd the whole time by them). If you want to get back into fractals look for more experienced meta-ish groups that want that safe consistent clear.
---
[removed]
---
I wonder if this is the same comm I merged my group with to fill faster. They didn't want to start the jp until we got 10 in squad and in the instance.
---
sad
---
Dont dish it out if you cant take it
---
If you are trying to fake your way and skate by while letting the rest of the party carry you, yea there will be some shade thrown your way. Be upfront and ask if you need help or a refresher on fight mechanics. Players are way more understanding and ready to dish out help/advice when they know you are new and asking for help goes along way to getting better at the fights and shit.
---
The mission prevents new people from joining only in public. This was a squad so you can solo the jp and open up lfg if you'd wanted to.
---
It’s on the table™
---
It’s “on the table™”
---
just dont bring kalla
---
when you have to boonstrip as rev the fb  brings stability, obviously
---
it's nice if they do it if they carry a focus around but otherwise it's really not their job at all
---
He probably wanted the bonus chests; you can kill it with any amount of people obviously but having at least 8 people guarantees easy bonus loot. :)
---
Thank you for providing the other perspective to this... Always love seeing how true these Reddit stories actually are.  Sad to see the OP was so impatient.
---
You lose for making that joke!
---
Second best counts as decent imo. I am cheap after all.
---
Game is fine.  Playerbase is healthy.  The Flame Legion are our friends, but the Metal Legion is where everyone's at now.
---
do you have a higher res pic?
---
People salty on strike missions is really sad
---
Has nothing to do with bonus chests though. It's about saving time and unlocking the teleport.
---
Try Runes od Magic or Allods if you think Anet is milking ppl.
---
The problem is, if people are going on ahead and unlocking the waypoint then it's almost guaranteed someone impatient is gonna start the fight and attack the boss.  Wanting to be considerate of the other people still joining shouldn't be something they're chastised over especially since it's really only a few minutes difference anyway.
---
holy shit you just made this account today, damn man you must really love this comm. Have fun with him, seems to quite the character.
---
I love that turtle.
---
Crazen, they're monkeys dude, ignore them lol
---
I would've been a lost noob for even longer than I was if it weren't for those timers. I'm truly grateful for them.
---
That's so sweet.
---
what price would be ok for you?
---
That would explain why your heals are shit.  That's at least 20% outgoing healing you're giving up.
---
And my experience is completely different. After the daily fractals I tag up with 3-4 people in squad and open up lfg for few more to join. While waiting on lfg we pre-clear the jp. 
---
None of the pugs that join have started the mission on their own. We've been doing this pretty much daily since the ep got released. 
---
And to continue from my first comment; the commander kicked us that went ahead to do the jp. 
---
Afterwards we opened our own squad on lfg and added in the description that we are at the boss. Squad was 8/10 and guess who were the last 2 to join. :) The other commander and the person in their squad that comm dragged with them when merging. 
---
So for someone who didn't want impatient people (I assume) and was quick to pull the trigger on the kick, they sure as hell joined our almost full at the boss squad really fast.
---
Is that new? I don't think I've ever noticed that feature before. It's great though. You guys should do a top 10 list post of useful features for noobs.
---
Personally it won't affect me in PVE. I usually go with "Reformed Mirage Mirror" and "Evasive Mirror". I'll go for a distortion, form 3 mirrors, use Mirror images, then dodge to make a 3rd clone. Then run into each mirror. Because of this usually all the aggro will be on me rather than my clones. I don't really think the impact on PvE mesmers would matter all that much since you don't solo as much. Although it might matter more to mirages that use axes or don't shatter.
---
To be more specific, the shock came from comparing the 974g price tag (discount included), to the 800g full price that armor sets (like the [Aetherblade Armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Aetherblade_armor) for example, not outfits) used to cost.
---
I see what you're saying though, I understand the *why* it happens, I guess this was more a reactionary post haha, it just really took me the surprise how far things have come.
---
Charr are just bigger hairier Asura, with weird looking heads, and clipping issues
---
Don’t pug this stuff, man. I’d rather low-man the strike mission with friends and guildies than do this with random strangers. I was in a 4-person squad and we killed the boss fast enough to spawn all three chests. No need for drama.
---
Hmmm... I will give you that some of them are more flashy yes (which apparently is all that matters nowdays in Fashion Wars), but when you start saying that the older ones were "bland, hardly detailed, not much better than random leveling armor skins", you are making a bold claim, that is ultimately more opinion than fact. 
---
Take the Viper or the Trickster's armor sets for example. Whether you like them or not,  both of those are brand new models that while maybe not flashy, I would argue contain a high level of detail and variety of textures and surfaces. You can compare the gloves of either of those and compare it to the Chaos or Pyre gloves which, while flashy, are essentially just particle effects placed on top the character's model. 
---
In the end, it comes down to the individual's opinion on whether they think any cosmetic better/worse than another, and whether it is worth the price, but there's no denying prices have spiked.
---
I would say the metaphor is more like comparing $5 bundle of apples in one store vs the same apples sold individually for $2.75 at a different store, just because they know people will pay for them.
---
I've installed the latest version from the website and textures seem take about a minute for each new map to load is this normal? I extracted the zip file in the gw2 folder and overwrote the other. Followed by  installing the chainload file.
---
What's the dulfy wall and what's the story of how it got that name?
---
Urban fractal, the gate with the champion unit Dulfy in front of it
---
It’s a bit variable with the way the stitcher put things together, yeah—I should have overlapped the images more.
---
From the perspective of an axe/x mirage in PvE, this would hurt the build. The main reason you want Infinite Horizon on that build is not for the durability of the illusions (though that can be handy), but for your clones to spam Imaginary Axes with you. 
---
No mirage cloak on clones would mean no imaginary axes from them, resulting in a dps loss. How much of the total dps, I'm not sure, but with 3 clones up that's about half of the damage from using Mirage Cloak gone.
---
Mirage is broken ~~in pve~~, better nerf holo.
---
Ftfy
---
Since you already have the gauntlets through a pvp track that step is complete for you! I’ve unlocked several steps between aurora and vision through pvp tracks. It is really convenient if you would prefer pvping instead of completing map achievements. Just make sure the pvp track awards the item you need for the collection per zone.
---
Good Luck!
---
Support scrapper too.
---
I am enjoying these request submissions for Halloween being posted 3 days before it is released.
---
You mean to say don't bring soulcleave summit?  Literally the backbone of the fractal comp and basically the only reason that running without a healer is viable in pugs. Soulcleave summit, that skill which very significantly increases total group dps by adding a metric tonne of life steal and maintains scholar uptime.
---
Are you sure that's what you meant?
---
Don't listen to him! When you click the links, it takes you to PvP mATs!
---
Thanks for your detailed input! Level 80 gear sounds great and I‘ll see if can get my hands on them.
---
The named armor pieces really are your best bet and you can run exotic armor all the way up to the start of tier 4 fractals and in raids no problem. The guide I linked goes over everything in detail too. If you want any help gearing up, figuring out builds, or getting hero points let me know too.
---
You are making a rather big mistake here though: You base your whole argument around how much it would cost in gold, which is irrelevant to the pricing. The pricing takes the direct cost of gems (for real life currency) into consideration, not the in-game earnable currency.
---
Are you claiming you didn't write this?  LOL.

This triggers me nearly as much as warriors refusing to use mace mace instead of USELESS GS, like come the fuck on, you don't even loose dps but you gain huge amount of cc, I add every gs loving no cc warrior to my block list.
---
Consumables were there way before than lounges I suppose so their prices were actually fair back in time. After the lounges became mainstream, Anet simply didn't change the cost of the consumables so with this perspective, it shouldn't surprise anyone that they have high prices still.
---
Tbf healers do have a minimum damage they should hit in raids otherwise it can be a drain, especially if dps is slacking (which happens more than it should in pugs).
---
Then again, we're on week 11 for raids and I still run into people of all roles who can't clear the first boss in three tries let alone one despite having at least one clear on their character.
---
What are you saying? Dont you know SuPpOrT GoOd DPS BaD, DPS ArE cHiLdREn
---
I think this is the most correct answer right here.
---
Having a set without a lot of details/flashy bits across all three weights: 800x3 = 2400gems. 
---
Foefire-Set = 1500gems (undiscounted) for an intricate 'half'-set across all three weights.
---
I think that's pretty ok.

It's the entrance to raids after all - gotta come with all features ;v

---
Actually supports are only there to provide utility and boons, their dps is very irrelevant, anyone who blames the supports for running minstrel and doing 2k dps is a toxic elitist /s
---
Copy game folder somewhere else, uninstall GW, install it where You want, paste game files from previous installation.
---
Where does it install?
---
&gt; Back then anet said launchbuddy was fine as long as you didn't fully afk
---
The problem is most likely the different definition Anet and launchbuddy users have for being afk/playing actively.
---
While players think its fine to rotate between, lets say 3 different clients and 3 alts, if you put in all commands manually for each character, Anet sees tabbing out of one client to tab into another as not actively playing the first client anymore. And if that character on the first client is in a scenario where it earns rewards, for example auto-attacking a world boss, its not allowed.
---
&gt; for example auto-attacking a world boss, its not allowed.
---
half of the community should be banned then
---
No. I just call bullshit to your claim that you're just as good as people who follow rotations nearly perfectly (good players) when tapping random buttons.

hi, 
---
i just got my first ban from guild wars 2. do they usually send you an email stating the reasons why? 
---
second somewhat related question : do bans start from 1 week?
---
hi im not streaming until now (maybe that change at some point) but i have ayoutube channel with a lot of guides abotu mesmer and general game mechnaics. maybe you liek soem stuff:

---
Wasn’t what they said something like „one command one action „ ?
---
&gt; half of the community should be banned then
---
those players just use a single client and earn a single event reward.
---
The problem is multiboxers using multiple clients at the same time to earn rewards while not actively playing them.
---
thats for macros

nobody would buy banker golems even if they lasted longer because people don't want to waste much money on limited time items.
---
dont worry about their forums they remove 90 % of everything which isnt all about meaningless fluff, rainbows and worshiping them
---
The problem there lies in the fact that i can also afk at bosses, and only at the last second tag in and get full rewards, i see it all the time. 
---
So, if i afk on my main account its allowed, but if i were to autoattack on an alt (and thusly actually DO something) its not allowed?
---
Sounds a little backwards
---
Don't post on the official forums.
---
Now that’s quality links right there
---
*plays Terminator theme*
---
Why not just go public instead if ppl not willing to listen to a commander? Mean anyone can set up a squad. Don’t se a problem here, if commander said from start let’s wait, then do so. Else just find a other tag or make own squad.
---
That's common and the reason why I'm just read here and figure out that stuff with the updates on a google-spreadsheet with two supporting guild mates.
---
Any discussion about these things were just downvoted, so I stopped trying.
---
yeah, it's so bad. do you remember 4 necro 1 druid comps on lfg? thats the level of bad trends we're dealing with here.
---
That important detail is irrelevant to the story. If I wanted to lie or make the other party in question look bad I'd leave it out.
---
No one was rude, no one was toxic in the chat from either sides. We were 6 or 7 inside and someone said we're just doing the jp for the shrine port. Then the kicks followed. That's it. Simple as that. Happened within a minute or so.
---
There was no exact reason given out as to why we need to wait and why we can't save time and clear the jp.
---
Didn't think there are people out there like that. Reading your replies it seems to be more common than what I've experienced.
---
Just a few extras
---
1. I find it similar to power, it aint too bad IMO and for newcomers, no conjures is much easier.
---
2. Yea, pretty much but on moderate hp bosses condi weaver still has great 80% burst if your team don't know how to burst well.
---
3. Dual attacks are exactly the same and based on main hand weapon. Magnetic wave is also a 3 condi cleanse which is something s/d lacks as it would have to go into water offhand for cleansing wave, although fresh air shouldnt be as much trouble.
---
DPS loss is big if you dont perfect weave.
---

---
Just pm me on reddit tomorow i can add you in game, i have a guild with some casual people you could do rerolls with. I can introduce you to dongeons a d some lvl 80 content if you want to.
---
People are a bit toxic for the elite spec runs. If you want to just perma reroll just do it and have fun.
---
if you had to do actual work for rewards 95% of the playerbase wouldnt get a single worldboss :D
---
Don’t bother too much, this is a clear ‘’dps bad’’ circle jerk post. And all this rant about heal FB too, which is by far the easiest role of fractals. Particularly, the part about bringing CC consumable is kinda ridiculous: without them you kinda bring zero CC, when almost all DPS and renegade do. 
---
And all this considering the only IG rants about supports I’ve seen towards support players have been pretty obvious no stab FB, or no stripping/no staff CC Renegades, when you can actually see a lot of bad DPS called out with arc.
---
I'm interested in playing a Necromancer but I have absolutely no interest in minions/summons.  
---
I found this build [Scourge - Scepter/Troch Epidemic](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Scourge_-_Scepter/Torch_Epidemic) which seemed like fun, but after reading a bit I found out that it's outdated. Is it still viable or are there similar builds? I'm mainly interested in (solo) open-world PvE.
---
Please calling freezie a  strike is an insult. It's way more engaging than the poor excuse of a thing they called a strike.
---
External?  As in USB/eSATA?
---
Wouln't recommend that unless you want to be waiting 5 minutes every time you change zone.
---
What’s worse - GW2 forums where things are heavily moderated or this GW2 reddit where you get downvoted into oblivion if you don’t have anything nice to say about someone’s art, first world completion, or anything else really?
---
Same goes for charr tank, it stays in inventory and won't turn into GH decor. It's sitting in my inventory for at least 2 weeks now.
---
It can be issues with the payment - not from yourselves, but the bank/card issuer.  Worth checking in with them as well, just see if something got a charge-back or if there was a problem with the payment going through.
---
It can also be issues with the game codes themselves, depending where you bought them from. There's some shady retailers with sketchy codes, and that can result in suspension.  
---
I'm not sure what the waiting times are at the moment for support, but issues like this do get fixed, as I believe it's kind of common - ArenaNet's systems seem very sensitive and the suspension will have been automatically triggered by that.
---
Mistlock still beats them all because it's the only one that will take you back from where you came if you use it again.
---
...You do realize that this shows 2 people not at the boss?
---
And that necro minions don't count?
---
Reason i stopped playing my chrono.
---
Fucking morons that can't even DPS properly and drop like flies complaining about not having alacrity for 2 seconds.
---
Well, my Laptop has shit for storage, also it's on a proper hard drive not a usb
---
I had only good experiences. Reply within 24 hours. No lomg explaining, easy and fast solutions. But what did you do years without expansion?
---
That's fine then.
---
We bought it from the start up page. Our guess is that we bought both within 2/3 mins of eachother using the same credit card. 
---
But I will check with my bank and see it there was an issue there. 
---
Thanks 😊
---
That might be it. The same card used on two different accounts within minutes might trigger ArenaNet's security. Sucks that you have to wait to get your game back though!
---
alac rene only really has low dps if they keep up soulcleave which isn't a thing they should do with heal fb 
---
heal rene is 'better healing' but that doesn't matter when a heal fb's kit is more reliable for fractals, also it's not a conspiracy of bad players, instead of being judgemental at least make the basic effort of understanding why most players take the easy route instead of the route that requires significantly more investment to actually get better times with
---
&gt; I’m sorry, so it’s fine for someone to earn rewards without doing any actual work for them, and only becomes a problem when that same person earns double+ the reward?
---
Technically, both is against the ToS. Even if you use a single client, you are not allowed to afk and must be actively playing, while you are earning participation rewards of any kind.
---
However, the damage being done by this is negligible, since its only one account and as was already mentioned, is most likely common practice by the majority of the player base. Another main difference is that if you only do it on one account, you arent really gaining any more rewards than a player that is actively dpsing the world boss, while a multiboxer does.
---
&gt; If that’s what you meant, we need to treat the actual problem (afk “play” and event leeching) instead of targeting a completely different community that happens to have some crossover.
---
Well, as I said, the more clients a players uses, the higher the damage from their afk play. But feel free to open another discussion, if you think that single players doing afk play/leeching is a problem.
---
Yes, reaper could do that, but I still don't understand why you ask DPS player to do it while having firebrand in your group.
---
Totally getting one as well
---
a single player tabbing out while earning some event participation isnt as harmful as a multiboxer doing the same. Players actively fighting a world boss will also usually get more rewards as they will earn some from add-on mob kills, so there is a small trade-off, if you tab out during a world boss.
---
It was on anets end. I spoke with the bank and they told me the they had not cancelled the payment
---
Staff 3
---
And whats wrong with making the account today? :'D
---
Whats worrying is that all of this could have been avoided, yet you caused a problem, and then now you're complaining because someone is complaining about you causing a problem because you decided to come on here and complain about an issue that you started.
---
Classic internet
---
Agreed but a good healbrand carries hard. 
---
I definitely think the OP was discussing pug groups where your average player is less than good 😂
---
care to fetch the sauce then?
---
I wish so many people would stop playing healbrand QQ It's totally unnecessary for most of fractals QQ
---
IDK how it makes you a dick when you want everything to go according to plan.  
---
He was the party leader so he was in charge. Its like that IRL. If your boss tells you to do something, you do it or risk getting reprimanded
---
Do people like.....not have jobs and understand the consequences of not listening?
---
qfb doesn't have condi cleanse/regen mantra, has less aegis because of n shield, less might, less duration on all of its boons, doesn't use weighty terms (aegis/quickness/regen + condi cleanse applications are less frequent therefore), less swiftness (no staff 3), no blasts (staff 2), and doesn't have to play around its legends if it needs to burst heal players.
---
it is significantly easier to carry with heal fb than it is with heal ren, and it is also significantly easier to ensure players have aegis and stab almost all the time with heal fb than on qfb
---
it's not stupidity just because you don't approve of it. it is much more consistent than heal ren or without heal for most.
---
That sort of build is perfectly fine for open world. You can change it up to fit your own style of course, but the big change that hit scourge recently is in regards to its shades. You used to be able to have desert shroud affects around both you and your shades. Not it’s either or. 
---
It’s a nerf that was geared towards WvW zerg fights, but affected scourge everywhere. Don’t worry about it unless you simply don’t enjoy the build or want to get top DPS on certain raid bosses.
---
no, i dont, because i dont use launch buddy and I already read her comments. If you are interested in it, it should be pretty easy to find by searching dornsingers comments for keywords.
---
IIRC it was mentioned between 2-5 months ago.
---
I'm genuinely at a loss as to why pub strike exist. Your explanation only worsened my confusion. To me, squad strikes seem to be the superior pub strike. No need to idle in the instance, no way to fuck it up, you can just come and go as you please, nothing's locked ...
---
Strange.
---
To me, popping my tag and hopping in with a bunch of pugs with a squad that filled within &gt;5 minutes is public.
---
Maybe if it were an entire zone, it'd make a certain sense...
---
Trash mechanics, like the entire game.
---
Isnt the Crystal Dessert one Shit cause No Gemstone at the last Reward Box ? Only this lentils and recipies ?
---
From purely a "meta" standpoint, guardian has almost never been bad and right now is best in slot for power dps and support, and 2nd best (?) for condi dps. Guardian has a little bit of incidental support but the dps builds, particularly dragonhunter, are by no means "support oriented". Give guardian another shot imo
---
I might give a try, thanks.
---
&gt; First, what do you think is the BEST for pvp?   
---
There is no "best". It depends on who's controlling the character.  
---
&gt; My second question is what is most FUN for pvp? 
---
Entirely subjective.  
---
If PvP is your main aim to join GW2, i highly advice you to just skip the game. PvP is in a horrible state.
---
well, what do you mean by multitasking?
---
&gt;If you are a PvP oriented player I would generally advise you against trying this game. There's no harm in it but I find the state of PvP right now to be very poor and it gets little support from Anet.
---
I just replied something like this without realizing someone else might've dropped that bomb.  
---
I would like to correct you somewhat. "Little Support" is almost non existing support.  
---
Furthermore, balance isn't the game's only PvP issue. Bots, afk/idle players up to Gold tier make it extremely frustrating to get into platinum. And there you're faced with the unbalance and wintraders trying to take the top spots with alt accounts that randomly disconnect, afk or throw matches.   
---
I absolutely second the "Don't try this game" motive.
---
Keen as always, u/Retard_Goblin_Faggot

I've had close to a dozen tickets submit for varying issues, all of them resolved within 2-5 days. Their reply time really just depends on what's going on in the game, they only take a few extra days when a new story or map or large event open up because that causes a large influx of tickets. I do hope you get your issues resolved soon! Halloween is coming! 😱
---
Im not "just as good". Im a bit worse, and NO ONE CARES, because i do ENOUGH DPS and stuff dies within the usual times. 
---
Having 22, 24 or 26k at the end of the bossfight changes nothing in actual live runs, as opposed to the pro elite meta groups everyone here runs every day (and yet, i run every day and ive seen like... 2 LFGs for 0 heals in the last 6 months.
---
next time i run dps (i do that probably once a month so dont hold your breath) ill send you a screenshot of my arcdps (i don't know how to log the fights)
---
you can't sell the gift of battle
---
Please don't.  
---
I have yet to find a "mobile layout" that is better than a desktop layout, for use on mobile.
---
I completed the Aurora achi recently. I think its just enough if bosses are killed in different metas? The people I did it with didn't bother too much with CC either, but its very easy to kill one boss per meta.
---
Hello again =). I hope you didn't tired of art spam yet. My second drawing for Inktober 2019 (yes I'm slow) with one of my two mains — Norn Berseker by name Neryumo Umre.
---
Sorry, for me 'just as good' is a few k of difference. 
---
What kind of runs are you doing? 0/50/100/200kp+?
---
I LOVE your artstyle. I'd definitely be interested in a commission and pay with ingame gold, if you'd ever decide to do some. Keep it up!!!
---
&gt; most valuable reward track
---
Doesn't exist. Most valuable *to you* depends on what you want. If you like trying different builds, Crystal Desert Reward Track gives lots of gold and also a [Desert Armor Box](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Desert_Armor_Box). Having a dozen or so of those sitting in your bank makes it really quick and easy to equip a new build in just a few minutes.
---
Triumphant Armor Reward Track gives much less gold, but ends with a [Triumpant Armor Box](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Triumphant_Armor_Box) which gives Exotic armor that unlocks the Ascended versions of that armor.
---
Because a diviner chrono can deal acceptable damage, 
---
2k is not acceptable in decent pugs.
---
Except there's not enough depth to DPS role. That's why people default to it.
---
I love you too!

Well, some people have social anxiety issues about opening the LFG and joining parties.
---
Those can always enter the public version, wait and hopefully get it done eventually without having to talk with anyone.
---
I don't believe you get an email, no. When you log in you'll get a message saying "suspended for X time, for Y reason" where it's a vague non-specific reason. Most of the time people will go "oh yeah, I called that one guy [expletive here] that's probably why" and know exactly what they did. You can open a support ticket if you want to know more information. 
---
Suspensions can be as little as a few hours to 3 days for a first time offense, though they don't exactly make this information public. I've seen people who spam nonsense in wvw get timeouts for a few hours. A week is either something pretty severe for a first time offense or you're a frequent flier in the suspension system. 
---
But yeah, only a support ticket can get you the answer you seek. Though it may take 3-5 days for them to get back to you at the moment.
---
So play healing scourge in shaman gear, no way you can die (36k hp), if someone dies it's almost auto res, just ran and tank all stuff while using ur cooldowns.
---
[deleted]
---
That has got to be the most extra ultra niche use of a game feature that I've ever seen. :D
---
Ah well, we'll see. Part of me hopes that it's the test run for elite zones, having an open, public and an organized, closed version.
---
They may have to adjust the system down the line.
---
Just go there with scourge healer: they die they get ressed. 
---
It's better than staying there 30minutes coz noobs run all over the place.
---
He got his armor polished,
---
you mean putting them into the character for weekly key farm and deleting him\her instead?
---
I actually had that happen to me with my first account I created close to launch. I bought some gems to buy the molten alliance pickaxe when it was released and was banned a bit after. Unfortunately that account is still banned to this day and after 3-4 appeals, they told me it was their final decision and they wouldn't unban me even when I tried again last year. Thankfully I didn't have that much progress on the account aside from world exploration. But I hope you and your husband don't go through the same thing I did.
---
People flamed the healer because they \*wouldn't\* do DPS, usually out of some idea that "I'm the healer, I don't need to DPS" and instead spending about half their time completely wasted on overhealing.
---
OP said pugs. And if he gets matched up with 3 dps as depicted in the art, they most def need a healbrand
---
just look at blizzard right now. they decided to act upon a rule blitzchung agreed to as per his contract. that doesn't mean the rule is reasonable, or that blizzard doesn't have to expect any reaction or consequences themselves.
---
in this case the comm acted ignorantly, and after being informed of that he acted as a stubborn child would instead of reflecting on the situation. he's a great example of a toxic casual, and that's that.
---
Only the very first you'd get along with the Tome, Chalice and Mini was account bound. After that it's soulbound only.  
---
Though mind this was through Collector's Edition for me, but should be the same.
---
The disnonour timeouts shouldn't count to suspensions, I don't think.. It was probably just the choice words. I know a lot of gaming companies are cracking down on people using bad language with long time-outs, I guess ANet's just following the trend. 
---
I don't think they were necessarily a GM, I've seen multiple times people get time-outs in WvW within 20 mins of them being mouthy little things. I guess it's just if a GM is tackling some low-hanging fruit, so to speak, in the report queue. It's a very easy thing for them to tackle / act on.
---
Stop recycling the same picture.  No creativity.  Sigh

did you buy the recipes from the vendor or tried to discover them first?
---
Bright side. Both of you get to enjoy the whole content of the game!
---
Thanks. I also found a map in the meantime and that showed all 5 plants. I didn't find the spot on the eastern part of the map.
---
Yeaaah that ridiculously cute outfit is not what she wears at usual but I couldn't resist XD.
---
I think the point is, even as a healer, there's some small ammount of dps you can do. It won't compare to a DPS's numbers, but every bit helps.
---
This of course can be disregarded in high pressure encounters or if shit starts going sideways.
---
Thank you! Yeah I have but it's mostly personal and also full or my native language but here @neryumo

Thank you =)

Yeah, for a lot of them the filter really doesn't do it.

I don't really believe condi mesmer stil requires nerfs after last few patches. At best a few tone downs here and there for advanced players.
---
I have no idea what the OP is playing, but in the perspective of someone that usually plays classes risilient to condi the current state of mesmer is waaaay weaker to some patches ago.
---
It's not off the table...... about the best non-answer we could get.
---
Nice and neat picture, cheers to the artist.
---
They have confirmed that they are still working on Fractals, but the dev who was lead designer on Nightmare and Shattered Observatory has sadly left Anet.
---
Close to, imo. Social Awkwardness needs some work and interaction between stuff like outflanked and aoe's...
---
As a Russian GW player , i feel really good seeing stuff like this. I am totally fine with the game being in english , but i think support for cyrillic alphabet would be nice , not only for us , but for people from other cyrillic using countries - Bulgaria , Montenegro , Serbia and so on. 
---
I actually remember dev's position on GW2 translated to russian with a russian client , and they were pretty anti-russian on that regard. Dunno what this will turn into.
---
&gt;And if that character on the first client is in a scenario where it earns rewards, for example auto-attacking a world boss, its not allowed.
---
Nonsense. What you remember is about auto-casting abilities to afk-farm not counting as self input, which also was changed later as you can see from multiple afk farmers not being banned as long as there is no 3rd party tool involved except in the case of bothering other players. (Like in Halloween maze, where you "ruin" it for others by doing it.)
---
Love Peace Cyrillic!
---
It is not very likely they will ever release another CM fractal, at least not one akin to these two (which are awesome, yes). The player involvement with these two is even lower than raids, sadly.
---
No, but I don't follow meta either.
---
Copy&amp;paste &lt;insert speedclear guild&gt; build and rotation is what usually happens among pugs.
---
That would be totally cool to play as either nightmare court or even &gt;!Mordrem Guard Sylvari!&lt;
---
imagine fractal where we are on the airship fleet approaching mordremoth and sylvari get the call. we only saw this in a cinematic, but would be cool to experience first hand, and easy for anet to produce since they have all the Pact/HoT assets lying around

Having worked in support for a big gaming company for 10 years my guess is that you triggered some kind of fraud prevention system.

This is usually pretty easy to solve if an actual human being looks at the account and my guess is that they will whitelist your card for the transactions and unlock the account.

Lol, no. They're being quiet hoping that everyone will give up and go away. Standard ANet strategy.
---
A job well done. Hope for the best
---
where do you get that power quickbrand? i have literally seen ONE lfg for 0heal comp in the last 300 ess.
---
While 6-8 months is no doubt an exaggeration, they do occasionally add content to the festivals. Last year, Halloween got a return of Reaper's Rumble (which was bugged out by spaghetti code since 2012) and the beetle race. Wintersday got a new ~~raid~~strike.
---
They **do** add new content now and then.
---
Best time to have asked for something would have been just after Four Winds, since that's when they'd have been working on Halloween for sure.
---
&gt;No, that would be a pretty heavy spoiler for every new player that just bought the game (which isn't unlikely, considering the recent DLC changes).
---
So is the quest to find Joko-related stuff to act as "victory tokens" to fool Thorn into thinking Joko's alive.
---
Just lock it behind completing Long Live the Lich.
---
But then again, ArenaNet massively spoils **everything** that has occurred with their update notes. To them, it seems to be a case of "2 months old is free reign".
---
Directly from support ticket i had on this topic. From a senior GM. You are fine.
---
Sometimes i think misinformation really should be bannable on this sub.
---
Despite the downvotes, you may have a point. These may be aimed solely at people who routinely convert money to gems and buy these for convenience. As a convenience item, and viewed solely in dollar (euro, whatever) cost, they're fairly reasonable. Oddly, if looked at from a game time spent to buy though, they're horribly expensive. This is because the average player generates about $1/hour at best while playing the game.
---
As priced, they're not something that people would ever convert gold to gems for, and if they're made cheaper, it might inflate the gold/gem ratio. I'm assuming that Anet is fairly pleased with the current level of inflation, so the pricing may make some perverse sense given your scenario. It'd also introduce more gems into the economy, which actually is deflationary.
---
Of course since we don't have numbers, everything is speculation. But that's what this sub is for I guess.
---
Just because of RNG drop.
---
I agree with Gemini - that strike mission from BbB is awful. Did it once, never again.

It was the best event I participated. Well done, INOY!

Which skin? I can hardly see your character.
---
800/6 is 133 gems per armor piece for the aetherblade armors. 
---
The foefire pieces sold separately are 500/3=166 per armor piece.
---
The pack will then be: 974/3*3=108,22 per armor piece.
---
Now, if we objectively consider the actually usefulness of every piece:
---
* Aetherblade: 
---
 * Heavy pants on female as one of the few sets with no buttcape.
---
 * Medium shoulders look nice on engineers.
---
 * Light skirt can be put in some nice outfits.
---
 * All other pieces are useless. 
---
* Foefire: 
---
 * Shoulders have freaking candles.
---
 * Feet are sandals.
---
 * Gloves look ugly alone as they don't match any other sets other than foefire, but the other pieces can't be used because their own respective faults, making this piece also useless. 
---
That leaves 3 useful pieces out of 18 for aetherblade, and 0 useful pieces out of 9 for foefire. 
---
That means 800 gems per piece for aetherblade, and 974 for no pieces for foefire. 
---
And so the aetherblade sets remain the most valuable.
---
Nvm, i had dyes on
---
Dude, judging by your posts, you're an embodiment of a virgin. Expensive food, tryhard gameplay, no heals, all the shit you write. There is no surprise you are so mad you need to belittle people on reddit, all the non toxic players have you blocked already.

Maybe (just maybe) play how you want and stop telling others how to play? It's pve and NO ONE CARES, go show your epeen where ppl care (hint: thats nowhere).

Come back when you are good in pvp or something instead of boasting about how good you are against pve mobs.

EDIT: no one is telling you not to play how you like, why are you telling others then? Are you really THAT entitled or just a troll?

&gt;Using a 3rd party site where people have to go out of their way to sign is is stupid.
---
Well, it sure isn't great but - again - those are the only metrics available to us as outsiders. The thing is, there is 220k+ registered accounts on efficiency, even taking in account that portion of those are likely alt accounts that is not a negligible sample pool.
---
The fact that people have to 'go out of their way to sign up' actually supports the idea that the actual % of players participating is even lower than efficiency shows, as I stated earlier. Players more invested in the game are more likely to go and put their api in efficiency than more casual players, those players are also factually more likely to participate in 'harder' (or less casual if you will) content, ie fractal CMs.
---
&gt;Fractals are far more casual friendly than raids
---
I personally disagree here, not even taking into account the entry barrier that is obtaining ascended armour and necessary AR, the two CM fractals are at least on par with most (and I'd even say more challenging than some) raid encounters.
---
&gt;its not out of the question that the percentage of total players doing them is higher than the one on the site.
---
True. The opposite however seems to be more likely due to the aforementioned bias of the efficiency numbers towards more involved players.
---
Edit to your edit:
---
&gt;Also, even highend CM fractals are played at lower difficulties.
---
Ah, I see where you're coming from now. I was talking about the actual challenge modes, which is what - I was under the assumption - we're talking about here.
---
&gt;150 AR doesnt mean anything.
---
I did not really mention 150 AR? The data I'm talking about is concerning the essences..?

There's indeed problem with one WP; my map completion shows 18/18 while there's only 17 visible and the missing one is the same you're missing
---
yeah sure peak endgame content majority of players wont do because of 400+ KPs.   
---
Kill proofs are killing the content. Fractals CM are the worst case of this.   
---
Finding team is stresfull, bosses themselfs are stresfull, too many mechanics, my hands hurt , my eyes hurt, everything is telling me to not do fractals CMs. Worst content in the game.
---

---
I dont think the KP is whats keeping you from CM's.
---
When i dont have a lot of time for all the fractals the only one im doing is 99cm. Nightmare is just amazing
---
The point is that waiting is absolutely a viable strategy in all forms of combat. That includes games and game combat. Sometimes the best thing to do is do nothing for a moment before launching your counterattack. It doesn’t make the combat bad to have pauses or things you need to “wait out.”
---
No what i show is from my personal ticket, not a dev comment. Feel free to prove your point, i know "alt tabbing" doesn't make something against the rules. That'd be almost unlawful to do. :)
---
That looks really cool!
---
That said, that model and upcoming map locations are the exact things I wish Shaman wouldn't share.
---
Glyph effect affects only nodes you're gathering with **that** gathering tool. I.e. if you have glyph in your pickaxe, it will proc on ore, but won't do anything to wood nodes.
---
Applying this to glyph of the forester - let's assume you have one in your sickle. That means every time you gather herbs you have 33% chance to get additional wood material.
---
Then why did you click on it?
---
gonna say this as someone who is doing WvW and just now getting into PvE; usually the normal to nice people severly outnumber pricks ive met in fractals. At most we sit down and talk about mechanics and explain to someone if we feel we need, but usually no one bites down on you for not having a PHD in that encounter. Raids i have no idea about sadly.
---
Possibly the face gives it away. Now this could be Drakkar which is coming in episode 2 of the icebrood saga. I don't think Aurene would be brought back into the story so soon more nearer the point where we are going to fight Jormag.
---
Fake news
---
That weird goose game thing went completely by me. I see it meme'd everywhere and just go "Huh." all the time.
---
If you have a Glyph of Bounty on your pickaxe it will only work on ores. If you put it on your sickle it will only work on plants.
---
Glyphs only work on the harvesting tool you put them on.
---
So as for the Choya Harvest Tool with Forester, you only get extra wood for the nodes you harvest with your Choya Tool.
---
If I have a leather Glyph on my pickaxe and a cloth Glyph on my logging axe, ore nodes will randomly give leather and saplings will randomly give cloth. They don't stack.
---
People sell gen 1 legendaries all the time.
---
&gt; No what i show is from my personal ticket, not a dev comment.
---
its about a completely different context, so not sure why you linked it in the first place.
---
&gt; Feel free to prove your point
---
I have no point to prove, I was just giving out advice on what Anet would consider inactive gameplay with the purpose of earning rewards.
---
I dont multibox or tab out while leeching rewards, nor am I the one responsible to identify those that do and punish them.
---
The difference is that the commander now has a fucking elder dragon on speed dial. It's a given that Aurene will appear at some point in the fight against Jormag just like she was the plot device against Joko, Balthazar and Kralkatorrik.
---
New instance created, wp present on IP 240.
---
”Peak endgame content” = something that people only do once per day?
---
Lmao are you kidding? Anet really killed this game when they made all high level PvE only be worthwhile if you do it once per day. Lets face it, GW2 doesnt have any endgame since the only rewarding fractals are dalies which take an hour max. No one really does the other ones which means you have 1 hour per day of endgame content

Even a stack of five transmutation charges costs more then 100 gems, if you think anything about this is going to be that low, you're setting yourself up for disappointment.
---
Might be a silly question(since there are no lfgs in caledon forest), how do you change your map instance? Do i have to guest on another server?
---
that fact that bags can have a 32 slot in, and i think they are 400 gems a pop, i imagine a equipment tab at 17 slots i think they said shouldnt be more than a bag slot as its less extra space, so id say 300 gems per equipment tab seems reasonable in terms of what its going against, is it reasonable overall? thats for you to decide.
---
Pretty sure you will unlock 1tab for all your characters and not 1tab for 1 character, maybe I'm wrong tho, I didnt watch their presentation
---
Spooky and cute, good job!
---
Why a whole video, when a simple table would be a lot faster to get all the info from, without audio necessary?
---
Gw2 players for 7 years said "I would pay for build templates."  They deliver build templates and are going to charge for them in gems which can be bought with in game currency. They aren't even really charging money for them and the community is bent out of shape over it.  
---
Get over yourselves.
---
https://twitter.com/Kerogen/status/1183434856883281921
---
Already done. Once its done it takes a while for it to appear again.
---
It is funny people keep bringing this up as if we always have asked to pay for build templates, but when i do a search on reddit about this topic, all i find are past threads getting massively downvoted for even mentioning it will cost money.
---
Example:https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/b69a4e/if_they_release_the_build_template_with_only_two/?st=k1pa1xvn&amp;sh=c4adc5e3
---
Deleted images.. I do warn you, these images are indeed a potential [Spoiler](#s "https://twitter.com/Kerogen/status/1183434856883281921")
---
Could be, could be otherwise. It's pretty clear that Elder Dragons aren't always super effective against each other (the big exception being Jormag vs Primordus), so she may not be able to do a lot.
---
But she'll certainly at least be mentioned.
---
Why would Drakkar have rainbow sparkles like Aurene's Brand, look more crystalline than icy and have Aurene's general facial features ? Also she clearly has wings in these, they're just slightly transparent.
---
Besides, the concept art they showed for Drakkar was way different. I know it was concept art but still. This is definitely Aurene.
---
Nightmare is hands down my favorite. The music, the mechanics, just all around well paced and well designed.  100 cm is fun too, but I find it more frustrating in general to pug. It's also a bit longer depending on your team's skill level so I tend to get burned out on it quicker. Still, it's one of the top fractals in my book. 
---
They're really not as scary as people think. If you take in potions it's pretty survivable so long as you understand basic mechanics and important rules of combat, like dodging and cc. Some people never seem to grasp dodging or cc, but most of the time pugs get it by the point they're doing the cms.
---
Gods, he just reposted all neatly in an album, don't panic so much...
---
Yeah, its the rake.
---
&gt; The trait templates mightttttt be 100 gems
---
they come in a pack of three, so probably also 300-400 gems
---
Awesome, not so awesome. I really hope they look back on these two. They are engaging and entertaining the whole way through almost every day.
---
Yes! It's so great how each fight/encounter builds up to the final one as well in both Nightmare and the Observatory. Great stuff.
---
looks like no, there are 2 other sets of footprints that look similar nearby
---
If you're interested in PvE, there's a few things that you need to do
---
1) unlock your elite specs. Each profession has two elite specializations that you unlock for 250 hero points each. You get 10 hero points per node in expansion maps, so you need 50 total to unlock both. These open up a lot of gameplay options, since each elite spec, when equipped, grants you a new weapon choice, a change in class mechanic (F1-F3 skills for guardian), and some new equippable skills and traits
---
2) progress further into the HoT and PoF stories. These will help unlock things like advanced gliding techniques (updrafts, ley lines, etc.) and new mounts (Springer, skimmer, jackal, griffon)
---
3) get geared up properly. This means equipping at least exotic level gear at the minimum
---
If you want to do PvP, just jump straight back into that. There are no real restrictions on sPvP, just make sure you're using the stats/traits/skills you want to use
---
If you're interested in WvW, then you'll want to do steps 1 and 3 from above
---
If you and your friends are all reasonably inexperienced, a guild can be a great place to get some help figuring out the ropes. Check our r/guildrecruitment for all that
---
It'll be interesting to see how close they'll stick to Drakkar's GW1 look as opposed to the initial Icebrood Saga concept art which is vastly different from EOTN Drakkar. Maybe they'll use the same explanation as they did for Primordus's changed look between GW1 and GW2. :)
---
Yeah I was hoping thats the way strike missions would go from here on. In the same difficulty range and teaching some mechanics.
---
Open world gameplay is so dumb and all of the light effects make any attempt to play well so annoying that most people rightfully dont give a shit and autottack until the event ends.
---
Anet can always clean up their game if they dont like it.
---
99 is my favorite, 100cm second, although I adore Arkk's fight. If the first norn dude had more HP and actually survived more than 7-10 seconds once below 33%, I'd like that one a ton too!
---
That, soldier, is a GOOSE!
---
omg hi :)
---
100% agree. 99 cm is amazing.
---
When I started out, I just made my own groups. CMs + T4s, lf XYZ.
---
They filled and we completed them. Just start your own.
---

---

---
Yeah. That's the impression I'm getting. It will be sorted out but it will take a few days

Yeah, I'd say the issue with UESP is that it's covering 11 games published over the course of 25 years, rather than just one and a half games. Meaning: GW2 wiki does talk about lore, characters, and locations from GW1, *but* it doesn't need to go into detail about GW1's mechanics, missions, etc. UESP is like if the GW2 wiki team had to cover the *entirety* of GW1 *and* GW2, plus *nine other complete games*. Because of that, they can't focus or drill down as far into ESO. Plus, there's a not insignificant percentage of their userbase that's still salty about ESO existing at all ("where's muh ES6 whine whine")
---
Every time I go use the Warframe wiki, I am so damned upset. Because I'd actually say the Warframe wiki team is just about as dedicated as you guys (that wiki IS actually updated very quickly, and is honestly better at explaining how to play Warframe than Warframe is), and the community is lovely... but they have to host themselves on Wikia, which is *dreadful*. While I have A LOT of problems with how ArenaNet has been running things, especially since HoT, their approach to the Wiki has been *perfect*, and I want to take Digital Extremes by the lapels and go THIS IS HOW YOU DO IT. I KNOW THAT DEDICATED SERVERS ARE EXPENSIVE BUT PLS. *P L Z*.
---
Honk honk

Not enough bears.

Peace was never an option

Dear ArenaNet:
---
I know things are very, very hard right now. However, please consider for next April Fools, all world bosses replaced by geese.
---
I’ve had a skelk crit me for 19k with ambush on swampland due to outflanked. I wish they’d tone down the amount of extra damage outflanked adds.
---
My bad, removed the original post because it appearantly was a tad to spoilerific for some people so I reposted it in an album complete with chauncey spoiler guard now:
---
https://imgur.com/a/vbcquq1
---
THe whole drama was about the lack of "tabs" and not about the pricing wasn't it ?
---
And to top it all off, killing ghosts in the final fight doesn't allow you to rally if you're downed
---
Nightmare definitely the most fun fractal.
---
"Kill mee"
---
Name of skin
---
Certainly not a player…
---
Siren's Reef, Mai Trin with afflicted and another instab that makes the party take more damage are just the two that come up a lot in my just t4 pugs.  Granted, in just t4s, you can get away with just using riceballs or the pudding and peppermint oil with more Magi's pieces to get around.  That's basically the discount food.
---
Sunrise breeze, pastel peach, pastel pink, or pastel citrus in the first channel and varying colors of whites or blacks in the second channel make good nude colors.
---
Ive done the research.
---
Healbrand is only really useful to carry bad players.  It has damage mitigation, good heals, and tons of extra boons.
---
TFW no PvE content needs all that cleanse.
---
Can i get the armor skins/outfit breakdown of what she's wearing?
---
That is probably because zodiac armour is over 6 years old and the rest are more recent, and Anet is *awful* at updating old textures/content/anything at all really.
---
&gt; CANNOT cost more than 100 gems each, remember, these features are a per character thing.
---
So? Bag slots cost 400 gems and also are a per char thing.
---
Pretty sure I was the instigator of this. (naut here)
---
A bit of both;
---
* some had issues with the amount of equipment templates - 6 vs currently near unlimited arc templates, both equipment and build
---
* some had with the pricing - 6 equipment + 6 build templates per char * 9 professions at least = a lot, a lot of gems
---
* and some with the combination of both
---
Your first real warrior or fantasy warrior?
---
Hey guys, returning player here and starting on a brand new account. How long would it take to get the radiant shoulders and gloves?
---
Thats not drakkar, thats definitely a prismatic dragon, drakkars concept art is this  [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/d/db/Drakkar\_concept\_art.jpg](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/d/db/Drakkar_concept_art.jpg)  Which they showed during the presentation.
---
Why's the Rene have to focus on Stabo when you have a perfectly good Firebrand there?
---
Since Jormag can turn into an ice storm, Kralk could change into a brandstorm, maybe aurene's power is to turn into a.. four-winged prism rainbow?
---
&gt;My proposal is to be mindful of what content caters to what group of people. Raids are not for people who like to dick around without a care in the open world, higher level fractals are literally made for gear treadmillers and WvW isn't meant for carebears.
---
Absolutely, I'd love to have them playing WvW with me, which is my favorite game mode at the moment, but they are not keen to go back there. So we are sticking to Fractals and finishing season 4 of the living world. So far, Nightmare and Shattered Observatory are their favorites, for Siren's Reef they ask me to join their party so they can skip it xD, the rest they are doing fine and I just got them a few +11 agony resistance so they don't have to farm a lot and continue playing as they unlock new levels
---
&gt; Despite the hate and vitriol and overwhelming toxicity in this thread, you do make a few points. 
---
I was expecting some toxicity when talking about raiding, but was really surprised to find so many offended people with the other topics. I was looking for some healthy debate, but found a lot of bashing instead \^\^ I was still reading through a lot of these comments and took some good advice here and there, so overall I still think that there are systems that could be improved or make more engaging for new players, like the ones I mentioned on the opening post.
---
It's more just for the heals and has no internal coodlown on the damage and heal proc.
---
&gt; There's no escaping that kind of information,
---
Around the time of episode 6 release, I remember watching a video about the ending animations, and someone mentioned how they couldn't wait to see how the actual model turns out (referring to the silhouette of ascended Aurene). The information has been out there for months, and you seemed to escape it just fine then. 
---
Regardless, I don't understand the problem. Have we not had enough time to discuss things as they stand already? Because personally I don't generally see any discussion of value (that hasn't already happened before) after about a week or two of the previous release. What of value would have come if nothing is shown between now and the next episode release?
---
I don't recall asura building Divinity's Reach, the Black Citadel, Hoelbrak, or the Grove.
---
I think this was mostly from people who unlocked the Warclaw during the release. But yes, comparing then and now doesn't make much sense.
---
My point was that even without changing the rotation and just using one additional ability from time to time is enough. As reaper you can strip boons without huge dps changes.
---
Healbrand+Power Rene is the LFG spreedrun.
---
Nice! I always suggest playing the game in story order (Personal story &gt; Season 1, no longer available [story recap and  3hr video here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/Story_Recap) &gt; Season 2 &gt; HoT &gt; Season 3 &gt; PoF &gt; Season 4 &gt; Ice brood, [more details here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Story)), but it's up to you. HoT will unlock gliding which is a very nice feature to have. Also what are you still missing in terms of gear? What's your account name?
---
TMW the DPS outlives the support.
---
thanks for the guide =)
---
Guild Wars 2 is the best game I've seen but trust in Anet starts to decline. Sorry for my English.
---
And it's not even the difficulty where they're failing, but the very basic fractal design. Neither TO nor DS nor SR are particularly difficult, but they are just plain annoying.
---
&gt; And if he gets matched up with 3 dps as depicted in the art, they most def need a healbrand
---
Min/max your build around ~85% boon duration.  Less if you use all +5 stat/+9 AR and even less if you have the account bound AR.  The extra outgoing healing from the riceballs can be the difference in ignoring a series of big AoE blasts or mechanics by virtue of being able to heal through it all or not.
---
You do know things can change right Drakkar isn't releasing till episode 2 which will likely be next year. Theres time for them to make a new model.
---
I don't understand why you wouldn't ask your Necro, who is a cut above the rest in boon neutralization, to not  do it ?
---
It's like if a warrior said no when asked to bring banners, it's moronic and selfish
---
Or one of the guardians can bring Stand Your Ground.
---
strike missions are literally easier than base game champion hero point. LITERALLY EASIER: it sucks and it's not fun at all, i did it twice since it came out and i don't think im going back to it :)
---
It's a decent utility to take as you don't need the healing signet and MI requires you to be nearly clairvoyant to grab people who go down while also having a small AoE so you have to choose which player to insta rez with it.
---
The bow covers your ass too when you don't have a symbol down and just need the extra sustain while doing F1/F3 tome rotations.
---
Watterrerrrrrrrrrrr
---
I'm a salty player in comp, and I admit to my toxicity. But in pve and other games when I play support, I try to be more wholesome: if someone says that I'm shit, my answer is usually "Hey, man, I'm  trying my best. " and if I'm reaaaaally agravated "If you want to go support or change group, you can." 
---
It usually works and the next attempt is somehow better! I haven't tried healer in raids, but I don't understand the posts in this thread about T4 fractals... jesus christ with random parties of pugs, I must have one party wipe every three days due to people running in different directions and messing up. Why are people taking this stuff so seriously?
---
The bow allows you to stand off the party if you're the group kiter.
---
I dieded.
---
The dream died when AnetBen left. They could have gone all the way and instead of cms, intergrate them into a new t5 and just add cm fractals there with big achievements, rewards and long term goals or leaderboards or something. So much potential....but we got new story so who cares!!!!
---
Its a pretty fun game.
---
I've seen a condi scrapper recently put other DPS to shame at Xera. He did it not because the build is good (which it really isn't) but because he wanted to flex.
---
I'm no expert in PvP but the most FUN for PvP has to be mesmer, hands down. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiqdclCGSPU
---
Condi chrono and condi FB use it, but I'm not sure that anything else uses it.
---
Nah but spamming Rosebutt in the mapchat should do the trick
---
Deepstone is just as bad imo. They really lost their way on fractals after Shattered.
---
Lul you can make your own group whenever u like without any requirements whatsoever if u want. But it's easier to bitch about it on forums than actually do it i guess.
---
Celestial infusions are not old tho.
---
If you compare to her [model](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/0/0c/Ascended_Aurene.jpg) at the end of S4 it's pretty one to one.  Five winglets, spikes on head/rump/tail all match up, body type is the same.  She actually looks a lot like Glint now.
---
Teq buff too OP needs a nerf
---
Wow. Uh.  Hmm.  Right.  How to begin...
---
Okay, so, this would completely and totally make mirage useless.  Why?  Because a massive percentage of mirage's dps comes from illusions having mirage cloak.
---
In the future, try to learn something about a profession before commenting on them.  Please?  Because with anet as bad at balance as they are, I'm sure they see your idea as a perfectly good idea despite the community recognizing it as a bad one, and I don't think I'll last through having yet another of my favorite specs getting nerfed into the ground by some anet employee who clearly doesn't know what they're doing.
---
Fractals are endgame, ascended crafting is endgame, WvW is endgame, raids are endgame. There's nothing not endgame related in your post. Ergo: You are whiny because new player can't beat endgame content on day one
---
Stand Your Ground.  F3 Tome skill 1 and 5 when SYG runs out.  If you need more than this to phase a boss, something is seriously wrong.
---
DIGITAL INKING
---
The OP is AN ILLUSTRATION. Do you literally think that drawing anything in any way in general is automatically inking? lmao
---
You literally linked a quote that proves the OP has NOTHING to do with Inktober. 
---
Learn to read holy shit, not only did you not read my comment you didn't even read the FAQ your posting.
---
Edit: My groups wanted me to point out to you that your insulting artists who are working hard on the Inktober challenge, just FYI
---
Sounds like literally every attack of any kind when fractals weren't a joke. Other than those that applied agony ofc, those would just kill you.
---
Looks a bit rough/strange, I am sure adjustments will be made for the final version. But I think it's very nice that she may be getting a real model for her new form so soon.
---
How do i monetiz3 a table?
---
I will say that the GW1 wiki was almost as comprehensive, and the only reason it wasn't is that ultimately there was less to cover because it was a smaller game overall.  The Guild Wars community has always in particular been blessed with a certain type of helpful player, whether it be the amazing wiki contributors, content creators who deep dive in to lore like Wooden Potatoes, or people who do super in depth guides like Dulfy used to and maybe hopefully some day will be able to again... and lets not forget the people behind projects like GW2crafts, MetaBattle and GW2Efficiency.

If you're on a US server, I can help. Hit me up on Vayne.8563.
---
What's your trade-off? If you have a time for a game, why not make it GW2, its free to start, and you could decide as you go on. Could keep you engaged for 2-3 years.
---
Forgot your /s
---
I never used the bow and sure as hell don't use a healing signet lol.

On the long term, no.
---
I don't think you need the canyon jumper to get the springer. I mean the springer heart is not really hard to get to
---
you can also get mastery points from achievements and story missions
---
I have played SW:ToR, WoW, ESO, FFXIV, BDO, and pretty much every other major MMO at some point or another.  The fact is... there is no comparison.  There is no other game that has a single resource that is not just so absolutely comprehensive, but also so very clean.  All of the information isn't just there in one place... it's also very easy to find, and for 99% of pages has sensible links to all related content... And to be honest I think that has something to do with the fact that it is officially integrated with the game, but also has so much to do with the hard work and dedication of the awesome community behind it.
---
He does, or else a friendly Mesmer portal
---
Wow, again such a comment and I don't get why...no one of those veterans, elitist raging around (includes me) what ever you wanna call it, would tell you to not start playing this great game...most of us got 4k+ hours as well. Do you think we would not recommend a game we played that long? 
---
Seems like people still don't get the point.
---
Seems like people keep seeing the pure negativity in us... Thanks reddit, just thanks a lot.
---
Nah dude, that's why we're all here talking about it? You came to the right place.
---
For 30 bucks you're getting at least 2 years of solid gaming experience.
---
Nor would the Asura build such inferior structures. 
---
What I’m talking about is the gate network that every city and settlement relies upon. Where would the world be without the Asura gates? Remove every single waypoint and imagine how much progress the other races would have made by now.
---
Better yet, replace all stealth skills with taunts in a 900 aoe.  No one just lets a thief get away, by forcing people to roleplay the character of an angry victim who's just had all their ectos stolen, thief will become more balanced and realistic.
---
Edit: Additionally, Guardians under the effect of a thief's taunt will periodically shout various lines such as, "I AM THE LAW", "I SERVE THE FLAMING FIST" and "STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCUM".
---
&gt; I don't join other groups i make my own. So i have every right to play as i see fit.
---
It's not just your group.  There's no party leader.  You list an LFG with set rules, yes, and people joining your party should agree to those rules, implied or otherwise.  The goal of group content is to get through it.

&gt;Rest asssured people have good runs with me, you can sleep easy.

I play with my static and my guildies, lmao, I'd never see you.
---
&gt;Also when i join (the times i DPS) i always say that i suck at DPS and literally noone cares about my DPS.
---
Probably because you default to the same thing you do on healer; spam skills off cooldown.
---
How to begin would be to not talk condescendingly to someone you don't know who is asking for honest feedback.
---
Did you catch the part about Illusions still being able to use ambush abilities?
---
do you actually speak to people like that IRL? Because im pretty sure if some idiot said that to my face i would punch them =)
---
Also, please send me a screenshot of your magic LFG where HB is trash... Last night at reset literally every single group was looking for one (and when they dont is because they already have).
---
So, lets make a deal, you keep being a toxic fuck and ill just block you ok?
---
XOXO
---
It means noone gives a flying rats ass if arrk fight lasts 2:00, 2:05, 2:10 or even 2:15.
---
And pretty much everyone (except the reddit Pr0 Gw2er tryhards) prefers a 3 min fight when they just DPS a golem and do 2 mechanics, than 1:30 min fight with 0 heals you have to redo if anyone messes up.
---
PS (since people cant read): im exaggerating, even with 0dps healbrand vs 30k dps dh the fight wont ever be twice as long.
---
That would be nice, but in PvE that would be unacceptable I'm sure. I'd rather be able to have the counterplay of being able to cleave clones.
---
Its not gemstore its just game item, dont hope much with how gw2 is going.
---
I'm not really trying to get the class nerfed as much as just moved laterally.
---
@Devs, can we get that topdown view over a starry background or ocean background for my desktop image? :D
---
kalla fields are giantic though, and you can move your tablet if you need
---
молодец !!!!! вот бы и перевод текстов в игре бы делали ) было бы великолепно
---
Its not worth doing then if they arent dailies, thats the problem. You can only get the ascended loot from the daily fractal chest for example. 
---
And since gw2 is pretty much dead, no one in lfg is advertising for any fractals except the dailies
---
It won't let you get the springer until you've trained canyon jumping. It's a hard check built into the game.
---
Thanks for the advice! My next post will use your suggestions. Doesn't GW2 just have the best community? I love it!
---
Please check the edit.
---
just having supper with the family but I'll absolutely hit you up when I get on!  And thanks so much!!
---
Please check the edit ty

The bow heals for ~400 per shot in the aoe, there are literally hundreds of shots and, on average, heals for about 4k-5k in a rather large area over the course of its entire cast on a short cooldown at range, and you get two of them.  The only other thing to take there is wall of reflection if F3 tome isn't enough or the cleanse mantra if the F2 tome isn't enough cleanse.
---
You can access a lot of them by using a teleport to friend item, or by using a portal from a mesmer. Ask around in map chat near some interactable mastery points, you'll find plenty of people willing to help.
---
Sarcasm dude. Hence the "in all seriousness"
---
First, I apologize for my condescension, in my defense I'm used to seeing people suggest changes to Chrono and mirage without actually understanding, or caring to understand, how they work.
---
Secondly, no, I missed your edit.  While that would mostly fix the dps issue, I would rather keep mirage cloak because I kinda doubt my clones would survive all that well to aoe attacks without it, *even with the 66% damage decrease*.  Right now I can save my clones from an aoe attack (and get the dps from ambush) by applying mirage cloak to myself.  When I do that I potentially get a few more uses out of them.  However I'm not sure how well they'd survive without being able to avoid damage, which means I could lose dps because I'd have to resummon them again without shattering.
---
Edit: additionally I'm not entirely sure what you're trying to accomplish.  It's been a while since I last played any PvP, so maybe the playstyle for mirage has changed a lot, but iirc it used to focus on one big burst.  I don't see how removing mirage cloak but keeping ambush would nerf that because your clones won't survive for very long anyway.
---
Yes it is my group because my friend and i make it, and if people don't like how it is they can go away.
---
Im very happy for you that you have a pro static and whatnot, lmao i couldnt care less. I wasnt inviting you to play with me so i really don't understand your reply, are you bragging or what?
---
Also i dont need you to teach me to play and whatever do or not do as DPS, i can just spam everything and still do my job.  Noone i every played with complained about my dps, except my former static leader which was a scrub, but i fixed that very quickly by leaving (he was dead on the floor and got carried by me when he said that btw).
---
By far my least favourite fractal just because of this. If someone goes down, I have to hard rez them and take a ton more damage from the other ads and boss.
---
Oh you went to a map specifically made just for pvp and you got into a pvp? The horror!
---
&gt;Where do you get those numbers from? Because the average DPS is completely different depending on the boss. 
---
My and my friend's logs.  50k burst is the low end.
---
&gt;Also to me it seems you are being overly optimistic with QB dps and you are downplaying rene. My friend plays rene and i literally only see him under 7k at artsariiv. Hes closer to 90 on pretty much every other boss.
---
I play both, have experience on both, and logs for both of them.  I personally play condi QFB in fractals because it's not too much of a difference than Power QFB and I've yet to set up a Power QFB and learn it.  I'm speaking from experience as,  after a boss, I look at my DPS graph to tell how well I did, where the spikes were and where I screwed up my rotation.  Most, if not all rotations on bosses have a really easy to tell pattern of ups and then downs.  Deviations from this pattern tend to mean mistakes have been made.
---
Now, I'm not the best at either of these classes, but I do know my shit about them.  On Rene, the maximum I've ever gotten Burst DPS-wise out of an optimized Renegade was 16k on Skorvaald.  The average DPS throughout most fights has been 7k.  Alacrene is not about DPS at all.  It's all about the utility it brings to a fight.  The CC, the slight extra DPS increase from Kala, extra stability, boon rip, and condition damage mitigation.
---
With Condi QFB, I average nearly 18k average with a burst that's upwards of 56k.  My friend, who mains this class and only this class (Guardian as a whole not just QFB) has had spikes of 70k on both power and Condi QFB.  
---
Compare this to your average soulbeast who does about 15k DPS average with a burst of 60k while also giving out one wolf pack with stance share, and it quickly becomes something similar to 4 DPS with one healer
---
Then they do a music faceoff against the charr metal band.
---
Deepstone is honestly one of the easiest fractals, it's just long as hell for no reason.
---
TO is fine imo, after all the fixes, though mesmer phase of Amala is annoying because I have to dodge my own allies.
---
Siren's is pretty easy, but again too long. 
---
Most of the difficulty comes from random instabilities interacting with the AoE spam boss design. Like toxic trails and afflicted in Siren's or TO.
---
You are welcome! If you run into a roadblock and need help with Aurora hit me up at Solaxo.7409!
---
Yeah, the annoying thing is that I really like the idea of Infinite Horizons the way it is and how much cost/benefit there is to it. This trait is just so bad for PVP I feel like something needs to be done. Its one of those instances of a burst that can't be stopped by targeting the player or the illusions with CC or Damage. You also can't stealth because of all the tracking. Also Illusions spawn on you so you can't easily port away. All this and it's also spamable for as long as the mesmer has endurance. /shrug
---
Yeah that's definitely an omega yikes from me, dude.
---
You also can't salvage or mystic forge the armor you get from it.
---
Can you hide the helmet of an outfit?
---
You can't. It disappeared from the BLC a month ago.
---
I absolutely love playing Nightmare, really one of the best fractals. Shattered I think is too long though. Siren's Reef I hate with all of my guts.
---
I see an April fools opportunity here.
---
Well it's free to play, so you may as well give it a whirl. I love it, GW2 is still a great game after all these years and there's a ton of good content to enjoy at this point. If you find you like it, the expansions are well worth the money.
---
6k AP needed, can get 10/day for daily completing the Hero section (mainly personal story and map completion) gets you 381 (also counts some not yet achievable birthdays for 1 point each), leveling crafting and salvaging things will get you up to 960 points from Tradesman, jumping puzzles and exploration also just reward a lot, the seasons and expansion story has a ton to earn, etc. Really comes down to how much of a completionist you are since you could do story and farm achievements in a couple days - weeks if you really wanted, Halloween is also coming up with unique festival achievements. If you went really slowly and don't aim for achievements it can take a very long time to hit 6k and even if you rush it starting on a brand new account (no way to recover your old account?) will take a while before you get things started (leveling to 80, doing story, map completion which takes 12+ hrs on even fast runs, repeating stuff for AP). [This wiki page](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Achievement) has more details on specific point values.
---
You can hide the helmet of an outfit.  This outfit is doing just that.
---
Occasionally, you can hide other parts too.  I believe the Executioner outfit lets you hide the gloves.  This is quite rare, though.
---
I'm sure it'll get resolved. I only had good experiences with support too. 
---
I'm excited for you guys to jump into the expansions for the first time it really does get better and more challenging. You guys are going to have a blast. I wish I could do it all again for the first time
---
I do hope you guys don't mind getting lost though, HoT is a bid of a maze but I personally love that about it, really makes it feel like a jungle. My main tip is to utilize the LFG more so you can succeed at the map wide Metas. It makes a big difference in HoT especially since there's a lot more group activity than in base game.
---
May I speak as an artist myself? You can see my pictures at profile. The main goal and meaning of Inktober and other art challenges and art, in general, is *DO SOMETHING*. If it is 31 drawings with liner — great. If it is 3 photoshop doodles — that's okay. And that's not only my opinion but my artists' friends as well. You know artists themselves have their own struggles and insecurity about being not good enough in many ways so it would be nice if people don't make it worse with words like "you do it wrong".
---
What's your in game name? I dont hop on much but I'll shoot you an ingame email.  Prob will be on more with halloween events (labyrinth is lots of $$$)
---
You're too kind, thank you for your kind words. I'm hopeful in finding anyone to help out ^_^ I've played for three years and sadly all my friends have left the game. I'd be willing to move to the EU, but it would have to be a busy server and they'd have to be willing to really help out as it would cost gems/gold to move.
---
Yes I understand that, but I still see no point of losing even even 1K DPS for something what your group supports are supposed to do.
---
ДА! Молчу уже про локализацию, но ужасно бесит, что общаться приходится либо на английском, что, в целом, нормально, но мне, например, сложно печатать быстро на бегу и писать длинные относительно сложные фразы (без ошибок). Либо быть транслитным инвалидом и ломать глаза.
---
Also *suka blyat*, of course =).
---
Quackwaddle
---
If I were employed at anet with a position of power, I would replace every single hostile enemy in all of core tyria, expansions, living story, WvW, story instances, dungeons, fractals, raids, you name it... every single enemy with an elite orrian ooze. If the mob in question was champion or legendary, then they will be champion/legendary orrian oozes.
---
That is my wish for this game. The **ultimate** april fool's.
---
Agree 100% lots of different ways it can be done - I wanted a way where I could use them without having to alt+tab out of game, and potentially have multiple different strings pre-setup.
---
&gt;Game is a dynamic system and people who liked it in the first place might not appreciate it's current state
---
I know because that's literally me right now. I don't want to play the game in its current state but that doesn't mean that I'm going to dissuade people from trying it out. 
---
&gt; or even if they do, not see it's perspectives being bright enough to make starting now worth it. 
---
I mean, you don't really lose anything besides time since the game has a pretty generous free trial period. Imo the people who say that it's not even worth taking a look at are being facetious and just want to discourage people for the sake of it.
---
If you compare the top-down render to the cutscene view it's the same ~5 segments; three between the "fingers" and two behind the elbow of the wing. It checks out. There were never 4 pairs of wings.
---
I know this from firsthand experience. I ran into the same problem as OP is describing and my solution was to just map break to get myself into the area for the springer and I found that it wouldn't let me do the heart to unlock it without having gotten the canyon jumping mastery. This wasn't recent either, it was like early 2018.
---
Yes the licenses just give a random skin of any mount type, you can even get skins for mounts you have not unlocked yet.  Whether it makes sense for you to go with the mount adoption license or the select a mount version depends on how many skins from the set you like in addition to the one or two you like best. If you'd really not be happy with any other than a specific one, I definitely would recommend saving for the select a mount version, it will mostly likely be the cheaper route.
---
Yeah. Depending on the kind of license, there are usually 15 skins to choose from. The original license had 30 skins, it's the only one without a specific name like "distant lands". It's entirely random what skin you will get. There is a select license that allows you to choose the skin, but it is three times as expensive. 
---
However, you can not receive duplicates, so you don't have to worry about that, at least.
---
Any valid PoF key will unlock HoT as well, regardless of the source of the key, as long as it is a valid key.
---
It's thoughtful that you're trying to figure out how to help find a way to help smooth out the edges, as it were :3 I think my next bet would be using a controller to be honest. However, I have yet to find s program that works and I'm not very tech savvy to individually input each individual button. And finding someone that's done it hasn't been easy either lol I have a ps4 controller and xpadder that I paid for, but it's gone nowhere. 
---
As for my main issue, it's a cognitive issue. The eye to hand reaction timing. I'm slow to react and then I'm aloe to remember which buttons do what and in a pinch I'm likely to die lol that's why it helps to have a second person with me so they can res me rather than have me have to start from last check point. That and I'm not very good at using my skills most effectively so killing everything the most effectively on my own doesn't help. 
---
As for switching to EU, I actually started in the EU as my friend who convinced me to play lived in England. Lol I play all times of the day Xp
---
Thanks for the detailed post!
---
Dude that looks BRILLIANT !!!! love it &lt;3
---
You need t3 raptor to get springer/skimmer and t3 springer/skimmer to get jackal.
---
Any valid PoF key will unlock HoT. Key word being valid.
---
G2A is iffy on that front and as a result you stand a good chance of having issues like a ban if you buy a key from them. A lot of how they get keys is through stolen credit cards and other nefarious methods.
---
I am quite busy since my school just started the fall term, but I’m part of a friendly and helpful guild I may be able to invite you to! I’ve been friends with some of these people for years and they’re wonderful people. You may not be able to get the same person every time you want to play, but it could be one of your options?
---
It will appear soon in the Black Lion Statuette merchant. Save the statuettes you get from opening chests for another rotation or two of featured items at the merchant. This outfit will be 60 statuettes.
---
Oh man thats excellent !
