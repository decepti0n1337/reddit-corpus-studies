idk how possible that is, could be an interesting thing to look into though, hopefully it isn't too visually cluttering. 
---
---
---
This is a major pro tip.  Thank you.
---
Stormdagger from the gemstore. Had it for a while, and it fits perfect with the Bolt. Now considering changing my armor to make everything lightning dyed :D.
---
so alot of people compare "memorizing" with "understanding", but the important thing to understand is that you have **priority skills** rather than a set rotation. (at least for bosses, golem is straight up rotation of course)  
---
  
---
since your group dps and therefore burst phase timings will vary a lot from pug to pug, you're better off just learning how to pick up after an interruption than to follow a set list of skills.  
---
a good example of this is elementalist, more specifically weaver.  
---
there are occasions between phases or when certain mobs spawn when you want to deviate completely from the "optimal rotation", simply because some skills have situational priority.  
---
and yeah, it still devolves into "just learning the class, man". it sucks, but keep going at it
---
&gt;However, I insist that the best option is doing the Caladbolg achievement 
---

---
I would.  I honestly would.  My problem is that I've got ADHD and honestly, I have a hard time sitting through the story parts of this game. So much talking.  After, I completely forgot the story.
---
/r/trebuchetmemes would like a word with you.
---
I buy continue coins with baubles and I have way too many of it.
---
“You need infinite coin” is another bullshit the community spreads around for no reason at all.
---
Thanks for looking that all up and linking it. I'll look into the episode rewards too, thanks.
---
Yea.. a continue coin is 10 baubles at moto, so each life is only worth 2 baubles. 
---
You can run 1-1 on normal mode and get 2 bauble bubbles and exchange for 250 lives!!!
---
I found that turning auto attack off VASTLY improved my ability to pick up conjures
---
For me was beating the hard jump/section and die to a fking lazy spike cause I stood a bit too much to the right, thus losing all my progression. Thank god they made those spikes visible. I prefer mechanical difficulty over memory 1000 times. 
---
There are other fun effects if you experiment with mini potions, chairs, etc

Prefacing this video essay with a comment:
---
This video is split into two parts, the first being more a more informative discussion on how to fixed ranked and have it be a more rewarding experience. The second is more critical towards DuoQ as a system, and uses counter-arguments from the other side to discredit and criticize DuoQ as a system.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Timestamps incase you want to view either part individually:
---
Part 1:  5:17
---
Part 2: 12:07
---
This wasn't made to target any individual person, though it is highly critical towards a handful of people responsible for some of the actions I go on to mention. I don't think anyone is immune to criticism, especially if they're going to put their opinions out there, but even still; this video does nothing to mention anyone by name regardless. 
---
 
---
The story in vanilla is awful, but it gets better and better from HoT onwards.
---
You don't have to follow it tho, it basically is "go here, kill these things", you can ignore and skip the plot if you want. The battles are overall fun mechanically, and if you rush it you can finish it all in one or two afternoons. It may be faster than farming for the gold and materials.
---
So? Does that mean that [Ignus Fatuus](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ignus_Fatuus) and [Illusion](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Illusion_%28spear%29) are not both phantams weapons? Or how about [Lyss](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Lyss) and [Ilya](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ilya) (granted those two are the same skin, point remains).
---
F
---
Nevermind, there needs to be a space between send and the first bracket
---
Spirit watch isn't really a bad map in concept, but in execution it's way too easy for inexperienced players to miss play it. Big issues include people just forming a murder pit right in the center by the orb or becoming too focused on the orb and giving up every thing else.
---
It is however a great example of Anet trying to give the players what they want (capture the flag) then the players complaining about getting what they asked for.
---
Single shortbow has confusion, which doesn't proc on golem, so just because the bench is 1k more isn't relevant to if its better.
---
Unbound magic? Consuming any of the season 3 harvest items (like winter berries since they are easy to farm), doing the daily achievements in any season 3 zone, using the [unbound tools](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Unbound_Mining_Pick) (though from a profit standpoint you're better with volatile).  Lots of decent ways depending on what you want to do, farming winter berries should be the fastest if you have multiple characters to run it with.
---
Haha really love it
---
Should include what a bard plays like so anyone that has never played FFXIV can help you.

Agreed, just started building these for my mesmer. Hes using chaos weapons right now, which work pretty well too.
---
Those were so good.
---
I agreem the chains are the Phantasmal focus.
---
[SoI](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Signet_of_Inspiration) got changed and with it [blurred inscriptions](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Blurred_Inscriptions) was changed so that SoI hits 10 targets with it traited. This means that if doing raids with 2 chronos both SoI hit all 10 players. You need to seed your boons at the start which means you start with [tides](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tides_of_Time) hitting all 10 and since the change on it now giving quickness on the way out and alacrity on the way back you get both main boons from that alone. Though it isn't needed anymore you can also start with a continuum split [time warp](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Time_Warp) to get quickness on 10 targets right away. Once you get the boons on your allies in the first place it's up to you and the other chrono to hit wells on the group and SoI off cooldown (CD was reduced on well of recall so both wells are 25s). Jaffa posted an [updated rotation guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1154AbvI34) too.
---
It's sad to know devs release fake patch notes nowadays instead adding pranks in-game. 
---
Considering their ability to add mount keybindings, that is exactly how easy it would be... You don't need to rewrite something like key binding from the bottom up in order to add something new.
---
I could likely replicate that entire section of code (at least what it compiled down to) pretty closely. There are only so many ways to do it.
---
&gt; sounds amazing
---
See what you did there
---
cc them go smokescale beastmode sic em and watch them die to your revenant roleplay. If they daggerstorm you want to run away or stealth yourself by leaping with your gs in the smokescale field or hit something around you like a npc with your lb3. You got stone signet aswell to just counter dmg them when they burst you. Gs 4  is great to interupt there pressure or to kite away with. If you are not getting 1 shot from stealth you should be able to win most fights agains similar skilled thiefs. even on my tanky build i can 1 combo most thiefs. If they play the sneaky sneaky  try to 1shot run away builds you kind of have to either run away of kill them before they can kill you. reavealing them when they try to leap in there smokefield is usualy a free kill and using gs4 roughly 2-8 sec after they entert stealth can block there backstab. you can also hit them with all of your skills while they are invisible. 
---
I'd take Airplane Mode back at least.
---
Great suggestions! I agree with all of them. It would definitely encourage people to play Trib more.
---
&gt; TFW April fools content sounds more interesting than anything they have done in a long time D:
---
Anything can be as interesting as you want when you don't actually have to do the work to make it happen.
---
My buttery fingers would like to have a word with you.
---
 **(͡ ͡° ͜ つ ͡͡°)** 
---
Actually, as a developer, the way they started this was indeed correct. While vague, they don't need to go into extreme detail like they ended up doing, unless talking to someone who has absolutely no idea what the hell they are talking about (you, in case that wasn't obvious)
---
Which means you've just been talking out your ass to be contrary.
---
Here's a counter tip for "smart boys": If you don't know what the fuck you are talking about, don't try to argue with those that do.
---
What aspects of bard are you looking for? If you're wanting a dot based spec there are several condition builds (of these, ranger and warrior can use a bow)
---
I'd recommend condition soulbeast ranger as it's a dot ranged dps with a shortbow and you can provide buffs with stance share and spirits.
---
that stuff didnt generate money lol. where do you think they are?
---
It's good dps with a rather simple rotation of two dots, plus a quickdraw proc window. It's one of thr easiest classes to learn for endgame imo.
---
Feels bad.
---
Sounds like a problem with player rather than the game though at that point. Game offers you enough ways to get shit tons of lives easily and if that is not enough for some people they either need to wait next day or pay. What's wrong with that?
---
You don't *need* the infinite coin at all. It is just QoL really.
---
... i may want the pure version for the rest of the year now, great
---
Thanks for the reply! What do you think about the Druid Spec? It seems like it's mainly for healing, but I don't mind that if it has enough DPS to do open world content solo. 
---
Unfortunately not, but you can find another 364 days of Anet Out of Season April Fools Jokes too so why are we surprised anymore.
---
*Bah-dhuum-tss.*
---
Scribe thing is cool, except I highly doubt it's a large part of the playerbase.
---
Unfortunately, posting things like that only makes things worse sometimes.
---
Anyone notice the official site url change?
---
Ah yes, the universal time zone.
---
Tbh though I am surprised comments like this still happen with the whole internet being interconnected across the world and such. I guess internet discourse doesn't have reminders that other countries and timezones exist.
---
That song is gold haha
---
and then you resort to random keyboard mashing and even that gets you shit like
---
&gt; "Erthisertiawsetnerun Mopimsdgjnisdg" already in use.
---
Ye, if you have any other questions I've played both games for far too many hours and raided regularly in both.
---
Yeah that's an understandable question. I guess I hadn't really thought about it. I'm not altogether sure, which I know isn't very helpful. I think I'm just looking for a generally satisfying core gameplay loop. I'd say I probably want to do something with moderate DPS, and moderate support. I just really enjoy the feeling of being helpful, like I'm contributing and I've never gotten that feeling via DPS. It makes me feel, I dunno. replaceable. I think that's why I wanted something with a little complexity behind it, for that feeling of accomplishment.
---
This is the point of his Character Creator Critique series. He's nitpicking about design choice. He's not specifically targeting Guild Wars 2, he's looking at many games.
---
Also, it should be noted, that this is the wiki's April Fool's joke. Which is not worked on by ArenaNet.
---
We may see ArenaNet do an in-game joke yet (I wouldn't count on it, likely just another faux update notes).
---
I know there's isnt really a set endgame as the endgame is how one defines it, but what milestones should a player who wishes to be open to all kinds of end game (raids, high end fractals, fashion wars) go looking for? Obvious ones are unlocking all elite specs, unlocking the griffon, max crafting? Any achievements that are must-haves?
---
Anet didn't write that. The wiki community did :) .  [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/It%27s\_About\_Banding\_Together](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/It%27s_About_Banding_Together) 
---
Stackoverflow is great this year.
---
Should have asked before making a renegade...
---
Thanks a lot
---
Just to be sure, BS means like boon support right? 
---
You might enjoy running a quickbrand build then. It's main pull is that it can provide quickness to the party without sacrificing too much damage.
---
The counterpart to that is the hybrid renegade build, which provides alacrity to party without sacrificing too much damage.

Thank you!! Would definitely do one! That said, the instrumental or "karaoke" version is tuned down and not in this nice high key.

&gt; I like how it's sort of priority based; once you get done with your initial rotation, you basically use the most important abilities as they come up

This describes literally every single MMO I've played past 2004.

And that's a lot of games.

---
Make a comic to reveal what's she hiding in her room
---
I thought this was a fair review over all. I agree with most of what he said. Mind you I don't mind scrolling through faces, but I never thought about using the extra space to show us more and I agree it would have been better. 
---
But all that aside, it's a relatively good character creator, compared to most MMOs I've played anyway.
---
So, what you're saying is you lack creativity T_T
---
Thank you so much. That really helps.
---
ugh yeah. I wanted to see if anyone had gotten the new Wolf captura and gotten any sweet lore, but, guuuuh. nope. 
---
the base game is free, so you don't have to buy it, you just have to download the game and make an account
---
there are two expansions, and they each come with different content, so if you want ALL content you'll have to buy both, but you don't need either of them to play the base game
---
Earthquake hit the server center, which is causing the website to lean at a dangerous angle. Hopefully they can repair the damage before it collapses.

---
&gt; “You need infinite coin” is another bullshit the community spreads around for no reason at all.

This is what you replied to though, disagreeing with it. So i reinforced that what he says is true.
---
I appreciate the help, but still on windows 7. I had to create a new user account and now it runs fine. I'll just chalk it up to another scooby doo mystery of windows.
---
my answer to the devil's advocate:  I understand the philosophy.  But games like super meat boy are just better.  Deaths in SMB rarely feels cheap, while IWBTG just feels like your getting trolled.  You can find several people who agree with me here (https://steamcommunity.com/app/40800/discussions/0/792924952900655039/?ctp=2).  
---
By the time the developers got to world 2, they realized this and heavily reduced the number of invisible instakill mechanics.  Anet just needs to go back through and finish that job.    
---
Remove checkpoints.   
---
lul.
---
First one def longest. Then you learn how to farm efficiently then get excited and craft as much as you can, then you get the legendary burnout, so you either quit the game or keep working for more but in a relative pace
---
I would love to have a Disney cutscene where protagonist sings a song while killing kralk's minions and then proceeds to rush into kralk himself xD
---
I think its bugged when u lost all hearts, the window of the adventure apear i click reset but it doesnt and i need to go to the adventure again. 
---
Good advice. This is the same with adventures anywhere in the game. It's not obvious on them either. lol
---
You can get Box o Fun from Achievement Chests, and randomly from Chest of Black Lion Goods, which is a login reward. I’ve currently got seven of these boxes in my bank just from these sources, and I’m not even at 10k AP yet.

After the aviator trick with the plane accident before and the shitstorm by the community, we cant ever expect anything on first april...

Razorclaw, on the other hand, is outrageously good for tagging

 Colin 😭
---
True, I believe that was in like the middle of March last year.  So I'd count that.  
---
I'm going to assume that's a Rick Roll and I'm not even going to take the chance.
---
Because you can send letters to « character name » instead of « player account name ». 
---
Because when you die and the reset is not working as expected you still have the adventure progress window to press the x.

You can get these boxws from doing achievement chests
---
This game is almost exclusively about active defenses, not passive defenses. No amount of toughness or vitality will allow you to just shrug off damage. You're intended to dodge, block, or otherwise avoid damage, not take it on the chin. Tanky builds are builds that include lots of active defenses you can utilize.
---
Last year we got chairs. April 1st this year is on a Sunday so they might have something small on Tuesday.

---
You already play with Sigil of Earth on SB/SB  and on SB+A/T so you would need to pick another sigil (Sigil of Venom or Sigil of Blight would do the trick I think).
---
&gt; you can get them as drops,
---
no you can't, pumpkin

Having made Quip and The Moot, I still have around 20 in my bank, which I didn’t buy. Just wait for achievement chests or gold&gt;gem it.

Post removed: the video appears to have been removed by the user. If this is fixed, let me know and i'll reinstate the post!

Yes, you have. But not for the box: for all the fiking money you need to craft them 
---
You can earn clovers from reward tracks in WvW or PvP.  You can also buy 2 per day from one of the Fractal merchants.
---
Or, as it is known, SB³ (which is still hands up one of the funniest build names, together with d4 (d/d DD, but no one uses that name unfortunately))

This worked for me.

Disabled uBlock and Ghostery for site then refreshed. Email arrived. I confirmed the subscription then the options on the settings page stayed selected.

You can also get them from the mist-warped bundles from LWS3 maps.  Although the drop rate is lower than other items, it is still a possibility.

Wish I had been there, this is my first year in GW2 and I hoped for something fun like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3msv_8SxLg) but seems there's jack shit going on apart from SAB (which I love, don't get me wrong)
---
If you enjoy ele/mes I can only suggest engi or even rev. Everything else will get very boring very fast.
---
I'd still suggest finishing all elite specs on ele/mes anyway so you can see the full potential of them. You never know, you might not even want to reroll class after that.
---
with an arbitrary cutoff between brackets?
---
Do it for the vine!
---
Incredible! :-)
---
A bard class sounds good. Time to return to GW2 permanently, WOO!
---
Don't quote me on this, but it's the most likely to reappear on Tuesday when they release the SAB Chair.
---
look at that smug bastard smiling as he tells someone the world's fucked.
---
i can relate to that
---
Www players get fucked  and are used to  having significantly less cash or are forced to pve for gear. Many have gone into raids or fractals at some point.
---
Those who havent, even at 5 to 10k hours in game time often have very little gear in comparison.
---
You can find that cat next to SaB node. Its not a Bee Dog "cat" but normal little kitten with her ears down and coller with SaB bubble. Sometimes that kitten will thow a bubble on that node.  But she spawns somewhere else. In Rata Sum that cat will spawn and then walk to the node. Just camp the SaB node if you have it and you will find her ;) 
---
Ahh that explains everything! I wanted BEE DOG, sigh. Thank you for clarification mate.
---
I find it a bit of an inconvenience for a bit of vanity. 
---
"I was first, I get to be the only one called [Insert name of Anime/other video game/Fantasy character] Everyone else will need to spell it wrong, give a middle name, ect. I'm so  cool that I'm the only one with the actual name."
---
Then sometimes you see people requesting that if a player doesn't play for a prolonged time the names they have become available. Which would be unfair. You could leave, then your friend starts playing a couple of years later, you want to play with them. In short it would alienate returning players.
---
People wouldn't make unfair requests like that if there wasn't a limit on how many people could have a name.
---
it's sad to see a young asura not realize the potential with a field of study. think of all the weird shit out there in nature
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Bee_Dog_Cat.jpg
---
And if you cant find her even now then you probably have your Feline Dispersing Emitter turned on. Then you will not be able to find any cat in your home. 
---
I loved the airplane mode! At first I was like wtf is going on? Then I remembered the date! So fun just running around going brrrrr
---
The base game is free to play till level 80,with market limitation and no daily login rewards.I would recommend buying the expansions,each one comes with a level 80 boost,but if it's your first time leveling in gw2, I'd recommend starting a new char and level from scratch.
---
All it would need to do is when you start typing in the character name give a drop down menu of account names that use it. Give priority to contacts and guild members. Then players on he same server or ones you have been in contact with previously. Then the rest.
---
Why do you try to rush it? You Springer will unlock at the right time.
---
Stop rushing through GW2.
---
Expansion content starts at 80, so if you want to start a new character you won't really benefit from owning the expansion until you're back up to 80.
---
I just came back after 6 years and found that just manually getting a new character to 80 has been a much-needed refresher.  I'd recommend it.
---
I am tilted
---
Lmao, have you tried doing the story? xD
---
how about "a different name"?
---
The fb+ren meta is fairly new so it's nice to see more and more people play it in fractals. Since the waiting times are a bit higher here is a tip to reduce them: Keep adding Healbrands to your friendlist and just keep asking whether one wants to do fractals with you :) 
---
Oh jesus fuck
---
Congrats! Bolt was my first legendary.
---
Jesus you guys are salty over semantics. 
---
I'm seeing a lot of criticism and a whole lot of no answers. 
---
The griffon and player are both T-posing basically
---
do you know when reaper becomes less boring? when you finally realize how much better active defenses(blocks, evades) are, compared to soaking up hits
---
then you realize you're playing something that basically only has 2 dodges and you can't really soak up the big hits with shroud
---
what i think you should do? just try them all out and see which one you like
---
I got the name "Try Anything" after getting frustrated.   I decided to keep the name.

FOR GREAT JUSTICE
---
Ive seen a few state it alrdy. Dont go through the entire rotation at once. I just learned condi rev and wow is my rotation clean as hell now lol. And this is a spec i absolutely hated. Learn it in parts. Set the golem to 40m hp so you dont need to keep respawning it.
---
Id have to look at condi firebrand because i dont know it but lets say the first part is 15 steps. At step 9 you use a tome skill. Work on steps 1-8 first untill you no longer need to look at it and have it down solid then move on. If you mess up get ooc and start over.
---
Ive done the condi ren opening and shiro part soo many times before i got it down so dont worry and take your time.
---
this! i'm over 20k deaths myself due to SAB tribmode and tiny cracks in structures in wvw XD

We all wanted it to be a bee dog, but for some reason they did not make that happen. It was superdisapointing and why i never got that cat, because of the pain to get it and just get another cat and not a bee dog :/
---
Legendaries were supose to be a hassle to obtain.
---
Not your run of the mill, item you can craft on a whim.
---
Come on its Awaken. They are "dead" and they do "rot". Its a joke =/ 
---
Laughed at battle royal musical chairs. Beautiful. 
---
The only time i pull staff out is when someone messes up claim sloth isnt moving or gors retal phase type stuff lol. 100% axe/wh. Need heal outside ca? Watter spirit active regen and nature spirit healing have it covered.
---
Are there any sites or discord servers that organizes community events like HP runs on HoT maps, or even organized meta events?
---
I was under the impression they added a stun break to the health potions to make up for fixing the bug.
---
The issue is that a lot of players never plan ahead. They decide to make one and realise shit i need this and then they need to farm a lot of gold. But instead they could plan ahead and pick the log in reward at the end of the month that give you clover, play WvW or PvP for rewardtrack and get clovers, for other rewards in game that can give you clovers and suddenly you sit on a pile that is by far more then you will ever need and can make legendaries when ever you want too.
---
So for people reading this and did not make one yet, plan ahead!
---
Heh, but getting 7 clovers from the 28 day chest is quite shit
---
Soulcleave makes other people do damage, not you. While the buff is applied by you it doesn't make any effect on your personal contribution. 
---
I encourge the dps greed at shakes for i run heal scourge and spam all the barrier and cleanse :D. But ya on any healer based class..im here to heal wounds not stupid

Well if you like your thief i would say Dare Devil is a lot of fun to play in PvE.
---
me\_irl yesterday 
---
Neat! Never finished first collection for Nevermore... I'll get there someday!
---
&gt;	Why buff before a fight? Because it causes more damage.
---
&gt;Why cast A before B? Because it causes more damage.
---
I mean, yeah, sure, but often there's more to it than that. Like casting an AoE with lower damage before a high damage skill because it's a quick cast that'll be ticking is damage away while you're on to bigger and better skills.
---
Sometimes a skill sets up others or has an unseen function in a straight list.
---
Ideally, I'd love to see builds presented as flexible, malleable, "rationale based" builds tweaked around the best likelihood of overall success in the widest array of circumstances...with rotations presented in a way that somehow gave you the rationale and intent behind them instead of a rather opaque list for this very reason.
---
Rangers of GBL in between the blobs of BBL and RBL
---
swords and staff would just match the "mist" theme, not the legends, core weapons didnt mirror any of the baseline legends sadly, it would be cool but it wouldnt be right since weapons wouldnt match everyone.
---
I mean, hammer for Jalis, sword for Shiro and Staff for Ventari would be cool, but what for Mallyx? maybe mace, but axe, spear and now trident wouldnt make any sense since there's no legends left for them to have a theme.. 
---
It's a fand's april fools joke
---
that wasn't offensive, that was disturbing

Fear not that camera, you will eye contact iiiiit, assert dominance on it Kappa

Nice joke

Those eyes.
---
Spooky!

Does anyone know what software Anet uses to make their maps? 
---
You can't be serious.
---
Did somebody say [Awaken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUhVCoTsBaM) ?
---
Praise Joko!
---
I was talking about HoT and PoF. Soloing champions is tough for my weaver, not with my reaper. Never tried soloing a legendary (people rush toward them anyway) but I gues it's not possible.
---
I think we could use fractals' instabilities in trib, should be quite easy to implement
---
&gt; a lot of coordination
---
3 players spam F. 2 players agro mobs. or use build in countdown, the fire trap before drake is what they tend to dislike
---
Thanks, I will do an engi or a revenant next, depending on my friend next reroll.
---
Navigating this website is hurting my head so much
---
Yup I really miss that there is nothing this year, always found them refreshing. :-(
---
I'm a Charr and what even IS armor?
---
If you like gear profession, maybe you could be interested in getting a lot of Alt characters (by my standards, 20+), equipping them all the ascended gears necessary for end game contents. I play raids and WvW zergs a lot. Each game mode has a set of many working meta builds. My kind of end game is trying and mastering all the builds so I can be a versatile asset for my team. Besides, don't forget Fashion Wars.  
---
Each of my characters has a role. My oldest ones are saved for Vanity - all the purple legendary gears, expensive infusions and skins. The next older ones are WvW main or Living Story Heroes or AP/Daily Worker. The third generation are my Fractal and Raid mains. The fourth generation are Raid or WvW Alts. The last generation are open-world meta farmers. I guess my next set of characters would be reserved for the next coming elite specs?  
---
According to gw2efficiency, I have 21 ascended armor sets, 3 legendary armor sets, 12 legendary weapons, 1 trinket and 1 backpack. I'm content with my personal goal and achievement.
---
Please anet, don't joke about Wizard Tower...
---
Until lvl 80 you dont even have access to any hot or pof related stuff. So you're good to go now, get max level, explore some core tyria and then buy hot/pof at sale

I guess the bee dog I'd an illusion of the cats avatar. Beedogs dont exist in the real Tyria.  It's pretty amusing to see the cat has the title though

Better jump in on the karma farm while I can.

Think it was a beta event cause I remember it too.

There also use to be a giant risen crab miniboss in the Sylvari zone after the Morgan’s leap chain.

I will gladly do things Anet asks me too if skins are involved.

I made my first (and only) legendary within 3 months, with a bit of planning and spreadsheets.

Quite unlikely, but not impossible. If they do, please  do let us know.

Why would you think that means it's not fanmade?

Ugh, I wish we could have an ice-themed expansion 😫 Jordad when 😈
---
In gw1 there had to be a space in the name. That a confusing to some people
---
You won’t have the ability to play the revenant, but otherwise leveling from 1-80 will be exactly the same with or without the expansions.

I just called mine "delete me", you can have that one but someone else might have it by now

Having spent a lot of time playing both games I'd say Ranger is your class to take, soulbeast elite spec is very close to bard - dot-based damage (called condi in this game), ranged, provides group buffs
---
Raids wing 6 ?
---
Im sorry :(.
---
Is it really EST or do you mean EDT?
---
Lost me at build templates
---
I think a lot of their work happens in Maya (from Autodesk) iirc what they mentioned in a few interviews and on previous job posting.
---
a dev said it wasnt really a planned feature and more of a "bug".
---
I'm am legitimately a Fractal God.  You don't have to explain shit to me.  In fact, it's exceedingly annoying tbh.  I've earned something like 500-600+ essences and have 25+ sets of ascended armor.  I've been doing Fractals for years.  Mediocrity in GW2 is not overstated.  People just get habituated to more experienced groups and have an inflated sense of the "average" skill level because they never bother playing with anyone significantly worse than them outside of their raid statics or CM Fractal groups.  
---
Yeah, I've been trying out the april fools 'Chronomancer' support class
---
you post it on very wrong day..... its several days when this first time apper here, but now people will think its april joke
---
k
---
1:50 It suppoused to be April joke not Halloween on steroids!
---
Relatable
---
you understand it wrong -its not "six raid wing per year" its "sixth raid wing per year" - like per this year (or more precise 2018)
---
The song is kinda funny at the top of the page. 
---
When does the guaranteed unlock from black lion chests change? I bought keys on sale, but the current guaranteed unlock is complete ass so I don't want to use them yet
---
Maybe we're tired of people using words like promised for something that wasn't promised, and it's a bad look for the game. Anet makes a statement and doesn't deliver, that's bad. Anet doesn't make a statement and people claim they did, that's bad too. I don't know why a downvote would surprise you in that case.
---
[Yes yes yes yes yes.](https://oldreddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8xqfzi/the_crossover_no_charr_asked_for/)
---
only hurts ur 1st 10 runs there. when u master trib mode, u throw about 10~min for whole w1, and about 10min per w2 zone. which is not that much time.
---
but i must agree if u run ur 1st time9 which was like 2hours per zone for me 4 years ago, its really feels like "Fuck you".
---
Ah that's quite sad right? The exact same thoughs I had when I saw it :(
---
dev said that they cant do acc bound unlockes due to how sab was created. i remember that from last year.
---
lol, the only thing that encourages me to play sab is amount of funny deaths.
---
You're giving people the wrong impression regarding off meta versus plain trash specs imo. 
---
Various specs you mention arent meta because they're only good situationally. Many of them require a certain play style, I.e. daredevil is pretty strong in the right situations. But in those situations, those specs fill a certain niche and can be strong when played around.
---
Other specs you mention suffer from the same issues but also dont fill a niche appropriately. Even in situations where they're supposed to be good, other specs are still better. These specs only have a place if you desperately wanna be or play something different and dont mind giving up power for it. An example is stance share soulbeast or power reaper.
---
Some of these builds are strong in the right situations. Some of these builds are plain garbage no matter the situation.
---
If your backline is meme DH, gs mesmer and various other trash then you're going to have a bad time.
---
Yes, and i don't see any problem, since you can get gems with in-game golds. Nothing different from the icy runestone for example, where "you are stuck" in buying them for 100g.
---
At least here you have other possibilities :D
---
I signed up for all three because why the hell not.
---
12h? thats a lot u seem not that good on jumping. 
---
idk, why u dont wanna try it again now, if u dont enjoy EXTREMELY hard content, then just run normal modes. infinite coin is easy accessible for anyone, much more accessible than mount skins.
---
Necro doesn't have much survivability outside of the easier parts of open world. It is the profession with the fewest dodges, fewest active defenses, fewest hard saves around, and every time you take damage, you lose ridiculous amounts of DPS because you hit like a wet noodle outside of death shroud.   
---
So yeah, the correct time to stand there and soak hits on a necro is never.   
---
By the way, if you are looking for a spec with "crazy aoe" for tagging mobs in PVE events, you are better off with scourge. Superior target count and better AOE spread. 
---
&gt; Should I unlock the elite spec of my mesmer and are they fun 
---
Why shouldn't you unlock your elite specs on all of your characters? No really, is there any good reason at all? Farming up the skill points is trivial (join a train for HOT and you can solo POF easily) and takes only a little time, while you will be gaining access to unique gameplay and mechanics.   
---
What?
---
[Cham-pag-en](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/15/Captain_Zapp_Brannigan.png/175px-Captain_Zapp_Brannigan.png)
---
I had completely forgotten about that open beta event, along with the branded PvP one.  
---
Back then it felt like Anet could push new and interesting content so quickly into the game, but I guess they took a lot of development resources... It's a wonder neither event has made it back into the game at some point.
---
Shouldn't that be the ABI?
---
1) You can farm winterberries on multiple chars each day, which makes farming trinkets there pretty fast so your choice for first one doesn't matter. I'd go with backpiece first because... 
---
2)...you can get other trinkets with core stats from fractals, guild commendation vendor and laurel vendor pretty easily.
---
3) LS3 trinkets are unique. However, attuned and/or infused rings act as separate items, so you can do that if you don't plan to do higher fractals very soon. You'll need different accessories though. 
---
Huh. My boss said the same thing about my code during stand up today. 
---
Honestly been fanboying anet and been whiteknighting at times that devs are human too and ppl need to understand their hard work even when their PR sucks ass, which is true in most cases. However, this right here, the devs deserve this.
---
Yes! Desert suuuuuuuuucks.
---
&gt; LS3 trinkets are unique. However, attuned and/or infused rings act as separate items, so you can do that if you don't plan to do higher fractals very soon. You'll need different accessories though.
---
I don't understand this sentiment.  I do understand the first part about the winterberries and such though.  
---
Even before then, humans weren't in Tyria originally, the gods brought them there.
---
All hail the new overlords
---
Would have been better if all the armor and trinkets were random stat combos.
---
Don't Druids in Guild Wars 2 harness the power of the stars? It's why it's we go into Celestial Avatar and not Nature Avatar.
---
I mean, I understand that there are "Druids" in the Guild Wars 1 sense that are more nature orientated, but Druids the "Ranger Elite Specialization" doesn't really fully confirm to that notion.
---
Wait, there was backlash for that? 
---
except it uses offhand ranger axe which is primarily melee focused... also they werent ranged until a comparatively recent change
---
Key binding (or at least, the ability to intercept keys) is a very basic aspect of applications. It can be added to an app in a matter of minutes. That's why so many people are saying it's not hard, because it's a well understood and common thing to do.
---
Impressive how i jumped through this part with no problem this year... But last year was another story. No explanation why. 
---
My advice would be: just go and don't think about it. Maybe it's like driving you know. Just act, don't think about action.
---
Honestly this was harsh.. I'm actually more for the North than cantha expac and this had more of the dream lists than I thought
---
Recently set up my nieces with an account each because they like randomly running around in the game. Picking names was a big challenge for them make more difficult with how many were taken. 
---
Although to be fair, 8 year olds aren’t as original as you’d expect in thinking of character names. 
---
Is it really that exclusive? 
---
Sure
---
I wish there were a way to configure it to only save successes in the first place.
---
Sure but by this logic Ascalon is rightfully owned by the Grawl, which is absurd. The humans cultivated Ascalon over a significant period (1000 years) and the Charr raised the land via the searing, destroying not only the human civilization, but also the livelihood of the land. Their willingness to destroy, together with the enormous period of which they were absent, really makes me question any claim the Charr have. 
---
I'll be the first to say it: Welcome all DnD bard refugees!
---
- new dungeons
---
- build templates
---
come one, at least try being convincing ;)
---
dodge jump works, but it needs weird angle to hit the green stump
---
Yep. Bunch of assholes likened it to a then-recent plane crash in France calling it 'highly insensitive' despite it being front-loaded into the game weeks or months in advance.
---
The sepia filter (brown filmgrain) was also irritating for some which I could understand as it gave people headaches.
---
Reaper is great for soloing 
---
Well, what i meant by 'que' was queue. I don't speak spanish, so i didn't know it meant something else.
---
SMC is claimed by me, and me alone!
---
Some* were running around. Most of us didn't have a clue what the ruckus was about.

But that's how it goes, that's why we can't have nice things.

For the love of pancakes they need to let us bind the dodge jump to a hot key. It’s not that players can’t figure out how to do it reliably because of skill, it’s because the game’s technical back end variables influence the success rate of the move. The game is apparently not capable of having a double hotkey trigger work reliably even when you perform the key trigger perfectly, (this has been objectively tested with macros which proves this point). Due to this inconsistency for no designed game mechanic purpose, it should be hotkey bindable. 
---
Pls no lol.
---
This, plus the bounce mushrooms and trampolines in W2-2 are getting more random with their responsiveness each year.
---
afaik you didnt have a choice during the aprils fool. later came the aviator box
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day_2015
---
If you're going to use those clovers for something, then they're absolutely the best option from the 28-day chest.
---
But Yoshi can't swim.
---
I think it's more she is an indoor asura rather then an outdoor one.
---
To me, the hardest jump in SAB is somewhere in the middle of w2z2 where you have to dodge jump onto a very slippery pagoda before the second Octopus feeding segment.
---
Yeah yeah, code is code any everything is like you want it to, I get it. 
---
Have nice day, bye.
---
And still insults.
---
I had the exact same reaction lmao. First I was like "let's see this April Fool", then "hummm this could almost be real".
---
Then saw "new dungeons" HA HA busted, then "build templates", even worse, that's a shame :D
---
Meh. GGG did it first. Last year (or a year before last)
---
Meh
---
&gt; Mistlock instabilities have been renamed "fractal birds" for clarity. 
---
I can actually believe this
---
Those trampolines caused me so many deaths, they won’t register most of the time or if you get hit for some reason it knocks you back. Grinded out 12 tokens though and it wasn’t that bad compared to w3. Wish I just paid for that wing when it was possible. 
---
No, I try to end this conversation, because I don't want to "discuss" with know-it-alls, who needs to insult other people to feel better. 
---
Use facebook or whatever for those sht.
---
Or maybe they let Colin keep his Anet tag
---
Seems legit. 
---
You really must like floating numbers  (ಠ_ಠ) 
---
If you were legitimately a fractal god then you would know that even though burning is one of the burstier conditions, it still does not come anywhere close to a proper burst rotation from a power dps class in fractals.
---
Mediocrity is overstated - you're just an elitist c###.
---
&gt; Reduced the number of scourge shades scourged when a scourge shade scourges shades.
---
Well, fucking finally. Was OP anyway.
---
&gt;    Axe skill damage increased by 5.999% repeating.

Now if only metabattle would update the real builds. 
---
It is literally impossible to host a competition with your anecdotal complaints in mind. Do you want everyone to get a participation reward for killing Cairn in 10 mins?
---
I'd love to have a virtual assistant for the communicator that does fluff like that actually.
---
they stopped doing ingame jokes because:
---
1 there were people who were angry about them ("turn off that fly sounds Anet, I cant play! @$1 wtf is this? "`)
---
2 they dont have april fools team anymore, and rest of the teams dont have enough people to do anything other then what they suppose to do already.
---
Haha yeah they removed a dye channel for legendary armor!
---
&gt;Added new mount race events featuring the warclaw to all WvW maps. Please show good sportsmanship and don't attack players who are waiting for the race to start.
---
Thats can be amazing.. for real.
---
&gt;Please show good sportsmanship and don't attack players who are waiting for the ~~race to start~~ daily veteran slayer
---
Make this real at least
---
The fart sounds on chairs are actually in the game
---
Is this supposed to be a joke?
---
Bad idea.
---
You also don't seem to be a good mesmer.
---
Mesmer does need some help in wvw, because it just plainly sucks atm, but not in veil department. (although i almost never run it because it's almost never used correctly by commander and people followin).
---
Oh wait really? I compltely missed that since I dont use chairs.
---
&gt; The Personal Story has been renamed Professional Story to reflect that this is your character's job.
---
Okay, I giggled at this one.
---
I’d love for them to actually play around with environmental conditions. 
---
IF commanders flame you for not placing veil perfectly just fucking leave squad
---
But to be honest your only real viability in zerging is going to be veil/iol so if you're coming into a comped squad you should expect to be using those as needed
---
This is not funny at all. Cringe worthy. 
---
idk they arent very funny anymore tbh
---
If only they put this much effort into the game.
---
The D&amp;D references made me chuckle.
---
The bunny D:
---
Man... I really want to play a Bard too, :(
---
Actually sad. 
---
Last years' was the best because it completely excluded rangers from the update (my buddy is a ranger main to my amusement).
---
WvW forum at that point:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LZCXiUkq-Q
---
Know idea if you're good or bad at it.
---
But you sure are doing it more than other people!
---
"Raised the water level in Hall of Chains to facilitate the use of underwater skills in the final encounter."
---
It's finally here boys.
---
I think the adding birds into pvp was pretty funny.
---
&gt; Increased depth of symbolism on all guardian symbols by 25%.
---
Okay but just give me hipster pants for my guardian or my character will never be complete
---
Renegade, probably. It has a fairly strong condition (DoT) build that uses shortbow (plus mace/axe), and it swaps between Legends (stances) to change its utility skills, and one Legend (Kalla) has utilities that buffs allies' attacks. Plus, in all stances, it has skills that give allies boons (might, which increases damage; and alacrity, which lessens skill recharge).
---
Man I hope my bonuses help with that new thief initiative thing.
---
It was labeled as w3 on dulfys site, but yeah I meant that.
---
Well doesnt take them anything to enable it again...
---
Seriously, I actually giggled out loud at the Thief initiative bit.
---
Does this mean that I'm going to have to put up with guardians telling me that their class is just so ~deep and meaningful~ now? Crap.
---
hahaha

---
The real letdown is that none of those are real.
---
Because the teaser for Sparkling Pools (W3Z1) is no longer available, and the achievements ("Super Adventure Secret" and "Special Instruction") were only part of SAB in 2013 release of "Back to School", when the preview of W3z1 was available.
---
Both achievements for the preview were retired and the preview of W3 removed from the game. There's no point having a preview is we'll never get W3.
---
At this particular moment in ANet's history, 15 mintues of good, light-hearted PR is more important.
---
Well this one was weak. I think the "lol random sex joke" charm is wearing off.
---
At least, in April Fools' Day, WvW got some love...
---
This one is used for the wiki’s unofficial April Fools patch notes. 
---
I mean if you look at it like that you might have a point. The game is a joke already so no harm done. 
---
this is good april fools joke, i rate 8/8
---
I'm usually the slowest person in my friend group so I love doing trib with friends because they trigger the fingers for me

A tryhard troll in 2019. Amazing.
---
Only if I can spam Fear Not This Night and every player around me has to listen to it. 
---
I take it you've got an interest in the dead then. Necro main?
---
imo is veil 1 in some situations a restriction to the gameplay of the mesmer, that is supposed to be instant-placed if the commander says so. About the toxicity thing i don't have any opinion cuz idgaf about what ppl trashtalk in general.
---
the fact that mesmer is atm mainly considered to be a veil-slave in wvw is kinda sad but that's another topic...
---
\&gt; Use voice command "Dessa!" to get started. For example, "Dessa! Play 'Fear Not This Night.'" 
---
My flair is relevant! At long last!
---
The confusion remapping your keybinds temporarily sounds like an amazing thing that should stay. 
---
I used to struggle there too, but realized this shortcut wasn’t worth the hassle and opted for using the slightly longer route instead. It turned out to be less time consuming.

.999 repeating is equal to 1. Thats not a limit or a weird abstraction. It's simply an oddity of decimal representations of numbers

When playing scourge, if I drop multiple shades at the same place, and stand there too, will my skills have more intense effect? or should I use the multi shades just to cover more area or to maintain uptime?

---
Reminds me the time I was hosting a little LAN party at my house and a friend showed up and was trying out GW2 while everyone else was getting set up. Brand new account and everything, but he couldn't for the life of him, get a single character name to stick.
---
If you knew him, you'd know why it was hilarious, like he was seriously going into a panic attack.
---
Of course he created a male human warrior and was trying names like: God Slayer, Christian Knight, Justice Crusader .etc
---
r/punpatrol Drop your weapons, now! That includes the second set!
---
If you have two of the same ascended ring, you will not be able to equip both. However, you can apply effects in them called "attuning" and or "infusing" which will let you equip multiple of the same one. This effect doesn't change the atributes, but adds one more infusion slot. Attuning a ring is very cheap, infusing can be a bit expensive.  
---
For example, if you have two ascended rings called "Bloodstone Ring", you can only equip one of them. But, if you attune or infuse one of them, they will be called "Attuned Bloodstone Ring" and the regular one will still be "Bloodstone Ring", so they will act like two diferent rings.
---
You may remember this was posted a few hours earlier. The post was deleted by a moderator due to the original video, as I predicted, being taken down due to editing mistakes. This is a repost with the link to the reuploaded video
---
"Desspacito"
---
&gt; .999 repeating is equal to 1
---
no, it is not. It may be approximately equal (≃) though.
---
Confirm this tomorrow and I'll believe it.
---
THat's because WvW is a joke
---
sadly, it lags just as much for me :D
---
Haha April Fools! I love WvW
---
Wow very nice, I haven’t played gw2 for a year or so but that song... takes me right back to those glorious days, Such a beautiful song
---
Why do they keep saying 'visit the gemstore' to unlock episodes? You have to unlock it in the Story Journal.
---
Or am I missing an entry? I know you can buy the episode packs post-season...
---
Each target can only be hit once per cast, so the shade effects don't stack per target
---
I predict that the last living story episode will pop once ANet finish these "welcome back weeks"  this is week 2, so I guess we are looking at 30th May for either the trailer or the episode
---
Nope. It's 6.
---
fuck you're still alive and kicking.
---
"The Personal Story has been renamed to Professional Story to reflect that this is your character's job." 
---
Ain't that the truth XD
---
Sure if Story &gt; all for you play HoT first. Even then I'd still do the first part of PoF for the raptor mount and maybe even the springer mount. Those two mounts made HoT much more enjoyable. While I somewhat enjoy the story in GW2 it's not why I play it. Sorry I should have made the clearer.
---
Oof. That changes everything. Thanks, my dude.
---
I know, I am memeing, isn't that the point of this post
---
Brace yourselves! I think it’s going to explode!!
---
It's 100% legit. We don't know if it's feasible to convert all the existing maps and assets, but hopefully it'll see some use for future expansions.
---
There is. 1 less achi which newer players cant get.
---
“Daily ap cap so new players can catch up” doesnt make much sense if they make everything they can historical

Praise, for he has arrived.
---
Some of these would actually be so much fun in they would get implemented in game, at least once in a while. I'd love these ones:
---
&gt;Confusion now randomizes your key bindings when it is applied, in addition to its previous effects.
---
&gt;Added new mount race events featuring the warclaw to all WvW maps.  Please show good sportsmanship and don't attack players who are waiting  for the race to start.
---
&gt;Added a new environmental hazard to the Battlegrounds
---
Flair checks out
---
If this were GW1 and it was an elite Mesmer skill that caused this, it would almost be believable!
---
GW1 did.
---
Hyperbole is the best way to get your point across. True story.
---
Check the store tomorrow, it's not available yet.
---
Actually
---
If they would change it
---
I think it would be awesome

 So i was playing some necro in WvW and one thing that bothers me really bad, is the fact that it seems to be a necessity that i play with wells as my utility skills.
---
i like to support my zerg and my commander for the most part but with wells in particular it comes with so many restrictions to builds and gameplay that it just puts me off playing necro.
---
my first problem is that i'm never free to move and under constant pressure while playing because i have to be ready to lay down a wells at any point in time. i'm not questioning that you need to be sticky at your tag, but being responsible for the wells in combat puts it to a too high of a level, in my opinion and i find it at least off putting to not be able to get a sip of my drink or to clean up my inventory in peace for a second because i constantly have to be on standby.
---
second of all, it limits my builds because i sacrifice two whole utility slots. it's especially frustrating when the wells become redundant because some random wells were thrown on top of your's when the commander called for one. IF the commander called for one that is, because it may just as well happen, that the commander forgets to call for wells, which happens quite often, especially after the first one and the fight lasts long enough so your wells comes off cooldown during the fight but you don't know if you should just use one for a push or if the commander wants to hold on to it. and i dare you to take wells out for another skill, because, oh boy, you'll be in for constant whining and/or rage when you're one of the few mesmers in the squad and nobody is willing to lay down a wells when it's called. which results in a squad-kick at least and if you're unlucky, verbal abuse and more flame.
---
**TL;DR:** so, finally after all the rant, my idea: why not give commanders a special-action-key that comes with a starting cooldown when first tagging up that gives you a stack of wells? you could make it so that, as a commander, you get one stack for every 15 or so players in your squad and each stack gets its own cooldown, just like an ammo-system. i'm all for communication and coordination and those who do it best should outperform others but the mechanic of the wells feels unnecessarily restrictive and is a huge risk factor for toxicity, i think.
---

---
Looking good ! Really looking forward keyfarming in these environments !
---
...depends on the amount.
---
Really? I am at work so I thought the joke was only the patch note, and I was sad at the missed opportunity to stick in a fart joke on us. Sweet!
---
Was it really a physical giggle or just an outburst of warm air coming from your nose?
---
Killing the mobs/reflecting at the right time to avoid interruption is a *tall* order for 5 random players that might not know the path. You need at least 3 (hopefully including yourself) who know what's going on and have the ability to swap to a proper build to facilitate it. It's not *objectively* a lot of coordination but it's a lot *for random pugs*.
---
Some guilds have their own, but generally when folks want to host an open event I find they stick an announcement up on the subreddit.

Season 3 is decently farmed, but I wanna farm for the season 4 home instance nodes which need 10k Volatile Magic and was asking the best to do that :)

---
I take it the whoopee cushion chairs is the only thing actually in-game?
---
I may be wrong but I feel like it hits directly in front of the camera, so if you like to have the camera angled slightly above your character while you move you swing underneath the target and miss entirely.  If I directed it straight behind my character the hits seemed more consistent.
---
Woah. 
---
Stop worrying about rotations and just play. Understand the different skills and how they interact. Then practice optimizing skill sequences within the rotation. But try to learn to be adaptable. Your skill usage is gonna fluctuate with content and will never be the same between fights. So practice the fights. That's how you do it. Mechanics before DPS. You never wanna be on a fight staring at your hotbar trying to maximize DPS.
---
Also most importantly, paper and golem DPS belongs where it is. Not in content. Don't obsess over it. Let elitists be elitists.

Looks like you haven't been around during HoT's early days
---
Just came back, anyone know if the trains completing HoT zones still happen frequently?
---
If you don't have PoF, you won't be able to play it right now. But, it marks your account so you can when you do get the expansion.
---
:smiley:
---
&gt;How all the changes to unidentified gear feel to me.
---
Actually it's only one change.
---
However, no I need less than 30 inventory bags for HoT meta run (VB, TD, AB), so I have to clear my inventory maybe once a day. Therefor I don't mind cliking "use all" 4-5 times more.
---
Pretty often, they get spread out due to all the living world maps that have been included over time though 
---
My gathering nodes. . .NOOOOOOOOO
---
thank you
---
when its an april fools post and thief still gets nerfed. OOF
---
yes
---
Question's kind of vague (since you mentioned guaranteed unlock which could mean the 100% item you'll always get from a BL chest, but it can also mean the guaranteed item unlock item like the guaranteed wardrobe item). As such I'll answer both to be on the safe side.
---
If you mean the 100%  "you'll get this item" roll from the BL chests, then we don't know. The guaranteed item that comes from the BL changes whenever the BL chests themselves get updated contents, which could be anywhere from several weeks to several months between the current and the next.
---
If you mean the guaranteed wardrobe stuff, then that doesn't change since that pulls from your pool of skins that your account hasn't unlocked.
---
Leslie, you're thinking out loud again!
---

i remember the real first version of world 2 where the geyser used to disappear and not be static, that was the most brutal thing ever in that game
---
I am fully aware of the searing, and I don't endorse those means, it was heavy overkill.
---
I also don't support the siege of Orr, but both of these things were Flame Legion, the rest of the Charr only joined them for the promise of lost land retaken. I don't support what the flame legion did to make it happen. 
---
We are fighting against the flame legion aren't we? Righting our wrong of supporting them in the first place.

it's not yet past midday in the entire world though

For a small page like a lootbag, I'd go ahead and create the page all at once. For something like a living story chapter, I'd create the skeleton of the page, mark it as a stub, and work on one section at a time, rather than trying to create the whole page in one go.

Today I made someone on the internet chuckle. Mission accomplished.
---
I hear the "Fear not this night" tune when I wander around my home instance. Just for a few seconds each time I visit. No idea when it started doing that.
---
too tall debuff: can't use a mount for 3 minutes?
---

---
It functions similar to adrenaline but for the thief. Skills cost initiative
---
Looks like you havent been around during Wintersday 2014, which had the worst loot table of a festival container ever. You had containers that dropped other containers that gave you a choice between 2 different drops which were traded at vendor value (1c).
---
Ironically, those 2 drops were sigils of mischief and runes of snowfall (how things have changed...)
---
Saturday or Sunday you will almost certainly find one for the first three maps. Dragon's Stand tends to be separate, but runs regularly. 
---
There's a lot of body types not represented in the current presets. I'd like a boob and hip slider.
---
Also, seeing someone with a stick thin character with huge boobs is a good early indicator that you're potentially playing with either a creep or a twelve-year-old. There's some exceptions, but... generally it's a good tell. 
---
You and me both.
---
They're toggles in your account preferences, so if you wind up hating the newsletters with a passion, you can just turn them back off after you get your in-game reward.  No reason not to go ahead and sign up for all three.
---
You need PoF to play it, not unlock it.
---
Yea I figured it'd be a weekend. Thanks!
---
What was it?
---
oh no, it's probably an april fools joke :(
---
of course
---
I think any adventurer deserves small boobs. No one wants to lug large melons around all day and be forced to retire from adventuring because of severe back problems.
---
In ESO I feel like there's a lot more variety in character body types because of these sliders. Maybe some people would make an unrealistic character out of perversion, but I think the supermodel human female meta is partly because of the few available options. Most fatter character options look like pears, the thinner options have no curves at all. I just want strong legs and shoulders but small breasts but there really isn't anything like that. So now my character's cup size is larger than I'd like and her waist is a little too thin, but at least the rest is okayish. 
---
That, soldier, is a threat, and we're going to take it down!
---
You need PoF to unlock it.  I have a secondary Core account and it requires the purchase of PoF to unlock.
---
Pretty sure that it's much cheaper in fractals. Fractal dailies can also drop ascended salvage kits.
---
Don't let that stop you from trying wvw though, it's pretty fun.
---
Only applies to the current episode.  Past episodes need to be purchased, even if it's free.
---
Excellent info as I have no real concept of the rate that those currencies are gained.  Thanks!
---
I happened to replay this for achievements just last night and got the same bug. Just mount up on something other than the one you're stuck on and you will be free
---
IIRC CoH had a confuse effect that reversed your movement keys.
---
I could be mistaken, however, as it's been more than a few years. 
---
&gt; You can't ever make a kick system where it's not abused. 
---
As i said in my post, why not add a countdown timer so a player knows &amp; expects the kick a few seconds in advance? 
---
The side chest sounds like a very fair solution
---
OP is not proposing that Anet disallow commanders to kick unwanted squad members. He is suggesting they implement a system that prevents commanders from kicking players before they have had a chance to claim their loot.
---
You have a right to choose who you want in your squad, but you're a bit of a cunt if you kick players before they get their loot.
---
*I'll admit that I did this once myself*, as a commander doing W4. A guy joined and insisted that we let his friend join, who didn't have enough KP, but he said he would vouch for him.
---
We went through Cairn, his friend did less DPS than the chronos.
---
We went through MO, his friend did less DPS than the chronos.
---
But whatever, as long as we don't wipe, they can stay until Deimos. I guess.
---
Midway through Sama, I get a whisper...
---
&gt;Is X in your squad right now? And did he invite a 'friend'? He is a raid seller who sneaks his buyers into pug raids and lets the pugs carry them and keeps all the gold for himself.
---
This was before kicking a player mid-fight restarted the fight, so I just booted them immediately with no regrets. But I think I'd feel too bad to do it any other time.
---
&gt; Yeah there was no response 
---
Did you mention that you were unable to loot? Or ask if you could hop in, loot and then leave by your own?
---
Have i been 1 april trolled? All of those are unlocked for me and i havent paid a single gem
---
&gt; Pets commanded to fight members of their own species will instead turn hostile and attack the ranger.

&gt; I mean they could thank you

Why excactly would you thank someone for having low dps?

Did I get a Black Lion Key or did I get a Transmutation Charge?
---
I am 100% still a skill clicker. Never got the hang of movement and the number row with the same hand smoothly. 
---
It’s a very big table.
---
I know people would lose their minds over that EBG change, but I would like to see EBG treated like AV from WoW. A massive PvP zone with a whole slew of PvE elements that actually make a difference. Frogs or Ogres are a joke and need to be re-vamped to have real power.
---
To be honest, some of these are solid ideas and would make fun gameplay.
---
We used to be automatically dismounted in betas.
---
Because they contributed to the kill. You're not thanking them for the low DPS, you're thanking them for what they *did* provide. It doesn't matter how low their DPS was (especially considering they were filling a role they were ASKED to fill, not the role they originally signed up for) -- they participated in the raid, they did damage on the boss, they provided buffs, etc.
---
Maybe they didn't have the best DPS, maybe you would prefer to replace them for the next boss -- that's fine and understandable -- but when someone helps you do something, you owe them at least some basic courtesy (and the loot they earned!).
---
It blows my mind that someone would actually question this. If you want to replace someone, that's totally fine, but you don't just *default* to being a jerk about it. It's not that hard to say "Hey thanks for contributing, but I think this next boss is going to need a BS who can bring some more DPS to the table if we're going to have a successful kill. Did you get your loot?"
---
It doesn't hurt you to be polite for five seconds.
---
I'm so happy you didn't do that. :'D
---
If you got warnings for it, there was probably something wrong with the way you presented it. 
---
Graveyard: exactly where the project will be tomorrow.
---
This one just killed me xD
---
(pun wasn't intended)
---
Huh, that is similar actually.
---
Those were all in GW1 for what it's worth.
---
Other than SAB and the chair update last year, GW2 only had bobble head and airplane. Both are now gem store toys.
---
SB/DT is actually more dps then SB/SB i'd say that double SB is better in situations where u cant have the boss stay on your fields and the rotation is easier too but on golem and probably most bosses SB/DT is better.
---
You can but dps isn't really that telling in a wvw fight, but it will give you visibility to the dmg you're doing currently compared with other people playing that class doing the same thing. You'd be able to kinda see that you may be lagging behind them in numbers. Practicing on your positioning relative to the tag will also help boost your damage numbers, or making sure to bomb where and when the commander wants that way you're likely bombing while people are caught on cc. Lastly make sure you have a good idea of a general rotation or at least what to use and when to use it so you are playing optimally. Work towards the build your guild is running but make sure you know why you're equipping what you are first otherwise you'll just be a freshly geared rally bot.  
---
you might still be able do claim your rewards IL you go into the wing again 
---
Dammit! Some of those WvW 'updates' sound really cool. Want!
---
Boon thief
---
Can't get Tyria Masteries without at least 1 expansion.
---
so to recap:
---
you never "got around" acquiring arguably the most important of core tyria masteries? the best one by far?
---
your proposed solution would be amazing in..your very niche/specific scenario that only yourself and probably 2-3 other players might run into
---
why not give a timer? as entertaining as an all caps final message might be from upset people..it would be quite disruptive to see 3-4 of those timers tick down at the same time while angry "yelling" happens
---
as for the other suggestions like a majority vote, thankfully a squad isn't a democracy! it's the price we pay for having a semblance of organization..groups would otherwise devolve into some reenactment of 12 angry men lol
---
the vote kick already creates unnecessary drama (sometimes) in fractal runs, with people being split on their decisions and starting arguments and taking sides
---
**tl;dr** unlucky situation but very rare and the proposed solutions are silly
---
OMG! TY!!  😍
---
&gt; Because they contributed to the kill. You're not thanking them for the low DPS, you're thanking them for what they *did* provide. It doesn't matter how low their DPS was (especially considering they were filling a role they were ASKED to fill, not the role they originally signed up for) 
---
Do you really think it doesn't matter how low the DPS is in order to determine how much people contributed?
---
Also for me it doesn't sound like OP told the commander he is not comfortable on BS. He basically said "meh I'm bad at BS but the others are good enough to carry me." in his second sentence.
---
&gt; they participated in the raid, they did damage on the boss, they provided buffs 
---
BS is giving his boons passivly and by pressing 2 buttons every 60 seconds. 
---
Am I supposed to thank every experienced raider because he is able to autoattack and press 2 buttons in a 60 second interval?
---
&gt; you owe them at least some basic courtesy (and the loot they earned!). 
---
I don't see me saying anything about him not deserving his loot. But if you start writing an essay to everyone who underperforms in pugs you'll be stuck for 4 hours each wing.
---
I'd rather see two hand axes Tbh. Plus there's already a focus that's a fan just like that. Closes when not equipped and fnas out when it is. 
---
&gt; Thank them for taking the time to raid with you 
---
Having to kick someone in the middle of a wing because he underperforms costs you more time than having a player performing on the group average from the start. 
---
&gt; Do you not thank folks at job interviews? 
---
Staying in that analogy, would you thank someone faking his experience, showing he doesn't deliver what he's supposed to do later? Making you start the whole process again and look for a new person to replace him? Yeah, didn't think so.
---
I am on US servers and will be on tonight. Happy to help you get to Jahai Bluffs. 
---
Bottom right corner of Vabbi, behind the Vineyard.
---
It *should* be marked with a green star on your map.
---
As a scourge you shouldn't primarily focus on doing damage because there's better classes for that. Your main goal is corrupting boons and, luckily, Arcdps addon can also show that.
---
&gt;"Hey thanks for contributing, but I think this next boss is going to need a BS who can bring some more DPS to the table if we're going to have a successful kill. Did you get your loot?"
---
...
---
Just fully unlocked chrono. Spamming wells is a good start right?
---
Who do I vote for, they all look the same
---
&gt; your very niche/specific scenario that only yourself and probably 2-3 other players might run into 
---
This doesn't address the problem at all. The issue is that it **can** be done to anyone.
---
Huge exaggeration coming up: Your argument is the equivalent to saying its okay to make murder legal, as long as it doesn't happen frequently to the majority of people.
---
The simple fact that it can happen at any time, utilizing the given systems in the game designed to maintain order &amp; balance, without any real punishment, **is** a flaw.
---
It's okay if you don't agree with my solution, and it's okay if you think i'm over exaggerating &amp; don't think it's a big enough to mention or address... But don't pretend like the system is perfect, it's disingenuous.. 
---
&gt; as entertaining as an all caps final message might be from upset people..it would be quite disruptive to see 3-4 of those timers tick down at the same time while angry "yelling" happens 
---
How is it any more disruptive than getting whispers afterwards?
---
And even if there is angry yelling, it would last like 5 seconds.... I'm assuming you're an adult, i'm sure you can deal with it
---
Most groups spend quite a bit longer than 5-10 seconds taking a breather between wipes anyways
---
&gt; groups would otherwise devolve into some reenactment of 12 angry men lol 
---
12 angry men wasn't a democratic vote btw
---
Criminal jury's are based on a "without reasonable doubt" foundation, meaning only 1 of the 12 jury needs to vote against it for it to fail.
---
&gt; **tl;dr** unlucky situation but very rare and the proposed solutions are silly 
---
Would you say the same about the loop hole in the law that caused you and your family to lose money? or would you point it out &amp; advocate a fix?
---
I thought it was reportable as "LFG Abuse", but it's never happened to me so I've never cared to double check.
---
You should vote for the asuran (:
---
Thank you! I acccept the help!
---
sooo  5 ppl or commander dont wana you in party aaand you wana report what exactly?
---
Jump in and surprise yourself
---
The repeating part is the joke, no need to have the number be exactly the same
---
Oh no, two full sentences that give someone a clear understanding of why they were kicked. Would you rather see that, or a giant wall of text complaining/questioning why they were kicked?(see OP)
---
FFS, even just say "low dps" before kicking. Don't leave someone confused.
---
Likely this event in Harathi.  You kill a giant, then go into centaur territory through a destroyable wall.

---
you're right! I just checked the Hero pahe and I'm in Lion's Arch to continue 'My Story', the fourth chapter! duh! 
---
That guy was a douche and he could’ve just ask you to leave after twisted castle since that encounter doesn’t require much.  
---
Anet should do something similar to WoW and just mail us the loot if we don’t manage to pick it up on spot (would be useful in WvW too).
---
Because they ignored your whispers, you saw them in LFG and you have a DPS meter. Not everyone who gets kicked gets those extra bits of info.
---
there's a bunch of different proofs. Here's one of the simplest:
---
1/3 = 0.333... 
---
3\*(1/3) = 3\*(0.333...)
---
3/3 = .999...
---
1 = .999...
---
This has the least magic to it, and maybe even seems too simple, but I think it can also provide the most insight into what this tells us about number systems. .999... and 1 aren't different numbers that happen to be equal, they're different representations of the same number.
---
When we deal with fractions, plenty of numbers are unable be properly represented as base 10 numbers. 1/10 is very easy to represent as .1 in base 10, but becomes .002200220022... in base 3. Similarly 1/3 is .1 in base 3 and infinitely repeating in base 10.
---
So in summary, repeating numbers are often used to represent fractions that don't natively fit into the numerical system being used. That means they produce oddities. Numbers having multiple representations is not unusual (1 = 1.0 = 1.000, etc), this is just a example that doesn't make intuitive sense.
---
&gt; Anet should do something similar to WoW and just mail us the loot if we don’t manage to pick it up on spot (would be useful in WvW too). 
---
Seems like a good fix,
---
Or it could just be added as a chest on the bottom right, above the mini map, like tons of other reward chests.
---
As i said in my post, there's **tons** of easy solutions to the problem.
---
People who use (: instead of :) are from the Mirror World and should be avoided at all costs. 
---
Typical programmer.
---
If you go into raids without a dps meter you can just assume you got kicked because of low dps and will be correct 99% of the time.
---
Rez scourge with epi maybe?
---
By all Six Gods, what is that thing? It's huge!
---
Yeah i guess so, there's a lot of potential fixes for it though, since some people are against the countdown timer on kick idea.... Why can't anet do something much simpler like give the rewards in a mini clickable chest above your mini map?
---
The combination of the chest / instant-kick overall feels pretty bad.
---
I go out of my way to do Fractals at every tier to maintain a balanced perspective; I play all sorts of support &amp; DPS classes.  
---
&gt; If you were legitimately a fractal god then you would know that even though burning is one of the burstier conditions, it still does not come anywhere close to a proper burst rotation from a power dps class in fractals.
---
This is true *when* people can play classes like DH, Weaver, Holosmith or Soulbeast correctly.  **Unfortunately, many, even at the T4 level cannot.**  In fact, your inability to push 18-20, 23k? on cFirebrand should speak volumes about global inability to grasp skill priority and rotations.  Perhaps, look in the mirror? Your struggles with Firebrand reflect bottlenecks in the skill distribution of the game.  It's not uncommon, nor is it worth getting defensive about and calling someone...?
---
Oh right.  
---
&gt; I'm a cunt, and an arrogant unlikable shithead because I raid and do CM Fractals.  
---
... because, what? because I'm telling you things that you're not ready to hear? Because you aren't willing to relate or think for yourself?  It's not that people that underperform are bad players.  They're just unpracticed and haven't figured out how to abuse their traits, skills and boons to deal competent damage **or are not willing to.**  It's GW2 in a nutshell, really. I don't consider myself an amazing player, but most people really have no idea where their DPS comes from, and you're a prime example, whether you like it or not. 
---
Usually I never see whoever takes me out until it's too late.  And changing skills fast on the fly....not sure how I can do that when they are charging at me.  Hopefully it's just due to my inexperience
