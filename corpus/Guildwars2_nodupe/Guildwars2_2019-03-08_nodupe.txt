...where did you find that.
---
---
---
TBH I'm a little bothered that over half of these are holiday/ seasonal themed. 
---
But mounts scale with bodysize. You can have small charr and your mount will be actually smaller than big asura's one.
---
Is that the new 2000 gem skin?? How’d you unlock it so early!
---
Unfortunately, I'm pretty sure that most people won't recognize it as a natural name, because "Iget" is pretty obscure, and the "joke" name is super obvious.
---

---
I've seen some pretty funny keyfarm names over the years, though. There's one almost ever week that makes me laugh.
---
people need to stop playing glass builds and start building more defensively.  half the issue right now is too many down instantly on engage.
---
Wouldn't choking off reinforcements to a siege be considered sound strategy for taking the objective even if it results in shitty fights? Being from the uninvolved server I'll grant you is kinda dirty - but war is war is it not?
---
While I agree that pick/burst builds are different than roaming, I still see some value in it (to disrupt enemy reinforcements) on a conceptual level. How it actually plays out is pretty much awful because the people they're picking off have builds that are meant to be played in a large group and can't really handle a 1v1 or burst reliably.
---
The good thing about the Ballista stuff though is that they stick out and are easily identified (assuming you have name plates enabled). I haven't been targeted by one yet but I imagine you can evade frame the shots so that should help it be a bit more manageable.
---
Mobility is a tricky thing to balance in pvp, let alone in a game mode with huge maps and space for many styles of play (solo, small group, havoc/ktrain, zerg). I think that the mounts are more in favor of large scale group play, but I'm worried we won't have the population to sustain that in the long run.
---
Having Pounce dismount other players could be a way to address that I guess? Force both players to potentially dismount if it lands, forces the aggressor to dismount and lets the other escape if it whiffs/evades.
---
This, so much this.
---
1080.
---
1-2seconds of cripple is too much, lol

Finish the Mistward stuff. &gt;.&gt;
---
I've got local drives at R. 
---
You haven't seen a dolphin with breasts, have you?
---
Yeah, I just doubt Anet will bring that back :/
---
Beautiful
---
It's fun and makes the game mode more mobile. Unfortunately, it also causes problems on the metagame level (detailed in many great posts on this sub) that need to be addressed or it'll become another sore point after the honeymoon period is over. 
---
I haven't asked them yet. 
---
&gt; Terrible for small scale or roamers
---
I understand the role of a roamer but lets not pretend the majority of them aren't a cancer. Their build is 100% tailored for 1v1 and mobility. Even if you somehow win they will *instantly* begin to run with insane mobility and get away. Anything that knocks roamers down is a win to me.
---
Scrapper changes are delicious honestly. In WvW at least its pretty fun, that sneak gyro is really cool
---
What do you want to get in to is a factor to most answers. PvP , fractals and raids , WvW or open world.
---
Open world anything could work as long as you synergize your traits and play accordingly. 
---
\*places banner on back\*
---
with every day of this month having a new sale (and if you're not in a hurry), living story episode(s) may go on sale.
---
Its kit makes it seem like a pretty good utility healer, I was just checking the traits yesterday and I liked what I saw.
---
Is it safe to stand my ground WHILE I shit my pants? 😂
---
Really? Cuz high ranked ppl seem to disagre, and Scrapper support is strong. The problem is that is oushined by Firebrand. Same reason Tempest support doesnt see much play, cuz of Firebrand
---
They have a lot of work ahead but with the recent changes Scrapper should be in a good spot, honestly it just feels most ppl dont like the spec and Holo seems also a lot more fun to play vs Scrapper
---
The ticket is with me. I have not yet had time to review it, however, at first glance I cannot give much hope, I have not seen any errors made by the team. I'll give more info once I have had time to actually do anything with the ticket.
---
you're comparing an elite spec and an entire class though..can't you see how wrong that is?
---
necro is afk solo king maybe..other classes can perform better alone such as thief or ranger, you just have to not be asleep while playing them
---
Nah, just means open the gate in dutch lol.
---
ah, i see
---
The game is NOT GPU-bound, your CPU's single core performance matters much more as the game doesn't utilize multiple cores well. 
---
They chain bounce to targets around them. 
---
had a commander earlier who would wait for everyone to group up, go "alright, lets go" then hop on a warclaw and just ghost the zerg.  It was fun
---
will do! Thanks!

Part 6 - Renamed new mount the Snoreclaw
---
Notice How easily  I dismantled that warclaw at the end too
---
Blueprints have a price and are not moveable. Once you put them down you have commited to that position. If you would increase the mount damage to a point where 3 mounts could do "a good amount of damage" as you said(which I would see as 40%-50% damage done to the gate) then it is also strong against t2 and t3 gates. But the mounts have the advantage of quick setup and quick escape if needed and they can even change gates very fast during an attack.  
---
With 3 full groups you could easily attack 3 gates at once on a keep(3 mounts attacking gates and 2 players guarding the mounts/killing guards/scouting for appproaching enemies). If mounts could do decent damage with their attack this type of strategy could quickly and repeatedly drain supplies from a keep. Especially if they capture the supporting camps or kill the doylaks in between. And the only thing they have to "invest" is supplies.
---
Git gud. It's not hard to counter.. think of it as a necro, kite out the hard hitting skills, condi it to death. If you're using a power based melee obviously you'll have a rough time. The new gyros follow the player now.
---
Right now, it gives you a meaningful advantage and that makes WvW 
---
a bit more daunting for newcomers. 
---
I found it useful to master when to pounce when you're running Spellbreaker, as it gets you in to drop winds a bit easier. However, that all depends on how your group is playing vs enemy group. 
---
Sandswept Isle meta finnaly fixed. That was quick fix! I am happy now.
---
i misplace my leg bifrost, dunno what happen maybe i deleted it, i told them i have proof i have it coz i have skin unlock but support said they dont restore legendary? but w/e hope u get urs resolve, i swear anet support is a hit and miss.
---
Wow you sound convincing, do you command? How about a self intro first so we'll decide to actually listen to you.
---
Is the leap nerf temporary, or the "solution" because nerfing the mount would basically make it worthless depending on the distant reduced..
---
Right?! Woooot 
---
Totally agree. I figured knockbacks would dismount. Little did I see they do not. 
---
If nothing changes, roaming as I see it is dead. 
---
I feel like this whole thing of us being a commander that has to save the world is going too far, they've jumped the shark long ago and they keep on going with our player character being the ultimate hero and i dont know how it will end.
---
Where do you go from being a dragon slaying god killer whom even death can't stop? I personally don't like it but change in story or focus shift is impossible at this point
---
Any pver will share the sentiment. All I care is it looks nice lool
---
You can max out gw2 graphically with acceptable frames without a top tier gpu, on the cpu side of things it's totally different story
---
Honestly jealous of that glider skin, cool find all the same 
---
Still doesn't fix a lot of the exploits
---
An in-game mail like that is probably an account-wide one (like the stuff you get from gem store, which will show up in the mailbox of every character you have), so that may be why you happened to see it on another character, not because they sent it to the "wrong" character.
---
I'm sorry you're having this trouble with your legendary though. Just keep at it, try not to lose your cool when dealing with the (admittedly annoying) process, and hopefully eventually it will be escalated to someone who recognizes the problem.
---
How much of a difference is it?
---
There won't ever be new dungeons, instead we only get half-assed uninspired fractals with unskippable boring dialogues
---
reminds me of "fixing" perma stealth builds with stealth trap... instead of fixing the issue, lets add siege shit that wont even work most of the time
---
I was willing to settle for invisible walls at tactical locations, and a cartoony "SPLAT!" sound effect if your mount hit them, but I guess this is a good fix too.
---
Some popular choices 
---
-  achievement hunting
---
-  work toward top tier fractals 
---
-  join guild (or five of them) and partake in training raids
---
-  HoT and PoF stories
---
-  Try out WvW and PvP 
---
To OP, and everyone else below fighting. Ben never says: don't post on reddit. He said his preference is we PM him, because THAT is easier for him to see (instead of checking reddit). I am 99% sure his intention was not to stop any of us posting these in reddit.
---
Having said that, it would be your call what you do with your content afterall, within the subreddit rules as you said. 
---
Keep in mind that Guild Wars 2 is very open when it comes to end game. You have to choose what you want to do. There is nothing that you "have to do". That's the beauty of the game. Some people become hardcore raiders, others become roleplayers, I know people who do nothing but making gold on the trading post, some people are just after fashion and buy all the fancy skins to make their character look good. Have you ever seen people with shiny particle effects around them or people leaving footfalls behind them? Those are (sometimes) quite expensive infusions and legendary weapons which people farm for for a long time. That's just the tip of the iceberg. There are many more things to do. I know people who speedrun dungeons or try to get the fastest times on griffon adventures (if you've ever seen them) or races.
---
You said that you have played Heart of Thorns (hot) and Path of Fire (pof), right? There are living world episodes that feature stories inbetween expansions. So far we have living world season 2 (LS2, before hot), LS3 (between hot and pof) and LS4 (after pof). Season 3 and Season 4 feature exclusive maps, achievements, skins, story, etc. and can be unlocked for 200gems each in the gemstore (~60-70g, right now prices are a bit higher because of march sales). Of course, you can also buy these with real money.
---
If you are lost regarding the acquisition of items, I highly recommend the Guild Wars 2 wiki
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Main_Page
---
You can also get there by typing "/wiki" into the game chat bar. You can also search for specific items, spells, npcs, etc. using "/wiki [item name]" (without the brackets). You can also type "\wiki " and then ping the item/spell/whatever by holding shift and left clicking the item i believe (check your keybind settings). The wiki holds LOTS of information. If you don't know how to get one item just look it up there.
---
Anyway, regarding content, you seem to be interested in fractals and raids. Are you familiar with Agony resistance (read the wiki article on it if you want to learn more)? You will need this for higher tier fractals. And to answer your question, yes, exotic gear is fine for raids. Ascended is better, of course, but trust me, the gear is not what's going to hold you back in the beginning. 5 % more dps won't prevent you from wiping to a mechanic. There are plenty of experienced raiders who raid in exotic gear on their alt accounts, heck, sometimes people from my static raiding group forget to equip trinkets at all and we still clear fine. 
---
There’s no recurring subscription fee for GW2, never has been. Just buy the game and play it without any other mandatory costs. There are optional things you can buy in the gem store, some of which are purely aesthetics (skins) and others of which add some convenience factor (infinite gathering tools, unlimited salvage tools, etc) but nothing that will improve your power in combat (eg, no pay-to-win items).
---
Yea I noticed the same thing 
---
Boon strip and condis are good counters though 
---
*Twitter
---
Fairly new player here, i am looking for some ranged dps class &amp; build. Mainly looking to do open world, low ish fractals, dungeons. What would you suggest for me to try?
---
Depends on the build and game mode, if you want something easy to gear I would suggest power DPS with berserker stats. You can buy [cheap exotic gear](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Nika%27s_armor) off the trading post. As for weapons I would suggest greatsword and sword/axe or longbow. You can get a [good idea of builds here](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Ranger) specifically this build for [open world base ranger](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Ranger_-_Longbow_Beastmastery). Would also suggest [this guide for gearing](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character).
---
&gt; Any spellbreaker build for PvE you have can be immediately improved by removing spellbreaker and replacing it with core.
---
Sorry I'm just talking about a raid record. I'm sure you didn't say that ANY spellbreaker build could be improved, I'm sure you were nuanced and said that "almost any." Oh wait, you didn't. You made an assertion that immediately got proven wrong.
---
I called mine This Clown once.
---
You beat the game. Now you can farm and craft. 
---
I was looking for outfits that are different on male and female asura. That outfit is the same for both.
---
O.. Oh nvm then
---
Most builds deal more damage in melee and want to be stacked with the group anyways for organised PvE content like fractals or raids. Fractals prefer having power damage and you can see [meta builds here](https://discretize.eu/builds). I would say your best option would be dragonhunter with range being on scepter. If you don't mind using a different weapon in open world deadeye (rifle) o soulbeast (longbow) would work as well but you wouldn't want the weapons in fractals later on.
---
so I forgot the name of the **_Tauren_** and now I'm laughing at "cowfolk" here.
---
You may be retarded, but don't despair: god loves each one of his little creatures.
---
Oh wait, are you a bot? Or are you just angry? These are NPC-level insults.

---
I mean, that's all your doing. You're so triggered right now you can't even come up with a rational response.
---
Lmaaao
---
The dismount hop alone is a huge thing you can abuse, especially as a mesmer. I'm pretty sure all of the jump spots can still be abused by certain professions, though that's technically less problematic than having literally everyone able to.
---
Except it no longer gives reliable stab. Which is the main reason it was used.
---
Fixed now?

Prodding the mentally ill for laughs, while fun, is unethical, so I will depart and leave you be.

---
ArcDPS breaks almost every patch. It's just something you need to get used to it you're going to use it.
---
Yea I've had it for a while, but it's never disappeared altogether before, also GW2Hook doesn't work now as well at the same time so it's a separate issue
---
It's not even been 1 week yet... Give it time.
---
Sweet, been using my firebrand more for its versatility but i'll try to focus on its condy
---
Thanks!
---
What part of "Giant crossbow shoots homing electrified bouncy nets" don't you get?
---
Spellbreaker was a "PvP-only" spec too, but they made it useful enough to be worth taking.
---
Stealth caps at 5 stacks not at a fixed time.
---
No one uses soldier in wvw anyway. It’s really not been a thing for years. 
---
No, it was clearly designed for PvP. Look at the function gyro alone -- its primary benefit is found in competitive game modes, not PvE. Then look at the other gyros (pre this week's patch) and tell me they aren't designed with pvp in mind. Sneak gyro has very little use in PvE, purge useless outside PvP, shredders always been worthless, blast gyro is really weak in PvE, heal gyro was just inferior to heal turret, and bulwark gyro was the only gyro worth using in PvE.
---
You can wait a bit until the meta stabilizes after the recent balance patch. Assuming nothing changes, then in WvW your options are: Tempest and Scrapper for zerg (big group) builds; Holosmith and Soulbeast for roaming (small group/solo) builds. Almost anything flies in dungeons. And like the other guy said, open world doesn't matter. 
---
I am so sick of these things everyone that has a test server ignores the players to much.
---
Does it still work after the patch?
---
i mean is really protection holo that much more entertaining to play against?
---
cuz they're kinda the same build overall
---
the only annoying thing is when they pop out of stealth without any warning..luckily they deal 0 damage so it doesn't actually matter but you could get ganked by a more dps-oriented build i guess
---
Hey guys, I'm a new player doing the personal story, and I'm a bit confused. 1-30 was pretty simple, but I just started the lv40 quest and I'm completely lost. What's Destiny's Edge, and when did my character learn about it? Is it a GW1 legacy group? I haven't done the dungeons yet, so is that where they're introduced?
---
And when were elder dragons explained in the game? I googled them so I have a vague idea what they are (didn't want to read too much because spoilers) but I don't think the game explained them, did it?
---
If there is anything I can do to expedite or provide any additional proof that I once owned these legendaries before my hiatus from the game, I'll do whatever I can. 
---
I appreciate you looking into the issue, and I fully intend to cooperate anyway I can. I worked really hard on these legendaries back in 2013, and I'd really love to have them back!
---
Jokes aside, there are no lies here. Back in 2013, it was a feat to make even one legendary, and I managed two before I quit. Regardless of how others view it these days, I consider it a high achievement for my account, personally. It's no different than my 50/50 HoM or my GWAMM.
---
Thanks for the encouragement! I've been incredibly level-headed as I can be, even though it's been very very stressful!
---
&gt; Do scout, guerrilla teams and tactical units not exist in all facets of warfare?
---
You know what doesn't exist in warfare? Waypoints and limited playtime. Getting back to the zerg in the game shouldn't mean waiting half an hour for a new reinforcement platoon to form and be sent out, especially if there's no build templates feature that would let you insta-retrait to an anti-ganking self-sustainable build.
---
This is the dumbest thing I've read all day.
---
Just completed the silverwastes track and it does indeed give another warclaw box instead of the Carapace armor box.  Kind of a bummer but oh well.
---
Destiny Edge was first mentioned at that story. They were a group of heroes that was created before the events of Guild Wars 2 (Not in Guild Wars 1, that is several hundreds years before Guild Wars 2).  They tried to take down an Elder Dragon, but failed. Hence their reaction at the story. What actually happened will be explained as you progress the Story. 
---
Elder dragons are actually mentioned early in the game with Zhaitan , Primordius by the Asura, Jormag by the Norn, Krakaltorik by the Char, but not much more information. As you played the personal story, their details will be further explained. This extend to all Living Seasons Episodes too.
---
Thank you! I was thinking they might be trickling the story, but the player character seems awfully familiar with what happened and how it all fits together, so it felt weird that I was clueless.
---
im just glad that spam counter aka SB was nerfed to the ground,so ppl can again spam their shit without interuptions.
---
All the comments below are hilarious, being able to solo a lord has nothing to do with stealth / thieves. Any ranged class can kite a lord solo. Thief has a rifle, go figure.
---
I actually agree they don’t scale enough. I used a makeover kit to make my charr a little smaller thinking he would fit his mount better but now he just looks HUGE compared to the mount which is now even smaller. At about 75% character size/height is the best I’ve found so far. 
---
Runescape? :-)
---
you  can get three. silverwastes PvP track reward was also replaced with Wardle chest
---
What is SW? 
---
The other day I thought hamstrung birds avenger was worse enough haha
---
&gt; I've been around online gaming since 1999 and i can tell you no MMO can survive without expansions.
---
Sounds like you've played like one MMO since 1999, then. Only 2 of the 6 MMOs I play even have expansions, this one and World of Warcraft, which I haven't played in quite some time.
---
Thank you, that makes a lot more sense as to why we went to Lion's Arch in the first place. Weird that the player character went from asking basic questions about Destiny's Edge being an expert and placing a lot of trust in the group in 10 levels.
---
Silverwastes. A core tyria map next to Brisbane wildlands
---
I really like the Elonian elementalist outfit, I think we need more like it.
---
This is the main reason why the warclaw is a complete joke. 
---
It doesn't add anything to gameplay. Give it 2 / 3 months and we will be back down to pre WvW mount population levels.
---
I am a spirit god. That's the feeling.
---
Infinite duration cuz u can teleport them, spam skills and heal them do they won't go away. Not sure of the teleport distance yet and need more tests to try different terrain and elevation but so far it's great!
---
"NO MORE putting out effort" = current and future of WvW
---
This seems obvious to most people, but like an idiot I struggled with it for weeks before realizing it was the source of my framerate problem:
---
The arcdps boon table eats a fuckton of frames if you keep it open while in combat. Eats basically no frames when out of combat. Keep it closed until you're ooc.
---
Also seemingly obvious, in order of biggest impact to least impact:
---
- Character Model Limit: lowest (medium+ in raids)
---
- Character Model Quality: lowest (any higher and it'll still load other people's skins, only lowest replaces with generic models)
---
- Shadows: low/none
---
- Shaders: low
---
Thank you!
---
Logged in the other day, got into 3 games BACK TO BACK agaisnt 1-2 scrappers on the enemy team (we only had one in game 3) and basically the game became; who can get the scrapper on a capped point and end all possible interactions with that node for the rest of the match.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'm glad that Anet is looking into bringing some HoT speccs back, and they did some very minor changes to Tempest, but they got nowhere near viable in PvP yet. If you went to the official forums, people who are knowledgeable on their respective classes called that scrapper would become an issue, and that tempest needed, many, MANY more buffs to even come close to viable in the current state of the game. Im not surprised at this outcome. I expect ranked will now be mostly ~~soulbeasts~~ scrappers on both sides and it will be a snore fest, where the team with the fewer of them or without a cap, will slowly, VERY slowly be bled out of the match.
---
Worst part? We all know we wont see another patch in 4-6 months, so get used to the new meta, oh, and staff/scepter mirage is still as cancerous as ever.
---
That was a fun time. I miss the cyclone of rewards...
---
Yes, this is why I am so frustrated about it. Regardless if there is proof from their tools that I acquired or lost it (because it was back in 2013...), I still have the skins (legendary and precursor) and achievement progress! &gt;_&lt;
---
I get over that in wvwvw blobs with a year and a half old i7.

I just got the warclaw, and I'm honestly not sure why I did. It's like every other mount but worse. I guess I'll have to really get into wvw now so it'll actually be useful.
---
It's always going to be some spec in any MMORPG. Machinist in FF14, Scrapper in GW2 or Marksman Hunter in WoW....shit starting to notice if you use a gun, you're screwed. That's just how it is. I'm convinced that the devs throw a dart and whatever spec/class it lands on they choose to ignore for 5 years.
---
That wouldn't be much of a mount, they move slower than characters walking. 
---
Every game needs balance.
---
Here's the thing. They spent a whole lot of time developing this mount as a way to get people excited for WvW. Now, everyone complains about the different ways it's broken or overpowered, which it is... so already Anet have started nerfing it. If they don't keep nerfing it to fix more problems, those problems will remain. If they do keep nerfing it, then we'll be left with an extremely lacklustre mount that's no fun and doesn't get people excited, which was the whole point in the first place. 
---
I’m not against the mount. I’m against the people who say 1v1 builds are cancer. How’s that?
---
I remember Cele Engi being hugely powerful with slick shoes abuse for a while. Basically CC someone near permanently by running over them repeatedly lmao
---
Tybalt had both of his arms, just his right hand was severely damaged. Which is also not the case for this imposter!
---
So we spent all this time to get warclaw, hyped up to use it and it just gets nerfed twice in the first week. 
---
-Reduced the maximum number of targets on the warclaw’s Battle Maul skill from 10 to 3. Reduced the damage of Battle Maul by 26% in WvW.
---
-Reduced the distance the warclaw travels when using the Leap Forward mount action.
---
Fuck You Anet
---
Nah doubt it will be as much, its a bigger area and it doesnt have access to the fractals stuff I think so most PvErs that have the inumerous infutions on their chars to make them look like lighthouses shouldn't be there as much
---
I only got back to WvW now after playing it a lot at release and I might buy the pass seeing how beautiful the area is in other videos
---
Make sense. Or fuck off.
---
The official forums are a cesspool of hypocrisy, where dissenting opinions are silenced by moderators who would rather push their own narrative than engage in a debate about legitimate issues in the game,  you say? I'm shocked! 
---
Your mistake was cloning an original post already on the forum which indicates trolling. Fair, next. Refine your methods and try again another day. 
---
How tough is it to get? I kinda want one but I also don't want to contribute to the problem of PvE jagoffs invading someone else's game mode just to get an armored cat. I had enough of that grinding out gifts for my legendaries
---
Don't make statements like "I can only guess you never worked as a QA" if you don't want a comment stating that you know nothing about me.
---
That's not the way that the processes in big companies work. Why would QA know anything about bugs that people have logged regarding jumps. The bug will get logged. Someone will investigate and determine the existence and severity of the bug. Sometimes that is someone from QA but most times it isn't. It will then get assigned a priority and put in a queue. Most times, the first time QA would hear about it is when a developer has fixed the bug and it has been assigned to QA to verify that the bug was fixed. It may be common knowledge in the WvW community but that has nothing to do with it being common knowledge in the QA.

In my head canon they are all sentient humanoid reptiles in wigs, as in GW1 they were almost all bald.
---
I know this is wrong but I choose to believe it.

The look of shock is apparent O:

I also knows some WVWs who use "strategic cosmetics" for combat so I'm praying for more than you're expecting at least

Can I legally change my name to living document?

As an IT person, stop using network drives!

Use network locations instead.

Rotating mini map  😂

Gotcha, thanks for the explanation.

As a warrior I don't mind fighting scrappers. Pretty easy to beat as long as I don't make a big mistake.
---
I doubt the mods even realized it was a clone.
---
Thanks, I'm going with Cobalt for now but Fused looks interesting. I see from your response that you're not really into flames, but my character has this dark look (all black dye armor) with his torch + scepter both with pretty cool flames wielded and I wanted a greatsword to go with this look, I had primordus but it didn't look right to me and Volcanus was so cool. Anyway, ty for your response! 
---
I just have mine in bin64, along with a d3d9_chainload.dll file to load gw2hook using the name Reshade64.dll instead.
---
cause ppl just run away? havoc groups who spec into mobility to chase people down and force an encounter that's favorable to them now have less opportunities.

50 days is *almost* 2 months.  It is far from 4 months and absolutely nowhere close to 6 months.  There are plenty of reasons to be frustrated with Anet, but don't just make shit up so you can sound edgy.
---
I wouldn't be so close of that Flerken ...
---
99.99% of PvE content does not have boons on enemies which instantly makes the majority of spellbreaker's kit pointless.
---
Spellbreaker's weapons are focused around 1v1, which is also a small part of PvE content, spellbreaker's entire kit focuses on isolating and chasing single targets (immobilize on stun, a lot of superspeed, leaps, taunts, ect) which you have no reason to ever use on PvE and his abilities are focused around specialized PvP scenairios, like apply reveal and do a single crit on your next strike, yes that will help in PvE, or strip 2 boons and do shitty damage on 15 second cooldown, you could literally make this do nothing in PvE and nobody would notice the difference.
---
From top to bottom, spellbreaker is a drag on the rest of warrior.
---
Am I the only one that just wants different armor pieces?
---
Didn't even realize this patch would kill pChrono again... not the danger time changes, but SoE.
---
Totally this...it's cool. I think WvW has always been about team fights...you'll get to tangle with that guy...when you're in your zerg. 
---

From top to bottom, spellbreaker is a drag on the rest of warrior in PvE content. Half his abilities are non applicable, and the other half half functionality that doesn't work on mobs same way it does on players.
---
Out of curiosity after reviewing her video what concerns are there of her story not being legitimate? I know it's possible for specific items to be generated / provided, because I recall many years ago a specific individual had "dupes" of legendaries from CS. I understand why there has to be protocol for ensuring that no mistakes are made.
---
I just can't really think of the possibility of there being any deception here. As long as they could be generated in account bound form, ofc. That's the only problem I could see, because if she were to be given both legendaries in tradable form she could potentially just turn around and sell them instead.
---
Instead of having a reasonable discussion, all you can say is "you're bad". How do you know how I play? I mentioned the thief because that is something that stuck in my mind while trying out different builds and professions. I couldn't get the lay down a field, dodge through it, dodge back through it, story working. I was probably doing it wrong but I didn't get any stealth from doing it and the build relies on a string of stealth's chained together. It could have been 15 seconds but I don't remember. It was quite a while back.
---
Instead of a discussion, you throw out a "you bad" statement and think that you suddenly win the argument when it accomplishes the opposite.
---
You can wish for a limited set of "elitist" players and all that will do is get you a neglected or cancelled game mode. If A/Net could make a change tomorrow that put 30% of players into WvW and brought it a bunch of new players but lost every single existing WvW player then they would do it in a heartbeat. 
---
The only investment in the game mode will always be for things that will benefit a wider audience. You and your buddies might think those changes are terrible but that doesn't make them bad changes. The changes are made to benefit all players, not a bunch of people who think that the sun shines out of their arses.
---
If A/Net put a rating gate on WvW then you can happily complain if someone starts playing and they aren't worthy, otherwise it's a place for all players.
---
Well as someone who haven't bothered to try and get through the queues, there was a short window yesterday when I came home without queues.  
---
You try following a commander on mount using the jump skill as often as possible while walking like a peasant behind.. Not easy to follow really.  
---
I'm not complaining, I think the mount can do some good for the game mode, but also bad if not implemented or balanced properly. I don't mind the unlocking of the mount, but until it's unlocked, you're just falling behind even further than before.
---
Everything you described about the hammer is also indicative of intentionally being for PvP -- blocks, evades, reflects, etc. are more useful in PvP than in PvE.Same goes for stuns. The damage is mediocre for PvE on most of these skills, but tuned just right for PvP.
---
The official forum mods decide which rules to enforce or let slide.  There's never been consistency with them.  And since they use anonymous mod accounts, we will never know if it's the same person, or a group of people who are randomly tasked to monitor the forums.
---
When Gaile was still in charge of the forums years back, I've had numerous infractions overturned because the mods made mistakes.  She even had to repost a deleted thread I made because *someone* was oversensitive with my criticisms about the state of PvP.
---
Don't let the forums get to you.  Anet turned it into a complete joke with their over policing with god complex moderators.

FT2 aftercast fix when q_q

Flamethrower 2.

There's also Awakened Zealot outfit (https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Awakened_Zealot_Outfit) which I'm afraid isn't on your list.
---
DPS directly relates to burst though, so this argument makes no sense 
---
Satire...  
---
that is why here.  
---
Even though forum mods overreact most of the time your plan was not thought through that well
---
That is a tech question., Put your ticket in for the tech team to research with everything you gave customer service., Customer service is just that basic crap...tech can trace it back IF needed and can do magic things if reappearing items like that...
---
Good luck 💜
---
I know it's not an outfit, [but this heavy armored top is also really revealing](https://i.gyazo.com/af6ad1e0b5fb9f9d465cca7654eb4763.png) ;)
---
Most of which were mostly bug or tool-tips fixes. Im talking about "game changing" patches that attempt to add/remove or shift power on builds, rather than throw a wrench at PvE builds ~~mostly basing it on a russian roulette style dart throwing done by a blind monkey~~ with pvp as an afterthought.
---
I love the idea of scouting and defending, but to do that, you gotta be a roamer. The WvW zerg is 80% attack, 20% defend (only the most important objectives), where as a scout/roamer will try and defend their needed supplies and towers (Please do not do as gandara though)
---
works but i get an error "1.70: error : couldn't find attach point: 56
---
Too early to tell but:
---
* I think Firebrand will see a lot more play in PvE, its condition build got a decent boost.
---
* For engineer, Holo is still the absolute best pick in PvE, the condition build needs the aftercast thing fixed for FT2 though. Scrapper is still garbage tier in PvE but I think the gyro rework will impact heavily on PvP which leads me to believe they'll overnerf the crap out of it again (the HoT experience). 
---
* Mesmer is still at a very solid place with Chrono and Mirage, at some point they should stop messing with it and bring other classes to that level of diversity.
---
This is cracking me up, I hope it's a troll.  Even ignoring the satirical nature, your post was *way* more toxic than the original one.  Dropping "PvE rallybots" in literally the first sentence?  Sincerely hilarious.
---
If you were serious, you should have just replaced WvW/mount with Raiding/LI and left the rest exactly the same instead of turning it into a truly bizarre ad-lib.
---
Thanks. I hope you guys don't remove the original length of the leap, because I think it's really awesome and necessary with getting across the WvW maps faster.
---
I'm hoping the nerf to the leap distance is only a temporary solution whilst places perhaps get higher walls/barriers? And then once those particular spots that have been exploited, have been fixed, could we get back the original leap distance?
---
Well it basically depends on the content. 
---
In fractal power is generally better because fights are short so you don't have to reach your full potential as Condi.
---
In raids it depends on the encounters. Generally speaking : 
---
- boss which have frequent invulnerable phases (KC, Sloth...) favor power for the same reason than fractals.
---
- boss which attacks a lot (Mathias, Cairn, Largos...) are quite vulnerables to confusion, making mirage a superior pick.
---
- boss who move a lot (Mathias, Cairn is considered always moving) are vulnerable to tourment so revenant is quite strong. If the boss has a big hitbox better (Deimos).
---
- boss with adds (Sabetha, MO, SH) are awesome to play as scourge because you can epi to cleave the adds and "epi back" in organized groups to stack condis on boss.
---
Overall, some bosses just favor condis. Mathias is the best example I think, because by playing Condi you have less chance to kill the targeted Ally when you CC and because the condis keep stacking up when Mathias is invulnerable. 
---
The top tier Condi builds are (imo) mirage, revenant, warrior, soulbeast, firebrand, scourge.
---
https://i.ibb.co/qpgWkMf/add-a-high-wall.png
---
Then once all these areas have been fixed, perhaps we could get the original leap distance back? :D
---
So I am not allowed to be angry over making a mount fucking worthless. What if a really cool skin comes out for this fucking mount and i cant get it cause its worthless.
---
I like the people pointing out "satire" as this all encompassing reason for the deletion when the actual warning the mod gave also applied to the original post that's still up and running, which I think was the point OP was making. The post is intentionally toxic, just like the original. 
---
My left ear feels funny now &gt;_&lt;
---
Hi Ben,
---
Please consider beta test weekends in the future.  The community will do the work for you for free, and they'll be much better at it.  Enlist the community to help with quality control and point out the issues/possible exploits etc. 
---
Python is the way to go these days not just for intro to coding but also its extensive use ... used in almost all the software engineering fields not to mention it is very easy to learn and you will quickly be able to produce useful code.
---
Best of luck and hope you have a blast!
---
Yeah - it would be nice if you could revert back to the original leap length and just put up some invisible boundaries to prevent people from leaping into towers, keeps etc. 
---
Probably.
---
Air is the hardest of all but generally DBL lords are way easier to solo than ABL in ny experience, and it's easier to avoid being spotted by people passing by.
---
Back to the drawing board! Gotta retest the numbers now. Expect an update within the next 24 hours.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/axp5x0/the_warclaw_speedtests_and_intel/
---
Yay more thief nerfs! Even when lords can be reliably soloed by most if not all professions!
---
I'm afraid those invisible boundaries might cause line of sight problems for people trying to cast spells on top, or people trying to hit from below.  Although I could be wrong. I was gonna say maybe have the warclaw drop like a rock when it is airborne.
---
Its so sad how much you have to invest when stuff like druid gets 10 ppl might for free by scratching its nose.
---
And even then you rely on blasting firefields which is a risky proposition in PvE to say the least. Also the way this build is shown you don't even give fury without rolling rng.
---
Checks out.
---
i'm not new but i would like to voice a few things about voice comms
---
1. getting verified can be really annoying and turning people off from doing it
---
2. team speak in 2k19
---
You use the mount to exploit a game mechanic to gain an advantage over others. The following is a list of things that would count as such things but is not limited ONLY to those things as the word "include" emphasizes in "These **include** buggy content:".
---
I don't really know what is so difficult to understand this. It is an exploit, don't post it on reddit!
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I mean it's not like this was developed and decided over the course of 2 weeks leading up to the firing.  The recent layoffs the week they were going to announce it isn't exactly an excuse.   If that was the first time they were going to test it out for possible exploits and issues......that's just very **poor planning** and **time management** on their part, and possibly justifies the layoffs of certain individuals. 
---
At this point you just trying to get me banned so you wont have to deal with my comments. No you made a mount killing mistake. Deal with it.
---
you can jump into hills and red ebg keep if you know how without a mount....been like that for years
---
sure, so all the pm's from the bugs in wvw got lost? 
---
I was unaware that people still used TS for wvw....then I transferred to EU and learned otherwise....
---
Luckily had a flexible pug group. After wiping for a while, I just went scourge with death magic for the insane condi survival kit (6k hit to DPS though). Swapped Chrono for an alac rev (but no quickness now). With all the running round, Chrono wells really suck. Swapped a DH for another necro and one shot it after those changes. Mobile alacrity is great!
---
No, it's faster than plain swiftness.
---
as i mentioned in the desc of the video lol
---
Sadly I've got kicked for suggesting this in pugs.
---
i hate them.... well.. the downticking is okay but i hate the gutted boon application
---
damn. sword/dagger + SB, rune of the forge, sun and stone spirit.. good old times
---
is this okay to do without getting banned? (paranoia)
---
how do you make them do this? I’m aware of the forced RP walk (i have it on keybind) but can all mounts trot? how?
---
i9-9900k OCd to 5.2 would be a good start
---
Kek
---
Don't think there is a CPU out there that will do what you want, sad to say. 
---
* ...
---
Thanks, but yes, as you mentiones below, all those things are too much convenience for a single player and unlikely to be added. 
---
In WvW/PvP atleast if you hide the Nature Spirit somewhere safe it makes for a rather reliable self rez.
---
I mean, no, seeing as the golem-creating, golem-utilizing, golem-themed, golem-riding race has no golem using class, no.
---
Gief golemancers please.
---
you need to go to jaihai bluffs and pick up exactly three pieces of airship wreckage by the airship base in the south corner. that will weight down the griffon and/or warclaw enough to trot. they are the only ones i believe have a unique animation for that speed unfortunately
---
rip
---
it finally seems to sink in with you that just because chrono lost some dps or support buffs, you can still play it in most, if not all content, successfully.
---
I noticed that if you use Harbinger Shroud and then manifest a Shade, the shade will not explode, only you. So you really need to manifest sand shade first and then use harbinger shroud for the damage to proc through the shade. Is this working as intended? Im not very experienced so I dont really know if its a bug or not.
---
Ahhhh okay. I wish there was a separate keybind option for it, since the animations exist for some :(
---
me too! maybe one day anet will add it
---
&gt; He just loves to hunt the cursor on the screen
---
So why isnt he but looking into the camera instead?
---
unless the cat only hunts the cursor when OP is playing GW2 but it seems the cat isnt interested in hunting the cursor at all.
---
Main sources of slowdown are:
---
\-shadows
---
\-character model limits &amp; quality
---
\-environment quality
---
\-reflections
---
Most impactfull CPU specs are:
---
\-Cache size &amp; speed
---
\-IPC
---
\-Memory speed
---
\-Frequency
---
Stutters are not fixable by ssd/cpu/gpu/ingame settings.
---
For new CPU specifically for gw2 - look for high end CPU with good single core performance and OC ability.
---
For stutters you can try d912pxy, it should help with stutters and maybe general performance (around 20% max).
---
Then go find another comm that doesn't care about voice but don't cry about queues, not finding comms willing to deal with you or comms for you wiping all day. 
---
And if you're not willing to follow their lead don't be surprised they'll treat you like shit.
---
Surely that means you wont be desperately stalking any group you can find to leech, right? 
---
Quite a few missing actually.
---
If "solid" means its only good for Raids as Condi Dps and no where else.
---
Which one?
---
You might find it a bit frustrating later on when the commander + 90% of the blob has a mount, you might be left behind as they dash on with their mounts.
---
This is just a rant

&gt;Bulwark gyro I haven't seen used (or used myself), so I can't give any ideas on it. (TBH, this skill scares me because people love to face tank damage in PvP, so it seems like suicide to me.)
---
what the fuck
---
&gt;Blast gyro is a blast (pun) to play with, but its wind up could be a little longer to allow some counter play 
---
&gt;Whirl gyro seems to be in a decent spot, idk if it would need any change, but I'm open to discussion.

what the actual fuck

The GW2 is obsessed with defending essentially anything ANET does.   On Reddit it usually just means any form of criticism gets downvoted hard.
---
There have been a few cases (mount skin gambling for example) where people have been in general agreement on something, but yeah the norm here is to anonymously downvote.

The sub is in "Defend Anet" mode.  It's a form of denial stemming from the layoffs.  A "If we don't say anything bad then they won't close the studio" fallacy.
---
Yes to most of that, but also expansions. There is a huge hype factor around expac releases that just cant be matched by anything you suggested. "Guild Wars 2 now more beginner friendly than ever" or "GW2 finally reworked their guilds" or even "GW2 just released build templates and nothing was ever as good as this in the history of video games" only attracts veterans at best. A new chapter in an MMO is much more like a soft reset button that gives new players a chance to catch up (admittedly not as much as in other MMOs). Pretty much all of what you suggest are good things but only matter to people already playing.
---
I never said it wouldn't, and I don't care one way or the other.
---
I'm saying that if your client isn't loading player mount skins, then the use of skins is objectively not what is causing your frame drops. This is not an opinion, this is just logic.
---
Sorry to tell you but there are very few classes that can actually be effective playing the Damage role in WvW zerging.
---
Usually that something involves having an abundance of ranged Damage that isn't projectile based.
---
Scrapper doesn't have that and you will be a deriment to your Team if you go into zergfights as zerker scrapper.
---
underrated octopus joke
---
You can't help it, can you. No matter how hard you try, you fall back on an attack of some sort.
---
There is only one person who wants their ego boosted here and it's not me.
---
Actually pretty much everyone transmuted their legendaries if they wanted to actually use them and not just stand around in LA and look pretty. No one wanted to be weaker because they were using an absolute top of the line piece of equipment. 
---
I thought they were reduced to their pre-HoT size, not closed entirely
---
Well being them back anyways. Should be easy implementation. 
---
You had the perfect opportunity to play stayin' alive by the bee gees and you missed it!
---
It makes sense to have the WvW laurel vendor, there are already other WvW NPC's and the only one missing is that one :( maybe they just didn't think about it. I hope they can change it soon because it's an useful NPC.
---
God damn that seems like a way, way better idea.

---
Run this. Your group can literally not die to condis if you chain your cleanses. You do no damage, but scrapper is trash for damage in wvw (low cleave radius).
---
Doesn't enabling slow walk do the same?
---
Bag inside a bag giving 1 blue and 1 trash item. Magnificent. 
---
Mirage and Chronomancer. Mesmer is always the right answer at the moment, sadly.

and commander be like "one more time and kick"

As per my tests, it was 900 and now is 600.
---
Followed by 9 months of [encumbered]
---
Does dank server drama memes on the sub mean WvW is alive again?
---
The good news is that the dismount-jump can be fixed much more easily, either by marking areas impassable or shifting ledges to prevent you from standing on them anymore. Both Fire Keep Inner and Valley Water Gate rely on you standing in pixel wide spots to climb.
---
Oh they are no where near closing the studio, people just like to get themselves all worked up.
---
Oh, the feels.  How dare you sir!

Hm then you should lean more towards a roaming build.

---
Try it out, but I don't see it working in zerg play. 
---
I guess PvE. They don't mean harm, they are just used to getting fixes if content is broken.
---
Should have gone with mesmer if you wanted to impress people
---
&gt; Knockdown from dismount should not be stunbreakable.
---
Maybe in enemy territory, since if you glide in enemy territory you get birds that attack you and knock you down.. maybe if you get dismounted something similar happens?
---
No cap as in not use supply, or no 3 person cap?  cuz both would break so many things..
---
especially anything to do with wvw. i don't enjoy it personally but it seems like a lot of pve players just hate wvw so much that they dont even want to see it on the game sub so they just downvote everything to do with it.
---
Well, if I did not want anyone to play an OP spec that I enjoy playing, I would just say it's bad to other people.
---
Is this damage control. Its fast as using staff guardian speed circle but no faster. And leap is pathetic.
---
from your wiki
---
-16% increase over out of combat movement speed with Swiftness.
---
-It is the slowest mount.
---
I dont think that it is 16% faster. I do agree it is the slowest mount tho with the pathetic leap nerf. 
---
&gt; If you only need a few more points to get tha last reward of a reward track and also want to leave WvW then, you won't bother with running to your zerg again. You just let the participation tic down
---
You can do that in Obsidian Sanctum though, no need to take up space on the main maps.
---
Unrelated, were you a gw2 youtuber?
---
Funny meme.
---
Said this, the mount wasn't what was expected by many. After an artificial hype, the lack of testing proved the Warclaw allowed certain actions that could be avoided before being released (I talk about the possibility to enter into structures -Hills, Garrison, etc- without using siege, a clear terrain exploit). With its damage being reduced (26% less), number of targets nerfed (10 to 3) and the dodge distance also reduced (for avoiding the exploit), its use in WvW is merely to move a bit faster in the maps... and not everywhere, but already less of 60% of total space: the mount isn't aquatic, so you get dismounted, plus certain spaces with lot of falls avoid to use it safety.
---
Added to this, the mount is less useful in PvE even: dodge movement is shorter than raptor, slower than jackal or even skimmer...
---
For ending, WvW didn't ask for this. I know this is becoming a mantra, but it's sadly true: the game mode has a lot of problems that should be priority... and about we still didn't hear but vague promises for being fixed.
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guide:WvW_Guide_For_a_Novice
---
Using one cc to get someone off their mount would be a bit strong, but you could give the mounts a breakbar, so coordinated play gets rewarded. Stealthing on a mount is too strong in my opinion. Think in PvE they made it so that you are stealthed but not your mount. Don't know if that's the same with mesmer veil too, but I'd assume so. That could make it so, that you are not seen by guards and sentries and shit, but if people are around they see the mount running around. Maybe a good middleground.
---
Noob build question: I notice that metabattle and snowcrow builds are slightly different for Support Chrono. On meta, they suggest full diviner armor with the rest beserker. Snowcrow only sports 3 diviner armor pieces + the backpack. The stats difference aren't small in these two builds. As gearing Mesmer is hard, I'd prefer not to waste my money on gear I don't need. Which should I go with and why?
---
As I don't have a medium mistrell set yet. Is giver ok, or should I mix some vitality into it?
---
Thank you all :) ! 
---
I believe other players are greatfull aswell for this :) 
---
I will mix a bit the gear and try the builds posted here hehe! And see what fits :)
---
&gt;  It would be nice if Anet did a bonus wvw week/weekend once a month to help on that front.
---
I was thinking how about at every relink?
---
nah, that's it's own animation which is just walking. irl [horse gaits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_gait) are classified in the same way as the griffon/warclaw; walking is a four-beat gait and trotting is a two-beat gait.
---
**Horse gait**
---
Horse gaits are the various ways in which a horse can move, either naturally or as a result of specialized training by humans.

Well, my griffon lion skin does the trot to
---
As a new casual WvW (being doing dailies + camps solely to towards getting the legendary backpack), I would like to share my experience since the last patch as I have put much more time in. The previous 2 days actually first made me want to quit the mode permanently and the following day made to see that it could be enjoyable.
---
Firstly, I don't use voice much at all and it should not be hammered in chat every 30secs. People who haven't joined yet are not going to. I understand it's a lot better to have everyone listen but personally I'm just ok with following the commander and just using common sense to contribute (taking + using supply, watching for enemies, maintain positioning in fights, using appropriate team abilities).
---
Secondly, the enjoyment is solely based on the commander. It's really difficult to go one way or another but I nearly quit WvW because I waited 2h to join a map whose commander almost exclusively looked for fights. Running past objectives, sometimes all the way to their spawn base and fighting them. We lost most fights so it was a real bore-fest and felt like a real chore running back every time. Asking in team chat about this kind of play-style and the response was just take it or leave it.
---
Lastly, last night I joined EotM while waiting in the queue. There was no commander available (only one was private) and everyone was kind of just doing their own thing. So I said screw it and tagged up (I use it for PvE metas). I had a freaking blast. I got lost a few times but i had 20 people in the group with a ton of others just following and we capped some objectives and fought when we wanted to. Just a nice balance between everything. We ended up getting stomped by an organized guild but everyone was still cool and we all had fun. It's probably the most casual way to play but I think it might have just appealed to me more because it didn't feel like I was joining some serious raid.
---
Anyways, this patch has brought a lot more life into the mode and has at least encouraged more people to see what it has to offer.
---
But the thing is they're not garbage. They can probably clear all content. They're just not meta.
---
With 3 specs a class, Not all of them will be meta and that seems to be what you want. It's not feasible.
---
While scrapper might be one of the weaker classes in PvE, Buffing it would cause it to be absurdly overpowered in PvP.
---
I don't mind if it changes the playstyle, as long as it's fun. But I really think they should reconsider the bonus speed in friendly territory, or every small roaming group can't easily be rekt by a huge blob on mounts.
---
people said the same thing about those who got banned for "cheating" after some high school rejects spyware got installed on their pc, look how that turned out lmao
---
I was more thinking say a squad trying to take a tower, and the enemy squad being able to get back quicker wouldn't be so bad.. as long as it kept the action going, but for a low man group trying to take a camp with a bunch of people being able to return quicker I can see as pretty cancerous.
---
The meta for chrono changed slightly three days ago so they may or may not have updated it. 
---
Also, "meta" builds are often designed for very experienced players working with a perfect team under perfect circumstances. I'd advise more diviner's gear to give you more boon duration as this allows you a greater margin of error. Soul pastries and lucent oil will add on a chunk good chunk and are worth investing in. Those two + the sigil of concentration add on about 25%BD, which is huge.
---
I'd still aim for as high a boon duration as you're comfortable with as, in reality you'll get interrupted, knocked back, downed, and have to drop a poison bomb in Sloth or Matt, get sacrificed etc. More boon duration means your squad will be able to keep going for a bit longer.
---
Living World Season 2 trinkets allow you to stat diviners, so if you have any rings on characters you're not going to use, you could infuse or attune them to restat them. 
---
It's easy to unlock, so it's not a great problem though.
---
Congratulations, you are the millionth person that posts this crap.
---
I do see at least QL and the leap into Garri inner fixed though (haven't tried).
---
I can't update my client because there seem to be a transpacific submarine cables were damaged yesterday. I'm currently in Asia and my connection is always timed out. Is there any alternative?
---
It happens with all mounts since day 1 of PoF.
---
Metabattle suggests that you take more boon duration to have a safer boon uptime while SC suggests that you take a more agressive gear to greed more DPS but if you mess up your rotation or people don't get some of your boons (from wells mostly) your uptime will suffer more.
---
Since a balance patch just hit this week I think neither Metabattle nor SC have updated their builds/gear yet to accomodate the latest Signet of Inspiration change so if I were you I would hold on for a itttle bit until the builds are updated.
---
Then again if you want a very safe boon duration and never want to change your chrono gear (unless there is a huge change in chrono), do not think the DPS loss will matter much and want to be very safe then you can go for the "Max Boon Duration Variant" that way you will always have enough boon duration as long as Chronomancer is used to provide boons (you will overcap in Fractals with pots).
---
Brings a whole new meaning to meatshield.
---
I'm not really sure any of us can actually tell you why some stuff are or are not in the game since we don't work at Anet and also this is not really the goal of this thread :p
---
I am actually surprised people still make themselves  play PvP.
---
&gt; Living World Season 2 trinkets allow you to stat diviners
---
Living World Season 3 you mean?
---
&gt; There was not blame for "the entire WvW community" 
---
Actually there was. If you read the thread, you'll note the OP generalizes the community. It literally says so in the thread title of the post. Here is what the OP typed, word for word: " However, the WvW community is extremely toxic "  
---
Feel free to explain to me how that isn't blame for the entire wvw community. I'm listening.   
---
You're free to be "disgusted" by whatever disgusts you, but as an actual WvW vet of 6 years, the only thing I find disgusting is the sense of entitlement from threads such as these that expect the most neglected community/gamemode to hold people such as OP's hands and serve information that is readily available on the internet on a silver platter. 
---
There's always trolls in chats, they're actually few and far between. If you ignore them, most of your problems tend to go away. This is what the ignore feature is for, and something people should start using if it truly bothers them.   
---
&gt; Again: are all of "us" like that? Luckily no, and I would argue just a minority.  
---
I don't know about you, but as soon as this patch hit, WvW chat became more "toxic" than I've seen it in years, with tons of abuse towards commanders and players who wouldn't bend over backwards for people who wanted their mounts. No, not everyone is like this. That would be a generalization, kinda like what the OP did regarding WvW players.   
---
Granted, the post that was referenced is on the mild side, but it doesn't take too long too see the plethora of entitled, angry, and virtiolic posts being spewed about on the forums in regards to WvW'ers not spoonfeeding information or commanders not inviting them to closed raids. 
---
Yes, sorry.
---
&gt; Out of curiosity after reviewing her video what concerns are there of her story not being legitimate? 
---
I have both sunrise and twilight but neither legendary.
---
This is because I soulbound both and crafted eternity which I then gave to my bf. No legendary for me but I have both skins.
---
That's possible with twilight, I see no issue with why they wont replace bifrost though.
---
You don't need to stand there AFK, counting people who are also AFK... I played WvW yesterday for 3h and during that, I teleported back to the spawn 5 times. And guess what? Some people didn't even move an inch the whole evening. And 3 of them had an local chat RP session going on.
---
Temporary spike due to the mount. I'm just hoping a bunch of people will stay in WvW for a while!
---
There's a command in the special area to summon svanir, you can also summon a wave and another thing that i don't remember.
---
Stupid question, but how close were you to the thing they were attacking?  Are you sure it wasn't splash damage?
---
did you manage to accomplish anything beyond staying out of the zerg's reach?
---
because the player base posts bug reports on reddit rather than using the bug report system.
---
Actually been raiding with the new scrapper since the balance patch and it's a ton of fun. If you have a half-way decent pug then you won't run into any issues completing stuff with it, and it won't slow you down dramatically either.
---
I need to own up for anets mistake? They introduce game breaking stuff, implement half assed solution and I'm wrong?  
---
  
---
And what do you mean WvWers? I've been playing the game mode for the first time in the past 2 weeks. Get out of your Ivory tower. Anet has pulled this stuff before and they are doing it again.
---
By Grabthar's Hammer!
---
All of the "dismount exploit´s" are actually still working on enemy  territory. Now after the patch the everything else must be tested again.
---
heal scrapper is in literally every guild roster rn, it's also a good bruiser spec in pvp, maybe even too good.
---
Hahahaha.
---
Fucking dumb. Was fighting a YB guard and Engi yesterday at Bay. After deleting them, they spent the rest of the time sitting on Arrow Carts spamming 1. 
---
As i posted on another post:  All of the "DISMOUNT exploit´s" are actually still working on enemy territory.
---
Now after the patch everything else must be tested again. 
---
This gives Engineer whole new meaning. 
---
Now you just need good build, a lot of barrier and heals on you and you can laugh at enemy that tries to destroy the gate.
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
wow that was boring
---
well it won't get a cent from my pocket unless they restart with the 6 pieces at 300 each.
---
Also you need quite a bunch of resources from meta event chain for 32slot bags that prioritize consumables. But ye, the amount of champion bags is crazy.
---
Yes, but those don't have "consumables priority"
---
Let's go one better. Allow scrapper to bring the effects of both banners and spirits. They don't stack, accessed in a completely different way.
---
We really should have progressed past the chrono, druid, warrior trifecta after three and a half years so I'm all for any changes that actually start to balance beyond the dps specs. 
---
It's a stupid suggestion that's not going to be implemented.
---
I've.. actually had.. Been a long term fashion wars player and that is why I gave up on Asuran females (yes I tried all weights). I do however have a charr female, because she looks good in leather.
---
Exotic is crafted only, so your exotic vendor is the trading post. 
---
You need to own up for making a FALSE CLAIM (That Anet do not fix obvious problems with the game).
---
It's absolutely pathetic that you are literally incapable of admitting you said something that turned out to be proven wrong immediately after you said it.
---
What Anet has "pulled" before is irrelevant, you said that the gari exploit wouldn't be fixed and you were wrong.
---
How long you've been a WvWer is irrelevant, I just said that your defeatist and negative attitude is one that most WvWers share. But it does actually make it even worse that you were suggesting Anet would never fix a WvW issue despite barely even having any experience with the game-mode.
---
South Park reference?
---
Thanks for the advice, maybe I made it sound like I wanted them to make them like the game, that's not the case. I was just questioning in what way and how much I should help in things like explaining a Profession, acquiring gear, helping with my own characters, and how much I should let them explore alone :)
---
Does Rune of the Chronomancer have any practical application on the new scrapper gyros (as they're considered wells) as a power build, or is scholar probably still better?
---
No 3 person cap, or increased cap to 10-15
---
Lets call it "Meat Wall" tactic.
---
Finding someone nearby who has the patched version, so you can copy/paste the .dat file.
---
Other than that, you'll need connection to the Anet servers. Not sure how one would force a connection to go across Eurasia and the Atlantic instead, but maybe someone in a more relevant subreddit can answer that one for you.
---
Let them find out for them self, it’s the best aspect of the game, if they ask you can show them, yet let them do it themselves.
---
One thing I found for my friends who don’t like the game but have fun with group activities like doing some PvP once or twice per week is always fun, at the same time I offer trying a game they choose ^^
---
Noice, thanks.
---
Thanks for all the great reply! 
---
Just start to use arcdps, isn't that risk since you can delete your items? Genuine question since I'm thinking about using. 
---
Wow that was unexpected. 
---
Because it’s not Istan farm or benefiting the play in any way.
---
The Quickness is probably quite useful for Scrapper, but it kinda depends what for content you're aiming for.
---
Engi in general is too much of a bruiser to make use of the Scholar's 6th bonus in WvW. In pve, other classes should provide the necessary Quickness instead, so I would only use Scholar for pve.
---
If you flip an arrow cart over it says "Made in Yaks Bend." 
---
A possibility maybe, yeah. Though I do think there would be a good portion of players who'd still like to go to cities, as it seems to facilitate a huge meeting place where players like to hang with everyone and their friends (that isn't only limited to a party of 5)
---
Plus, I guess, if these passes (Mistlock, Armistice) are anything to go by, these have shown to not have killed cities, thankfully. 
---
The waste of time is this whole thread. If we arent talking about raids what are we talking about? Open world solo roaming? Guess what? Scrapper is fucking overpowered at that, so there is no room for complaint.  So if we arent talking about open world or raids is this thread about fractals?  It's hard to tell what we are talking about because the original topic is asinine and pointless.
---
Also happy cake day!
---
You have plenty of ways to build your warrior and cover almost any kind of playstyle you want. What's the deal?
---
I would agree, level up with them ^^ nice advice ^^
---
Well, I'm not new I play WvW pretty often but,... Do you wanna know what was my experience after Warclaw path? A was ashamed. A lot. 
---
I took it as an opportunity to show my favorite game and especially this game mode to 2 my old friends from Warhammer Online RvR times and while they had a great time and decided to stay I was quite upset about all that newcomers / pvers hate in the map chats. That was not the community I'm so proud of.
---
Well if im honest i liked the whole mob raiding on the keeps/tower etc. but i found that i was useless at 1v1, i do admit i was playing a class that was way out of meta but it still made the combat very unfulfilling and i could only get one shot in before dying in a matter of seconds, which led to frustration and then eventually just closing the game to cool down(im not one to rage quit often) ^^; I know that the people who were able to get rid of me within 2 sec have probably played the mode way longer then me and had the right build and skill set but I guess i'll be sticking to pve unless there's a mob doing the maps. I found playing against my guild mates a bit weird x'D i had one spare me because we had the same guild tag and another brutally stick a banner in my chest, thats what i get for being deso while half my guild is gendara :P
---
Awful because my PC absolutely could not handle it. I've only had a PC capable of dealing with it for a little bit but here are my answers:
---
1. Fun to run around, big fights are fun to partake in sometimes.
---
2. Self-importance of some of the community who think they own the game mode because they've been there forever.
---
3. Invited me to a Squad and was very jovial throughout the ups and downs of a typical run. Understood it was a game and not real life.
---
4. Goes back to 2, stop acting like children and it would be an improvement.
---
5. Either/or. Sometimes I like to run around on my own and flip camps and shrines and whatnot, sometimes I like to be involved in a bigger way.
---
If you just try them out without abusing them to cap the stuff and inform Anet about it, unlikely they will get you in trouble (e.g. add in the video that you leave the place)
---
My server was ok but I heard some servers are awful to play on.
---
I play on SFR and it was like LoL match, often even caps was envolved:-D
---
Same for me. 
---
We know for sure that during  the next 2 week there will be queue and a lot of 'pvers'. 
---
At least 90% of them will go away after they unlock the mount. But we need to make a maximum of people wanting to stay, but with all this hate a lot of people who would have been interested will go away thinking this hate represent the majority of WvWer.
---
(sry for mistake, I'm not a native english speaker)
---
Interesting, thank you.
---
it wouldn't be such a huge issue if it wasn't timegated by 8 hours, but hey gotta inflate those numbers somehow
---
FYI: in wvw people can not revive you while in combat. generally it is better to WP asap after you die in battle, be it run run back to the zerg, or the fact that loot gets teleportet to you anyway.
---
glad to see your less than perfect experience did not discourage you from playing the mode again.
---
Gotta find a good guild to run with m8
---
no
---
I haven't tested it, but generally in GW2 unique effects applied to a unit don't stack - so my guess is only one Bulwark effect would be in effect at time per structure unit.
---
Yeah I ran into this on patch day. I run a medkit scrapper build and noticed I would instantly die when defending a gate. It took me a few hours realize that popping it and being near any fortifications causes almost instant death. 
---
And thing is that ppl who never cared about WvW was actually really enjoying it:-)
---
You forgot the plant crafting material.
---
I do this.  If they decide not to stay at least they’ll know not everyone in WvW is a turd.
---
I'm a rank 60 who works a lot IRL. Luckily I was home sick on Tuesday, so I started out and had a blast. But I had to log before I got the warclaw. Later that night I waited in the line for 2 hours, only to play for 20 minutes (still didn't get warclaw). 
---
I tried again Wednesday night, and was able to get in thanks only to the reset, but by then the Commander and most of the zerg had warclaws, and I couldn't keep up with anything going on. I was forced to flip camps and get minimal loot. If I could briefly sum it up, I would say after day 1 of warclaw my experience has sucked. When the commander was asked to slow down (not by me), he responded "get warclaw." I logged again, frustrated that nobody gave a damn despite the obvious long term advantages of getting as many people on warclaw as possible. I tried again on Thursday and logged before I even got in.
---
People are saying it is easy to get warclaw, but it won't be for new players and people who work a lot, because it will be very difficult to flip a keep. You need to join a zerg to do it, but they'll have flipped the keep by the time non-warclaw players get there. It has the real potential to alienate less than dedicated players, like it did to me.
---
The best solution I could think of is a sensible commander who knows what's going on. Perhaps he deploys foot soldiers as scouts or assigns a small group to flip camps and shares XP. Perhaps a second commander tags up for foot soldiers. Perhaps they learn to rely less on warclaw, at least until things die down a bit.
---
Game related, I could see mount renting or allowing a second person to ride a warclaw as potential fixes. 
---
TL;DR: Rank 60- the game is full of frustration until you get warclaw, which isn't easy because you can't keep up with the zerg and nobody gives a damn.
---
Some people have build made only for this king of gameplay. (It's called ganking)
---
Even if it's part of the game mode many people dislike this gameplay but you have to play with it.
---
If you can't fight against these people, try to always stay in small group when comming back to the tag. 
---
The mount will help to avoid gankers. 
---
Even with a high end CPU you're not going to get much better than mid 40s in these situations, and that may not even be 100% of the time. I don't know which particular Ryzen 5 you have, but chances are it's already good enough to get close to as good as you're going to get. A higher single core performance CPU like an Intel 8 or 9 series will do better, and better still if overclocked, but ultimately the gain is going to be minimal as you move further into that range. Put differently, your CPU is probably already at the point of diminishing returns for adding more CPU power.
---
For reference, I have an i5-9600k, which benchmarks at 25% higher on a single thread (which is most important to GW2) than the most powerful Ryzen 5, along with a GTX 1660 TI which is stronger than your 1060 and in WvW/World boss type situations I get similar FPS to what you report below: anywhere from mid 30s to mid 40s. I can get 160 FPS if I'm all alone in an area, and in smaller world boss events I can get into the 50s.
---
Still, for the particular game situations you're talking about my performance is better but probably not *that much* better in spite of in some ways significantly more powerful hardware (certainly the CPU is for what this game requires). You could probably push it higher if you went really high end, but even to spend the $700 or so to go up to where I am at now you're only getting a small performance gain.
---
I am a returning wvw back from the tourney days and got called a pve scrub. Ouch. 
---
it's the Inspiron 7560 :)
---
I was just "regular" down, but there were no more enemies, so I couldn't rally.  
---
In fact, after they ignored me, I managed to get up on my own, but died due to lack of enemies.
---
Scritches have been administered, but scratches were my reward
---
Well, I'm a casual, and I play on my own due to weird schedules (two children make organized play quite impossible.)
---
And crack celebration boosters and exp boosts - takes less time
---
It did lead to a lot of arguments with my other half when they'd say their East of me and ask I could reply with was "I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT IS!"
---
Lava font type thing.
---
I agree. 10 sec cripple would be terribly unfun.
---
That sounds like noob &amp; leveling players would be well advised to stay away from WvW PvP.  
---
At least until they have the necessary gear, consumables, and know their class. Or even better, all the classes…
---
I hope other forms of PvP in GW2 are more beginner-friendly?
---
They implemented the trot animation just for a single Jahai Bluffs repeatable heart?
---
yea this is a much better way to do it (also much higher uptime)
---
For the warclaw, you can get most of the achievment in edge of the mists.
---
You can't use the mount there so you won't be overrun by your zerg.
---
If you can't play a lot, you could log when you can to get the dailies.
---
You cet wvw XP potions with help to finish reward track. (that's how WvWer did it fast, they stacked potions before the patch hit to finit the track in 2 minutes).
---
Gw2 is a game, not an actual war. Concessions have to be made to that effect.
---
No comment on whether this is actually one of those places, I am not a wvw player so idk. I am just explaining why “it’s like war” is a bad argument.
---
Update your graphics driver maybe?
---
Generally speaking it's the only MMO that could and can pull off large scale PvP battles. I had a lot of fun with WvW near the end of HoT and much earlier on in 2013 and 2014 when solo roaming. Sure roaming is largely uneven ground and it's not balanced, but at least back then it was enjoyable. Didn't like it in HoT though, doubt PoF is any better.
---
What I dislike about WvW the most is the lack of reason to do good. While we were pushing Underworld from the bottom to Tier 1 and even made it a standalone server it was a very cool experience. However, without WvW Seasons, no rewards in particular for holding many objectives like some games have (extra nodes, access to extra content, crafting bonuses and such) and lack of this Server rivarly we had before HoT, you lose the drive. Over time, you start to ignore objectives because they are meaningless and just look for fights.
---
Already tried, have been occuring even updating gw, nvidia, windows, and intel.
---
Just bring a scrapper or tempest to cleanse...or a renegade for resistance. 
---
My question is why? If you didn't like it before the only thing that changed is a mount.
---
If that is all it takes to get you to enjoy WvW I'd bet a hundred gold you will not be playing it in a month.
---
Thank you!!!
---
any "skin" items are one time use only, *however* they also get permanently unlocked in your account's wardro e, from which you can always reapply them at the cost of one transmutation charge.
---
if you are talking about armors in the gemstore, they come in and out of rotation, so you won't always be able to purchase them.
---
Tyria is flat!
---
This is funny af.
---
Does this mean ranked PvP is more advisable then unranked for beginners?  
---
&gt; I hate invulns, infinite blocks, and evade spamming
---
&gt; Scourge has too many long range aoes.
---
Welcome to pvp/wvw &lt;3
---
I am not here to argue what is better. TS or Discord. My point is, both are viable and it depends on the guild/server. 
---
I barely do any Spvp so I'm not able to answer that.
---
I thing there is a similar system in unranked but I'm not sure.
---
As others have said, this is sadly not a problem that any amount of money can fix. It doesn’t feel like it should be that way, given the age of the game, but it’s true. 
---
We should set Tybalt up with an explanation that points people in the right direction but also warns them about diminishing returns and the impossibility of perfect performance. 
---
It is know the slowest moving person will be melted down and used to make siege from their gear. It’s weird because they always named Harrow K. Art. That guy gets around. 
---
Your question has already been answered, but...
---
Do you have the Account Jump Start package (2000 gems)?  I ask because I didn't know  about this when I was suffering from inventory shortage for such a long time.  You get two bag slots and two bank slots (which adds up to 2000 gems when bought individually), then on top of that you get 10 black lion keys, 30 unidentified dyes, and 15 transmutation charges.    I was very happy with this buy and all that inventory was a huge QoL upgrade, and the rest of it was nice icing on top of it all.
---
It's actually really easy and quickly done at the moment with so many players there. Definitely a lot easier than anywhere else, except if you get lucky.
---
Just post the post like normal and send him a link.. 
---
The main thing is this:
---
To ensure that the team does not hand out preserved bees, legendaries, things like that, we go by what our game logs show us. If something was lost the other day, that's normally not an issue. If it is months ago, it gets harder. If it is years and years ago, and maybe even connected to a system that isn't in the game anymore and may not even be tracked by logs any longer, then that slim chance becomes a highly unlikely and so on.
---
We're being stricter with this in part, by the way, due to a very loud protest here on reddit when users managed to scam the CS team out of Moto infusions. Those, too, the team could not trace in the logs, so we tried to do the right thing by trusting that players would be honest about their loss when they came to us. Sadly, it turned out they were not, and the threads on reddit called the GM team incompetent, lazy and other fun things.
---
As you can see, this is something that very much is on a fine scale, especially the moment it's being brought into the public eye on a reddit thread. As such, I will need to be very careful what I check and how I proceed. After all, everyone wants for us to be fair, and that's what we strive to do as well.
---
Nice work! 
---
WvW zerg gear should have a lot more toughness. I have been running medkit scrapper for a while in WvW and this patch definitely made it much more simple. I am running [Minstrel's](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Minstrel%27s) to increase healing and boon duration on converted condis. 
---
This is pre-patch from a couple weeks ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUSEUrT-6mc
---
Interesting. Thanks for the tip, dude. 
---
to start with that mentoring, let me tell you something about EotM: it's a farm map, it never was played as a wvw map. defenders are generally regarded as trolls there, hence taking a keep there won't become much harder with a new surge in its popuarity.
---
You're asking an inexperienced player to run, on foot, through the heart  of enemy territory with no support and a clear speed, offensive, and defensive disadvantage. They're easy to spot and show up on enemy maps. They'll be lucky to make it to the keep at all, let alone make it there before the keep is flipped.
---
Thing is, its very agile mount, (maybe even too agile), compared to raptor and jackal, warclaw can turn around much faster and there is no inertia of skimmer too. In some cases its really good feature.
---
The keep near your spawn should be easier. the other ones is indeed another story.
---
After reading your post, you are right, I do almost exclusively WvW since the pre-release of the game, so some thing that seems common knownedge to me are totally new to some people.
---
For instance, the number of time I've seen using catapults to destroy doors this week is damn to high. And my first reaction is saying they are stupid while instead they just don't know. 
---
So for a totaly new player, he has to get a few people, get some suplies. Get rams, put it at the door etc... which seem basic for me is not what they will do in the first place.
---
(Like if I go to fractals or raids I will do stupid things, I never go PVE so I don't know how it works)
---
I was thinking it's more like dominos since the damage is so high, each scrapper dying individually then respawning and trying to run back to die again. At least as a way to stall a capture until a flank reinforcement arrives. 
---
Commander does a fake push and half the zerg dies because they didn't know.. 
---
Sounds like Futurama to me.
---
They drops from fractal encryptions since.. HoT? Its safe to assume that the answer is, no, its a permanent addition.
---
If you mean - does this skin lasts forever after me using it, then yes, it is.
---
Have a chain of eles casting rebound on them.
---
This is exactly one of my major concerns about the mount. New players will be alienated and chased down by the opposing factions on their mounts. It wont be fun and it will turns people off meaning less new players stick around or returning players in the months to come. Again Anet didnt think this through very well as evident by the lack of QA and nerfs happening daily. But hey that's par for the course for them. 
---
you make it sound way more horrible than it is. ;) nobody knows that I am not a newbie when I did exactly that (before mount release) and it was fine. got I ganked  sometimes? ofc, but thats the game mode.
---
&gt; What did you like?
---
It's a mixture of a meta event and PvP. I enjoyed interacting with other players, feeling like I was improving and learning about a new game mode (to me).
---
I liked the small battles and skirmishes. It was satisfying when I survived them and came out on top. 
---
&gt; What did you dislike?
---
WvW players can take things *much* more seriously than in PvE and, I guess, PvP. Part of it is that you've got a massive mix of ability levels all in together, I think. 
---
Map chat is, if at all busy, more spiteful, rude and condescending than almost anything I've seen in PvE. Yeah, PUGs can be a bit crap but the baseline in WvW seems to blame first and insult later. "Just turn off map chat" seems to be the advice, but both /map and /team chat are essential if you're coordinating with others. 
---
Also, I much prefer smaller scale battles than zergs. Zerg battles feel overlong and underfun, but I completely understand why some people would like them. 
---
&gt; What did veteran player to make you like WvW?
---
Honestly, I have no idea. A few decent roamers took on noobie noobs and helped out. It was mostly fun but no one really said "I, a veteran, suggest we do blah" so it's hard to tell. 
---
&gt; What did veteran player to make you dislike WvW? (And how can they try to improve themselves acording to you)
---
"Why aren't you defending the keep?" - because you didn't put anything on /map other than a point of interest. Lack of clear communication is a bit irritating. 
---
&gt; Did you try to get involved in it or juste followed the flow of people?
---
I got stuff done and commanded small squads flipping camps and the odd tower or keep a couple of times if a commander left. I tend to play off-peak so it felt fairly low-stakes. 
---
There is no justice my friend, no justice at all.
---
still worth doing both metas once a day.
---
personally I like to do different metas a day and not camp the same map all day.
---
You just need a zerg of 15 engineers :) Each one activates gyro, drinks elixir S, waits until invulnerability wears off, on-death invulnerability kick in, halfway through you run away from the door, next engineer takes over.
---
Voila, invulnerable engineering fortifications :D
---
I know that. My question is why? It's literally a core part of the game mode and the actual end-game content that will actually push players to be better at the game.
---
It's this weird thing where players have to literally be forced to play the game mode and then they act all like "oh man this is so much fun why didn't I do it before?" and I'm sitting here like "why didn't you do it before, cuz it's been here the entire time and nothing really has changed."
---
Jeff: "Am I a joke to you??"

Unranked also has hidden rating I think so playing that if you're completely new is a better idea.

You can get an item as skin. These can be account bound wich you need to use or thow away if you already have them unlocked. Or soulbound on use, those you cam sell on Tp or seld to your friends so they could unlock it. After someone unlocks it then you will never see this item in your inventory. After unlocking you are able to use this skin anytime you wish for 1 Transmutation change on any item of the same kind as you wish. So if you would want to change skin for your pistol, you will be able to see only pistol skins. The whole list of your skins and skins you can unlock are vissible in your bank, in wardrobe section. There you can check diferent sections for diferent armor types and so on. Also you can serch for specific skin. Sometimes its hard to remmeber the one skin you just used , for that you can turn on feature in your chat so it would write the name of your skin in the chat after you use it. Aetherblade skins can be bought from Tp as most of them. They also can drop from Fractals of the Mist enscription chests but after 6 years I never had one skin droped so lucky you if you got one. Also when we are talking about skins I would like to mention that most of them are just use items but Blue Fractal skins are also "crafting" materials and can be used in Mystic Forge to be upgraded into golden ones. Just keep that in mind because its really usefull when you dont have the collection done . The reward is ascended chest of weapon. 
---
We pretty much slow danced our way into a keep in EoTM. Easy peasy. 
---
But will that be balanced out by the new and returning players we lose in months to come as they are left behind by their side and mount zerged by opponents? 
---
you can say this all you want, but it's still harder, and damn near impossible for people who don't know the first thing about taking keeps. Think of it like a tutorial map. For experienced players, going back and running the tutorial is easy. But for people who are just starting, the tutorial is hard and there are no instructions. Before the population surge, most people who dabbled in WvW only spent time in EBG because that's where the action is, so we may not know the first thing about EotM. The map itself may be intimidating. We may not even know things like which siege to deploy where, or which walls can take damage, or even which one is a keep.
---
Right now you're an experienced player telling new players that the tutorial is easy. But to them it's not hardly anybody cares.
---
I mean it's the bare minimum raiders, fractals, and dungeoneers were asking since the beginning of the game and their game modes.
---
But it's only WvW where this is apparently too difficult to handle?
---
But does it save the wall/gate?
---
Im glad that it's nerfed. At least now the economy will finaly be normal again for the rest of the people who were not farming. Now we can sell our little we got from other sources for a bit more when you are not able to farm it constatnly and get the price so low. Yay ! 
---
14k hp?
---
Yeah, I'm having trouble picturing this person handling a regular weeks T3 keep capture well.
---
Nah. It's just the slowed down run animation of a shared base rig.
---
Yeah, I finished mine last night.  lucked out and had a Commander that ran on foot.  Hoping to get a few more levels out of wvw this weekend though.  I've never wiped such large groups before.  Also got my first precursor drop.  Was a good day yesterday.
---
all they can see is your rank related title, and i assure you people barely pay attention to that. amongst the few people that do, there are just as many people prefering easy low-rank targets, as well as prestigous high-rank targets. all the fresh blood currently filling the maps doesn't even have an idea of what that stuff means.
---
there is also the option to use a transformation, quaggan tonics for example. many people, especially veterans which aren't quite as bloodthirsty, are likely to leave you alone then.
---
Rule 34 will never fail the internet. 
---
reduce HP to *zero*.
---
any successful hit should immediately un-mount opponents.
---
Yea all the exploits from my videos and the ones that i saw on reddit seems to be fixed.
---
Yeah, same as any other pass.
---
Join WvW!
---
Yeah, it's hard to focus on multiple battle at once
---
Yes, it does create an even bigger entrance gate for a new player into wvw. Those of us who play more got our mounts in 20-30 minutes.
---
Oh wait, now that I think of it. When people were singing along to the music bot they always where about half a second off.
---
Because it's still true!
---
*disapproving stare*
---
That has an even lower GPU than mine, yet the results is....way better!
---
Can i know your settings?
---
Never stop making these
---
Did you bought all these or made golds in game bro ?
---
&gt; Showing "content"
---
Yes. There is more in the game than istan farming and standing in Divinty's Reach.
---
&gt;there was some salt, rage, and whining from various group members about how 'cancerous' the new influx was and such. Remember your roots. Remember when you started, and how overwhelming everything felt. We aren't born WvW gods. Don't complain about how stale WvW is, then cry about all the know-nothings coming in, in the same breath.
---
I imagine this was more about the fact they had to wait 2-3 hours to get on map than anything else. None of the new players are cancerous. They are just walking bags.
---
And I mean, that's nice and all. Being peachy and sweet like that is cool, but having to wait in queue for 2 hours is fucking annoying and when you get in there is 15 people sitting in spawn preening on their mounts gives a sour taste in the mouth.
---
Also, being lectured by newbies all the time to be nice to them is only slightly less annoying and rage-inducing than being told to "calm down" when one is already calm.
---
New sexy clothes store deal: specials for choya and asura!

I don't know if it worked the same way back when, but making Eternity gives you both Twilight and Sunrise skins automatically, since mystic forging any weapon skin you don't have gives it to you.

Ear tits? Wtf is wrong with you?
---
Elixir S + Bulwark to slow down enemy
---
new meta
---
The latest patch reduced the amount of champion mob spawns to 5 during the hall event. It used to spawn like 15 or 20 once amala reached a certain health percentage. Beforehand, they also limited chests to some daily limit.
---
Looking over your specs, it looks like you will see improvements no matter which part you upgrade. If you are budgeted at max around $300 you can really only do one aspect for now. If I were in your situation, I would probably upgrade my CPU first as those can last longer than a GPU before they start showing their age. However, by upgrading your CPU you will also need a new motherboard and RAM. That will put you closer to $400 unfortunately. I would probably go for a combination of an i5-8400 (9600k if you want to see more improvements) +16gb of  3000/3200 mHz RAM on either a B360 or Z board in that situation. You can also upgrade your GPU and maybe add an SSD for your OS and for gw2 now and see pretty decent improvements as well.
---
I put together a [pcpartpicker list](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/sJcs4q) of some various parts that I would recommend. This list will change wildly based on your budget and goals, but can at least get you started with. Obviously, you cannot get them all with your current budget, but it could be something to think about. 
---
Please note that monitors are a little harder to recommend. There are a lot of options. I personally love ultrawide monitors. They work amazing with Guild Wars2 and I can see sooooo much more content at the same time. normal 16:9 monitors feel claustrophobic by comparison.
---
I think OP means Aetherblade armor, from gemstore, not the Aetherized weapon skins from BLC/Fractals.
---
1 word: MOBILE
---
So yes.
---
She drank her own milk and you're more concerned about which part of her it came from???
---
Spy Alert! 
---
They nerfed it twice! Because limiting the chests to a run per day wasn't enough, they had to reduce the 24 champs to 5! I guess it makes sense, it was the only efficient way to farm gold and people just burnt their time farming it non-stop. Hopefully it will make this community a bit happier now.
---
It's okay. We'll just farm Sandswept Isles instead.
---
\*Actually profitable believe it or not
---
There is a sub for this.
---
Some things never change, lol.
---
wait, really? what kinda GPH?
---
Theyneed to add crippling traps and make the mount susceptible to cripple (but not immobilized).
---
Where the cripple reduces the speed mount speed significantly, so crippling hits will be enough for non-mounted players to catch up, maybe allow dismounting to clear movement impairing conditions. (This would 'even' the engages for both attackers and defenders)
---
Scrappers are designed at their core to be bunker, I get that they’re hard to kill, but their kill potential is also very low. I think people are starting to get mad at them because now the changes actually made them viable when before they were RARELY ever seen. 
---
Holo pre-patch had much more sustain, boon uptime, and damage. Now scrapper has more sustain arguably, but WAYYYY less damage. I played scrapper a lot over the past few months and it was in desperate need for some sort of change. They’re supposed to be a hard class to kill, and now finally have their place as bruisers back. 
---
I think people just got too used to fighting Holos with no barrier that the drastic change to a barrier-centric spec is a learning curve to try and beat. Give it some more time to truly decide if scrapper is OP, it’s still early with this new gyro change and I think in the next week or so people will start learning ways to beat them. 
---
So to sum it up, yes scrapper is hard to kill, but it was designed to be a bruiser/tank from the very beginning. If you look at its damage compared to a holo running the same stats there’s still a huge difference. Scrapper has difficulty upkeeping stability, with the current meta gyro bunker build they have 1 source of stab and 1 stun break, both with fairly high cooldowns. if you can route those out and bait the bulwark gyro they really don’t have much to work with until their cooldowns come back.
---
I agree :) I meant it that way but wasn't clear enough about it.
---
So now even scrapper joined the club, rangers do that from years already and more reliably with "Guard".
---

Then I've been lucky, I've never been let down if there was someone nearby.
---
Darn!  
---
TIL
---
Thanks, make sense.
---
i wasnt a real fan of them before patch (so take my opinion with a grain of salt); but i would splash nature spirit in a lot of builds because that res is really nice... then they nerfed it to a tiny radius i can barely justify it anymore
---
higher potential upkeep oh frost spirit is nice i guess; but i dont care that much
---
im fucked off about storm spirit though; it does a lot of damage? no because it doesnt scale off player stats and seemingly cant crit (with fury and spotter i couldnt get it to)... alright whatever; 3s daze is still really nice with moment of clarity... oh right; nerfed to 1s base (is 3s on a clearly telegraphed and delayed attack that much to ask for?)
---
I don't listen to hip-hop.
---
As a roamer I am done with WvW. Looks like spvp only now.
---
Ok now this IS going too far
---
Thank you for explaining this! Again, I’m super appreciative of your transparency about this.  
---
So is one basically useless now in WvW without PoF? I haven't seen anyone mention this yet. Would kinda suck for a new player to be forced to buy an expansion right away if they want to play the gamemode.
---
its important to sample your own brand frequently, for quality assurance
---
Nah its never once deleted anyone's items. It's not interfacing deep enough to mess up that spectacularly. It literally just sends simple commands like "equip berserker's sword of force" and "select trait bolt to the heart". It's not sending complex code or binary or anything that could glitch out, it sends the exact same commands as your hero panel does when you equip stuff. 
---
I just noticed the bot did not paste the patch notes
---
No this is Patric
---
Highest single target DPS power class if and only if the target doesn't attack back. In wvw and pve, our low hp doesn't allow us to just let us stand there and do damage so easily.
---
In wvw, we are out classed by anyone in 1vs1 setting because people can do more damage and better sustained.
---
In pve, we get outnumbered. We can take one target easily. Multi or High hp boss will out kill us very easily.
---
Thus, our way of countering this? We run or hide and pray you dont heal.
---
did you expect any other kind of reaction? XD
---
It’s important to clarify that tag a guard means you must kill at least one guard before your team flip the objective and just doing damage to walls or gate doesn’t give one credit when the objective is flipped.
---
Wait, someone who actually responds in depth to my responses?! Amazing! Lemme give you more useless crap to read, since I'm just That Guy.
---
As far as the "click to copy" thing, I more meant that there should be some sort of visual indicator that clicking this card does something, *before* the card's clicked. [https://gw2.ninja/chatcodes](https://gw2.ninja/chatcodes), for example, which I often use to post stuff like \[Banana of Mischief\] in chat has a simple "copy" button. I think we can ignore my other suggestion for now, as on reflection, I think you're right.
---
For the PvP/WvW cards (yeh, for fractals, it's kinda a case of "if you don't know what these mean, don't do them"), mind you I'm coming at this from the perspective of a *complete* PvP noob. I think I've ever only done a single match ever while playing since the betas, so maybe this is another case of "if you don't know what the daily is, don't do it"? I'm just not sure if there's a info-imbalance between PvE and the other cards, at least visually? Not sure if there's any useful remedy to that.
---
For the where-to-collect stuff, yeh, that'd have to be hard-coded, and could get messy. Maybe if the card's a "collecting" daily (i.e., `card.title.includes('Forager') || card.title.includes('Gatherer') || card.title.includes('Miner')`), then have a row of tabs specific to that collecting type. So for example, today's is Kryta Lumberer. You could change the entry for Kryta Lumberer to read something like:
---
    "1972": {
---
        "title": "Kryta Lumberer",
---
        "art": "kryta",
---
        "waypoint": 244,
---
        "hints": [
---
            "Pick a gathering level and stuff. Healy sucks at descriptions."
---
        ],
---
        "gLvls": [{
---
                "name": "green",
---
                "loc": "[&amp;BIUAAAA=]"
---
            }, {
---
                "name": "soft",
---
                "loc": "[&amp;BC0HAAA=]"
---
                "name": "seasoned",
---
                "loc": "[&amp;BKgAAAA=]"
---
                "name": "hard",
---
                "loc": "[&amp;BKUBAAA=]"
---
            }]
---
            // and so on. 
---
    }
---
Again, this is gonna be a lot of work for you/your helpers, so only if you really want to.
---
I ran with a super nice group today. A bunch of people who seemed to know what they were doing and just needed a tag to help with coordination got me to tag up for them and guided me through taking a keep etc.
---
I didn't see a lot of complaints in any chat, so I'm sorry you had a bad experience with it :(
---
Thanks for the hint. I have 400 gems and gold for 200 more and i dont want to spend actual money. so i think 2000 gems is way to optimistic for me xD thanks anyways
---
Yeah I was going to say. If you can get enough people up that way to take it, you’ve earned it. The chances that a single person can make that trek first try are slim already. This is just a skip past outer isn’t it?
---
&gt; Note: I play PVE and WvW almost exclusively. PvP battles are not my thing.
---
lol wut? i get what you mean but still it made me "wut?" outloud lol.
---
&gt;...I clearly enjoy the Thief profession, but find it to produce the least damage, utility, and sustain.
---
thief in pve is just as capable as other class in terms of big dps. The utility you can bring as thief varies depending on what you are doing. Venom share can be fun and really usefull if your pug team lacks cc. Stealth is great for speeding things up by skipping mobs and being able to avoid triggering some traps etc. As for the sustain, (this is more for open world pve and maybe dungeons) i believe its in crit trait line, you can heal for a % of your outgoing crit dmg and its ez to get high crit chance on your own. 
---
Utility imo means what ever the team can use to increase success and make things easier, so if thats dropping a blind field on trash mobs so they never get any hits in thats great, or dropping the smoke screen so ranged attacks get destroyed before they hit anyone thats great to.
---
I think you're playing it wrong if you think that every class outscales you and you have no aoe options. 
---
sure, sure, I just wanted to bring up the point that, given the opportunity, thief dps should be much higher than OP is probably seeing. 
---
yeah the 14k doesn't exist, 12k is from any rune with the 10% extra health as 6th bonus
---
Actually I think one of the biggest changes you can make is to render subsampled. 
---
Plus PLZ remove the 5 downstate aoe in the arena fights. It should be WvW skills exclusive. This one isn't WvW...
---
Why are you spending all your time doing mindless farming instead of actually playing the game?  Or is pressing more than 1 button and not following a tag around too complicated for you?
---
I would like Anet lore devs to confirm this plz.
---
Boom.
---
But we, as thieves, have to pick out battles. There are people that won't see that. Because it's situational. We have our pros and cons just like everybody else. We are good for one hitting and running away; thats what Anet build us for. People will cry nerf especially for backstab and our auto attack for doing so much damage. We hit like a wet noodle with dagger main hand now. Instead they should be nerfing DE's malicious backstab and the perma stealth cancer. That is in the contexts of pvp and wvw but has an effect of the pve now since our damage was reduce across the board. We are single target... now with small number damage. Regular damage for backstab? Maybe 4k. Put it all on Berks stats and CS and DA... 10k but now no utilities or sustain.
---
Bring back Queensdale Champ train, don't @ me
---
Pretty sure it was account bound after transmuting. This was the only way to move legendarys between characters but the downside was you lost the legendary and only kept the skin.
---
Same for vigil gear, I had a friend who had it but we couldn't trade it. It was account bound so I had to make a new character and get up to that part of the story myself.
---
LOL All these salty posts about having their 30g/hour mindless farm nerfed.  Pressing 1 key and following a tag around while brain AFK getting 30g/hour is a bit ridiculous and this 100% needed to be nerfed.
---
One did a while back, just have to find the comment (though it may show up as [deleted], due to the layoffs)
---
Annoying but you have the skins at least. Ascended weapons aren't too bad to make so if they don't fix it, Don't worry too much about it.
---
Hopefully it doesnt come with chunky bits of earwax.
---
It's a kitty that wears armor.
---
Yeah, it's necessary.
---
So it's part of the culture? Lol. Didn't know that. It didn't used to be like that. Good to know!

Dont disrupt the turret mating frenzy.

"Are the sound effects really necessary, Kyaba?!" - SAO Abridged, ep 7
---
I think its a very nice addition to wvw especialy for roamers.Getting from point A to point B faster is nice,at least in my opinion. I also like the chain mechanic for busting trough doors.
---
...that actually made me physically cringe in discomfort. I'd applaud you, but I'm too disgusted by your wordplay to do so and need to take a shower first to scrub that filth off my skin that stained me by reading your unholy puns.
---
Ah, thats what going on. No but really, are they botting and for what? I see no point in afk killing a few mobs every minute unless im missing something. Haven't played in a while :D
---
Just make it so that the warclaw doesn't have any endurance in enemy territory.  Then you don't have to find every single jump exploit, because the warclaw can't jump anymore where it can be exploited.

3 reasons why people farm. Reason #1: Mats for legendaries or to make money. Reason #2: For money. Reason #3: Its a mmo and farming is apart of the genre.
---
hard lawl/cringe on this guy haha
---
Do we really need these paint comics every day?
---
b e c o m e   a s   g o d s
---
i never really did istan farm, i still enjoy doing ds, ab and sw rotations. they need map currencies to open chests while istan was too "free". i dont see a conspiracy here.
---
It naturally adjusts. Material prices drop and everyone gets easy access, then the farm slowly dwindles to a sustainable level.
---
It lowers other aspects of the game, but honestly GW2 has been utterly shit at actually giving material rewards for things you do naturally.
---
Basically, it creates a new balance, and new content should adjust to that balance.
---
There's so much QQ over a braindead farm like Istan.  It needed to die, move on.
---
Istan farm was mat based not gold based. The gold you did on those maps came from selling your mats. This effectively means no gold was coming into the economy from that map. What it did was making mats more expensive because there is a lesser supply of those, meaning that gold has become more valuable. 
---
Wow your tinfoil hat seems to be a bit too tight, you might want to loosen it a bit.
---
TH Keep metas are quite rewarding, more to come in the future.
---
If the level of gold earned between Istan and the rest of the game is as significant as your post suggests, then the nerf was definitely warranted.
---
Going forward, as people have less gold, the market price for goods will drop accordingly. This will make all other areas of the game more profitable than they were before.
---
Your card... shakes your tower?
---
I vibrates everything 
---
Legendarys can change stats (And now sigils?)
---
Ascended cannot.
---
Stats-wise, Yes. It's exactly the same. Which is why I did it.
---
Yeah, people just get baited by the latest nerf/change and fail to see the bigger picture.   
---
But yes, of course the nerfs to economy are all deliberate, every last one of them - and remember how anet used to be doing ninja nerfs throughout the first years of GW2 too? They are interested in forcing people to use cash. Other news at 11. 
---
I'm a FGS Train enthusiast but would gladly welcome the return of Queensdale. Map chat was always so comical.
---
While on paper this is true, the in-game realities mean that by the time it will take the market to adjust to gold deflation several sweeping changes and/or content patches will go live, making unpredictable impact on a variety of game systems. Realistic economy adjustment may or may not happen. 
---
I think the intention is that no single or few events will reward substantially more gold than other content, so that you can earn gold by doing whatever you want to do.
---
As you state it, there are a lack of farms. If there are a lack of farms, the value of gold goes up. If the value of gold goes up, then the smaller rewards you see in other areas of the game (that are too low to be considered farms) will go up.
---
whats dis? *nuzzles* UWU
---
&gt; People are saying it is easy to get warclaw, but it won't be for new players and people who work a lot, because it will be very difficult to flip a keep. You need to join a zerg to do it, but they'll have flipped the keep by the time non-warclaw players get there. It has the real potential to alienate less than dedicated players, like it did to me.
---
I understand your frustrations.  Just a small tip though...all you have to do to get credit for flipping a keep is attack a guard.  So even if you are super late to the party and your tag is in the lord's room already, just  hit some of the guards near the outer wall and you should get your Warclaw progress.

I hope it's good because [Fury-Scorched_Stones](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fury-Scorched_Stone) are account bound and are used in crafting [32-slot bags](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Reinforced_Olmakhan_Bandolier).

God damn, I'm glad I don't take a video game this seriously. I've spent exactly $0 on the game apart from buying the expansions and living world seasons and I'm having a blast.
---
I'm honestly glad that farms get nerfed so the economy will hopefully be less fucked up for us non-farmers
---
imma tell you chief alright, the reason is money, as much as I love raiding it really doesn't give a lot of money and istan was a place for consistent decent amount of money
---
These question are redundant. MMOs have endless content. If you finish one collection/achievement/skinset, you start grinding for another. If the game runs out of things to grind for, what becomes of it? What's left? AFK in LA? 
---
Mostly yeah, but actual proper legendaries have some minor advantages. You can swap their stats for free, and you can replace their sigils for free. (And, if theoretically another tier above ascended got ever added to the game, legendaries would be updated to be as strong as the new tier.)
---
&gt; specially if you haven't gotten that ascended back piece yet.
---
You mean the 'Let's farm shards every day for a month in order to buy the ashes of our own dead corpse, won't that be fun?' banner?
---
Not at all.
---
It was too damn late. People got used to the farm, and now they have to deal with the feeling of loss of something that shouln't have been there in the first place.  
---
And it was not enough. Because what we need isn't just adjusting the rewards in content that is being over-farmed and driving the value of gold down, we also need to improve the rewards in nearly abandoned content. 
---
With so much open world content, daily rewards won't cut it to keep everything populated. People will always choose what gives the most rewards, and there's only so many places people can go every day. 
---
It's time to go monthly.  Keep the current moderate daily rewards, but add additional monthly bonus to every meta. The rewards need to include real juicy stuff, like mystic coins and pact mapping materials. 
---
Aslo, they should bring back the monthly achievements in the form of quarterly achievements, and add even greater rewards for completing large sets of content over the quarter.  
---
Do every fractal level, every explorable dungeon, every world boss, fight in every pvp arena, conquer and defend a lot of different WvW objectives, etc. Then get rewarded for doing all sorts of things and being in all sorts of places. 
---
Then communitities would increase their frequency of runs and lone and solo players would be able to find the content populated more often.
---
I've tested this yesterday with some friends on the other side, and coulnd't see them in mounts while bugged, so is not a "fact" on ALL the cases.
---
Again, not necessarily true when you can just buy the rewards with real-world cash and other currencies. 
---
Didn't move... you can't make a difference between afk ppl and ppl who just ported back. Both stay in wp.
---
However, you still can't monitor ppl, without staying at them and stop fighting. At least for a certain periode of time.
---
and the desecration of decency's corps continues
---
I am having trouble wrapping my head around making ascended armor. For example I need to make Zehtuka's Guise (Harrier chest). I know that I can make a Guise with different stats and swap, but I am having trouble figuring out how to make it. I think I am just not understanding the basic concept of finding ascended recipes for insignias and armor. Can someone walk me through step by step please? 
---
I have the following:
---
\- Zehtuka's Harrier Insignia
---
\- Elonian Coat Panel
---
\- Elonian Coat Padding
---
\- Recipe: Maklain's Guise
---
Farming is part of an MMO. Do you expect to earn gold by just sitting still in LA talking in map chat?
---
I will do that in the future. I didn't do until now, because I just didn't know. And I think there are more ppl don't knowing this.
---
Forgive me if I am wrong, but I believe the value of gold to gems is based off market demand as well.
---
So, if the market decides the only way to get gold is via real world money, then they'll buy gems in droves and then the gem to real gold conversion will drop.
---
Lets pour one out for Bob aka Smoldge who got me most of my elegys. 
---
Huh... We must be playing at different times, then, because I've rarely seen Silverwastes successfully complete. It's always people mucking about with forts, then if we're lucky, it moves to mucking about with lanes, then it fails and everyone mucks about with forts again.
---
And sometimes tunnels open up in the ground and you can run in and kill stuff, but then it poisons you when you're done killing the stuff. Yay?
---
What?  Running from your garrison to bay takes like 15 seconds on foot, and most of the time there aren't even gankers.
---
What did you like?
---
I really enjoyed following with the zerg to complete whatever objectives the commander led us to. I liked the strategy of it all.  I liked meeting up with the enemy zerg for a giant battle. Sometimes I thought we weren't going to win, only to rally and destroy them all.
---
What did you dislike?
---
The only thing I disliked was that WvW isn't really intuitive. Earlier attempts at WvW I would enter and not have a clue what to do.  The entrance was typically empty except for 1 or 2 people messing around with the various vendors. I had read somewhere that there is usually a zerg force running around but I never could find them. Recently there has been a bunch more people hanging around the entrance and I have always managed to go out with a zerg the past 6 days or so.
---
What did veteran player to make you like WvW?
---
I guess I was lucky enough to find a great commander who was mindful that not everyone had a mount and that not everyone was a WvW veteran. He(or she) led the zerg without being mounted. If people fell/jumped to their deaths they would stop and make sure everyone was rezzed before moving on. He stopped for a few seconds at each are that had gathering nodes. He made the WvW experience for a new person like myself very fun and enjoyable. I think if you're someone who prefers being with the zerg, having a good and mindful commander makes a huge difference to ones enjoyment.
---
What did veteran player to make you dislike WvW? (And how can they try to improve themselves according to you)
---
I haven't personally experienced any mean WvW players yet, but statistics say that I'm overdue for an encounter of that sort.
---
Did you try to get involved in it or just followed the flow of people?
---
At first I just followed and attacked stuff when everyone else did. As time went on the objectives started making more sense. I finally figured out where to get supplies and then started to help build things when needed. 
---
After playing for less than a week, I'm rank 16 and 3/4 way through the warclaw track. The tail piece still eludes me. I'm actually having a lot of fun and can't wait to get back at it tonight.
---
Wait, wasn't the biggest instance you could get like 12 people? Or was the crash caused when some peopel tried to make a circular dependency of Life Bonds?
---
Your comment is basically saying "inflation is good because uh, it's good" the reasons you provide are unquantifiable and made up. 
---
Inflation is really bad for returning players, as their accumulated wealth is now worth far less, and it's also a bit of a mess for old content as it becomes completely pointless compared to newer content made with the inflation in mind. Lots of gw2 content has become no longer worth doing compared to pre PoF, for instance world boss trains and material farming are both much less rewarding nowadays. This is also kind of bad for new players as it means their accumulated wealth from leveling is insignificant since it's from completely outdated content.
---
Guild wars 2 did a really really good job of keeping inflation under control until PoF, but since then everything has heavily depreciated in value. It is a game which prides itself on being good to pick up and put down whenever, so vertical progression via inflation (as older rewards are no longer valuable, and older content is no longer worth doing) is counter to that philosophy.
---
blaming player mentality is stupid. player mentality is created by a game's play conditioning. you can't just blame the playerbase. 
---
Like I said, because I've seen the exact same thing happen to every farm I ever have ran. I listed some of them in the third paragraph in case you missed it. 
---
That's awesome you had a good time!  That's unfortunate about falling behind a zerg.  It's pretty bad when everyone is mounted but you don't have one I imagine.  Before mounts were introduced, commanders would stack and wait for everyone before moving out.  During this time, people continually output swiftness skills.  When you do finally move out, everyone should basically have perma-swiftness (and people will still apply swiftness on the move).  It's pretty different with the mount now though because those classes who previously gave swiftness on the move can't use their skills while mounted.  
---
Frist spirit/spotter can be brought by any ranger (dps soulbeast), not just druid, and GoE is like a 4% DPS boost.
---
Precision has diminishing returns via spotter whereas power never has diminishing returns, which is what makes empower allies so strong, and banners are an absolutely monstrous offensive DPS boost to the group. We're talking 100+ of each stat to the group, on top of empower alleis on a warrior spec that does around 10k more DPS than chronomancer or druid to begin with.
---
Are you from ANET?
---
Kind of did medium and half of light leggy armor atm. 
---
So you should have learned already that nothing stays forever and that you should save money for hard times.
---
If I ever get to the point where I'd rather swipe my credit card than play the game I know I'm not enjoying the game anymore and it's time to move on.
---
Maybe I'm missing something, but why would you want three of those??
---
Actually, this is my livelihood, so I'd say I'm pretty qualified to speak on it. 
---
Your response is sorta like how anti-vaxxers don't listen to what doctors have to say.
---
That's not going to change. If they care about abandoned maps, they'll add incentives that match what players want to them. My guess is they don't really mind abandoned LW maps
---
They can only be used on one character at a time. They aren't skins. If I want multiple toons with the infusion, you have to buy multiple infusions
---
No.
---
With that mindset, you never spend money on anything. 
---
If you have a better routine i'm all ears!!!
---
Sometimes change needs a catalyst, and mounts can be that catalyst for people.  I only really got into WvW during the rewards update.  Not because I really wanted the rewards that much, but because I had been wanting to try it, and I knew there would be a lot of other newbies around.  Now a few years later, WvW is pretty much all I play in GW2.  Some players will stick around, just saying!
---
Ah, I see. Well good luck with the saving.
---
NCSoft West marketing ideas leaking into reddit
---
So you tell me you can spend everything or nothing at all? There is literally no middleground?
---
You could swipe a credit card. For $10 you get 12 hours worth of farming. And that's the issue. 
---
This.... sounds eerily like the lore of Horzion: Zero Dawn.
---
Exactly. I've seen countless people complaining about how hard it is to get warclaw. Like what game are you playing? It's just a reward track. You will probably do all the other achievements and enough tickets from participation while doing that reward track. I don't get it, why is it so hard? You don't need to be skillful in any way, you just need a couple of hours.
---
"Your mockery of my incredibly arrogant and insulting post is equivalent to a widespread conspiracy theory that damages not only our society, but humanity as a whole"
---
Got anymore of them comparisons? You seem to be quite good at those, almost as good as understanding peoples critizism of your """""arguments""""".
---
&gt;You need a shitton of gold to start TP flipping.
---
&gt;I just finished my Home Instance, now I'm saving up for a third Liquid Gold Aurillium.
---
Can any TP barons confirm whether 10kish gold is enough for an entry level position as a TP flipper?
---
Lul, no.
---
Annual engy chili cook off!
---
I miss making fun of Akili as a collective group :( 
---
&gt; This eliminates some of the lingering resentment from having be active to keep participation up. 
---
Anyone who resents the requirements has free choice whether or not they do it. You're free not to farm pips.
---
Do keys ever go on sale? I've only seen them bundled with other stuff.
---
nerfed the number of champions that spawn at each 25% phase on amala fight in great hall from 4/5(based on how large the group is) to hardcap 2.
---
Most likely they created the animation for this frame while they were creating the griffon.  Maybe they originally planned on the griffon moving even slower on land, but increased its speed later and created the running animation to match.  Seems like this heart is the only way to access that intermediary speed and see the trot animation.
---
I was really sad to see so many people complaint about pve players on my server too, people can be fine :/. Really glad you got to see what a lot of us vets really love about the game, being in comms with someone who more and less knows what they're doing makes a big difference. Maybe I'll see you on the battle field in the future ;)
---
maybe they're using two different models ? 1 in wvw and 1 in PVE . cause griffon walks just like that. 
---
I have my secondary drive set to X: because it’s the coolest letter.
---
IIRC yes it can end up being circular so it probably murders the server via infinite loop
---
Well not anymore since it was fixed. :)
---
We took down some walls, turned some camps, killed some yaks, killed some dudes, and kept the enemy busy running after us while the other tag was taking down keeps and stuff. I felt that we were appropriately aggravating. :3
---
nnnice
---
Right and that's why traps aren't useful for the issue
---
I'll never stop upvoting these comics. 
---
That's actually very cute o.O
---
The jackal was also created with this animation but I don't know if they do it in game.
---
"Endgame" moneymaking train in a starting zone? What could go wrong?
---
Warclaw is necessary, because where there are mounts, there are mount skins to sell.
---
Yes, it drops the previous sigils back into your inventory when you socket the new ones.
---
Is the pass really worth it?
---
🤘😸🤘
---
Whoa whoa whoa, hold on there. 
---
I did *not* do any of the sort. 
---
There were legendaries on the trading post, yes, for sale, for a LOT of gold (which I didn't buy, it was cheaper to create them!!)--but there were no whites or whatever, skinned to look like a legendary.
---
I crafted my legendaries! I got my mystic clovers through prospector's stones (a lot of'em!), I leveled my crafters to the appropriate levels to craft the ingots I needed, etc. I farmed the HECK out of ascalon tears for the gifts (I needed 1,000). 
---
I can get multiple people to testify that I *created* my weapons because they were there when I did it!
---
I found that it was helping zergs stick closer together when they were all mounted (no imbalance in runspeed, some classes are slower), and we were more mobile even with a reduced runspeed just because of jumps. Eventually a mounted enemy zerg will catch you in enemy territory over a flat-out run but that's what misdirection, teleports, invis, etc are for.
---
I’m a engi player, we’ve only ever gone from useless trash to broken op ever sense hot

yes twice.... sorry i couldn't be bothered to type an Xtra 2 to express my appreciation for engineer finally getting our spanking.
---
I'm sorry, but I did not PVP that much back then. In fact, my account still shows as a Deer. I created my legendaries, I didn't unlock the skins from any other means. 
---
Yes. If you think it isn't, it probably is.

I streamed a long time ago and uploaded videos on Mesmer builds and provided highlights on how to get your wardens and phantasms to deal damage upwards to 13-15k per hit (back then that was considered a lot). I also did a 12-hour dungeon run with Ren and friends, where we did all dungeons non-stop, flawlessly!  
---
It was many years ago with the old twitch system, so those videos are likely lost. Sorry.
---
Why not?
---
Wish they stopped doing this, nerfing everything good till most maps are empty.   
---
Instead of buffing other content, they just bring whatever's good to level of rest of bad things.   
---
did you just call reaper a beast in pve? wtf
---
&gt;Never saw Anet nerfing something to the ground like that. 
---
Multiloot was more profitable than Istan. Was.
---
Thanks for your suggestion! 
---
I painfully don't want to admit it, but, you're probably right, and this was probably a waste of time. They probably won't do anything for me--because one apple spoils the bunch, right? I wish they did look at my case with fresh eyes, though, without any prior contempt from other players. I wasn't around for any of this garbage that happened, and I'm being punished for it, indirectly. 
---
I remember when I was commanding WvWvW with coral on tarnished toast, and I blinked through walls and cracks to back-door the enemy bases. I was like, "this is a huge exploit". So I put in a ticket and let them know what was going on. I don't know if they ever did anything about it. I haven't tried blinking through cracks since I've been back--but they gave me like 20 black lion chests for reporting the exploit. I don't know... I think customer service back then was probably in a totally different league than it is now. Then again, I hardly ever needed to contact customer support. 
---
Ncsoft has dirty hands now? If not for ncsoft, you would never play guild wars games at all. Nit to mention gw franchise is funded on the corpse of other game.
---
Do you really thing gw "fans" can complain about ncsoft while for years they only benefit on the deal with koreans?
---
The "official report" is that NCSoft did the layoffs and canceled other projects and told anet to strictly focus on GW2 is my understanding. 
---
Other than lay offs the most notable news are the following:
---
1. Balance changes, many classes had nerfs/buffs etc.  
---
2. Warclaw mount - a mount exclusive to wvw  
---
3. Istan nerf - A popular farming meta has been nerfed drastically  
---
I'd rather be more worried about t5 than t6. Those 30k mithril and elder wood won't farm themselves. 
---
There's another one near the WvW gates, telling you some of the lore behind the warclaw.
---
Maybe I need more coffee but how does "What it did was making mats more expensive because there is a lesser supply of those..." make sense? How do you increase the supply of materials like ecto and somehow at the same time make it more expensive?
---
Trying to get back to the game - not sure what to do.
---
I'm Mastery level 68, got some stuff, and I'm on living story 3.
---
I'm thinking of working my way up the living world season before I start the PoF story arc.
---
Got any recommendations on places to do some fun activities beside the living world? I also need to farm Masteries but I'm not sure if I'll find a party for it...
---
&gt;We must be playing at different times
---
Nope, just in different instances
---
Quaggans mounting big cats is the next meta in r/guildwarsgonewild.
---
Except it needs one. Not as hard as Istan but it definitely needs one. SW has a lot of double/triple dipping. Do events, those events rewards items which leads to even more items. At the same time you're gaining a lot of map currency. 
---
[https://imgur.com/a/pIP5S9H](https://imgur.com/a/pIP5S9H) Here you go !
---
&gt; so we form a raid and just spread the love across all the different maps after each meta finishes
---
I like this mentality except the community doesn't do that. They want *one* map that they can farm endlessly hours on end and that's where the issue is.
---
“Foo this kitty has nice teeth!”

---
I gotcha. I wasn't trying to put you down in anyway, so please don't take it as me talking down on you; I was just noting what I saw that made me think you were newer to the game.
---
Thief's survivability can be high, but it's definitely tied to your performance. Making use of the mobility that thief has, or using Sigil of Malice in tandem with the Invigorating Precision trait to get a massive amount of heals back. 
---
Most builds you find online won't reflect this, because their sole focus is on DPS; survivability should be provided by positioning and by your supports in your party. Being that vulnerable takes some getting used to, but once you do thief's potential really shines. The positive part is, the knowledge you get from learning good positioning and mechanics is easily applicable to other classes as well, making you better at the game in general.
---
We are very slowly creeping towards the uncanny valley...

you are wrong

I've seen some pretty dumb shit on the sub but you've taken the gold medal here mate lol

Ahaha, you included me saying "hot" in there
---
I was going to say this. Which dirty deed were they covering up when they discontinued the allowance of multi-instance Octovine loot fiesta?
---
As someone running around with swiftness and signed of locusts the warclaw is significantly faster than me. Pretty sure I could maaaybe keep up with superspeed, but that's a big maybe and hard to maintain anyway
---
You know, something that bothers me, too, is that some of these sets don't seem to be mentioned in game by any of the NPCs. You're just supposed to know it's there and go do stuff for it. But if you're a casual player, how are you supposed to find out these collections exist?
---
I wonder about that sometimes. I've met folks in guilds and squads who don't know how to find things or how to check the wiki to see if they exist, and even though I've been playing consistently for over a year now, there's still stuff I'm finding that I've missed here or there, and then I have to go back and try it again.
---
It feels wasted if its used as reddit bait. Theres much more fun things you could do with it
---
Not a charr background?
---
Sorry, 9/10.
---
The best kind of warclaw
---
My guess would be that it's your character being shown, and no sight of the warclaw. Though it is down there, but still.
---
Your misunderstanding, You could trade legendarys to other characters via transmuting them onto white weapons.
---
This will most likely be the case, an oversight on anets part if you ask me.
---
You have to check open world squads LFG, RIBA groups run frequently through out the day. 
---
You can leave your characters inside and log them in when "necrotic barrier" is down. Join any squad/party on map to make sure that you get into correct instance after swapping characters, but there usually isn't ore than once instance of the map/nobody will take your spot in the time that will take you to swap the map.
---
I’ll add my two cents into this. Again taking the side for thief and their sustain. You literally swap one trait (Invigorating Percision) and take signet of malice and anything that doesn’t one shot you won’t kill you. I know there is a low health pool, but in general PVE few things actually hit for 10-11k. In open world situations where I am solo and want to brain dead farm I’ll even throw on the 66% chance to life steal on crit foods and you can fight as much stuff as you want.
---
Don’t get too focused on “meta” builds. You will hear a lot of people saying that they are struggling with a snowcrows build in open world or some variation of following a build that doesn’t apply to the game mode they are playing (echoing what was said above already). Also watch getting drawn into the “meta” rotations. There are times in open world and even fractals (raids are a different story) that I will use vaults to fill time between dodges, and can more often than not be top dps still. There will come a point in your playing that a class like reaper will lose its luster bc it IS simple to play. While thief doesn’t have much in the way of group utility it has weapons and traits to adapt to many different situations and is one of the few classes with skip/jump mechanics in its tool kit. I have made a lot of different characters all geared to ascended/legendaries and always come back to thief because it’s what I like.
---
TL;DR - play what you like, if you play something only bc it’s the “best” chances are good you will lose interest or better yet it will be nerfed into oblivion.
---
Ya I believe Dagger auto for most classes except Ele have a 2 target cap as well. Infact there's only 2 Dagger skills (out of 33) in the game that have a target cap of 5 people (not including Elementalist skills because they shit AoEs no matter what weapon they use).
---
Hearts only give 1 branded mass though. I'll do the metas. Thx!
---
Hopped on yesterday, found a commander, and flipped a keep in about 10 minutes. Complete novice in the mode, running up to a keep is hardly dangerous, I've noticed defenders typically come from the other side of the keep, if they even show at all. (Also I get that the speed I did it in was pure luck really)
---
(TC here too) I joined discord with PURR, my first time on voice chat in WvW, to get the kitty. Since getting it, I've been running with them most nights after. Commanders *are* willing to teach nubs (mind you I did some research before going into WvW and have builds for Herald and Scourge that are within the normal variance of meta), but Commanders aren't willing to teach nubs by spending minutes typing things out.
---
If you're a beginner to WvW but think there's a chance you'll enjoy the mode, dip into voice. If the commander / squad is obnoxious you can just leave.

Nice!
---
Yup.  The game is in a good spot right now.  Since you already have the core game, start it up and get used to it again.  Buy the expansions and if you want a super continuous story, the living world seasons.  Things may go on sale this month so it will worth waiting for that.  If you don't care about story or it's too much to spend up front, you can use gold to gems to buy the loving world seasons later.
---
Warclaw currently is the one of the slowest mounts and about equivalent to constant Swiftness.
---
Yea people without the Warclaw will be in the back, but who actually wants to go first in an army?
---
Next time I'm at Charrbucks, I'll request some Asura Ear Milk.
---
I just came back after 3.5\~ years and am having a bunch of fun.
---
Out of curiosity, how? I had no issue with the objectives or even the tickets but the reward track seems pretty time gated. I've spent like 3-4 hours with 90% tier 6 participation and I'm like 60% done
---
Years*
---
&gt;Yea people without the Warclaw will be in the back,
---
It's not that; it's more that over WvW distances, if you travel from a place A to place B, your group might have arrived and taken the destination before you even get there. It's happened to me twice tonight alone.
---
This’s what happens to everything that gets nerfed in Guild Wars 2. It’s people’s own fault for complaining and getting what they asked for. Maybe be carful what you ask for people or stop complaining!
---
what does ap have to do with being a good player?
---
These words are falling on deaf ears. It’s much easier for people to blame the druid than accept they’re bad players. 
---
Well, personally if I were to make a tierlist for gemstore purchases, I'd place it somewhere between copper-fed salvage and shared slots you want to put those two in.
---
You get all craftings, all important merchants, forge and a fractal lobby in one place that is small and is not a part of a bigger map, making it load faster XD
---
What a great argument!
---
Best piece of advice I can give to a fellow nub. Find a commander, stick to them hard they know what they're doing and like 90% of them aren't assholes. Mostly I've been learning through osmosis while zerging.

You're assuming they don't care. It's your statement. They don't care. They're slowing everyone down because they don't care, not because they're not capable. I'm not making an assumption about you. I'm basing my opinion of you by exactly what you said...your assumption.
---
Now if you didn't mean that, or you misrepresented how you feel, that's fine. But it's 100% an assumption that, these people don't care. You're painting all the people who don't listen with one brush and I'm relatively sure most of them would care if they understood what there was to care about. But most of those people have never been to reddit. They don't know that it's part of playing the game to do some basic research. They don't know that they have to listen to a bunch of players to play the game. And how those players interact with them in the first place can turm them off for good. 
---
If you hadn't made the statement that they slow everyone down because they don't care, you'd not have heard from me. But you said it and you can't back it up...thus it's an assumption.
---
You'll miss season 1. Everything else can be attained now, so you'll be able to buy Season 2, Season 3, Season 4 from what you've missed and the two expansions. Missing Season 1 is unfortunate, but not game breaking. 
---
The game is easy to catch up in compared to most MMOs I've played.

Pressing V now, sir

Agreed, wonder if imob should be allowed as well.. Although removing stealth is harsh, it's still a mechanic of the game

I don't see it very viable. Of course the price is outragaeous, but anet can't go fixing all the time every item priced with laurels or other similar currency that can also be purchased on TP.
---
The tragedy of Darth Istan the Rich.
---
I get what you mean with 3.5k-4k AP. Players who are fairly new to T4. I improved a lot over time and it's good that you try to teach them.
---
I just want to add that I, with ~6.7k achievements points, had more bad experiences with high AP (10k+) players than with low AP ones. My most memorable experience is us trying to burst Subject 6 in Thaumanova and after ~6 failed tries people leave. A ~13k AP dps messages that Holo(me)+DH(him) can't have enough burst and calls me a dummy. I have Arcdps and did 30k beginning dps and a stable ~25k dps afterwards while he started with 11k dps and declined to 8k. He also thought I'm bad for not dodging attacks of subject 6. He didn't realize the Druid can out heal in favor for more dps. I only called out his low dps after he said I was the problem. Otherwise a surprising amount of high AP don't know some /gg skips.
---
It could be that the player skill level also depends a bit on the group comp. 1 Healer+4 dps would indicate a more casual group while Druid+Chrono/Firebrand+Ren and 3 pdps would indicate a more serious group.
---
Anyway, overall I don't have many huge issues with my teammates in Tier 4 despite low/high AP of them. 
---
&gt;It is mentality of players that needs to be changed.
---
Then give the game content that isn't tied to how much gold you've made, that isn't just collections galore.
---
I know, idealistic, but what people I've seen want.
---
And then complain when the new map isn't as profitable.
---
&gt; When you don't know what to do in a Fractal, ask! Most ppl are nice and like to explain stuff.
---
this goes for anything. Worst case you get yelled at and made to feel bad. Every other time no one will say anything and you gain/lose nothing and the rest of the time you might just learn something. 
---
&gt; Read instabilities before the fractal, maybe you need to adapt...
---
I had a teammate the other day complain that the supp should be outhealing the dmg they were tanking on mama because they were standing in the rings and eating last laugh dmg with frailty on. After the group was reminded face tanking everything is a bad idea things went smoothly.
---
What you say is true, though this is Fashion wars.  (I say that having never dyed gear.)   Black Lion keys can get you cool stuff.  I got a mount skin from my 10 keys.  That skin alone was 2k gems.  
---
I don't spend money on gems either.  It did take me a while to save up that 2k gems...
---
&gt;  a cheapo portal to Grove

Wait what? More details please, I want that portal!
---
I honestly don't think an MMO getting people to buy expansions is an issue here. They want to play the game they should buy the expansion. That's how it works in almost every other MMO. You can't even level to max in most MMOs without buying the next expansion.
---
People don't realize how generous this free to play is. There must be some advantages or encouragement to buy expansions.
---
That said, I don't think the people who really play WvW seriously haven't bought the expansion already in any numbers.
---
My worst case scenario here is that most people who didn't own the expansion before will find a way to get it now, which isn't bad for the game. The few people left who don't? I can't see why that should be an issue for people who are actively supporting the game.
---
Nice, I was just curious since I'm currently running valkyrie reaper  (which I know isn't meta) and doing surprisingly well for myself. Was curious if it'd be an easy switch or if I'd need to regear.
---
same bro same
---
Looking at HWMonitor, What would be considered overheating? 
---
It's not a story Anet would tell you.
---
No direct correlation imo. Moreso an expression of time with the game I guess. Personally I've seen 2k ap very competent raiders and shitty 20k ap DPS. 
---
Gliders are mostly just a convenience item, esp
---
I have a gazillion Bloodstone Ore and Dragonite that I still haven't made use of despite all these years
---
Can I just destroy these
---
so these godawful shitpost "comics" (and i use that term as loosely as possible) are... improving the quality of the sub? 
---
Those 2k ap experienced players are alt accounts
---
Stop telling people how to play the game they payed for i love going into fractals and die. Same much as going full zerker ranger into wvw. 
---
Just joking ... cant agree more that people can just ask in every game mode and improve by the help of veterans.
---
....most are either sold or closed.
---
So wait, we don't get to use the account bound mounts and gliders in WvW?
---
Thank you!!
---
The fact that this is core only really excites me! Will be very different and interesting 
---
No, they're an example of it slipping.
---
i can't understand why anet wouldn't allow f2p players to use elite specs in wvw exclusively. Just limit their use to wvw. That would be a way to easily encourage players to purchase the expansions.
---
Yes you're right but I still don't like how the shorter leap feels. It was so fluent and fun before! Now it's just a short hop...
---
What I would like to see changed:
---
1) Health reduced by ~2.5k.
---
2) Maul dismounts enemies on hit.
---
3) Cripple, chill and immobilize slow down the mount by ~33% and reduce the leap distance by the same amount. They don't stack.
---
4) While mounted you are permanently revealed.
---
5) Increase the leap distance back to 900 and fix the map exploits! At 600 range it just doesn't feel good anymore.

Starting your journey to take down the Elder Dragons, huh? But due to our new rules the questions must be left in the [&gt;questioning session&lt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/search?q=title%3Aquestions+thread+author%3AAutoModerator&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week). We have plenty of experienced historians there that can guide you on your first steps.
---
warclaw requires only one rank point investment to unlock, one camp, one tower, one keep &amp; a few guard kills, plus the playtime to complete a reward track (can be as little as 4 hours with boosts)  
---
Yes, without a warclaw, you might find yourself trailing the mounted group, but in all likelihood you will be able to get your warclaw within at most a couple of days of dedicated play. And many WvW guilds are new-player friendly and will make sure that everyone in the guild is with their group before they capture an objective.  
---
Besides which, if the group is assaulting a t3 objective or even just an objective the enemy is actively defending, the likelihood of them reaching it, breaking in, and capping it before even the slowest players arrive is pretty slim. Worst case scenario is that they get there and get wiped out before you can catch up, potentially sparing you a painful and humiliating death and the need to respawn.
---
99 bugs in the lines of the code, 99 bugs in the code.  Take one down, patch it around, now Warclaw pounce shoots ballista arrows from his mouth.
---
I'm heading back to gw2 and it's been a while.
---
Can you guys help me on what to do at lvl 80?
---
Because when I login I dunno really what to do :( 
---
I had no idea what to do. I'm a 100% solo, casual player. No friends in game, no guilds, etc.
---
So I watched a few videos about what the heck WvW was, more importantly how to start the reward track for the mount.
---
My first night, 3 nights ago, I queue up and get started. I see a couple of people nearing a commander on map and head that way. And the group starts to grow. 
---
We head up a hill towards a tower. I see one blue team solo lad, and kill him. "Wow this is easy.."
---
And then a massive sea of blue players (I understand this is known as a zerg) came out of no where and steamrolled the shit out of me. Instant death. 
---
So far I'm having a good time, and apologize to anyone I'm following around for tremendously sucking. 
---
Invasion
---
and then everyone started clapping
---
Well it's still not a good look for anyone who is new to the game or coming back to have this huge announcement about layoffs on the header of every page. 
---
Warclaw straight turned all WvW related content into spaghetti code and I am not sure how.
---
Lots of people are regarding the warclaw as the final nail in the coffin for WvW, but the last couple of nights we haven't even seen any real shift in the previous meta, which was the very minimum of my predictions of what would occur. I still think it will change the meta up, but It's hardly going to be the death of the game mode, and contrary to other people's feelings, i think it could actually ease new players into the game mode more, as they won't suddenly find themselves in a game where the mounts they've grown accustomed to are completely absent.
---
Problem with 3 is thay they will need to change how mounts work then. Because right now mount ls don't get affected with any movements affecting skill
---
Try backing up your arcdps.ini (just in case you have any custom settings or keybinds) then delete it or replace with the one on Delta's site, restart the game, close the game, then replace the arcdps.ini with your backup.
---
&gt; Also here is a fun fact a lot of you Istan defenders like to ignore. In the GH meta the end goal is to kill Amala but what happens? You went out of your way to stack as many people as possible to spawn Champs and proceed to farm them. So rather than do the event like normal you decide to exploit the event.
---
I'm sorry but is your argument that using a full map the get the rewards that come with using a full map an exploit? Like you want to be taken seriously when you say that playing with as many people as possible to obtain the rewards that were designed by the developers with the very thing in mind in an exploit? 
---
I really dont think its the farmers that dont have any hope friend. 
---
I like to think the layoffs were caused by the istan farm.
---
done :) For future reference, modmail is more likely to get our attention! But all good! 
---
Copy pasta.
---
Hearts allow 5 per day, per char. Each meta is 5 per day per char. the hidden chests are 1 per day each (for a total of 24 per reset) &amp; you can mine some predefined number from the nodes is the zone - they'll respawn after a while if you haven't yet hit that number. Each map completion nets you 25, once off per character.
---
This shit is straight trash
---
I can't speak for all the mods, but I certainly don't read every line in every channel in discord. If you want our attention, you can ping us. Better yet, reach out to us via modmail. It's not that we're ignoring you, we have no idea you're talking to us! :) 
---
The game is really alt friendly. No worries in making endless amounts of characters. If you decide to delete one, no problem, you aren't wasting anybody's time with that.  
---
This is dope, love it jeBRO
---
A minute of silence for Istan.
---
The banner CSS stuff is all witchcraft to me, but I'll poke the others who are smarter at this stuff. Quick quesiton though, are you on old reddit or new reddit? I remember a comment a little while ago from one of our code-y people that said that they're just dealing with old-reddit appearances. But like I said, I'll try and find out what's up. :) 
---
This would be an excellent solution to helping new WvWers get their own mounts and yet keep up with the zerg.
---
No, as they are harder to balance and would damage the game mode pretty hard. Warclaw only.
---
Ummmm, have you made sure your account is secure?
---
!redditsilver
---
A difference in experience if you mean playtime, then sure.  But not competency.
---
Problem is that there's not much to do besides killing mobs after finishing the story :/ 
---
Usually in MMOs playing what's rewarding AND fun, but here we only have one or the other, and fun wears out quickly without the thrill of reward. Games like Monster Hunter or Dauntless keep the player literally killing the same thing over 60 times a week and it's still fun because you keep unlocking things and being rewarded.
---
Honestly that'd be really neat. They could use similar effects to the existing Mistfire Wolf.
---
I noticed that everyone gave you great advice for all slots except back.

VERY easy collections for those who have completed the PoF campaign. Just check which group you supported in the campaign, and complete that collection. The hardest part is a bounty, as I recall. 
---
By having immense financial success for nearly 15 years. 
---
It's a very different gamemode. Personally i really like WvW despite an unabiding hatred of sPvP.  
---
I'd say give it a chance, though, if you do enjoy normal pvp. Roaming is a lot more similar to actual sPvP and has gotten a boost thanks to the mounts. Zerg play is quite a different beast but it's great fun taking an organised group and smashing through a disorganised blob half again your size (or even bigger, in the case of SoS)
---
Pretty sure F2P players can use gliding in wvw tho?
