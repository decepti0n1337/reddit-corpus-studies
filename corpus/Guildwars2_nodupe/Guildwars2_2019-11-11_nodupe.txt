OP should've used that one fight scene in the last GoT season where the undead fight at night.

I cam confirm happens on NA as well most of the lag issues i see are in PoF maps and AB in HoT map

Also, that not how food poisoning works.

Cosmetics are subjective.  Pick the look that you want and can afford.

are you forgetting the foot lettuce incident?

I really like Whisper's Secret light armor, but I don't know that it fits with any class specifically.
---
This is a case of one of the badly designed events that are needed for stuff, but require failure.

thanks :)

Before the *"""""template"""""* update, it was not possible to equip elite spec weapons without equipping the elite spec trait line.   
---
Now, when an elite spec weapon is equipped without equipping the elite spec, the skills will appear grayed.  
---
If you equip the hammer but got no abilities, that means you didn't really equip the scrapper elite specialization, and you haven't equipped the hammer before while having scrapper equipped, so your character never learned the hammer skills, and when you equip the hammer there will be no skills at all. 
---
Equip the scrapper elite specialization in the elite trait slot (the one with the gold borders at the bottom of the build panel, ), then equip the hammer, and your character will learn the skills.
---
I find that if you call Skritt out in map chat during peak times there'll always be people interested.
---
As for the bow, you just gotta knuckle down and get the huntsman level done.
---
I used magician leggings/aristocrat (human cultural) top/cabalist boots when running around as 2B, I think. Easy to get for a new player.
---
I could have told you that a mini in gw2 wasn't worth eating at quiznos without seeing this post.  
---
That's not a shot at quiznos specifically btw.  Its just that the mini really isn't worth much and fast food made of highly processed meat isn't anything special.
---
I ran into a weird bug like this yesterday with a character that I had unlocked all of the scrapper traits/skills on, but had never equipped a hammer to.
---
Re-equipping my hammer once unlocked skills 1-4, and re-equipping it again unlocked skill 5.
---
Can someone explain to me (I don't raid) why the firebrands gear isn't full viper but a mix of viper sinister and grieving? What stat breakpoints are they trying to hit?
---

---
Went with Priory's historical set rlly like the look and went with a gold and purple dye set
---
My original post was stating that Anet is making missteps again and that things aren’t likely to change. Which is unfortunate because it would be more beneficial for everyone if they made changes with all the different types of players in mind. No, you can’t please everyone but they can do a much better job than they have been recently.
---
For whatever reason you decided to hop on and just tell me, “no, you are wrong, basically shut up”.
---
You didn’t really have anything of value to add to the conversation and I don’t understand why you defend bad practices.
---
So once again, why did you brother to pipe in? You just wanted to tell me off?
---
Because your main damage is mostly just burning,  so you try to cap the condition duration of burning only. You get already 20% from the trait in Radiance + 50% from superior rune of Balthazar, which makes it to 70% Burning duration + 4,66% from food ( plate of beef rendang ) -&gt; 74,66% so that means you are only missing 25,34% Condition duration, you get the remaining expertise exactly from 1 viper pants, 2 viper rings , 1 Viper backpiece , 1 Viper Trinket and Viper weapons. The rest is then a mix of sinister and grieving stats which apparently provides us with the most damage output.  
---
Edit: oh the Nike video does explain it also quite well. Definitely worth to watch it.
---
Right...and how many of those game's primary audience can be classified as "ultra" casuals...and what portion of the population are they?
---
With all those Fb's did u guys vane near perma aegis?
---
This place does not reflect the actual player base.  A very tiny fraction of the total population even use this sub, and it's for the best too with the state of it currently.  I don't even come here as often as I used to because it's become so trash lately.
---
Awesome, great explanation thanks!
---
That limit only stops those with low comment karma. If you have accrued a good amount of karma, you can comment a decent amount of times, 5+, before getting a 5 minute restriction.
---
Edit: MMO's are definitely dying for sure. Personally, I am hoping the west gets Lost Ark; that is why I included it :P.
---
Is no one going to actually look at the OP?
---
r/GW2 is not the Guild Wars 2 subreddit and redirects here, r/Guildwars2.
---
r/lol is not the League of Legends subreddit and certainly does not currently have 24.1K viewers. It has 25.
---
r/Neverwinter does not currently have 423K. It has 464.
---
r/Guildwars2 currently has 954.
---
That is not to mention, current users online means nothing. Lets look at total subscribers.
---
r/Guildwars2 has 219K.
---
r/ffxiv has 306K. Not that much more.
---
r/wow has 1.2M. Not surprising for one of the most popular MMOs.
---
r/leagueoflegends has 3.4M. Not surprising for one of the most popular games in the world.
---
r/gtaonline has 322K. But its not full of shitposts like this post so that makes sense.
---
r/blackdesertonline has 126K.

r/Neverwinter has 34K.

r/elderscrollsonline has 230K.

r/lostarkgame has 22K.

Dunno how meta it is but the wooden potatos Scrapper Flamethrower build is my goto.

this is so yikes
---
Ok, my bad. I was using the auto reddit r/ thing. My numbers ARE accurate when I went to the actual reddits. Formatting screwed me over here.
---
I worked in a macdonalds here in QLD australia where the employees would continually spit in the food and place cockroaches into certain machines, this above does not surprise me at all..
---
No i did not eat the food we prepared.. And no i didn't do it.
---
I agree with you. We do have to ask ourselves though if the reports NCsoft publishes are truly unbiased or meant to show profitable stability for sake of appearance.
---
You can list a job offering for .00001000000000000000000000000 *million* dollars an hour, and tell people you pay people in millions, but no one does that because it's bullshit.
---
They're a public company reporting sales. Nothing to do with unbaised. If a company is underperforming NcSoft will say so and has.  Guild Wars 2 slightly underperformed, according to NcSoft a few years back, but has been okay since, or at least they haven't again said they've underperformed.
---
Because I have played the other games and have taken the exact same casual approach in each. I realize that is only empirical. That being said, every one of these games puts out patches on the same day (Tuesday). This provides a little weight to the accuracy of comparison. Ideally, I would assign a weighted value to what is released on each patch day and scale the numbers accordingly. My goal of posting on a Sunday was to avoid any escalated numbers resulting from a 'patch day' given that all patches are different in terms of content.
---
A very good point. That being said, games in general, especially MMOs, have a considerable time commitment variable that younger people would be more inclined to participate in. I will use this as a confounding factor when I do this study again on Tuesday (general patch day).
---
I still can't get anyone to kill Deimos with me even once ._.
---
Steve Blum voices Rytlock. So anything he narrates can be story time with Rytlock? Hmm.
---
Right because analysts don't care about social network engagement.
---
Comments like the ones you're replying to are the reason I never read replies. People are just so fucking dense, there's no point engaging with them.
---
I'm pretty sure you are describing the flaw in your own argument. "In the strawman argument, someone attacks a position the opponent doesn't really hold. ... You can imagine how strawman arguments and ad hominem fallacies can occur together, demonizing opponents and discrediting their views. With the strawman argument, someone attacks a position the opponent doesn't really hold." (first search in google using straw man vs ad hominem).
---
If you go by reddit numbers, there is a website already made to do that, including history and it's own algorithm to extrapolate actual player count. 
---
https://mmo-population.com/
---
&gt;We do have to ask ourselves though if the reports NCsoft publishes are truly unbiased or meant to show profitable stability for sake of appearance.
---
1. I said "if". 
---
2. This is Anet we are talking about, they are already bleeding out and they lost investor confidence a long time ago.
---
Thought I was the only one! It started a few days ago actually and it's getting worse.
---
You have no idea what Anet lost or hasn't lost. Players are not investors. And no one invests in Anet. Anet doesn't sell stock seperately. They invest in NcSoft.  You're horribly uniformed about this. The company is public on the Korean stock exchange. None of the investors particularly care about Anet. They care about Lineage, the main game of the company.
---
This is really neat, thank you. Really interesting correlation to notice here. I said Gw2 had about half as many people as ESO. This website absolutely confirms that. I also said Gw2 had 1/5th the population of FFXIV and WOW. This website also confirms that. Same is true for my measurement comparison to BDO.
---
\[Endless Duck Tonic\]?
---
S/S Shiro Revenant, Condi Mirage, and S/D Power Weaver are all super good at this. Lots of blink to enemy, blink to point, or dodge away.
---
How does this lend credence to the claim? Of COURSE a person working for less than minimum wage is going to not give a flying fuck about food sanitation unless the boss is looking. That's a far cry different from a manager at an orientation specifically saying to go ahead and do the shitty thing,
---
You don't know the overall player population and the amount of players on reddit may or may not reflect that. If all you're doing is saying well there are less people on reddit, so there are less people playing, I'd say there's a chance that's true. There's also a chance that's not true. Considering how reddit represents a small percentage of the playerbase, and this is a casual game to the point of ridiculous, it's likely most of the playerbase never looks at reddit at all.
---
Sure, it's possible you're right. But there's no QED here.
---
If he only wants the gift of battle, I'm not sure moving to another server is the best option, not cheap at all
---
My study is equivalent to a presidential poll. They take a tiny sample of the population in order to predict results. It is not scientifically accurate, but it has a means of providing a window of viewing the actual population. I don't know if I have already responded to you but https://mmo-population.com/ corroborates almost perfectly with my data set.
---
It's not the same. Because you're not pollling everyone, only the people on reddiit, who are a subset. The presidental poll calls people randomly. The reddit population is hardly a random population as a representative of the game. And we've seen presidential polls be grossly wrong anyway. So again. Shrugs.
---
I'll run with you in EotM in Americas just to get some progress on the achievements. Cronos.6532
---
if he's never moved then it's free for the first time - also only relevant for WvW so if he doesn't WvW much there's no loss there
---
Absolutely.
---
Yes, I have it since last month. I couldn't finish first PoF story instance on alt account because of disconnects.
---
Try tracert with gw2's map ip when it lag to check routes.
---
They really do need to offer an alternative way of earning these that do not involve WvW.
---
If those people are such "ultracasuals", should they even have a full weight in counting them towards game's population?
---
I worked at a Quizno's for 2 years in HS, we were not allowed to serve floor food.
---
No, they don't.
---
You are on Blackgate and you do have a problem with WvW population? That is hard to believe.
---
It made sense back when they hoped people would play all three modes, but that dream died many years ago. It's unreasonable to force so many players to grind away at WvW for no other reason than to get a Gift of Battle for their Legendary weapons. It's even harder to do now than it was before!
---
I feel for the multitude of players who avoid WvW and have to go through it for the gift. As others have pointed out, all you need is participation, which can be a camp/sentry/dolyak from time to time. Not to mention the reward track potions and reward track bonuses you can stack.
---
so you are quoting numbers you have no idea about how they became to be to prove some kind of point?
---
Right, again, WvW participation should not be required *at all.* There should be alternate methods for avoiding it entirely.
---
nah, it didn't show anything since the patch went live. it's just another indicator of how entirely untested and unpolished the templates were, or rather that the live servers and customers are their beta/QA environement.
---
To each their own i guess, cos I too personally hate it that i have to get t6, clovers, and map explore for my legendary when all I want to do is wvw and pvp.
---
&lt;sigh&gt;That topic comes up so often.&lt;/sigh&gt; If you think those few hours WvW are beneath you when obtaining a legendary item, maybe talk about the days for map completion first. Or all the other requirements that cannot just simply be bought. Then talk about the cost of those that can and look at WvW rewards.
---
No one is forced to play WvW. You are free not to make that legendary. But if you want to wear legendary, maybe some experience should be connected to it.
---
Also:
---
&gt; you have no other interest in the mode
---
How can you know, without having played it at least for a few hours? That's the whole point.
---
users posting on a subreddit in the last 15 minutes is a bad metric for the health of a game because they could be posting for all the wrong reasons (imagine that stat after the Blizzard HK disaster).
---
Exactly. Plus, it does help your server as well. Big zergs are nice, but those roamers like you (and often me as well) are just as important.
---
Countires and places are different. 
---
For example, here Subway doesn't even require any medical checkup before starting to work there, and old/expired products are literally just mixed up with new ingredients, or have their date label reprinted with a new date.
---
I have 8 extra gift of battles just sitting in my bank and I get them from just doing WvW dailies and repeating the reward track and also you can just join a Zerg in prime time to keep your participation up along with some boosters and then you can it less than a day. 
---
I often refer to it as the “gift of afk” capture monuments repeatedly while watching Netflix with some boosters
---
So, your argument is: just because some people do not like "requirement X" for a ***legendary*** item, there should be an alternative that they like more? With that argument, you'll quickly be able to buy anything with gold/money, because you'll always have those that do not like to bother with anything else.
---
Simple "dislike" for something isn't a good reason for an alternative method. High difficulty would be, or requirement to be on specific servers, or something similar. I see none of these here. Obtaining the gift is really, really simple. It is also by no means a large part in the rest of the legendary. And it is a ***legendary***, so you should expect some effort and time invested into different parts of the game.
---
This is the fist event in a chian; no failure is required. IT still works, but only sometimes. OP should have found a patrolling grawl troop somewhere in Martyr's Woods after hearing in the NPC.
---
It’s comically easy to keep up T6 participation when running around solo.
---
But things changed, one year ago /r/elderscrollsonline had 30k less subscribers than /r/Guildwars2 . Today it has 10k more.
---
/r/ffxiv had same number subscribers 2 years ago as /r/Guildwars2, now it has almost 90k more.
---
&gt; Its a lot easier than getting the 500 badges if you don't WvW
---
You get 600 by the time you reach 2000 AP
---
no
---
Blackgate is currently at T4 if i recall correctly, seems they are tanking on purpose so they can fight lower tier servers, they will probably start climbing up soon again.
---
&gt; But in principle, sure, who would argue otherwise? 
---
I would. I wouldn't like map completion removed either, even if you are only interested in WvW.
---
Thief
---
He means DH I think. As a DH you typically use Litany of Wrath, which is on a 25 second cooldown and allows you to heal for 25% of the damage you do for 6 seconds. For when you are bursting, this essentially gives you full heals for its duration.
---
On top of this, you have f3 which blocks all attacks from front for 3 seconds and allows you to dps as normal. There is also f2 which is a chunky heal. As a DH, Scepter would also be one of your weapons of choice which provides you with range in case melee is inhospitable (e.g. pugs, open world).
---
true game is dead they milk casuals before they close it like wildstar.Dont waste your time and make it faster the process.
---
Agreed - it's personal choice but I prefer core necro over reaper for survivability because of the trait which puts you intro shroud (life force replaces health) when you drop below the health threshold.
---
Plus with another trait minions can stack carapace (+toughness)  which is super useful
---
That volatility right after placements has always been there. 
---
Maybe play a few more games.
---
You are right. But then - what do we talk about here? If GoB isn't required, what is all the fuss about?
---
&gt; and then kept having to play it
---
they can stop playing any time they want, if they dont like it.
---
If players dont like wvw or any other part that is required to craft a legendary weapon, they can purchase a gen 1 legendary off the trading post.
---
For gen2 weapons, the majority of the player base wanted them to be account bound, so players couldnt buy them with a credit card.
---
If you ask for account bound legendary rewards, dont complain about account bound requirements.
---
&gt; I really would like you to design a game, in which everything can be earned by doing anything you like. 
---
I have, it seems to be doing ok. 
---
&gt;And everyone should agree that all methods to obtain something are fairly weighted.
---
Balancing things *perfectly* is hard. Balancing things *imperfectly* but *fairly* is easier. I mean, do people all agree that all rewards *currently* in GW2 are balanced perfectly? Of course not. You have plenty of rewards where people claim that they are easier or harder than they should be, so "perfection" is not a realistic goal. 
---
I think when it comes to something like this, the target wouldn't be to make an alternative to WvW that would be *perfectly balanced* against the current method, but more likely one that would be designed to be *worse* than the current method, by any attempt at an objective standard. It should take more time, more activity, etc. Anyone who at all enjoys WvW should be able to go "yeah, WvW is clearly the best way to do this." But the alternative exists *as an alternative,* so that someone who doesn't enjoy WvW would at least have the *option* of doing something else instead, hopefully one that they would enjoy more. 
---
&gt;You cannot have it both ways. The GoB is not tradeable. If it is a required part, then you are by definition not able to buy the legendary on the TP. 
---
But you *can* buy the Legendary on the TP. That is already a fact. 
---
My point is, if you're willing to do all the *other* aspects of unlocking a Legendary weapon, there should be a way to cross off that last requirement without having to do WvW if you don't enjoy WvW.
---
The two options should not be "pay gold for the entire process, even if you're willing to do most of it," or "do WvW, even if you don't enjoy it."
---
&gt;Btw: please show me the legendary weapon you can simply buy on the TP. I might just do so.
---
[Sure, here's a list.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Legendary_weapon)
---
Gift of battle should be PVP also...
---
&gt; I don't even know what that means.
---
so you complaining about stuff you dont know about, thanks for your feedback.
---
Survive everything = 0 damage
---
I am going to confirm the healthpool... kinda. I was playing full Valk power reaper in open world and I had 29k HP + 24k life force. That means you can easily hit over 50k "HP" while still have alot of DPS and some utility. Full zerker will have 19k health + 15k life force and the life force numbers will be wee lower if you don't use soul reaping traitline.
---
I would suggest OP to try Holosmith, Spellbreaker or Dragonhunter if necro is not your cup of tea.
---

In terror, every time I'm trying to do door or carving achievements in the labyrinth.
---
That would be guardian 100%, DH and FB have the most survivability and are often the backbone of team comps(healbrand or condi quickbrand). DH is just the easiest class to dps with. Given the amount of aegis you have.
---
Me too.
---
At times I never visit this sub even though it has progressed to a real sub instead of a banal "look at my screen cap of," or, "look at this cool picture I drew," sort of a place.  I read the Eve Online sub more than this one even though I have been winning that game for more than 4 years.  It is just more interesting to read about than guildwars.
---
Off. The bloom is horrible.
---
Post processing off, reshade on
---
whats the problem here? the amount of points you're losing? you just finished placements. your ranking is very volatile so you're losing a lot of points. has always been like this in any matchmaking algorithm ever including lol,dota,csgo and overwatch. but I guess those are broken too huh
---
particularly the desolation.

The Arc Templates and "Build templates" was the last straw for a lot of people I know.

Tempest spec shoulder, weaver spec gloves fit very well to ele style.

Guard if you can abuse your active utilities.   If we're talking about passive defense (base HP) then Warrior or Necromancer.
---
...which is?
---
Maybe play unranked more to get better instead of fucking up games for others.
---
Ok pal sure but that doesn't decide it other team had 3 plays whereas I had 3 Silver's it's not balanced and you're probs not good anyways
---
Underrated subreddit.
---
Necro. Unkillable in most content because of massive barriers or creeps to take aggro. Decent DPS in all modes, but frankly, every other class just flatlines at the slightest resistance. Guardian is a close second, but the fact that Necro is considered raid meta for either dps or healing is really indicative of its suitability.
---
It would be the same if guard was good for many years from now on and the game was still as interesting as years ago, first will probably not happen and latter definitely never.
---
French time is currently UTC+1/GMT+1 (known as CET or Central European Time). So your 4.30pm will be 3.30pm UTC.
---
CST is 6 hours behind UTC, so the event will be at 9.30am CST.
---
Open the Friends menu, go to the LFG tab and look for a category called 'Domain of Vabbi'. Pretty sure the commander will list their squad there before the event.
---
Join the squad, right-click the commander's icon in the party menu (usually the person in subgroup 2) and join their instance if you're not in it already.
---
9.30 am CST.

I read it as 'logging' (like woodcutting) at first and got way to confused as to why the commander would write a poem to some elder wood stump or something.
---
I disabled the bloom effect completely in the Gw2Hook Reshade and it looks so much better, less cheap you know. And you get to keep all the other effects.
---
It is below under specification.
---
Its usefull in every gamemode. Good in raids, awesome in fracs, Meta in wvw. It has a Ton of different builds for basically everything. 
---
- Power DH
---
- Condi FB
---
- Healbrand
---
- Power QFB
---
- Condi QFB
---
- Heal QFB
---
And thats only pve.
---
So guard is Like a M16A3 in BF3, an allrounder.
---
Matthias is doing his best, ok??
---
Where does no shaders look better?
---
still good enough if the square are large enough.  suppose you search different kind of games. i'm ok with think and monster hunter world. 
---
it's not the size but how it's filled
---
I don't think I was.
---
Also, thanks for perfectly encapsulating the toxicity I just mentioned.
---
I'd like to see them too!
---
Could be a goose.
---
not just dh! guard has been a staple of pvp/wvw meta since the game exists, perhaps with very few exceptions..first as core heal guard and then as firebrand
---
I would say it's been dead for many years ;)
---
Go make a legendary and tell us how casual it is again.
---
depends on your games goal. milk people? then ultra casuals with money are worth 1,5 hardcore players
---
Feel free to explain how they work to OP then
---
Oof :(
---
Off because of Reshade.
---
I really enjoyed League for a while. Much more friendly community, though this could be because there are simply more players.
---
Since it's only been on the gem store 2 times and each time was during the anniversary.. 100% accurate.
---
While I do visit this sub from time to time in the hope to find some good news, there never is none. I quit playing when they fucked their playerbase with the live event and so did pretty much my whole guild. It's a fun game but with little to no meaningful content or changes it has gotten boring.
---
Guessing by OP's lack of communication they already figured it out..
---
_"I'm immortal all the time, 50% of the time!"_
---
But it has to be one of Snargle's books
---
legendaries are kinda casual, just because u gotta spend time doesnt mean it isn't casual. Seriously there is no effort needed to get a legendary just time.
---
As most are saying, I’d say guardian. The survivability is why I main guard. Litany of wrath is super strong in a full dps set. And DH and FB are amazing builds.
---
Koreans are dedicated hardcores, GW2 is not a game for them.
---
The skritt is easy to solo. If you have a condi build, cc and burst it with condi. The poor thing will melt while running.
---
One thing is what the devs intended the item to do, and another what the item should do.
---
For example, the "build storage" is intended to be 24 paid slots, but it *should* have an alternate way put that list in 'client-side' mode, to save them locally in your computer, with unlimited slots like a folder structure.
---
As players we should always say what things should be, least devs forget it.
---
Hellfire armor. You can only get it farming... AP. 30k AP specifically.
---
Is it just me or did this subreddit get a lot quieter? With only a bit of scrolling I was already at posts from 3 days ago
---
China only sold about 5mil copies though and the game pretty much died after 6 months.
---
Because Anet already had to re do the game to fit the Chinese market adding in the VIP system and so forth. Also we don't know if NCSoft would be the people to distribute it in Korea they could outsource it to a different publisher.
---
This is helpful and interesting. Thank you!
---
Looks like I'll be busy reading on my lunch break. Thanks!
---
Also a good choice.  🦅
---
Yes, if it reads GW2.exe memory.
---
ARC DPS has a special pass from Anet.  Anet's fault, ARC dev did some really nice work.
---
NCSOFT earn 90% of their revenue in Korea with their MMOs no matter of just 50m population vs the whole world. In 2Q 2019 their revenue was 25m in EU/NA and 310m in Korea.
---
Exactly what goes through my head every single time.
---
Piece names?
---
Stow weapon.
---
There is no absolute answer to this. It depends on your playstyle and your game content.
---
If you are looking straight for Max DPS, you can see the highest dps for every viable build here: https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/
---
But these numbers are just available with all buffs and a perfect rotation.
---
So remember, that even a Reaper with "low" benchmark DPS can out DPS any other class if they do a not perfect rotation.
---
Overall the best survivability and DPS has a guard or a necro. They are both easy to play and have a lot of survivability.
---
Especially  Necro (Reaper as my favorite) is great for open world, cause he gives himself all the buffs he needs (might+quickness). He has a shroud (or barrier as scourge) that makes him nearly unkillable in open world.
---
Guard is also good, cause he has lots of Options to block and a great Heal as a Dragonhunter.
---
I mean they dont mind triple dipping as seen with templates
---
Casual means 'relaxed'.  And that can mean many different things. 
---
It can be spending less time on it, focus less on learning its intricacies, spend less money on it, concentrate less when playing it and thus having slower reaction times...
---
you can convert gold to gems, but yeah, most of the good stuff is locked behind the gem store.
---
Technically yes but practically not really.
---
First of all, putting on new skins in gw2 cost some account bound hard to get(through login reward or time gated) items called transmutation chargers. For every time every piece you want to change the look, you need to consume one. The most common way of obtaining such charger is from black lion store or chest, which cost gems. Definitely not as easy as some small amount of gold as it is in wow to change skins.
---
Secondly, in terms of good looking armors... quite opposite to wow where lots of low level raids/dungeons drop nice looking armors/weapons, while ur leveling up your armor is going to look pretty bad unless you buy an outfit from gemstore. They are just very few dungeons (8 only) that you can do while leveling up and some skins are arguably kinda nice looking but definitely not the same level as what they sell on gemstore... When ur level 80, dungeons are known as fractals, which rarely drops some nice looking weapons, and I can’t think of a particularly good looking armor that it drops.. after all it’s only 20ish scales dungeons repeated in 100 levels of difficulties so... not much... I don’t even know the point of doing them after a while lol... 
---
But yeah otherwise the most common way of collecting good (looking) stuff is through collection in gw2. You will be given a list of items to get, usually cost quite a lot of gold (can be farmed or bought with gems). The most notable collection being the legendary weapon collections, which cost around 1500 gold each for the old ones and 2000+ gold for newer ones... (farming gold in game is like 20 gold per hour if u go on a efficient mindless grind). So yes with around half a year effort you might get a cool looking weapon, umm, mostly for the skin. So yes it is achieve-able. Lots of grind tho, or, you know it, buy gems..
---
There are also some other quite good looking ‘black lion chest’ skins that people get from chests and put on trading post for sale. Usually like 20-100 gold a weapon. Some armor pieces are obtainable through specific token grind or collections but usually take a while and are in general less attractive then some gem store outfit. But ppl do admire non-gemstore fashions so not buying gemstore skins might be a more morally welcomed way among the players I guess? Achievement reward skins are very limited in numbers but are kinda nice.
---
After all with no gear score and vertical progression at all in this game, fashionwar is the only end game ppl pursue. But I personally kinda feel it’s essentially pay to win... No mount skin and no glider skin can be gained through in game play at all, non, well maybe one glider but it’s 1000 gold too so it doesn’t really count. All the shinny mounts are bought with real life money, all of them.
---
So yeah, sorry if I ruined the game for you but that’s how I feel as a long term player who recently gave up hope on gw2 and started playing wow with a friend and actually enjoyed farming for skins not buying them... if u have more questions about gw2 I’ll answer here and clarify if anything being not clear enough
---
I always find it amazing how hard people can complain about the prices, yet no one seems to shed a thought on how Anet is supposed to operate and keep running and adding to a game without a steady revenue stream.
---
Yeah, I also find the templates (too) expensive, but at the same time we all know how many players would be willing to shell out a steady 20$ each month for a paid subscription. There's a reason nearly every new game goes free to play or buy to play in this field.
---
There was going to have to be a price we all have to pay for us...
---
Meanwhile there’s me, that odd one out from SEA :(
---
Damn I eeallllllly like the concept picture for bifrost
---
I like Rabid Mirage with Staff. Nice, cheap and fun.
---
Honestly, I'm quite surprised that we haven't had any new dungeon additions since I quit almost six years ago. A lot of the game has gone completely untouched in that regard. It is a deep shame. 
---
GW2 is beautiful, all of the areas are wonderfully designed and it has so much potential.
---
Yep, let's not use any metrics to measure a games health.  Or, better yet, let's only use metrics that agree with my personal opinion and bias on the subject and discount everything that doesn't agree with it.  Makes sense
---
Guild Wars really just had a great way of setting the game atmosphere with the combination of their worldbuilding, map/asset design, and the music.
---
Factions was a particular favorite of mine on that front. Just wandering the mess that was Kaineng City, and hearing the ambient theme there evoked a sense that this was once a great place, but has since fallen far, but perhaps there is hope.
---
&gt;most of the good stuff is locked behind the gem store
---
That's laughable
---
How old is "older" players.  To get people that aren't "savvy" with online platforms you need to go into the late 40s or 50s.  That demographic doesn't play a lot of games as it is.  I honestly don't believe GW2 has a significant number of people in their late 40s and older playing.
---
I got a stock photo from the help of the internet, there are thousands of stock poses you can get for free ane buy so i did that. I sent the artist images of the bifrost, the armor, the stock photo pose and the photos of the Kpop girl.
---
light requiem armor with tempest shoulder skin gets my vote but like everyone else said it's all subjective so I'd check the bank for skins and put something together on your own.
---
if you ever wonder where something comes from remember you can always type /wiki nameofitem (nameofitem obviously being what you want to look up) and it'll automatically redirect you to the GW2wiki.
---
LUL, I made about 15 in my time in GW2.  They are so casual it isn't even funny.  They are just glorified gold sinks.  To get one just swipe your credit card and do gems-&gt;gold or do some of the open world farms and you'll get one, not really hard.  Time consuming?  Maybe but definitely casual.  It's not like you need to clear raids or get rank 2k in WvW to get them, you can get them by pressing 1 and running in circles.
---
The achievements for the first 4 gen2 legendaries require some effort but the collections are just more tedium and can be done casually.
---
Well build templates drama is already gone for the most part, halloween is over aswell (which didnt bring much to the table) and prologue was quite a while ago.
---
So there isnt rly much of interest as of now to post on reddit.
---
What you need to know is that the game is dead. Hope I saved you some time, your welcome.
---
In what way?
---
It's nowhere near meta to have scourges as healers. It's a great pug carry but not as efficient in an experienced group. 
---
And on the claim that 
---
&gt; Every other class flatlines at the slightest resistance 
---
Is just wrong.
---
I've commanded a fair share of HP trains in Tangled Depths. While I do like the map, I totally understand how frustrating it can be. The best part is people that join just to help even if they already have those HP. Side note, why were you lurking on 4-year-old posts? 
---
Also, HoT&gt;PoF, always. The only memorable stuff we got from PoF was mounts and, while they're amazingly well done, that's not enough for PoF as a whole to be great.
---
No it isn't.  The number of subscribers is virtually meaningless.  Let's look at Super Mario.  There's probably billions of people who have ever played that game but very few that play that game now.  Would you say that game is active because a billion people played it?  No, you wouldn't.  The 200k+ subscribers this reddit has is similar.  I guarantee you most of those 200k never come back and just clicked sub when they were playing and didn't bother to unsub.
---
Also, MMOs look at active subscribers to judge player count NOT number of copies sold or whatnot because those numbers are meaningless.
---
People will always need Hero Points
---
Off.
---
I've been doing a lot of stuff in HoT recently for achievements and I wanted to go back and experience the launch threads again. I stumbled upon that comment on the thread for Dulfy's VB HP guide
---
I never got used to playing DH, but I need to try it out some more. I mostly play core guard.
---
Welcome back agent, it has been a while! Did you remember to bring the apple cider?

I usually set it LOW at least because OFF makes all cutscene scripts blurred.
---
I find em all the time, but honestly, I have way more fun stumbling into organic groups in VB+AB plus the first 2-3 PoF maps.  It's more satisfying to do them in small groups of 3-5 or 5-8 in my opinion.  Still, I think it's great that trains continue so that new players can get to try out their elite specs w/o much struggle.
---
Hello everyone!  I've come back to Gw2 after almost seven years of the game being live. Of course, I've checked in every now and then - messing around with the specializations from HoT and the mounts from PoF. Outside of that, checking cosmetics, remaking characters, and exploring on the 80's I do have kind of mindlessly. Only being mastery 17, it felt weird to open the seventh year birthday gift.
---
I'd really like to get more involved in the community and gameplay again since the MMO market seems so stale these days, and I just can't survive without mobile combat. Any advice on where to begin again would be much appreciated!
---
when the artist asks not to repost their art but you do it anyways...
---
Its not that bad, you really only need 2-3 people max to do HPs, some classes can solo them too.
---
And there are like 3-5 nasty HPs in total, you should be able to solo the others.
---
Right now the easiest solution is to just get all the ones that you can do by yourself (communes, veterans), and then buy the rest with wvw tokens.
---
oh wow, lishtenbird is karma farming again with unfunny jokes
---
what else is new
---
i lov enecro but this is just wrong, necro is probably the best class for open world, yes, but in raids necro can be meta for maybe 3 bosses and the rest it's either mediocre or complete shite compared to other classes - probably the most all rounded class in the game is guard but then specific to gamemodes others can be better.
---
Being good at a class is SO much more than being able to survive on it.
---
imagine wanting to return to a dead game lol
---
I found this poll on the forums.
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/21015/how-old-are-you-take-2
---
For the record, I am almost 50 myself.
---
Yeah I think that is what throws me off is the virtue differences. I am very much playing my virtues a lot as a core guardian that the changes to how they worked in the DH really through me off.
---
Yep, I love that Zeal/Radiance/Virtues combo for my core guard for sure.
---
"4y"
---
I feel old.
---
Kill ppl in wvw and you won't have to do hps. Unlock them from the merchant.
---
Oh look, another "xD Programmers are NEERRRRDS who have no social skills and fail as people!! xDDD" post. Grow up, dude.
---
Dahyun's concept look for their next comeback? I'm in!
---
Instead, we got a magic dildo.
---
Nice butt cape!
---
I mean if you are not going to play high fractals and raids with your core guard then it doesn't really matter. And even then, afaik in some situations core guard is actually better than DH (though it is harder to play).
---
Core was also very strong in PvP and WvW roaming before Righteous Instinct nerf. Though it should still be okay at those gamemodes.
---
That isn't much different, right not at 19 CET we have:
---
GW2 ~1500  
---
ffxiv ~5100  
---
wow ~6100  
---
lol ~31000  
---
gta ~3000  
---
bdo ~1800  
---
NW ~400  
---
eso ~1600
---
There are hp trains quite often and a lot of people love PvE. Plus it's sometimes hard to get on a zerg on some servers too.
---
Plus Chrono is a ton of fun too so you can't go wrong
---
That's fucking great. Literally just made a FB because I saw that were going to nerf the shit out of Holosmith, my only other character.
---
As a new player, what profession should I play that isn't going to get destroyed in the next few months.
---
In the past I just quit playing an MMO when my class gets nerfed. It kills all momentum I have for the game. I'm trying to avoid that.
---
My Memory of OG WvW Was zergs running around capturing things just because people needed them for map completion. Made it more fun and populated imho, "Oh you need that tower's PoI? Lets go get em boys!"

---
The Meditations Core Guard build is super common in PvP and works really well in open-world stuff too. Due to its build, your entire skill bar is filled with Meditations, and by taking Monk's Focus (I think that's what it's called?) every Meditation skill heals you. Added on top of using Litany of Wrath which is a Meditation (and also gives 20% Crit chance) on a 20 sec cool down, you're doing big burst damage when you burst with reasonable sustain. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Granted, I haven't done fractals and raids because I'm a PvP mongoloid, but Meditation Core Guard is my favorite build to play. My \*only\* complaint about the build is that it's pretty squishy, but the amount of healing available kind of makes up for it.
---
Personally? Neither. 
---
However Mirage is a nice spec because it means you are playing mesmer. Mesmer has a great perk which I don't see many people talking about which is that if you get strong enough you can summon clones as your personal slaves. What I would be careful with is making a black mesmer, since it would mean you make black slaves which really isn't a good look on your end. 
---
Additionally I'd like to point you towards a GREAT holomancer build called Permasmith. Basically you can be in holoforge permanently with making use of dodge roll to remove heat. 
---
Reaper on the other hand is a great class if you are new to the game since it is borderline broken in solo content, it has everything you'd ever want and more. However if you want to be good at the game, it might not be the best spec as you may end up learning bad habits. 
---
Good luck in tyria
---
your guide to life
---
\-Jesper
---
I hope you didn't pay more than like 5 bucks for that. :/ almost nothing in this piece looks "hand made" if that is how you say it.  Unless the goal was to pay someone to put finished pieces together nicely. Then I guess it works.
---
But that still only shows that GW2's high is close to their low, not that it's the same size.
---
Was looking at the art before reading the title and instantly thought how much it looked like Dahyun. Mad props to the artist.
---
&gt;  in WvW and particularly in roaming there are scenarios where it does outclass scepter for kiting ONLY because of its range advantage, albeit really just for plinking with the auto-attack as all of its strongest hits require either your opponent or you stay still. 
---
I definitely don't use mine for roaming looking for duels. But when you're solo and just hanging around zerg vs zerg fights for fun, LB dh *hurts* when the blobs merge and you're allowed to free fire from a distance where getting focused is unlikely.
---
Niche, and kind of playing like a bitch, but fun.
---
Bit hard to say that with two datapoints.
---
I also remember feeling like I could EXPLORE in PoF, which felt great. The sand trails in the sky, the mini dungeons in the maps, etc all felt amazing to go through and soak in at first. They just didn't have much reason to revisit them.
---
I would probably play pve, fractals, and dungeons...if they have dungeons now I mean. Pvp is too much for me, I suck at it sooo bad that it doesn't matter.
---
Even if you do not need the hero points, you get a ton of rare unid gear bags and hot currencies from those.
---
i hear my mesmer in the background cheering for some slavery, hush
---
didnt actually see any permasmith guide after a quick search but i suppose one ll get the idea while playing it sooner or later.
---
might as well scrap the reaper, not really the idea to handicap myself in the long run while im not even that hyped about the style to begin with.
---
why neither tho? what are you running?
---
&gt; Scrapper: don't. (hard to kill buffy healer that will both protect and heal the group, also cleanses conditions like nobody) no offensive buffs, lesser heal, it's increased resistance is not needed on PvE, it's massive condi cleanse is rarely needed and no fights are so condition heavy that make it worthwhile.
---
 \*cough\* WvW \*cough\*
---
It's not like the post quality was any higher before the sub turned sour. There are only so many quaggan drawings one can sit though before deciding this sub isn't worth visiting. Can't blame either camps, there really is nothing worth discussing about the game at this stage.
---
wait. people have money for a tag?
---
Still doesn't solve the problem where the hero train takes the only map.
---
This is really neat, thank you!
---
The first months of WvW were wild because of too many weird bugs such as this one.
---
POF zones are truly awesome &lt;3
---
Apple tag is just as fine. And yes, hero trains are annoying if you try to do the meta at the same time. However, they happen to cooperate and help out as well!
---
Honestly, out of all the glowy monstrosities, that is the most tastefully done and well-styled glowing monstrosity I've ever seen
---
updoot for you
---
Poor scaling? You can do one lane with 5 people I wouldn't say that's poor scaling.
---
I personally thought the story was much more cohesive and immersive in PoF than HoT as well, and I tend to enjoy replaying those zones much more. I mostly use PoF elite specializations as well, just because they cater better almost universally to flavours I like.
---
Ha thanks! If it makes you feel any better (or worse), I plan on getting some Winter's Heart infusions when Wintersday rolls around.
---
the hero train didn't they completely ignored it.
---
But might get added to the statue pool down the line and you can key farm for statues
---
Nope. Any achievements related to them give other kind of rewards.
---
There's a series of collections related the first 4 mounts that would be perfect to give aversion of the base skin with 2 or 3 dye channels instead 1, but they instead unlock some measly snacks that can be bought to earn a bit of mastery daily.  
---
The griffon, warclaw, beetle and skyscale collections give the mounts themselves, instead letting you buy the mount, then do the collections to get one skin.
---
Please dont consider this reddit comunity as representtive of gw2 community. Iam pretty sure that gw2 has lowest percentage of its players on reddit. + i know that WoW has biggest number of people that dont play the game but are active on reddit
---
I'd like to have counters for how many people are in each lane.
---
That'll help people spread between the lanes evenly. 
---
That would also be useful in other similar events, like triple trouble or the ooze pits in grothmar.
---
I was like, "is that Dubu? Nah, it can't be." :)
---
No problem OP,  always happy to help. Look forward to having HP trains for a long time ahead.
---
People like to work for things ingame that have value. Not a price tag, value.
---
If everything can be bought for real money, why get good at the game? Some people need a motivation to play and improve, and if it's not there, they may stop playing altogether.
---
It's all about the hard wood, except when it's soft wood. As long as it isn't green wood though, we're good. ;)
---
Holo best class
---
They are so well done. I love every map and love exploring them even after 7 years. The story is on point for PoF too. Only thing I wish for story mode wise is hard mode and ability to receive a daily reward from them. That way achievement hunting would be a lot easier XD. LWS2 I'm talking about you for the most part XD.
---
That map completion tho.
---
I was on a full map.
---
you can earn gold in game and convert gold to gems to buy them therefore they are earn-able in game
---
I have to play on every meta to even get a chance for a drop.
---
What are some good Mesmer weapons? I'm using scepter and pistol right now with a more condition and shattering focused build. Are there any better weapon choices?

The Magician set would work pretty well:

---
I think it's fine. I like TD being a harder map and meta since everything else is getting dumbed down. But I see how the scaling would help with some issues.
---
&gt; because the amount of gold for the gem conversion is preposterous
---
If they offered mount skins in game it would probably still be about the same. You act as if a NPC was selling mount skins in-game they wouldn't be like 200g a pop, which they would be.
---
It is better the way it is now. In any semi organized TD you'll have people calling out the counts anyway. A counter in the lanes would be more likely to lead to miscounts due to the size of the area it covers. Nuhoch is probably most sensitive to minimum requirements and counting people who aren't anywhere near the starting nodules is probably a mistake.
---
The issue is, the mount skins aren't chest-only.  They've all been released outside the chest for 2000 gems along with their chest release...
---
At least there's "a-one" doing things for fun in a mmo. Hello, here I am. I play for fun. That the points of games, playing for fun.
---
Ok but the HoT story mastery nerfs came in like the first week, and all it did was remove itzel poison lore. Vabbi also was never master y locked.
---
&gt;Power Mirage with GS and Sword or scepter is really strong too
---
No it's not.
---
Stop giving newbies shitty advice.
---
Hey thank you for this!!
---
My lfg will probably be something like this : *♥Morpokk's Serpents' Ire ⏰xx:30♥* in the Vabbi's channel, around 4:00pm It's a simple copy-paste from the text file I used few months before.
---
&gt; Vabbi also was never master y locked.
---
Crossing the Desolation generally requires two things:
---
1. Long range leap on Raptor to cross an early bridge.
---
2. High float on Skimmer to cross a lake from the start to the "true" Desolation.
---
You can bypass these with good enough exploration, but those paths are extremely treacherous.
---
nope. not even a simple 4 colour pattern for the standard mount.
---
Go to metabattle to change your build. Get good. Then stand around one and start it with whoever shows up.
---
From what I’ve seen, she took time out to focus on her career back in May and just never came back. Can’t really blame her.
---
It mainly just makes me feel poor 😅 lol
---
&gt;Yes, it's a better system by and large. I'd much rather pay a set fee and feel rewarded for completing content, than having no sub and the best rewards locked in the cash shop.
---
Fair enough, and I'd love in-game rewards too, but I've spend *far* less in the 6 years I've been playing GW2 than what 6 years of subscription to FFXIV would cost me.
---
&gt;But, this isn't an either or situation, you can be successful without a predatory cash shop or a sub fee.
---
Do you have any examples?
---
maybe the fish is seasoned with bloodstone dust?
---
Gem store gem store gem store. Only.
---
for sure... they are only waiting to find a good way to put them on gemstore &gt;_&gt;
---
Nerfing something that already is incredibly trivialised
---
You're comparing apples to oranges here... Final Fantasy XIV is a subscription-based MMORPG, while Guild Wars 2 is buy to play. 
---
The business philosophy behind Guild Wars has been "no subscription fees" from the beginning, meaning that ArenaNet themselves are covering the expenses that subscription fees cover in other MMORPGs. So yes, they do need tactics like these to make money.
---
I know you mean well, but you shouldn't post these keys publicly. They can be a tool to gain access to someone's account with a bit of social engineering.
---
I agree. I remember when Gw2 launched and everyone was so excited for no sub fees and how Anet was "changing the industry".
---
I remember thinking, it's not like f2p games didn't exist, and it's almost never a good thing.
---
It's nice to not have to worry about subbing age unsubbing whenever I want to play again, but it's not that big of a deal.
---
don't worry it will be added as fast as build templates were added and everyone will complain about it after it is added
---
I would not expect them to. You could argue that the existing Elites are already "p2w" because they are expansion locked and are often straight upgrades over core, but you get more than the elite spec with your purchase. That said, if they said "here's one new elite spec for each class all bundled together for $10" I'd pay for it.
---
Of course that raises the question of how to get the hero points to unlock it. Not everyone has core tyria completed.
---
It would have to be done like the wait before Dragon's Stand. Small circles for player to stand it to be counted.
---
Damn, what a nice vibe from this character. The mix of colors from bifrost, the charactet and Kpop vibe is really nice.
---
[deleted]
---
Past interviews have indicated that the next wave of elite specs won't necessarily offer new weapons
---
I think we will get at least 1 more batch, but I don't think new weapons are on the table for all classes.
---
Seriously, it's all depend if they are gonna be creative about future added Elite Specialization. A lot of people have created really interesting possible Specialization over time and prove that it still interesting to push this way.
---
But if they go the easy way and just copy some already Specialization but on an others classes that will not go well for them.
---
Personnaly, I dont care how they add them but I would really like some Lore/Story around it. They can even do a quest line to unlock it in the LS maps and no more Hero points.
---
Mesmer and I think you are talking about Chronomancer now got some nerfs,yes but this doesnt mean it was that OP, in open world its really clunky to use because the lack of IP and also the phantasms have rather a long CD so chainkilling feels really slow. DH imo is more OP because of the way it does its things, for example DH has an on demand low CD 4k heal+condi cleanse+leap, has a 40 sec CD block wich is rather low compared to other open world builds, has not even one CC and if you take that Invuln elite it has an invuln too wich Chrono lost. The thing is chrono has all of these things, leap, block,CC but the difference is that you need to actually modify the build on Chrono to have all this, and by modding the build its not the raid/fractal build anymore, With what I said I just wanted to prove that something thats dominating in end-game content can run around in open wolrd without any modifications and still survive alone
---
Also, in open world mostly the burst damage is the thing that counts and guardian has one of the highest bursts as of now together with soulbeast. Chrono to have somewhat close burst would have to provide slow for itself(wich its not doing) and also the chrono burst is slow, so most of the mobs would die even before it would reach its top
---
The only dps that will survive is warrior. Why? In every fight there will always be banners. Most players who aren’t like LN, Sc, or try hards don’t care about warrior dps if it’s around 10k. Which means you don’t even have to try hard to learn rotations as long as you do your role and bring banners. 
---
Bs in gw2 is in every raid meta I think or atleast 90% of every raid fight. Bring banners , do your role, learn mechanics and your always wanted. Then later on bring your dps up and you will be a warrior god sooner then you think. 
---
There are other dps classes however warrior will always be in a raid comp until arenanet says we’re throwing away banners. Or until arenanet makes banners to like +10 damage and +10 precision which will most likely not happen. 
---
As far as other classes that have never left Meta comps, dh is another. Dh has been nerfed and buffed but it’s been in a good state ever since staff ele has been nerfed.
---
Well obviously story in video games or any media is subjective I hate star wars but other love it. Season 4 in terms of big moments is the best from fight Joko, to building our army (I would have preferred a reputation system to build up trust with some groups), to Caithe being changed, the first Kralkatorrik fight and Aurene dying, the first instance of episode 6 where we are flying on Aurene chasing Kralkatorrik then the final battle with Kralk. This season did something I don't think anyone expected it gave us an elder dragon fight in living world not an expansion.
---
no one said anything about replacing mounts with skins
---
I do TD meta every day and it never fails, but I understand it gets really bad in a map with an HP train. You just have to look in LFG and/or get to the map early. A good group with players that can actually do high DPS or provide boon support will have no trouble.
---
I’m pretty adamant about my views on mounts and I won’t bash people for liking them but anet screwed the pooch. 
---
They went out of their way to reduce waypoints to force mounts. Gate story behind mount mastery.  Mounts work in other games because they were part of the development but when asked about mounts, anet stayed there wouldn’t have mounts in gw2. They designed the game to work without mounts.  The wp system in place was good and the speed a character runs while ooc was perfect for vanilla. 
---
When the player based tanked they looked how to attract new players. Along comes mounts and all the forced integration. 
---
It was a mistake to cave and add them to the game. Anet has made plenty of mistake but that’s one of the biggest
---
I’m fully aware I’m in the minority here about mounts. 
---
As far as final fight goes there is nothing your character does that couldn’t have been done by John Doe. Pof was lackluster and any attempt to garner an emotional response was poorly done. 
---
The story wasn’t even 3 complete acts and the entire business during the uw stuff. Just no. 
---
Okay I’ll stop now. Lol
---
Me!
---
First time I see someone saying Expension could be "P2W". loll
---
Sure, they would be a "Power Creep" with the increase of Specialization because you add possibility and some classes became good at something that they arent before.
---
But same has you, if they release Specialization they will moneytize it one way or they other. Putting them in LS could be really interesting so you could get them free and that could add contain to the map. Player that wasnt playing would need to buy LS to get it just like Expension.
---
I'd like a code as well, please. Thank you. :)
---
For me it's season one. And u can't replay it....
---
What a shame
---
I'd like one please!
---
That's pretty weird.  Kinds goes against the flavor of elite specializations having new skills for 1-5.
---
Not saying wouldn't work, just not as impactful as the current ones if they all got 5 less skills.
---
I just added you on discord, thank you for doing this!   I'm Rufus#7304.
---
if you still have one... tnx.
---
Eu Player that would love one \o/
---
Can I have a code? Thank you!
---
Throw a few unique rewards around (Mount Skins for PoF, Glider Skins for Heart of Thorns, Novelties in Central Tyria, Infusions for every content).
---
Make them rare
---
Make them tradable
---
Make them craftable or put a barter option for them. 
---
Crafted or bartered items are Account bound and may require some effort getting them (for example, a "chak glider" takes 30 days of killing daily gerent or a lucky drop)
---
Like, there are so many ways to make playing maps more rewarding even if they generate less gold per hour. Could even use it to "heal" the economy a bit with certain items being absolutely worthless to begin with.
---
GW2 is niche, its not your typical MMO. so its geared more towards casual audience it seems and their marketing for it has always been lack luster.
---
Someone did the math, and they said its 300 dps loss or so.
---
Would love a code if you still have some!!
---
please and thank you.
---
I'll take one if there's any left
---
Heh, people say that it doesn't exist in EU and I am from Russia - not a single Anet's thing exists here :D
---
I’d love a code if you still have one!
---
A great read! Loads of interesting and fun stories :D
---
They could also repurpose old weapons. Still have 1-5 skills and still a completely new playstyle.
---
Please and thanks!
---
Hi Could I please have one? thanks!
---
I'm COMPLETELY unbiased but holo is always best ok mate
---
I would appreciate if I could get one or two. Thank you.
---
Would love a code! Unfortunately I don't use Twitter or Discord :(
---
Yeah those traps were cool :D
---
It'd be really nice if I can get one. Thanks a lot
---
Haha amazing!
---
Thank You 0w0 !!!!!!!!
---
well I don't have Twitter nor have I discord :( is it possible that you send me 2-3 over Reddit? (girlfriend, buddy I want to bring to the game and me)
---
that would be awesome :)
---
greetings from a German potato
---
Added in discord. Incognito#5943
---
Would like to get one, thank you kindly!
---
Would be easier to upload on dropbox or google drive, you should make sure those don't get to public eyes (as knowledge about used codes are one way how to identify as account owner, those should be as confident as possible)
---
Yeah I must have not understood the original comment because they have never added "New weapons" to the game ever.  I read it as each elite profession would not be getting a weapon new to the profession, as they all have in the past.  Example Scourge got to use great sword as a new weapon for that profession.   
---
You read it different so that makes me think: when was it ever on the table to add new weapons?  Was that actually in the talks at one time?  I have been playing since launch and never heard them speak of adding new weapons to the game.
---
Hey I’m from chile and Quiznos literally don’t exist here I would love to get a code so I can buy pof thanks
---
Ambushes are really fun actually :D. Glad you ended up liking it!

I'll take one thanks.

Your post wasn't a satire itself?
---
Hey there, shoot me if you got one! Thank you so much.
---
Wow. Thanks a lot for this giveaway. Would be nice if I could one (or if I can be greedy even a few so that I can give some to my guildmates) :)
---
You can also reach me over Discord Hertex#7083
---
Pick me!
---
Request sent on discord, but thank your time &lt;3
---
stfu shill
---
Art style reminds me of Ashe from FFXII.
---
I'd take one if there are some left, please. Thanks !
---
I picked you because you did what many others do, throwing out statements that everybody, vast majority, and so on which are just words you grab to make it sound better when you want to make a point. So since you kept on doing this i told you off yes or rather i pointed at a flaw in your statements and was hoping you would get what i said and instead focus on what is wrong and not what you feel is everybody thinks the same. But for some reason you don't, so i agree at this point it is pointless to go on.
---
Of course there can be more.
---
The game has 3 main focus for combat mechanics: Damage, Control and Support.
---
No elite specialization  focuses in just one of those alone. Because each one of those combat mechanic groups can be divided into other categories themselves:
---
* Damage
---
 * Power
---
 * Condition
---
 * Offensive buffs and other 'indirect' forms of added damage like summons.
---
* Control
---
 * Debuff
---
 * CC
---
 * Tanking and damage redirection
---
* Support
---
 * Healing
---
 * Utility buffs and effects
---
 * Defensive buffs
---
While each elite spec has at least 1 or 2 of those as their main focus, they can also make a manner of other builds.
---
It's kind of like Stat combinations. We have many, but there's still lots of possible combinations we don't have yet that we could have.
---
That is an amazing first memory haha!
---
Could I have a couple please? Me and my partner live nowhere near a Quiznos xD. And thank you for doing this!
---
Pure evil! I can imagine the horror when you get pulled off haha.
---
at least on Korea, you don't get those social demerits for playing online games.  Shit is strange over there.
---
Haha glad you enjoyed it :P
---
you can also Keyfarm. Got 2 Mountskins from random keys
---
I dunno I play GW2 like every other MMO that uses in game money to buy flashy stuff.
---
I get my gold, then use it to buy stuff. Sometimes it's stuff right on the market board, other times it's gems. No different to how I played FFXIV.
---
I think it would still be nice to have mount skins attached to a collection rather than just 100% gem based, but I don't see it being any different than having a mount vendor that only sells them with gold.
---
I'd like one if possible
---
Power: Sword (main), Sword (off), Focus, Greatsword, Pistol.
---
Condi: Scepter, Pistol, Torch, Axe (Mirage), Staff.
---
I'd suggest sticking to power if you're still leveling since you'll kill things faster. Focus and Greatsword have a decent amount of cleave damage for open world to hit multiple targets quickly. If you're just looking for better condition options scepter/torch + x/pistol (aka nothing + pistol so you can swap to it without needing another weapon) or axe/torch + x/pistol is meta for chrono (and base mesmer) and mirage respectively. Do you have access to the expansions to get the elite specs? Are you still in the process of leveling? I could give you some builds regardless but would need to know your limitations.
---
thanks already!
---
I have never failed that event and i did one just a few days ago were i jumped in just a few min before start used the lfg tool and got in to one and we did it with maybe 50 people all together and had 5.24 min left after kill.
---
Just put up a tag and ask others to do the same and make sure people spread out.
---
Oh man those times are always so fun! I have many times had similar friendly interactions with enemies and then the subsequent teaming up should the third faction attack us. I always remember having to be super careful when fighting so we don't hurt each other :D
---
i'd love one, thank you so much!
---
A true sea monster :P
---
if it works in eu as well i'll take one
---
Hey, if possible I'd like two codes =D
---
where is my free sandwich
---
nobody was killed?
---
I would like one! Thanks!
---
Nobody died at Stonewall?
---
and you were the first one to bend over and pick it up
---
The problem with rev hammer is it getting repeatedly nerfed in PvE due to WvW, when they could easily split the numbers. They're already split, just the PvE number should be changed. The most recent nerf actually hurt rev hammer in PvE more than it hurt it in WvW, a 22% PvE nerf vs 14% in WvW.
---
Now, rev hammer's damage output is significantly lower than a bearbeast camping longbow, and that's not okay.
---
I'm a few hours away from any Quiznos, so a code would be wonderful if you have more still! I sent a request on Discord, too, similar username as my flair.
---
wiki should have a page for total ass-pumps like logan too
---
Wiki is a player-maintained platform so go ahead, make a page!
---
Hey I would take one thanks in advanced.
---
At this point I'm not sure if you are only pretending not to see the problem with that kind of drop, or you grew up on mobile games.
---
Thanks to Idris and everyone else who has contributed to the article. :)
---
It's a good start with some fascinating lore added in too from various developer sources over the years (regarding Bobby Stein's comment on the ancient Seers being "genderless", Ree Soesbee's comment on the Pale Tree choosing the sylvari's sex, and Tom Abernathy's tweet on Jormag not identifying as any particular gender and how it's fine with you perceiving Jormag in whatever way best persuades you to want what Jormag wants).
---
The linked, old [GayGamer interview](https://web.archive.org/web/20160313120928/http://gaygamer.net/2011/10/interview_guild_war_2s_ree_soe.html) with Ree within the article is also worth checking out for anyone interested in the topic as it discusses Tyrian views on queer along with some other interesting reveals within regarding sylvari.
---
A shorter list may be straight characters.
---
I have the red and blue infusion on my weapon swap so I can cosplay as a police car.
---
Hey there. Would love a code! :)
---
I'd like one if you have any left! Thanks!
---
keys are pretty damn rare to get as random drops, so no, it's not "probably more common than any drop rate a mount skin would actually have" especially if hypothetical mount drops were treated like other games like WoW where it's similar drop rates to Ascended Raid Skins in GW2.  Obviously some of the hypothetical "in game mount drops" could be super rare like Chak Egg Sac, etc., but if they actually implemented a system like that I highly doubt all of them would be that rarity.  Also, you actually got really lucky to get both a key drop and then additionally get an uncommon mount skin drop out of the BLC from that same key.  That's pretty crazy low odds.
---
I've known a couple people who got fired for giving out promo codes from their fast food places, so I wish you the best and hope you don't get caught.
---
There's definitely demand for them. But can Anet balance them or have the will to make more? I would consider Elite specialisations as "expansion worthy content".
---
I'd rather have cosmetic fluff in the gem store than pay to win items.  Would it be cool to have a few mount skins in game accessible via playing?  Absolutely.  However, I like the current gw2 model of no sub fee, buy to own, and fluff-only cash shop items.  I've played pay to win games in the past, never again.
---
Still Codes available?
---
&gt; 1) why its so crazy expensive (800 gems vs 800 gems for character slot which gives you 100-160 bag spaces+some gear can be stored into equipment templates (...))
---
Name change contract allows you to keep your gear and progress, which new character slot can't do. This one thing already justifies the pricing.
---
&gt;  i am 100% sure it has crazy low sellings and price like 200-250gems will be "fair"
---
Show me your research, then we can talk about your pricing suggestion.
---
&gt; why its not included into BlackLionStattuete vendor?
---
My crazy bet is people are buying this stuff often, therefore Anet wants to keep its value (compared to makeover and hair kits, which only recently were removed from BLCs, due to market oversaturation)
---
But not that specific page.
---
Hello! If you have any left I will take one. Thanks!
---
edit: Discord is d0n0van2#9043 I sent you a request
---
could need a Code too :3
---
Why?
---
I guess "Why not?" is also a valid question, just curious.
---
Edit: Honestly thought there were more. And I forgot about that creepy Quaggan. :P And to be clear I'm part of the LGBT community and my question is not a hostile one, it is genuine and was answered.
---
Most hero trains will stop to do the meta with the rest of the map.  In the few instances they do not, I hop to another map and pop a tag to start a new instance.  I'm sick of seeing people bitch and moan about meta when they aren't willing to make an effort to command and make things happen on their own.  Communicate and organize.
---
Counterpoint: The mount system is probably one of the best mount systems I've ever played.
---
If you have any left is there any chance I could grab 3 of them? I have two brothers who play too and would like the bundle but they don't have a Discord or Twitter. I sent you a request on Discord as I have one though, RavenFeather#5246.
---
Damn dude, crying on this subreddit is like a full time job for you. Feel free to just quit the game if you actually feel that way, no one will miss you.
---
Don't bother her!

What about Rytlock and Logan bromance? :)

Definitely... there's a secret harem room
---
I'd love a code! 💖
---
Yes, that's why when asked "what about a collection that would cost 200g or close along with a few easy tasks" the common answer is "too much gold". I'm all in for the prestige part, just not prestige has in  "i talked to a bunch of NPCs and got this".
---
If it's going tto affect mount skin sales it should be meaningful hard content, also a good motivator for people to get into it (spoiler alert, after.some training almost all content becomes easy, except maybe raid cm)
---
Actually we just don't know for the majority of characters.
---
A code would be greatly appreciatted if you still have any left. Quiznos don't even exist in my country.
---
Would want the code  to get new mini, thanks
---
If there are any left, I'll take one :o

Its slower now but you can always fined a train! I ran a few myself but I didn't last long as a conductor XD

am i too late? can i get one.

wow pretty nice
---
It would just be nice to have any in game rewards other than crafting mats
---
there was one interview where they said they are still possible in "sagas" so even when we dont get expansion, we can stil get them. But I dont think it will be this saga, maybe next one in 2021
---
You are awesome for doing this.
---
Hi I’d like a code please
---
I'd like to have one if you still have. Thank you!

Consider me having commented!
---
The simple answer would be that during routine maintenance someone made a booboo, but if I just put on my tinfoil hat for a moment... 
---
The HoM is in the Far Shiverpeaks. The Ice Brood Saga takes place in the Far Shiverpeaks. 
---
What if, Whispers in the Dark is taking us back to the Eye of the North, and they had to do update work on the monument in anticipation?
---
I was hoping for a lighning infusion from the kralkatorik arc.
---
Fluid mobility, definite roles for mounts (although this can easily be a negative, as the niches become... niche [see: Springer]), easy transition into combat.
---
Compared to other MMO mounts I've played, they tend to be mobility only and the transition is awkward (WoW, Wildstar, etc) or the combat is too impactful or gimmicky (AoC, Flyff, etc).
---
Additionally, in a lot of games, the mounts tend to just be stat boosts (speed, generally, but sometimes other stats for no reason) where certain ones are objectively better.
---
In that final point, GW2 "falls short" as the niche-ness of each mount can be their drawback. You can't just pick a mount and use it for everything (I don't know about Skyscale and Warclaw, I haven't played since they were released). But you can have a general purpose mount as your favorite and switch between the rest as necessary.
---
I really liked all the GW1 story lines. Prophesies is still one of my all time faves.

I really liked this episode, it was super funny

Well yeah Aurene coming back so soon was a bit weird I think they saved themselves a bit having Aurene eat and consume Jokos magic.

There's magic that resurrects the dead and whatnot in Tyria, so sex-change magic (and not just illusion) wouldn't really be too out there.

If there are any left, I’d love one. ty

Well, if you get PRIME access then you’re getting a primed warframe, primary weapon, secondary weapon and melee weapon (all of which is ofcoursed prime) and usually mods and/or platinum to boot. Sure it’s not necessary to play it but you could buy your way thru rather easily if you wanted to. Pay2win doesn’t mean that you *have* to pay to win, but that you have an advantage in paying a small buck. I got 370p for 5$ the other day and I got some very high end mods for it.
---
It's similar with glyphs isn't it? Sure they are tradeable, but the only source is the gem store and BL chests.

There was magic that resurrects the dead. That's defunct now though. That said, there are magics that permanently transform the body, but such tends to be wielded by those of Elder Dragon and god level beings.

I'd like one if you still have one left, and thank you
---
If there are any left, I'd appreciate one! Thank you.

But this was also after the [42 min talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWOy0ryFfhc) about the impact of character death and how meaningful it was and then the 180 of "oh lol nvm". I mean I get that they wrote themselves into a corner but still don't like the way it was handled [(or the way they handled Aurene and Kralk in that episode at all)](#s "Spoliers"). Also might want to spoiler tag what you posted since this is a "just finished PoF" thread.

Neither could Caudecus.
---
Welp great job proving his point bud, couldn’t have done it better myself.
---
Thanks so much for doing this! Imagine being an Asian player like myself xd
---
Have you tried waiting for it to load completely?
---
Can we just hold the F up one second?

Is the image of Joko getting his mummy cheeks clapped stuck in anyone else's head too now?

&gt;Everyone else feels rather token and poorly conceived. I don't find Kasmeer and Marjory's relationship remotely convincing.
---
Their relationship felt convincing in Season 1, where they were often standing in the open world indirectly flirting with each other. After that though, their relationship has been so much non-existent that it's hard to view it as either convincing or unconvincing to me.
---
The lowering in quality for Marjory in general is probably due to the fact that she was originally slated to die at the end of Season 1, but this got changed because so many people enjoyed her character. Ironic, then, that this resulted in people disliking her character over time due to the poor representation of her as a detective.

I'll grab on if you have any left kind stranger.
---
Would like to grab one (if it works for eu) \^\^
---
Ugh I want those, the flame ones and the storm dagger.  I hate that I missed them all!

In part, it's an anti-griefing measure. If players are able to change their name freely or cheaply, it becomes harder for communities to identify bad apples, allowing trolls and griefers to continue with their negative behavior with no consequences for longer. Blocking players in chat only goes so far. Most MMOs that I've played that allow name changes (most don't) typically price them around $10. This price makes it inconvenient enough for average trolls to use it as a tactic.

&gt;but I think that in lieu of full on sex-change not existing in GW2 world, an illusion doing the same would be considered the equivalent thing.
---
Are you telling me [Total Makeover Kits](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Total_Makeover_Kit) were a lie all along?
---
Unless the terms of services on the label says I have to wait, I'm eating that chicken asap.
---
Good thing salmonella comes from salmon /s.
---
Solid argument. Go sue them.
---
you should feel lucky you guys still can buy mount skin ingame using gold. in China server, mount skin is only sold on a seperate webstore where you HAVE to spend real money in the meanwhile i have more than 20K gold sitting in my wallet doing nothing.  be grateful

---

---
Ping?
---
Could I get two for my family?  I already have one.
---
ok boomer
---
Dude's right though. We got a whole cluster of people whose sole reason for existing on this sub is to shit on the game at every opportunity. It's genuinely scary.
---
The Dredge commander isn't token? Really? Come on, most of them are simply given a cursory acknowledgement.
---
Hi, I would really love a code if you still have any left &lt;3
---
If it is not  to late, I would LOVE a code.
---
May I have two codes (GF and I)? It would be very kind of you!
---
Heyy if you still have any I would love one (and couple for guildies if you can spare) cheers!
---
The less ingame rewards and gemstore sales overlap, the less friction with the playerbase. Hard-won lesson from earlier experiments with the gemstore. It also mildens hesitancy to buy stuff if it's offered nowhere else. No split for the playerbase, where 'legit' players harass people who buy from the cash shop.
---
Yo! Returning player here, if you have some codes remaining I'd appreciate one ;)
---
&gt;Think about how much money you’ve lost because you pressed sell now thinking you’ll get fair pricing over the years, now add those up.
---
I think it was about 20 copper. It happened once. Then I started being patient.

mirage is unstopable in PVP
