Having a few stun breaks on the bar helps me while I roam. Are you getting locked down or stunned before your demise?
---
---
---
More mount related things i assume.
---
Probably map changing update
---
well, this a bit awkward, but I did p2 solo guide video just week ago for this ded content for my own amusement. I was on mesmer with harpy feathers, but I kinda tried to explain it based on skills rather than class (tho got kinda lazy at last run). It might give you some ideas. Or just throw me a pm and you can join our chill 2-man/3-man runs and I can explain stuff as we go (we run 500ap newbies through too so w/e goes).

---
Necro def hardest class to solo lupi, but doable. There's probably better explanations on lupi necro solo somewhere too. (: 
---
This is pretty much "wasted potential, the MMO".
---
Imagine if, in 2012, they decided to focus on expanding the game with new zones and dungeons, instead of the goddamn Living World with its pointless story instances.
---
This is one of the reasons why I hope they're working on GW3, using GW2's assets. Kinda like FFXIV reborn, remake the content and relaunch the game. Imagine GW2 having all the features we have today at launch, specially the wardrobe and collections. Speaking of collections, yet another huge disappointment, they could have done so much with them, but instead they wasted them for grocery lists. *Sigh.*
---
I'm kinda torn though. Even if they were working in GW3, they show zero signs of having learned the lesson, so they would probably make the same mistakes over and over again.
---
Thief is squishy, but it has tons of stealth, mobility,  and other forms of disengage for sticky situations. It also has tons of damage so things die pretty quickly. The elite skill that summons 3 allies is super strong for solo play to pull agro away from you.
---
Oh yeah, the rare armor sets. Never got to use them, because the drop rates were good enough, but they're worth considering too.
---
I think that would cause problems when you're in closed underwater areas, which there are plenty of.
---
I mean no matter how great the update is people will call it shit.
---
Thats how Mmo works
---
Raids have a story mode, they just don't have a normal or hard mode.
---
I can say for sure that fandom alwasu comeplain whever something happens.Anime, films or mmo dosnt matter people will alwaus comeplain
---
Where can i get this d912 thing? Can't seem to find it.
---
I honestly dont mind grinding for rng drops because you have a ton of dungeons and raids to choose from. 
---
I never had to look for DPS rotation or anything else, I juste usually play tank so... I knew my concentration cap, the boss mech, and the celerity and alicrity rotation. But the DPS wasn't matter until now
---
Leveling it GW2 is fairly quick though, even if you're not trying. If you are trying you can get to 80 absurdly fast. You'll also get plenty of things that can boost your leveling such as Tomes of Knowledge (gives you 1 level). Also you get a lvl 80 boost with each expansion.
---
Tnx for replies guys. After some consideration i chose to dust off my soulbeast, once i get gear to make him fractal worthy. Reasons for this choice (asides hating mesmers with passion) are:  
---
a) excellent uptime (maybe the best of all) of windows where your attack are unblockable. I forsee major pounding of subject 6 while rest has to wait.  
---
b) great quickness access - i despite how condi necro has no self quickness at all, while power reaper can enjoy some of that. Seems ranger does not have such issues - quickness for every build!  
---
c) the 0 damage taken defenses (signet of stone and friends). Another big factor - to pound away ignoring all the red circles. I like that:&gt;  
---
I sorry i didn't see that earlier. Yes i do and i still love this. :3 So far, 13 attempts... 12 success \o/
---
The people who join me listen carefully the advices and that makes the difference with a non-prepared squad/map. 
---
But, next week i'll be away for some hollidays stuffs. I'll be back the saturday after. I'll post something tomorow if i manage to find few minutes. :-)
---
season 4 ep 1 is a go to map for farming along silverwastes so i would go with it first as volatile magic is still relevant for current and future content, season 3 ep 3 is also good cuz of easy farmable currency that you can exchange for ascended accessories and aquabreather
---
I would but I kind of need geared and played the story already without so I'm looking at gear I'm eventually going to get them all for that reason
---
Everything character related.
---
Well, LWS 5 will take us on a new story arc that will probably lead into the next expansion. There was some talk a few days ago that there weren't  issues with Asian side that everyone assumed. I think that even if there was, they probably would've worked them out by now. 
---
I don't doubt it, but what interests me is which story path ANET will take to make that happen.
---
For a long time you could use Search and Rescue along with a well timed pet swap to get rezzed through the Agony.
---
In PvE Dragonhunter longbow doesn't do much damage compared to other weapons. On the other hand, a Condi Berserker with a longbow destroys everything in it's path.
---
That's very optimistic of you bot
---
Reaper isnt one of the strongest classes in fractals...
---
I am amazed to see you're this oblivious to one of the oldest animation cancels in the game.
---
Truly amazed.
---
Most of it comes down to knowing your rotation and basics of the class. Places like [snowcrows](https://snowcrows.com) for raids and [discretize](https://discretize.eu/) both have guides and videos there. Dungeons are older content that isn't being supported anymore so most of it is really easy with current gear and builds but there is some info on sites like [GW2dungeons](http://gw2dungeons.net) and youtube has a ton of older dungeon runs.
---
Acid Bomb has been like that since day one, people used to use it a lot back before Holosmith came along and offered better skill choices. Nobody ever got banned for swapping kits to cancel movement.
---
Interesting, hoped they fixed the rice balls being an issue. Guess not. 
---
Yeah but what about the dolphin path?
---
"asmr"
---
I think overall raids might need some reward buffs outside of ascended drops. Right now a single boss could take a normal group an hour if things aren't lucky and you'll average 4 gold, an exotic and a rare. 
---
Doesn't mean it isn't technically an exploit... pointless reply.
---
i never swapped trinkets stats
---
Strange they don't show on the bar
---
the selling point is the vigor imo. its a boon (more damage) you don't have access to. I wouldn't run it on rev tho because everything else isn't that good. might is irrelevant as you stack it so easily. swiftness isn't a problem either and I prefer 33% over 25% movement speed any day. durability is just to strong in comparison. would probably run leadership or surging over it as well. where the rune really shines is on guard. 
---
You may as well interpret it as 0-550.  It's an animation cancel; you can do similar things with most channeled abilities via weapon-stow.  It's an emergent player-gameplay behavior that ArenaNet likely didn't intend, but isn't going to change.  Arguing over it is a complete waste of time.  If you want to be angry and report or yell at people for emergent player-gameplay behavior then you're going to be very unhappy in the long run.  There are animation cancels/stows for after-casts in a lot of high-end PvE &amp; PvP builds.    
---
&gt; But I'm not trying to make a big deal out of what they're saying in interviews because I expect it to be untrue exactly because of the story they've been setting up for many years, so I really still don't understand what you're trying to say.
---
You stated *"If Aurene were to return the developers would be acting exactly like you say, deliberately misleading and vague as to not spoil the next episode."*
---
"Acting like Aurene won't return during interviews, then she does" is not a big deal, while "establishing for years that replacements (including Aurene) are needed, only to reveal that they are not" is a big deal.
---
&gt; She's also been somewhat of a daughter in the story and she carries massive emotional weight, too.
---
Honestly, I'd disagree. I mean, they tell us this is the case. But they haven't really shown it.
---
-shrug-
---
&gt; As for the retcon part, that wasn't what I was referring to. This was:
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; &gt; ".... and directly retconning previously established lore (in GW1, Lazarus revived without all his aspects"
---
The retcon here was that during [The Justiciar's End](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The_Justiciar%27s_End) quest in EotN, Lazarus was revived and in the flesh, despite not having his final aspect. In Season 3 Episodes 4-6, it's repeatedly proclaimed that Lazarus cannot revive without all five aspects, and that the method of revival is ultimately just bringing all five aspects together. This was a retcon done to partially justify and give a final-moment plot twist for "Lazarus is a fake".
---
&gt; &gt; "implication that we'll kill Kralkatorrik without a replacement because fukital. And that would be massive misleading of all lore ever since Hidden Arcana, really, but especially since Flashpoint."
---
&gt; The implication in the story is that we don't know what to do, just as the commander said in episode six at the end: "I don't know." I agree it would be "massively misleading" to kill Kralkatorrik without a replacement, which is why I think the replacement is coming back.
---
Didn't say implication in the story. I said implication from a dev comment. Specifically referring to [this comment here](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/815609/#Comment_815609). In a highly unusual situation of a dev responding to a lore forum post, and to a theory at that, the dev directly created the implication that the quoted theory/question is on the right track. That quoted theory being "we kill Kralkatorrik in the Mists to save the day without Aurene to replace him."
---
I love their idle animations, so adorable! From the raptors sitting down and shaking himself and nearly knocking you over, Skimmer tapping you on the shoulder with his tail, and the Bettle doing that cute dance.
---
IMO they should change the Skimmer like this: Same max speed no matter on what (water, ground, air), moving forward gradually increases your speed and turning reduces it again (sharper turns = more speed loss). Maybe also make the handling (turn speed) worse when faster.
---
This shouldn't change the mount all too much. When you are on water you already don't turn much. Instead of this binary “on water = fast“ you would have a more versatile mount.
---
Eh, more likely skewed from fans being the authors of the wording. The most canonical statement (off the top of my head) really comes from [the Orrian History Scrolls](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Orrian_History_Scrolls#The_Six) and [Cathedral of Silence](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Cathedral_of_Silence_%28story%29) mission. The Mists literally encompass all reality, so nothing can be "beyond the Mists" except in the metaphorical sense of meaning "from another world / universe". In the case of the gods and humans, it's "from another world".
---
For the second part, "deeper into the mists" would be like saying "going deeper into space". Which effectively just accounts to meaning "further away from Earth" (or in a science fiction setting, further away from civilized space); or in this case, "further away from Tyria". As they went from their realms that seem to border Tyria to further away in search of a new habitable world.
---
Well first of all, your title has a different question than your posit itself.
---
The title question is stupid since you demand a dev to come down here to tell you the obvious, what we can do just fine ourselves. 
---
And the post question is stupid because you're asking to change stuff **only** if what you consider an exploit is acceptable, and thus doesn't need any changing.
---
As a Redditor replied here, its about the bond i made with my characters.  
---
 As i explore the map and slowly leveling up, finishing hearts and events, getting to know the character ability and limitation, fighting and dying, i slowly formed a bond with the character. I care more about them, how they looks, what play-style fits them, etc. The hours 1 spent on the particular character make them unique to me.  
---
Compared to boosting one instantly, the bond is barely there. But maybe you're right that doing events and map completion can get me to like the character more. Got to give that a try with my Necro again.
---
Tbh I just want instabilities to scale to the people currently accepting the bounty.
---
If 5 people accepted the bounty, then there will be 1 instability.
---
Another 5 and another one is added for a max of two.
---
Each instability increases rewards so yu can't just bounty train with only the commander accepting the bounty but at least it will make small scale bounty hunts more managable.
---
It made it more playable but the map itself is terrible
---
Don't buy them individually. Buy the bundles from the gemstore. Season 4 doesn't have a bundle yet, but will once it's finished. Bundles charge you only for the episodes you have left to get, with an innate 20% off discount.
---
If you're not interested in story or achievements, there's not much need to buy Season 2 as unlike Season 3 and 4, the maps from Season 2 are open to all who have the core game.
---
For farming, Silverwastes and Istan (S4E1) are the ideal atm.
---
For gear, I'd get S3E1, 2, &amp; 3. Episode 1 gives easy stat-swapping, while Ep3 is the only one with ascended rebreather (should you desire such cheaply), and the combination gives you enough for a full set of ascended trinkets (2 rings, 2 accessories, and 1 amulet). Unless you're in desire of the PoF/S4 stats, in which case get Episode 2, since you have 3 and 5 already.
---
Bloodstone Fen doesn't have accessories, just ring and amulet.
---
Yes. Check here for instructions on how to use arc with it: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/amgtb4/d912pxy_alpha_096_adds_arcdps_support/eflv31l/
---
I mean, just look at all the recurring characters we've already had to watch die for our cause. Your mentor, countless characters from the beginnings of the personal story, Trahearne, Eir, Zojja and Logan were on the brink of death when we got to them, Taimi's on her last legs, and has already almost died by Joko. At this point, Aurene dying had no effect on me. I've been numbed to death for shock value.
---
TP flipping?
---
Just judging from history... if they do something other than mounts, it has to be visually significant so that it's monetizable.
---
They've played with wind tech and gravity throughout season 4. So I'd guess exosuits that let you modify physics.
---
As a WvW player i rather not get oneshot by PvE people, is why i quit WoW.
---
Warrior Longbow is a melee weapon, contrary to its appearance.
---
Tengu playable race! 
---
Developer integrity lol, mounts are just a way to make money and they have done very well at that.
---
I mean Gw2 rn has 2 expansions and core worth of max level content while WoW only has 1 xpack worth of it at the same time.
---
No.
---
Not at all. I think they're just saying they trust those guys too.
---
Dude, read the patch notes, it isnt
---
It is on par with FFXIV for sure at third place with OSRS being second and Eso being fourth.
---
At this point they'd have to do something spectacular to get me to buy GW3. Anet's issues start at the very top, 'the fish rots at the head'. Its notable how their decline clearly began when MOB was the sole founder left. He's simply not a good manager.
---
THIS\^\^\^. That was 100% my experience, hours and hours wasted with people who either refused to do mechanics or just facetanked everything. I would have given up if i didnt have the motivation of ad infinitum. Once I hit T4 it was all smooth sail from there. My advice is, build a support character. The extra survivability for the entire group goes a long way.
---
Actual homes that we can decorate. Its the 1 form of monetisation that anet has completely failed to capitalise on.
---
`/bug` it
---
I know this is late to the party, but one answer I didn't see: do the WvW dailies regularly. This has a few advantages:
---
1. It will help you get familiar with navigating the maps. You'll figure out where the spawns are, the routes to enemy camps, and the places you ***don't*** want to go because you'll attract the attention of an enemy zerg.
---
1. It will help you learn how to *read* the maps. The amount of information on the map can be overwhelming, but its useful. Trying to take a camp solo will quickly teach you the difference between a t0 camp and a t3 camp.
---
1. The dailies will teach you how to look at the map and figure out what other players are doing. If you need to take a tower for the daily, look at the 4 maps and try to figure out which enemy tower is the most ripe for the taking; once you travel there you'll probably find others of your team already working on it!
---
1. And most important: do as many of the dailies as you can and then *quit*. Go do something else. That will force you to stop doing WvW while you are frustrated and annoyed. That's what I did for a long time, until one day I realized that I liked WvW, and now its my preferred game mode. 
---
Finally:
---
With respect to your build, first focus on survivability. *Not dying* is way more useful, and way more fun, than being a glass cannon. 
---
Thank you for answering another one of my questions on this thread! :)
---
A question for the Solo Instance community.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
After all, what is soloable and what is not soloable among Fractals?
---
Deathly is awesome! You guys at qT keep this going! More speedclears!
---
Fun to play not to watch. PvP is sort of fun to watch but you can't spectate most games unless you have shoutcaster permissions so it's almost never streamed
---
Honestly I think Firebrand takes the cake right now. I know Chrono is going to be the popular answer but I think FB is far more versatile and is far more enjoyable in open world as a support\DPS hybrid than a boonbot Chrono build. 
---
Right now I'm running around open world with a Harriers \ Celestial FB which is exactly that hybrid. I'm just monkeying around with Radiance, Honor, FB. Permanent quickness, lots of aegis, stab, protection, healing, good personal DPS because of Radiance + permanent retal and fury from Save Yourselves + Feel my Wrath with pure of voice trait, easy might stacking with Empowering Might. It does essentially everything outside of alacrity. 
---
Is it optimal? Probably not, but who gives a shit? It's fun to play and it carries random pugs in anything you'll find in open world and probably dungeons too. 
---
Because skill animation isn’t an exploit. It’s a thing in pretty much every mmo ever. It’s right up there with weaving skills off of global cooldown. Exploits gain advantage over others. What advantage over other players is there, by not jumping backwards?
---
No in ESO each mount has different movement animations which make each mount feel different and somewhat like the animal or machine they are meant to be.  And I could say the OTT outfits and infusions in GW2 make it feel less immersive and less fantasy like.
---
You’re not forced to run dungeons over and over.
---
Dougie, your comment history suggests more trolling than the previous comment. Try again. 
---
It’s animation canceling, which is not an exploit. 
---
Hard to believe that ANet would actually put any resources into monitoring custom arenas. A custom arena would also eliminate the probability that it was triggered by a report.
---
If it's such low priority, is it really still an exploit? HMMM?
---
Volatile as well
---
I do like the legendary weapons in particular. Yes, there's some currency grinding, but the checklists for crafting the precursors feel really thematic. I'm a largely solo player who takes long breaks between returning to gw2, but I made Bolt for myself and I'm pretty proud of it :)
---
Positioning matters in WvW.
---
Tipp for dungeons: play the power chrino build from either snow crows or discretize there. Fights are too short for support chrono.
---
\#MountsinWvW
---
It is not as bad now but I still see it sometimes. 
---
WoW’s recent expansion that came out 3 months ago came with 8 dungeons and 18 raid bosses all ready. GW2’s last expansion added 2 “dungeons” and 6 raid bosses. I’d hardly call that an expansion’s worth of content.
---
I knew OSRS was a hit among the fans but I didn't realize the playerbase was that big.
---
That's true, but they could always make them unmountable areas like they have a few of above ground, like most jumping puzzles
---
Thx! 
---
Farmed bitterfrost
---
Didnt try Siren yet
---
Will check it out! ^^
---
I really waiting to see how this goes on a reset night, has it ever crashed the game or just texture glitch?
---
Thing is, WoW's new dungeons and bosses replaced the old ones while Gw2 just added to the pool of the ones available.
---
As a WvW/World PvP i also don't have to do hardcore PvE just to be able to play the gameplay i actually like, as right no PvP isn't viable for gearing and just drops random trashy dungeon gear. This makes the game literally unplayable for any PvP only/World PvP player.
---
most graphical glitches are fixed on my rig. the only ones left are buggy character portraits and the occasional "blank" objects, which are new objects that are still waiting for their shaders to be compiled.
---
the only major bug that i'm seeing (which is also preventing me from benchmarking), is that D912pxy will result in such a low GPU load on my rig, that my video card (RTX 2080 Ti) goes into low powered mode, resulting in crippled performance. this isn't seen at all with stock GW2, so it's definitely an issue with D912pxy.
---
I always run Tempest in WvW. But people kick me out of groups for not being Weaver.
---
What's the problem
---
In my experience, the springer has an exceptionally fat head.
---
That is all.
---
I would wait till the contracts go on sale.  You will still have a chance to get a roller beetle skin, but you'll save some gems.
---
Make sure that the pack you are buying contracts from has roller beetle skins. Older packs do not have them.
---
I can see where the OP is coming from.  From a writing perspective, death should always have meaning.  Death is but one of the ways we as humans measure the value of life.  
---
The GW2 writers appear to favour plot twists that have a lot of shock value to them.  Most of the recent Living Story episodes have ended with a dramatic plot of some sorts.  In fact, the last couple of Living Story episodes have ended with a character dying.  
---
I suspect the GW2 writers are going to do a messiah type storyline where Aurene comes back from the dead.  There will probably be a dramatic plot twist at the end of the next Living Story episode where Aurene comes back from the dead or something like that.  
---
To be completely honest, I reckon there has been an over-reliance of plot twists as of late.  I feel like plot twists are currently is driving the storyline, not the characters.  It is a very messy style of writing that you normally see in soap operas.  Personally I want to see more character driven storylines which is what happened in GW1.  
---
They made mining picks universal so that all (should) gather 4 times. But, they never made the universal update for the other two gathering tools. Some axes gather 4x, but not all. Some sickles gather all resources in one attempt, but not all.
---
WoW adds new PvP maps? 
---
I think you can get gear just by doing PvP without touching PvE, but I’m not 100% on that
---
RuneScape
---
while I agree with you generally speaking, I'm actually running a power based firebrand for roaming and having a lot of fun surprising people who think i'm using a support build :D
---
Doing 35k bursts with a guardian from range is a lot of fun.
---
When was the last time you played WoW, cause there is a bit of normalization with gear in PvP now.
---
I was talking about PvE content though. 
---
I keep getting this error [https://imgur.com/a/B9trU8p](https://imgur.com/a/B9trU8p) in cut scenes, really annoying. any suggestions?
---
someday I would like to see mesmers use the longbow
---
With some strategic salvaging, bag opening, and mystic-forging you can get all 25 sigils cheaper than 5g/each. However, it would require a couple of hours for research and maybe an hour for crafting. The resulting savings might not be enough, though (I expect at least 20-25% cheaper than buy order price), especially if you farm Istan or play on TP.
---
You can still use warrior LB from afar. You just won't be optimal in terms of DPS, but if you're just doing open world stuff, does it really matter? And when you're doing things like fractals/raids you generally want to stack anyway for heals/boons so it doesn't matter in that instance either.
---
I'll watch the video when I get back from work!
---
I'm on EU so that would be cool :) I was in a group in Arah yesterday and we did all paths, but it was so speedy I missed the last boss in the first 3 paths.. maybe even more bosses, idk. My tag is Scifit.8412.
---
Yeah, lupi is a bastard, but I really like my necromancer. I keep trying alts, but within less than an hour and I'm back on necro.
---
I love the animations and how your character reacts to them.
---
I think it was indeed supposed to be fixed already but a friend just got the same bug one day ago.
---
They removed the normalization witb BFA from what i heard.
---
That still doesn't solve the problem even if true as PvP still gives pure crap.
---
I played a lot in MoP and then Legion but Legion was also shit with this.
---
WoW's PvE content is grinding the same things over and over every week.
---
If you just want a general build for open world pve levelling. I would actually suggest you go dagger/dagger(or dagger/warhorn) and staff and the glassiest stats you can find. Scepter is great in certain types of scenarios in higher level play, but it is painfully slow to use in the low levels. Dagger/dagger generates a lot of shroud so you can use shroud regularly and spamming those dagger attacks is both fun and effective.
---
Griffon and Jackal 99% of the time, here.  Jackal has great handling, and you'll never fall to your death; just teleport at the last minute.
---
client use is quite low except for those patches. 18GB should be more than enough for a month, assuming you're playing only a couple hours each day.
---
it's a recent bug, we just have to wait for Anet to deal with it at this point, sorry
---
the endless trolling and whining that is the WvW Team Chat can turn many people off. Almost everyone on my blocklist are people I blocked after encountering them in WvW.
---
that's because the aim is different. Raids are something to clear regularly(I believe weekly?) and then move on and do other stuff. WvW rewards are meant to be giving passive rewards for people who choose WvW as their primary game mode. They weren't designed as something to be cleared once and then you never do again forever.
---
Goddamn it I wanted to be the cool kid for once.  I recorded myself last night doing the same thing (with bond of vigor) and was going to upload it until I realized I should probably look first to see if anyone else had done it, and surprise, you already did it better.  Curses XD
---
I think you may misjudge how the leveling in GuildWars2 works. You get barely any xp for killing mobs. You get tons of xp for anything else  tho, exploring the world, doing events, doing heart quests, crafting, jumping puzzles, you even get exp based on your level if you do lower level zones.   
---
So just run around and enjoy the world, level will come on its own
---
But then it wouldn't be a skimmer. It'd just be.. I dunno, a swimmer
---
It actually is? 
---
as much as I would personally love for endlessly repeatable and well rewarding diamond chest, on a busy week irl I finish diamond maybe twice or three times. On weeks where I am on holiday, I can finish diamond maybe 15 times. The first diamond finish is usually before the weekend is over. Endlessly repetable diamond chest would give way too many benefits to people like me. Not that I would fight against a change like that since I'm one of the people who would benefit greatly from it :P 
---
Quaggan mount

... As a melee glaive.

I’d buy that infusion

There are training guilds which explain the mechanics.

Does anyone have a good guide on how to get ARCDPS and D912 working at the same time?  I know it's possible but I'm an idiot when it comes to this stuff and need my hand held. 
---
&gt; I don't want the armour set handed to me on a silver platter, but I do want to be able to achieve it within a year of consistent playtime. 
---
by your own numbers, this is perfectly achievable:  
---
&gt; you get like 5 ranks an hour if you are lucky and using a bunch of boosters 
---
1 hour = 5 ranks
---
1 year = 365 days
---
if you play 1 hour each day, you get 365 \* 5 =  1825 ranks
---
Looks achievable with consistent play time to me.
---
1 rank per day means you log in and spend 90% of your time afk in spawn.
---
It's exactly why I started this type of content on my channel. They deserve more views and more visibility !
---
Yeah, well.. then they could've chosen to keep Eir alive then. Because apparently her death didn't strike much of a chord with you.
---
What I'm trying to say is: you're arguing that the Commander isn't aware of the risks they take or that they feel they can't lose or die. I disagree.
---
I'm sorry that your life is obviously so very, very hard for you. You really have it rough.

Draconis Mons is excellent for this. 
---
I'm a long time player, and huge fan, of WoW, but after I've gotten the raptor in GW2, I realized how far off the mark Blizzard is, with mounts.  
---
I was so struck by the quality of the raptor's animation, that I used it as one of the main selling points to push my brother into giving GW2 a try!  
---
I was actually considering making a post like this myself, but then I ended up in hospital and forgot about it...
---
Try discord 
---
Fair enough, I'm guessing you have one of those MMO mice? I'd probably prefer buttons too if I had one of those mice.
---
When I started out, I thought I would just get to rank 2k and be done forever. But now I stay because I get to fight [alongside awesome and inspiring people](https://i.imgur.com/1jMa5Oa.jpg). The current goal is the Ultimate Dominator title and I'm only 33% there, so many many years to grind for :)
---
Watch a YouTube video or read a guide. Duffy has a bunch
---
A love made flesh.
---
They're safe. There's no unfair strategic advantage in knowing your dps, enhancing graphic performance etc. 
---
ok
---
tempest isn't meta, it's worse than firebrand in every way
---
Clowns to the left of me,

Jokers to the right, here I am,

Stuck in the middle with you
---
Quickness Firebrand is my preference. Can build it for Power (Berserkers stats with Runes of the Flame Legion) or Condi (Vipers stats with Runes of the Firebrand). There are other variant builds as well. Each of the Tomes provides different forms of support, you can give a bunch of boons to your party, and you still do excellent damage by yourself. With access to a wide variety of utility skills, the Firebrand is the swiss army knife of classes. I highly recommend it for both solo and group play.
---
Really!? I must have miss this information, did he give any reasons why :/ ?

As absolutely disgusting mirage is, I had 3 games yesterday with triple mesmer comp on opposing team - and I won all 3 of them. When teams have more than 2 mirages they kind of shoot themselves in the foot because they will be lacking in other areas. Having 3 mirages means you have little down cleave, making for easy revives, the team fight is pretty weak in comparison to FB/Scourge combos etc etc
---
Regardless, screw mirage and all that visual aids.
---
Don't think so. The Hook only gets rid of the (imo) really ugly bloom, while for example leaving the color filter intact. 
---
WoW is struggling because people finally realised how hollow the grind is. Or rather, how much it's meant to squeeze out all the sub months from you. It was always that way, people just see it clearly now and they didn't do proper job with smokes and mirrors with current expansion.
---
Grind also isn't really what people have time to do anymore. We ain't teenagers with out-of-whack-sleep and ability to raid/farm 4+ hours every day.
---
I'm surprised gw2 still goes on and has no issues of players to do metas and some events/maps. Also bit scared since MMOs have been withering for long time. And GW2 doesn't have massive Chinese presence.
---
I do too. I think that's kind of normal and have come to accept it. I mean, the processing still works and that's what counts to me.
---
... yes it's true but raids actually saves the game...
---
Best content ever added to the game. It's hard enough but not uber easy
---
Having a routine for video gaming is antithetical to my enjoyment of video games.  Makes them feel like work.
---
Already over saturated topic and comments
---
To reiterate what everyone else says: find a group to play with, or join your server community, or resign yourself to the fact that you'll just be playing alone. Some people like to play that assassin/duelist style with no care in the world of what the game mode actually involves. 
---
If you want to play the mode rather than treat it like a sandbox PvP arena, then you need to get involved in a community.
---
&gt;As for the red error I would move the MagicBloom.fx file.
---
Move or delete?
---
Anyway, do you happen to know how one would start tweaking the stuff like the FilmicPass.fx? I couldn't find a template for what you need to type in the .ini 
---
It performs best at melee but that’s true of most weapons, especially in group content. It still is fine at range, particularly with the berserker elite spec. However it doesn’t quite fit the standard archer stereotype between the plate armour, and the damage coming from setting the arrows on fire rather than firing them especially fast or with incredible accuracy. Still you might find it delivers what you want.
---
There're no meaningful rewards in gw2. There never have been. Anything under ascended is basically mats and even ascended gear stops being useful after your 3rd to 4th set. Legendary weapons and armour are decent but nothing I'd do anything for. The only reward I want in this game are fractal relics for the fractal god title that is only 200 days away now. The only reason I play gw2 is fun. Raids, fractal cms, dungeon solos, long wvw sieges or big zerg fights sometimes even PvP, because the rewards don't matter. I too hope that someday I can play another mmo besides gw2 with some of the old gear grinds, raid progression and some of the unbalanced, badly implemented and sometimes just stupid goodness that were old school mmos. But until then I will just log into gw2 everyday and do what ever I feel like that day.
---
Not to me. Not when the content is fun. 
---
Fractals -&gt; Raids -&gt; Dailies, plus Istan stuff and HoT metas when they're up.  
---
All things I enjoy and take up basically all my time online. Sometimes I'll switch it up and work on achieves or go to guild events, but most days that's what I do. 
---
God griffons are the worst. I just end up staring at them while they do their stupid evade flounce and wait until I can hit them. Boring! 
---
H-How could you compare these developers? I mean, even IF star citizien releases one day it will have been the biggest scam in gaming history. It's been one broken promise after another, a lot of money spent on Chris Roberts family, instead of the game and just in general a giant shithole of nepotism and roughly 80% of all news regarding the games progress in the last 4 years have been controversies about the business practice and ethics of CIG. 
---
Have a link to the build ? :D
---
RuneScape is the closest game to the classic MMO experience, in my view. Even MapleStory isn't terrible.
---
I mean, the massive amount of developer transparency helps from what I've seen.
---
All of those points are pretty much wrong. The 1st one being the most stupid one - there won't be any more expansions and no more elite specs. Sadly.
---
&gt; Are you talking about current situation of red border?
---
Current situation? Desert bl is a permanent fuckup.
---
You can also still jump / glitch your way into ogrewatch ever since they reworked it. But at least it takes more effort than simply gliding in with a full zerg. 
---
Please delete T3 sm. Just cap SM upgrades to T0 or T1. And don't add fucking mounts.
---
Thanks anet. 
---
&gt;Tempest healers are still pretty great imo, if you're getting kicked because they wanted a weaver, then don't follow them. Find some better people to follow.
---
I wish entitled players would actually do this. You know if you're convinced your ranger or tempest or fuck knows what is the bestest build ever, surely you can find some other group to run it with. 
---
If the group you're following doesn't want you on a certain spec you can adapt or find a different group. Don't sit there crying about how you'll personally mail anet because you were booted out of a squad. 
---
But since they're too busy ensuring there's never enough comms and groups anyways, that wont' happen either. 
---
There was no policy at this time about multiboxing in pvp/wvw were prohibited, the policies were updated on the 11th of january and the 23th of january, the tournaments happened way earlier then that.
---
I have proof of the GM teleporting me, I was aware i was being monitored after that teleportation. If you watch the video of the match you can see i look in the leaderboard if there is someone there, i thought i would see the GM.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oE2vEQZTFo&amp;t=1s this si the video of the meta i recorded after i was teleported, you can see me asking numerously for the GM to whisper me.
---
https://prnt.sc/miq3tb in this screenshot i took you can see the cave where i was teleported to, i type "bruh" on my accounts to show i am responsive. You can also see i hadnt even discovered this area yet on my right client. 
---
On the left client you can see where my characters originally were stationed, its on a mushroom elivated from ground with no enemies nearby.
---
It ranges from a complete change in how you play to a tiny addition in how you play.
---
gw2 was the perfect escape from RuneScape, but when my wrist is starting to feel bad, back to rs or Xbox just like op here might just need a few games to play that arnt gw2.  
---
I don't understand people defending this god awful instability, are you playing t2s where there's only one instability at a time or something? 
---
Condi Renegade with Short Bow? Or have you set your aim at Longbow exclusivly?
---
Not true. Grinding mobs is probably the quickest way to level, get 15% kill xp too. Not counting crafting, tomes or level boosts of course.
---
Go to least populated areas or zones and get those mobs that nobody kill. Usually neutral mobs are stacked with bonus xp but red mobs can have those too.
---
Do you have macro keys on your keyboard, or a 12-button MMO mouse or something? You can key your different mounts to be various arcane key combos and then put those on your macro keys/mouse buttons. Failing that, you can pick up Voice Attack, put your various mounts on the aforementioned arcane key combos, create commands in Voice Attack to trigger those combos, and summon your various mounts with voice commands. All of these approaches are legit and not bannable as cheating, since they're the same thing that the radial menu does.
---
Regarding Voice Attack specifically, there are only six (eventually to be seven) mounts so you should be able to get by with just using the free version that's limited to twenty commands (although it's pretty cheap to just buy it outright).
---
Teamspeak? You mean there are people who haven't migrated to Discord?
---
I interpret that as "this is how it is supposed to be." She saw it happen over and over, because dying's a pretty good idea right now. Kralkatorrik is chowing down on the fabric of reality, on the other side of the curtain - that's where she needs to be. If she was alive and well, Kralkatorrik would be mashing his stack of Teleport to Friends on his inventory tab, jumping out of the Mists, Branding anything in her path. She has so much love for the world, that she can no longer be a part of it. It's the same reasoning that the Five Gods reluctantly accepted as the kindest thing to do for Tyria. The choice that only an immortal can make, if you like. 
---
Think about it. She has family on the other side - Glint and Vlast. She has an army. And, we gained an important tactical advantage in the Auditorium - Aurene lost her life, but Kralkatorrik lost an eye. The omniscient, omnipresent, and nearly omnipotent Elder Dragon can now see half as well, and has no real need to make use of his omnipresence. He can portal to anywhere on Tyria, but in the Mists, he has to walk (judging by that dramatically slow Brandstorm as Blish was being a big damn hero, anyway.) And the Mists are really, really big. So basically, it's cool, we actually won, don't worry!
---
It's possible that your system environment might still be producing the bug, so if you continue to see it even though you've made completely sure to install the absolute newest version, it might be worth taking note of your system specs and filing a bug report on github.
---
Divinity original sin2. Fking awesome, turn based combat though.
---
Not really. It’s not the answer to water down the content so that it all becomes brain dead simple. What’s preferred is if they rethink rewards. There is a dilemma across all of PoF - once you have unlocked the mounts, and *maybe* the few weapon/armor skins, there’s little reason to hang out there. 
---
Which is a horrible shame, because the maps are really well designed, beautiful and interesting.
---
thats sales after tax, not profit, so you got to deduct 1g from that, if you bought them from vendor (unlikely at that volume) or the TP.
---
And considering that buy order prices for envelopes barely went below 1.4g at all during the festival, OP probably more or less broke even.
---
Floating carpet!
---
&gt; But i didnt abuse any rules, the policy i have been told by other GM's to follow explicitly states that multiboxing is allowed in custom arenas, if it werent allowed i sure as hell wouldnt do it.
---
Gaile just stated that you are allowed to log into multiple accounts while in custom arena, not that you are allowed to multibox there using 3rd party apps.
---
I would recommend you to check [MetaBattle](https://metabattle.com/wiki/MetaBattle_Wiki) for mesmer WvW builds.  
---
But answering your qeustion directly - power Mirage and Chronomancer differ mainly in survivability and mobility.  
---
Chronomancer can burst more times than Mirage (thx to [Continuum Split](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Continuum_Split)), has Grav Well for bigger burst (if you go for it in a roamer build) and has serious boost to phantasms.  
---
Mirage on the other hand has leaps, superspeed, shadowsteps, target breaking and can be extremely annoying - meta for Mirage gives him an endles wave of dodges.  
---
Both specs can one burst weaker targets, Chrono has more sustainable dps, while Mirage can disengage at any time and come back for another burst.  
---
Your choice, your style  :)
---
* Weapon skills _**are**_ tied to the profession, not the weapon.
---
* Traits and Utility skills change the gameplay a LOT
---
* Profession Mechanics change the gameplay a LOT
---
* Elite Specs bring a lot of new stuff to every class - New weapon(s), new utilty skills, new traits, new profession mechanics
---
* You _haven't seen anything **until you're level 80**_ in terms of profession gameplay options and variety
---
Leveling to L80 is basically the tutorial - try out other weapons and other traits and other skills. Also, until you're level 80,
---
* _**NEVER**_ **buy** or **craft** weapons, it's a huge waste of ressources as you'll constantly level up, and also discover different playstyles you may prefer. Only at L80 should you start investing time, money and ressources in your L80 gear.
---
* Again, test out all the traits, skills and weapons to discover your favorite playstyle and interesting synergies
---
I just think choosing between dodging a boss attack and birds is dumb. I think the mobs spawning after you dodge is a bad design. I don't mind slippery as much, but I do hate birds.
---
the "russian" circus performer in the personal story.
---
&gt; There was no policy at this time about multiboxing in pvp/wvw were prohibited, the policies were updated on the 11th of january and the 23th of january, the tournaments happened way earlier then that.
---
but there is a policy about match manipulation, even before this:
---
&gt; Engaging in PvP match manipulation, **disrupting a PvP match by not actively playing in good faith**, or any other form of PvP griefing, exploitation, or abuse
---
are you spamming F when the chests gets revealed? I always wait until I can see the yellow text of the chest to open it.
---
I'm sure Poobadoo would happily volunteer.......
---
Hm, I had no problems with your bounties at all in group, but there are at least two bounties that should be toned down: Silkears (the bunny) and Muckstalker (Skale in desolation). Those two bounties depend heavily on CC usage, in case of Muckstalker you need to have consistent DPS and defiance bar damage to kill him. And it gets even worse with certain unstable abilities.
---
For backpacks, definitely Ls3 ep 6. Siren's Landing is by far the easiest map to get the backpacks with hearts and Abadon's bet. Plus you can gather wood on the beach and it's the best spot for this in entire Tyria.
---
Yet i would run for the entire LS3, maps are far better than LS4 to my opinion and much more replayable.
---
iirc doesn't boon overload work like the Herald F2?
---
And I stand defending instability from nerfing it to oblivion. 
---
Anet is a shitty company.  They brag about Setting the standard for the industry, but all their technology is 10 years behind. 
---
Money is money. Gw2 is doing surprisingly fine in West, which is what im surprised about (they dont exactly pump out new gem-store items every 2nd week). They make enough money to keep shareholders happy. Hurray for us.
---
You don't get rice balls with that high an amount of MF
---
You might have heard that one already but have you and your friends tried raids? I play pretty much every content except WvW rather regularly but to me, raids are by far the most enjoyable content GW2 offers. Especially with a couple of friends. Beating the final boss of a raid wing gave me the exact feeling you described and no amount of daily fractals or HoT meta events could ever reach those heights. Wings 4 to 6 offer amazing final encounters and I cant even imagine what it feels like to achieve that with a group of friends after nights of training (my guild group died before W5 was released).
---
ah that makes sense
---
I gazed at his face too many times. Being done with him is all that would satisfy me now.
---
Except for the first few days, the price on the TP was around 1.4g (buy order) 1.41g (sell offers). You get more than that : 1.39s pure gold per enveloppe ("junk" items), to which you add food, runes, fireworks, backpacks, minis ...
---
Happened to me too, with the asura in the Level 20 sylvari story. 
---
Tybalt.
---
The gear question is true, however, you would be surprised if you tried to solo content how much build variation within a class there is. 
---
we already have one of those...kinda \^\^
---
No！
---
Absolutely no more raid dungeons. I don't want to spend hours "working" after my working. Raid dungeons need a lot of organizational costs and a long period of continuous time, which is  inappropriate in this era .
---
Dynamic events are the strength of Guild Wars 2 and the best way to adapt to fragmentation time. They should reinforce this point.
---
&gt;magnified their fuck-ups
---
That could have been a good thing on the long run. Not everything has to work perfectly the second it is started. Making GW2 relevant to a PvP focused player community would have been a huge boost to its overall appeal. Maybe anet would have had an excuse to put more effort into pvp balance but now we will never know i guess.
---
Won't happen.
---
Tides of time is the only one of these three skills that has no target limit, though.
---
I never thought an asura could look physically badass, but you managed it :D
---
No Surge of the Mists is definitely bugged and applies more CC than it should. 
---
If the bug is fixed Diviner Renegade will have a lot less utility I'm not sure if I like that.
---
I'm one of those people who actually likes a lot of the new instabilities. Even slippery slope.
---
But birds can piss off. Flux bomb was my least favourite instability in the past because there was no way you could control it. It just happened and forced you out of your rotation. Now I have to say that birds is my least favourite. At least flux bomb gave you adequate warning. Birds will come in out of nowhere to blind you during key parts of your rotation, make you take forever to get out of combat, and then proceed to screw up the target cap on things like mesmer focus 5.
---
Seriously? Well in runescape I can count the pixels.
---
&gt; No Surge of the Mists is definitely bugged and applies more CC than it should.
---
is that your personal opinion or was this stated by a dev?
---
It's 9 individual hits with a listed knockback on the tooltip, meanwhile ToT is one listed hit on tooltip with a note that it returns back to you (so two hits).
---
Literally anyone calling Surge of the Mists a bug is just salty chrono mains, it's incredibly intentional in comparison to something like ToT or Phoenix.
---
It was a nightmare in the past for chrono. It still is terrible. I've given up to optimize, because doing that every fucking patch for every game mode is dumb and just overcap.
---
Eureka and Hunts, basically any content where you can get more than 60 people attacking together dips my fps to 30-45 and in FFXIV's case my cpu's temps go up the roof (not reaching throttling tho)
---
Doesn't matter what mount you own, when you use a random contract, you unlock the skin. Once you'll get the mount you'll be able to change the skin.
---
Think it in this way: It's like recycling armors and unlock heavy armor skins while you don't have any warrior/guardian/revenant character on your account; you unlock the skins, you're just unable to use them until you made an heavy armored character \^\^
---
Okay look.. you get vigor.. if you start the fight! Its good because rev dont get vigor himself with this build. You get might and fury (6) too. You use the trait „you get 5 stacks of might if you give yourself fury“ so if you start the fight on shito (i normaly do that) you have 1 sec after entering the fight: 6+5+3 stacks might (cauz of the other trait on dev.) you start the fight with vigor + near 90% crit chance + 13 stacks might. After you switch to herald and precast your aspects you have 25 stacks might instant.  And if your swiftness not there anymore cauz someone riped it off you have 25% movement speed on top.  
---
And we're back to daily broken texture posts :'&gt;
---
You have obviously not tried the dx12 mod and experienced the performance gains yourself. As of right now I can't think of playing the game without this mod.
---
Changing the game engine to DX12 might take too long of a time and effort, but saying it wouldn't increase performance? Come on, they have LIED to our faces.
---
7. Run, run now when you are not still addicted in LA jumping.
---
Great answers from this person OP. I just want to add:
---
&gt;The closest thing to player housing is a guild hall and that isn't available unless you have the expansions. Even then you dump massive amounts of resources into it to  upgrade it or to decorate it, but at this point that is far far in your futures.
---
It's not just "far in the future"; it's kinda impractical. The guild halls are really designed around mid-to-large guilds, rather than small groups of players.
---
As a small guild, you get a "building" (called The Guild Initiative) that you can use, which comes with creating your guild, but the customisation of this building is very limited.
---
"Housing", as a concept, might be underwhelming if you've come from games like Wildstar. It's just not a huge focus of GW2, though some people really do get into the Guild Hall stuff I mentioned above.
---
I'd say that mirage has more sustainable dps thanks to the ambush auto attack.
---
From the wiki page on magic find:
---
&gt;According to player research: "It apparently takes 1000% Magic Find to double your chances of receiving a higher tier item. Not 100% as may be expected and implied by prior quotes on the subject. It also implies that at 1000% you should stop getting junk as drops."
---
i literally got zero rice balls when i opened with &gt;1000 MF.
---
Among them, raid is my least favorite. He needs to invest a lot of time and is very unfriendly to the fragmentation time players. The reason I like Guild Wars 2 is that their dynamic event system is well suited for fragmentation time players. I hope they can reinforce this rather than follow other games to develop raid.
---
'Random' is the key term here. 
---
I honestly can't say I enjoy instabilities as a whole, because of this randomness. I get that Anet wants instabs to add flavor and variety, but that just makes it difficult for players to actually learn how to do fractals. 
---
I think stuff like Birds would actually be fine *if* they were locked onto a certain fractal, and no other. Like say, on Cliffside it'd make sense, and add flavor to the fractal and it wouldn't be too much of a PitA. Same for all instabs. Give each fractal an unique, themed instability of its own, and it'd be much better.
---
it's not an issue, it's how magic find is supposed to work
---
I think the main issue for me isn't the dodging, your pot regen helps with that a bit so it's not too bad. The main issue are the birds swarming you after you dodge. 
---
If Birds were turned into an unique status where rolling transfers the blind and not the mobs (or just make the mobs friendly for that matter), it'd be far more fun.
---
the extra 150% gets you about 6 silver extra per envelope from what i've seen
---
Because they're both messed up. 
---
They can refer to Planetside 2 to make it easier for a single player to occupy a stronghold, rather than doing nothing.
---
Thanks for the replies folk.
---
Always go to a new instance when you see this, find a LFG and move into a new map, or guest on a different server. I've been having it a lot as well.
---
CDProject Red is now like:  
---
Hold my beer and watch this. 
---
Haven't played the game in one year and half, started doing fractals again and birds actually gave me ptsd. 
---
Also you can notice that every other mistlock instability has a good name or a decent one. This mistlock instability is just Birds. Like why try as a developer to give a description (or a name ) to the most annoying mistlock instability ever
---
Haha agreed :D
---
Lately, the solution for most fractals has been resistance spam on Diviner Rev and I'm loving it
---
On what sample size? If you just counted it once or twice from your daily 16 that's hardly a fair comparison.  
---
I use all of them and all of their skills/utilities constantly.  They've fit in so nicely that I can't remember or imagine moving around Tyria without them.  A well deserved shout-out on this one.
---
If someone hates it so much that they stop doing fractals, is it doing its job ?
---
There are literally no tooltips on the game that list CC (x number), here's a very intentional example of an attack that is supposed to knockback multiple times that shows that https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Repeating_Shot
---
And thank you for proving my point that the only people who really have an issue with Surge of the Mists is salty Chronos. Chrono is still incredibly useful and undoubtedly meta in many places, I don't think having a *single* viable alternative is doing anyone harm. This whole thread is pointless.
---
Gw2 has that content. Tournaments in pvp, raids and wvw. Are they as focused by Anet as they should be ? Its another topic to discuss but we do have that sort of content you're talking about. 
---
I remember those times too, and while they were good, when I look back with attention, the most chat I had with people was because I've standing for hours in the same spot doing the same thing and was so bored if I didn't start a conversation with someone I would go mad. 
---
As a chrono main I absolutely hated it when birds spawn during boonstacking and getting me into combat thus preventing me using mistlock. 
---
Could you provide the data in text form? Just A and R columns would do even.
---
So now we have the horrible firebrand and renegade meta for fractals which is dumb, constricts the flexible DPS slot to only one spot, and good luck finding 4 people to replace 2 chronos in raids if you think using them is a good idea. (it isn't, they suck, do no dps, and have poor utility)
---
I hear you :'(
---
Well... Thieves, more specifically acrobatics thieves and daredevils don't mind too much. Core thief can reduce endurance regen to about 5secs, and has a healing ability and utility for that.
---
Daredevils... Pretty obvious.
---
But I can't imagine how rough it is for other professions.
---
I don't want my life to be dominated by a game mode on a video game. If you looked at my average time spent playing sPvP in a day over the past 9 months it probably averages around 15-20 minutes a day, tons of days where I didn't play and also many days where I was in the mood to grind pvp for a few hours.
---
In those 9 months of playing 15 minutes a day I completed the legendary back piece, completed the light ascended PvP set, completed the normal glorious set, completed the Ruins of the Warbeast set and almost, made progress on a ton of dungeon collections and  finally I am close to achieving rank 100 and getting armour set you can unlock at that point.
---
You can't call FB/Ren meta for fractals and then also call them terrible in every regard. If they were then Chrono/Druid would be 'meta' without any arguement. 
---
There is a special place in Hell for guys like you.
---
The blocks... they do nothing !
---
I'm already used to it. Unless you get like birds, frailty and mobs attack faster all at one, have bad teammates and do the new fractal, you'll be fine.
---
That's what I thought too. What about Ventrilo,Mumble? :D
---
Gamebryo isnt the reason that bethesdas games are so broken.
---
Fallout 4 isnt nearly as broken as Fallout 76, and Oblivion isnt as broken as Skyrim was.
---
It is purely bethesdas laziness to not improve/fix the aging parts in their engine.
---
There are plenty of ames made with gamebryo that work completely fine and arent a mess.
---
You could make WoW look like BDO, but that would need a full replacement of alle meshes, textures, materials, effects, shaders and an ehnancement of the rendering part of the engine.
---
It would be a lot of work, but not impossible.
---
But it would also be more practical to just use another engine for it instead of changing WoWs.
---
An engine isnt a static thing, its a toolset, not more, not less.
---
Most people confuse "Engine" and "Engine".
---
Whereas one of them is the tools used by the Devs, and the other is the real Core of it.
---
You can build broken games with Unity, or some of the most successfull games of our time (Hearthstone).
---
Its not gamebryos fault that bethesda just doesnt give a f*ck about all of the bugs they added over the years.
---
And the worst is, they will reuse this bug-collection for Starfield, and then for TES6, without fixing anyhing, and people will continue to blame the Engine for Bethesdas laziness.

How about making you actually find bounty not spawn in the same region everytime. 
---
Hovering over a location reveals your progress there, are you thinking that you missed an entire map somewhere? Map completion is only going to be core tyria anyways so there aren't a huge number to check.

Right, and how many different chair/table types will the average home really need? 
---
Hey, maybe they'll add a couch and a computer, where we can sit on our ass, playing a video game where our character sits on *their* ass, playing a video game.
---
There is the expand/collapse all button but it doesn't do anything. I guess I'll try reinstall then
---
Could be tomorrow, we usually don't know exact day of certain patches (except that it's always Tuesday). 
---
Yes, I think that I'm missing a whole map. I think I've finished all the maps that is not fogged. I've tried to go through from left to right, top to bottom to find missing map and couldn't find it. Now I'm trying to find it by making list of the maps for map completion. 
---
Thank you for your help.

Tuesday ^but^which^Tuesday
---
Indeed. This random damage also favors builds that can mitigate or outheal damage a lot, which lead to the mesmer/druid meta – something I feel ArenaNet wanted to discourage with the recent balance patches.
---
I just replied with the 6 maps to check in that case, shouldn't be too hard then to see which isn't done, good luck!
---
You can just run through that cave now. Anet secretly nerfed the spiders so you can run through with no swiftness, no dodges, no evades, no stealth and not get hit lol
---
That sounds wrong, you defo 110% sure your MF was always at 963% and that you only opened the 1g envelopes?
---
i don't think there is any ts servers, there are a few discord server though depending whether you are in na or eu   
---
anyway check this link and join whatever you like:

---
You are delusional beyond stupidity.  
---
Anet have basically said there will definitely be more expansion packs after more living world seasons.  
---
Whatever, you can't talk with inbred 12yr olds such as yourself.
---
nice
---
Oh shit... Wrong thread...
---
You will not find any serious DPS comparisons for ranged damage, because melee damage is almost always superior anyway, so that is what all the benchmarks and theorycrafters focus on.
---
Since your stated goal is "solo archer playstyle", consider this comparison:
---
* Dragonhunter uses a longbow to shoot light. At least one of the core rotation skills roots you, but you get a fancy angel wings swoop movement skill to compensate.
---
* Berserker uses a longbow to shoot fire. Some of that fire stays on the ground, not necessarily on the target. Height differences and gaps in the ground between you and your target can be problematic. Condi based, which has its own inherent set of pros and cons.
---
* Soulbeast uses a longbow to shoot arrows. You do not need to ever leave beastmode. As close as it gets to straight up, pure *'shoot things until they stop moving'* style.
---
Please no.
---
This is how mimics get you.
---
Fair enough, I didn't clear dailies that day but I assumed heavy projectile management was probably key.
---
No instability should force us to use a specific class but I'll remember that my hunch was correct for next this happens, thanks for confirming :)
---
Blurry text happens when the 'ignore UI' part of the Hook bugs out.
---
Blurry cutscenes comes from depth-of-field shaders. I suggest binding a key to disable/enable DOF.
---
Just as side note: 2 chronos get replaced by 2 firebrands and 1 renegade. And if you want you can spec the renegade to heal
---
I can sympathize with PvP balance issues but this is really not the place to discuss it.
---
As written above, it is not a matter of difficulty.
---
It's about how playing the content feels when this is on and to me it feels noticeably worse.
---
Nordic/viking tattoos are pretty popular, so it'll look good and have context outside of GW2.
---
They claim that upgrading to DX12 would only result in small performance gains whereas in reality the dx12 mod offers a massive performance boost (25+% FPS and no FPS drops) if you have modern pc hardware.
---
15 years here played all kinds of mmos and i could never ever ever again imagine playing games where you get better and better gear by doing the same stuff over and over hoping for a drop.... I hate any kind of grind or long time to level up...
---
GW2 is simply the best and perfect system, you install the game get to max level in a second and get best in slot gear in 2 seconds.
---
After that time to do all the story and achievements or even the grind side of gw2 which is legendary's.
---
You mean we should change our gear just because of an instability ?
---
Swapping out traits and utilities is fair but what you are suggesting requires specific gear and a specific class, this is not an answer.
---
Besides, as stated in OP, it's not a matter of difficulty.
---
Xfire or gtfo
---
Yeah I noticed that the blurry text doesn't always happen. Also I've started to prefer no DoF as it both eats a few precious FPS and makes the overall image too mushy for my taste.
---
No shinies? You no longer honorary skritt!
---
I agree i despise most instabs but love them
---
Oh my god, I forgot that XFire even existed. And I even used it for a couple of months too.
---
I think this isn't an issue. Fractals aren't supposed to be easy and just simple to run through. Anet designed this to be end content . It's supposed to be challenging. 
---
Yes the damage from birds hurt, yes we.bleed fire burns deal lots of damage. But I think it's how they supposed to increase difficulty of the current fractals. 
---
It's like every time there is a remotely new or challenging content this whole community starts crying about it and arenanet can only simplify the content making it full and boring like everything else in this game.
---
So pls stop crying about content that isn't as easy as doing map completion for the 6th time in Caledon forest.
---
Consistently lacking a QA team..?
---
To be honest, almost every new or reworked instability feels like guys didn't test a thing but slapped new code and call job done - the Social Awkwardness and Slippery Slope inside Underground Facility on launch day just confirmed this.
---
The difference between a 5 v 5 match and a 2 v 2 match is a good player can win a 1 v 2, there is no way you are going to win over 5 other players no matter how good they are solo, but fighting 1 v 2 is doable.
---
I used trapper runes on my guardians which made me invisible, i put all my traps in my base and hoped they would come. If they did not come i would fight them 1 v 2, when i got downed i brought out my other guardian.
---
Thats not match manipulation, thats me fighting 1 v 2. At this time i had 4 accounts, i have never signed up for a 5v5 league tournament while multiboxing beacuse who would want to play with 1 proper player and 3 smurfs.
---
I have the same GPU (GTX 960) than what the author tested the mod with (although he didn't mention if it was the 2GB or 4GB model) *but* I have "only" i5-6600 @3.3-3.7 GHz instead of i7-7700 and yes, my framerate became more constant but I'm actually getting lower average FPS, probably because of the increased CPU load. I know my CPU is only quad core but it's still a fairly modern and has good single-core performance and it's probably better than what a lot of people have.
---
So, I have no idea if an official DX12 patch would act the same but if it did it could potentially screw up the performance for lots of people with less than stellar hardware. My CPU usage basically increased from around 70-80% to close to 100% and I was dropping to even low 20s when simply standing at the lunar new year festival area in Divinity's Reach while without the mod I was hovering at around 28-35 FPS in the same situation. Also without the mod dropping the shadows from ultra to high could boost the FPS to over 40 while with the mod it did nothing, probably cause my CPU was maxed out.
---
Just a little anecdote here to remind that the mod is not for everyone.
---
I mean, singleplayer games can have a world that feels alive so I don't mind having something soloable that I can do at my own pace.
---
I started killing birds in real life with my air gun because of this instability.
---
I had no problem with birds until I set up my holosmith for t4. I can't see wtf is going on half the time on that character so by the time I see I've got birds on me I'm screwed.
---
We've never seen Kralkatorrik's full body, only ever his head (and neck). 
---
What we've seen is the Shatterer, but that's just one of his generals.
---
For me the common issue is with the Sauna "shower room" where chest either spawns inside wall or in the another room and the "Lava" maze - where I had broken unlootable chests three times already
---
Found he project manager
---
Pugging is cancer ppl ping legendary armor + a stack of LI and cant even throw a bomb on fucking sab.
---
Indeed they can but I would highly disagree that many of the techniques for single player games apply to MMORPGs. Opposite actually, the solo story missions create a dead world not alive, even if you enjoy them.
---
I thought this was very obvious for you already if we look at your upvotes. You spammed it here on reddit, you make up situations in GW2 that i would not belive anyone would think or expect and when someone reply you just goes on about your issue without even a thought about the answer you got and put in ridiculous accusations or expectations.
---
If you want people to listen to what you say you might want to reconsider how you write it. This way is not the way to get people to feel for your cause and look in to it.
---
If you get empty or buried chests then try to find a difference map instance. The chest locations are per instance so a different instance will hopefully get you working chests. You're still limited to a maximum of 2 chests per room though.
---
I wouldn't really say that I'm making "a big deal" out of it, but rather noting the fact that most of their comments suggest they're going down a route I personally believe would be bad.
---
It's only devolved into a long discussion about it because you asked for clarity on it and we've been having a back and forth furthering said clarification. :I
---
&gt; but I mean, we carried the egg, defended it, we taught her, we played with her, we built not one but two seperate nests for her.
---
Carried it for literally two halves of two separate missions (rest of the time was Caithe). Our teaching her and playing with her amounted to treating her more like a pet, and the nests were both fully optional.
---
In all honesty, the Chuka and Champawat collections felt far more engaging than our teaching Aurene.
---
Not sure if it was this thread or another, but even Taimi acts to Aurene like she's a pet more than an intelligent sapient being. And I kind of feel that, until Episode 4, the Commander treated her that way too.
---
Ive been raiding since release ;) I know you mean well with that suggestion, and thanks for taking the time to make it... but... for me the bloom is off.
---
The thing about raids is, that Anet treats that part of the community with neglect and even tries to keep it down as much as possible. Dear me, dont let raids become a thing. Thats the general feeling you get when looking at the system. Weekly timegate to make repeating raids as unlucrative as possible, one time rewards on cms so you wont be tempted to repeat them. No longterm goals, not even titles for beating dhuum 1000 times.
---
Add to that the power creep from PoF without any adjustments... well... Im sorry, but raids are 10man dungeons to me, with currently exceedingly bad balancing. Just waiting for anet to introduce instabilities to them and call it quits on developement. The later one will happen rather sooner than later, I promise you that.
---
Don't change map instance unless you've opened all the rooms though. The plate rotation is per instance and the rooms that aren't in the rotation for that instance will just have the same colour plate in them.
---
The GuildChat that came after All or Nothing did show a render that also showed shoulders and a wing of Kralkatorrik, so we may get his full body.
---
I shouldn't laugh... but I read it in his voice 
---
I highly discourage to commanding a zerg until extremely experienced.  
---
Right now, the power creep inside a zerg vs zerg (or blob vs blob) fight is so high that a single position mistake will wipe your entire team.  
---
Most of the commanders nowadays are baiting the enemies to make such movement mistakes, so this would only bring frustration to a new commander.   
---
If they will ever follow you, of course. If you're not a well know commander, the chances that the players inside the map will straight ignore you ( as long you're not tagging up to point out an imminent objective capture ) is really really high. 
---
Right now in the dat, it's just the head and neck. But a showing from GuildChat showed shoulders and wing, suggesting in Episode 6 we may get to see his full body.
---
But your best hope is to ping u/that_shaman or Vyko over on the official forums/wiki. They've both pulled it out of the dat already to show off compared to other Elder Dragon renders.
---
I would argue healing/support scrapper has got a home in an effective zerf
---
what also seems to be common practice is complaining if content is a nuisance, as you describe it, rather than accepting the structural design to be a nuisance because they are instabilities.
---
however, i do agree with your tip on birds spawning as ally rather then enemy. It makes sense to spawn as ally since they are dealing damage to enemies. but now you still have to deal with birds after the dodge. 
---
I don't think it's fair to call people team 1, 2 and 3 when people constantly change between them. 
---
Sieran and Taimi. They are lively, fun, entusiastic characters.
---
Been doing that to blackbirds with my suppressed 10/22 for over a decade now.
---
Surprising how much it will save on cat/dog food for outside pets.
---
I do seasonal changes to my guild's hall, but I have a few sections that are year round decorations. I have SAB in the sky, my "friends" on the hill, Trophy row and a few other areas. I love showing it off to anyone who wants to come visit because I am the sole scribe and decorator at this point. :)
---
Anet pls
---
What makes soloing lupi easier on other classes compared to necro? 
---
I haven't played other classes that much, so I don't know much of their skillsets. 
---
While our team enjoyin fight for the boss and chatting in the same time, i mean while we are having FUN. These flying fockers instantly spawning in the boss CC phase and ruin every damn CC skills. As a playing Berserker, when the CC phase Starts im using HeadButt... guess what focking MISS and trying to gain adrenaline for damage and...and... When finally im in berserk mode using burst(f1) skill guess what again? Focking MISS. 
---
Spacial thanks to Anet. 10\10 gameplay enjoyment.
---
Yeah man, they comment on the dumbest shit ever on this subreddit but not on the things that really matter. Such an endorsement, imagine other companies having 2 dedicated people who reply or communicate on reddit but not ArenaNet because they are that special, yeah, I think autistic is the word that suits them best. But you keep living in you own world, it's alright.
---
Yes, this worked for élite skills. Every boss was "unique" cause he could drop a special item and you could steal the Skill from him. This was really a good mechanic 
---
1. Don't insult me. Did I insult you? Told anything about you as a person? No. Then please, show any respect to the person you are talking to.
---
2. Show me quotes, then I'll believe you. I do believe, that there won't be any expansions, only living seasons from now on.
---
Yep, forgot to mention that! Finish your rooms, then swap instance.
---
The fact is that a lot more people care about mounts than about speed-clearing 6 year old content
---
Everyone can relate to the success of mounts.
---
Fractal speed clears, not so much, and not one of hte most boring ones there is.
---
Its just an acsended weapon/skin it is not legendary and has no time investment
---
The fact that you believe fractal records, or any records in any game, should interest more than very niche group of people is laughable.
---
Not really, you just have to adapt. You can't expect 2 glass cannon players to duo champ bounties easily. But if you go with 1 DPS and 1 Support/Tank than you can do most champ bounties. I've been running champ bounties with a friend for a while and I usually play firebrand and he some kind of DPS and most of the bosses are no problem.
---
This is raw gold only.  This doesn't count selling the things that can be sold on the TP.  I didn't bother including those since the prices fluctuate.
---
Well, try ignis with some shitty instabilites with 50 people, it doesn't get easier. 
---
More gold.  If you're capped on MF from luck then there's not really a benefit to hoarding it.
---
I do hope we see Braham's norn version of Destiny's Edge in game someday, perhaps in a Jormag vs. Primordus double trouble expansion. Even if Braham did the heavy lifting by using his fire-enchanted bow to fell Icebrood on the way to Jormag, I'd imagine that the rest of his DE 2.0 would be quite capable norn warriors regardless to allow their rag-tag team to make it all the way to the Elder Dragon through the bitter cold and thousands of Icebrood unscathed. The story could even help justify Braham's anger issues retroactively by showing that he knew some of these DE 2.0 beforehand and that they might've been toxic friends who helped fuel his grief and anger and supported his separation from the Commander. :)
---
I'd still be opening them if I tried to do that nonsense. :P
---
Oh man this post is pretty much what we were saying while fractaling last night. Dodge birds... Have no dodge for mechanics.... Dodge mechanics get screwed by birds.
---
This instability hasn't made fractals fun. Exactly the opposite in fact. 
---
Kind of an assumption on mesmer portals. I've had the same issue with chests yesterday, probably just a simple bug fix incoming
---
I will insult you all I want, especially when you are chatting verbal diarrhea.  
---
I have 0 respect for idiocy.
---
&gt;we are lvl 8 or 9
---
Did you play for like half an hour?
---
I've bought like 12 character upgrades and 8 shared inventory slots (and a ton of bank slots) with gold. Only spent money a couple times (... For more character slots...)
---
Posts on reddit, dulfy and wiki, you have to combine the data yourself
---
Some things to note:
---
1) Its not 250 gold outright, its total. So if you're a player who doesn't want to spend their entire morning gold farming you can just farm gold when you hit the wall during the collections.
---
2) Farming gold isn't too hard if you decide to go past the 250 needed and save up some spending money. To be honest I consider gold the most used but weakest currency in the game compared to the others like Fractal Relics, Laurels, Winterberries, etc where you can't endlessly farm most of them unlike gold or gold-replacement currencies like Unbound/Volatile Magic (since you don't use typically gold to buy ascended trinkets from most LW3/4 vendors).
---
But the fun stuff in game is the stuff that gives the best gold too. Fractals and raids (and before those, dungeon speedruns)
---
Yeah, you'll reach in there and lose an arm!!
---
DPS Rene, FB and Druids are NOT a thing in PROPER fractals and you should rarely encounter that "problem". A dps chrono sure works out, but that is a complete different matter.
---
Ahh! Thank you!
---
Do i have to complete my personal Story first to start it?
---
I have a guild group. But you would be forced to join PUGs with a daily system
---
Take the horns off and it's Puff, the Magic Dragon
---
Play further than lv 8 or 9 and you wouldn't have had to make this post. :)
---
&gt; wardrobe
---
* Some skins do not show as locked in the wardrobe and are instead hidden until the skin is unlocked.
---
cool story but completely irrelevant, since its still match manipulation
---
Procession of Blades&gt;Spear of Justice&gt;Symbol of Wrath&gt; Whirling Wr-Birds, opening burst is now fucking gone, very fun.
---
Try ReShade loader, it's available on arc's page (unsupported). No guarantee it'll work but it's worth a shot
---
Just so you know, clicking and tapping (of keyboards in this case) is also “true ASMR” as it’s something that is employed very often in videos. The video is mundane though with too much static noise. Thank you for your feedback! 
---
I really liked the Skill Hunter/"cap sig" feature of GW1 - that was probably my favorite aspect of the game.
---
1. There is a main questline. The Personal Story progresses every 10 levels, and after the Personal Story ends you have Living World seasons two, three, and four. New story episode come out every 2-3 months.
---
2. Exploring the open world and doing events/map completion is really the only way to level your first time around.
---
3. You must own PoF to have access to mounts. There are boons like Swiftness that make you move faster in addition to some class specific skills (warrior greatsword 3&amp;5, Blink on Mesmer, etc).
---
4. Each weapon has different skills for each class; each weapon is effectively unique. The way a Ranger uses a greatsword is completely different from the way that Mesmer uses a greatsword. Classes have access to Elite Specializations at level 80 that allow classes to use weapons that the base classes cannot and will modify/introduce new profession mechanics.
---
5. This game doesn't have a hard trinity, but it doesn't inherently mean that an Elementalist could become a "tank" if they wanted to (traditional tanking does not exist in GW2 outside of 10-man raids). The game is open ended in the sense that classes are not locked to specifically one "role". The meta in GW2 is quite dynamic and different raid bosses will have different meta compositions. The DPS meta is very diverse and optimal DPS classes vary from boss to boss, while the support meta is very stagnant in raids.
---
6. This game is not P2W. The Gem Store has convenience, nothing that will give you an advantage over another player.
---
7. Going to be honest with you, class balance is definitely one of the worst things about GW2 across all game modes. That being said, it has been getting much better over time so I don't want that to deter you from playing the game, because the balance changes aren't going to have any real effect on you any time soon. I can't talk much about PvP specific details as out of the 7k hours I have in this game, I'd say about ~6-7 of them are in sPvP. It just isn't my cup of tea.
---
8. I used to play GW2 because I loved the world and lor of Tyria, and while I still love it dearly, instanced PvE (dungeons, Fractals, raids) is always where I have spent the bulk of my time. I dabble into WvW every now and then and I have quite a bit of fun with that as well.
---
hence why game developers jobs are so hard. I see your point. Maybe then it would  be a good way to buff and rework racial skills. 
---
I care about mounts, I don't care about fractals
---
HoT story is the only requirement as far as I recall. 
---
I would like to support, but i fear that i would be unable to do content in world pve if i wear a full support set :/  
---
\+ support boon chrono builds seems bad in WvW, and i will do some with a pvp-oriented friend :)
---
1) The main questline increments every 10 levels. So at level 10 you will get a few missions in a row, then again at level 20 etc. 
---
2) Hearts are designed to keep you in the areas that [Dynamic Events](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dynamic_event) occur. If you see an orange marker on your minimap or event info in the top-right of your screen, go and do it. These are the real quest replacements, and will provide you the best xp as well as giving you a bit of story on the area.
---
3) Mounts are free but only come with the Path of Fire expansion. You are "slow" because the game makes use of waypoints to fast travel between locations you have discovered. If you want to move faster, look for skills that give you the boon [swiftness](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Swiftness)
---
4) Skills vary between class and even race. At max level you will have ~15 skills available to you, between your 5 utility skills and two weapons.
---
5) Any class being able to dps means any class can dps. Currently every class has some build that is at least viable in endgame content. Endgame content has a wide variety of mechanics that will influence how good classes are on each encounter. Some classes are definitely better than others, but it's possible to do it all on any class.
---
6) The chest you found (they drop very frequently) contains cosmetics and convenience items. You can gain additional keys through completing maps and specific story steps (you will get one at the end of the level 10 chain). These items do not confer any power boost to characters and are unuseable in raid and PvP.
---
7) PvP is moderately well balanced, though there is a definite tier list. Skill also counts for a lot, so there is a lot of bad information about what these tiers are. Core builds are unfortunately almost always worse than the elite specialisations you get from expansions.
---
8) I have almost 10k hours and still adore most of the game. For me the combat system is the biggest draw - it is responsive and heavily based on skill and movement rather than just standing there firing off skills in a prescribed order. For me this makes raiding and fractals far more enjoyable than my experiences in other games, and I still find myself playing action games and wishing their combat was as good as GW2's.
---
Not to mention fractals like TO, Urban etc, with sugar rush, enraged, etc makes them a giant pain in the ass hole! That is NOT FUN.
---
1: "Forced"
---
2: then dont join shitters that require LI pings?
---
NO AEGIS BRUH?
---
They already promised more specializations and I don't see them reneging on that(unless the company closes). Besides, we're talking about a 'what if' scenario that we already know isn't going to happen to they have already announced an expansion after season 5.
---
It's laughable how you put words into my mouth:) 
---
1. Get to level 10 and you'll get the first chapter of the personal story. You unlock one every 10 levels, in the meanwhile you explore and complete maps to level up.
---
2. Explore and do hearts, the amount of exp you get from that is good enough. Keep in mind that GW2 is very exploration-based, leveling ends at lv 80 and from there the progression is just horizontal and in your own gaming skills. In any part of the game past the main story (which can be seen as just a huge tutorial/demo), like expansions and living story maps, there's nothing past that level, though in some areas there'll be enemies that require more skills to kill.
---
[3.You](https://3.You)'ll end up unlocking skills and utility that can improve your speed, but it's not /that/ bad as running speed. Mounts are unlocked with the Path of Fire expansion, so you won't be able to get them right away. Those you see in the Trading Post are just skins, not the actual mount.
---
4. Different weapons have different skills depending on the class. After level 10 you'll start getting Hero Points that you can spend to unlock Utilities that you can select and "equip" in the right part of your skillbar. Traits are unlocked after a while and are instead sort of "ability trees" you can use to personalize your build. Still, don't worry about specific builds for now, you'll gain enough Hero Points from mapping, story and leveling that you'll unlock all utilities and traits. Play what makes you feel nice.
---
5. Combat is the best I've seen in MMOs, but it's not your usual "Tank/DPS/Healer" thing. Roles are a bit more nuanced and require a good compehension of classes and game mechanics to be fully grasped (any class can do anything, but in their own way, which means that some classes will outperform others but not necessarily in all fields and niches), not to mention that different game modes require different roles, but as I said don't fret with these things. You'll learn them when the time is right, which is for sure after you've finished the personal story.
---
6. No. At most you can buy "quality of life" items (bigger bank slots, extra bags, all those things that make your life just slightly easier if you play a lot but you don't truly /need/), but nothing that will "win" the game for you. The chest you've dropped is a lootbox called Black Lion Chest, which requires keys that can be bought or just found in game (you'll get one soon after finishing the lv10 chapter and they can be farmed in a few ways as well, so it ain't that bad). You don't need anything from those to play, so don't worry.
---
7. I don't do much PvP, but I can answer as well. It's not at all the best-balanced PvP out there, but it's not as bad as you say as you need at least some skills to win. Some classes and builds are a tad overpowered, but an unskilled player will fail with them anyway. I'd suggest avoiding PvP for now anyway, at least until you finish the story and have a good grasp on your class.
---
8. The game itself is all I've ever wanted from a game, as there's an immense amount of content for me to choose from (exploration, PvP modes, "hard PvE" modes, story, chill activities, minigames, collections, achievements, etc) and I never feel pressured into having to do something I don't like just to get rid of the need to do it. The community is one of its stronger points, you'll always find people willing to help or just be nice to new and old players, it really warms my heart to see such niceness.
---
In their defence, DBL as it is right now with gliders, no stupid jungle/canon meta in the center of the map and more ways to get around the map is much better for both zerg gameplay and roaming.
---
It's unfortunate though - the damage has already been done to the point where people only point to the fact that DBL was an abomination at release. Even though it's much better now, many people including myself just don't play there due to perceived lack of players and prior trauma.
---
To be perfectly fair, that's probably how much damage a headshot would do to you.
---
What the others already said. You only have to complete the HoT story. 
---
But also be aware of that each class have a weapon collection that is also ascended. Some of the HoT one like the Great Sword for Reaper (necro) and the staff for DareDevil (thif) looks pretty epic and can be worth getting as well.
---
&gt;maybe I've looked at the game the worng way
---
You havent even began playing the game, handholding process will beginn when you hit level 10
---
I kind of want a weekend-only event of mounts just to see what chaos it would bring, but yeah, definitely don't want them implementing mounts long-term. There are just way too many uncertainties, balance issues and kinks to work out and Anet probably realizes this so I'm like 95% sure it's not going to be mounts.
---
The very wording of your picture is enough to present your bias towards one of the subjects, clown :)
---
I think he's trying to tell you that Reddit, and most GW2 communities, don't value speed runs on old content. They tend to be more interesting for ppl doing speed runs, and in a 7 year old game that number is not very large. But keep trying to manufacture something interesting, dumbass
---
If we're talking fractal bugs, I'll hijack a thread a bit because there is a chance fractal dev will look at it.
---
--------------------
---
Elementalist downed skill #2 Vapor Form spawns additional fractal avenger at the end of the skill. This interaction was removed in a patch on 20th september 2016, but now it's back again.
---
So they are Shitters because they are not willing to carry you?
---
1. Yes, there is. You get personal story chapters every 10 levels. After that you have living world story, with season 1 being unavailable due to how it was released originally. You have season 2 available to buy with gems (which you either get with real money or you exchange in-game gold for). Then it's first expansion Heart of thorns followed by living world season 3, Path of Fire Expansion and the current living world season 4. Each of those you have to buy. Living world episodes are unlocked for free if you log in while said episode is the newest one.
---
2. Experience is gained by doing literally anything in the game. You get it for heart quests, for events (the orange circles that appear on maps), from killing random mobs and from exploring. As for fast experience gain, look out for events around the maps, they give a lot of exp and most of them give credit to heart quests.
---
3. Base walking speed feels quite slow, especially on big races like norns and charr. You can speed yourself up by getting the swiftness boon - it's a buff that gives 33% speed increase. All classes have various ways to gain it. Mounts are a part of the Path of Fire expansion, so in order to unlock them you need the expansion (obviously). Each has a different cost, with the raptor being the first to unlock and a cost of 1g.
---
4. You're still at the very start of the game, so you have a limited variety of skills. Each class has access to different weapons each with it's unique skills, resulting in 5 weapon skills. You said you're a ranger, so you should be able to use longbow, shortbow, greatsword, sword, dagger, torch, axe and warhorn. You have a healing skill slot, 4 utility skills and an elite skill (ultimate) Soon you should be able to start buying skills, so you will get a bit more variety. You get further build options when you unlock trait lines, which you also buy with hero points. Look wise they will get flashier as you go along, for better or worse. Legendary weapons add effects to your skills as well.
---
5. Yes, in theory any class can tank/DPS/heal, but some are better at things then other - that's only natural. Currently there's a large variety of builds you can play, and each class has at least one viable build. As far as raids are concerned you're bound to get different opinions - some say they are too hard, others that they are too easy. I'd say they are great fun and definitely worth trying out. Keep in mind that they are also gated behind the expansions, so you won't be able to access them on a f2p account. What you can do however is fractals, which is gw2 version of traditional dungeons (the dungeons currently in the game are scrapped content, though good for leveling and getting gear)
---
6. It is not a pay to win game, unless you consider needing to buy expansions to get elite specialisations as such. Elite specs are like an add on to your class that changes the way it plays, while still keeping the core mechanics of the class (kinda). While the game is advertised as free to play, it's more of a very generous free trial that lets you try out almost all the game has to offer, with some restrictions. Cash shop has only cosmetics and convenience items.
---
7. PvP is.... not fun at the moment. I'd recommend to stay away from it in its current state. 
---
8. Personally I find the best enjoyment when playing with my friends, as cheesy as this is. The game has so much to offer, but if you play solo it's boring and unrewarding. I've spent countless nights/early mornings roaming around in wvw, just messing around with friends. (wvw = world Vs world, the server Vs server PvP we have)
---
This should be all I think. Hope this answers your question and feel free to ask more! 
---
yea sorry it was my bad for not watching with sound on, regarding the grub summon..however the rest pretty much still stands
---
there are no teammates to rez with staff and it's part of the reason you are no-dps..because you use staff, stability mantra, blink..not sure about your traits but you have no quickness so timewarp would be better(also no alacrity also shield is better than staff both defensively and offensively)..if you would melee you would free 2 utility slots for something like disenchanter which would boost your damage considerably
---
you are basically creating problems by ranging and fixing them by crippling your build further..it's self-sabbotage
---
i don't think it's a good point to argue, being able to do lupi with whatever weapons and gear..i don't think you should make recommendations in the style of "whatever you use works fine" in a guide
---
this isn't just in this case, it's honestly pretty frustrating to keep seeing replies popping up around this subreddit about just using random stuff because it can work
---
having the video around is fine because you obviously intended it for a friend of yours but it's simply not a good guide overall
---
We have a 3rd competitor. This guy just shot his first legendary with his cell phone.
---
&gt; They might be difficult with a few people, but bounties were made to be the group content of PoF
---
Didn't they say that bounties were supposed to be very scalable content that would groups small-to-large something to do?
---
Or am I remembering wrong?
---
We bleed fire and birds together on twilight Oasis last week.  WBF is essentially just "take 4 burn stacks every few seconds" where the burn stacks are high damage and last what?  5?  10 seconds?
---
Birds is only 1k damage and blinds but happens SO OFTEN god forbid if your DPS involved a channeled attack like condizerk or tempest, take some damage and be blinded.
---
Add to Twilight Oasis where you're already dodging a multitude of attacks and mechanics.  It was legitimately one of the worst experiences in fractals for a while.
---
Seems like you are triggered. You are pathetic
---
I'm willing to bet that there is at least one tower or keep where you can raptor leap off of a tall area outside of the border and even though you'll be dismounted, your forward momentum will get you over the wall.
---
If they legit did have mounts, I'd want some kind of restriction such as specialized mounts that don't have a dismount attack, can be CCed/immobilized (which dismounts the target) and are used as utility for things like pack-yakking extra supplies or siege, with their movement speed capped at the maximum ooc mobility (base movement speed + 33% increase I believe).
---
Chrono has more potential burst, but you're never going to get all of that off. On top of that, it's easier to counter. Power Mirage isn't as easy to play as the IH condi duel build, but it's almost as strong in duels and much more mobile.
---
So for me basically 760g 32s extra.. hmmm
---
Birds should only spawn if you haven’t dodged for X seconds. 
---
Destiny's Edge too has to be a subplot when Jormag reawakens, or it's just gone for no good reason.
---
Oh, and if anyone wants to chuck me a friend request, I'm Fury.8536 :)
---
It’s definitely a weird medium. Check out the last link in my description for a short 3 minute or so clip on what it is. 
---
Umm actually mirage is fairly strong on Dhuum. Behind Renegade and a well played power chrono, but ahead of anything else.. Definitely ahead of a Berserker...
---
I am still really, really hoping that's the plot for Season 5... Along with tying up the loose end that is Malyck and replacements for Z and M. Kind of like Season 3 with multiple plots, but with 9 episodes since 6 is far too few, with the main one being about the charr-human treaty (including but not limited to: cleansing the Foefire with Wade Samuelsson and a reforged Magdaer, Bangar breaking the treaty and plunging the charr into a proper civil war, and Smodur finally taking action about him having the Claw and people expecting him to take the title of Khan-ur, whether he does or doesn't), and a finale that leads into the DSD becoming a threat that would be the focus of Expansion 3.
---
You don't need four people to replace two chronos in raids. You only need three because the Renegade can apply alacrity to ten players. Hell, you can even use a chrono in the second sub for the utility (focus pull, strong tanking kit). The hybrid composition is great because the Chrono doesn't need to rely on Tides of Time for alacrity (you could even use sword / sword and sword / focus). 
---
yes, buds, I know what I am commenting on lol
---
the game has no monthly pay wall so, they need to make money elsewhere.
---
some tough logic to get behind, I know
---
*Yoshi
---
Can confirm, it'll be something like this, although doing lots of crowded events will probably ramp that up a bit.
---
Slippery slope is still the worst, but birds is by far the most annoying.
---
The worst time I've ever had in fractals was when my group was waiting on the boss for solid ocean (we always start around x:40-45 and wait at boss til reset) with birds.  Normally we AFK a few minutes and make snacks, bathroom break, whatever until x:58, but obviously you can't do that with the fucking birds.  Had multiple people die because we were trying to stand off to the side and not draw aggro and such.
---
As has already been pointed out multiple times, the new instabilities add NOTHING to gameplay except frustration and annoyance.
---
So it seems that the game can run pretty smoothly on DX12.  So that tells me that this game is pushing the limits of DX9 and the game itself is pretty optimized, we just need it updated to support higher than DX9.
---
I agree generally speaking loading projectile management should solve the whole outflanked at siren's reef mess and I am mostly fine with this instability.
---
What I am saying is that saying "this specific build with this specific gear solved the issue so there is no issue" is a not a valid argument IMO.
---
More importantly this is really not the point of this thread.
---
berzerk spec with bow is a pretty strong condi damage dealer :)
---
I have soloed H&amp;M with 5 different classes (ranger, guardian, thief, revenant, and necro:  I wanted all 5 versions of Caladbolg, not just the skins).  I never tried warrior because I never got the feel for it in PvE, have done viper warrior in raids though.  I actually felt the easiest time i had fighting Mordy was with the revenant.  One problem sometimes is the updraft stage where you do not want to get hit, there is a tree limb in one area you can try to land on to protect against that.  Otherwise, it's a matter of switching between ranging to heal and avoid damage and melee burst when at full health (depends on class), that's what I usually did.  Passive healing abilities can help too (that's what let my rev tank most of the time).
---
I agree; on multiple points you have made a lot of sense.
---
here is an unpopular opinion: birds are the least bad of the new instabilities(maybe sugar rush is milder)
---
between we bleed fire, outflanked, slippery it's honestly not a big deal and their pressure is very small so you can delay dodging a bit to line it up with evading some other attack/mechanic
---
yea getting blinded sucks and so is having to dodge right after you already did for something else
---
But the networking is different. 
---
Honestly support Chrono gear is almost all standard power gear at this point. Plus some diviners stuff that you get from the latest living world map. I run it PvE no problem.   Including with my WvW guild.
---
Aand then there's ~~Moaning Myrtle~~ Glint.
---
I created an account just so i could upvote this
---
I am lazy simply because I played a lot of Soulworker and even tho it looked nice, in the end it was all about doing the same 2 dungeons on spam in the endgame and I basically wasted 1k hour on that game so I figured I might aswell ask the veterans here on Reddit. Btw for the skills I meant as visual effect if they stayed the same or changed
---
PoF griffon is Mirage of PvE. They should at least get a breakbar like the one in Bitterforst.
---
I have more interest in Link to the Past or Super Metroid speedruns than Fractal speedruns.
---
 Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaay you got it hahaah
---
+1 Dragonball for you 
---
Go into the pvp lobby and click on the helmet at the top of your screen. Then look up the rune/sigil you want in that build menu. If it isn’t unlocked yet you will be able to do it there for a few gold.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/PvP_Build
---
You just modify your build. No need to buy them. Look at the top of your screen. You will see the button for you to change your PvP build. 
---
In the pvp lobby at the top of your screen
---
Enter the PvP lobby, a bew build interface will appear on the top Middle of the screen you have switch sigils freely and buy the ones that are not free and and then swap them without a cost attached. Same for the amulets and runes.
---
Way behind what?  Anyone raiding for a good amount of time now has enough LI for many sets of Leggy Armor.  They have no other use.  LD will be used for the trinket and likely nothing after that.  You would never get behind anyone.
---
1) Every 10 levels and then A LOT of story on lvl 80. So you are nearly on your first part.
---
2) There is no rush in exping fast. You better enjoy the game, explore maps, places, speak with NPCs, hear stories...but if it isn't your thing, then experience is percentual gains, so it does not matter what level you are and what level of mobs you kill, it is bound to your level and you get always a fraction of your needs towards to next level. BUT there are way to get bonus exp, that is for mobs that have not been killed by any player for long (usually those non-agressive mobs around), by boosters (guild boost, booster you can get from level-up reward, FOOD and UTILITY consumables that reward you +10% kill exp, and probably a bit more)...the most exp is for EVENTS.
---
3) There is usually some skill that grants swiftness. Then you can move faster. However the game is not a race. Mounts are part of expansion, so only available once you buy it. The free2play is just very glorified demo (whole part that was original release and soething on top of it), so you have plenty of time to get the idea if you like it or not, before you buy expansion. Consider it still as Buy2Play, with very generous demo.
---
4)Skills for weapons are final, however you will learn utility skills (the right side of skillbar) and those synergize with the rest :) Also there is more weapons, each has different playstyle.
---
**Also in this game, it is not skills nor stats on armor, that gets better (except first levels when you learn stuff), but your gaming personal skill should get better.** The point is that you can get good with same tools, do combos, synergies, and so on (some even need more persons at once to happen). That is the real depth that will show up once you level up...and level up your personal skill.
---
5)Combat system is good. First levels don't show much of it so you can't judge yet (and shouldn't).
---
6) No pay2win, unless your win is shiny skin...Those keys are usually got from story quests, for map completion, or as super rare drop, so they can be get very easily via gameplay. And later, once you buy at least one expansion, you will be able to convert gold to gems, buying them from the store.
---
7) Balance is good, but not on 1vs1 scale. It is all balanced around 5vs5, where in 1vs1 dimension you can see rock-paper-scissors weaknesses and strenghts...so you always have to know your powerful parts and use them. Or run and get help from teammate when someone counters your build.
---
8) Just chilling in the game. No rush anywhere, just doing whatever happens around. Even if it is just "daily reccomended" activity, it means every day to do something different, with different people if not taking my friends, and just...playing. For fun. For the environment. You can totally miss all of this if you will want to be instantly max level or go for highest gold/hour activities.
---
The worst thing is, we have this tilting instab every day on at least 2 dailies/recs.
---
Im okay with instabilities having downsides only, but birds feel way too overloaded compared to the others. It blinds you, makes you dodge, deals damage, spawns multiple mobs that deal damage, if you're down they will finish you off cause you can't rally off of them. Vindicators at least give you a chance.
---
When I first read the reveal I thought the birds would randomly target someone with a warning, like flux bomb, so the player can dodge and avoid any consequences if he's paying attention. Do that, my thing is good.
---
In the time it took them to write this post they probably would have been close to 30-40 :V
---
Ok I edited the post and thanks again everyone for your help, one last question: which crafting materials that mob drops should I keep? since I don't have much space in inventory... I saw some stack up to 250 but since I just started maybe they are just not worth keeping? (don't have much space and where is the bank?)
---
**TASTE ONE THOUSAND AXES**
---
I mean the game is still b2p. Your implying any game without a monthly sub is f2p?
---
I have the same problem, I wish there was a cutscene volumw slider.
---
"Know why they call me Axemaster? Cause no survives me taking my gun out and shooting them in the face to talk about it."  
---
Arh... I see. Seems like thief is the prefered solo class. Just a shame thief is the class I like the least.
---
By what criteria? It's not DPS, that's for sure.
---
I once trolled one of them for a *very* long time (juicy glassy staff weaver) by either dodging or reflecting his shots, depending on cooldowns. 
---
Maybe they didn't realise that I could perfectly see whenever I got marked, and thus had a solid idea on when the burst was about to come out, but the sweetheart always gave me enough time to double attune Earth for the aura! If staff skills weren't so slow, I'd have been able to succesfully counterburst the little shit, but they always got away with a sliver of health.
---
Just rub some dirt on whatever is left of your upper torso.
---
Is there an API site that would show when a Guild Race has been started on a certain map?
---
Guardian seems to be a good pick for you. Good damage and CC for personal story/living world as a Dragonhunter (HoT elite specialisation) and has the ability to be an excellent healer/buffer in WvW and Fractals as a Firebrand (elite specialisation introduced with the Path of Fire expansion).
---
Everything pvp related (not wvw) is given to you in the pvp lobby, except some which you need to spend 5 gold for some reason.
---
They should have things under the hood quite worked out already, the last update was that they do lack mostly front-end, which means to redo whole guild GUI and how guilds work...
---
So yea, rather wait a bit than get all guilds broken.
---
Can't wait to hear the next upcoming mount! 
---
That's what you get for onehitting all those innocent ambient creatures
---
I think that one of the most important things that wasn't said in the first posts is this:  
---
The game will award you experience for doing literally anything.
---
It will also award you experience if you are level 70 in a lvl 5 zone, it will also downscale you to the zone level, so that the content is still somewhat challenging. 
---
This means that you can do absolutely any content that is bellow your level whenever you feel like it.
---
i.e. you can run around the world leveling to level 60 and start doing the personal story and you will still feel rewarded and challenged. It's up to you what you want to do and when, and all zones matter at any point in time.
---
Maybe Power Chrono is something for you then? Invis, many blinks, blocks, boons and ports, and can dish some nice damage. But yea, try other content and maybe try it out another time, who knows, maybe you enjoy the faster way in the future. it's really hard to start "slow" soloing dungeons, usually you start out with skipping one part fast, when succeded the next part, etc. bit by bit, but fast. :S
---
Anyway gl and fun to you\^\^
---
Okay, I think logic is not your strong part. This does not make any sense. The comparison is just not applicable as reading a book is totally different as it is always released as a whole and a game like GW2 is always developing and adding new stories in it's lifetime. 
---
From a developer standpoint it does not make sense to bring back old content such as LS1 because there may be a ton of people here wanting it back but there may even be a bigger part of the community that are not vising reddit. And those people could either: 
---
1. Don't care about the LS1 that much.
---
2. Don't even want to play the old content because they did not like it.
---
3. Delay or lose fresh content as developers are busy bringing back old content instead of working on new stuff.
---
Also, the story of LS1 is not missing, you get a summary of it after finishing Zhaitan (iirc) and get to experience what happened and how to proceed in season 2. 
---
Almost like maybe they should of just gave them shortbow access instead
---
Way ahead of you.
---
why are mechanics causing you to adapt your play a bad thing? would you prefer fractals to be a dps golem with no mechanics?
---
yea all instabs are annoying welcome to fractals, all i would like changed would be stopping the adds from spawning but i dont mind if they dont change it bc you just dodge and delete this mechanic
---
Not all the concept art got turned into actual armor, unfortunately. However, it's safe to assume that the closest pieces will come from [asura cultural armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Asura_cultural_armor).
---
More specifically, the female asura most closely resembles [Prototype medium armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Prototype_armor) or maybe [Genius light armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Genius_armor)?
---
And the male asura honestly is too drapey to be anything particular from the cultural armor. You'd probably have to play with pieces from your wardrobe to try to get close.
---
thief is the easiest, necro is the hardest
---
you can solo pretty well on mesmer, guard, war, even ele etc.
---
Raptor generally "feels" better to me because it doesn't have the stop-and-start feel of the jackal teleports. I still use both though, raptor for mostly flat terrain and jackal for hilly terrain. 
---
It certainly is not an exception but it would help ArenaNet a lot of they ever said something on here. It's just frustrating. And yeah of course they are an exception, because their games are actually playable.
---
i don't think many ppl care about tryhards that did something in-game using 5x same best class
---
It's plenty good dps for soulbeast.
---
Yes.

Hey OP, I got stuck at that exact point a while back and have left it alone for awhile; so you’re not alone. I’m UK based too, although I don’t think I’ll be back on until the weekend now. I’ll look you up when I do get on and see if you’re still stuck.
---
"When I grow up I want to become a stellar nursery"
---
I think you're confusing "better skills" with "more skills".
---
Yes this game doesn't have as many skills on-screen as other mmos, but at least there's flavour to almost all of GW2's skills, and Rangers aren't stuck with 50 variations of "shoot arrow". Ranger Longbow only has 5 skills, true, but would more skills really make the weapon more complete?
---
I think they're headed in the right direction when it comes to instabilities, because, well, they're instabilities. However, I do see your point on a lot of things. Especially for the birds, there is just nothing you can do. At least with ones like Hamstrung, you can take a healer, or No Pain, No Gain, you can bring a boonstipper. 
---
I like the feeling that they make things seem less stable, which is what they're supposed to do, but birds is completely out of left field, and is the opposite of fun. It's good that some instabilities make people have to change tactics, but there is nothing to be done about birds other than taking more endurance-regenerating skills, which not all classes have, and man, it feels like as soon as I get the birds off me, they're right back on me and then I'm downed. 
---
There is no such thing as hardcore gameplay in NA servers, what we have it is a couple ppl that always run together and dont care about bringing new players in at all.
---
1. Ranger
---
2. Low mobility
---
You are talking about the MOST CASUAL MMORPG out there, like 2% of the game population care about hardcore endgame content:
---
Well, testing on actual pugs is probably unheard of. Otherwise these clusterfucks would be detected early. Like getting tentacle slapped or birds while on the button in dredge fractal. Or social awkwardness in aetherblade where there's literally not enough space for people with push bubbles in insta-down zappy field (bonus -- birds! Haha you can't dodge cause there's zero space, do you die to birds or to zappy field? )
---
And general, here's 25% "benefit" and 350% disadvantage to almost every single instability feels like bonus "fuck you pugs, go back down from t4, your life was too easy"
---
Frankly at this stage I'd take old social awkwardness with toxic trail and last laugh cause it's a less pain in the ass than some of "improved" instabilities combo :(
---
I thought i was just going crazy! Thank you so much for the info

---
Best online game community I have ever seen!

Using technology/cannons in the fight against Zhaitan isn't what people were upset about; it's how static the fight was. If the cannons were used to augment our ability to reach/fight him (similar to Teq laser), there wouldn't have been as big an issue. It's the fact that you're glued to a cannon spamming one button, and then breaking off to kill some spawned mobs, then back on the cannon that creates the appearance of a dull/rushed/lazy fight.
---
The Mordremoth fight didn't get nearly as much flak, most of the complaints I've seen are people trying to get the Migraine achievement (and it's mostly just frustrated ranting). Your point also isn't entirely correct; the fight against Mordremoth is a 2 part fight. The story instance and the Dragon's Stand meta both happen simultaneously; the idea being that a small squad attacks his mind while the main pact army attacks his body to distract him. Dragon's Stand is still an extremely popular meta, and besides the common complaints about HoT's story, there aren't really any complaints about attacking his mind aside from how players sometimes view his mind avatar as strange.
---
As long as the fight is exciting visually and fun mechanically, players will often suspend logic to enjoy the fight; it is a game after all. The last Kralk fight was enjoyable; I'd just like to see it occur in a more open space. 
---
Expect to be blown away. Figuratively and literally.

There really are people that say ele is bad in fractals? It's literally the highest dps spec in fractals + provides gigantic amounts of cleave, easy access to might and fury and great mobility with fiery greatsword. If it is about your ability to survive, once you get used to the class, you can easily survive any encounter.
---
Oh that could b nice also :O Coz i think males/females would/could hold weps different. You are on to something :D !
---
Or like in some mmo's, being able to pick that when you create a char. Same with voice.   
---
That made me think, they changed how human females stand, when standing still. It was so cute, but since the shoulders bugged ppl wasn't too happy with it :( so it got changed. They stretched their arms up above their head.  
---
What skill does this?
---
I just love how I got downvoted as hell when I said those new instas are trash and now people realized it themselves lmao.
---
Necros have cpc to destroy projectiles.
---
&gt; ... you just have to endure and waste dodges.
---
dodging to remove the birds  thus taking less dmg and no more constant blind say you are not wasting a dodge. Wasting a dodge would look something like getting hit by the boss then dodging because you just took dmg and avoiding no attacks, and mitigating no dmg, and not gaining a better/safer position.
---
&gt; The birds spawned by correctly dealing with the mechanics are an added difficulty : they waste our skill target caps, blind again (I think) and overall reduce the readability of the battlefield.
---
again "waste" the target cap is not wasted, the birds take dmg and die. They are not invul targets that can not be dmg'd but still take 0 dmg hits.
---
To add to your suggestions, making them in combat only would eliminate several frustrations with the instability.
---
Just adding on. It's hard to get new gear for different builds in t4s compared to raids due to the agony resistance problem.
---
 Hello all,
---
I am a returning player from 2013. I started a new character to relearn the game. My question is how do I level efficiently to get the most achievements and map completion as possible? If anyone can recommend a strategy I would really appreciate it. My current strategy is once I discover a new zone, I 100% complete it before moving on. I also only do the personal story missions after I have completed a map. I am currently lvl 32 and about being the lvl 30 personal story.
---
Any tips on how to get the most of my leveling process would be greatly appreciated. I am not trying to speed level, I am trying to level efficiently. Also, please advise on the best method for leveling my trade skills while I level. I have only began cooking so far to benefit from the food buffs while I level. If anyone can recommend a good 2nd trade skill for a Guardian I would appreciate that.
---
Thank you for reading,

Was that a recent guild chat?
---
Where's [Good Ol' GW 1 Pain Inverter](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Pain_Inverter) when you need it?
---
I also have seen this a lot recently for various characters.
---
I just want to be a dolphin
---
Hey, just messaged you to offer help in game, but then you went offline. Hope you got it sorted, if not feel free to message. I'm uk too.
---
TL;DR: Create dynamic shadows from 2D textures, instead of 3D models, which take longer to load.
---
The fire wyverns do not use that nearly as often partly because they have at least one more skill than the griffon. 
---
couldnt you just all /gg and afk while dead?
---
To each there own, but nothing matches it's just there. When I did "eye cancer" it actually made sense and matched. This....this is just "trying" to stand out but not in a good way.
---
xD it is xD Hmm, ya i didnt xD :D hehe "  **( •̀ω•́ )** " thats so cute :D   
---
but like pvp and wvw can get pve things, in a way. I would like to get pvp things like armor or so.. i wouldn't mind some crazy month-long quest I know its not possible and that its pvp armor so its pvp. :( XD 
---
The pug experience for Weaver mains in pugs has never been so good with one shot instabilities left and right. :D
---
Really considering either changing class or just stopping fractals altogether until they fix the broken mess they created.
---
Offtopic: Know any good EU Fractal guilds?
---
I'll admit other then the wings being unmatchedthis is old me.

Yeah, they should be deadly, but horribly imprecise. And have slowly recharging ammo or ammo that only goes up when defeating enemies.
---
It's better to avoid ammo clips. Too much hassle.
---
Hey might be harder now. Try guesting on a german server. I did this for a friend who was stuck, and the german server had a different map that wasnt bugged. 
---
I just started to play wvw a lot and it’s definitely not dead.  I mean I know it’s not as popular as it once was, but honestly I’m having a blast.  This weekend had queues on all maps which was nice.  
---
Roaming around on my ranger with friends is honestly some of the most fun I’ve had in an mmo in a while.  
---
I honestly can’t believe this amazing game mode hasn’t gotten the attention it deserves from Arenanet.....but even the way it is now, I’m still having fun 
---
Yeah there was no luck involved when opening that many.  It's a statistics game for the profits.  Basically all the festival items are the profit for the ones bought from the TP, while ones bought from other players directly/alt accounts were the most profitable portions opened.
---
Suggestions for we bleed fire?
---
It's been Anet's design decision from the beginning to treat skills like that.
---
There's much more to the skills we have, because we don't get global cooldowns, and quite a few things are instacasts. Then there's also synergy like the combo system and more niche interactions like from traits to ramp things up, making a weapon's potential much more than the sum of its skills. 
---
Ranger Longbow isn't really the best example here because of how straightforward it is (long range, single target with an emphasis on maintaining distance), but the tactical use of the stealth can still get you pretty far if you combine it with mobility skills. 
---
I haven't seen a character identical to mine yet so even though it's full of infusion I found it perfect. 
---
( sorry deepl translator)
---
Hey all! Just a reminder, Magic Find in maguuma is happen TONITE @9PM UK Time. Hope to see lots of you there!
---
If you've got a mouse that you can make custom keybinds/macros on you can make one yourself, but it has to be a macro that isn't a toggle. My keybind is a keydown, so when I hold it down it spams left click (used to use it before Consume All on loot bags existed). I still have to spam the F button myself.
---
I love ambush skill, but after hearing people tag on mirage for being braindead OP I can see why. My escapes are too successful and my damage is unstoppable.
---
I missed that comment, thanks!
---
Does anyone know an area where it's completely dark and where you can fight enemies is the dark? I know some places without lighting but there are no enemies there. And I tried the Forsaken Halls but the skels inside are invulnerable while in the dark.
---
(I want to capture some effects there to update something on the wiki, the darkness would really help to show the effects clearly)
---
I love the multiple engages and ways to play mirage, I can output lots of damage multiple ways. If chrono is more static and casting then I defitnetly want to stick with mirage.

Having to dodge to ditch Birds when your'e trying to hang onto your dodges to dodge boss mechanics is a pain in the ass.  The "gameplay" there is all to frequently deciding if you want to die to birds now, or a few seconds from now, when the otherwise unavoidable AOE attack you're saving your dodge for lands.  Bleah.
---
But....magic.
---
Everyone answered your questions.  You English is fine btw.  Wouldn’t of even known it wasn’t your native language until you said something.
---
Most of all:  HAVE FUN!!  Gw2 was very overwhelming for me coming from other games in this genre.  Most other mmos have a mapwork of what you need to do.  GW2 is very open ended and let’s you decide what you want to do; which feels weird at first lol.  This game has one of the best open worlds out there imo.  Have fun exploring!
---
I’ve personally found my niche playing WvW and starting to work towards full ascended gear has been another overwhelming (in a good way) task.
---
Good luck!!
---
You can have yearly raid wings.
---
Maybe. 
---
Well i just started playing the game. MY......BAD......
---
The complaint isn't that we used technology and skyships to kill Zhaitan. 
---
Its that Zhaitan sat there on the ledge like a soggy storm washed kitten and took it until he died.
---
You can use an autohotkey script, if you don't know how to do that just type "autohotkey" or "ahk" into the search bar of this sub.
---
An Asura-built orbital railgun maybe? At a certain point, you just don't get to just swing a sword at the thing until it dies. It's bigger than Godzilla. We could at least get to press the big candy-like red button.
---
Well, welcome back. have you watched some promo vids on YouTube for HoT and PoF? maybe watch some of those in your spare time while you level up and get familiar with the core game to get a view of the expansions
---
If you lose that bet, will you be ingame with no pants?
---
im currently on the living world season 4 episode 2 and was wondering about braham, does he stop being so damn angry? i dont even remember why he is angry at the player? 
---
for the first qustion i would prefer just a yes or no answer mostly, i dont wanna know the specifics before i get to that part myself. 
---
You make it so magic makes the bullets, and that alone, people still have to aim themselves. Well, unless they are a cheating mesmer with their cheaty homing bullets. 
---
Has the level cap increased past 80? I have an 80 elementalist with all exotic gear and a couple ascended trinkets or something? 
---
Yes, he does. As to why: play the HoT story.
---
thank you. i already played the hot story but i really dont remember anything that would make him so angry at the player
---
I'm guessing someone one burned Octovine and they had to wait a couple extra minutes for their loot.
---
Part of the reason the PvP armor is only available in PvP is because the PvPers wanted exclusive rewards like the PvErs have (raid skins, fractal skins, etc.). Thus, there are exclusive skins for each game mode.
---
Getting combat locked is my single biggest source of aggravation with GW2's design.  It's such a problem that members of my static (myself included) /gg wherever possible - to save time, sure, but mostly to save *hassle.*
---
And tries to shake you off the saddle. I love that bit SO much.😂💕
---
I swear, every attack or utility with a cast time longer than a quarter of a  second spawns them.
---
Haha you have the patience of a saint :) 
---
Hmm, did a search and looked at it, not sure what I'm looking at hahaha. Was hoping for a mouse clicker download where it can record the clicker going from point a (F to talk to Drooburt) to point b (give exotic luck), then click, then repeat forever.
---
What’s your account name?? I might have something you might be interested in.  I’ll mail it ingame....don’t worry about the suspicious link, just click it.
---
More dungeons is what we need IMO. I think the biggest issue with this **MMO** is that the developers focus too heavily on solo content (with maps that go stale fast). The issue for me is that there is a lack of *new* group play that is encouraged and we only get like 3 hours of new *solo* content about every 3 months.
---
I play MMOs to interact a lot with others, whether it's by playing against them (PvP) or with them (PvE). Thus, I believe that they should increase the replayability of new maps (promote more group events and keep it refreshing) and that they should turn the last parts of the solo story into dungeons. The latest living world had a very cool boss fight at the end and I think that it would be great as a dungeon.
---
&gt; Being able to dye underwear
---
The funny thing is that the tech for this already exists. There used to be a bug where if you broke your armor, as long as you remained on the same map, your underwear in your character preview would take on your armor's primary color.
---
In theory they should be good to go if they add an underwear tab just like they added a mount tab.
---
So?  Players who do not enjoy playing support should not be expected to play support just because they happen to have a character capable of the role.  If that were the case we'd have a lot fewer Weavers and a lot more support Tempests.
---
What are these weird glyphs in the chest ? Is it an ancient language of the Dwarves that is not yet documented by the Priory ?

/r/gatekeeping

oh that would also be nice.. I miss learning and seeing new things :D I do miss group things also :D   
---
I never said it wasn't comparable, just that it wasn't great unless you fit your burst into broken bar window.
---
As to open world, fine is really a nebulous term. Sure it's fine. So is a Minionmancer. But is it great? No. Having a crapton of cleave is much better in general.
---
It's why Deadeye is nowhere near as good as DD in open world. Sure it can't shoot at 1500, but you don't need that either.
---
I have the Unbound tool. It's actually marginally *worse* than an unskinned tool, because there's a delay before the fourth strike (standard tools have a double strike on the third visual hit, so the fourth strike is effectively a tiny bit faster). Both gather the same number of items per interaction, though, it's just a minor timing difference.
---
:O oooh i dont think i saw. I guess in a way its there for a lot of things; like gliders can be, but not backs. 
---
anytime someone in your party starts a story instance, as long as you're on their map, you can join them. If you're both following the same story, you can both get progress on it. And in general, unlike GW's hub system where you only can find other players in safe zones, the world is more like other MMOs where you can interact with other players anywhere
---
To be fair in PvE it can work as well, thieves use magic so like you ‘absorb their power’ instead of stealing a weapon.
---
For example you steal from a bear then you get bearlike weaponskills (abilities), pouncing, slashing, maul. Just an idea. 
---
You could view it as just increasing your abilties but that’s what the conjure weapons and kits are in essence as well. 
---
Again it was just a concept that popped up in my head I thought it would be interesting to see in game and share.
---
Last thing I like your idea, stealing more supportive weaponbundles to heal allies or buff them or something in that trend would be fun to see. 
---
To add on to this, once you hit a certain part in the main story it is the same no matter what race/options you choose at the beginning. 
---
Mounts would be great if they didn't *destroy the core design of GW2.* They just...threw every map conceived prior to PoF into the garbage. It's baffling to me. But sure, great implementation.
---
No both Rev F2 and Boon Overload effectively give you 20% even *past cap*. So you'd basically have 120% BD.
---
Pretty cool. Did you run into local decoration cap a lot? Been trying to make one but haven't tried these walls yet. 
---
&gt; how do you know CMs but somehow don't have any kps? just do them a few times with your usual group that you mentioned earlier!
---
Because I've done them before?  And been fine?  I didn't say I had none, I just don't have the 100+ that people seem to want because I don't do them every day.

thank god. 
---
i dont remember anything that would make him that way in hot. 
---
Sort of.  The Echoes are channeling their own attack which mirrors Siax's.  Siax's attack has the growing AoE which detonates when it fills the room.  Normally the Echoes detonate at roughly the same time, causing you to down -&gt; instant full dead from multiple simultaneous detonations (if you fail the mechanic).  
---
Siax is a champion so his attack, which the growing AoE indicates, is unaffected.  The Echoes are only veterans, so their mirrored attack is sped up.  You can see the Echoes' animations complete and detonate before Siax does because of this.  Which is why the team will take huge damage (or down) depending on how many Echoes finish channeling, but not instantly wipe as normal; Siax's half of the attack doesn't happen if you clear all 4 before the circle fills the room.  
---
The Echoes have no circles or ground indicators because they were originally timed to detonate with Siax's; there's no need to make two circles for the same attack happening at the same time.  Sugar Rush was an oversight which broke this synchronization.  
---
Every 1k luck you give drooburt, you get an achievement reward, which is a stack of 8 trash items that total for 7s4c.  So it's a conversion rate of 1k luck = 7s4c because the achievement is endlessly repeatable.  However there is a 5 time cap on achievement points so you only get 25 AP from the first 5k luck you give to Droobs.
---
Fastest I could get it to deposit to him if 1 per second. =/
---
Why no Righteous Instincts on guardian? 
---
It's pretty obvious, they are waiting for GoT to end so they can follow that story line.
---
Axe-Guuun!
---
For kids.
---
Are you asking like how to play co-op or something else I'm missing?
---
If the two of you have regular accounts and are on at the same time (and both on NA or EU) then you can message and talk and decide what to do, etc. You can group up and tackle any open world content or help with each others' personal story/living world instances.
---
If you're trying to do WvW together, then you both need to have chosen the same WvW world to be on the same side.
---
You can also party up in PvP IIRC to fight together.
---
You'll need to know his account name, it's something like name.1234, to add to your friends, etc. and if you played GW1 you probably have linked your acct and know all that from the site.
---
As far as strategy goes, there's nothing inherently wrong with doubling up on professions in content, unless you specifically are trying to do a strategy. My main is a thief, so for me it's alot easier to stealth my way through stuff rather than always fight. I can fight as well though, and 2 thieves on content can murder most open world pretty easy if you know what you're doing. That said the only real rule of GW2 is that you both should be enjoying the experiences if that's doubling up or diversifying.
---
You'll have 5 toon slots to start with, so you can always get some variety.
---
Not quite.  As commented above, some ground indicators *are* sped up by Sugar Rush, but others aren't.  I'm not sure how they're programmed for this to be the case, but in this instance it's because the Echoes themselves don't have indicators.  Their attack and Siax's attack are two separate things that were programmed to happen simultaneously, so the Echoes didn't get superfluous indicators.  They're just finishing their non-indicated attack faster due to being Veterans affected by Sugar Rush.
---
Man I miss the good old days when in movies the black guy was guaranteed to be the first to die. Now we are stuck with the diversity hire Zafirah until the end of GW2.
---
For solo PvE, any trash you are literally better off cleaving with GS auto, since it gives you a nice evasion window and is about three times better than Longbow. For some champions, sure, you can use Longbow if they are melee only, but that's a very small niche. In general you are better off dealing twice the DPS using a x/axe greatsword combo, especially since it gives you a bit more CC and better burst for breakbars, which is very very nice for champions. 
---
You are much better off trading a very small amount of DPS to run more defensive utilities coupled with stability so you can just get at the champion, break its bar and burn it down rather than plinking for two minutes. That gives it more time to kill you, adds to spawn, etc. 
---
Not sure if this is a meme, but finding a group for dungeons/fractals takes less than 2mins. 
---
Agreed. Playing as a druid/healer nowadays is just so annoying. With pretty much every instability being 'your party takes much more damage' taking care of other people health bars ...ughh. 
---
So many bloody damage modifiers everywhere, stacking on top of each other..its as if anet absolutely despises healers and just wants them all quit from frustration.
---
Same - either that or necros. 
---
I just want to add that you don't have to go through a city at all to play together.
---
As soon as you finish the tutorial instance, you'll have access to all five starting waypoints.
---
This means you can just instantly teleport to where your friend's character of a different race starts from and immediately start playing together.
---
They added this in the Free to Play update, since Lion's Arch is locked until level 35 for free to play accounts.
---
I dig the look, though I think you'd have better reception over at r/guildwarsdyejob, try posting there 👍
---
well how many do you have? at least 20? 
---
there is no real solution to your problem except: finding a guild that somehow is willing to trust you based on what you claim which is unlikely, making your own 100+ kp lfg despite not having them(lame), join low kp runs and power through, fake the kps(super lame)
---
yea it's annoying to have to run with clueless people but you could try stacking a bunch of dragonhunters to ignore mechanics..even the worst players could probably clear 100cm with enough aegis spam
---
i can kinda understand why people ask for so many because the majority of players are extremely slow learners and even 50kp runs are messy compared to the 150+ ones
---
you could also try to plead your case with people, i constantly see others getting accepted into runs without having the necessary kp as long as they don't mess up
---
Oh thx ! 
---
Spend 5 minutes in Mistlock and it'll be like standing in a hall of mirrors
---
rare.
---
I'll admit, I didn't think it was a good idea when folks were first talking about it, but it's really solid and consistently fun, even in maps that were never designed around them.
---
About the only negative I can think is that the core PoF maps designed around them are maybe a little TOO big and empty, but that's not the fault of the mount design itself.
---
&gt;Female Sylvari
---
You mean Commander Shepard?
---
new engi spec idea,you run around map harvesting trees and mining iron and making weapons from them.
---
I did it on a hammer core guardian, your not on a timer. Just run through the mechanics.
---
in the last bit be mindful of parts of the floor as it has ticking damage, having some stab and condi clear would help too. 
---
You're part of this sub Reddit, how fitting. 
---
It's funny how it's always 'everyone else' that are doing something wrong.
---
If you watch the video i have listed in the post only my characters are in the arena, i have the lobby tab open numerous times during the match which show only my characters are in the match.
---
I dont recall exactly how many rank points or reward track points it give you but it is less then a unranked or ranked match, also custom arena rewards are locked to a speficic limit, after you reach it you will not get any rewards until the next daily cycle.
---
The few times i have played custom arenas i have played 1 match to get my pvp dailies, not for rewards so i dont know what the limit is.
---
Ah I follow, yeah the personal story is different, as if you aren't the same race/choices at a point then you'll only get whatever combat XP if you help and the host will get the story progression. There's a few points in the original story where you'll both be doing the same thing, but then it loops away, and converges again near the end. After that the Living World stories won't branch so you both can do them and I believe get credit at the same time (though you'll be 80 by that point for sure).
---
In the leveling stories if you pick different races or choices yeah they'll be times where you're not both progressing the same mission.
---
Hearts on the maps are the same as they're tracked individually. You can do them at the same time, but not specifically together, like team XP, other than joining up to kill. You don't have to worry about kill stealing though as if you both put damage on a mob you'll both get XP, but on some hearts you have to pluck, encourage, burn, search, press F, etc yourself.
---
Congratulations on... whatever that is.
---
Is the built in benchmark more accurate than PresentMon?
---
I'm only asking because PresentMon outputs CSV files, which I can immediately import into spreadsheets, while the built in benchmark gives me JPGs.
---
Does anybody know how to get to the Ectoplasmic Containment point of interest in Mythwright Gambit W6 map?
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.
---
The problem from a game design perspective is "Extremely powerful but extremely inaccurate" just translates to "Roll the dice, either get lucky and kill your opponent outright or be completely useless"
---
FF12 probably has my favorite take on fantasy guns. They're completely accurate and fairly powerful, even ignoring the defense of enemies that don't specifically have a trait that defends against them, but they don't scale *at all* with your stats. So they're pretty strong early on, and they're invaluable when doing low-level runs of the game, but other weapons will eventually be better as your characters build up to being superhumanly powerful in their own right.
---
The "+incoming damage" ones are annoying for sure but at least they're only good for one or two one-shots per run. Bleed fire is telegraphed and fairly easy avoided, and slippery just forces you to be more deliberate with your movements and adapt to slightly different physics. Birds is a constant annoyance, keeps you in combat for no reason, and wastes active damage mitigation in the form of dodges, which are supposed to be a core tenet of GW2 gameplay. By forcing you to waste dodges, you're shifting the meta to require healers to compensate for the additional damage taken by not having dodges available. Dodging is one of the most interesting and fun aspects of GW2, why just throw it away?
---
At the very least Birds needs to be changed, because there are just far too many shitty mechanics to deal with at once. Leave the extra adds, make them blind you unless killed, or remove the adds and keep the birds debuff, but both at the same time is just absurd and doesn't make gameplay more entertaining at all 
---
the personal story is the story from level 1-80 (although you're given it in 10 level increments)
---
The living world story takes place after the main story, and is in between large expansion stories
---
Season 1 took place immediately after the personal story (unplayable, either read about it or watch a video)
---
Season 2 took place immediately after season 1 and leads into Heart of Thorns
---
Season 3 took place after Heart of Thorns and leads into Path of Fire
---
Season 4 is taking place now after Path of Fire and will lead into season 5
---
So the story chronology goes 
---
Personal Story-&gt;Season 1-&gt;Season 2-&gt;Heart of Thorns-&gt;Season 3-&gt;Path of Fire-&gt;Season 4-&gt;Season 5-&gt;????
---
It's the content that keeps going after the main story. Pretty much all of the following requires you to be 80 before you can start it. Basically the ongoing narrative starts at 80.
---
A benefit of the Living world/ expansion stuff is that you can also replay the content for achievments IMO.
---
Sorry about the wall of text:
---
After your personal story completes, there's the season 2 episodes (you have to purchase, but can pay with gold converted to gems if you want). There's 8 of them and they bridge kinda what happens leading into Heart of Thorns. It introduced 2 new maps, but I also believe those maps are open to F2P and base game owners.
---
HoT is the first expansion. It details our trip into the Maguuma Jungle. It introduces gliding and masteries and elite specializations. It introduced 4 new content maps.
---
Season 3 is another living world season. There's 6 epsiodes, it deals in part with the events after Hot, and leads up to Path of Fire. it brought 6 new maps.
---
PoF is the second expansion. It details our mission into Elona. It introduces mounts and a new set of elite specializations. PoF added 4 more maps.
---
We're currently in Living World Season 4. We're on episode 5, and 5 maps and an interesting persistent instance have been introduced.

If you bought a bundle, it's possible you purchased HoT/PoF already. The Living World seasons are a seperate purchase you can do at any time. I believe you can purchase whatever you're missing individually or keep an eye our for sales on the gem store. The living World Episodes are free during the window that they are the current episode, and they attach to your account just for logging in. So you should have Episode 5 associated with your acct now, even though you can't play it until you're 80. In about 2-3 months when E6 is released, if you login you'll unlock that episode as well. You only have to purchase the episodes you're missing.

The personal story is essentially the story of core GW2. It's supposed to get your familiar with the world, as well as your profession. It's also will introduce you to what they had intended for group content originally, and as you see the world, you'd see other stuff like world bosses, or jumping puzzles etc. The original idea with the LW was that as new content was added it would change the existing maps, but the devs ultimately didn't like that meaning that people would miss out on the original content, so they swapped to adding new maps with season 2. As you level or explore you'll see the wreckage changes now from season 1. You can only get a recap of that time, not play it.
---
If you're looking for lore/story, then yes the content I described above is how that continues after launch. There's multiple ways to play the game and have fun though including doing the other game modes for leveling tomes to use in PvE.
---
Still 80, but we have elite professions to level up and masteries.
---
1.00 Gold?
---
How did you fix it if I may ask?
---
&gt; Capitalism sucks
---
lol ok commie
---
Alternatively people could just not live in Europe   
---
If you really have problems surviving, then you definitely want to "waste" one utility slot for condi cleanse or other defensive cooldown. Twist of Fate is cheesy, but always good additional dodge+break stun if you're playing Weaver, blink can be helpful to dodge out of AoEs when out of dodges, and there is always good vanilla condi cleanse. Feel free to swap healing skill to the one that your party will utilize the best, "Wash the Pain Away!" is still great AoE heal if your group is struggling with sustain, Ether Renewal is decent condi cleanse, glyph is best "offensive" heal if you don't need Blast finisher.
---
Basically the best reason to bring ele is that he is able to tailor the build to encounter with little stat swapping, other than just absurd DPS with best burst.
---
yeah, that's the ugly scaled UI :)
---
State of the game: dead.
---
Where it's heading: nowhere.
---
That’s not true.  I have more fun running around with 5 or less than following a commander in a Zerg group.  Both have places in wvw 
---
Looks like there will be lots of thieves and mesmers, which are boring duels to watch. 
---
Awesome. Play them. 
---
can you somehow change the order of the accounts manually? there are some sorting options but i dont get the order i want
---
and then I got flashback to two characters on RWBY using axe-guns... well they are actually an axe-rifle and an axe-blunderbuss... But then they have gun-nunchakus and... well everything is a gun there.
---
I mean I did Fractals with birds yesterday as a Firebrand healer and we didnt have any problems with birds 
---
[removed]
---
Anet is garbage. 
---
ANet did say we haven't gotten all the mounts for the game yet.
---
A WvW-specific mount, like a supply-carrying, gate-headbutting Yak could be pretty durn spiffy. :D
---
Wish to fuck we could get another trial/test period for Repair Hammers. Those were amazing!
---
What other guy said. However, every time you do 8 **unique** dungeon paths, you get 150 extra tokens for whichever dungeon you choose and 5 gold, so you might want to add 4 random paths every time you do all 4 arah paths.
---
Yes, they know what horses are but horses are mythological in Tyria iirc. Maybe horses are from the place that humans originally came from before the gods brought them to Tyria.
---
Ok, so when you get the rewards for doing the custom arena match, do you get the rewards for one player or three players?  If I spent the same amount of time in a custom match, with my one character would we be getting the same reward, or would you be getting 3 times the reward as the solo player in this example?
---
I kindof started to like skimmer in sandswept isles. You have to dodge random sea animal :O
---
Not if you do it right.
---
In other more classical RPG games, "less accurate" means a lower calculated chance to hit, but in more action oriented games like shooters it means that the bullets tend to stray more from the aimed target.  
---
GW2 is more action-oriented. We hardly have any random values unless it's part of the behavior of a skill like meteors falling in seemingly random spots in the area, and we hardly have chances to proc. We just have a few remnants of old those designs, like precision and chances for projectile combos, but they if you look at updates over the years, they tend to move away from those.
---
Done right, it means that it's dangerous the closer you get and the less you move. "Spray &amp; Pray" doesn't need as much praying when you are point blank. That, translated to GW2, would mean that a thief trying to fire at you with unload would be more accurate when they are closer and when they are not moving, thus the more dangerous it is for them, the more it pays for them to do it, creating the beauty of risk vs high. 
---
Then you have weapons like sniper rifles that must be both accurate and precise, with those what you trade isn't precision with distance, but awareness and movement. When one is looking through the weapon's scope, they can't see everything around them as easily, and they are forced to rely on ally support and hearing, and moving makes aiming much worse.   
---
In GW2, while it be kind of cool to have a scope view in first person, many players prefer to have the camera zoomed out. There's the alternative of having part of the world around the character turn dark or even pitch black while aiming. There's other alternate tradeoffs, like taking longer to aim, or taking longer between shots, but they are usually less fun that being able to fire away. 
---
There's other variables to trade too. Like ammo clip size, reload time, firing rate...
---
In GW2 we cannot have ammo clips, as it'll mean having to add more design points in PvP arenas to place them, and dealing with extra objects like ammo drops from enemies, but we do have skill ammo.  
---
The more powerful a projectile weapon is meant to be, the less ammo it would have, or the longer it would take to recharge ammo. Take, for instance, engineer Mortar. Not the worst skill, but still kind of meh for an elite. Change it to have 4 ammo, 6 ammo when equipped with a trait, and a recharge of 10-20s for the ammo, or  having the full ammo recharge every 10-20s whether it was used or not, and the skills can be empowered to have greater effects in turn, even lose their recharges of have them greatly reduced. 
---
One thing that always bothers me about firing Unload repeatedly is that it lacks the satisfying rhythm of a reload after a fixed number of shots.
---
Precision is kind of out of place in GW2 because of that, if you think about it.  
---
To have random ranges of damage and add variability, we already have ranges in Power in weapons. 
---
They should consider replacing precision with a more action-oriented attribute that doesn't rely in statistics. Like having base attack speed slightly reduced, but then replacing Precision with a new stat called Agility that increases attack speed in the same ammount that would make people with precision get more or less the same average damage., along changed traits thaits and weapon skills that deal the critical hits based on positioning, opportunity and/or rhythm.

[Living Story Season 3](#s "That is for sure the reason, also should be mentioned that Braham's idea in episode 3 was to take the scroll he got and chip off Jormag's tooth so he could rally the Norn to go fight the dragon. The Commander doesn't like this idea since it was reckless and would get people killed. Braham is mad at our plan and storms off on his own. We also basically tell him he isn't allowed to kill any dragons later since it would offset the balance")
---
Go complete hearts and find events together. Follow each other and collect waypoints, vistas and point of interests.
---
Fight world bosses when it’s time and do dungeons together.
---
Level up together and every 10 levels, you get personal story progress to complete.
---
If you choose different races, it can take a while before your stories match up. Then you can both do the story together.
---
wait, you're running druid with firebrand+renegade? Now that's what I call overkill.
---
Other stuff aside, I do agree the skills aren't the prettiest, in fact if it's a big zerg it's mainly a big spam of explosions with no discernible individual elements going on.  I refuse to defend gw2 on fighting effects, they are sub par compared to other games I've seen.
---
As you get into the late/end game weapons that's when you start to see the cool weapon effects.  Hang around in lions arch and watch the higher level players kicking about to see.
---
The skills themselves though are changed by the weapons you are using, of which there is a wide variety and possible combinations.
---
the power of christ compels you! 
---
Also get the black lion goods chest on login days 4, 11, 18, and 25.
---
Hey yes I saw a player with the Greatsword "twilight" in Ascalon near the black citadel and the effects were pretty f_ing cool lol 
---
Following that logic we should be able to also craft exquisite serpentite jewels.
---
what a dumb fucking post
---
The distinction is they come in a setting already, less that it's a expac stat. 
---
:)
---
Just keep your inventory open and dragged to the side.
---
you are right, having to press dodge once in a while is far more taxing than getting 1shot by some random trash mob because you were facing the wrong way
---
how can you say fire is easy to avoid but then on the next sentence you say birds waste dodges? does fire not waste dodges too? i know you can block or reflect but most of the time you do have to dodge those too..plus if the fight has adds good luck avoiding all of the procs
---
slippery is slightly different physics?? if you use any form of movement ability you fly off the map..if you get knocked back somehow you get thrown halfway across the map
---
do you genuinely believe what you say or are you just trying to make a case because you don't like birds? i don't like them either, i don't like any instability honestly but they are a joke compared to everything else
