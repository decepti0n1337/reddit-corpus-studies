Being proud of something that isn't widely accepted as a normal thing doesn't hold a lot of weight either.
---
---
---
That's why they are doing this kind of events.
---
Disclaimer: I'm a straight white male.

---
This whole 'straight pride' thing just strikes me as whining. It's like if you get cake every day of your life, but complain the one time someone else gets cake and you didn't. I find it to be incredibly insulting actually. I take pride in what I've accomplished or adversity I've overcome, telling me I should be proud of being straight is like telling me I should be proud of having eyeballs. Why? What about the shit I've actually done and actually overcome. I don't need to shit on someone else's cake in order to feel good about myself.
---
Go to any bank, there's a wardrobe tab with (almost) every skin in the game for you to preview.
---
OP stated they does not have any expansions (yet), core guard in a zerg is sufficient enough in the right hands but you need to play it safe. While I am aware FB is miles better (and OP should defs get the xpacs if he is serious about WvW), no one can deny the usefulness of SYG + traited stab on F3 let alone the boons provided anyway, all of which are built into the core design of guardian to begin with.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I hope you aren't implying OP simply shouldn't bother playing WvW if he doesn't have expansions for elite specs. WvW can be fun even with core classes.
---
Granted, I've had years of experience which might not be mimic'd by a new player, regardless, having played full clerics core guard on alt accounts and have done just fine in all out zerg settings, the only problem being low HP prone to spike/bomb dmg.
---
I mean just pick almost any story from anywhere? Every action movie, comic novel, tv series etc. always represent straight people as the main characters where any LBGT+ at best become a side character. As a gay person myself I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm too bothered by it but the fact that some straight people like yourself demand equality for a society that represents you literally eveywhere by default, you really make my blood boil. It‚Äôs a parade in a video game, so let‚Äôs not make a bigger deal then it has to be jeez
---
Oh ok ty! And I guess there will be weapons too?
---
Can you make light armor look like heavy or no?
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs doing an /s moment bud
---
Ok this is the info i've been needing. I really like that discussions of this game go to the fraction of a percent like this and have concrete numbers to back it up. Im still new to group content and though I know most groups are "full glass cannon" and rely on supports to stay alive and boonswozzled, the fact that this is so violently *not* the case in solo content is what's had me wondering. Thank you!
---
Brighton?
---
Just dropping by to say that I feel bummed too. Invisible walls suck, especially on places that were previously available for years, or some random ledges that look like you can totally land on.. But you can't. \o/
---
You can, but I would highly recommend acro trait line for the one trait that gives "evade" or invul I forget the name since there's an abundance of one shot builds out there, mirage, sbeast, holo chain cc are real pains if you get hit by their burst.
---
Another thing worth mentioning is fighting near enemy objectives one of the more recent changes people seem to forget is you cannot stay in stealth as long since sentries/tiered up objectives apply reveal on you if so.... yeah.
---
Good luck.
---
Do gay people typically demand that you let them fuck you in the ass?
---
Well we can celebrate for being straight too right?
---
All colours of the rainbow
---
Yes, weapons are there too! You can't use an armor skin outside your profession's weight class, but there are a few sets here and there that look like a different weight. Just browse through and you'll see.
---
Its so fucking stupid to exclude straight people
---
The thing is, you need to balance it.
---
You can't appeal to *only* hardcore players.
---
Besides the Hunting Grounds all the hearts are pretty quick, also plenty of nodes to gather along the way
---
Officially? Or assuming they'll return?
---
Yes
---
Just don't run core guard as a replacement for FB, that's all I'm saying. Run core ele, it's almost as good as weaver for staff dps with fire/air/arcane, and it fits the exact same role. Obviously it's damage is slightly lower, but it's really not that significant. If you want to roam, run core ranger/thief/warrior/guardian. Literally all I said is that core guard is not a good replacement for Firebrand in the support role.
---
That's already in game dude. Embers and destroyers are immune to burning. Ember bay Destroyers are vulnerable while chilled.
---
As it pertains to LGBTQ pride you are on the money. The word has a much longer history and many more uses than just referring to LGBTQ people/pride.
---
Honestly it‚Äôs hard to understand if he‚Äôs saying that he doesn‚Äôt care about *people being gay* or *me being gay*. [I think this might answer the latter part of your comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/c4dmhj/todays_lfg_made_me_smile/erw6va9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ios_share_flow_optimization&amp;utm_term=control_2)
---
Then straight people should stop treating queer folk like a footnote in literally every aspect of life. Queer folk get excluded every day, pride is a way to feel happy and have an event where they are celebrated instead of being put down, bullied, systematically discriminated against, etc. Straight and cisgender people do not experience this to the level queer folk do, so it makes perfect sense to have a pride parade for them. No one is EXCLUDING straight folk from the pride parade. Allies and straight folk are free to join in. Making a straight pride parade is rubbing shit in the face of the effort and history of the queer community over the last century. That's what this is about.
---
I feel like it's just a joke because the whole lfg was filled by the pride stuff, and everyone's reaction is like "Wow how could they do this, screw those people".   Just seems kind of mean spirited with all the pushback
---
That's at least mechanic to do. Not even saying that they could implement another 2 tank mechanic, INSTEAD of stationary boss. Not even talking about this toughness target practice. Can they already stop that? Desmina is great in this aspect. You can connect mechanics to where boss is. You can make his movements to be important part of fight, like "Boss leave aoe under itself after X secs, anyone who stays there get Power buff, including enemies. Boss reflects attacks from &gt;600 range", target player with top dps. That's as example
---
Also, about helpfully. Air Djinn coded the way that's torment hits him like prefixed Cairn. I.e. shittons of damage from it.
---
Russia persecutes people for being queer with government punishment. Even if they didn't , no one is going to fucking run around and demand you let them fuck you in the ass. What a moronic argument
---
I always sunk the ship by hitting it, after a long time doing that with all my characters I found out the correct way to do it, the way it was intended, with the trebuchet.
---
Sometimes, when I do that part of the story with a new character, I swim to the ship to sink it, for old times sake
---
Yeah, and I want immunities removed and resistances added **everywhere**.
---
The whining by straight people who don't understand queer history or struggle here is real.üçø
---
GaMeS ArE SupPoSed To bE FuN, nOt a ChOrE.

You dont have to be hardcore to do HoT though.
---
Really? That's a thing?
---
‚ÄúA joke because it was filled with pride stuff‚Äù... soooo he created a straight pride out of spite of the lgbtq pride, correct? Joke or not, reasoning be whatever, people need to get over themselves. I will not be taking any of it this pride month and I will correct and call out any rude behaviour towards it.
---
I think they're saying they just aren't particularly bothered by the people who put that post and aren't offended by it
---
I ll second this.
---
Although a i5 9600K might still be the best option for GW2.
---
As for the rest:
---
16GB RAM and a SSD with at least 250GB. For a storage drive you can use your old one or get a cheap WD with a few TB of storage.
---
GTX 1660Ti is a great graphics card for the price and the RTX ones are not worth the extra money, especially not for GW2.
---
Prebuilt PCs can be really bad and contain the cheapest components available. I suggest finding a store that will build one for you with those specs with faster/better/quieter components such as RAM, PSU, CPU fan, case... They can even OC your CPU giving you even more performance in GW2.
---
Why even leave the bottom one in the screenshot
---
Oh wow Shirokuma Cafe to make this meme, i like.
---
Because most of it wasn't instanced content. It just happened out in the open world. GW2's original "living world" had content updates like every 2 weeks and if you missed it, you missed it. They later decided it was no longer a realistic model to go by and went with episodic content starting with S2.
---
But... If by your opinion we are equal, why we can't have pride day as well? BSOD.
---
Well if you want to feel like no one is allowed to make a joke about certain things without being a terrible person you're free to do so but I think that's wrong and that you're the one being close minded here, personally. 
---
  I realize that probably makes you think I am one of those people but I know I'm not so it's fine.
---
A lot of casual player (of which GW2 is full of) dislike HoT and struggle with the content.
---
That makes me think of the Fractal Armor fan art PeterPrime posted on here years ago.

---
You 100% are one of those people, take care
---
You too
---
There's cm's. How much harder do you want them to be? I raid nightly, but why do some of you want this game to be like wildstar. GW2 is NOT a hardcore raiding game. What part of that don't you guys get?
---
that's hardly a "it's too hardcore" issue.
---
&lt;3
---
I‚Äôd have to problem doing so if they hosted their parade on their own scheduel instead of hosting it ***in spite of*** pride parade. It‚Äôs piggybacking and undermining a parade, while not actually making any progress on their own. [I wrote a detailed comment below if you want a read](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/c4dmhj/todays_lfg_made_me_smile/erw6va9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ios_share_flow_optimization&amp;utm_term=control_2)
---
The straight thing is happening In August, the breeders can have August so hot in the states they won‚Äôt want to walk hahaha
---
Yes it the straight want June they can‚Äôt have it! They want August so they can take it!
---
Please don't continue your legacy, thanks.
---
I don't believe i will ever say this, but i wanna church to wipe this out of history for good. 
---
On the side note. If you try to get job in western countries and you have competitor - you gonna say "i'm gay and i will sue you for getting my right  infringed" and .. that's not how it should work. If we are going that way no one should care your sexuality. You shouldn't even mentions it. But no. If movie doesn't have LGBT character/actress in it - this movie gonna be flamed. It's doesn't even matter how good thia actress is (Captain Marvel is great example of it. Her play is terrible, but she is part of LGBT, so yes). Same goes for games. That's not how it should work.
---
Oh right. Essentially back then anet used to do temporary patches which served up the living world content. The intent was that it would only be available for a month or so then disappear forever. 
---
The story journal did not exist then, and the patches became bigger and bigger, requiring zergs and big group content.
---
After season 1 they changed to a story journal system that you know now.
---
Unfortunately, because of the nature of how the season 1 comment was made and removed, as well as it's need for group play, it was never retroactively fitted into the story journal.
---
Now the game is many years older, so reworking the old content back in would be a mammoth effort! (There were many engine changes since then!)
---
They want to hold it in August so what‚Äôs the big deal gay pride is June
---
Yeah, we need to indulge Joe by giving him full set of content on a difficulty setting he is going to be comfortable with (a.k.a very, VERY low), so he wouldn't even feel the need to become a  better, more dedicated player. Checkmate, atheists!
---
Inb4 lower rewards, no, rewards don't mean much in the game, 80% can be distilled to gold, 18 more % to other farmable currencies and 100% of them compete with ever increasing pool of other "horizontal" stuff.
---
Yeah I got under DR during one of the festivals and swam around watching people above.
---
&gt; Maybe someday we won't need events like this because people will just accept people.
---
That would be great, yeah, but as evidenced by some reactions to those events, we're not there yet :(
---
Stupid question, have you tried updating Arcdps lately?
---
Standing up against uneducated people bothers me 0%. Obviously your intent isn‚Äôt too ‚Äúseek to offend or disrespect‚Äù but that doesn‚Äôt mean that that is not what you are doing.
---
It's all about adapting, eventually you get used to it if you pay attention to what's going on. 
---
Majority of HoT was designed for groups anyway so you could do most of it the same way you do anything in Tyria - with TV on, slapping random buttons on your keyboard. All you needed were a few people from lfg, but back then there were no population issues at all.
---
There was literally a straight pride parade planned in Boston that made major headlines recently. So your argument is terrible/incorrect right off the bat.
---
To actually address things (and perhaps clarify my previous comment which you didn‚Äôt understand), straight people are celebrated by default in literally almost every aspect of culture. The male/female leads get together in almost every movie/book/what have you. 
---
LGBTQ people are rarely featured/celebrate in such a light, and many people such as yourself want to deny their very existence/rights, hence the pride and parades. 
---
Base on your other comments, wanting ‚Äúthe church‚Äù to ‚Äúburn‚Äù LGBTQ people, you should read more religious texts. God calls for Christians to love everyone, and by not doing so you have sentenced yourself to damnation. Enjoy the afterlife üòè
---
Yes. I follow televised modern queer history, newspapers, etc and read about it in the local library.
---
So I have a question about the skyscale. I'm doing day 7 the lost skyscale achievement, and i was doing the last achievement. I was closeby but didn't want to do it, so i used the treat... and did not interact with skyscale.. somehow I thought it would go on its own. So i didn't get the achievement, but I also didn't get it after slaying the ley-line anomaly anyway.
---
...I bit the bullet and bought another treat, but the entire achievement thingy is gone now and the treats say there is nothing there. I found the original place where I used the item.. aand the skyscale is also not there. 
---
sorry for the novel, buuuut I'm not sure what I should do now. Since the achievement is also completely gone from the map.
---
Oh wow Who hosted this? Beautiful day and beautiful people! ü•∞
---
I used to do this, until it wore through the finish of the desk. Now I have a mousepad made from leather. 
---
It works surprisingly well.
---
Just renamed the .dll file to .old - this will prevent arc loading.  Go into those big group events if it‚Äôs still crashing - it‚Äôs not arc .   Remember you have to download all the dll‚Äôs / files for arc to work optimally.   As you are crashing in big group events - I find it highly likely that it‚Äôs something else such : such as running on a Windows 32 bit OS ?  (The client works best on a 64 bit OS/64 bit client version of GW2).
---
Did you try removing ArcDPS and checking if you still get crashes?
---
Ok and I support you doing that against people who actually want to harm or belittle people, but the fact you see that I'm not doing that and still say I'm a terrible person is what would make me say maybe take a small step back first before you do that.
---
Hey, did you ever get this fixed? Arc is also crashing a lot for me, giving me the message that I should check my add-ons and overlays. But the only overlays I use are YoloMouse and Discord (which I turned off since I thought that was the problem at first).
---
People don‚Äôt only have to ‚Äúharm or belittle‚Äù in order to be educated. Also please show me where I personally called you a terrible person. I said that people who make jokes against the LGBTQ community are terrible people.
---
It's not a black or white thing though. Being straight is just a neutral thing for me, neither something to be proud or ashamed of, it's just who I am. In a perfect world, there wouldn't be Gay Pride, as it would also just be a neutral thing, no different than the color of your eyes. Gay Pride is a thing though, because the world isn't perfect, and people have to face hardship and adversity because of it. The pride is in overcoming, of standing strong in the face of that adversity. I haven't faced that adversity being straight, thus I don't have some kind of pride for it, it just is. I'm proud of plenty of other things though, other challenges I've overcome in life. Claiming pride in being straight doesn't only detract from the pride others have in facing and prevailing against bigotry, but also from my own accomplishments as well.
---
if it ever comes up again especially on SALE, I would almost put down the infinite pass to Mistlock Sanctuary as an essential QoL item. it lets you teleport to a mini lions arch with a few extra amenities related to fractals. getting to your usual services such as banks and crafting stations is easier and the best part, you can leave the sanctuary and be teleported back to the same exact spot you teleported from before in open world, making it one of the ultimate adventurers compendium, imo making expensive items like the infinite bank service items only attainable through horrible lootboxes nearly moot.
---
Did you check the achievement menu? You probably finished it and need to wait for Gorrik's mail.
---
I don‚Äôt think you understood my comment. We‚Äôre not celebrating over a choice you never made. We‚Äôre celebrating the people who would otherwise be shunned for a choice they never made. I‚Äôm not sure why that is a hard concept to understand. Have you known people who has been killed, assaulted, bullied or fired because they happend to be hetereosexual? Do you know how the fuck it feels to always have to hide a part of you to your family and friends? Or perhaps you know how it feels to be bullied because of something you never chose simply because people long ago decided that vermins are above you? No.
---
Usually I don‚Äôt like getting heated in debates of any kind but just the sheer amount of ignorance in your comment truly makes my blood boil. We‚Äôre a minority that‚Äôs still hurting in the west and ***fucking dying*** in the east. Do you understand that, people are dying over this and you want to debate how the minority has coined a word, which they actually haven‚Äôt? I just can‚Äôt bro, I really *really* can‚Äôt with you.
---
Nah man, those are hedge trimmers.
---
You can. It's 200 bucks, go to new Orleans and get a permit or shut the fuck up.
---
You asked me to show you where you called me a terrible person which I would except you deleted the comment.  You're saying you 100% stand by something you erased and just contradicting yourself, so I'm not going to squabble about it with you any more.
---
Ignorance? You mean like full essays explaining why there can only be gay pride but not straight pride?
---
But you basically posted ‚ÄúWorks fine for me‚Äù on a post asking for help.
---
All of my points have gone far over you‚Äôre head it appears. I‚Äôm cool for no longer squabbling about it, cheers
---
Working on it. It takes a while when I average maybe 1-2 hours a week in WvW. Not to mention that it requires PoF IIRC. I have PoF, but not everyone does.
---
Did you even read what I wrote? I think you mixed up comments, because it sounds like you are answering to a completely different comment.
---
My build is currently zerg focused. I know I could respec to a roamer, but that seems like homework I have to do to play in a zerg, whereas pre-warclaw I could just play in a zerg.
---
I don't get enough WvW time to get to T6. If I did, I would probably have a warclaw by now.
---
Are you just using Arc? No radial, or reshade, etc?
---
If not, then yes, the first thing to test is to remove / rename it and see if crashes still happen.
---
For a while I said that W7 was taking so long that W8 would be released first :/
---
I did try relogging. Nothing appeared. [This is what I see right now](https://imgur.com/gallery/od2eb6E). And I relogged as well. treat says nothing is there.
---
Even if you didn't, you can get all the stuff you need with almost no effort. You only have to grind, if you *want* to grind.
---
Well in 2019 we can safely say that being lgbt is kind of begining of normalizing it no? :p
---
I just hope in future your community wont slander us just because we are "white straight male" kind of bullshit and that we dont understand it, believe me, we do.
---
We just dont like it being pushed down in our throats and then feel like we are the ones guilty. Its not, its your life decision.
---
Also i remember some people litelary defining themselves as their sexuality (talking about the loud lgbt community, that gives bad name to you), making me even wonder if i can talk to them about anything else other than their sexuality or opression. Its like their personality was built around the idea of pride
---
Im honestly scared of those people. Im not even sure if I can talk to a gay person without feeling like ill hurt their feelings
---
Gather the nodes -&gt; you need ~75 less now.
---
That's true in general, but often harder than it seems. Did that player cheat, or just finesse a jump with the bunny/griffon? Are they speed hacking or just using some combination of stats/buffs that we haven't considered.
---
There have been (alleged) cases in the past where the cheat detecting code flagged someone innocently using their mount to go between harvest nodes as cheating.
---
Now they could have better ways to "record" (ie. log stats, buffs, actions) what happened leading up to it, and then put more effort into manual reviews and giving alleged cheaters a chance to explain how they did it instead of "they must have cheated".
---
Thanks everyone! Life got in the way a bit so I haven't logged in on here for a while
---
So I watched the videos and it makes more sense now (what bunker is, player roles etc). Now I know I shouldn't follow the guys to capture a point together so it goes faster -\_-  Oops!
---
I did a few custom arenas but it's boring as. I dueled a few times as a reaper vs a guardian, I lost with a bang but I learned stuff about the build and the guardians in general. Reaper fells better than a scourge but I know it's not the best choice for PvP. I also tried Power Guardian (core) and I quite like it. I'll check the soulbeast suggestion even though it feels cheesy (I have a SB with a similar build for PVE)
---
Didn't even know there's an option to "Appear offline &amp; Turn off chat!", thanks! Hope I won't have to use it but it's nice to have!
---
Thanks again, I'll join a game again these days and hope it goes better (and I suck less) ! :D
---
This is typical of recent Anet:
---
Sword gets created for a charr themed weapon set.  Later shows up in a dungeon puzzle where it makes sense because you're putting it into the hands of a charr statue.
---
Six years later it's suddenly an Ascalonian sword because "wait, lol, there's non-human races in this game?"
---
Better than wasting support's time ;)
---
I think it was several guilds hosting it
---
*You* would. The thing is that others wouldn't.
---
firebrand, or staff ele, rifle engineer with flame thrower, probably missed something
---
Condi berserker (warrior HoT elite specialization) using sword/torch should be pretty close to what you're looking for.
---
First, stop using Arc for an extended period and see if this even does anything for your situation. Uninstall it. Assess the results and report back here.
---
Remember correlation does not imply causation.
---
I came here specifically looking for this comment!
---
stop using arcdps?
---
Guardian has a lot of fire-based abilities and is probably the closest to what you're asking. They're closer to a Paladin in aesthetic but they can be decked out in any heavy armor to get a fiery warrior look. They're very low health but a lot of defensive abilities they can use, and a lot of their DPS skills use burning in a 'smite the wicked' sort of way.
---
Berserker (Warrior) also has a bit of fire based stuff, but not nearly to the same extent, and it's only really used in their elite spec (subclass) which gives them the ability to wield torches if desired.
---
Elementalist is a light armor mage class that also uses a lot of fire and has the flashiest fire effects. They can be built for melee as well as range and with the right sort of look you could pull off fire warrior. However, I kinda get the feeling they're not what you're looking for as they feel far more like a traditional glass cannon caster than a brawler.
---
Everything burns if you use a guardian ... but "fire damage" doesn't exist in this game.
---
Hahahahaha you just convinced me!
---
[removed]
---
And talking about skins, how hard is to get good skins? Is it normal like from weeks to few months of playing or is it insane like 6months up to 3 years haha?
---
Equality equality equality... straight ? Get the fuck out. Apparently only gats can be proud for their sexuality... Time to go back to my basement...
---
Ive heard so much about how bad the Flamethrower is but I cant help but love it. I SET CREATURES MADE OF FIRE ON FIRE WITH SCIENCE!!!!
---
That's not true at all. This is a really really ignorant take. Saying "we want a straight pride" is taking away from the struggles and oppression that those in the LGBT+ community face. Straight people don't face hassassment for being straight. They aren't killed, fired, discriminated against for being straight. 
---
The LGBT+ community doesn't hate straight people and they aren't looked down upon. Only straight people who hate LGBT+ people and act maliciously towards them and actively try to prevent them from having rights are hated by the community. If you are not that person, then you are not hated and that anger isn't directed at you. Don't take it personally. 
---
It's not X'd out because we hate straight people. It's X'd out because straight pride doesn't need to exist and is purely a tactic to take away the hard work that the LGBT+  community puts in to be treated equally in this world. The focus of pride is to highlight the community and to say "hey! We exist and we deserve equal rights!" straight people already have it. They don't need to fight for it.
---
Maybe we could... I don't know, keep *politics* away from video-games?
---
Depends on your definition of good skin and how fast you farm gold or complete collections. It could literally range from 10 seconds of crafting to months of grinding raids/endgame dungeons (we call them fractals of the mist in gw2)/pvp/wvw (realm vs realm).
---
I don't see Karsmeer and Marjory.
---
Tell their story
---
AVIATION
---
If W5 were released now, people would complete it much faster -- defensive comps are better understood than they even were in W5, as well as simply having better off-druid healer options available.  It's been pointed out, but a lot of those first clears while figuring out mechanics were using very safe builds to do it.
---
You can't compare to WoW at all, because people need to grind new gear there.  Put everyone in GW2 in rares whenever a new raid wing comes out, and it will probably take longer to get first kills.
---
But they‚Äôre not, and never will be, so you don‚Äôt actually have a point. Gay people didn‚Äôt choose to be gay, just like I didn‚Äôt choose to be straight.
---
Homophobia sure is
---
It is a joke not a dick. Don't take it so hard people jesus.
---
DEATH IS IN THE AIR
---
SUDDENLY APPEARS, CONFIRMING ALL YOUR FEARS
---
&gt; Being gay and proud is to tell those who hurt, fire, assault and murder people because of their sexuality won‚Äôt kill our spirit.
---
Oh, reaaaally? See those dark brown countires? https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/World_laws_pertaining_to_homosexual_relationships_and_expression.svg Come to one of them and show your pride there, outside of a safespace where are you more likely to get repressed saying something *against* all these kinds of you-know-what you are celebrating.

Qadim 2 is a lot simpler than Qadim 1. Especially since the dps checks are so low you can literally ignore the tether chaining mechanic and only have kiters and the tank use their special action (this is true in low DPS training groups, not just "my static is good")
---
Charged skills were in the beta, Churning Earth was one. Super Armor is basically just asking for attacks that grant stability, which is also a smarter way than breakbars to implement CC immunity on players. We've got traits that change skills in Lingering Curse, Harbinger of Sorrow, and Glacial Heart. If we're adding new classes I'd much rather have *new* classes than more "DAE PLAY GUILD WARS 1".
---
those 2 addons are not compatible with eachother.
---
You can go for Power Chrono, which works quite nice for everything you want to do and even uses the greatsword. Power Mirage works as well and is especially nice for metas where you want to tag many mobs, because of the Greatsword ambush skill.
---
Kiters on pylons, special action key tethers them. Pylons without babysitter eventually go red and must be CC'd again. Every 5% an orb spawns, kiters go left of their pylon to catch it (teleports with returns make this easy!). Once orbs are caught, stack DPS players can activate SAK to link to kiter and get a DPS boost.
---
Tank is based on whoever activates SAK nearest boss, once the tank is chosen others can activate SAK without interfering unless tank breaks tether.
---
80% and 60%, players fly around with fire, don't drop it on anything important. Pylons must be CC'd and reclaimed before the fight begins again.
---
75% adds start to spawn. CC them and kill before they get to pylons.
---
40%, 30%, 20% Qadim eats pylons. Those kiters rejoin stack group. Dodge shockwave attack.
---
20% Qadim gets boons, don't blow yourself up on retaliation. Prevent adds from reaching Qadim.
---
I think I was confusing T6 participation with the skirmish reward track (I think I barely got out of wood once). I have mostly ignored the participation tiers. Thanks for your helpful advice.
---
Please don‚Äôt generalize and say that all straight people put LGBTQ members in the margins, there are at least a few of us out here who try and accept people for what they want without even paying attention to their sexuality. The only people I find insufferable are people who make their sexuality their entire personality, anyone who‚Äôs just low key gay or anything is totally cool
---
Well I agree with certain parts of what you say but it's about balance. I'm not saying they should be  a cakewalk - w1-3 are perfect in terms of difficulty for gw2 I think. But, I don't think cranking up the difficulty to supreme levels is the answer. The problem is , it seems GW2 is either limited by it's engine or ANET are out of creativity. The recent wing borrows heavily from previous bosses...even fractals.
---
I'm not sure the community is dying and I wouldn't put it down to people finding the content too easy. It's a LOT to do with the hardcore members being intolerant to new raiders and kicking anyone who doesn't come up to their standards. I actually saw a pug looking for people for w7 qadim must have 20kp. The most u can even get is 10!!!! And this wasn't a troll post! So making the content even HARDER would exclude so many more players because people like the above would be even more stringent in their requirements.
---
As regards people having nothing to do? Well dude I've been running raids since the first day and I still clear w1 every week and full clears if I have time. I do think that the AMOUNT of content is small. I think more wings with the current level of difficulty is better than one wing with extra hard cm's.
---
Use a cheat program.
---
If you enjoy the lore and the story is important for you, buy all living story you dont have already. I think is the most important part of this game. When you have it you can buy inventory shared or all utilities you think can improve your gameplay. 
---
Dont buy gathering tools. Isnt worth!
---
Pretty much this. Also: in August there will be Birthday sales
---
Just to clarify for OP, it will only show dps (and other things) for players in your party/squad and that are in range for all the numbers to be tracked. Players not in your party afaik can not be tracked in anyway.
---
You're RPing way too hard when there's absolute no need to RP.
---
Since you bought the expansion, you should have a free slot. Create a toon and go to the pvp lobby and practice on the golems. In pvp, the elite soecializations are automatically unlocked so you can play around and experiment on traits/weapons. You xan then decide which class you like.
---
On the instalvl 80, i would advice using it on a class that it slow to level
---
&gt; The only people I personally find insufferable are people who make their sexuality their entire personality

Do elaborate, how does one do that?

You didn‚Äôt happen to catch the names of the person listing that last one? I wanna add em to my block list.
---
Noice

I dunno know. I kinda liked it lol.
---
And that OP doesn't want that Peace Treaty, no matter, he'll find a batallion of Charr in front of his Door the next morning! #ForThePeaceTreaty!
---
Loss of damage, no need for additional CC.
---
same
---
I disagree. I think the game should tell u to read your tooltips, force you to understand what boons and conditions do and teach you how traits work and how to swap them based on situation. Because you know, thats what games usually do, they lead you through difficulty curve to the end game. I don't think you should be able to level from 1 to 80 by pressing 1 ability.
---
No, it's good to leave it in. Shows you how hypocritical and intolerant anh humorless these people really are.
---
you'll get the best conversion rates when there is nothing new on the gem store and all the most popular items aren't in rotation.
---
I don't think it's loss of damage.
---
Personal dps in 61 is an issue, we're talking about 50-70k dps here, if you think a bane signet on 5man in your party is worth loosing out on 10k dps thats not going to work.
---
Same reason you don't bring bannerslaves, their buffs don't justify their lack of dps.
---
Right now is actually pretty good. Two weeks ago would have been better but it is only 1 or 2g more per 100 gems.
---
If Tuesday's patch brings new gemstore stuff then it will probably spike upwards ...

They certainly don't trigger on epic-objects (e.g. tequatl) and I don't think they trigger if your target doesn't move (much like your static centaur boss).
---
That being said, if there are adds you can pull into the traps with your spear you can trigger the traps.
---
I‚Äôm definitely going to play it - and probably with my sylvari at one point - unfortunately I have a special interest in a certain character, which means the end of Act One is gonna screw me over. So...I‚Äôll have to come up with some plans.
---
CM: don't stand in bad or get hit by lightning. During the REALLY BIG REALLY OBVIOUS attack where the whole arena is red except one spot, stand in the one spot.
---
You can solo orb with any leap / mobility skill. Did it on dgh with wings of resolve. Also kiters should probably be scourge or deadeye anyway for their immortality traits.
---
Who cares about the specific timer of the add? It gives a huge reactable AN ADD IS SPAWNING visual tell. Zero coordination needed.
---
If a fight has mechanics but fails to make them relevant, those mechanics don't mean anything about the fight's complexity. Kind of one of those "trees fall in a forest with nobody around to hear it" things.
---
Yeah, yeah, I've heard such ultimatums before.
---
But you know what, it is actually between making a decent content progression (including hard content, that shouldn't be shaped to be available to mentally challenged people), or players stopping caring enough even to come for flat  LS releases. 
---
And by "content progression" I don't mean dumbed down modes of the same thing, I mean that there should be actual new content completely locked by at least some difficulty (even dhuum wasn't really that hard), intriguing and  stimulating players to stay in a game get more invested.
---
the installation isn't that hard really.
---
Download the d3d9.dll and put it into the bin 64 folder where you have installed GW2. Start GW2 and you should see it.

In case you're wondering, your comment is getting downvoted so heavily because at first glance it reads as a form of "why can't those gay people celebrate more quietly, where I can't see it", a common sentiment by homophobes and one we hear every pride march, and not as advocacy for something people with stimulation issues can enjoy as well.
---
I unfortunately wasn't able to make it today, but yesterday was awesome! Such a good first Pride for me, both in game and out, and I loved seeing all the love, jokes, and happiness the entire way. :) I hope everyone enjoyed it as much as i did.
---
Disgusting
---
I play solo most of the time and group up only if I have to, I am not in a PvE, PvP or WvW guild and rarely do group content besides metas and word bosses.   
---
I like the fact that I am able to play like that and it always worked so far :)
---
Nah no one cares anymore
---
Dodgejump (and autoclicker, musical macros) being allowed doesnt invalidate my comment, they are just exceptions of the rules set by Anet.
---
there is only the content guide, in the options you can change it to only show map completion stuff, but you probably still need to look on the map.

---
You make a valid point, Kitty. While I'm not sure if the presented builds are the best, boonthief is surely a problem when PUGs try to set their comps, I've experienced this problem first hand.
---
IMO, the main issue people face when trying to build comps with boonthief is not knowing which classes can share boons with 5 or 10 people, and that creates all sorts of problems (I've even had a commander saying we would need 2 thief, one for each sub). 
---
And to all the ppl complaining about the RPing thing: just let her be. If it makes her happy that's all I need. I still can understand the post perfectly and her point is valid. Ppl just love to stir drama.
---
Lol, what the fuck is this shit?
---
I‚Äôm in a guild but I don‚Äôt really talk much on chat or do that many guild activities. Run mostly metas, WBs, PoF bounties, LW episodes when they pop and pug fractals, never had a problem finding someone/group if I needed help with something. All in all a good experience so far. Haven‚Äôt raided yet and probably won‚Äôt in the future.
---
Responsibility isn't exactly shared across the raid in Wing 1 - 3 encounters. People assigned green runners, orb clearers and cannoneers in Wing 1. Mushrooms, saboteurs, mortars and oil throwing all get assigned. Glenna baby sitting, core pushing and Xera buttons get assigned.
---
That these mechanics became more predominant and harder in later wings is because of the tendency of raid groups to create specialists for those roles. That inevitably leads to something like Dhuum greens where three people get assigned and the little mini game is much more difficult to complete.
---
Thankfully, this is getting addressed better in Wing 7. Special action key CC is required from multiple people on Sabir, pillars select half the raid on Adina and pylon kiting on Qadim the Peerless doesn't remove the kiter from the main encounters, as it did in Wings 4, 5 and 6.
---
I guess you‚Äôre looking for a Charrtist then
---
I am in 4 guilds, one of them is my bank guild, the other three are RP guild, non of them has a guild bonus :)
---
You apparently do for GW2 players. A lot of them haven't played MMOs before this game. People who raided in other mmos don't have a problem with GW2 raids.
---
Because I've been called two slurs in-game in the last day.
---
I'm gay and I agree that Pride in general is having the opposite effect.
---
Or do you think normal people on the fence are going to see leather clad guys with giant strap ons in public and think that being gay is normal?
---
Art is subjective so people can find it bad. Being supportive doesn‚Äôt help OP get better, giving constructive criticism does.
---
i pugged raiding and got my leg light armor plus some extra li out of it. sometimes its pain but not too much tbh.
---
Ah so you've never actually gone to pride, gotcha.
---
Also, I've seen way more straight ~kinksters~ with their gear in public and nobody bats an eye. It's almost like there's a double standard on this or something.
---
Istan paladawan and great hall still work, Auric Basin meta too and theres still groups doing silverwastes RIBA join that with the new maps farm and youre good. Selling mats you dont need as much and farm easily helps too.
---
While I'm not a fan of it either, straight folks don't get cake every day. They are they massive grey middle group that no one ever bothers to compliment.
---
Besides, such pride events only really occur in tolerant places, you know, where the discrimination is minimal. The ones that act the proudest, regularly deserve it the least.
---
I've seen enough, and I wasn't even talking about just parades, the whole concept of pride is fucking stupid.
---
Taking pride in inborn traits is dumb as hell, you didn't accomplish anything being born a certain way.
---
Mmmhmm being proud about who you are when the world wants you to be quiet and die away because your gay, straight, bi, ace or what else is so stupid. Sorry about that mate I'll reconsider it :/
---
I did not said that. I literally said that they would probably have to make a new game than attempt to expand on more Lore using a new engine. 
---
I suggest you to read again the whole sentence. Finish that sentence first and then comeback and go on with your input.
---
Hello everyone! For those interested, this comment will as usual be edited later to contain all the skins, enjoy :)

I think they expect the LGBT community to organise it for them.
---
Condi scourge can solo anything.
---
Not sure what do you mean by "hybrid". If that was power/condi hybrid, then do not think it would work in GW2, because mixing power and condi equipment will only make you weak in both. You're limited by the number of action you can do in a minute, and - since in GW2 all conditions stack, - you won't get any benefits from putting some debuff on enemy and power-damaging it meanwhile.
---
Condi is not really good for open world. With power builds shit dies 10 times faster
---
What time zone are you in?
---
To be fair a lot of people deny these inborn traits and atribute it to mental health. That's part of the reason for raising awareness.
---
Right, its not? Obliviously it's not fine to do that, but do you really thinking they coming in have any time or energy to switch the button from what they've been taught their whole lives when these people have to scramble away from their own awful fundamentalists and bombing 3-way murder thunderdome. But those people who are willing to change and see the world outside of their previously taught beliefs change a lot in time when they're given the time and space to do so, just like anyone else. But most of them aren't given that with the racism and xenophobia hounding them wherever they go. It serves more to making them bitter and unwilling to change than you'd fucking realise.
---
Nonetheless, it's pretty clear I can say nothing to your very determined joyless racist and "pride is obliviously just degenerates bringing fetish gear to public" homophobe koolaid drinking ass on this matter, so whatever.
---
Some things should be normalized, violence shouldn't.

---
People's existence isn't political. The very fact you think this is a reason why pride exists. 
---
Because you are implicitly saying these people's existence shouldn't be respected, because doing so is 'politics'.
---
It's insane you even think this considering two of the major characters in the game are in a lesbian relationship with each other, and there are many other such gay NPCs as well.

Currently, I use the [Alumic Mousepad by Roccat](https://en.roccat.org/Mousepads/Alumic). I used a cloth mousepad for a long time but over the years it got rougher and the mouse didn't slide on it that well anymore.
---
The Advantage of the Roccat mousepad is that it is made from metal so it is very easy to clean. It has rubber edges so it doesn't slide around at all.
---
This is such a perfect analogy. People *would* still be happy for you, but if you stomped around the reception asking why nobody is helping to plan *your* wedding right this moment, they'd be righteously angry at you.
---
I am in a 4/5 guilds but none of them is really active. However, I have at least the bonuses from one.
---
I play mostly solo and play with people only when needed - GMS etc.
---
Worked for me so far. I play GW2 to relax and actually enjoy that I do not have to interact with people that much if I don't want to.
---
There's relink happening on friday so you might get a more active server link.
---
Besides, why would you transfer to EU instead of another NA server?

It's not a lot anymore since the story unlocks every 10lvls or so now and you do a chunk of it.

They can easily travel to do their stories and go back to whatever they were doing with no trouble

&gt;  - since in GW2 all conditions stack, - you won't get any benefits from putting some debuff on enemy and power-damaging it meanwhile.
---
Except you are an engi ;)
---
&gt; It's poorly maintained
---
It is exceptionally well maintained, actually, - the page you linked has all armor sets, including one released just a month ago.
---
Nice buzzwords you got there.
---
Story is branched at start, first 30 levels are race specific story, so you won't get any rewards doing story with your friend of other race. Even with same race, you would need same initial setup (let's say those things how you were born, what is your family, which school you had) for having same initial story.
---
That being said, the story slowly culminates together and while some choice paths are exclusive for a set of races (so for example asura can't have story step with saving skritts, as they see them as not worth it at all), you will end up in same main story steps in around lvl 40+ (if you make same choices...well, you can do different ones and play both paths, if you like. Or play different paths on other character).
---
However, you can play with your friend and get his story, then he can play your story. They will be similar in structure, will just have nuances of selected races, so it is quite nice to play them both. However initial story steps take place on racial starting zones, so you will probably travel a lot between them (which is not an issue at all with waypoints). Probably first mutual mission will be lvl 40 in Lions Arch.
---
Just a note, as you will level up, there will be messages from your mentor about stuff going on in dungeons. Don't ignore those and go play story mode of each dungeon as you beat the story of that lvl (let's say on lvl 40 you will get new storystep and dungeon, so you do story and then go dungeon, or vice versa). Those are quite side stories of characters you do main story with, so playing them at the time fits nicely into the story, as those happen in parallel to it.
---
Berzerker mostly has the Torch stuff. Going into Berzerk mode does have a red / firey effect. You also get the Longbow which has fire stuff, but I guess that's not what OP has in mind.
---
Sry but GW2 was designed to cater to both casual and hardcore players. The 5% that cleared Qadim? That was their plan with explorable dungeons. Anet always talked about challenging content before and after release. They failed to do that with dungeon but that doesn't mean that this game is just for casuals and only for them and frankly, the game needs to cater to both otherwise its going to get downwards fast.
---
What I find quite weird is the fact that so called "casuals" oftentimes talk about how the game is not for the hardcore players and just for the casuals and that the game should just cater to them.
---
And the hardcore players? They just want challenging content to be this, challenging. They don't want everything to cater to them. They just want some content thats insanely difficult so they can test themselves there.
---
Regardless, it doesn't really explain the downvotes.
---
Before I block you for not using even half of your brain power I'll explain it just once. If the core game was designed from the start to teach u something during leveling nobody would care if HoT is 'hard' because people would be accustomed to difficulty spikes. And because it's not the case people get upset and toxic about everything that requies more than pressing 1 on keyboard.
---
Well, engineer is my least played class, so I may be wrong here - but I got an impression that all good engi builds are either power or condi. If I'm wrong - please share that hybrid build, I'd like to try that.

Oh, hey! I loved your Transhearne! Glad to see more love for that cabbage being trans :3

Boon thief: everything but alacrity on 10 people. Should have high enough boon duration. Use extra toughness and vitality gear as required so long as boon duration is fine. 
---
Alac ren: needed with Righteous Rebel and boon duration gear.
---
Any other healer: prioritise healing unless your boon thief asks for additional coverage of particular boons or there are times during an encounter when the thief cannot get Plasma (Adina 75/50/25 for example). For such moments, you probably do not need (much) boon duration gear.
---
Hod? Can you elaborate?
---
Let me guess‚Ä¶ clownfish are gross too.
---
Hey Rivelon, sorry for the late response. While P.I and bane signet can be better as it provides 200+power to all soulbeasts, it's not recommended to use if you have 4 openers. The runs are already way too fast and if an opener gets dolphin path, he will need to invite people from the core group while he's doing the path because they will already have finished with the other openers. I can definitely see it working if you have 5 openers tho
---
You can still use a bow, and you can swap back anytime.

Oh FFS!!! The world? Seriously, the world???? I‚Äôm gay... and I‚Äôve been on more pride marches than I remember...

However I‚Äôm not gonna just let rhetoric like ‚Äúthe world wants you to be quiet‚Äù... frankly love, most of the world really doesn‚Äôt give a fuck. Take the chip of your shoulder.

Solo basically all the way. It's fun. GW2's system of dynamic socialization suits me just fine. I don't need company to do my daily flax farm or whatever, but the odd banter during metas is just the right amount of interaction.

As one of the MMO players who see other people more as content than as players, I love that I'm able to dip in and out of different gamemodes just as I want.

I'm a completely solo player since launch - generally since I get annoyed by demands to be on voicechat or Discord and I don't have regular playing hours. 
---
I generally stay out of structured group content. So no fractals, no raiding, no wvw. All I do is play open world PvE, hopping into various map meta squads or doing a world boss train. Usually chase achievements if I can be bothered to do them, and if they can be done solo. And of course, fashion wars.

Mmhmm I do understand your point, but I do still have more negative view with people who are like, very say, aggressively (lol) apathetic about these issues.
---
Oh I can probably weight to the a bit hamfisted issue on the "all men" mentalisy, I do think it's silly to go there but from what I understand its an attempt to get to people speak up about it because... So many of he root issues with misogyny are from men not standing up when they should, because it's just the "hehe guys being guys" mentality which is just, honestly garbage. But I do sympathize on the frustration towards it, especially as a very short trans guy. I don't really want to open my mouth when someone 3 heads taller than me starts being a shit, because it's scary, but that just also leads to the annoyance when people who aren't tiny gremlins and don't agree with shitheads just staying quiet and letting things continue as they do.
---
And tbh it's important to do what you can do, and I don't think not wanting to spend every moment of your life thinking about things that suck is apathy.
---
You can probably do 90% of the game, including HoT, by just autoattacking and dodging
---
I run a Guardian PVE, I want legendary armor PVE style to be able change my builds, armor and weapons, to being firebrand , or DH and guard. I am a shiftworker, who shifts move, so I can‚Äôt get a static raid group as I am unreliable timewise, throw in Oceanic and you have a impossible mix to try raiding with. So I want PVE legendary armor too, like PvP and WvW. It  stupid to have PVE raid armor only available, for 10% of player population , when most people play PVE anyway.
---
I loved boon thief tanking Adina CM and it helped us get the kill in about 20 minutes or so despite the group having roleplayer friends who have never completed wing 5 and have very few kills of wing 6. However, that required advance discussion of the setup with our usual staff boon share tempest going full magi, our chrono going alacrity renegade and the druid and other chrono going DPS. It only worked because we agreed on things and prepared in advance.
---
If you want to play boon thief you are already asking your group to adapt to you over a standard setup so further requesting very specific healing builds, that aren't needed given the overhealing in GW2, may be a step too far.
---
I've given my TLDR summary in other posts in this thread regarding support composition with boon thief. That is pretty much all that is needed for a group to successfully run boon thief.
---
I honestly consider the HoT raids easier
---
dungeons where supposed to be that. original tone colin:  
---
&gt; Those are intended to be the super hard, very coordinated group style content like Slaver's Exile, or Fissure of Woe, or the Underworld.  
---
if you played gw1 uw / fow you know what we expected and didn't get. and now raids are just getting powercrept to death.
---
I have been playing since release and over the years I have participated in all the different types of content the game is offering, PvP, WvW, World Boss, Metas, Achi, Fashion Wars, Festivals, Living Story, Fractals, Dungeon, and Raid.
---
For most of those year I was solo as my friend never got into the game and I am a little bit shy. However, I do made some few friends I was able to play with for some period of time but as of today I haven't been able to play with any of them for months. But I do have a WvW guild that usually disband around september/october and regroup before summer.
---
During all those years of solo playing I never had trouble completing content I was interested in, even group content. Through only pugging, I was able to complete every single raid achievement (even w7), get all my title including envoy's herald.
---
This is something that I really love about gw2, the option of being able to complete litteraly any content with pugs.
---
And boy do I love the 4 talking points internet Centrists‚Ñ¢Ô∏è and right folks have: Fact don't care about your feelings but mine because I keep making mine up, Gays are gross, Gays are gross but what about the muslims, but my racism is fine because I conflate every single muslim to a group of radicals that they are also being killed by. Also do you even like, live in the real world, because you've had to see the fucking weirdo racist panic every single country is having about homing the refugees.

The advice you got are good but be aware of that those are elite specs and you need the expansions for it and you wont be playing elite specs until you reach lvl 80. 
---
Does not really change anything but just so you know that your core warrior is just a normal smashing and bashing warrior to level with and then when you get to lvl 80 you can if you have the expansions get the elite specs and play it the way you want.

Pretty sure its anyone since i moved an alt last week and it wasn't f2p

Hijacking this comment a bit since OP also asked for other builds, OP can also go for a hybrid chrono. It‚Äôs a small trade off from pure DPS to both DPS and supportive abilities and is usually requested like crazy in both raids and fractals

Thank you for your answer
---
And yes, I'm an idiot and it's most likely just fresh air
---
Do you maybe remember the name or have a link of such website, I'd love to check it out and I might give HoD a try while the dust on EU front settles down so thank you for recommending!
---
You need to make sure that you have the Microsoft Visual C and Direct X redistributables installed as well as is mentioned in the troubleshooting section.  If you don't have them installed then either ArcDPS won't run or the game will crash.
---
I'm playing 90% of my time solo since launch. I never really got into guilds. The last time I tried to socialize was when raids came out but that didn't went so well so I never got into raiding. 
---
Back in the days I did dungeon clears almost every day with a few friends but after dungeons were declared as dead content and the rewards were nerfed all of them left the game. I taught myself to solo all dungeon paths that are soloable. When I feel like it I put the path up in lfg so others can leech it. From time to time I do pug T4 fractals since soloing those is not worth it. 
---
I do meta events almost every day but since I don't have to interact with anyone at all it still feels like playing solo, same goes for WvW.
---
I have 1 friend which I know for almost 6 years now. We met while roaming EotM and we still play WvW together sometimes, either zerging or roaming while talking on discord.
---
I find renegade condi short bow +mace/axe to be really fun to play in open world content.
---
Mine too. The other two are [](#s "shit")
---
Just please this time have the Ghost os Ascalon guys write all of them, the other two books were terrible.
---
Right...? I'm not sure whether to laugh or feel bad for the person.

it's released, check the TP

If you subtract the middle half of the wing it's definitely the best... Statues and River make Escort look good.
---
&gt; God calls for Christians to love everyone
---
Sodom and Gommorah received the most of his love, right? In that case Dante\_Avalon said nothing wrong, "fire and brimstone" is somewhat close to "burn".
---
Also you can search info about muslim's little friend "Jihad". Or is it also a demonstration of "love"?
---
That said, they are reverse chronologically if you read them in publication order, so going back in time. (Also they are completely not realted to each other either in plot or characters.)
---
Sea of Sorrows is set 106 years before the start of GW2. Edge of Desiny is 6 years before GW2. Ghosts of Ascalon is 1 year before.
---
&gt; And yet wing 5 is by far the hardest, best designed, and most intricate raid wing.
---
For the most part, but I would put some doubt on that regarding Desmina specifically. With the way how random the walls are the encounter can go from going swiftly to absolutely bonkers in terms of space I wouldn't call it the best designed encounter.
---
I can't imagine how mount for more than 1 player could work. Did you know that mount and character are the same thing while mounted? It is one unit. Your raptor is literally legs for the character. They are not separate things. How player can ride other player if there are no interactions between them?
---
Every mount has its role. Raptor can jump far, roller beetle is super fast on the ground, jackal can use sand portals, springer can jump high, skimmer is fast above the water or quicksands, griffon is fast in the air and scyscale can fly straight up and stick to the walls. And there is a warclaw that has use only in WvW. We could have a underwater mount for the "collection", but why add some slow mounts like dolyaks? If you want to enjoy exploration and do it slowly, you can go on foot.
---
This. The "endgame" is challenging repeatable content.
---
In GW2's case, Fractals of the Mist and Raids, which aren't too challenging in the first place (one of the reasons for the "GW2 has no endgame" meme).
---
Wishing you could drop a sand shade in the middle of that parade in a video game is not the same as saying "I want to kill gays". Are you really that unable to draw a joke from this? 
---
Literally using the same logic you just applied to his comment, you're saying anyone who plays pvp servers is the same as saying "I wish I could kill people". Feel dumb yet?
---
Mounts really need better controls, specially their own skill buttons, and each mount should have its own customizable hotkeys, instead of sharing them with the rest.

You should have a look at the Razer Goliathus Control (fissure edition). I got these in various sizes (XL for my main rig and smaller ones for my laptops), I‚Äôve used them for years and they are rock solid (durable, help a ton with mouse precision and they stay where you place them).
---
You have a good point there - and I know WoW isn't the best benchmark, but I have a hard time believing that the only reason first clears take so much longer is that their best guilds have bad gear. That just doesn't add up. It is (at least partially) about raw HP and totally about the stackup of mechanics and teamwork.
---
Compare Dhuum and Qadim Peerless: 
---
The mechanics in Dhuum engage everyone in the group - 3 greens, 1 kiter, 1 tank, random affliction, random chains, soul split on everyone, random mini soul-split that you have to dodge, fear cracks, and more, all of which mean that the boss can't stay stationary so you're going to have to move and adjust your rotation. (i'd also be willing to bet that Anet didn't envision the fight with a kiter. they probably thought the person with affliction would take a golem) And if you miss any of those mechanics, someone is going to go down or die. Downs are almost worse than deaths because dps loss sucks, and people tunnel vision on rezzing instead of doing the next mechanic.
---
For QP: 3 pylons, 1 tank, random lightning arrows, and maybe an orb kiter (i think that's how Anet envisioned it). The dps just does afk rotation next to a stationary boss and occasionally you have to throw come cc onto a pylon or anomaly, but that's the fight. the only other moderately dangerous mechanic is lightning, and you can facetank it in normal.
---
Dhuum CM throws another whole mechanic on the fight that you have to watch the echo. EVERYONE has to pay attention and modify play accordingly. all the time, not just once in a while.
---
QP CM is a little better, it adds new phases at 40%, 30%, and 20%, and the lightning permanently reduces the play area if you miss the mechanic. That sounds a lot more like the dhuum vanilla fight. plus, by giving real consequences to the lightning, it forces engagement by the team; and by making you pick up orbs to free your (randomly chosen) ally, you get spatial awareness too like deimos tears.
---
It isn't just about comp, and it isn't just about gear. The fight design in some of these fights does not engage the whole squad into active participation. I don't want to play afk dps, I want a high skill ceiling on fights. Sure, the raiding community is generally 'better' at raid fights now and we may have solved W5 faster if it was released now. Power creep is also a real thing with elite specs and patches. I agree. But the fights could also be significantly better designed - at least make the CMs be 10 minutes of panic like dhuum cm. I just want some goal to work on that isn't grinding for endless stacks of T6 mats.
---
How is that a thing I don't even know. Maybe it's more common in usa? Where I live this is unheard of (luckily!). I would run away faster than light if my man proposed to me at a wedding :')
---
Awww so many assumptions... Here I‚Äôll help with your tin foil hat.
---
Firstly we ‚Äúall‚Äù didn‚Äôt know what he meant by playing ‚Äúalone‚Äù since to me that means ‚Äúalone‚Äù.. (old people and those pesky definitions eh?)
---
I also stated simply by design (and for the reasons about personal instances versus open map exploration/travel as explained above)... gw2 cannot ever be played start to finish by anyone.. ‚Äúalone‚Äù. (Servers would push you together and anytime you help or got helped you were not... alone)
---
That‚Äôs what I pointed out AND that maybe if you are also in 3 or 4 guilds too..
---
Yeah you act alone but you are far from it
---
The event was towards raising money for an org that helps LGBT+ indivduals in countries where violence and persecution of such is common. Still cringe?
---
People like you are the reason normal gay people people don't like this "pride" bullshit.
---
It's mad, funny, new game called " My friend Pedro".
---
If something has no survivability in your opinion, that means you're playing it wrong. Every full-dps raid build is super squishy and going sword weaver to OW is like a suicide. You want to survive more battles while playing solo? Don't take meta builds. Make your own build, think what do you need (more damage, more defense, break stuns, more boons, more healing) and find it in your traits.
---
I know it only from movies.
---
The whole parade thing is political whether you like it or not. And let's be honest here 99% of LGBTs are left wing (i mean in general i'm not american).
---
Aw, is he sending his attack dogs in now too? Also cool going on your homophobia too, keep it up boy you'll be loved in no time.
---
It's a general rule for every franchise, not just GW2.
---
I'm still after the endless Djinn tonic. It eludes me so.
---
I think you mean freedom fighters besieged by a tyrant foreign queen.
---
*Thank you!*
---
Solo player here. Like 90% of my journey was solo and 10% with ingame/real life friends. I rarely raid and stop raiding on PoF and cleared most of my raid experience with PuG (less drama than guild runs). I still have so much fun solo matching fashion wars and collecting collection. Fractals are just a bonus when im bored. I no longer play but i can assure you, you will have so much fun even solo. Plus most of the players in game are friendly and helpful, so it should be no problem.
---
You've also got to consider that all three books were being worked on at the same time by three different authors.
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
Yikes, amirite?
---
&gt; Also cool going on your homophobia too
---
Exactly how am I homophobic? Also, you are playing way too fucking hard into this flamboyant, quirky gay stereotype. Might want to consider building your personality on something else, because people like you just give more ammo to the actual homophobes who point at gay people as degenerates.
---
&gt; You don‚Äôt play solo if you are in a set of 3 ‚Äúrole playing‚Äù guild with hundreds of other players.
---
You don¬¥t know how many players are in these guild, but believe me they are not hundreds.
---
&gt; Btw RP guild is most likely considered PVE based so yeah there‚Äôs that...) 
---
RP is not PvE because I am not fighting the environment, you are typing a story while standing in the world.
---
&gt; You cannot play alone.. it‚Äôs impossible and if you are ever alone on a  map. It will close and force you onto a more populated map (server side) 
---
You are right, because it is an online game I can¬¥t play alone like I can play a single player game, but I can try to play solo and as far as it is possible to play a multiplayer game I play solo and that was the question of the op, he wanted to know if somebody is doing that and how well it works.
---
&gt; So get used to it... You‚Äôll find playing alone actually holds you back  from quite a bit anyway so be happy for the occasional smiling face and  helpful players around you.  
---
Holding me back from what exactly?
---
&gt; (But do us a favor and stop telling people you are a solo RP‚Äôer lolz)   Do you talking fake pirate speak to yourself in the mirror or something?  (So no you ain‚Äôt even close to solo bro if you got 3 guilds of  RP‚Äôers.... Jesus that‚Äôs got to be awful chat to try to follow while your  playing... ‚Äúsolo‚Äù) 
---
You know, sometime a tavern is empty and to generate RP someone has to start it, so sometimes I do solo RP until someone reads it and joins.
---
Technical speaking ?
---
Once again, r/TIHI.
---
We do, fondly. Good times.
---
That's neat, the person never said they shouldn't play WvW as any core profession.
---
Pedoro, Pedoro
---
One question, why?
---
Endgame is intrinsically PvE, since you're facing a predetermined challenge. PvP and WvW are player-driven, you face other players, so the nature of the challenge is always different.
---
Good PvE endgame and good PvP environments are two different things, and you should ideally provide both, separately.
---
Solo player here, 100% map completion, ascended weapons (only 2 so far but working on them)

What was funny about the comment?

Monthly Achievements got removed

And the only Weekly content is:

* the WvW Track
---
*  Guild Missions 
---
* Raids
---
Atleast as far as i know  
---
Feel free to complete if i forgot something
---
The *skin* are a prestige item. Switching arom is a QoL feature.  
---
QoL should never be prestige-exclusive.  In fact, most QoL in the game are gemstore upgrades. That's not prestige, that's monetization, and even if you an't buy gems or pla high-end content you can at leas buy gems slowly over time and get them.   
---
When you get PvP or WvW legendary armor the skin is practically the same, with no legendary effects.  That keeps HoT raid armor as having all the shiny prestige.
---
Same should happen with ascended weapons and trinkets. Keeping the prestigeous one prestigeous, but also have an alternate easier but grindier method to update normal ascended into legendary with no effects.
---
Many people would welcome being able to get legendary trinkets without the glowy orbs too.
---
For your anger issues? Well at least you know to blame yourself, that's progress.
---
-Raids reset on a weekly basis
---
-Every week you are able to make a new character and get a free BLC chest key from the level 10 personal story step
---
Not anymore. There used to be monthlies but they've been removed around 2014 I think
---
Indeed. I never finished the base game story (but may revisit one day) but the HoT content onwards has been excellent.
---
it's a furry
---
Black lion key farming is on a weekly cooldown. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Key_farming
---
Raid rewards also reset weekly.
---
I believe guild mission rewards are weekly?
---
As far as I know there aren‚Äôt any monthly rewards anymore. Used to be monthly achievements but they got rid of them.
---
Ascalon to Ascalonians!
---
The general Internet routing problem is fixed now so if you're still having problems then it isn't that.
---
There were monthlies way back before December 2014 but there were never weeklies.
---
&gt;/u/farptr "For any network admins, a Verizon customer is leaking the full BGP table and its screwing up everything."

 That's not how BGP works
---
now i absolutely have to
---
I only ever go the other way so I don't know the optimal prices you want, but I know when my gems to gold is best which would be the worst for you. 
---
I watch for the price of 250g to drop below 1100 gems, ideally to the bottom out at ~1030. This most frequently happens when BLKeys ore on sale like the other week or when new really popular stuff is in the store (I'm expecting a solid dip when the skyscale pack drops). So if you see 250g costing under ~1200 that indicates to me the trend is more people going gold -&gt; gems so your prices are higher.
---
You‚Äôve clearly never met hyperbole.
---
things like this https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Activity
---
also raids reset is weekly, but no nothing like dailies where you get reward for 3 simple tasks.
---
festivals might count as monthlies if you really want to stretch that meaning.
---
First awesome work, I always think about how my relation with video games were if I would've studied something programming related.

 Second for Reddit formatting the browser add-on Reddit Enhancement Suite is really helpful if you don't know it already.

Yeah. it's not like I hate parties, but it's nice when a quiet room has been set aside for those who want some peace and quiet.

I prefer to vaporize Champions instead of "surviving" 10 min to them. If you know your shit you won't go down even as a nude glass cannon.
---
You know, prior to the human conquest of Ascalon, it was charr lands.
---
It‚Äôs called Old Ascalon because it‚Äôs from way back when.
---
No problems on EU (just logged in)
---
However since discord is down for "general internet outage" and some sites are too, it probably is related to that or just coincidence?
---
The Charr banned worship of Gods are seeing meowth.
---
Can confirm. EU servers are online, Discord is offline
---
I think the majority of players barely interact with anyone else in-game.
---
It never changed since 2012 and it is not a important problem so don¬¥t get your hopes up.
---
I can second this. I have the i9 and even at wvw blob vs blob fights I have 40+ fps and that‚Äôs with almost everything maxed out, except for character model quality which I set to low or lowest. At world bosses it is at 50-55+ fps. The rest is obviously much higher, like raids, fractals, pvp, from 70+ to 140+ depending on how many players are around.
---
These results are both okay and not so much. Since I have a 144hz monitor it is better to always have 144+ fps to avoid any screen tearing or other image disturbances. 
---
Overall I would also recommend getting a 144hz monitor, for some unknown to me reason every game has become very smooth compared to 60hz, even when it‚Äôs running at 60-100fps
---
Mirage is pretty great. Axe provides a good amount of burst damage for a Condi build, so you can wipe out weak mobs relatively fast, and scepter makes soloing champions almost trivial due to how easily you can kite, dodge, and distract them with clones.
---
I thought the same, but gave up after having farmed some hundred map currencies.
---
It said "this game needs open world pvp" 
---
The sentiment is that it would be funny if we could attack and disrupt these gatherings for the fun of it. Trolling if you will. Some people find it humorous. Others dont. If you dont find it funny, that doesnt make the op some homophobe. He didnt say "I hate gays" he just expressed his troll in a dark humorish kind of way which butthurt people with a different sense of humor got offended by.
---
Look at most top comedian in today's day in age... race, gender, sexuality... literally anything and everything is subject to comedic relief that many people find funny even if the comedians themselves dont even believe what they're saying. And jokes get really really dark and edgy. 
---
The dude made a dark video game joke and Billy and the butthurt gang took it as literal hate speech. 
---
It's funny how quick these guys are to exclude people with a crude sense of humor while their whole parade is generally about being inclusive to everyone. It would be different if he didnt make his comment in an obvious attempt at making a joke.
---

---
Brrr. Couldn't imagine going 150% nuke all the time. You have to be at the top of your game at every single moment. Something goes south, you're waypointing.
---
This is the same management that insisted on writing the Personal Story at launch, ignoring their writers. 
---
GW2 management has been historically kind of dumb.
---
Cuz there is nothing else to do.
---
"I am going to ignore everything you just said, shit on the game board, build a strawman to represent you which I will now proceed to dismantle in the same comment and pretend that I "won" the argument"
---
Also, instead of writing rambly paragraphs oh fucking nothing, at least try to break up your comments into separate points.
---
&gt; Ho hum I can see that you truly understand these issues and come in good faith with calling the LGBT community with so funny longer acronyms and a hivemind,
---
Kettle calling the pot black considering straight off you labeled me as a homophobe.
---
What else would you call the LBTQBBQ movement than a hivemind? People like you who consider themselves part of the movement actively try to get rid of the people who do not 100% adhere to the ideology of the movement.
---
What comes to the LBTQBBQ acronym, It changes every single fucking year. Apparently now its [LGBTTQQIAAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT). This is confusing at best and its like a fucking bad joke at this point.
---
&gt; and pretty clearly think of the gay people who jerk off conservatives as "normal ones"
---
Do you have examples of such "gay people who jerk off conservatives"? The only one that comes to my mind is Milo, and he is exactly the kind of flamboyant gay stereotype.
---
&gt; and act like they're disliked in the community for not being a part of a "hivemind" instead of being extremely unpleasant people who parrot homophobes talking points, like your dear friend did.
---
Way to dismantle your own argument! You claim that people "like my dear friend" have to act like they are disliked in the hivemind community, while you are actively labeling all the gay people in this thread disagreeing with you as homophobes / racist etc based on nothing.
---
&gt; And not to even speak of them gleefully supporting the people trying to make our life shit....
---
Who would that be? 
---
Im not 100% sure on this, considering how hard you are trying to avoid giving your opinion on the issue, but are actively trying to downplay the obvious homophobia refugees are bringing into western countries. Is that not supporting people "trying to make our life shit"? You only have to look what is happening in Sweden and Britain to see examples of this. Latest example of this that comes to mind is the [protests in britain](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/may/26/birmingham-anderton-park-primary-muslim-protests-lgbt-teaching-rights)
---
&gt; And also the racism.
---
What racism?
---
&gt; Not only muslims because I know you're gonna try to bring that up.
---
You are complaining how white straight people are oppressing you. It is pointed out to you that western countries, Finland included, are importing large groups of people from countries that are very anti-lgbt. You call these people racist, even while clear examples, from left leaning sources like wikipedia are presented to you, while last I checked, you have given no examples of the straight white males oppressing you, beyond disagreeing with the pride parades.
---
&gt; And transphobia.
---
What transphobia?
---
&gt; And the self loathing!
---
What self-loathing?
---
The rest of this shit is just a plain incomprehensible mess.
---
I know you're trolling because it's not possible to be this dense, but there is no double standard.  Straight people are not discriminated against, attacked, or killed for being straight. Nobody is saying you can't have pride, only that having an event to encourage your pride isn't necessary because you aren't killed, prosecuted, and shamed for being straight. Minorities shouldn't have to grow up ashamed and afraid.  Pride is the opposite of shame, that's the point.  
---
Pride month happens in June because in the 60s New York cops routinely raided bars and beat and arrested all the gay people.  In June 1969 there was a riot as a result of police violence, and over the next year the fight for equal rights grew dramatically.  On the anniversary of the riot in 1970 the first gay pride march happened, and 50 years later gay people are still discriminated against, so the marches continue.
---
There are three hybrid builds which are as good as the power or condi variant. Firebrand, reaper, and Weaver.
---
Hybrid Weaver is very marginally weaker (~1%) than condi Weaver and significantly weaker than power, hybrid reaper is stronger than condi but weaker than power, and hybrid firebrand is stronger than power, and marginally stronger than condi solo but weaker when near your party.
---
Go Piken... they are the best server
---
Ty for the advice
---
What kind of bonuses?
---
I agree with you, but I, too, think that it's never going to change. The game is riddled with little flaws like that and they have zero priority.
---
Crazy how you cant even say it's not as good than what others did without getting downvoted, I love this subreddit.

Not even close, feels forced even when it's too far off
---
After making a new character and doing the first story mission you can enter PvP. You are instantly lvl 80 with all skills (and Pets in the case of the ranger) unlocked. You can experiment a bit with builds on training golems.
---
It also has a shop with extremely cheap weapons so you can experiment with all weapons the class has too.
---
I think it's west of the Northern Blighting Tower, but it's been a while.
---
You can try out the class using the level 80 boost before deciding. If you end up not liking the class, just cancel the 80 boost.  
---
If you have an empty character slot, you can make a new character of that class, finish the tutorial mission, and head into PvP where you will be temporarily boosted to level 80, unlock all traits and skills, and can test out builds to your heart's content.   
---
The only disadvantage of this method compared to the level 80 boost trial is that you will be relying on the PvP-balanced  versions of the skills. Normally this isn't a huge difference.
---
&gt; So what do you guys think?
---
I think this post is pointless.
---
River I could maybe get behind but Rivers and Statues back to back feels like a rather large speedbump in Wing 5. Even a single 'easy' boss there would have done a ton to improve the pacing of the Wing IMO.
---
Can you elaborate on the basi venom on Matthias? Is it bugged and doesn't work on the sacrifice target?
---
You could just post it as a text post to edit it later.

This is the last we heard, I believe.

https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/78590/render-server-outage
---
It is damaging; completely so... one doesn‚Äôt need rhetoric and hyperbole when their are actual issues to be debated. Using it shuts down the debate and closes people off. Most straight people in the western world aren‚Äôt particularly bothered about LGBT people, so statements like ‚Äúconstant oppression‚Äù etc... just turns off most of the audience as it‚Äôs so wildly over the top as to warrant people just sighing and shaking their heads and no longer paying heed.
---
Also you seem to be putting forward a very Americo-centric viewpoint of the concept of countries in general. The vast majority of first world countries are fine with LGBT issues... this hasn‚Äôt always been the case, something I‚Äôm keenly aware of first hand; but let‚Äôs not try and paint a picture that we dragged everyone else screaming and kicking into being accepting and liberal. That simply wasn‚Äôt the case.
---
Attitudes in Europe changed due to various social groups coming together and realising that the LGBT community, wasn‚Äôt this ominous other... but rather just family members and loved ones. It took work from dedicated people, across the spectrum of backgrounds, sexualities, political leanings and class backgrounds. It‚Äôs been an amazing show of change and solidarity and we should cherish that and not continually catastrophic in a way that make us seem the gays who screamed wolf.
---
Surely you can‚Äôt be arguing in favour of hyperbole and rhetoric? It‚Äôs always better to be accurate with these things, so that when their is a problem and we raise it, people take those concerns seriously and it‚Äôs just chucked under the heading of ‚ÄúOh they‚Äôre being dramatic again‚Äù.

The vast majority of 1st world countries, overwhelmingly favour LGBT equality. Laws and politics may have taken time to catch up, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs reflective of a bedrock of reticent hatred that still pervades. Yes homophobes exist, as do racists and sexists and so on... however fundamentally that‚Äôs not what defines our societies and those people are vastly in the minority as almost any survey on the issue will tell you.
---
I‚Äôm not advocating for silence on LGBT issues, I‚Äôm advocating for accuracy and a simple acknowledgement that many of us and in many countries across the world; our biggest allies are the straight community and the many kind, good and decent people there in. 
---
We should not be advocating a bunker mentality as to do so, undermines the many issues across the world that many LGBT people still have to endure... for example Russia, China, certain partners of South America, Africa, various arab states, Pakistan and so on....  
---
Those places still have huge battles for their LGBT populations to feel safe and accepted, let‚Äôs not throw ‚ÄúI got called a puff by a nob head on a bus‚Äù into the same grouping as the system oppression of a people. 
---
We need to keep things in context and keep the dialogue open and accurate; muddying it with ‚ÄúI‚Äôm oppressed continually in my massively accepting country‚Äù just turns people off and silences the many valid complaints that still need to be made.
---
Everyone knows that training guilds are the best way to get into raids, regardless of being casual or not.
---
Most bosses can be carried by 1-3 people doing mechanics so cooperation isnt really a big issue either.
---
It all seems to be restored?
---
I‚Äôm not trying to be combative and just want to address the topic by offering a different perspective:
---
* First, inclusivity doesn‚Äôt need to mean including people who hate.
---
* Second, there is equal (if not more) reason to believe the person just hates the idea of Pride as to believe they just like the idea of killing a bunch of people in-game.
---
In reference to the second point, I don‚Äôt even think it was a moderately good joke if it was supposed to be one. That‚Äôs a bit of an aside, but maybe it doesn‚Äôt help that it wasn‚Äôt really funny. I wouldn‚Äôt laugh if he said it about a gathering of any other kind.
---
The person you argued with may be overreacting to equate it to killing gay people, but I think you‚Äôve gone a bit in the other direction as well. As with most matters the sweet spot you both missed is in the middle: to me, it seems like he probably dislikes Pride specifically and expressed that as wishing he could disrupt the ingame parade, but it DOESN'T equate to wishing he could actually kill gay people. It‚Äôs a video game after all, killing people in the game is just an expression of either competition or sometimes dislike, not actual desire to murder.
---
This is exactly why I stopped playing WoW. I play GW2 now and then, but 99% I‚Äôm solo like you.
---
It would be cool if they brought back the monthlies, but as quarterlies instead 3 months instead 1.
---
With so much more time to complete them, the achievements could be more varied and require things that take much longer than a month for people with less time to play every week, like completing every dungeon path, or every fractal, fighting in several raids, defeating some raid bosses, capturing a lot of different specific WvW objectives, or winning matches in every PvP arena.
---
The Monthly and Daily AP that now share a 15K cap caps could then be split back into Daily and Quarterly caps, and this would allow removing the AP from now unobtainable achievements, making them "feats of strength" with no AP, while at the same time not removing any AP from those who earned it by moving it to the new quarterly cap.   
---
This would allow new players to catch up in terms of AP with old players who were in S1 story and side-stories and old festivals without taking away any achievements or AP from veterans as old achievements would remain in the historical section, and old AP would be added to the quarterly cap.   
---
Since the quarterly cap would be the next round multiple of 5K, veteranjs would still be able to earn some extra quarterly AP too, they'll get a headstart for veterancy from the AP they earned in S1 and S1 sidestories festivals.
---
They should also rework Season dailies eventually too, the list is getting a tad long.  
---
For example, they could keep them as separate sections while a season is going on, but once the next season or expansion is released, all the season dailies from the previous season are merged into a single season category with an assortment of daily achievements from different maps.  
---
Season dailies could also get their own AP and a cap. Like 5K or so.
---
&gt; Affiliate: ERROR:NOT_A_STREAMER
---
Haha thinking that even streamers will get partnered.

I'm primarily a solo player for the last 4+ years.  Started playing with my brother during Wintersday 2012; he fell off pretty quick, but I was still having lots of fun, so I recruited several friends to play.  We played together through most of LS1, as well as the first bit of LS2, before we started getting burnt out for various reasons. Fast forward to HoT, and we're all back, but we all kinda hate HoT, so we only make it about a month.  Ever since, I've been coming back by myself sporadically, mostly just to play through the story of Living World episodes, though I came back for another month not long after PoF launch, and I'm in the midst of a return now that's lasted 6 weeks so far.  
---
I mostly just do open world stuff.  I've recently started pugging fractals, which has been fun.  I still try and do WvW, I was pretty active back in 2013, but I find I'm enjoying it less and less each time I come back.  I also occasionally dip my toes into sPvP; it's fun, even though I have no idea what I'm doing. 
---
I find Guild Wars 2 a pretty nice solo experience. I don't feel that I'm gated off from anything I actually want, and the general design is really friendly towards casual grouping.  If my friends did decide to get back into the game after all these years, I wouldn't complain, but I'm enjoying GW2 right now as a chill game I can just play by myself to unwind. The pace of content releases has been really nice lately as well, which has gone a long way to helping me stay engaged.
---
If you go to the Options panel, and choose the "disable events and story" setting for the content guide, it will point towards the nearest map completion objective, and if it's close enough it will appear in the edge of the minimap.
---
Easier just to mod for infinite flying.  You wont get banned, I've had it for a while.
---
Because it is a LS Maps it will not drop Loot by the Map Completion under Level 80
---
This was supposed to be patched out after people exploited the infinite TTF to farm Bloodstone Fen: https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/920912/#Comment_920912
---
If you somehow did get this key on a low level character, stop doing it immediately or you might be punished for exploiting a bug.
---
&gt; Having a "Friend" is optional 
---
Oh thank god. I would hav.... I mean ... A friend of mine would have been screwed.
---
He listened to his inner voice and became anime
---
I promised my self to always play solo after i had some serious gameing-rehabtalk/meetings 8 years ago.
---
Bought 1 raid to unlock the masterys. Used to love  commanding in edge of the mist. Mostly focus on achivements that doesn't require friends/pugs.
---
Kinda like it. I can stop playing when ever i want or need. No strings attached to others. And it feels like i easly lose motivation, sometimes in a good way, sometimes in a bad way.
---
The funny thing is a week or two ago I had been looking for basically this exact video (thorough and clear LS1 overview) and youtube and on WPs page but couldn't find it, now here it is! Happy to have this, loved the trip back. I see all of you jealous you don't have a colored tempered spinal blades backpack...
---
Pretty sure they were having a hissy fit somewhere.
---
Raid scene is less dead. Was toying around with the idea because finding a pug on NA is starting to get ridiculous, and my schedule doesn't really allow for a static clear.
---
You sir are a saviour, Ty so much
---
It used to be much worse.
---
Part of the problem is the stacking damage number not properly indicating how much damage you are actually doing. That makes some people stick to flame jet, which results in lackluster damage.
---
The flamethrower is a wave mower cleave weapon, meant to attack 3 enemies at a time that do not like to stick together.  
---
This works well against incoming enemy waves and to tag enemies in orr events, but not so much against a single boss unless it has several damage points like the Claw.
---
I very much doubt the intricately forged sword turned ghostly is from a singe century-or-less time period the charr ruled Ascalon over a thousand years ago, when 250 years ago their weapons looked like [an apprentice blocksmith's first works](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Gallery_of_Charr_weapons). And to ArenaNet, five years is old.
---
I mean, if you think about it, it was introduced with Langmar Estate guild puzzle, where charr never were. So it's always been a human-made weapon, or more accurately, a Foefire-ghost-made weapon.
---
Oh well... Thanks for the link, I can stop wasting my time now then and delete the post =/
---
(That screen was from a level 80, I only did 2 completions so it was totally expectable to not get a key yet.)
---
It's such a bummer, though. Something that requires a bit more skill plus a Gemstore item patched out because of another Gemstore item.
---
Shame the bow isn't available.
---
Technically season 5 would have been in development since a star to guide us. Once one team is done with their episode they move onto their next one. For example team 1 worked on daybreak then a star to guide us and now working on episode 1 of season 5.
---
It would be fun if there was a profession that could use portals offensively.
---
but that isnt what im advocating either....
---
LGBT people in many western countries experience no higher rates of abuse than any other minority. I'm not defining things as less oppressive or more oppressive based on threat; im saying that for many 1st world countries, they just simply arent oppressive.
---
Yes their are hate filled people in all countries and that needs tackled, but we shouldnt label a country by its lowest common denominator. In europe, LGB isnt an issue at all and now does it limits ones prospects for ones future. (look at westminster, it has many openly LGB politicians, or Ireland, who has an openly gay leader).
---
Most people in these countries are very openminded when it comes to the LGB community.
---
I will accept that the T, in the LGB spectrum still suffers from abuse and theirs still some way to go there.... but even with that, the inroads being made there is massive.
---
I personally just feel its really important to keep claims into perspective, so that when we as a community do say "this is an issue.", it cant be dismissed as "youre just being dramatic!"
---
Thats my personal perception on it and I will continue to voice my concern when people go far too far with their statement of systemic oppression in countries that by in large, dont have any. That doesnt mean those countries dont have idiots in them, that needs combated... but i still feel that accurate and well reasoned debate around the issues at hand helps to create a much more conducive and productive discourse for change.
---
I'm saying this as someone who was active in the gay rights movement from the 90's onwards... I can assure you the people who screamed oppression at every corner, were not listened too. They were dismissed as hysterical or proactively seeking victimhood... instead it was the centirc group of straight people and LGB people, working together, in a reasonable way with accurate and open communication that helped establish much of the ground work that our modern day rights are built upon.
---
I'm not being mean about taking the T out there by the way, but its just over in europe the transgendered community, were not a massive element of the gay rights movement of the 80's and 90's... The transgendered community became more of a consideration and an element within the debate within the past 20 years and Q is a relatively recent addition to the rainbow alliance, which forms our community.
---
How was the roadmap lame explain this to me. My understanding is a road map tell us what is coming which they did. They told us episode 6 was coming, season 5 was coming, wing 7 was coming and whats coming in the future. What did you want them to give you a date for every release.
---
Good thing then that I didn't say S5 was started after the layoff isn't it.
---
" S5 will (probably) be first content worked on since the layoffs and shake up". Also technically wrong again. Episode 6 would have been the first.
---
Yep, for a long, long time basi Venom didn't work on the sacrificed dude. I kinda think it was fixed some months ago ? I vaguely remember a patch mentioning some spells now work correctly on Mathias (mesmer's moa was one of them IIRC) but I'm not sure about basi venom.
---
Yeah, I agree. It would make sense from a Personal Story lore/immersion point-of-view for you to be able to wear the Order weapons and armor from the level where you become a part of that Order.
---
Especially because the equipment is Rare, and at level 80, you will probably prefer to start working on Exotics. They are limited on the stat choices, and a bit expensive for a new player doing the grind and Story for the first time.
---
I've been doing the Order backpack collections from HoT, and one of the requirements is to have all the Order skins unlocked for each respective Order. 
---
If we were able to start collecting them at level 40, I'd probably have all of them by now, considering I have at least 2 chars on each Order, possibly 3 - I have 1 char of each class.
---
I also agree with ranked PvP, it's lowkey a super strong money maker.
---
I just don't trust eggs.
---
Grieving Firebrand is really strong, and a lot of fun. Good mix of both power, and condi (which is really nice whenever you need to do something in core Tyria) and you get near-permanent fury, as well as good breakbar damage.  It can definitely solo champs, though it requires a lot more effort and practice than your standard open world facetanking builds.
---
Leveling to 80 in GW2 is really just the game's tutorial and is very fast, which is quite different to most MMOs. This is why most items that have some special skin bound to them are just implemented as lvl 80 equipment, because the character level really doesnt matter too much in this game..
---
Any particular reason you are technically nitpicking my words vs the message I am conveying?
---
Because facts are good things. You are wrong about season 5 being the first content that would have been episode 6 as that was still in development when the layoffs happen.
---
Yep, if only they did this or that, 7 years ago. It's too late now, the game is what it is now, so by definition, *HoT is/was too hard.* Your argument is essentially "if we go back in time and completely rebuild GW2 open world from the ground up, before anyone has a chance to play it, then we can build a playerbase that won't think HoT open world is hard." You're on the same level as the people who want ArenaNet to delete raids, it's just total fantasy.
---
Whereas my argument is "for the current state of the game's open world, HoT is a considerable difficulty outlier and does not fit in with the rest of the game as it is. 7 years down the road is too late to overhaul the game's open world to globally challenge players more, so HoT is the problem, not everything else."
---
I mean there's three easy bosses there: eyes, pukey, and burger king.
---
I do. I'm a loner even in gaming, I don't play to form bonds, friendships or become part of regular groups, my schedule doesn't allows it either and I'm way younger than most MMO players (considering I'm not that young to begin with), which makes it harder to have stuff to talk about.
---
Ironically, joining a guild in this game is what let me meet my wife lol.
---
I mostly build my characters for solo play. I've mained Minionmancer Reaper for ages and it's allowed me to complete all story mode dungeons and expansion maps on my own (included Balthazar in Auric Basin).
---
OFC I play Fractals and Raids whenever I can, but I'm not interested in forming part of a regular group.
---
Unfortunately, this is just the qay.
---
I see another users' got u. I'm not lgbtq+ nor do I know anybody who is so I'll leave it to the specialists to explain it.  
---
I only know that being gay isn't a disorder, I don't know anything about gender dysphoria etc.
---
Ye i ment the Pips.  
---
Thanks for the correction
---
This is anecdotal, but i've been raiding with a small guild for a year, and we've only ever done w1-4.
---
I think the main reason people don't do it is because the liquid gold per hour is less than even SW RIBA farm unless you have a Snow Crows-level optimal speed clear group. It's not bad gold for mere mortals especially with ascended drops, but it's not great. That makes the only incentive legendary armor and ring, which is a one and done (relatively speaking, still takes some LI, but not much).
---
I'm at \~70 LI, but I feel like the raid community moved on a couple years ago, except for a week or so after a new release, because there's not much to keep them coming back.
---
No, sorry, I'm just gonna to block you for real this time just because you're just stupid. You're basically saying that if someone was bad at maths when he/she was 8 y/o then they gonna stay bad at maths forever. Instead of crying doom and gloom, anet should get their asses back to work and fix the damn game. It would be too late if they'd just never added open world content again and we know thats not the case because otherwise how'd they make money with current state of the game lmao. Hire some intern to design and craft proper teaching system (like the one who made the snowman lair) and give people somy shiny skins for going through it, then take next LS and increase difficulty episode after episode so people can get used to it. Story episodes are already mostly instanced so its even easier to make it like 3,4 or 5 man. Like it's not some fucking rocket science, anet could have done it 2 living world seasons ago if they would want to.
---
Also there was [fuckery](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aktctr/more_information_on_arenanets_mistake_in_april/) about them leaving a blank line in their list of programs they would ban for. So if they looked at your processes, and saw a blank entry (which appears when someone on another login on that computer had something open) it would ban you. 
---
A user had to fight and fight and discover that (Thanks to GDPR) while being stonewalled constantly through support and at one point, forbidden from talking to them. Took almost a year to get it acknowledged. So many others were falsely banned for a mistake on anet's part. They got the LS episodes they missed and 2500 gems in return. Whoopity doo.
---
Make sure you both land on worlds of same *region* - the exact world doesn't matter but region does as EU players can't see nor play with NA players.
---
When I look at crafting I have 2 different of every exotic back piece I can make. Both have the same recipe and name, why are there 2?
---
Going up in a green isn't relevant to the challenge of the Dhuum fight, it's keeping the schedule straight while dealing with other mechanics. The pre event is long but a good run at Dhuum will still be shorter than 7m and when training newbies at Dhuum the pre-event actually does help players get comfortable with just how much movement they'll need to use for the encounter.
---
Spaghetti
---
politics in games are so damn stupid.  just play the game no one even know's if you're gay or straight. who cares?
---
It‚Äôs... interesting. My friends never liked the game but I loved it, playing as an engineer it was the perfect fit for my gaming persona and ever since then, on quiet weekend nights I have been playing. It‚Äôs one of the only games that truly feels like childhood, playing by yourself, absorbed in the adventure with no interruptions or distractions. All the more it makes those interactions with players that more interesting and rewarding, players can never be predicted because everyone has there own state of mind and way they play. Guild wars is something I‚Äôm glad to be apart of, even if I‚Äôm the only one in the squad.
---
that whole east side was not there during Pre-PoF and HoT days lol they recently added that. So im assuming next expansion will be over on the East side instead of in Cantha. Probably have some cantha parts but maybe this will be entirely new land.
---
I'm still having intermittent disconnects here on NA.
---
I've tried to defend the Pact camp in the Silverwastes during the "Pact Assaulted" quest about four times in the last hour and I get disconnected at random points during the mission.
---
I'm not sure of it doesn't work due to a bug... but I wouldn't use it anyways due to mechanics. Any cleave that hits Matt will consume your Basi stack, so even if it *can* hit the sacrifice, it probably **won't**, at least not reliably with all 5 people.
---
Don't worry about ascended gear it's a waste of time unless you're doing tier 4 fractals. 
---
You'll spend so much time trying to get it that it will burn you out. 
---
You'll find that you'll slowly get bits of ascended armor working your way up to actually use it :)
---
&gt; And by now the Skyscale rage is over!
---
No it isn't.
---
I can't wait to see pugs wipe 24/7 trying to do this.
---
The first ability, looking at the top card of your library, doesn‚Äôt use the stack. You can just look at the top card whenever you want.
---
The second ability lets you play the top card of your library, but it doesn‚Äôt change any timing restrictions, so you can still only play it in the usual times when you could play such cards out of your hand, which would be in your main phase (unless the top card of your library has Flash).
---
Everything is political to some degree, to think otherwise is naive.
---
Since when do you make the rules on how people can decide to play a game?
---
The world matters if you want to play WvW with your friend later
---
Pedro just staring off into space thinking "Wow told him they had magic loot inside of them and he killed them... have I found a minion".
---
I for one am really happy with the deimos fight. I love hand kitting.
---
Isn't it also usually cheaper to ecto gamble until you get the tarrktun or sandstorm item than it is to buy a merchant contract? Or do those merchants not have the standard merchant tab
---
EU LFG is brimming with groups as evident on EU streams. Can't attest to the quality of those groups, but at least the quantity is good.
---
Thank you, Silver!
---
So far about half of the Site is still witchcraft to me, but you and the guys from the economy discord taught me things - including this - with which I made roughly 20k gold so far... So thank you very much
---
I almost feel it's more risky *not* killing the anomalies with fire in my experience.
---
Episode six had already been underway a long time at that point, no?
---
I blame the lack of traditional questing. It's far more constructive than the instanced story missions we have here, which always feel so detached from the map's flow of events.
---
Still, the major problem with GW2's story is the bullshit "you're the superhero and the center of the world" model, which always leads to failure, even faster when applied to multiplayer games.
---
We should be nobodies, and our friends should be part of the story on their own way, instead of clones of the same character we're supposed to represent.
---
As I've said many times in the past, GW2 is closer to Marvel and Transformers movies, than to Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter.
---
Adding on as someone who mains DH in PvE, Guardians innately have access to a crapton of active defenses. One DPS util can be swapped to give more aegis. Your heal skill should be LoW which lets you facetank for a whopping 25% of damage dealt (which allows me to maintain dps uptime regardless of what an open world throws at me in 90% of the time.
---
Power does NOT die faster, /u/hinawerdan. Someone can run pure raid glass cannon with scholar runes in open world and still be fine.
---
May I recommend my friend, Strax. Her commission page on tumblr is here: https://wintrwulf.tumblr.com/commission 
---
Can see more of her work here: https://wintrwulf.tumblr.com/tagged/my-art 
---
She's a lovely gal and I love watching her art collection grow &lt;3
---
That is true, I didn't think about bounties, since I tend to do those in big runs. Some combinations can really be backbreaking.

&gt;The Dragon Bash festival begins tomorrow, so let‚Äôs warm up with a rousing rendition of the festival theme song, ‚ÄúBash the Dragon‚Äù! You can find revelers singing an updated version of the song in Hoelbrak‚Äôs Great Lodge during Dragon Bash.
---
&gt;The recorded version of the song is performed in English by ArenaNet employees (including our Localization Team) at our Bellevue, Washington studio. We‚Äôve uploaded the instrumental track to our [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/arenanet) and translated the lyrics into all our officially supported languages.
---
&gt;We‚Äôd love to experience your rendition of ‚ÄúBash the Dragon,‚Äù whether you‚Äôre singing solo, signing, or joining the chorus with your friends. Tag [@GuildWars2](https://twitter.com/GuildWars2) on Twitter so we can share it with the community!

&gt;#### ‚ÄúBash the Dragon‚Äù Lyrics
---
&gt;This world has lived in shadow from a pair of demon‚Äôs wings,
---
&gt;But none here fear the future or the darkness that it brings.
---
&gt;The monster puts on quite a show, expecting us to yield,
---
&gt;But there‚Äôs just one course of action when we take up sword and shield‚Ä¶
---
&gt;BASH THE DRAGON! SMASH THE DRAGON!
---
&gt;Drive it right back into its den!
---
&gt;May it never rise up again!
---
&gt;We send our best and bravest to attack with all their might,
---
&gt;The skillful and the willful each line up to join the fight.
---
&gt;The beast may leave corruption in a swath across the land,
---
&gt;But we won‚Äôt leave it breathing when our heroes make a stand‚Ä¶
---
&gt;Minions come in dozens from the peaks and from the shore,
---
&gt;But we face each wave with bravery and we‚Äôll never lose this war.
---
&gt;In every brawl a few may fall but more will join the queue,
---
&gt;and if that lizard shows its head then this is what we‚Äôll do‚Ä¶
---
&gt;We wake from every nightmare and adapt to what we‚Äôve learned,
---
&gt;It won‚Äôt be long until our place in legend has been earned.
---
&gt;The creature grows in power but it‚Äôs not in us to flee,
---
&gt;So when they ask who‚Äôll join the charge on this we all agree‚Ä¶
---

---
Hi jpredd. Good thought. 
---
I do agree with you that CMs should be extremely challenging to create happy players. With the current rewards of CMs, I can justify the incentives (guarantee exclusive boss loot, achievements, and titles). 
---
Possible mechanic spoiler below. 
---
My favorites among the current CMs that I like is Samarog CM, Deimos CM, and Dhuum CM. With the CM activated, players have to come up with new strategies to deal with mechanics in a more engaging and attentive manner.
---
Samarog CM - players must precisely consider their movement, dodge, and stability mechanics. It is very punishing on failure. I remember when my group first did this. We had so much fun together figuring out what worked best for this boss, and we thought this was a real fun challenge to master.
---
Deimos CM - players must keep Sal healthy at all times and it removed the cheese that players can simply outheal (good) Sal and ignore Pride/spirit mechanics. It also demands more movement strategy over noncm, and took away the massive DPS buff.
---
Dhuum CM - a simple mechanic added - Ender's Echo that will always haunt players who are not attentive of their environment. Notable DPS check is also more demanding.
---
Aw this is cute but I have the voice of nails being raked against a chalk board so I'll save the singing to better talent! Lmao
---
Interesting, then your compurer must be enormously expensive, only to show more players than you can count. (Or you can't count that good ;) )
---
Okay, but it's not like the restructuring really could shape that project.
---
any djinn + phase shift =_=
---
why
---
We did the safer strat, worked fine, looking forward to trying the other one, it's a neat idea
---
That sweet look of relief once it was off was adorable!
---
Been playing since the games launch. Have a level 80 of every class. I've played the game 95% solo. Friends are too into WoW, wife wasn't interested, so I been soloing any content possible for years now. Mostly do sPvP, events, currency farming. Rinse and repeat. It's fun, don't get me wrong, but it's a different kind of existience in the game world. But with the way events are structured, I'm never really alone. Just wish I was better at converting these strangers I meet into friends.
---
5 years I still haven‚Äôt leveled up my medium armor craftinglol 
---
I made 6 sets of ascended one for each class of the 6 xD. Works just fine
---
The issue is that W7 is by all accounts a pretty decent wing, a bit too easy imo, but it's not terrible -- the problem with W7 is that for how long it took to produce, it's terrible in terms of value. Like you said, if we were getting a raid similar to W7 in terms of difficulty every 3-4 months, no one would complain, but then we're waiting nearly 8-9months and we get something that has all achievements completed in less than 5-6hrs after waiting 9months then it's a huge problem.
---
Well, by "would not work" I did not mean that it is not possible to play in such way - I tried hybrid Ranger myself and it worked quite well for me (in open world, of course), - but just that such builds are weaker than pure power or condi ones. Which you confirm: "Hybrid Weaver is significantly weaker than power" and "hybrid reaper is weaker than power". Hybrid firebrand may be an exception, although I'm not that sure it is "stronger than condi" even solo / open world (where conditions are generally weaker that power damage).
---
Some of you guys are being too harsh and critical.  It's just a fun thing someone did.  Stop taking it so serious. lol.
---
I think I went to 4 fractals in total.
---
I never went to raids.
---
my guilds are often doing end game stuff, but since I still don't understand how to be a good dps, I don't want to be a bother and just pass on all of those.
---
So I just teleport around, doing meta, events and gathering to craft stuff.
---
Don't have a fullbody example for charr, but I do have a couple of busts I've done while trying to emulate GW2's style. [1](https://66.media.tumblr.com/de9f6b33bf28f042db6f1199a7d7645e/tumblr_nv1hgcK3W91re0v7vo1_1280.pnj), [2](https://66.media.tumblr.com/b627e8cd51258ecb81c50872f87b2942/tumblr_nuy0iqDLws1re0v7vo1_r1_1280.png) and [3](https://66.media.tumblr.com/727d3b6645f5f2effb1a696ef0cc0c05/tumblr_nuy0iqDLws1re0v7vo2_1280.png). PM me if you're interested.
---
All of those builds are as good or better than at least one of the pure builds.
---
You are welcome ;)
---
Do we know whether LWS5 masteries will use PoF mastery points and experience, or be a different region with its own mastery points and experience? I want to know if I should continue stockpiling Casino Coins to eat.
---
Talk about a bad case of helmet hair.
---
I think you're talking about the same playstyles, with your suggestion being more focused on dps. If your group manages to stay inside the wells and you do your rotation correctly, it should be fine. With fights  being chaotic this is often not the case, so it makes sense to play safe and focus on boon duration, especially when just starting out with the class.
---
I agree now it's a pretty good time, gems haven't been this low (125g for 400) in a while, even the 3 days BL key sale didn't drive price much higher. 
---
I think it's because they released lots of in game legendaries in the past little while, so a lot of people did gem -&gt; gold, driving the exchange down, while the gemstore item offerings themselves haven't been particularly demanding. 
---
With August and the anniversary sale coming, it's probably going to go back up to 140/150g range soon.
---
It's not hurting anyone.
---
Though.. on a more personal standpoint, whenever they join my raid groups in pug, I think to myself: "WTF, why is this person talking in third person acalling themselves kitty. We're in a raid here. Stop trying to be cute. I'm busy trying to command here. Grow up, it's annoying."
---
Then when they don't listen, I think to myself: "Wait a minute.. does this person have issues?"
---
Then I take a step back and realize: "Holy shit. They're serious. Maybe we shouldn't be making fun of people like this..."
---
Confirmed: Largos are angels of the deep sea
---
yah but you leave it up to chance and also to ecto gamble, you first need to have the gold and ecto to start. However, ecto gamble is more convenient in the end tho. You can use while moving and wont summon a merchent that others can see but cannot interact.
---
How are the colors different from your usual gw2 zerg anyway?
---
I seem to recall that you do get an item which contains a list of items you can select from, so you can at least get one. For the others, you out level that gear fairly quickly, and the Faction equipment were early prestige equipment in the game's history, so in a way it'd make a but of sense to save it for level 80, rather than unlocking it much earlier.
---
If you want to compare it to the cultural armour they skip right to T3 with no lower tiers available.
---
100% pug here. I'm only missing Dhuum and Qadim W6 (because I couldn't play around release and lost the chance to get KP). 
---
I play pvp, got to plat II my highest rating. 
---
I play WvW, nearing rank 300 (only played for like 2 months) 
---
I play open world .. if I count with the 8K I still need from dailies I'm nearing 30K achievement points. 
---
I play fractals (haven't actually played fractals for many months now but thats because I don't have any thrive for it no more)
---
You can play everything .. its fine.
---
I mean not in the traditional sense, but I would argue that the scavenger hunt itself qualifies as a grind. If I'm doing something I wouldn't normally do (run around to random places on the map for no apparent reason), it isn't particularly interesting or engaging (I tried doing it based on hints like was probably intended, but after the 80th scavenger hunt location it had long since lost its charm), and it takes more than a normal day's game time to reach the next forced stopping point (some steps over 3 hours even with a guide), I consider it grinding. It's one thing to make you work for the mount, but "go pick up random garbage for 30 hours" was probably the least interesting way they could have done it.
---
I bought them too.
---
They help me remember the days I played Guild Wars 1 as a kid.
---
I can understand the disappointment for sure. I agree with others that it is extremely unlikely to change.
---
I think the way to understand why this is the way it is would be to think about it in terms of the way the game was at launch. Originally, these were intended to be sortof like a perk that went with your choice of order so that at level 80 you could get some relatively affordable higher tier (rare) armor as a first set so you could get into end game content. In fact, although it might not seem like a big deal now, back in 2012 I think that the average level 40 player wouldn't be able to afford to 8.88 gold the set costs. I remember in 2012 when I hit level *80* I felt super rich when I opened an unidentified dye and it was worth a whopping 5 gold. Money was worth way, way more back then.
---
The other thing is that I think they had originally intended the order you chose to be a significantly greater factor in end game content moving forward. It's not 100% irrelevant after the personal story is over, but it's not nearly what I think they expected, so the idea was probably that this armor skin would have more meaning for some players well beyond once they hit level 80.
---
Everything is endgame content. Every single bit of game. So yes.
---
It will be communicated whenever it will be ready to be communicated. They said their long term plans and there is zero reason to think that it changed. 
---
Sidenote from me: Stuff will be developed as long as people will actively play it and like it. So if you want to have more raids, probably it is better idea to aim your energy towards new people and lure them into raids and cms, so Anet sees in their statistics that it is content worth expanding upon. That would be like.... 100x more helpful than some demands on reddit. Because so far statistics probably more show not very good reasons to continue with high-cost low-played content. Go for that instead and you will actually positively contribute.
---
angels are never outright stated to exist but some skills in gw1 reference them and then there's the "fallen angels" in ebonhawk. 
---
chances are angels are probably servants of dwayna
---
dropping fire to kill distortion is all fine and dandy until you're busy doing mechanics and didnt CC it the moment it spawns and now you have no room to get to it to cc it. Which is often my case when pugs drop fire trying to help me kill the distortion... when they just end up dropping 1 single fire and only give me very small window to cc and kill. 10/10 much rather fire against the wall.
---
Didnt she also look more like a harpy in some of the concept art in GW1 Elona?
---
Going along with this, the GW1:Nightfall manuscripts had this to say about harpies:
---
&gt;Some legends hold that the harpies were once beautiful winged creatures who proudly served [Dwayna](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Dwayna), the Goddess of the Air, until a catastrophic event cast them down from the heavens. 
---
That sounds specifically like angelic figures to me, so it's entirely possible that the Tyrian version of "angels" are now extinct.
---
Is a what? Isn't just that a risen mockery?
---
Sure we have some major EU guilds like AIR and TIME and then at NA times it‚Äôs like War and those guys so it‚Äôs pretty active at my personal time (
---
Basically I‚Äôm up early Am USA east.. so the guys I play with are mostly maybe afternoon and late afternoon EU time (I‚Äôm off before USA lunch time but I also know the server is even more active after I leave lol)
---
So it‚Äôs fun and you just have to find your own version of what‚Äôs ‚Äúbusy‚Äù and what‚Äôs ‚Äúfun‚Äù.
---
To me it‚Äôs plenty busy (with tags and active larger type guilds) and it‚Äôs plenty fun haha.
---
*I don‚Äôt run in those guilds because I play in a fight club so we run tagless 15 man havoc squad (small to medium size squad is my jam) So that‚Äôs just what‚Äôs ‚Äúfun‚Äù to me and everyone will have some different opinions haha (some guys love HoD and some hate it.. then there are the guys we basically farm who really really hate us hehehehe) 
---
And the WvWvW world keeps right on turning
---
KCs phantasms don't spawn until about 20 seconds into each phase meaning a boon thief will not provide any boons for a good 50% of the fight.
---
I am a WvW player and it's the only content that I do as a group (where our guild has 3 separate guilds to better spread claims). 
---
When it comes to the other content types I am 100% solo/pug, but I don't really play them that much.
---
Maybe not Orr, but RIBA is nice for flamethrower.
---
34 part video series, each covering 1 line
---
I have both ex-packs and enjoy playing my core-ranger through all story, and exploration as a self-sufficient player.  I've done this since the game came out. 
---
I enjoy chatting in the game with text, readily offering advice or a bit of help. I don't like discord because I don't trust the software and most people can't bear to let a silent period go unbroken. 
---
I get frustrated that invariably to start a group event it's like herding cats.  I play solo, because when I want to explore I often do it for 2-3 hours straight stopping when I lose momentum.
---
Si te interesa estoy en 3 guilds que s√≥lo hablan espa√±ol (na)
---
Given ghosts run the place, it's probably made by those ghosts in all honesty.
---
Never made much sense to me, tbh, that ghostly things would be part of the defenses of the estate (why would the estate even *have* such tricks and traps...).
---
Well hello there, guildie. I thought I recognized Norr's name.
---
we realistically wont get any word from them until a week after dragon bash, but actually realistically we wont get a shred of any amount of information until at least 3 weeks before season 5 launches
---
Oh, I'm not super familiar with MTG races. That IS clever then!
---
&gt;People are suggesting to make GW2 more like GW1
---
I loved GW1. I love GW2. They are not even in the same genre of gaming, so trying to make one more like the other is folly. To carry on the food analogy, if GW1 is a healthy salad and a reward for sticking to your diet, then sure, GW2 is a heart-cloggingly delicious meat feast pizza.
---
I love pizza. It's nice to gorge on stuff that's easy and mindless once every now and then.
---
GW1 is almost entirely designed around instanced group content. GW2 is almost entirely designed around drop-in, drop-out casual shits and giggles. We have room for both types of genres to exist.
---
Core Rev would be the best option if they added it to the core game. Since you need a expansion, might as well run Herald or Renegade.
---
Not really. The model was designed to be a risen largos, but that was never made canon, and the model repropriated to be used for the risen priestess of Dwayna and the statue of Dwayna twisted by Zhaitan's corruption.
---
Zommoros is expanding the brand?! But I thought Kralk was gone!!
---
I think the word is neurodivergent - if you're referring to people with sensory needs btw
---
That's the issue I have, I follow all instructions perfectly and I can't get the text to come up. Same with mount radial
---
Both are used.
---
Oh trust me I turned that garbage off day 1
---
It's a risen largos model, which someone decided to recycle for Dwayna's priestesses and statue.
---
This happened to over the course of like a year. I started ecto-gambling and lost 3000G which I worked very long for. After that I lost interest in playing the game on a daily base and only logged back in for the living world, which is a shame because I loved raiding and was part of a really cool guild. 3 weeks ago I tried again with the 500g I had and lost everything again. :(
---
Harder to learn raids from just pugging, but once you get some KP most tags will give you a shot for clears.
---
Yeah I did all of that, the installation is the easiest I've ever done but it still won't come up with the black box. :(
---
&gt; Anything else you'd like to know about me, before trying to defend the atrocious eyesore characters?
---
Yeah, why do you try to count players with infusion in zergs instead of playing the game? I mean even if they are full of infusions they don't really stand out in zergs nor in bossfights. So for counting them, you have to search for them. Why so much effort only for complaining?
---
Well you‚Äôre also losing on DPS by focusing soley on boons though. Most pugs can manage to stay inside the wells, assuming they‚Äôre *well*(badum ts) placed. I‚Äôd say it might be up for personal preference, but disctretzie is also the best of the best so I put my trust in the meta.
---
Most likely servants of Dwayna, just like Grim Reapers were represented by Grenth's servants.
---
Hope we get an "angelic avatar" elite specialization for the guardian some day.
---
Forced to play something other than chrono? What?
---
No, that's incorrect. Neurotypical means someone who is not handicapped, does not have sensory needs, no mental illness. Neurodivergent is someone who is divergent from the norm, meaning they have either a mental illness, special needs, or otherwise. 
---
I am heavy, heavy into the ND community for over a decade. Neurotypical means "normal" (for a lack of a better term) to most people. This has been decided on long ago and isn't something you can really argue the definition of.
---
Canthan love best love.
---
Kurzick painter though, so I'm afraid that's a 9/10. The Luxon send their regards, tree-huger.
---
Guardian is "meta af" for fractals and very good for open world and raids.
---
You can play dragonhunter (DPS) or power quickbrand (hybrid support). Both use GS!
---
The point of making GW2 more like GW1 isn't about more instanced content. It's about having a difficulty you overcome as a group.
---
GW2 has so much potential, and an amazing combat system. The meta event system means you're forced to coordinate with completely random players and formulate a strategy on the spot given the builds they all bring. 
---
But that potential isn't really bring tapped into.
---
In 2019 players aren't actually playing the game. They're running pressing F on objects for the skyscale collections or autoattacking giant pinatas.
---
Kind-of? 
---
I've been in an active guild since launch and I participate/communicate, but I've never really made friends. I've also made a few solo friends, and had a few real life friends come and go.
---
It's not bad, unless I want to RAID. Hard to pug RAID groups as a total neophyte. Pugs are demanding and intimidating.
---
Berserker/warrior longbow seems to be exactly what you are looking for.
---
Well, it says Zommoros is expanding *his* brand...
---
...is Zommoros secretly another crystal dragon?! Are there two Brands in Tyria and none of us realized it until now?!
---
Guardian seems just all around every elite spec amazing for world vs world.
---
Brand awareness saves lives!
---
Is the card good?
---
Yes, I exist.
---
Hmmm... Maybe you‚Äôre putting it in an older download of GW2? Like you‚Äôre running it from your SSD but putting it on the older version on an HDD? Idk. Alt shift H also hides and unhides it.
---
We need raid exclusive mount skins, that would help with the player numbers. Or just anything at all. 2 or 4g/boss is worthless, the players need exclusive loot.
---
Trust me. Killing the Distortions with fire is sooooo much easier because you don't have to constantly pull DPS off Qadim. Just send your BS over to the distortion, let him/her CC the distortion and be done with it. OP's sage option actually works well in pugs, so long as everybody knows their assigned drop locations‚Äîjust place markers on drop locations and issue assignments in the squad message. As for the risky strategy, it could work in a very organized group, but I would avoid using it in pugs‚Äîtoo much room for errors for comfort.
---
Nah. She only had wings. No harpy arms and legs.
---
CMs are a joke now. They made CMs and they are afraid of turning up the difficulty, like using insta-death fields. CMs should be elitists only, and with exclusive loot, and everybody would be happy.
---
There are structures/obstructions in the fighting pit? The guild hall I use to test out builds vs my boyfriend is 100% free of obstructions (Gilded Hollow). How is LOS being obstructed for the ranged character?
---
They're detachable?!
---
Well, if nothing happens, at least one of them has wrong build. There is quite a lot of stuff how to advance against ranged classes. Stealth. Reflects. Blocks. Teleports, blinks, leaps...
---
Just pop up the reflects and come out of hiding, if ranged person is okay to get everything back into his face, let be it.
---
High-quality avatars on a low-quality forum.
---
Damn I got the songs wrong. Of course this is a version of fear not this night and not dragon bash. I immediately thought you meant that song because it's the only one with a hill billy version.
---
patience is a skill, if you don't have it your opponent will try to exploit it for his/her own benefit.
---
but seriously it is a situation where both sides can argue that they are in the right so unless there are ground rules to deal with this situation from the start you won't get anywhere
---
I really hope that it is only the cap of 168 LI &gt; LD for those who killed bosses. Not just an unlimited exchange for any LI. Call me an elitist, but I don‚Äôt think exchanging Escort LI for LD is appropriate.
---
&gt; [...] and we are **not** planning to remove it again.
---
just to make the actual update part easier to spot.
---
I'd make them Gods, not Planeswalkers. https://mtg.gamepedia.com/God 
---
And specifically, I'd make them Theros-like, eg, not creatures unless you hit certain requirements, given how distant they are. Except Path of Fire Balthazar; I'd make him Amonkhet-like, though I'm not sure what his activation key would be. 
---
Think you're spot on with the colors though. Abaddon is also colorless (or maybe B/U) (if I were giving Kormir colors I'd call her U/W)
---
This is silly. All ranged builds have some form of AoE damage, forcing the meele player to choose between engaging or slowly die to AoE.
---
Besides, a meele player should always have the upper hand on the arena since it's easier to catch up than to run away.
---
great, if this is tomorrow with festival patch i can finally finish my ring
---
You need to stand in the brush near them to be stealthed before using an AOE skill on the prairie dogs.  Took me a few months to learn this..
---
Teq, fractals, daily pvp, daily home.  
---
Sleep, repeat.
---
Because there are 3 builds for chrono: Power, Hybrid(support) or tank. That‚Äôs why you need to be specific about it compared to something like Druid where there‚Äôs basically just 1 stat that‚Äôs viable.
---
"Safe" Yet pugs still constantly die to fire at 40% 30% 20%. Because they refuse to stand opposite from where boss is detonating, so they fail to dodge/stab and end up in the lava. When all it takes is stand on the line opposite form the boss, and you will never die even if you don't dodge at all.
---
nobody asked you lmao
---
This card is functionally very similar to another card, [Experimental Frenzy](https://scryfall.com/card/grn/99/experimental-frenzy), which has seen play in [Modern Affinity](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/1409455#paper), so it‚Äôs definitely got potential.
---
Layering all his voices: from random Internet nerd, to skritt to quaggan
---
Die, groundling!
---
I remember you from the WP sea of sorrows contest. Awesome
---
just die to mines so you can afk
---
&gt; Players not in your party afaik can not be tracked in anyway.
---
For clarity, its not that it can't be done, but that anet's stance is that "combat data" should only be gathered from your party/squad.
---
My headcanon for my older charr is that their natural horns eventually were removed and sockets built into their heads so they can switch between sets of prosthetic horns. I have the permanent hairstyle kit, and some hairstyles and horn styles/sizes are incompatible, so I just came up with this to justify it in a roleplay setting. Being able to style your hair for occasions is nice for every race, it's just harder for charr because clipping, as usual.
---
#  NOBODY CARES
---
i played almost daily for about a year and a half just getting as many achievements as i could, after that i kinda just come back occasionally to for events or updates if laptop can handle it (one day it just started freezing in game / lagging)
---
 ive only joined with 1 or 2 story missions for achives and for a while i did pvp for dailes but gave up on it
---
None are too hard to get silver at, to be honest. I think I got gold at Salvage Pit first time, though. 
---
If you need to get mastery points in a hurry, you can get about five or six in an hour by working through the adventures and aiming for silver or gold.
---
[My neighbor Pedoro!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvYgvm7zXK0)
---
Will definitely check that out, thank you very much.
---
You're not understanding what I'm saying. 
---
There are three main chrono builds:
---
* boon chrono (diviner gear, ie this "hybrid" build)
---
* tank chrono (added toughness as necessary, commonly commander gear)
---
* power dps chrono
---
When you call the normal everyday chrono build (diviner) a "hybrid", you cause confusion, because people are wondering what it's a hybrid of. It isn't a hybrid of power chrono and boon chrono. It's literally just boon chrono. 
---
I think your misunderstanding stems from believing that tank chrono is the default and more common build. It isn't. Regular old diviner chrono is the vastly more common, default build.
---
Ehh... there were whole chunks of the map that were finished, but otherwise unpopulated that were acceddible by tricky jumping, logout-exploits, and Thief teleporting. The outspoken consensus was that they were really cool curiosities of the maps, and not "there's nothing to do here... wehh." I mean, you can't even *get* to most of those without really trying, even when mounts came out.
---
Meanwhile there are huge gaps in the geometry and collision of the main areas of some maps (a pile in HoT alone) that are very easily accessible by accident. 
---
&gt;and filly up reddit with "why is there nothing to do in these areas? why is ANet so lazy!"
---
Can you point me to posts that complain about the hidden / unifinished areas for *being* boring/unfinished, rather than "why did they block this off"?
---
unlikely, since you can buy anything it drops at raid vendors (and the infusion drops from the new raid too)
---
Meanwhile, Planeswalkers I'd make from legendary Mists travelers, like [Lord Odran](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Lord_Odran), or even Mad King Thorn. 
---
Classes I think are best represented by deck archetypes. Lessie...
---
* Warrior: W/R
---
* Ranger: G
---
* Thief: B (/U?)
---
* Necromancer: B
---
* Guardian: W
---
* Mesmer: U
---
* Elementalist: U/R, but specifically based on instants &amp; sorceries 
---
* Engineer: Artifacts, potentially splashing many colors (a la the Kaladesh block) (but probably with a lean to U/R)
---
* Revenant: Color dependent on Legends equipped.
---
Legend colors: 
---
* Shiro: B
---
* Ventari: G
---
* Jalis: W
---
* Mallyx: B
---
* Glint: U?
---
* Kalla: R
---
And finally, common colors for each race...
---
* Humans: as usual, all of 'em
---
* Sylvari: Predictably they have a lot of G, but they can appear in all colors! Sylvari are very adaptable. Like, Canach is pretty clearly B; Scarlet was classic R/U artifice, Caithe is... prooobably B/U?
---
* Charr: Mostly R, W, U; have Colorless Vehicle artifacts. Despite what you'd think, there's not a lot of B here, because Charr have a VERY strong collectivist streak, they're all about militaries and building armies. Exception: Flame Legion is mostly B/R. (Ash Legion is mostly U, actually, being spies)
---
* Asura: classically R, U, and B. SCIENCE and MAGIC but also AMBITION AMBITION AMBITION. 
---
* Norn: G, R, W. 
---
That said, if I had to pick a SINGLE color for each race (since there's 5 and all...)
---
Humans: W
---
Charr: R
---
Asura: B
---
Norn: G
---
Sylvari: U
---
("wtf sylvari are u???" It's the ONE for EACH limit. R and W are obvious fits for the Charr (industry &amp; burning fire things!) and humans (classically W in MTG). I can't see U fitting the Norn at all, ever. The Asura are *extremely* ambitious above all else; while the Sylvari are driven by curiosity.)
---
The wording suggests it's almost certainly not in tomorrow's build, but there's always a chance it slipped in by mistake.
---
Yeah, I noticed the Mad King motif.. and figured, but didn't want to come out and say it! :P
---
&gt; With out mounts could you get to these places?
---
Yes, *especially* with the way logging out and back in used to work from a top-down elevation to spawn the characters (called something like "void jumping"?).
---
I can make a legendary armor with escort, spirit run and TC LI within one year. What now?
---
Yeah, I have ArcDPS disabled right now. I couldn't bother myself trying to figure out the issue. I'll just redownload it in a few days. That usually fixes the problem.
---
I've been part of so many guilds in both games over the last 14-15 years that it's kind of hard to try and look for one again. I had friends who played outside of guilds but over time either their interests shifted or theyve quit games altogether. I've been playing solo all but about a year of my gw2 time. I'm good at it, but it gets lonely.
---
Nice life-gain, apparently.
---
Awww and all caps too! Somebody trigger easily?
---
disaggree. i dont want to force people to run the wings they dont like. we allreaddy have a small raiding community, we shouldnt split it up by having not interchangable currency.
---
if you farm escort for 168 weeks that dedication! you deserve that ld! on the other hand. if you exchanged your 168 li allreaddy, just think about all these escort li's that you spent yourself. you should be forced to give back atleast 4-8 ld!
---
Regarding new content (not features) they said nothing new in the after lay offs roadmap. the stuff they confirmed was already announced in August 2018.
---
Dudes like this don't understand that pretty much any piece of media, video games included, are not apolitical. People like him are why the "wow cool robot" meme exists basically. And probably bitch about representation in video games constantly.
---
Stuff like this is great!
---
Warframe did Fortuna's Lift Together
---
Definitely the heart of the community in action
---
IMO there shouldn't even be a distinction. The only thing they're useful for is coalescence, and that requires you to clear wing 7 (thus being gated behind PoF as intended).
---
I mainly have this attitude because the 150 LD and 250 incense cost is very obviously representative of the content drought more than it is the actual value of the trinket. It requires as many boss kills as the full first set of legendary armour. Why?
---
Nice.
---
No, because people here love tengu and when tengu will be playable then they will cry that Fashion Wars is exactly the same like on Charrs. :)   
---
Sado-masochists.
---
What a strange thing.
---
Makes sense we have learned new stuff about the dragons since Zhaitan like we can't kill them unless something is there to take its magic.
---
It's difficult to understand them when they Suxon my Kurdick though.
---
Yes, I am aware however the spawn times on the adds make boon thief less than optimal (viable if you really push it). You can absolutely run it, but it isn't something to pull out in a pug which your post and builds appear to be aiming towards.
---
Pugs, and most statics, won't really entertain the notion of boon thief on KC since for a large portion of the fight, the boon thief is basically a lemon. By making the renegade push, you also won't have alacrity up the moment KC spawns.
---
I would personally be very surprised if this was anything close to the "meta" comp and even if it was, it isn't a useful compsition for the vast majority of groups. That isn't the case with other boon thief compositions which are far easier and more flexible due to how the bosses work.
---
I really like the ritualist on the right, would it be ok if I used it on here?
---
Nah all I said and what I actually mean is that a new game would require new stuff (engine for mmo) that today's videogames industry ecosystem is not interested because the public is shifting platform interests and revenues from MMO's are dropping as a financial model. If they would agree on making something new for gw2 it would be a new game. Probably shifting from MMO's. 
---
I spoke about possibilities not facts.
---
The first idea for the guild wars 2 story were fighting  angels and devils instead of dragons.  So at least there were angels in the guild wars universe
---
&gt; They just need to be immortal in PvE when they arent explicitly targeted.
---
All minions, and ranger pets already take 95% reduced damage when not explicitly targeted in PvE.
---
That's precisely what would happen. Another race with little to no population. Largos on the other hand.. who wouldn't want to play elf proper? Probably rival for humans.
---
I meant feel bad for you. Apparently reading comprehension isn't your forte.
---
The length of this guide is a testament to how ridiculous this grind is.  SMH.  And people can downvote me if they want but this is a billion fucking resources all being spent on acquiring ONE thing.  Every "step" doesn't make it feel like you're rewarded with anything.  This is poor game design, and why I probably won't go after this mount at all.  I didn't care for the gryphon, and while I like the look of the Skyscale, this grind makes it even less worth it.
---
And add in the audacity of releasing a 25$ skin for it, haha you gotta be fucking kidding me Anet.  I literally don't have any desire to play the game after just seeing this debacle.  As much as the story has improved in the past 2 years, I personally don't care to pursue the game further.  I've gotten to a stage in my life where I don't have the urge to play something that is this utterly disrespectful to a person's time.  What this game makes up for by being a one time purchase it completely fails with the time invested.  
---
Just my 2c, because I was finally feeling good enough to look up what was required for this mount thinking I could get myself to get it, and everything just suddenly clicked.  Hell no.  Hard pass.
---
Haha, explains the grumpy look. It's actually [Hao Luen](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Captain_Hao_Luen) though!
---
What if that only AoE is barrage?
---
uninstall anyways
---
I am a completely solo player.
---
  
---
I have been in more than a few guilds, but i mostly am pretty quiet or don't really talk a lot, but i do not
---
participate in guild made raids/open world PvE or fractals.
---
Honestly i have managed to achieve everything the game that offers, i have pugged my legendary armor, i have achieved good pvp rankings i have gotten numerous ascended sets just like most veteran players and meanwhile i had a blast.
---
What i must say is, this game would be much more fun with other players, i believe MMORPG's are not really meant to be played solo and im sure most will agree. Its nice that companies provide us a solo alternative, but having a group or a guild that you join and form bonds with, will make it a lot more enjoyable and make time fly on a different scale.
---
To this day i still play regularly solo, but im having plans to move to more group related style. Finding a guild to dedicate myself into, make more friends that i play with and form everlasting bonds like i used to in other MMORPG's i have played and my first game Ultima Online which is so memorable, only because i made great friends i played wiht every single day and had my back even when i lost all my gear!
---
Thanks for the great question!
---
Gilded hollow has a single pillar in the middle of the guild arena.
---
Ranger vs condi ele, getting close for extended period of time would be suicide lol.
---
They have absurdely long neck to store the horns like Wolverine do with his claws.
---
Happens often. Only solution is to wait. There's an automatic script that ANet runs every once in a while to "fix" these type of issues.
---
*Horses are absolutely fake* and anything else is propaganda and lies.
---
No.
---
First, story would be inconsistent
---
Second, remaking tons of armor pieces would take more effort than whole expansion
---
Vigilante Santa looks better than Recurring Anime Rival, in my opinion.
---
Fix your attitude
---
Fixed! It's 30th June. I'm dumb!
---
how is that gonna help? will it fix the fkin game?
---
I think they have been these 2 weeks thinking what to do with the exchange ( if it was temporary how much time and when to add it) and today they have made the decision to add again forever. So, probably they won't have enough time to add it for tomorrow patch, although I would like to be wrong. However, if not tomorrow I think we won't have to wait too much.
---
We going to cantha? :O
---
they're mostly cool now because they're mysterious
---
When I say I'll redownload it in a few days the key part of that is "in a few days". For one reason or another GW2 or ArcDps occasionally comes out with an update that makes the two together just plain not work on my computer. I'm going to try and see if everything works better after the Dragon Bash update tomorrow. I don't know if your problem is the same as mine but I figure it wouldn't hurt if you retried tomorrow after the update.
---
As a rule of thumb I think reconning shit is a bad idea. The little bit we have on the wiki is fairly clear why largos are not the ideal addition for a playable race beyond anything anet has already said on the matter of the next playable race. From the wiki "The largos purposefully do not interact with land-dwellers." I know this could change if we ever get bubbles or have content that focuses on being underwater but interacting with them underwater is different than them being a playable race that runs around doing hearts , killing dragons and what not.
---
I‚Äôm calling it a hybrid because the stats came out 4 years after chronomancer was released(compare HoTs release with All or Nothing release dates). It‚Äôs also called hybrid by discretize so I‚Äôm gonna go what they say.
---
if it makes people like you leave I would totally sign up to endure a PvP hiatus on the spot.
---
were you for any chance on the saturday fashion contest from the farming guild?
---
Have a service ticket.
---
Give them a rest, they just lost their gods, and the Vasburgs in particular had theirs killed by some rando asshat commander.
---
Nah this was just a small joke side project that I wanted to do, but turned out to be way too expensive to justify the pay-off.
---
&gt; ...I started a real discussion with you...
---
Exactly who are you fooling? Yourself?
---
I'll play around with it thanks
---
&gt; Tengu have to go first and they qualify in all aspects to be a playable race. They have been waiting for much longer.
---
Just getting getting a tengu map would be enough. Like we have killed 3 elder dragon the tengu could be like yea you all are pretty cool and there are less dragon minions around (thanks for that) we could try to be less isolationist and more friendly now. They could even double down on the charr/human conflict and be all like see we used to be sworn enemies and we now travel freely in each other lands, come lets all be friends or something.
---
I was hoping someone that ventured into official forums to survive and tell their story but looks like it was only known to creative partners.
---
the other player also couldn't draw any lands, obv
---
Exactly. We can't kill them, but we can find ways to replace them. To be fair glint already knew this before the game even began. It was her plan for kralk since before the book "Destiny's Edge"
---
What if player has F5 broken
---
I'm glad that there is an exchange both ways so you can progress on both legendary types from any raid
---
Just wish you could repeat the ring like legendary armor
---
Not bad. I made a griffon tutorial if you wanna learn a few tricks :3
---
 ‚ÄúDragons were not always the main antagonists of Guild Wars 2. According to The Making of Guild Wars 2 book, original drafts for story included demons and angelic beings descending to the world to judge it.‚Äù

Maybe we get something in future?

It's completely crazy that we still don't have that class.

Ah, you are at the "*this was never a real discussion*" point already?

I mean, regardless of how your opponent is doing, they've survived 20 to 50 damage depending on game format.

While I'm in a clan, I've never actually spoken to anyone and I just use the buffs. Other than that I've plaued completely solo for about 5 years now. No partys, no joining squads, no TP.

Is druid weaker than core ranger?
---
It's not precursor armor anymore
---
what's wrong with attitude? He can't play because ArenaNet has no Quality Assurance... it's totally understandable that he is mad
---
The power creep isn‚Äôt really that crazy over the years; it‚Äôs pretty comparable overall. It‚Äôs  like everyone forgets alacrity used to be 66% recharge reduction, GOTL gave 15% damage boost, it used to be possible to run 1 chrono for the entire 10 man raid, etc. 
---
The real reason raids are easier is the increase in overall player skill, the implementation of new strategies that are more effective than old strategies (takes time for people to figure out how to cheese mechanics/skip phases etc.), the addition of the DPS golem and ArcDPS, and much better resources for raiders to find optimal builds and meta compositions/guides for all bosses
---
The full list of stuff we know for sure:
---
* Not every chaoter will have a new map
---
The things we can probably guess:
---
* The first chapter will probably have a new map, as it has been in development since before the previous thing was announced.
---
Beyond that we know absolutely nothing.
---
Comparatively speaking, it's kinda like a 4th of July celebration. The last one we had was back during 2013 and it was in commemoration of the defeat of Zhaitan. It was held in Lion's Arch, but ended with the assassination of one of the members of the Captain's Council. Since then it's been held again until now.
---
During the event a projector was set up in the center that projected a big image of Kralk's Shatterer champion that flies around the skies of LA and gets taken out by fireworks. There was like wooden dragon targets, dragon decorations, dragon themed mystic forge, dragon pinatas, and that kind of stuff set up around LA. There was different achievements for like destroying dragon pinatas, killing the dragon champions in the world (Teq, Shatterer, and Claw were the only ones around at the time), Moa Races that you can bet on, two different holographic dragon wing backpacks you could earn, a dragon helmet you could earn, and a minigame arena called the Dragon Ball Arena (which got moved to the Lunar Festival in later years after).
---
It was visually a really nice looking event and (for their time) the rewards were pretty cool. I'm really happy to see it back. :)
---
And pet dies easilly?
---
Does it make sense? I don't know. Does it make sense that competing games charge $15 a month? You can get 7 years of Guild Wars 2 content for the price of half a years sub to pretty much any sub game. It's not pay to win. Games have to fund themselves, pure and simple.
---
So we're talking about what? A cup of coffee every two episodes. Somehow, I'm not thinking that's much of a barrier. Most people can afford LS episodes easily if they have a computer and internet connection, particularly since the current ones are free. And those that can't have the options of grinding gold.
---
Since only a percentage of players care about story anyway, and many got it free, I doubt it affects as many people as you think it does.
---
And I really miss them. The one for Kessex especially looked really distant and mysterious.
---
Oh yeah! Forgot about those. I farmed like crazy for the [Jade Sword](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dragon%27s_Jade_Lacerator_Skin). Loved that skin. xD
---
 condi scourge uses viper gear  , which has power, precision, condition damage and expertise so it's basically a hybrid already!
---
And then as the bunker ele condi's that one down while having free infinite heals?
---
I've gotten 160 LI so far, completely solo only from pugs, sometimes it's hard to get a competend group, but other than that it works just fine. All the other activities work fine solo too. I'm in a guild but just pure for chatting sometimes, only done guild missions once or twice, the rest LFG since start now.
---
This is why I keep telling people to stop calling that "Stat swap" and call it something else like "reforge".
---
This happening to one person is one person too many, but it happens to way more people than you may think. 
---
There's actually 3 ways to get different stats in gear:
---
* Stat swap. The item changes to different stats. **ONLY** legendary gear can do this consistently.
---
* Stat reset. The item loses its stats and you can pick new ones. This is only done after updates that change items with selectable stats and players can't do it. It's done by server scripts when you load each character. 
---
* What I call 'reforge'. The item is lost, destroyed, along any upgrades in it, and you get a new item. It happens in 3 ways: 
---
 * Weapon and armor Mystic reforge: You throw the weapon in the msytic forge along the corresponding materials and insignia/sigil, and you get a new one with the Crafting Discipline skins: Illustrius set for armors, and one of the Antique weapons for weapons.
---
 * Vendor reforge. This is exclusive to Caladbolg. You lose the item by using it as currency along 1000 volatile magic to buy a new one. 
---
 * Consumable reforge. This is exclusive to Mist trinkets from Fractals, WvW and PvP, and to Bloodstone Fen trinkets. You buy a consumable, use it, and it either reforges the item, or resets the stats of one of these items. It's buggy and inconsistent and it sometimes it actually resets the stats instead reforging the item, but it's better to stay on the safe side and always extract upgrades from trinkets before doing this. 
---
Following this terminology, what you did would be a "Mystic Reforge", not a stat swap.
---
You can call it 'exchange', 'reforge', 'reconstruction', etc.  
---
But I keep telling people to stop calling it 'stat swap', because it ain't swapping the stats, it's swapping the whole item for a new one, and if people keep doing that someone else will end up bamboozled too and lose an important item in the process and get a crappy illustrious/antique weapon in its place, or worse, an expensive infusion.
---
All you can do now is contact support and explain the situation, wait and hope for the bets.
---
And what ANet should do is changing precursor so they are no longer salvageable and so the only mystic forge for which they work is their legendary.  
---
That or adding a method to do actual stat swap for ascended when they add build templates.
---
go with power weaver, honestly, staff for open world or sword/dagger
---
the sword /dagger rotation is SUPER smooth, enjoyable and fun once you get the hang of it ( even a chump like me gets it down, not perfect but still 20k+ dps very easily) it's good. playing full glass ele will also teach you about positioning yourself better and dodge stuff. which is very good in itself!
---
Less geometry for the game to load.
---
What‚Äôs gw2 forums? We are the forum right here üòù
---
Fuck off!
---
I'd like to see profession-specific cosmetics, GW1 did that pretty well
---
It already is! Go check it out and pick your favorite!
---
ngl, i was kinda expecting/hoping for ~~~original~~~ real Lion's Arch to be there
---
As long as ArenaNet doesn't mind, I won't either!
---
&gt;Doing any stat-swap activity in the mystic forge will change the base item - this will prevent you trading it with Ridhais to unlock a different skin.
---
it won't let you stat swap caladbolg in the mystic forge.
---
Revenants got access to fire fields. Mace is for melee combat. If you wanna try range weapons: its elite spec Renegade can you use a fire based Shortbow and skills. Check out the wiki for more informations.
---
All my charr have no horns.
---
In regards to the armor and skins part, I would like to see maybe a new tier of Racial Armor or Weapons that people could work towards. Like they could take all the current ones and add on to them. Like maybe new style touch-ups or some glowy effects to them. 
---
A good kind of example of something they could do like this was in Master x Master (a former NCSoft game) with Rytlock's alternate Charr T3 skin - [Azureflame](https://masterxmaster.gamepedia.com/File:Skin_Rytlock_Azureflame.jpg).
---
AC 1-3, CM 1 &amp; 3, TA up and forward, SE 1 &amp; 3, CoF 1, HotW 1-3 and Arah 2-4. I hope that those are correct, I may remembered something wrong. Some paths are easier to solo than others. 
---
Overall you need very good knowlegde of your class, the mechanics and enemies in the dungeons, an optimized build for soloing and some consumables that help with skipping enemies or breaking cc bars. 
---
The best classes to solo dungeons (and any champion enemies out there) are power chrono, power reaper, power DH, spellbreaker and daredevil. Theoretically you can solo dungeons on any class but those are the easiest/most efficient at least from my perspective.
---
Sad truth
---
Go to game site, click support top right, sign in, submit ticket, choose game support, in reasons choose items or rewards then scroll to the bottom and choose "other", after that give as much detail as you can (what toon you were on, date, what precursor etc.) and wait til they contact you. If it takes awhile to get back to you **do not write another ticket,** that'll only push you back further in line.
---
Thank you! I submitted and hoping for the best :)
---
Well im retarded I never noticed that
