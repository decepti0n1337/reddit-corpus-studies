If you can access other people's nodes then why would you buy the Home Instance gemstore bundles?
---

---
They don't sell raid upgrades, so they don't care about raid selling.
---
They do sell Home Instance upgrades. Just sayin'.
---
---
---
Im expecting expansion level content at the very least and a promise of renewed focus on gw2. If its just the same formulaic content model that we've seen the last few years im over it tbh.
---
I would totally go for this
---
I don't mind the help but the shortage of mastery points that don't involve giant collections, random encounters that never spawn when you're waiting for them or raids means it just isn't going to help much...
---
Living the dream

This is unironically why I am looking forward to WoW Classic. I love MMOs but I hate spending a bunch of money on them when i go through a depressive episode . . .

You can do absolutely nothing and Healing Signet will still heal you. That is rarely ever the case for life steal in any game.

nicely worded

Maybe but using useless labels definitely is.

Cantha is a very hairy subject.
---
USA v. China for one with the Huawei and supposed spies incident.
---
Korea v. Japan is another.. stupid Abe Shinzo making unnecessary tensions, pulling a political stunt.
---
Also mixing Korean and Japanese names together, you'll get shot in the head. That's exactly what Cantha was doing.
---
Laughs in airships
---
Not really the correct answer. What is your CPU? (The main bottleneck in GW2)
---
Cantha should not return.. it's a very hairy topic and way too many things that can go wrong
---
GPUs have nothing to do with CPU bound scenarios like WvW
---
2v2 needs its own queue like Stronghold and it most likely will eventually. They have 3 maps now so they have enough for a vote. I expect another 2v2 tourny before then though.
---
Leyline gliding is specific content. Why can you learn that just by leveling up? Why not have to complete an adventure that has leyline gliding once you maxed out the xp bar?
---
Not really, it's possible to play it smoothly. It still requires an absurd computer for what it is, given shit optimization as you said.
---
Try an hexa or octocore with decent single core, DDR4 memory and D912PXY.
---
Actually, we have acknowledgment here from Dornsinger that raid selling IS NOT against the code of conduct
---
It is truly a culturally insensitive fantasy land.. me saying this as an East Asian
---
China v. USA is one
---
Korea v. Japan is another.. mixing names are taboo
---
I'm running an i5-8600K (along with a GTX1060 6GB and 16GB of DDR4 RAM, should be more than enough to run any recent and upcoming games smoothly) and still encounter frame drops in LA or while encountering farming zergs and whatnot.
---
Sometimes there's little you can do.
---
See, I'd prefer the party know what to do.  I'd prefer that to having a  tank and a healer carrying 3 other people who don't know what to do, who don't care to learn what to do. 
---
I'd also never want to be in a game where I had to wait for a healer or tank, when none were available, have to exclude a friend or guildie because he/she wasn't a healer or tank or, as happened to me in Rift, I'd never want to play a game where I was badgered into healing even though I didn't want to, because my guild couldn't find another healer. I wanted to play a DPS cleric and I was cajoled repeated into a role I didn't like to support others. I don't want any of that.
---
Now, we want to do a dungeon or fractal and a bunch of us can jump in and do it. Pick up and play. That's pretty important to me. Waiting for that one guy, or having to party with a guy I don't particularly like because he's the only healer or tank available at the time, terrible.
---
  
---
The thing is, healers and tanks all miss the trinity. DPS guys never do, and there are probably more of us than there are of you.
---
Yes its the same business model since GW1 and that was over 10 years ago.
---
A lot of mmos have 3 roles that classes typically fall into: tank, dps, or healer. GW2 was designed to do away with this formula. Despite this, raids have some pseudo tanking, and healer builds still exist in various game modes.
---
Count GW1 and its been that way for 14 years.
---
Good old vocal minority. Main reason why other things even outside of the gaming world gets a bad rep; from random yet small groups of asshats ruining it for the people who actually care about the thing in question.
---
Yep, and that's because I used the word "*Similar*" and not "*The Same*". ;)
---
Last time I read the law it was not.
---
Okay!  
---
1. Instant Leveling your first character is not recommended.  
---
2. Druid is an Elite Specilization which comes after the Core class.  
---
3. There is no Holy Trinity Roles (Tank, DPS, Support) outside High end Fractals or Raids.  
---
4. You can swap builds anytime.  
---
And 5. It is recommended leveling at least each character of each classes at least once before you boost.
---
There‚Äôs a different between ‚Äúbeing a casual player‚Äù and ‚Äúnot trying to get better at all‚Äù... I‚Äôm fine with casual players, I raid and do T4s but I only play 1-2 hours per day on average and love fashion wars and gemstore items as well...
---
WvW lags
---
1070s seem to have a problem with GW2.
---
That is all they are not supposed to be related points. I should have seperated them.
---
So I'm guessing you're not an optimist. lol
---
I really hope a new expansion
---
I don't think it makes the game better for a lot of reasons, that have nothing to do what we're talking about here. On the other hand, you do and that's fair enough. It's fine that we disagree. Not everyone is going to like the same thing. If a full fledged trinity was introduced throughout this game, I'd be playing some content a whole lot less.
---
The skill states the duration of the field and the pulse interval. With a duration of 3s and a pulse every second we get the stated 4 pulses. Each of those pulses will apply the damage and the poison and can apply the daze.
---
If an enemy exits a combo field they will not get not hit by the effects of the remaining pulses. However it does not effect the possibility to finish the combo, by using a combo-finisher. With the shortbow you can finish the combo with projectiles by shooting through the field or by using your second activation of the 2 inside the field for a blast-finisher which applies AoE weakness around the blast.
---
The red bar is a range indicator. It triggers when you are to far away, though I'm not sure how it applies to AoEs as they reach further than their range tooltip states, because of their radius.
---
I've had a very hard time getting MPs for core; I've been stuck for at least a year in core. Maybe make those a bit easier to get? How many other people are stuck like this?
---
I wish people would stop saying stuff like this. I'm not an open world farming bot, in fact, I generally detest farming. And I seldom buy skins in the gem store.  And yet I find stuff to do. Admittedly it's not stuff you like to do.
---
Achievement point hunters exist, as well as farmers. People who just like collections exist too. Roleplayers exist.  There are lots of people who spend time in the open world from casual players without much time, to guys like me, who have a different end game.  You can enjoy this game without spending money on skins and without being a farming bot.
---
They're functionally identical. You hit thing in face, you get HP.
---
It's going to be an expansion. Cool...
---
I'll be too busy playing classic to pay attention to your announcement, and the devs that you have left aren't good enough to make content worth coming back for.
---
Good for you guys though, gotta milk those last few dimes out of your remaining playerbase.
---
What is the better way of doing the amalgamated gemstone recipe, by 1s or 10s?
---
Well druid is just ranger with a few additional skills, So if you don't like ranger chance are you won't like druid.
---
Thanks, but as I said I'm not going to boost my FIRST character. I want to learn the game with anything and then boost to get the Druid. I know it comes after the Core class but It doesn't interferes with my wish to boost a Ranger in order to get Druid asap, right?
---
Less expecting, more hoping. Over half the players I run with are on hiatus over lack of content. I expect they'll be gone long-term, and a bunch more joining them, if this announcement is nothing but an over-hyped LS5.
---
popularity **on twitch**. not just regular old popularity. 
---
and i think you're taking me too literally. im not only talking about football. some games are actually very boring/repetitive to play alone (such as minecraft), so people prefer to watch other teams instead of trying to put together their own.
---
The limiting factor most of the time is the jewels, not the dust/ecto, so
---
10, it costs 75 jewels to get 10 gemstones, so 1/7.5 per jewel
---
1, it costs 9 jewels to get 1 gemstone, so 1/9 per jewel
---
So it's generally a better deal for you to create 10 at a time
---
Do not think it is much different or more common in Russian,  IMHO it's the same as in English mostly - *usually* it means two, but may be informally used for "a few" too
---
Oh boy.. Enjoy the show.
---
I respect the amount of time you took to write this, but no. The point is that it would be an ambient map for atmosphere and relaxing, not a map for metas or large events.
---
You're gonna have to give me a reason to give a damn enough to give whoever that is a view.
---
I too have the same dilemna as you. I love the druid theme, but the gameplay of rangers is on the bland and boring side, and while druid brings some utility qol, it doesnt do much to help the combat. When there is combat involved it does feel more of a chore than playing on other classes like scourge, revenant, or firebrand. I often wish I had mained other classes like scourge because of it, but I don‚Äôt want to start a new character.
---
That being said, the druid is my main class and I have done world completion on it and is what I use for content because of its theme and utilities. The druid brings a lot of qol like a projectile block, a long ranged dash, ease of useful boons, and unique buffs that make the class feel cool to play. So if you enjoy these things you‚Äôll do fine with druid.
---
You‚Äôre going to be missing out on a lot of utility if you decide to use bow with the druid however. Long bow doesn‚Äôt provide much, and short bow is good in a condition build, which loses a lot of utility. But if you don‚Äôt mind utility tradeoffs, go for it!
---
Now that i‚Äôve played other classes and everything, i don‚Äôt think its a bad idea to use the level 80 boost. I would actually encourage the use of the boost early so that you dont get bored out of your mind starting the game. You can totally just do low level content and story quests while youre 80 to practice your character and mechanics, and its more fun. Then while playing you can amass tomes of knowledge and gold to help instantly level any other characters you want to try down the road.
---
I dislike WPs, so I want to be able to get across Tyria without them. That's all.
---
He made a baitpost just to see these type of comments. I'm not surprised you not only fell for it but you're also making a case out of it.
---
Dude got buff.
---
Why not? there is many new players who want to take it seriously, because they have fun :)
---
It‚Äôs usual to feel like that, I personally love the handling of them and their animations. I know a lot of people despite doing jumping puzzles with them grahaha, I think it‚Äôs something you get use to overtime
---
It's like people think I don't know. lol
---
I'm well aware of that. But I'm always aware of how many people take everything literally. I don't always respond just for the OP. I respond because there are other people reading who might take it seriously. If you think that some casual players don't feel like they're under assault sometimes, I'm not sure what to tell you. I don't, but my skin is too thick for my own good.
---
I mean I don‚Äôt even understand why people do (or if they even do at all) pay for spots in raid groups. Nothing is stopping the seller from running off with your money and blocking you, and nothing is stopping the party from wiping and deciding to split because they don‚Äôt really want to continue.
---
Just find a guild that does e content you like and try to get a party together.
---
I mean personally, I think buying/selling content clears is both idiotic and shameful, but at the same time, LFG is almost always completely empty anyway so I don‚Äôt really see a need for policing it, most people just get one of the many guilds they‚Äôre part of to help them out.
---
Even if I couldn‚Äôt find anybody to clear content with me, I‚Äôd personally never pay somebody to include me.
---
Relax, after 7 years Anet discovered what a twitch giveaway is. Maybe in 2 years they stop banning  pepe emotes and then we can link accounts.
---
This is gonna regress into a "safe space" argument and I'm maybe about three years over that.
---
Hard pass
---
To build on this... I started to find PvP most fun when I stopped following meta builds.
---
The pip rewards are identical for bronze, silver and gold, marginally better for plat and only significantly better if you're sitting in legendary. And over a season, if you use the same build you *will* eventually reach the rank you deserve, whatever that might be. From there out your win rate is gonna be roughly 50%.
---
I've accepted that I'm not going to hit legendary, and I've accepted that if I use the same build I will inevitably reach the 50/50 point I deserve to be in.
---
So, given those things, at the start of a season I just... invent a build. It can be a shitposting build. It doesn't matter to me, as long as it's fun to play or just baffling for enemies to play against. No matter how good or bad it is, it will reach the 50/50 rank it deserves and the rewards will balance out.
---
Be the shitpost you want to see in the world.
---
1. Both are great for both, warrior is easier to get into and generally very strong, Guard is one of my fav but its more niche, its very dps, and now also kinda support with firebrand. You can do melee or range-ish on both, they both can support and dps, firebrand can heal a little but its not a healer. 
---
2. when theyre recruiting. ask the dude putting his ‚Äúadd‚Äù in chat, if theyre a good guild he‚Äôll be very helpful and answer your questions. 
---
3. Whenever youre ready to play the content, unless you want to boost a character, but I dont recommend that anyway, even if you played before. But if you do want to and its your choice,you buy an expac and get a 80 boost. 
---
4. in game meh, its more used by people trying to copy commanders but wont put the 200g into it. I can try to answer your questions, feel free to pm me here and I can answer your questions and give you my in-game name so you can send me mails when you have new ones, im not well versed in raids and fractals but ive been playing the game since launch. I can at least steer you towards the info you want.  
---
Welcome back.
---
No.
---
Since we have 3 2v2 maps I predict on the 30th they will announced 2v2 que as an upcoming feature.  It would be the most logical thing at this point.
---
I figure they only released the map as an early way of beta testing the map. Imo.
---
Gold to gems?
---
B-but turning GW2 into cookie clicker is a legitimate way to play!
---
gotta have one of these posts every week, it's just a natural force of nature at this point. can we have some form of automated response to this?
---
I see it is beyond your understanding.
---
Probably accurate. Doubt he‚Äôs got a job if he has this much time to shitpost ;-)
---
I can't think of why anet should do that.  
---
* The story over all is unfinished.
---
* Ingame economy is working.
---
* There are still player playing every day.
---
I have been doing achievements on Dragonfall the past  2-3 weeks - it's a really good map.
---
The events that push the meta, the final fight, the loot, the achievements, both passive and those you have to be more active in , it all is very enjoyable. It seems well balanced to me anyway. Hope they have more maps like it.
---
Inb4 Guild Wars 2 Mobile
---
You know.... Guild Wars 2 Moible is rumored.... It might....
---
Nah, it's all good. People are just ansty about the game and come on freddit to vent. It's why we have a million posts lately about "OMG the sky is falling" lol.
---
If it's just a plain LS5 announcement, holy shit what a waste of time.
---
If it's an announcement that LS5 will be functionally an expansion with elite specs or something, then that's pretty cool.
---
If it's an expansion announcement, that's very cool.
---
I fully expect it to be a plain LS5 announcement.
---
I actually agree with this. It doesn't translate that well as a viewable experience.
---
So you don't want the game to do better or be better?
---
Well then.... Just remember that when the game becomes a dumpster fire.
---
Nice, can't wait to see the same 10 wintraders/account sharers occupy the leaderboards.
---
Ohhh!!  Good to know.  Then if posted there, should be no issues
---
That's..........inherently untrue actually, at least as far as PVP. Anet absolutely attempted to design it to appeal to viewership of the PVP scene.
---
It was just designed like shit.
---
And becomes crafting station on demand!
---
I am a guard main and personally like gs better. Faster and more mobility gs 5 is great when you land it. Hammer is just too slow to use unless playing against inexperienced players.
---
but then you would have to count everything that heals over time ... and now you are missing a pile of other things
---
They should put the expansions on sale. That way new people can be enticed to buy them and get double xp during the event.
---
I know this is ridiculous, right. But I think the leaks might be real?
---
This is pretty much why GW2 is good... even though there's content drought, the game is fun and there is always stuff to do.
---
You could salvage them for mats you'd need to craft legendary weapons. You'd need an ascended salvage kit to do so.
---
Great thanks :] I'll be putting my time and effort towards crafting one now that im burnt out on PvP. 
---
This will be interesting...
---
They did look into at one point but couldn't agree with Sony and Microsoft over something.
---
I think one of the reasons was because they was releasing content so fast and it wasn't really feasible on a console.
---
That's obviously not an issue anymore lol.
---
This all would kill the game then
---
no, i'm saying that they give the impression that they don't have many resources (poor release schedule, bugs going unfixed for years, balance team seems to have no idea what they're doing, 3 of the main game modes seemingly abandoned) but that is not the case, they have around or over 250 employees and they are making money, management just doesn't seem to have a clue on what they are supposed to be doing.
---
Of all the MMOs I've played the GW2 power tray certainly always seemed desiged to go on consoles at some point so I wouldnt be surprised.
---
Its already been posted here
---
There is a gate in the field of ruin which opens to the crystal desert. But the NPC guarding the gate says that it is too dangerous to enter...
---
Waiting for them to open that gate.
---
I hope expansion sale will take place before this event hits. It would make sense.
---
I mean, that's what descriptives say. And if we do that we'll end up not understanding each other. There's a reason words mean things.
---
Yeah, this is kinda sad, gonna kungfu dejavu again, not to mention im from Ocx, which almost always excludes from any official or 3rd party giveaways, thanks to vpn tho.
---
My hope : Twitch Drops or all Players who login first week when Season 5 release.
---
Agreed, Anet staff seem to quite carefully refer to them as "content teams," even when the person they are talking to keeps saying "living world teams."
---
They could all be living world teams, since they haven't corrected anyone either, but Anet has not called them that since the roadmap post as far as I'm aware. It may be that one of the teams is not a living world team, or it may just be that they are all somewhat flexible and Anet doesn't want to imply that they never work on anything else. We don't know.
---
poison ivy has a proper outfit underneath the starborn, a mix of nightmare court and other racial pieces, it looked close enough to old school poison ivy, but i wanted the really skimpy look from the bad batman movies that i found on google images
---
I think I'd really enjoy a server without waypoints. On death, respawn at the last zone transition. It's the only way to make map connections really meaningful. As it currently stands, the story takes you to each map and then they all might be next to each other, far away, or stacked like pancakes for all it matters. They are just a click away. Take away that click and ideas like this become awesome.
---
This game does not run very well on AMD and a lot of people are "upgrading" to the new AMD processors.  
---
You will get the best performance on a recent gen Intel I7+ at 5Ghz+ with the fastest RAM you can get.  
---
WvW will always be a struggle, but it's actually the network bandwidth that is the bottleneck more than anything else.
---
I used to overflow in them and delete them too, but now Auric Ingots can be used as a currency to exchange once a day for a Faction Provisioner Token at the provisioner vendor in Auric Basin (at the entrance wp, Tarnished Treetop). 
---
You need 300 of these tokens to make a set of legendary PvE armor (to buy Gifts of Craftsmanship), so if you're not in a rush to make legendary armor you can collect them every day and when you'll actually go and craft that armor, you'll already have a nice pile of tokens waiting for you.
---
Here's the wiki page for more info: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Faction_Provisioner
---
If you don't have any plans to ever make legendary armor, or if you've already crafted all the legendary sets you need, then yeah either make fulgurite &amp; sell Jeweled Damask Patches every once in a while, or keep deleting them.
---
(Provisioner tokens can also be used for legendary sigils/runes but who cares about that xD)
---
Is that pickled or something? What's going on there?
---
It does not align with North/South, it aligns with Evon Gnashblade location.
---
&gt;if defender is somewhat competent and have at least 10 ppl
---
To be fair those are already 2 very big assumptions that are not met a lot of times. Even more since the T3 structure damage reduction "nerf" (the term not about whether it was a good/bad change but I didn't find a better one to put there) where T3 now open visibly faster than before.
---
Also if you also have a few somewhat competent people you too can play with shields and not care about ACs most of the time.
---
Very nice thank you mate !
---
Luckily, I believe that's now _actually_ true. At launch, you couldn't earn spirit shards from HoT unless you unlocked and completed the raid mastery tree. I believe you now earn shards so long as you've completed all _unlocked_ masteries, though!
---
Hehe that was me too for the longest time and is totally fair :') if you end up wanting to finish it you can look for someone doing the "Escort" path raid. 
---
From my limited understanding it's by far the easiest raid path to bring and carry new people in. Untraditional in that it's mostly and Escort mission instead of a real boss and a lot more forgiving as long as a few people know what they're doing.

I....don't....work for anet and I never have?

It would be funny if the exciting announcement was just a new mount or something.  Here are my predictions:
---
Bearclaw 
---
Seascale
---
Thunder Megazord
---
Even though I never played GW1, I can understand, if gw1 vets would like to re-visit some areas in gw2 but at this point, I wonder if focussing on old areas is a boon or a burden. Sure, you might reel in some more gw1 vets with the nostalgia but on the other hand, most devs that were responsible to create those regions in gw1 arent around anymore and I am not sure anymore, if it might be better, if they go somewhere new where they can create the lore and design themselves rather than being narrowed down by gw1 content and its writing.
---
last time i checked, we were sailing towards elona and didnt use waypoints to get there.
---
Played over 4k games, didn't know about that kiting spot at 11:46 on capricorn. I guess this is why it is so good to watch streamers and people better at pvp than you, you can pick things up just by watching.
---
I finished Factions on 30 different characters. Same with Eye of the North. Not sure why you didn't finish it, it's a fast enough campaign, and the Jade Sea, the last area you visit, is probably my favorite area in all of Guild Wars 1.
---
In a game that many people play for cosmetic rewards, there's not really such a thing as just a cosmetic. Top tier stats are easy to get and it's not what most people play for here. Most people play for cosmetic rewards....much like Guild Wars 1.
---
Dont come with this crap that GW2 is just not interesting, FFXIV has the WORST COMBAT SYSTEM and NO PVP, boring as fuck and still pull 5k viwers on twitch, ppl need stop defending this fucking dying game.
---
Is the Mac version still OpenGL based? Wasn't it deprecated for Apple products some time ago? Then I stand corrected. A bit.
---
Not really, I keep a bit track of what is happening in gw2 in the [calendar](https://gw2cal.fribbtastic.net/) and the last seasons always had around two weeks between them.
---
Since season 14 we had a 2-week break, Season 12-14 had 3. 11-12 had 2. 10-11 had a 3. 9-10 had 2 again.

Dont you guys have phones ?
---
I guess there is a good reason why direct excess to Elona (or other HoT/LS maps) isnt granted from core maps: They are not suited for under lvl 80 players.
---
Just image a level 60-70 player strolling from MM all the way across a deserted LC map just to discover that the exit on the other side requires PoF and lvl 80.
---
Also wouldnt make sense to have players enter Elona in DH instead of CO when going there for the first time...
---
was already posted and removed, so dont bother
---
The announcement better be a engine improvement, i know a bunch of people who won't touch gw2 because it has the frame rate of a browser game and that is sadly true.
---
Underwater sucks and isn't balanced, I don't think ANET will ever put effort and resources into bringing underwater content up to date.
---
Not while it's on a heavily modified GW1 engine we wont. lol
---
Yes yes yes yes
---
I 100% disagree with boosting your first character, but I don't really want to get into a discussion about your post as a whole - just wanting to note that early story missions with level 80 gear are hilariously easy until you get to the level 70 story or so. Your level gets downscaled, but you still keep the big stat boosts on your lvl80 gear, weapons and trinkets. Remember that low level stuff only has one small attribute bonus instead of 3 large ones.
---
Let's be fair here though... you get experience gated by levels in the early game as well. I agree that some things were a bit too much, especially since the original personal story is available in coherent chunks through leveling process so you don't have to level through other means midway, but the concept is the same
---
If you're going to focus on f2p content - I think dungeons deserve some love. You can also do 1-20 fractal training, which f2p players will appreciate. Command festival events for larger groups.  
---
All of those with world bosses and guild missions should keep you busy enough.
---
No chance
---
I would pay for this.
---
If you‚Äôve completed them on one character there is nothing stopping you from buying the teleport items.
---
It would work if you were not supposed to unlock everything but rather master some things and others will be made unavailable for you. Which would make some sense and would be a nice thing to make people different.
---
Though they would have to make it character bound in this case.
---
They have the ability to restrict map portal use based on level, that is no excuse at all. 
---
They also have the ability to restrict access till a certain story step has been completed on at least one character.
---
Teleport items?
---
Roleplayers would extensively use an empty map for their own purpose.
---
Making it a RP hub 11 months a year wouldn't be a bad thing.
---
I think the four teams were
---
outfits
---
mount skins
---
other gemstore items

[https://i.imgur.com/PsA37f0.png](https://i.imgur.com/PsA37f0.png) I tried to calculate it a while back and it was better to do the 10 recipe, unless you get very lucky with the 1 and then it is slightly cheaper.
---
Why is HoT more expensive than PoF at online retailers ? i mean PoF is more recent , shouldn't it be the other way around ? Also i see DLGamer has like zero stock of HoT anyway , so currently the only way to buy HoT is directly from the Guild wars store . Is there like a shortage of HoT keys ?
---
I just read the title and instantly thought of Hildy. Good god his questchain alone is worth the sub fo FFXIV. Amazing stuff :D

\*Puts a character right in front of instance to escort Demmi Beetlestone out of old LA with Tybalt Leftpaw and cries himself to sleep\*
---
what the hell are you going on about
---
F2p can't access silverwaste. It won't allow f2p players in without owning the episode. To own the episode you have to buy gems or gold to gems. Which you can't do because you can't use the gemstore nor exchange gold to gems unless you have a full account. Don't believe me? Nothing is stoping you from creating a f2p acc and test it out...
---
In wvw, If you are playing a healer support such as firebrand, when you heal your team mates and boon share with them you don't get the drops from the kills. I think you should fix that.
---
that's the point XD
---
It has riot in the name for a reason ;)
---
can't really help you decide what you prefer but just wanted to bring up some things:
---
greatsword is more widely used in builds, while hammer is quite limited especially in pvp
---
exordium costs like 8x more than mjolnir, like not even close
---
for core guard pvp, greatsword was a staple since forever while hammer came and fell out of the meta
---
i'd advise against getting too attached to a build cuz the meta changes and whatnot..make the legendary cuz you like the skin
---
They are probably trying to empty as much gem from people as possible with such filler discounts before going for character slots, keys, bank slots etc like every year. It simply makes the sale a boring wait though so eh
---
I am a new player and working on my living world 2 at the moment. Is it better to wait with this so I can do it during this time or?
---
I love actual mechanics in Fractals, and the raidlike fights in them. More mechanics is better, as long as the fight is actually designed for it. I hate the RNG mechanics and the new dungeon-like fractals. If they'd do more Fractals like 99CM/100CM and drop instabilities I'd instantly come back to them. It sucks that we're stuck with shit Fractals like SR, TO and shit instabilities.
---
Underwater combat sucks
---
&gt; That only truly applies to PvE 
---
aka 95% of the game atm
---
&gt; and considering support builds can't run either viper's or berserker's most of the time I'd say you shot completely off mark.
---
fair enough. a handful of classes have one (if lucky)  support specs, that only see play in the highest of endgame PvE (fractals/raid)
---
so I guess its not 99,99998% of the players running zerker/vipers, just 98,999998%.
---
&gt; Btw, maybe this is news for you but every single game has the same issue where there's always a top pick. 
---
every single game has a "meta"? sure  
---
every single game has a "meta" reduced to just 2 options? I dont think we play the same games  
---
&gt; Are you planning on fixing that innovately?
---
no, and thats not my job. 
---
relevant: https://youtu.be/QHHg99hwQGY?t=3411 (p.s: the entire panel is awesome and worth watching)
---
Wow I found it at LA. But why event merchant in Labyrinthine Cliff not selling it ;(
---
You can already get to a level 80 map (Frostgorge Sound) from a level 1-15 map (Wayfarer foothills). That's just a lazy excuse.
---
If you mean "life steal" = deal extra DPS and gain this amount as HP, we have quiet some sources doing this in the game. But they are very weak, because otherwise they would be OP.
---
If you mean life steal = a % of your DPS is turned into HP, we have quiet some heal skills doing exactly that as well. (warrior berserker heal, guardian meditation heal) We even have a class with this abillity in a grand master trait (thief "Invigorating precision" = you heal for 10% of your crit DPS / if you have fury you heal for 20% of crit DPS).
---
This trait is very powerfull in open world PvE, because of the stupid amount of healing it provides. BUT this trait actually competes with other traits which will grant a lot more DPS. And if you have a heal support in the team, you want that DPS instead of the sustain.
---
Other MMOs have other forms of (IMO also horrible) progression next to leveling like itemlevel, attunement, questlocked content, etc. Mastery is fine, but should really be some actual progression instead of something that's done before you even know a new track exists.
---
This error doesn't stop execution, it's just a screen before i end process.  
---
No, there is nothing else in the stack for all these *d3d9.dlll!* threads when i use the dll function (means that i activated UI wit keys in game and let it collect informations like dps, corrupt, cleanses etc ... )  
---
But when i don't use the UI(means that i don't displayed the gui by press keys, so i don't start to collect), one stack thing change like you can see on new image. In this case, there is no problem with used RAM .
---
thanks for the explanation
---
LS S1 was a thing, so :\^)
---
I've never had trouble getting any mastery points nor exp. The game gives you mastery points for absolutely everything, and their exp requirements are so insanely low.
---
Normally it should be locked for anyone except you for 24h, so depending on the name you chose this could be "risky"
---
Technically there is a Tunnel between Desert Highlands and the Ebonhawk quarry! They just never opened it. 
---
Even the exit in DH exists!
---
You can't just randomly mention leaks like that without a link or something....
---
you got so many stupid replies..jeez
---
so leveling normally to learn the game is such a meme! especially in your case..you seem set on playing druid and it's not "ranger with a few additional skills" as someone else said
---
druid is an entirely different playstyle and even those that insist on leveling normally will admit that the story is so unchallenging you can complete it by doing literally whatever you want
---
and no, there isn't any amazing intricacy or skill in playing druid, it's extremely simplistic..and even if it was, you'd never learn any of it from personal story or killing moas in queensdale lol
---
you'll still have to unlock it and that usually goes faster with a dps build..those "hundreds of points" some other clever redditor mentioned only take like 2-3h to get
---
another thing, druid is only played seriously in raids and you might have a hard time with it outside of that..bad players also use them in fractals i guess
---
ranger animations aren't bad, you just have bad taste in animations :)
---
What grave?
---
They would if their new model is ditching "expansions" and future seasons will be locked behind a "Season pass" (basically expansion, just delivered in a LS episodic format with new elite specs and other expansion-level stuff thrown in)
---
This ^ really.
---
There is really no reason to ever use hammer on guardian for any game mode, there are always better options aside from a couple extremely niche team builds that aren't that great.
---
Remember how they delayed raid 4 to train "2nd raid team"? 
---
I still remember.
---
It could become a new city a hybrid of tyria and Crystal desert/ elona
---
F2Ps have access to silverwastes
---
Just keep doing your best, it's all you can ever really do. As somebody who impulsively spends if a bad depressive episode catches me before I can calm it down, and as somebody with a spending addiction I didn't even know about until gaming got *this* predatory, I understand where you're coming from. I only dabble in GW2 these days, and most of my time goes to games with no microtransactions at all, or with microtransactions that require extra steps to be able to purchase anything (see: FFXIV.)
---
He's basically Logan's wife by now tbh
---
&gt; Lesson: basically just clean your facking dust on your laptop.
---
Yup. A vacuum cleaner on a gentle-ish setting held up to wherever the fan is for 30 seconds or so should be part of general computer maintenance. 
---
When you clean the room, give the computer a quick clean too via the fan vent.
---
Need screenshot mate, some of us arent in-game right now, and personally I can‚Äôt recall the compass you are talking about.
---
Today is the last day.
---
That would require a complete engine re-write which would be about 2 years of work by a decently sized dev team. 
---
Unfortunately, GW2 isn't big enough to allow for that.
---
It's a cub eat cub world out there
---
it is not weird at all. The map needs to be added, tested out by people, collected feedback, fine tuned, then it can be added as serious gamemode. Djinn dominion took 9 months to make it from beta to queue. 
---
We havd 2vs2 tournament back then, and now we have third map. If map gets tested and works well, *then* it is time to include queue for it. Not the other way around.
---
u/BackIsBachus has some really solid advice. Mesmers used to be more challenging to play but also semi-godlike. Now, they're reined in a bit in difficulty but can no longer carry an entire team on their back due to being so overpowered. 
---
Some other bits:
---
* With sword/sword, mesmers are surprisingly hardy in melee combat. 4 is a block and 2 is an evade, which means you can take a beating without *actually* taking a beating, but this takes a bit of practice as it's down to timing. Mesmers are one of the most seen tanks in the game because they're very hard to hit if played correctly. 
---
* Sceptre is perhaps not a great weapon for open world stuff as it does condition damage which tends to be best off in late-game scenarios. Staff is similar, but provides a good level of mobility and defensive options so is much more viable and pairs well with greatsword if you like range. 
---
* Phantasmal Defender has one of the very few taunt skills in the game, so can be used to get enemies off you. 
---
* Clones can tank for you on some bosses that use projectiles (like Old Tom when you get to fractals - you can just let your clones pile up and use them as a shield when he starts shooting out stuff).
---
* Blink and portal are skills you either love and use all the time or think are a complete waste of a slot. Personally, I don't use them in combat outside of PvP.
---
* At 80, both elite specs are basically mesmer turned up to eleven in different ways. Mirages are teleport-spamming monsters that use illusions to set up ambushes and chronomancers can either be very decent group support or phantasm-spewing instant armies.
---
Have you played on the EU server lol?
---
I have literally hundreds of tickets on me just from doing Watchknight Wrecker and random Festival events. They're not hard to get at all and I didn't realize I amassed 250+ of them over a week of very very casual play
---
No you're absolutely right. It's easier to just go out and do something else to make money.  Not sure why anyone would sell or even pay to enter someone's home instance.
---
What's the point of this response?  You can literally say that about anything and it still doesn't answer the question.  The point is, why would someone do it if they can make more money doing something else and why would anyone pay money when home instances are advertised free everywhere?
---
I don't think that 4th one is fully staffed.
---
This one: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cbua27/reply_to_recent_leak_post_living_story_season_five/
---
I don't know why but I feel like there's some truth to it
---
Here it is: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cbua27/reply_to_recent_leak_post_living_story_season_five/
---
It looks like one of those fake leaks, but since the old papaya one was right about PoF...
---
Yes, this is effective.  I would always get happy when I came across ambient/neutral creatures with yellow text because they give big **BONUS XP BABY** because everyone ignores them and they have been alive since the map spawned.   With stacked buffs, you see huge chunks of XP being added to you bar with every kill.
---
&gt; her actions with Lazarus wasn't detective stuff.
---
You're being pedantic both with this and the Durmond Priory stuff that it's ridiculous.  What detective code of conduct does the character have to follow for you to consider it detective work? lol  Whether or not it's actual detective work is irrelevant anyway.  We're talking about if she's doing stuff other than talking about her relationship with kasmeer and she has.
---
The animations are really nice.
---
The scene switch at 0:08 is too long.
---
The letters at the beginning are awful, they disrupt the flow and don't fit the background at all.
---
https://i.imgur.com/UEaiLEb.png only logical thing to do.
---
I could, but I don't think that's what OP looked for. 
---
I limited my list to healing utilities, since OP talked about them. (Plus the bufffoods and the wiki page about lifesteal,)
---
It should be moderated on every sub-reddit. The downvote button was never a "dislike" or "disagree" button and many sub-reddits went out of their way to point this out but not enforce it. Unless you think certain comments getting visibility literally depending on the time of day is a good system.
---
There's no requirement for grouping so no it doesn't make it more "groupy" than home instances, jumping puzzles or whatever else you can do in this game with other people.
---
Well, I guess we'll have to agree to disagree. If Anet themselves said Orr was endgame, then I don't see how Dragonstand isn't end game. You're entitled to your definition but it's a big mistake to think that's the de facto definition, particularly if you can't look it up somewhere, like a dictionary and you really can't. The classic definition of end game doesn't work for either my end game or yours.
---
At any rate, we're not going to go any further here, we simply disagree, which is fine.
---
&gt; The problem with her character is that her main focal point, being a lesbian, adds nothing to her or her character development.
---
But it's not her focal point.
---
Wow, indeed a lot of option. I also like the fact the opt-out of the 'common' RPG stats (strength, dex, etc)
---
Yeah, unless you're selling access to your instance at an insanely high price, you can get better RoI from just running around and playing the game normally (like just killing random things and doing random events, not even farming).
---
True. You get more than you realize. The difference is that if you want to do normal gauntlet you have tickets for years and probably never run out, but if you want something harder a stack is around 30 tries. Which for the challenge is not a lot.
---
The difference between never running out and grinding for a few tries is imo too big.
---
Ok thanks. Couldn't find info for it anywhere, not on their website and twitter.
---
In short: No. 
---
In long: No, that is not possible; macros in GW2 are extremely limited.
---
Get four friends and open up the PoF Guildhall then, it's a pretty chill place without all the decorations and NPCs!
---
Very nice! It's so rare that I see other male sylvari mains.
---
Personal story was utter trash, however the production of all latter stories is far better
---
In future, a lot of event information ends up on the wiki and you can usually find start and end dates there.
---
I brought my condi zerker warrior up to plat despite all the hate I got.
---
At least they can't complain when they're dead
---
Perhaps I burned out on the three tries -&gt; grind/boss blitz -&gt; three tries. It's too time consuming imo.
---
What is the best place in your opinion to kill the mobs? The bandits?
---
Purchase all recipes for auric weapons, from vendor in tarir, craft all of them, and unlock luminates backplate ascended backpack, u will have 0 auric dust after that üòÇ trust me
---
In long, it is possible to just make a fast autohotkey script to do all of it. I believe that's not legal according to the ToS though.
---
Perhaps this is stupid but could it be that you don't have the bouncing mushrooms mastery yet?
---
She died, too.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Dont you have phones?!
---
No. I was talking about how "she's a lesbian" gets more attention from the writers than "she's a detective".
---
*You* arbitrarily declared that I was saying she doesn't do anything but declare lesbianism.
---
There is a world of difference.
---
But you can go into a home instance with a group to gathering, so why wouldn't offering to take people in not be acceptable?
---
[Double exp event coming up](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/catch-up-with-the-expansion-boost-special-event/)
---
yeah but when most of takeovers got to the point of
---
- Enemy wasn't there
---
- Golem rush at 2 am
---
- Enemy pulled the forces to defend from other server on other border
---
- Enemy had only baboons without commander
---
- Enemy gave up after contesting ring with Warclaws for 45 min
---
It goes down quickly to "lets go knock on t3 stuff to lure enemy zerg into field to have some fun time" since winning/losing matchup do not get you anything aside other servers to play against.
---
If there was actual **rewards  for winning** that would be the whole other gamemode.
---
I feel like the pics being under 18 actually makes it way worse
---
People absolutely hate how underwater combat feels, even after the insane rework that was given to us last year. It's a pity, but I think underwater content is restricted to trashmobs and pretty scenery. 
---
However, it might be that we will be standing on ice floes and shooting at a monster in the water.
---
The real reason they got grounded is the bad grammar.
---
You can make human like Autohotkey delays. Unless Anet specifically re-implement spymalware into the game again you are safe to use it. Last time they done it they had huge backlash and in result lifted suspension from everyone who asked for it (even since most of them were actually hackers)
---
As for me actually I use all of post processing on GW hook for PvE and disable it in WvW with one press of the button to gain performance increase.
---
To clarify though, this is for the XP portion of masteries - not the actual mastery points, right? That's where I hit my biggest hurdle. 
---
I might still give this a go. Any thoughts on the most effective way to spend those two weeks? Just public events?
---
I actually forgot she was a detective...
---
&gt;If there was actual rewards for winning that would be the whole other gamemode.
---
Completely agree but unfortunately still heavily incompatible with being able to jump server whenever and would have very different behavior/impact on people in NA and EU. In the current state the game is not really fun for anybody. And with fewer and fewer people it is becoming very hard. The current server I'm linked to is doing the yo-yo between EU T4 and EU T5 and well... at least we never have queues? (or like 10 on reset on EB for 1h30 but that's about it).
---
One thing that makes fights frustrating is that many commanders don't even want to take the fights they know they don't have a very good chance of winning (especially true for open tags because if you lose fights you lose people and if you lose people you're gaonna have an even harder time). Basically people are playing as if winning still meant something and that "not giving the enemy kill points" was still something that mattered unfortunately.
---
&gt;Enemy gave up after contesting ring with Warclaws for 45 min
---
Fortunately not possible anymore because holy hell that was a bad idea...
---
As for the actual reasons T3 are taken I know I may be repeating myself but most of the time attackers make no effort to not be "punished" by some knowledgeable defenders (whether such an impact should exist or not is not the point here, just it exists). If I see something put down that I can easily take care of I will go do that, the point is that I should not have been to or have only been able to marginally slow down the attack.
---
So a little update.  I've taken the gearing advice and got Rabid as a replacement until I am able to obtain Viper's.  However, after growing extremely frustrated last night as I worked through LS4.  I decided to break from Rev. and decided to run and level from scratch a Necro. 
---
I've never played Necro in GW1 or GW2, so I figured it was a chance to learn something new and to learn from scratch again.  I'll play the game in order.  I appreciate all the feedback I received on this subject but after two nights in a row continually dying to random mobs on missions it has become clear that something is clearly wrong with how I play this game and so Ill start over and go from there.
---
Thanks!
---
"Introducting.... GW2 Mobile, its like GW2 but on your phone!"
---
Same, I wish you could just buy small amount makes it so much easier.

/facepalm
---
I lol'ed so hard. thx!
---
utter trash? Well I did not find it UTTER trash, maybe a bit boring at times. However if it gets better like you said, im even looking forward more to it!
---
I didn't follow the game lately so it avoided my attention. Thanks :)
---
It would stop reasonable adults from it, and they are minority for that "platform". People that need protection the most (kids and their parents, people with gambling addictions) get a dick.
---
i dont recall cantha having bamboo roads, they had grey brick
---
Can we stop making posts regarding fucking teapot and his cronies? They are like a plague and have been ruining the mood in this subreddit lately.
---
Technically HP trains would fall under this as well...  mega oof
---
Porn is in the eye of the beholder
---
Biggest bang comes always at the end.
---
Yeah, and the results were seeing is 5 months of no new content with nothing but more talk on the horizon, which puts the whole "two-to-three-month window" and "relatively steady release of new content" into perspective.
---
&gt; (but he's on holiday)
---
You forget part about "passionate side project of unpaid intern"
---
^ THIS.
---
Am i the only one who find those yellow messages wierd ?
---
No, you're wrong. A couple means two, that's literally the definition of the word. You ask for a couple of pencils, you're asking for 2 pencils. If you want a handful, you ask for a handful, or a few.
---
Just because *you've* become accustomed to misusing a word doesn't change it's definition for others.
---
Its great that they're announcing an announcement, except they'd better have something to actually announce.
---
After a 4 month content drought (And presumably even more, considering that this is an announcement, not a release) + completely silence, they'd better have something big in the works.
---
They said that season 5 would include expansion level content, and after spending so much time in silence, I hope they actually deliver on said "expansion level content." 
---
New elite specs, new mechanics (A lot of people are thinking dual classes), templates, maybe the tengu race that's just sitting their with their city in a starting area waiting to be used. ect.
---
If this announcement is just "Season 5 episode 1: New currency, New map, New mount. Tata lovelies, see you in 4 months." I think I'm gonna be done with the game.
---
1. Both are great for both, warrior is easier to get into and generally very strong, Guard is one of my fav but its more niche, its very dps, and now also kinda support with firebrand. You can do melee or range-ish on both, they both can support and dps, firebrand can heal a little but its not a healer.
---
2. when theyre recruiting. ask the dude putting his ‚Äúadd‚Äù in chat, if theyre a good guild he‚Äôll be very helpful and answer your questions.
---
3. Whenever youre ready to play the content, unless you want to boost a character, but I dont recommend that anyway, even if you played before. But if you do want to and its your choice,you buy an expac and get a 80 boost. You could wait for a sale if you want too. 
---
4. in game meh, its more used by people trying to copy commanders but wont put the 200g into it. I can try to answer your questions, feel free to pm me here and I can answer your questions and give you my in-game name so you can send me mails when you have new ones, im not well versed in raids and fractals but ive been playing the game since launch. I can at least steer you towards the info you want.
---
what homework lol?
---
I'm not really good with these things, so I've just installed d912pxy and now I can't use radial mount menu. I've tried installing a new version of radial menu and it's still the same. Can anyone help me?
---
Like try to compare community managers of Anet and DE... I think you would see visual difference there...
---
Yes
---
They're from the device that let's you teleport to world bosses that you can buy in the cash shop. It notifies you when they're up, instead of having to go to an external timer site, or use an overlay.
---
What about the asian People?
---
ofc its ci lei, who else could it have been.
---
Don't you have to attune yourself to waypoint before being able to go back to them?
---
It's why they release that bit of energy whenever someone approaches them for the first time.
---
&gt; Having classes lose some of their core identity in order for ANet to flog a bunch of new options on the gemstore sounds awful.
---
What do you mean? The gemstore options are just cosmetic, nothing lost is being put on the gemstore.
---
Their sentence was actually grammatically correct. Yours, however....
---
Tbh. Tpot is fine, but snake is a prick lol
---
Gr8, bunch of kids/teens in this reddit.
---
I cant believe its on the top of gw2 Reddit... you weirdos
---
oh shit - I never knew that was a thing. Why in the HECK did they take them out of the game?!
---
hahaha name + comment = perfect
---
What I did is put on a bunch of buffs  
---
food, utilities, exp boosters (with a killstreak booster) an enrichment infusion for exp, both kinds of fireworks (lucky draketails and exploding draketails give two different, stacking buffs) and the guild hall exp buff   
---
then went off to Lake Doric to kill a tremendous amount of centaurs. the exp gains are downright respectable!
---

I wouldnt mind taking over the world in the name of mordre- MOTHER TREE

You don't need to buy expansions to enjoy the game, but you would need to buy the expansions to experience everything in the game. A lot depends on what type of content you're after.
---
For example, if you're interested mostly in raids, that's all expansion content.
---
If you're more interested in open world content and dynamic events, you can absolutely enjoy the game.
---
In fact, the free to play game, with certain limitations, is the same game many of us spent $60 on when it first came out. And many of us enjoyed the hell out of it.
---
So yes, you can enjoy the game without spending money but if your'e gong to continue with the game after max level, you're going to have to spend money at some point.
---
Hizen bosssss
---
&gt;but still it is perfect delivery system to contest ring indefinitely.
---
Ah yes, totally agree on this it's one of the many issues I have with the mount.
---
&gt;Problem is that atm somewhat defended T3 becomes huge slog fest for an hour+ even if you have competent siege commander with overwhelming force.
---
Taking this from experience I really have a lot of issues understanding this point of view (assuming somewhat means you have a bit of siege and few people who can use an AC a a treb without turning it). If you can have a basic Supply control and a few roamers/havoc putting pressure on the rest of the map your T3 (or another T3 because it just happened like that) will just fall pretty quickly. I have seen so many Keeps have their supply halved just because a zerg was passing by  destroying the siege they could get that it is extremely easy to empty the supply, once it's empty the pressure by the havoc will pay off and you will have more than a single T3 vulnerable.
---
Then again the commander is often not the only one who's at fault and many times other players around are not helping much.
---
In any case my view of WvW may not be the same as everyone else since doing a havoc in a 1-5 people group and getting a zerg (on something at least 3-4 times bigger than you) to come remove you by force from a structure is called a win in my book (bonus point if it's after a EWP of Invul fortifications and/or I get an orange cross) :p
---
Fucking loved the Kourna release, launched 1 day after my vacation started and i could farm for sprockets 3 whole weeks

This is fucking hilarious

name checks out i wonder if he has a larger collection then me
---
I have bought all the living stories and expansions and I will deffo play them in order (i like to support good games, would not feel good to play it for free). My OCD cannot handle it otherwise. I only did the intro in PoF for the mount but basicly with my eyes closed haha.  
---
The "recap" of living world 1 did not make any sense to me tho, just a few random names thrown at me expecting it to stick for some reason haha.   
---
There is a XP increase event comming for living world and exp tho, should I wait for that?
---
And same in polish. Which is a bit weird since it's from different language group...
---
Does anyone think we might not ever get new elite specializations? I highly doubt we would get them for LS5 and I am also not convinced GW2 will have a third expansion. Anyone have any dev quotes or similar stuff that confirms there will be new specializations at some point?
---
I have zero regrets over buying them, heart of thorns maps are masterpieces and the mounts are by far the best thing in the game, but I also played in vanilla and had fun as well, though keeping up with people who have mounts probably isn't very fun if you have to run
---
I hate to break it to you but it was teapot who organized the bout since he stands to profit handsomely from the views. 
---
It has been like that since teapot found out that turning his stream into a soap opera where him and his cronies mob the casuals, netted him way more viewers than streaming gw2.
---
I mean people certainly don't play this game for the content.
---
Objectively-speaking, the GW2 cast are well written in my opinion. The problem is they have far outstayed their welcome. Also, the story is not married to gameplay, so it's not as immersive. As a result, they feel more like dead weight who just follow you around and do commentary, rather than members of your team. 
---
This a big problem because the Story Instances are designed like cutscenes rather than complex challenges to overcome with your allies. The story is not married to gameplay in GW2.
---
It‚Äôs either this or a pencil drawn charr or some new player saying he‚Äôs overwhelmed. Not much goes on here.
---
I hate to break it to you but it was teapot who organized the bout since he stands to profit handsomely from the views.
---
afair you can replay the LS instances.. without the rewards but you can redo the fights
---
Yah totally luck dependant ... 50/50
---
Create a new character and off you go...

You are right that gambits are unrewarding. There's really no point to using them except to get the achievements. Playing all of the first 3 rounds daily is a decent way to get tokens, but using gambits while doing so is not. It would be extremely nice if ANet put the rewards that were originally tied to this content back in place ([https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gauntlet\_Chance](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gauntlet_Chance)).
---
I have to assume it's because even with gambits you can blow up the bosses pretty quickly. It would probably be too good of a farm.
---
But imagine if there was a solo side to fractals where you can replay these fights solo only once per day for loot.
---
Let me give a direct comparison to my experience in Elder Scrolls Online (developed by Bethesda) vs Gw2. Bethesda gave EVERYONE watching their special announcement stream a premium mount and 5 loot boxes (and they continue to give players goodies for watching their stream). What does Anet give? O just a measly chance at getting something. I'm sorry but this is just pathetic and not worth my time.
---
I hate to break it to you, but anyone who wants to earn serious money on twitch is not playing gw2. Using twitch profit argument for a game that is non existent on social media is pretty silly. Do some research before making fool of yourself next time.

What?
---
I can already experience the story instances again with my main character, that's not what I'm asking.
---
I'm talking about having a way to repeat this content to gain gold and rewards, like every other MMO does, repeatable end game PVE content if you wish.
---
Eww xD
---
I'm talking about having a way to experience repeatable pve group content for fun and rewards.
---
Last GW2 Teatime.. not the last one period.
---
NCSoft (Tencent) is literally the reason why cantha was off-limits during the development of GW2, and has been for so long......
---
Exactly, it'll just be LS5 with some bells on. Whatever features would have been part of another expac will just be rolled into the upcoming season instead.
---
My guess is they'll try to hype it to lessen the blow of a change to their monetary model. I'm guessing a season pass for 'expansion quality living world'.
---
I'm hoping that we get an underwater expansion, for like Bubbles or something, that'll for ANet to have to make Underwater combat better.
---
Easiest way into pug raids these days. Buddy up as Firebrigade
---
He's making hundreds if not thousands off of this but you'll never admit it cause you're prolly one of his cronies, which wouldn't surprise me since teapot has managed to turn this subreddit into his own echo chamber.
---
Looking to trade some Globs of Ectoplasm for globs of something else? }]:3
---
lmao, all you have to do is target the player you want to target the emote at. makes sense right? you dont have to type the name, in fact im suprised that something so extra even worked still, good for you for finding out a new way to do it.
---
You are not only delusional, you are arrogant and stupid. Talking about someone elses money is never a trait of intelligent person. Especially when you are talking out of your ass without actuall knowledge of his financials.
---
Simple questions:
---
Do you want to use a glider? (HoT)
---
Do you want and like mounts? (PoF)
---
Just decide for yourself.
---
You don't need them, no, but at least I think  mounts make the game a lot funnier and easier. Glider - idk, I almost never us or need it, cause I got griffon and skyscale. 
---
Also HoT and PoF give you some extra elite specialization. Wanna play reaper (necro with great sword)? Then you need HoT for example. 
---
But yeah, it's still nothing you need so look for that what you want or would like to have.
---
Was going to say AO. What an amazing game. Had a sub for over ten years, and didn't actually totally finish a character. I got stuck making 60, and 150 twinks for years.
---
I don't think a game like AO will come around again. I current gamers  think people prefer something a lot simpler and easier.
---
Nobody said that though. he said he makes more money with drama on *his stream*
---
imagine being a ranger main, wanting to play wvw and getting constantly told since 7 years that you do not have any build which fits into the zerg style 99% of all players in wvw play, whatever the newest meta is.  
---
7 years of balance patches couldn't make neither thief or ranger a somewhat relevant class for zergplay in wvw.  
---
feelsanetman.
---
And thats what he cant know. Its an assumption based on hate.
---
I don't understand why Brazil is on Teatime considering it seems he didn't play the game for months
---
Yeah i will quit, because i agree wvw and pvp need dire attention and have been treated like they are on life support. But these people are forgetting that gw2 literally almost died already last year in 2018, back when they literally didnt know if living world season 4 would be a thing. And these people act like Anet was somehow supposed to suddenly put all their remaining effort into the game modes that wouldnt have convinced NCSoft to keep the game alive? Like come back to real life please.
---
Finally some new content ‚ò†Ô∏è
---
Translation: I'm such a narcissist that I can only see others as narcissists too. Also please stop bullying my friends owo
---
These are issues that have persisted since launch. This isn't a recent thing.
---
Stop e-stalking me.
---
told myself.. now im at 38,5 lol

It's better to walk around in circles clearing everything between Blitzs. That way you wait less time between respawns.

GW2 Parody: A Crappy Guide to "Should I... ?"
---
https://youtu.be/XK3l6IlSMEc
---
This will address your question.
---
It's likely to reduce how much a single person can hog a boss cage before they implemented the queue.
---
Since they have so many, why not make it a guild feature. An arena style thing. Your guild builds an arena, and as it gets upgrades, you get to pick more bosses. Then you can invite guild members or go alone fighting the bosses you unlocked and get rewards from them, up to a x limit of them a day.
---
&gt; What are you even trying to say here?
---
You're upset with the guy that he is unhappy with the game direction "without proof" but then you go on to set an arbitrary 6 month number when you will personally accept it for yourself. My point is that in 6 months you will be happy to make for yourself the same conclusion he has made for himself today, and you don't see the hypocrisy there because you're holding him to a standard you don't hold yourself to.
---
Yeah it sucks, but like, gw2 literally almost died last year because it could barely support itself. A business is not going to go to the source that literally gives them life to try to convince them that the consistently worst performing metrics of all seven years are the reasons to keep the game going. Its just childish to think that a logically run business would ever try to do that. Yes, wvw and pvp are shit by Anets own doing, nobody is arguing that, i hope they get drastic, insane updates. One of the things that really made me feel the size and scope of GW2 IS wvw, the first time i walked into it literally blew my mind as a teenager. We dont have a crystal ball to tell us wvw and pvp have always been the better performing part of the game and that anet has been lying to us this whole time. WvW and PvP were one of the three main things on the damn physical box when gw2 first launched, they obviously intend to keep both alive whenever they can do so without damaging the longevity of the game, and remember, the game almost died DESPITE Anet putting focus on the parts that their metrics say are the best performing. So I'm going to wait and see before I tune into another "content creator" spending hours and hours doom-saying
---
&gt;Last releases have added Blade and Soul support, yes.
---
OOF gotta check this out
---
What. At no point in the video do I do this lol - I actively discourage the idea that GW2 is dead.
---
Better not be any dirty luxons in that guild hall.
---
I've wondered this too. There are some really well designed fights in living story content, with a lot of work and resources put into creating them. The average player will do them probably once or twice. 
---
I dont understand why after a certain amount of time has passed to lower the chances of spoilers these fights don't get turned into fractals the same way some season 1 events have.
---
You could argue that it's a lot of work to tweak those fights to tune them for 5 man content, but its gotta be easier than creating a new fractal from the ground up doesn't it?
---
In hypothetical situation (that eventually happens more often at leas with top tier servers) you have two teams that reserve to using trebs over catapults/rams since going to AC range would be suicide/perma disable of siege and other good stuff. In that situation you just have infinite duel of bubble rotations for defense and offence with ability to try draining supps. That can consume several hours at its finest. Since most of the 50+ people in zerg are not involved they just give up and log out from the game.
---
That stuff can work in other PvP games, but they eventually have reward for winning, while GW2 do not. That is why it boils down to such a desire of simple "dethmatch" experience, where actual combat is content.
---
as i said.. you can restart them and di them with a Group for fun..
---
Can always farm magic is LS3 maps, esp Bloodstone. 1250xp a pop can add up quick.
---
&gt; Very cringe and strange 
---
just like this topic
---
That's why they originally said 1 raid wing every 3 months, and with dungeons being mostly abandoned a bit after launch, it would be really great to have some actual endgame content (there's fractal CMs, but they're literally never going to make more). They stuck with it for a bit, but now we're at 9+ months per wing.
---
Of course people are burned out and bored, especially when the players get more skilled, but the raids become more forgiving. 
---
There's lots of player always trying it for the first time, but then they too will get burned out and bored with the slow updates. For example, I came back after a huge hiatus. I'm already "done" with most of the wings I missed (only 2 new ones since I left a long time ago...) and I'm treating the raids pretty casually. 
---
A more hardcore player, even if they're new, will get bored quickly too. After that, they do the CMs once if they want, because the rewards aren't even repeatable and then there's nothing until at least 9 months later, nearly a year. It's too slow to maintain players. 
---
And of course, this also loses you veteran players which is what's happening now. 
---
It's probably because raids aren't played by enough people to really support them, but then they also don't do anything to make it easier to get into raids like an easy mode or anything.
---
Every person is responsible for their own behavior. Stop labeling people.
---
It is not hate. Just discussion
---
Non-tent?
---
What do you mean by that?
---
This is the last teatime in the form we have known it. This means teapot invited the original cast to close the show. How is it hard to understand?
---
do you really not understand how many things across the globe have changed since the days when guild wars factions was popular? There are extreme tensions in the realm of fusing asian cultures, tensions that were not there when guild wars factions was popular, tensions that now have a heavier bearing on NCSoft as the chinese government becomes more involved in the global gaming market. If NCSoft was a middle-eastern conglomerate, then this would probably have been happening to Elona and not nearly as much to Cantha. Its all very ironic, but very rooted in real life, and at this point id rather not see the game suffer because of it. i dont understand what more you want. Anet cant directly come out and blame China and NCSoft for not letting them expand on canthan lore, because it would hurt their ability to do business in china with GW2. Kongzhong would drop the game in a heartbeat if tencent asked them to, and then Anet would suffer drastically because the cash shop pay 2 win style of the chinese game market provides a hell of alot of revenue for Anet at the end of the day.
---
Who?
---
The "back to full focus on gw2" was a marketing speach and realistically a lie. They are already hiring for another background project. A studio that diesnt differentiate their portfolio is effectivelly digging its own grave.
---
There's an [upcoming event](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/catch-up-with-the-expansion-boost-special-event/) just for you and others who need HoT masteries (and PoF masteries also).
---
However it only starts on 3rd of Septermber...
---
Wait really? But I liked listening to these in the background while playing now and then :(
---
If you run a second character through the story again, you get to both experience those encounters again and get rewards from them, and you can even do them as many times as you have alt characters. 
---
I think those fights would be excellent Dungeon additions, but you know...
---
11:38 is the most important for new pvpers.
---
If you wann come the Guild is Open for everyone. The Guild is my own i build it solo and every one is welcome to chill in this Hall.
---
Write me ingame a message to LordGandalf.6407 and then you  get an invite.
---
No. You can play for free
---
I use the moon arc and the elgant walls. Also for the roof i use the zephyr Bridge.
---
Most of people who play gw2 are non factors.
---
If you can manage it, do Auric Basin meta.  Be at least 10-15 minutes early to Auric Basin.  It's almost always got a large enough players to do the event.  If you're late, you'll be in a useless overflow.  It grants a tremendous about of XP for the amount of time invested.
---
I never watched many of these, but there is no denying the situation is dire.
---
All I know is damn.... If all that happens on the 30th is a show case of living world season 5 without at the very least an indication of an upcoming expansion after ls5 of at least shorter release windows I personally am going to lose many friends and guildies.
---
There is many people outside of this echo chamber that are hanging the decision to continue on the 30th.
---
The boss trains still run starting with Tequatl typically; check LFG ~15 before reset. Otherwise just follow the event timers. Silverwastes is run very regularly, look for RIBA squads. Dry Top is less organized nowadays though SAND still runs their squads.
---
So you're saying that when someone reaches a decently sized following by making content for a game, they have to be positive about it even if that would be a lie? That's absolutely insane.
---
I'm going to miss TeaTime. It was the realest podcast about this game. No fake PR bullshit, just hardcore players talking about the many ups and downs of the game. 
---
The rest of the comments here really illustrate just how brainwashed the community has gotten. TeaTime hosts take a mildly critical stance on the content dripfeed from Anet and then get crapped on for it.
---
Link a clip where he says what you claim he does.
---
macros are allowed as long as they do not give you any advantage over other players in terms of skill or a automated process in the game.  
---
making a fastclick macro which switches your game settings to your preffered style in a second should fall under the rule, that its permitted tbh.  
---
just download autohotkey, get a quick guide and make one yourself...not really rocket science. you can even just record what you are doing and get the time inbetween out so its fast.
---
But the WvW and sPvP neglect in favor of casual content has been going on for years now. He has the right to think nothing will change with LS5.
---
&gt;Time for the subreddit to be happy about losing one of the biggest twitch representations 
---
Even though I kinda like Teapot and think the ERP is an amazing event, I wouldn't call this ''a lot'' of events, and to be honest I really don't think twitch as a relevant impact on the game's population/popularity. 
---
Even knowing and liking the guy, I only watched the first wing clears and ERP from him, and then most persons in my raid guild never even heard of him.
---
I love random conversations in map or say chat. It's even more fun when you get there in the middle of it, and have no context. Like when I went to Rata Sum recently, and as soon as I load in, there's "You're riding him" in say chat.
---
Everyone knows how I feel. The point is that in the past few weeks/month I have actively avoided expressing that in overindulgent ways. I've been keeping a high energy, meme fueled atmosphere going without getting depressed over the state of the game.  
---
The criticism was that I'm currently producing content stating the game is dead. This is just not accurate lol - watch the video! (or the stream)  
---
A lot of this particular video is some mild speculation and then it's us telling stories about our times in the game. If that counts as 'doomsaying' or 'bringing the community down' then I can't help you.
---
Replay it with another char and you even get rewards. (Most people play story content only with one char.) :)
---
BiK is an incel anyway...just have to see him on stream...this guy is gonna be the next walmarkt shooter
---
That sounds like a no.
---
rip just another sigh that gw2 is dying faster the last months.
---
im just wondering why not make another TeaTime for the big announcement on 30th (if there something bigger coming they your regular living story stuff)
---
You mean the Guildwars 2 mobile team?
---
It is pretty rare to find f2p accounts in maps, usually it is people with their first character. Everyone serious with the game has expansions.
---
GW2Effi has some stats, but this is just pretty small part of playerbase and many accounts there can be pretty old -&gt; https://gw2efficiency.com/account/player-statistics
---
Blame queen jenna.
---
I do the missions solo. The lowest journey you can do on your own also the mission where you have to finde one bounty you can do solo. And at least the races you just have to wait until a other guild start it then you start youre own guild mission and run with the other guild. When they are successful you get for youre own guild the success for this mission. 
---
I hope i could help you. I do it on my own and i think you can do it too :)
---
You said 'either' which suggests the original sentence was also correct. Surely you can see that is not the case.
---
Whatever floats your boat. If he doesn't like the game he can play something else. The community doesn't need him nor his entourage comprised of elitist jerks. 
---
They all should have left our beloved community long ago to never return. Things will be much better without his gang and they'll never be missed!
---
Why is he responsible for what other people do lol
---
too bad it's not just him leaving and that was hosting events, quick example was jaw himself doing pvp events and he moved on even before him
---
If you are actually serious about wanting to complain about rewards, then complain about repeat raid clear rewards, which are completely and utterly imbalanced...especially for something classified as end-game challenging content.
---
Lawl i was terrorozing him last week and now this, Bic u suck a ballz "pro gamer" :D.
---
Ranger is currently possible to be played in wvw though. It doesn‚Äòt bring anything but damage, but it can easily outdamage scourge and herald by using lb5 off cooldown. One or two good rangers are useful, but not 15 bad ones.
---
thats why he should have done the same like most gw2 players and not feature on teatime.
---
&gt;I'm unsure how to draw his glow?
---
You got the beginnings of it with the hair tips (leaf tips?) - Light pale colours surrounded by darker ones is the traditional go-to for rendering glows. 
---
There is a bunch of color theory about some colors registering in the brain as lighter despite having the same intensity but I can't be arsed to look it up and I usually draw pen &amp; ink anyway so I'm not the best one to speak on that.
---
Was he leading a squad to drop invisible boots?
---
We're all supposed to RP as WP w/ PMA PvP streams!
---
Oh poor baby did the big bad internet hurt your feelings?
---
I correct: 'My name is NCSoft and I am afraid that someone in China will find this offensive.'
---
By your logic selling raids should not be allowed either, as the player is not playing with the group, but is instead sitting it out on the side line to get the rewards without effort. At least the person doing the home instance farm actually puts in the required effort for the task(spamming F everywhere).
---
That's a good point of view. The problem was, in my experience, was when HoT was first released there were map completion aspects and personal story quests gated behind mastery levels. So despite wanting to do either I was forced to grind experience and the content did not have a good flow.
---
It can be done organically but I feel that the nerf was justified and made it better.
---
Listening to the podcast now, hope you end up doing more content elsewhere because it has been an enjoyable podcast to listen to even though I have dropped my interest in GW2 to the point where even if an expansion released on the 30th I would be waiting to see how it reviewed.
---
Even if Inks is right with their "the expansion will be a staggered release" I would probably wait a few updates to see how the general feel is past the hype generators. 
---
Weird fun fact, came to your channel and subscribed after I saw your bank storage statistics video years and years ago and thought "hey, be fun to see stuff like this pop up occasionally"... little did I know :P
---
To be fair that's what I did before and it didn't work. The only solution was to really open it and scratch the muddy dust life forms attached to each fan.
---
This type of dust was like a liquid yet dry kind of soft moist evolution of old dust, but it was still dust.
---
oof
---
Is it a buff of sorts? What's the duration?
---
Don't credit me but I think he mentioned trying to stream it and not liking it.
---
people have criticised the neglect certain areas of the game for years. usually they voice their dissatisfaction one by one, and promptly get drowned out here, on the forums, and pretty much anywhere else you can think of.
---
this time a major figure of the community, that many can relate to, is dissatisfied as well. people do not support through this because teapot encourages them to, but because they - to differing degrees - agree. veterans, end-game players, *"elitsts"* - whatever you wanna call them - flocking around him in this time is not inherently caused by him, but is a symptom of the long-lasting dissatisfaction many players have experienced for up to several years.
---
teapot mostly just fills the role of a coincidental loadstone, figurehead, and spokesperson for these players.
---
and despite that teapot continues to emphasize that GW2 is a great game and offers thousands of hours of fun to all those that aren't too hard-set on challenging end-game content.
---
"This item is not available to purchase in your region".  
---
Even the free one...
---
Would be nice if the item said how exactly the timing works.
---
That's fucking garbage if its a one time use. Damn, I would have considered getting it if it had been permanent.
---
What exactly does it do?
---
How did you stop from slitting your wrists? I don't see how anyone could enjoy themselves this this shit on in the background.
---
Are you on EU? Would a visit be possible? I can happily contribute with some gold for more building/decorating. I'm mainly looking for inspiration for myself.
---
Those fights don't really give rewards in the first place to be repeated for.  Given that, you can already repeat them for fun.
---
Which is why the blown up song and dance being made by people quitting is tiring.
---
We're on petty much the same cadence for releases (including raids) since LS3 Ep1. That's over three years ago. Some of us called it out as an issue then and have done ever since but now it's only a problem because certain people are quitting and making drama about it.
---
well oof, got any proof for the background project? like Hire postings and what not, could all end up being for a new Guild wars game. or shit even more for gw2.
---
Not always. There are some instances that don't properly progress for the non owner. Some of the HOT ones wouldn't properly progress the HOT elite spec weapon collections, for instance.
---
Gonna make a really, REALLY risky guess and say it's not gonna be worth it.
---
lmao
---
Wish we had the deco limitations raised, still only 20 local area deco limit and 2k max.
---
If you have alt-accounts, you can gift it to your main to get the unlocks there.
---
fck belgium right :/
---
lmao like this game ever had twitch presence, stop being delusional
---
Not time limit...it goes away when you spawn a Skritt from killing regular mobs that give xp...I killed 1 mob and one spawned
---
It has no timer
---
You said free, and then gave costs. What's free? And what isn't?
---
Started farming yesterday. It's so relatable ;_;
---
That's quite right.
---
I had Quip on my dual pistol thief.
---
Later changed that to dual H.O.P.E because of the plasma lights.
---
I'd love to have Quip sounds with H.O.P.E bullets
---
JPs are open world content, the very definition of group content.  Also, JPs are content, and are content that some people definitely need help with.  No one needs help farming nodes in their home instance.
---
Selling a permanent one would be financial suicide. Buy this one item to unlock all skins from the gemstore for only 2000 gems!
---
you get 1 for free
---
Gives you a buff that spawns a skritt when you kill mobs that give XP.  When the skritt dies you get a Recovered Black Lion Good bag that can unlock various account items (including mount skins).
---
A lot of the veterans who are currently leaving the game have ~10000-15000 hours on their accounts, yes.
---
10/10 predictions.
---
Useless.
---
Everyone can get one for free, and any additional ones cost gems.
---
You get one for free.
---
200 gems for an account unlock that doesnt include karma skins or dungeon skins...but does include mount skins....you're prolly right though
---
I feel the same especially with the massive event at the end of this month. I agree Anet is the best at communicating with their community, but most MMOs are bad at that anyways.
---
Suspicious package I got from one of the kills showed up in my chat but not my inventory. Dunno what that is about.
---
It's not my logic, it's Anet's.  Argue with them how raids aren't group content.  Have fun with that.
---
So is this just a guaranteed wardrobe unlock? 
---
Are you able to get more then one unlock per hunting bond?
---
I'll give a pass on most of those, but why the hell is the left most one not even trying to go to the center?
---
I have several f2p account and you have access to Silverwaste and Dry Top since both came out during the core game. You access the map through Brisbane Wildlands in the upper left corner.
---
You've just got to draw the line somewhere and realize that, unfortunately, jokes and memes are offensive to unintended audiences.  For a while over the past 2-3 weeks people have been spam-posting pretty cancerous memes here as a form of protest.  I wrote furnace !@#$%^&amp; in one of my comments yesterday and it was immediately removed by the GW2 Bot.  It's a lot of the same people.
---
Hey yea I‚Äôm on EU. Visit is possible the Guild is Open for everyone. You can write me ingame a Message LordGandalf.6407 is my Name :)
---
"Bleh."
---
Love it
---
Well, better hope there won't be and Trouble in there.
---
Is that why poeple care about AP? For the skins? I never worked out why I should care about my AP.
---
So you can unlock all of the skins in the game for 200 gems within an hour?
---
I got the arctic explorer outfit from my free one! Perfect for the upcoming icy living world season!
---
Scaled dragon wings glider you are miiiiine!
---
But the shit rewards from the bosses already do that? You get a handful of tokens once a day and then it's like a single token each fight.
---
Free one probably will be worth using. 
---
Just need some reddit slaves to investigate how exatly does it work, otherwise I would expect to waste it (and this is why this "trial" one is free).
---
&gt; There is many people outside of this echo chamber that gw2 Reddit has become that are hanging the decision to continue on what is said on the 30th. 
---
Have you been reading the sub? There are many people in the gw2 reddit community who are like this.
---
&gt; It has become a hard thing to watch, out of my 14+ years as a guild leader in the Guild Wars universe, I don't remember a quite this bad. Atleast after GW1 content stopped we had functional competitive systems and a future to look forward to in the next game to drive HoM goals.
---
Right now is a lot better than GW1 after EotN dropped. The GW1 updates were very few and far between before they stopped altogether. Right now is also better than the content drought between Season 2 and HoT or between HoT and Season 3.
---
Personally I don't want more seasons at the expense of another expansion (and soon) but I am a little hopefully Season 5 will basically be a free expansion that is staggered in release, with a big first episode (ideally with elite specs) and at least one new mastery. If S5 is just a slightly more robust version of Season 4 (say, every episode is like Jahai Bluffs) then I think a lot of people will find something else to do.
---
I really don't know what you've been reading if you think reddit is an echo chamber of positivity and satisfaction over GW2's current direction. Every part of the game has people concerned. It's a complete fabrication that open world players are somehow more satisfied than raiders or PvPers - I think a declining interest and increased dissatisfaction of content releases since PoF is universal. There are lots of happy and satisfied people across all game modes, but there are a growing number of dissatisfied people as well.
---

&gt;It‚Äôs almost time for the *Guild¬†Wars¬†2* seventh anniversary celebration, so why not bring along a dish or two to share with your fellow players? Go big with ascended-quality feasts that‚Äôll satisfy cravings for delicious food and combat efficacy. On August 27, you‚Äôll be able to level up your cooking skill to 500!
---
&gt;When you reach cooking level 425, Sous-Chef Seimur Oxbone will contact you to check on your progress. Impress him with your skills and he‚Äôll happily write you a letter of recommendation, sending you off on a journey to study with master chefs in every capital city.
---
&gt;While you‚Äôre leveling your cooking skill, you‚Äôll also graduate to a better class of tools and raw ingredients. Each instructor will help you obtain what you need, from a cutting-edge oven to high-quality meat and garden-fresh herbs.
---
&gt;#### Refined and Adventurous Tastes
---
&gt;Ascended food provides a primary stat, a secondary stat, and a passive or triggered effect. But that‚Äôs not all‚Äîyou‚Äôll also gain bonuses to experience points, karma, magic find, gold find, and World vs. World experience points. The benefits last for an hour, and every ascended meal is a feast so all your friends can grab a helping!
---
&gt;Tyrian cultures have their own staple foods and cooking techniques, and the master chefs you‚Äôll work with have developed innovative dishes and tools that play to their strengths. When you plan your picnic basket, make sure to include something for everyone:
---
&gt;* **Charr**‚ÄîPack at least one hearty, sophisticated meat dish, like a Plate of Peppercorn-Spiced Beef Carpaccio.
---
&gt;* **Norn**‚ÄîAdd some complexity with more protein and fresh vegetables. A Plate of Coq Au Vin with Salsa should be big enough to go around.
---
&gt;* **Asura**‚ÄîTechnology makes all the difference in preparation and preservation, and ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù is a great way to describe a Plate of Sesame Poultry Aspic.
---
&gt;* **Sylvari**‚ÄîNeed something light and refreshing to cleanse the palate? Serve up a Bowl of Fruit Salad with Orange-Clove Syrup.
---
&gt;* **Human**‚ÄîIf you didn‚Äôt leave room for dessert, say your prayers‚Äîthere‚Äôs a Mint Strawberry Cheesecake just waiting to be devoured.
---
&gt;#### Snacking on Stream
---
&gt;Get a head start on your cooking journey with Rubi Bayer, Clayton Kisko, and Patrick Bayles this Friday, August 23 at noon Pacific Time (UTC-7)! They‚Äôll roll up their sleeves and look at what it takes to make in-game treats on the official [Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/guildwars2/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/arenanetofficial/live), and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/GuildWars2/live) channels.

Better stock up on cauliflower
---
I'm actually really happy to see this. I was afraid that some of the selling points of living story 5 would be the 500 cooking/jeweler and legendary runes and sigils. The fact that they have been released now tells me that at least on the 30th we should expect some "new" news
---
You surely don't  think anet would do that do you?
---
Wow, the meme is becoming reality.
---
Sadly so, though I can't blame him. I've been subbed to his channel for over 2 years I believe, but his growth stagnated long ago due to gw2's inherent low vierwership on twitch.
---
Hopefully, enough of his viewers will carry on to watch him when he streams wow classic and he can grow his community and make a name for himself there. He will be a small fish in a big pond but the guy has charisma, experience, and puts in the hours, effort and soul into streaming. I know I'll tune in occasionally in my free time and he can count on my prime till Bezos decides to pull the plug.
---
Anyways, I hope my comments provide some content for his stream, though now that I've revealed that it was all sarcasm that might not be the case anymore.
---
I wish teapot good fortune in the wars to come!
---
I'd like to make the guess that this is going to be a bit like Consets where in GW1, where the raid leader might reiceive a bit of gold in exchange to providing the buffood for everyone..
---
&gt; Character Slot Expansion‚Äî35% Off
---
Take all my gems.
---
Saw someone in another thread confirm they are unavailable in Belgium, even the freebie one.
---
Gives you one pick from a long menu of [Outfits](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Lion_Outfit_Ticket), 
---
[Weapons](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Lion_Weapons_Voucher),
---
[Gliders](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Lion_Glider_Voucher) or
---
[matching Backpack/Glider combos](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Lion_Backpack_and_Glider_Voucher).
---
Minis :( So definitely not worth it
---
That's pretty exciting, I really do like the idea of a super expensive party wide consumable existing (ex: much like thesis of strength/malice... well before their price crashed). Something to put your money into if you are doing something like progression, records, or anything else you really want to push the most out of your squad for.   
---
I am guessing the food is going to be something like " +100 Power, +70 Conc, 33% chance for might on critical hit " rather than just picking 2 of those 3 buffs.
---
It really depends on your definition of "better". The game is suffering so hard because the game has no future at this point in time other than the notion of more of the same.  We have no reason to expect that LS5 won't offer the same complete in a week at most content over 3-4 months periods.
---
The hardest thing hitting activity right now is that this game has not future but more of the same.  Which is why the 30th is so important.  People are waiting to see Anet actually improve and pull out of this downward slide.
---
Since its not announced, its background project. No matter what it is.
---
wvw is gonna be fun
---
Was this a Futurama reference to Melllvar?
---
If you unlocked a lot of Black Lion Weapons and exclusive dyes then it might be, but if you didn't then it's terrible value.
---
This seems interesting. But also ANet pls bring back the Salvaged Forged gear I've been waiting patiently :/
---
Going to miss this. Teapot is/was a good member of the community, doing the ERP, mystic builds, gathering elitist toxic host. But the discussion about the game were interesting.
---
Would need a right-click "Preview" to see what it could actually give. If it's similar to a purchasable Guaranteed Wardrobe Unlock but with only random Gem Store items, it could be worth it.
---
That explains why all my cooking materials just got bought.
---
Some ppl don't fully think things out lol.
---
Enjoy government being involved in gaming
---
I got one too :D.
---
I'm offended by his lack of comedic value.
---
That does mean theres 10k plus hours of stuff to do, you can do everythign and see everything is much less than that. Thats allignoring afk time and time u simply fuck around with friends as well.
---
hard jebaited by the snakesssssss
---
If at first you don't succeed, add more Bloodstone Dust.
---
Yeah dude I definitely think it should be balanced at the exact same price point and time investment if there were a permanent version. Good call.
---
Would have made bank.
---
Weren't there rumors that he allegedly assaulted Miranda Cosgrove?
---
Yes nobody uses Thesis/Writs consistently outside records...
---
Attack it...it has like 10 health
---
They do. 
---
Source: I drop some on the boss every time somebody plays Weaver.
---
but i have still 55115 stacks of food from festivals...
---
I wonder why they need to release a loot box with extra steps. Maybe in preparation for new laws or something?
---
Then would it not be reasonable those hires are for Gw2. If so then I guess they weren't lying to us.
---
Ah, another gambling item.
---
Also don't get your hopes up, because (of course) this item will also drop you dyes that are worth absolutely nothing, something that anet *conveniently* left out of their blog post promoting how *amazing* this item is.
---
And would you look at that? I got a dye from the use, why am I not surprised.
---
Now what are the chances that you will get a drop from the 'good' stuff? I dunno. There are no indications, it just says 'well, you'll get something.'
---
iT's N0t G4mbL1ng!!! Congratulations players, you are playing yourselves.
---
But that's just loot boxes with extra steps.
---
He didn‚Äôt read your post. Or just wanted to hear himself talk when you clearly already said in your original. I think it‚Äôs a great idea level up another class you like and boost Druid as secondary character. Although as other warned you, my friend boosted Druid and he was overwhelmed at first. They dont have a fixed rotation to memorize like some dps, instead you have to read ALL of their skills and understand when to bring which skills in raids. I feel like if you just wanna play and does not like to read it may seem a bit tedious.  But you can always go for soulbeast in open world/pvp and Druid in fractals/raids. Very in demand class! Have fun man :)
---
So.. This is a quite big announcement, and they didn't save it for their Big announcement at the end of the month?
---
This makes me think their Big Announcement is Big enough on its own.. I told myself I wouldn't, but I just got even more hyped over it....
---
wow that's gonna suck. can't you make 1-player cheaper versions? why tf would i bother leveling cooking to 500 otherwise. what a way to introduce content that barely anyone is gonna use (scribing and lege runes say hi)
---
God that sucks....I assumed this was Anets way of getting around the gambling thing but I guess not.
---
We should go to the gw2 forums on the anet website and comment there, al base builders unite and comment on the deco limit threads!
---
If they don't make the crafting costs gigantic to compensate the fact that they're all feasts, then I'll gladly eat my words.  But usually with food you're just crafting it for yourself, I don't see feasts used much aside from WvW.  Feasts need 10 of the normal food item to craft, so I'm worried that the devs will figure "Okay, since these will be feasts by default, just make them costs 10 times as much as our initial estimates."
---
We've also already seen that lots of cooking stuff tends to get blown overboard, such as the meta Sweet and Spicy Butternut Squash Soup for some reason needing 10 Ghost Peppers, which is the primary reason that it costs so much to craft.  I like my consumables, but the thing is that if the consumable has an absurd cost to it, then it's not worth using in 99% of your play time.
---
its just another loot box.
---
It's not about it being trash, it's about it being so overwhelmingly depressing. I don't see how anyone could keep the game open while listening to it. I genuinely can't keep interest in the game because listening to the constant stream of "ANet's shit, everything's shit" just makes me feel like I'm wasting my time playing the game because it's 100% going to die tomorrow.
---
It's really not worth it unless you already unlocked most of the weapons and dyes. You are guaranteed a mount for 400 gems while these cost 200 gems and are most likely to give you a dye, weapon skin or mini pet.
---
If you are someone who has alot of skins to unlock then this item may not be worth it, but for some of us who only have 300-400g skins left to unlock it would be worth it, 
---
As it stands 200 gems it around 75gold, if you unlock a 400g skin its worth it, but any skin below 75g is a net loss.
---
For those who want to know what you have and dont have unlocked
---
 [http://immortius.net.au/wardrobe-unlock-analyser/](http://immortius.net.au/wardrobe-unlock-analyser/)
---
This feels like Scribing but on a smaller scale. It was already presumed that ascended cooking would be expensive but on top of that feasts tend to be expensive to make, especially if they're a BiS item. My concern is that this will end up like Scribing where Anet designed the costs with groups in mind, but in reality it's largely one person actually spending the resources so you end up with situations where one person spends hundreds of gold to make a handful of rickety chairs.
---
A system like this has the potential to exert extra pressure on guild leadership in addition to being a source of toxicity for pug groups. I remember back in Guild Wars 1 people could get very, very nasty in regards to the cost of consumable party buffs if their group was underperforming or if they felt other party members were leeching in regards to conset contribution.
---
On the other hand, these are only really factors if the power of the food itself justifies the cost. It might be the case that these items never become meta due to the cost involved, which would just be sad. I'm interested to see how this pans out, but from what they've announced I'm somewhat leery of what I'm hearing.
---
I remember it was badly paced with HoT, final step being gated after the top level Nuoch mastery that was otherwise uninteresting. It was overall not done in a good way, but the idea behind it made sense.
---
ANet wants you to buy more metabolic primer ;)
---
Mini rock !!! worth it ~ nope....
---
quite obvious that all these dishes require lots of cauliflower.
---
Excellent. That stuff looks great!
---
As I predicted, this item will give me only worthless crap I haven't unlocked (like any other wardrobe unlock) and I immediately got the proof I needed by unlocking the mini floppy fish from the free one.
---
thank you for giving me ideas
---
I do appreciate ANet's work, I just also want this new feature to be something that I'll use in my course of playing the game.  [This](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Griffon_Egg_Omelet) is my primary food when I'm doing open world stuff, and the reason is because it lasts an hour, gives stats that are useful for me unless running a condi build, and it's immensely cheap to use.  If ascended food costs a lot of expensive resources to craft, similar to [BoSaSBSS](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bowl_of_Sweet_and_Spicy_Butternut_Squash_Soup), then it's going to just go unused by the majority of the players.  I want to see something this cool actually be used, but if it costs too much to keep the effect active then I'll just be sticking with my omelet.
---
Can't believe a-net didn't add a Starborn outfit to the vouchers...
---
Kids ruin EVERYTHING
---
man blizzard must be ready to shut down wow after 15 years. \*phew\*. See here's the thing you cant call their intentions early. We don't know what they have in store.
---
You can always drop one before a meta event and pretend it will improve the 111111 :p
---
All of Tyria's heroes will probably die of heart disease because at least one of these will probably require 100 sticks of butter ...
---
Hero banners are basically free. I doubt that the food will be, just like the writs arent.
---
Smart use of flag poles as support pillars.
---
The game is saved, more power creed with Ascended Food.
---
It's not gambling if you can only win.
---
"Remaining community", oh fuck off.
---
It pulls out at least some vendor stuff and seems to limit to black lion/gem only
---
Aka, there's no T1 Soverign, no Carnival skins.
---
Okay, cool. If I use it, is the buff character-specific or account-wide though?
---
Read your and mine comments and then tell me who's being toxic and angry lol.
---
Why would I appreciate something that doesn't have a good impact?
---
Cooking is the ONE crafting profession I had genuine fun with. Looking forward to this.
---
Chefs unite!
---
&gt;When you reach cooking level 425, Sous-Chef Seimur Oxbone will contact you to check on your progress
---
*IT'S HAPPENING!!!!*
---
There is usually a lag on these things, similar to Birthday Dye Packs. Hopefully they'll add Starborn in the next year or so, as I refuse to gamble for it with Keys (other than my weekly farm).
---

If you have enough money to buy alternate accounts just to use their TP delivery box to hold stacks of food, you won't have any monetary issues to get Ascended food.
---
&gt; When you stop being a cunt.
---
That goes both ways, specially when you are the only one throwing fits and namecalling.
---
Do you have tempest unlocked already by chance?
---
Wouldn't legendary food have the same stats as the ascended, just maybe you can choose the stats?
---
Got some tentacle backpack, I can finally do anime roleplay
---
I got pretty lucky. My free one gave me the 2k gem shrine guardian skin.
---
It's not an Apple subreddit, we don't have to bend over and take it every time something bad gets released.
---
Godammit this was frigging amazing props to everyone involved
---
What if you get hyped and are happy with what they reveal?
---
Anet: \*announces something*  
---
GW2 community: https://i.imgur.com/u4UImm9.png
---
This doom and gloom is getting out of hand lol.  Are these all TPot fangirls?
---
yea of course, of course, everyone on this sub want what's best for the game, but for now, this thing isn't even out, we have almost no info on it. So let's just... chill
---
I don't think most people complaining here have bad intentions, but in the long run, intentions don't matter all that much. It's about how you're conveying them, and when. 
---
And when you come to this sub all excited to see people talk about this new feature, and the first thing you see is a thread of (mostly) ungrateful players, even if they'll be somehow right... It's sooo exhausting. And it's been like that for MONTHS.
---
Do you complain how they do less DPS and shame them for their food? ;)
---
I am, cause i almost unlocked every weapon and dye under 200g.
---
You know what every crafting discipline needs to reach lvl 500? That's right, Bloodstone Dust. Remember the guy mentioned in the article, [Seimur Oxbone](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sous-Chef_Seimur_Oxbone)? Yea, this is gonna be spicy. (And the food is gonna be just as useless)
---
If I recall correctly that was Linsey somewhere around the time that Lake Doric was released. Another developer had hashed out a plan for a fishing system back before launch but it ended up never being developed.
---
[You guessed correctly.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cdo9ts/mightyteapot_quitting_gw2/etw8cbt/)
---
Nah, potato gang for life fool
---
Isn't that due to a combination of how expensive they are and how difficult it is to keep their bonuses?
---
And also that there are a lot of other useful utility consumables.
---
It's almost like several major implementations they've introduced in the recent past have been major flops that have only heightened some players distaste for the game. Features such as the Warclaw, Legendary Runes, etc. highlight how out of touch Arenanet seems to be with the concept of enjoyability in a game.
---
piss off
---
I got the Northern Feather Wing mount skin for the griffon.  Not bad for free.  I won't be buying any though.
---
Anet is not blizzard. Never will be. You are comparing an ant to an elephant.
---
Illogical! Does not compute!
---
I'm actually hopeful of the announcement in all seriousness.
---
It‚Äôd be nice if it were in game yes but it‚Äôs already available through taco (weekly raids, daily DJ/and x/8 DJ tracker too).
---
There are apps for your phone that can do this as well as a Discord bot that can list it on command.
---
This would be an amazing way to bring back an improved Zhaitan fight (and Zhaitan mini?)
---
https://gw2efficiency.com/dungeons?filter.type=raids
---
Just use ascended toughness food. 4hed /s
---
Awesome intro I met u in a deimos pug I think u were coming back to the game at that moment ur pretty cool fella
---
yeah you can't choose what you wan't so by nature it's gamble
---
Yeah its crazy valuable in that light, and especially saving a huge hassle with the way the mount skins are done. It's such a small niche though it's going to be mostly a rip off for 99.99% of the playerbase.
---
I mean no you can't choose, but at least it's not on the level of rolling dyes over and over and not getting an exclusive..
---
Not long ago. Faction Provisioners did get an [update](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Game_updates/2019-07-30) 3 weeks ago.
---
No it's not, you cannot buy it with the voucher
---
That is not quite true. They are announcing it now but it is missing some details. The 45 minutes can be filling in the details.
---
Anyone else feel like ANET is encouraging us to clutter Tyria?  Giving us free banners from blitz events, and now adding several feasts to the mix?
---
Sooner or later you won't be able to chase Skritt Burglar without first tripping over a hero banner or stepping on a plate of dolyak steak &amp; mushrooms.
---
Most of the free gemstore items can be gifted.
---
Depends what he has unlocked in the first place. Very biased!
---
Hallelujah. Maybe I‚Äôll treat myself on payday then!
---
When I'm out of space mid-instance, I just mail 5 things to my friend and ask them to return to sender.
---
Hopefully this will give more value to the lesser-used cooking materials.
---
Fire up you glyph of the herbalist and fill up the mat storage.
---
It‚Äôs listed on the Wiki for the Backpack/Glider combo voucher. D:
---
[Here.](https://media.giphy.com/media/bz7Lkscqm6mrK/giphy.gif)
---
They could hold them until the 30th, but I would expect the stream on the 23rd will be where they fill in those details.
---
Hey, from all I know that its bigger than the last few releases for the game. albeit I'm a WoW vet that game is far worse of but has the numbers to stay afloat. Me and ton of my Friends who followed from ESO and WoW see no problem aside from the stores questionable from time to time. All I'm arguing is that calling what they've said lies is far to soon.
---
people with gambling addictions / children
---
I am JUST now realizing that my expectations for this item were thoroughly confused because I misread the data mined name as Knife Tail Gang Hunting BOARD (clearly similar to Black Lion Hunters Board and the like) instead of Knife Tail Gang Hunting BOND.  At least that context makes more sense now...
---
oh yea I didn't mean they were being a cunt, but more like, a general "you" of the community
---
Oh that‚Äôs fair! I‚Äôve been MIA for 3+ years so who knows what is end up getting.
---
This is effectively a lootbox except it's dressed up with legs. Lootboxes will always be effective on a certain type of person.
---
yeah fuck belgium for wanting to protect its citizens from predatory practises
---
Something like the challenge log from FF14 would be neat. Would be a good way to bring back monthly achievements (or weekly instead) as well.
---
However more than half of the loot involve BL weapons and dyes you can buy on the TP.
---
I'm glad you are quitting.
---
BL keys have loads of extra crap.
---
These are actually a great deal **IF** you are one of those people who wants everything or most of everything in the gemstore for whatever reason.
---
i hope you hoarded lots of bloodstone dust for its culinary applications
---
it's not clever at all
---
I mean that comment right there is pretty toxic but ok den
---
There's no culinary use for bloodstone dust!
---
no gw2 fanboys just blindly defend the game and compare it to the worst possible games like ones made by EA
---
Its a skritt it even says it is.
---
But it doesn't matter, it will suck because reddit says it sucks :cccccc darn....
---
quite sure those details will be revealed once it goes live next week before the announcement...
---
How is that a predatory?
---
Are you cigarettes next to the candy or something?
---
Celestial Rooster glider, a damned dye and Marjory's axe. :I
---
right, I have almost no gemstore minis ...
---
You prefer to pay for a random chance at content?
---
I'm sure there is a playerbase willing to pay for it, I certainly am.
---
Unfortunately there are many people whom have openly stated they only play this game because it's free with no sub and I'm sure such update would create a gigantic uproar from them.
---
50% of the unlocks are probably minis.
---
I wanna see his goofy ass mongo hand again
---
No, just content.
---
Selectable stats and tiny versions of food floating around you for its duration.
---
You're the toxic one.
---
Yikes.
---
Yes Anet go back on your business model that you've had since 2005.
---
You also get a free one if you bought GW2 prior to F2P
---
sorry princess but your medal is in another lootbox
---
OMG new hairstyles?!?!?  HYPE!!!!!
---
is it only unlocking one item? so you have it active until you unlock something, right?
---
It's basically everything except the newest stuff. They update the list every once in a while. For example, the Shrine Guardian outfit was added last week.
---
The item gives only items from the gemstore if accurate description. So excluding exclusive dyes (which idk if is a part of the drops?), there's probably only 10 or so items under the value of 200 gems.
---
The big question here is who the fuck serves Coq Au Vin with salsa?
---
I'm not inherently off put by the clash of cultures, but that's the sort of nonsensical combo served up by a culinary hack who thinks every plate of food needs a 'balance' of flavours. 
---
Well you're not being "innovative" or clever, and you're not balancing shit. You're taking a dish which has rich, subtle flavours and all the acidity it needs from the wine and vinegar (that is unless you under acidify it just to try and justify the salsa's existence). Adding salsa to the party is like attempting to round out an acoustic folk trio with a set of bagpipes.
---
Whoever came up with this combo is a fraud and I reject the notion of them being a "master chef".
---
This sounds incredibly stupid
---
Sure.  The free players likely are not buying goods from the Black Lion store anyway, so nothing changes for them in the case of a premium sub.  The difference is that by taking away loot boxes, Anet would not be engaging in the predatory cash shop practices that have plagued the gaming industry the last 10 years.
---
wurth
---
Got the Summit Wildhorn with the free one, not bad.
---
Don't you phones have guys?
---
If we all just walk around in Nomad's or Settler's then I don't see what the problem is anymore.
---
Given the distribution to the unlock prices, it may be worth it if you have all the cheaper unlocks already. If it‚Äôs a binomial distribution of some sort (two humps, one large cheap one and smaller very expensive one) then the expected value may make these worth it. Lots of assumptions in my statement though.
---
When it first came out i was grinding gold and got up to 800 gems, then i went on vacation and i have no time to get it again... Rip
---
mean i kinda like these's over the black lion keys, atleast i know im gunna get something lol
---
They better not use Bloodstone Dust as an ingredient.  That stuff‚Äôs inedible!
---
oh no !!!!!
---
Anet would probably make more money if they allowed more purchase amount options. 
---
Then again, with the current state of the gem store, a lot of the time we have to buy more than what we intended to buy to get certain things.
---
It‚Äôs no different than keys.
---
Same thing as black lion chests.
---
oh nooo, not a lootbox again, fck Anet &gt;:'(((((((((((
---
For now :D
---
They must obey their master, NCSoft.
---
I'd be more interested in the sales they're doing if they were AFTER the aug30 announcement. As of now, my wallet is closed off to this game until I can say it's not dead with some degree of confidence.
---
So a couple could be more than 2?! Ha, im not so crazy after all!
---
That could work, I mostly suggested solo content as those instances aren't necessarily balanced for groups, and it gives an option for leaderboards (guild leaderboards) and time-based competitive PvE content, using the trappings of Adventures or the Training Golem to provide a timed trial.
---
This would primarily be a UI investment. (A portal like the Fractal one where you select the story boss you want to chalkenge) and it provides practically 1 new instance with every living world release. And about 10 to start with.
---
They could even make the requirement having finishing the story once on your account to avoid spoilers when new content comes out.
---
The LA crafting stations are so cool looking!
---
they said BL items only right?

Realistically that sounds a bit less bad as it looks like it's 1 other project as opposed to what sounded like several other projects so hopefully some ressources will be less spread out.
---
Spend 15‚Ç¨ a month on the cash shop and you got your sub.
---
With the anniversary next week keep an eye out for sales.

---
&gt;, if ascended had its duration increase by a couple of hours
---
Anet kind of backed themselves into the corner with this by making "food effect extension" fall under the purview of the gemshop. If ascended food was just ordinary food with a longer duration, it would be way easy for everyone to just calculate whether it's cheaper to buy a utility extender (whatever they're called) or craft the food, since at the end of the day, a 4 hour effect (or whatever) vs a 24-hour effect is pretty indistinguishable for most people.

As a new F2P player, what do I need to buy to have access to WvW? The cheapest way :) 
---
Thanks.
---
Not surprising, Anet's not going to touch that voodoo legacy code with a ten foot pole, and rightfully so. But it'd have still been nice. God knows, maybe someday the re-do them from the ground up with up-to-date code.
---
don't be mean to anet, if you ass-hat freeloaders don't buy these lootboxes the devs will literally starve
---
After Scarlet's disruption of the ley lines, it probably points to the nearest Elder Dragon.
---
Is it pointing towards the endless sea by any chance? Asking for a friend.
---
If only they got updated to have bounty boards like PoF bountes so you don't have to waypoint all over the place hoping to get one up.
---
On the bright side, you got a 350 gem item out of a free version of a 200 gem item. That's technically a profit.
---
well same goes for mailcarriers and minis then... and all the skins below "your" desired worth.  its like you said its a gambling item and not a something to gift you expensive stuff for low money.
---
I bet you legendary food would work like that but it would have a one hour cool down lmao
---
You get an who-can-eat-the-most-in-a-given-time-PvP map.
---
&gt;is a big feature
---
no, it is not.
---
Yes, absolutely. It‚Äôs really how I play the game, and have done for years. What isn‚Äôt so cool is that they have slowly been shifting more and more towards exploitative tactics in the shop. Random mount tickets, the usual BL key stuff, and now this barely hidden loot box replacement of the hunting bonds. 
---
I love the company and I love what they do, but exploitative cash shops just suck, there is not way around it.
---
Bounty boards would be a nice addition to core maps.
---
no, Anet is the evil incarnate because as we know, the only thing that drive people is money, and true devs should just let their subscription-free MMO die rather than trying to find economical alternatives to keep it alive!!!!!
---
&gt;I don't know how you play the game, but 55s for one half-hour consumable is pretty expensive for me.
---
The BiS power food is more expensive than that, friend.
---
&gt;Considering the average skill level of the people whom I usually play with in group content
---
I am just looking at gold values for all BiS food and giving an objective opinion, not gonna take into consideration everyone's biased averages.
---
&gt;every food is a feast
---
Oh, so they're all going to be stupidly expensive and nobody will bother crafting them? Cool, thanks for yet another good-idea-ruined-by-terrible-execution. Add it to the pile.
---
^i ^hope ^they ^make ^me ^eat ^my ^words ^but ^im ^not ^going ^to ^get ^my ^hopes ^up
---
Congrats!
---
Heh ... that would also make the gold to gem exchange more expensive which has the added benefit of making buying gold from them more appealing
---
Lots of cheap dyes and weapon skins, and also quite a few 150gem headpieces actually which are less awful but not ideal.
---
When you‚Äôve been a max chef main for years and this comes out.
---
*heavy breathing*
---
The last reward chest in ranked gives 20 gold and is repeatable. It‚Äôs not faster than actually gold farming but most people who play ranked PvP actually enjoy PvPing and would play it if it didn‚Äôt give gold so it‚Äôs all just a bonus
---
Your last begging thread was removed, so you thought it was wise to create yet another thread begging for handouts?
---
Is the Recovered Black Lion Goods an item that you can redeem at your leisure, or is it an immediate redemption upon looting it?  It'd be great if you could save them up and use them after you've unlocked a lot of common stuff.
---
It would spike, sure, but then it already does whenever new goodies appear on the store.
---
I would challenge you to find an individual who has organized more significant events in the community. No, Wooden Potatoes has not produced as much quality content as Teapot. WP has more of a quantity over quality system on his channel.
---
This is more important than build templates
---
The difference is that for people who have problems with impulsive purchases (which cash shops are essentially design to exploit) there is no direct temptation to keep buying more and more keys, boxes, etc.  Instead, the rng is shifted into the game, with a set cap of what you pay per month. You can‚Äôt pay more for better odds, you just pay once.
---
&gt; do we need more powerful food?
---
It's probably not even going to be that much more powerful. If it follows the pattern that gear does for Exotic to Ascended, we're looking at maybe a +10 to the primary stat above normal endgame food.
---
No if living world launched in 2013 with a season pass sure but living world is meant to be free episodic content. Also it goes against Anets philosophy of free updates. Yes Expansions cost money but that more buy to play but GW2 and 1s selling points is once you buy the game thats you you don't need to pay for anything else except expansions.
---
Not seeing it in the [outfits](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Human_male_outfits) or [any](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Human_male_light_armor) of the [armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Human_male_medium_armor) [galleries](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Human_male_heavy_armor).

RIP Snek rekt by a casual
---
Your government is trying to protect you, because it knows your needs better than you do!
---
Hmm I have watched a lot more cooking videos than that so I guess that might be okay
---
... who am I kidding. I'll just wait for someone to write up a summary instead of sitting through whatever the presentation might be. I don't have to the patience to sit through this sort of thing.
---
If you have all the cheaper unlocks it is worth it for sure if all you care about is value and not the items which you get. It's better value than black lion keys (For wardrobe unlocks) to unlock everything.
---
There is no denying that they tightened the screws on the cash shop, but GW2 is still hilarously undermonetised compared to other games. While that doesn't make things better, it does put them into perspective.
---
They also fixed a lot of bullshit. Chests are better now than they've been ever before, thanks to stuff like statuettes, the removal of several extremely low value drops and the implementation of stuff like unlocks.
---
But the biggest plus is, that this skritt thing isn't a loot box. The chests are a loot box. You get absolute crap 99,99999999999% of the time with a small chance on a sparkly thing. Hunting bonds are wardrobe unlocks, which can be manipulated by the player and have a genuine worth to them. It's still RNG bullshit, don't get me wrong. But as far as RNG bullshit goes, *this* is definitely high quality work.
---
Roaring Dragon Glider was a BLC exclusive and is not coming to the vouchers. Gotta buy it with statuettes or get it through GWU.
---
&gt; make the games adult only
---
Well, you know that does not work in some/most societies. Technically you should be adult in most countries to use mobile device app store (having debit/credit card on your name). Does it stop parents giving their card to make account for kiddo? 
---
And blasting this shit with a nuke at this point is the only reasonable solution since nobody just want let it go... Making honest fully fledged media experience for fixed upfront fee is normal, not dumb.
---
I‚Äôm happy you want to be pay for content - so do I. What I don‚Äôt want to see though, is my fellow players, some who have real problems resisting the temptation of impulsive purchases, be exploited by poor cash shop practices. I‚Äôm a huge fan of Anet and the game that they‚Äôve built, but wanting them to improve their business practices isn‚Äôt at odds with that.
---
&gt;      
---
&gt; I am in the same boat. My raiding (and occasional fractal CM for some people) static originally had not just 10 core members, but also another 4 "second priority" people who regularly raided with us on the side as substitutes, and the discord probably had a further 10 people in total who raided with us occassionally.
---
There is a lot of guilds like this. Or rather, there were a lot of small guilds like this. Obviously Teapot never talked about this, because SALT is a mass guild; and it wasn't a problem for hardcore guilds either. But there have been actions taken by anet that absolutely destroyed these small guilds. And it was pretty terrible.
---
It's the same story every time you join the recruitment of a 9-15 people guilds.
---
If it's good enough for Princess, it's good enough for us.
---
WoW classic will be great for GW2 I feel.  Basically a trash boat collecting and removing all the driftwood.
---
And if it‚Äôs anything short of something insanely grand then this game is doomed to slowly sink into the mud. Hype culture is irrelevant, if we don‚Äôt have something really big to shake things up and draw interest then the game will have its course set on failure.
---
I don't really get why people call a season pass a subscription? The only difference from an expansion is that the content you paid for takes, say, a year to roll out. It's still B2P though, they wouldn't take the content away from you if you didn't renew.
---
More like a permanent increase to the minimum.
---
Well shit. I hadn't even thought about it like that yet. Guess so?
---
People angry about no new end game content in GW2, moves to Classic WoW where no new end game will be developed.
---
after years of fighting with microtransaction I came to conclusion that other people problems are not my problems; if they want to pay gambling money to the house and I get free stuff in the process - it's on them to get help, not on me.
---
I'm not actively annoyed that legendary runes are in the game or that ascended food will be in the game.  I am annoyed that Anet seems to have prioritized them over build templates.  Both of those features seem aimed towards hardcore players.  The same players who have been begging for build templates for years.  Build templates are the number one thing Anet could do to get me excited for this game.  It feels like these 2 updates are aimed at me, and they are just missing the mark and prioritizing the wrong things.
---
I never tried to use a VPN but I did now and it worked so thanks!
---
Oooh I'd like fishing. I hope that happens at some point!
---
Kind of a fair point. I can only talk for me, and for me it isn't of any importance if I pay 30‚Ç¨ per quarter or 10‚Ç¨ per month. Yeah, I still have it if I stop paying. But not paying at all beats it every day of the year. I'd rather let people buy pretty skins from the cash shop for continued development. And everyone who keeps bitching and whining about OmG CasH ShOp can just buy shit worth 15‚Ç¨ a month and call it a day.
---
You typed the core of the issue and didn't realize it. It is a gambling item.
---
Such a let down after Meta Event Rush and the World Boss Rush that both was easier  to attend and easier to get boxes..
---
Deliver 2 things to give fans false hope.
---
Is there a non-healing support build that can permanently provide Fury and twenty-five stacks of Might for five people and maintain decent stacks of Vulnerability? Maybe rifle deadeye with Fire for Effect? Anything else?
---
&gt; I wonder what was the target audience.
---
For a change, veterans - who already have all cheap stuff unlocked.
---
&gt;  this is probably for WvW where like 30 people eat from it and make up for the cost.
---
But every role in WvW also uses different food?
---
Honestly if they were able to have expansion level stuff I wouldn't be against small one time charges.
---
Like say the main story is free but you can pay XX$ for a side mission that unlocks an elite spec, or other expansion type stuff.
---
If they did it that way they might actually end up keeping the player base happy and making more money then they would normally because you could just buy a couple things or all of it.
---
That would get allot of the free to play people to consider dropping a small amount of money to unlock some stuff.
---
No I'm going to guess you are a veteran of the game. If living world from the start so flame and frost was marketed as being part of a season pass it would be no problem. The issue is they come out just last year in the Anniversary festival Z said "we look forward to continuing to bring you free episodic content" to "oh we know living worlds been free for 6 years but as of season 5 you need to pay". This community will go "wah wah your breaking your promise of free episodic content Anet can't be trusted". Also expansions bring in a lot of money they won't stop making them.
---
You know what people say about Fortnite? Yup...
---
IMO consumables are too expensive as it is. They should all be absolutely dirt cheap IMO. It should be absolutely nothing to be fully buffed all the time.
---
aww shame :(
---
I mean these were promised in April. Also the 500 cooking is coming in August not July.
---
*NCSoft wants to know your location*
---
and why is that?
---
&gt; This event doesn't seem to be appreciate :/
---
That's cause its a trash event. A event tailored to make us run around and find champs is not fun or enjoyable. With World Boss/Meta Rush we know exactly where to go. Champion Rush is a bad event and hopefully Anet never do it again.
---
No, it just tells how strong nostalgia can be. Once they realize how outdated a 15 year old mmo is, they'll leave.
---
Old phalanx strength warrior. Condi fire tempest is also capable of doing that.
---
Vuln is usually provided by everyone in the party.
---
I beat Liadri and pretty much everyone else with my personal offshoot of condi berserker (basically just condizerker with an axe instead of torch, sometimes defense instead of discipline for harder fights, and different skills instead of banners, of course). I used dodge food for Liadri, which was a godsend.
---
Turai was much more difficult. I tried with spellbreaker, then DD, then mirage, then finally got him with spellbreaker again. I think my build was GS and D(or axe)/Shield, with Defiant Stance, Endure Pain, the Dolyak and endurance regen signets, and the elite signet, with defense, discipline, and spellbreaker traits.
---
It speaks to how starved people are for content when increasing a level cap for a crafting skill is a ‚Äúbig‚Äù update.
---
is only the person who got the item able to get the loot? i imagine anet already thought of this and put in something to stop it, but could you get a group together and take turns spawning the skritt for everyone to kill?
---
And that's why people whant Cantha.
---
Who the eff was that person complaining the ENTIRE video and shutting down everyone‚Äôs comments with this deadpan voice? The video was so pleasant to watch with people mixing in humor, serious reflection, and overall good podcast-like quality. Then there was one guy who just have no social cue and say something super negative after anyone says otherwise.  It really ruined the mood and dynamic of the conversation for me. 
---
On a second note I don‚Äôt know who teatime is but he seemed pretty cool and lead the conversation well giving each person an opportunity to speak. It‚Äôs sad he leave and i look forward to new community personalities to rise up!
---
"Omg why cant you be positive about something for a change? This sub is just whining about everything."
---
on point
---
Because gating consumables behind a gold cost/grind doesn't help anyone.
---
this
---
Still banned in Belgium, so I guess it doesn't even pass for the legislation.
---
The more annoying thing is, ANet keept putting out packages which include Keys, Dyes, etc. making them banned by default. Even the RNG on Mount skins screws us over. In theory, if you buy the 30 or whatever max unlocks, you'd "get them all", no RNG involved. BUT, since this is still sold as a one-by-one, they're all blocked, and only the Mount Select licences are available, at 3 times the cost it would take to unlock them all.
---
Instead of trying to bypass legislation, maybe anticipate that bans like this may spread in the rest of the EU and devise a business model on that.
---
best video 10/10 !! love it!
---
It's similar to the arena, capricorn and foefire. There are less and less large maps and more and more of these small team fight maps.
---
I honestly did not remember that the Aspect Arena was part of this festival. Why is there no daily achievement for winning a game?
---
Certainly the casual nature of the game makes it crap to stream but it doesn't mean it can't pull people in. sPvP tournaments organized by the community (with little to no advertisement from Anet) get 2.5K viewers sometimes. Same for the raid tournaments. 
---
I believe if there were better incentives, streamers would at least stay connected, instead of dropping the game entirely. 
---
Anyway the numbers I pointed out are an average, over the last year, way more reliable than a few check ins.
---
I seem to remember the map being specifically excluded. Guess we can't have nice things
---
Why use the word ‚Äúpromise?‚Äù This is a problem to be sure.
---
Use a VPN?
---
Where is the content?
---
The mount is necessary to enjoy the game. At least PoF in my opinion.
---
Sorry to be salty but...
---
All of these fight were not interisting because new elite spec allowed to rekt those boss without challenge.
---
The only one i had some issue to deal with was morder one because i was a core guardian at this time and there was no checkpoint for a long time....
---
Dude just look at the kralky fight... If you die there is a waypoint at each phase of the fight like wtf where is the challenge in that ?
---
Why would you think there won't be a third expansion?  Game companies like money.
---
I‚Äôd love to see a source for that statement? I‚Äôve heard that before, but no body has ever provided a source
---
I thought about that the moment i read "killing stuff that rewards xp". Sadly Anet did not.
---
Rebuild the Sanctum and have it float out somewhere over the zone so you can fly to it
---
Guess what I got with my freebie!
---
The devs cant even keep the same stance on something for multiple years, a while your name is fine, the other you get ban, a year later someone else use that name ahahha. During that time may I remember everyone we cant dye underwater headgear
---
If only they didn't nerf the old Queensdale champions into vets...
---
The real crime is the Legendary Bandit still gives the same crap loot. Its a great fight and a lot of fun but it takes awhile. All that work for 1 champ bag? Its really not worth it. Would be nice if they got their loot updated.
---
It's random with a weight towards garbage like minis or finishers. There's not really anything to "waste" unless you want to spend several thousand gold on unlocking other stuff first.
---
How did they not notice to turn that off?
---
It's been fine with previous BLC items due to them just being loot.
---
They must just not play PvP because this is a huge oversight
---
I imagine it's generally cheaper for Anet to just exclude things from Belgium than going to legal every time they come up with a new RNG gemstore item to see if it wouldn't be scrutinized by the law or not. So whether or not the item does pass legislation, they probably don't even try.
---
I agree it'd be better practice for them to just sell stuff in more optimal manners. It reduces backlash (like when the mount liscence was first made; or now), it avoids potential future legal issues, and it's just generally morally better.
---
Sadly, lately the video game industry in general feels like it's gone to join the majority of other huge western inudstries where they care more about profit than the well being of those they profit from or have working for them. Not surprising - that's capitalism for you.
---
But you can do that already, it just wont be the bis food/utility. If you want the best possible buffs its perfectly reasonable for them to cost something.
---
Yeah, but for Black Lion items exclusively it seems, so no risk of getting that regular Steel Sword you forgot to unlock.
---
At that point in time I though that some thoughtful activity might be involved. Like you'd need to actually find the skritt, or something.  And you could actually fail to get loot from it.
---
But no, it just spawns right next to you and doesn't consume buff until it is killed.  Foolproofing in action.
---
Kill mobs of the beaten path. The longer a mob has been alive the more exp it gives when killed so killing yellow mobs around the map gives alot of exp
---
Nope, unless you have most "cheap" stuff unlocked. I got two Black Lion weapon skins, which is alright, I suppose, but I wouldn't spend any gems on them. The worst part of the box are the minis and mail carriers imo.
---
ArenaNet has yet to do this so I don't see why you would suggest it
---
It took me a while, but It wasn‚Äôt too hard. You have to climb as high as you can on the skyscale, then switch to griffon on the highest point after using bond of vigor to get the extra 2 wall jumps. Then you kill some time flying around until bond of vigor comes back up, switch back to skyscale and latch on a tree trunk to jump and climb a bit more. Takes some patience but you can do it! :)
---
Yeah Anet how dare you make governmental decisions like this we all know you control the worlds governments. I have never seen a more idiotic post ever getting angry at Anet for following the laws of a country.
---
&gt; You will also have the opportunity to learn how to code by making your own fake chatcode ping app!
---
This is part of the reason why the lfg is dead now. People like you ruining experienced groups by fake linking leading to people not wanting to form pug group or join them.
---
Then you come and complain about LFG when you're the core of the problem.
---
Better treasure hunt rewards. Not worth the time invested unless you need the daily or you find it fun to jump around aimlessly.
---
Treasure hunt is just a couple of silvers at most. Bundles of loot should at least be able to trade for festival tokens.
---
Boss blitz should have like two more champ bags and/or zephyrite boxes on top of it. At most the blitz had one LFG instance at prime time.
---
It felt like the festival held back on rewards this time. Since it is just temporary I believe anet can afford to be more generous.
---
They could add an incentive for buying the complete pack from the Guild Wars 2 Online Store (similar to an expansion) instead of the Gem Store, but that would be weird. LWS5 will almost certainly still require Path of Fire purchased, so I don't see that happening.
---
Add some sort of "Box" to the event. Similar to Trick or Treat Bags or Wintersday Gifts. I think having a bag/box for every event is a good way to entice players to keep playing that content. If the rewards are good enough players will keep repeating content to earn them.
---
Speaking of festival bags, I have another "What would I like to see changed". It would be nice if you get comparable amounts regardless of what you do. With Halloween everyone does the lab because its the best way to earn them. Why does the JP or anything else not give decent amounts? With Wintersday its the opposite. The JP is the best while other ways are horrendous. Would be nice to play the game how I want and still earn good amounts.
---
Basically yes. The buff means one chance the skritt will spawn. Then you kill the skritt and it drops a chest, which is the unlock for one item.
---
It also doesn't give you duplicates, so you're guaranteed to get something you didn't have before.
---
Either treasure hunt made into an adventure so we can do daily without waiting up to 2 hours, OR moving the Favor to something else so this daily is not "mandatory" anymore.
---
&gt; **SOME world bosses count**. Notably Shaman, SB did not.  
---
Shadow Behemoth technically isn't an NPC, but an object. Same with all "epic" ranked bosses - Tequatl, Shatterer, MK II Golem, etc. They're called "prop bosses" because their visuals are technically part of the environment, and the targetable stuff are technically objects.
---
The world bosses that count are all champion and legendary NPCs.
---
&gt; **Ascalon -** **\*\*Plains of Ashford\*\*** 
---
Plains of Ashford only has one champion, I believe: Siegemaster Lormarr. Not exactly a good farm. Like Queensdale and other starting zone, 95% of the champions (all but the world boss-related ones, and Lormarr) were brought down to being vets.
---
Fields of Ruin would be a better map to farm, as it has 3+ easy champ spawns off the top of my head.
---
&gt; We'll pay a monthly Premium
---
Nope. That'll destroy the game.
---
Yes, people like me who have never played raid XD nice bullshit here mate
---
When do you pick? From a reward box or what? I mean, could you just not choose and wait till something you want is added?
---
They accented multiple times that season 5 will be free in same schema as previous seasons.
---
That does not mean they won't come with something like some pass, they experimented with such in previous months. But it was never blocking the gameplay.
---
Yes, people like me who raided with guild and quit when legendary armor came out XD nice qq here mate, wanna share some more bullshit pulled out of your ass?
---
I got the Tremer Armadillo off of my free one.
---
What is this? An image for ants?
---
&gt;So the post above you is comparing them to another enhancement item.
---
No, it's not, it's clearly talking about **consumables**.
---
&gt;Latter lasts an hour, but to me at least the extra +20 Power and +10 Ferocity isn't worth costing 20 times as much for the same duration.
---
And that is fine, I am just saying BiS food that already exists and is extensively used in PvE endgame is more expensive than writs themselves. It's not a debatable thing, it's a Tradepost fact.
---
Actual bullies are you. Anything outside your "safe friendz zone" is toxic lol
---
You think they would leave this till the announcement show.
---
Unless what they have is even more amazing.

---
it fuels the market behind the ingredients/materials that are tied to them. People make gold out of "expensive" food and the tradepost removes some of it through taxes.
---
It's healthy that things have a price, that applies to real life too.
---
So we should all sit happily and keep feeding ANET with feedback such as "game is great and has no problems!"
---
I'd love to see them turn the guantlet arena into a guild decoration (or a guild building on its own, but that's less likely. Just make it float in nothingness idc). 
---
Each boss in the open-world arena would then drop tokens to allow you to unlock the same boss in your guild Guantlet.
---
The white mantle flair is hilariously fitting.

Raiding was already dead when I quit it 2 years ago. Change my view.

Put your finger down your throat?

It was Anet's decision to implement it as a gambling mechanic.

Some new plants for my plantman would indeed be quite the addition.

god dammit, I thought it was the shinning blade one. I've been repping the wrong flair for about 2 years now.

Mmm, cauliflower-based cheesecake.
---
I don't get why he didn't have teatimes way less frequently. Even when there WAS a bunch of new content and changes, he should have only been doing them once in a while. Literally no podcast survives on a single topic, even podcasts that are about like a single TV show, they get new episodes and new seasons all the time, and when they don't the hosts straight up just take a break and only release a new episode if there's some actual serious news.
---
Same. Had people ping for a CM training run too, like really? I'm showing a few guildies, this isnt going to be pretty.
---
gw2 is the best single player mmo.
---
there are easier ways to convince ppl to abandon the game
---
[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior\_Rune\_of\_the\_Nightmare](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Rune_of_the_Nightmare) is still very sought after
---
Also in WVW. We were fighting the three teams at the same time and I met two of them. I was confused.
---
It is ~63 Gold if you buy the 15 package (160 Gems).
---
If someone plans to eventually get all skins it is a really good price for lets say the last 50 skins and still worth it for the last 200.
---
Sad, it looks really nice.
---
Assuming there‚Äôs no cool down on the chest drop, the best map will be whichever allows you to do the most champs within a given time. I also vaguely remember dungeons being viable for the only monthly but I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre a part of this.
---
Well considering 500 cooking is gonna be released on the 27th it would be weird to have more details on it after we have all the details....
---
I'd rather get rep grinds that nothing at all. As long as they aren't a mandatory pain, they could be a good way to make experience points valuable even after you max out masteries.
---
Ah interesting. I immediately thought of WvW as well when I first saw them in pvp. At least the abnormality is consistent
---
How do we know that the recipes up to 500 aren't single player versions?
---
Leaving it between Orr and the Sea of Sorrows would have worked too. I don't understand how the story department let them put it there.
---
The cross-section of people that would be extra hyped by build templates but don't use arc is pretty small I'd imagine
---
aaaarrrrgggh i just bought two character slots and used them like 2 weeks ago
---
&gt;Disable boons as a baby dolyak so you can't cheat in the Flying Dolyak race event 
---
This point serves to prove people are going to tryhard literally anything as long as there's a leaderboard on it...
---
It's a matter of time now. Eventually more countries will adopt the same stance on gambling with digital goods, and companies will change their behavior to stay profitable in those big markets.
---
Oh my it only took anet how many years to up chef to 500?  4 years? 5?  Gimmick bs
---
Gambling with extra steps.
---
jeah its a gambling item, but I dont see something wrong with that
---
this is because the announcement on the 30th will only be for living world. they will need 45 minutes to properly sell the new direction they are taking the story in, everything else thats been neglected wont be a part of it if this is how they are handling things that the game desperately needs other than story.
---
It's so convenient to quote yourself where it looks good.
---
Not like it matters, the whole discussion won't be any different because of a technicality.
---
Do they ban all ingame gambling or just gambling that is more explicitly tied to real world currency?
---
Sounds reductionist, but killing any mob is gambling for an item. Not arguing for any side, but there seems to me that there are shades of gambling.
---
They experimented on Secondborn. Prior to that the Asura only captured one Firstborn (can't remember who).
---
No idea either. It was just such a complete blunder. 
---
Honestly, I wish they'd just retcon it. I really don't care if one day it's moved to a better location. It's such a stain on the world map and none of the narrative surrounding it makes sense. So there's just a brand new uninhabited island with unique flora/fauna that isn't tainted by Orr. . . . right in the sea that is constantly traversed by all the pirates and traders abound? It's immensely dumb.
---
Yeah for sure that's on my list! There's a lot of rally point and defense events north of the map that has me curious. Excited to see what happens. It will either be miserable or amazing. 
---
1) for open world, do whatever you want, although higher dps definitely makes the game easier
---
For instanced content, about 80% of a party will be DPS, 20% will be support, plus or minus some
---
Druid, firebrand, renegade, chrono are all viable PvE support builds, often paired up druid/Chrono and firebrand/renegade, who prioritize healing/buffs over pure damage
---
Tempest and scourge are secondary supports with high carry potential but they aren't always the first pick. And scrapper...is weird, and only really sees play in PvP/WvW game modes
---
2) yes, but more people do map meta events now like tarir and dragonfall
---
There are still squads that run bosses though pretty regularly
---
3) since level/gear cap haven't increased, all you need is to have gear that would have been viable years ago (exotic/ascended) to resume play. Just jump back in, get used to your class, and you'll be fine.
---
Legendary food idea :
---
THE LEGENDARY SCHOOL CANTINE
---
Would spawn a big cantine self with a bot like job-o-tron with a cooking hat serving the food.
---
Then everyone who comes to grab the food can select between many buffs from ascended food.
---
Then u can create 5 or 6 different legendary foods that give different kins of buffs.
---
Like a kinda food truck like asurian style could be nice.
---
I think it would be very nice because having a legendary skin on something else then a weapon or an armor let's Anet create things with big animations.
---
I'm not sure if infinite use is better then a cheapper consummable.
---
Since there is no wardrobe for food it can work as a 15 gold item with a 1 time use.
---
Im so sick of everything in the game being buy content and loot boxes, how about actually putting rewards in game, ya know from actually playing?
---
If this is how its going to go and only get worse, im out. I rather pay a sub fee and get a massive amount of game content and skins and mounts from playing than have to buy everything in a game that dont add anything without a catch to it.
---
Huh?  It literally tells you what it does lol.
---
There‚Äôs not too many BIG guilds for PvE that I know of (All I do is PvP and WvW) but there are many PvP and WvW guilds that get together weekly. If you run around Lions Arch or any of the big cities you can probably run into groups scattered here and there. 
---
The living stories take some time but they‚Äôre well worth it especially if you have the DLC. They give you mastery points &amp; cosmetics that you can only unlock through story completion so you can make your character look all fancy. 
---
Try to find a guild that you enjoy spending time with and that will help you through, there‚Äôs plenty of them out there :) 
---
I‚Äôm getting a new PC this weekend finally so I‚Äôll be back on Guild Wars if you want me to help you out.
---
I mean yes we need some more actual content, but this is adding and codifying a whole new set of food buffs. It's effectively a system overhaul and calling it a simple level cap increase is a very incorrect picture of it
---
In the fourth one I used the order of whispers backpiece, that's all. I don't enjoy wearing glowy outfits for a long time, it takes away the immersion for me.
---
This makes your initial claim seem really biased. You have no evidence it would lead to ‚Äúoverwhelming losses‚Äù you just don‚Äôt like the idea personally.
---
My guess is, the package is a container for the BLC thingy, it executers a script to check if you have the buff on you, if it does it gives you the item and decrements stack.
---
Tbh no festival evolves drastically from year to year. Fot4W is a relatively new festival, remade and released only last year, so I don't see the incentive. Halloween on the other hand is around for years, and only big addition was one small map for racing last year. SAB, Wintersday and Lunar New Year didn't get anything noteworthy (not counting races).
---
That's not really what they mean by an ingame reward.  There are no mount skins directly acquirable like elite specialization, raid, WvW, PvP, or even dungeon armor and weapon skins.
---
Laughs in alt accounts.
---
Be thankful op i wish they would ban them here.
---
Alright, noted, thanks, I'm still looking for feedback. When I went to Fields it was pretty dead, so I assumed noone was doing Champs.
---
Yeah...it's just dark
---
People still pretend it's about gambling?
---
Amen to that. Scummy game companies all of them. They no longer make games for the players, they make games to screw the players.
---
The comment.
---
Bandit Executioner also counts.
---
When I checked the price for [Writ of Masterful Strength](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Writ_of_Masterful_Strength), which MajesticNoodle was likely referring to when they [said](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ct1iyq/party_harder_with_ascended_food/exi18ct/):
---
&gt; Yet nobody uses Thesis/Writs consistently outside records...
---
...it had a buy price of about 59s, I rounded down to give the benefit of the doubt. I then linked that specific writ in my next comment, which you then replied to.
---
Considering your replies in the rest of this thread, I will no longer be replying to your provocations.
---
A user named [Faelys](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Faelys/Champ_Rush) on the Wiki compiled an extensive list of possible Champion-rank enemies, if anybody wants to look through and plan their routes.
---
I agree, almost all of my friends already dropped out and if anet doesn't pull something a bit more innovative than this 3-4 month cycle of LS maps that are all basically the same they won't be coming back. I'm not sure if new elite specs would cut it if they don't bring any captivating content with them to play through
---
Oh no, please not MORE tokens x)
---
i want to tell my friends who rarely log in about this first-one-free but i already know theyre gonna get shit cuz they all opened their first black lion chest already so their true rng has triggered and now they wont get anything worth while lol
---
Sad thing is, I likely would be too. /sigh.
---
But i thought there were no culinary applications for bloodstone dust!
---
My friend says "What's wrong with feet pics?"
---
I tend to agree with you here.  Underwater content is cool in concept, but the execution in game could use another rework.  I still think it'd be an interesting experience to have a world boss underwater though. 
---
I'm not sure how your idea would work without some kind of cannon in place to shoot at the thing.  I've been playing a lot of sword/sword and staff Herald recently.  All melee.  Unless I were to swap to hammer or Renegade for short bow, idk how I'd be able to damage Drakkar.
---
In ranked pvp is there a limit to how many people can queue together on the same team?
---
I often read the terms duo or solo queue in posts, and vaguely remember I was in a party with a friend and a third wanted to play and we couldn‚Äôt so all this time I just thought you can only play ranked alone or with two people. 
---
Then yesterday for the first time I saw three people with a linked parentheses at the end of a match and had a mind blown moment. I quickly went to google and couldn‚Äôt really find any answers to triple or group queue. On the wiki there were no mentions so I was wondering if anybody could enlighten me? Sorry if it‚Äôs a dumb question I just never thought about it or had two friends to play pvp at the same time. Thank you!
---
WvW always seeks to gain every advantage you can
---
this isn't anet's fault
---
I only started watching him recently (I didn't care before he starting getting loads of hate), and yeah, it's bad losing someone like him.
---
I think [this clip is spot on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw7cXXNCh84&amp;t=7497s). I pretty much have the same opinion as him, so that resonated pretty well.
---
GW2 is a sports car in a parking lot, and it's really sad.
---
I hope it doesn't go down on history as an isolated occurrence, much like GW1 did, and GW2's legacy gets to shine in the future properly.
---
You can delete this thread now I think they just did. Character slots and blc keys coming up :)
---
How come you're the top comment, but when I made three threads suggesting this exact thing, people kept downvoting?
---
Huh, so there *is* a culinary application to Bloodstone Dust after all...
---
Would you really like to pay gems for an item that can fail and give you nothing
---
Definitely message back here for me when you find a game like that, because even WoW right now has an angry playerbase wondering what their sub fee is even doing for them lol
---
Good guy Anet; protecting Belgians from Anet's predatory surprise mechanics.
---
Already bought all items you could get from guaranteed wardrobe unlocker up to 10g, so at least these items wont show up for me anymore :)
---
No worries, you just miss out on dyes and mail carriers.
---
If you can get a big enough group to force spawn new instances this can go very fast but this is probably not worth the effort
---
If I can find the drive to go after another legendary it's gonna be H.O.P.E. You simply can't turn down dual plasma pistols.
---
Haven‚Äòt watched the video but you clearly described Brazil.
---
If all relevant countries did it, gaming companies would give up. Now only belgians suffer, because true rulers of the world are corporations.
---
Use gw2efficiency (with your API) and the wiki. Always do mystic clovers first, cuz you get other mats out of it too
---
But mostly minipets
---
Thanks I missed that about season 5 being free. Good to know. I bought LW2 as I was on a break when it came out and bought both expansions so definitely would support the game with paid content. I had read that next LW wasn't tied to PoF so wondered.
---
The way is lit. The path is clear. We require only the strength to follow it.
---
Welp this just got an NSFW tag. What the actual fuck really? Next time I'll post an ankle and I'll get completely censored here.
---
&gt; I was just wondering what should I have before I get started to make the process a bit easier?
---
The only thing you "need" is patience. Legendary crafting is a huge process the first few times around and its easy to be overwhelmed and trying to rush it down imo just leads to more headache and burn out for you. 
---
Search up the leggy you want to make on the wiki and use it as a reference for what you need to craft the weapon. The wiki also is also nice because you can follow the links to help figure out how to acquire most of the items, like mystic clovers or where to buy obsidian shards etc (wiki doenst really list best ways to farm tho). Gw2 efficiency is another great site for leggy crafting as it has cost break down and you can link in your api so it includes the mats you have in the crafting break down.
---
It's so obvious now, just liken not being able to access lootboxes to the holocaust!
---
Ehm, I'm niet sure that I follow your train of thought.
---
Imagine if Dhuum CM had a 10 minute pre-event instead of 2 minutes. It's frustrating and discourages people playing the more difficult content.
---
Wouldn't you say that players wanting tot beat a difficult challenge without a reward at the end the opposite of players wanting rewards without any challenge?
---
https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-04-16-speaking-with-guild-wars-2-developer-arenanet-for-the-first-time-since-the-lay-offs
---
&gt;(But now two fairly big unannounced projects have been cancelled - big enough to have occupied 143 people, anyway - how does ArenaNet go about following Guild Wars 2? Can it now cope with a theoretical Guild Wars 3?
---
"We've always got - we're always working on some other stuff," the ArenaNet PR said.
---
"Every studio does," Murdock echoed.
---
"It's the way you future-proof the studio," the PR said.)
---
what was the highest discount yet?
---
you can also park then on daily chest to get some extra money to pay of those slots over time
---
I only started watching TeaTime regularly this year, after finding out that all these people are basically echoing my own opinions on the game state. Nobody's gonna care about what I say since I'm a nobody compared to these guys, so it's been kinda redeeming/reassuring to listen to these podcasts and feeling that I'm not alone. Still extremely sad how things are turning out, I hope 30th is NOT the doomsday, I hope to hear about an expansion being planned, I hope Teapot, Jaw and others reconsider and come back eventually. I fucking hope.
---
I too would like to see at least a couple of basic options for mount skins. At the same time I understand the need for the company to make money, so it doesn't bother me too much. 
---
I accumulate enough gold in-game that I find myself converting it to gems every few months (I'm by no means rich, but I've already got the Legendaries that I really want, so I need something to spend the money on). In fact, I just spent 2,000 converted gems on the fairly mediocre Warclaw mount set, since I'm primarily a WvW player and got tired of waiting for them to go on sale.
---
If someone really really wants a skin, then they need about 750 gold max to get it (2000 gem Armadillo comes to mind). That's a lot of gold, but something you can easily earn in a few weeks doing RIBA for a couple hours each day while watching Netflix. Me, it takes longer, as I am in WvW, and the rewards kinda suck there.
---
Good.
---
FeelsGoodMan 
---
PepeHands
---
widepeepoHappy
---
the only one playing pvp is ben so i guess that answers it
---
the masteries to craft leggie weapons for starters
---
Items deemed to be lootboxes are banned in Belgium, so you could find which items those are to see what's categorized as such. Sorry for not providing you with the list directly!
---
The choice doesn't affect season 4 at all, so it doesn't matter who you choose in PoF
---
Gem Store items rotate in and out of availability. You can check the history of availability of each item on the [Official Wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Main_Page). As mentioned in another reply, items like the [Black Lion Outfit Voucher](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Lion_Outfit_Ticket) also allow you to purchase out-of-rotation items. Their wiki pages also show what items can be purchased.
---
I hope that this won't require an expensive amount of materials like previous crafting upgrades.
---
just play the game, earn gold and buy gems...
---
It‚Äôs true. Anyone who‚Äôs ever been happy has died.
---
I got a [Mini Piglet](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mini_Piglet), for 0 gems and it is worth 400 gems.
---
Well, to be quite frank, the GW universe isn't going anywhere. It had lot of stuff going on during GW1, but GW2 became stale quickly. There's just no feeling of "world", there's nothing to look forward to, there aren't overarching plots or mysterious places we're itching to explore.
---
I wouldn't say we need a new IP, but the GW universe sure needs a restart, or a rehash of sorts. I still want to see sylvari and charr, but at a different universe. For example, GW3 could happen in the Mists, and instead of a solid world like Tyria, we would have like isles from different locations and timelines floating in the middle of space, ala fractals, but in the size of regions or even continents.
---
*banned*
---
Ask support. They may refund the difference.
---
Disappointment, but with extra keystrokes.
---
She has a steady job now, why do you think she will ever come back? *Gasp* Don't tell me you thought she did it for fun?
---
how is pepe alt-right?
---
Haha, idk, it's been quite a while. Maybe she'll come back, but we'll never know..
---
If it's close enough you can always try mailing support and getting the difference in gems back.
---
I was thinking of some sort of harpoon carts.
---
Leveling up through wvw is a terrible idea. Your gear and experience is far worse than most of the players there so it'd be pretty hard for you to do almost anything. Not to mention that lack of mount (PoF expansion required) makes it even worse.
---
Going to wvw before 80 is generally very stupid unless you have tons of experience with other MMOs and pvp in general.
---
So, until there's some sales on expansions, I'd suggest doing pve and getting familiar with general game mechanics and class(es).
---
Well, there are [a number of bloodstone foods](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sous-Chef_Seimur_Oxbone) in the game, but the point is that they're all(?) bad for you.
---
It makes AFKing a bit more fun and reaching some high places less obnoxious compared to springer/griffon/both.
---
&gt; Part of me thinks its because they drained resources from the game that they ironically looked at the game and said it doesnt have enough resources to justify continued development
---
Classic ArenaNet.
---
RIP old Kessex Hills :(
---
FeelsBadMan
---
there is, the descritpion says that mounts and some weapons are less common
---
Damn. Were you born retarded, or did your mummy drop you on your head as a baby one too many times?
---
Maguuma's full of alt right hate frogs. Close the jungle down, Anet!
---
We can talk about the most recent conte- oh wait
---
It's like buying a Black Lion Key but then having to farm mobs until the lootbox drops and you can open it.
---
Basically added extra steps to normal gambling to try to hide it a bit more.
---
Yeah the AoE skills -or lack of- is easily the biggest hindrance underwater.  If the devs find a way to incorporate more skills, it probably wouldn't be as bad.  Idk, maybe turn AoE circles into bubbles?  Kinda dumb but that is all I can think of to implement those.
---
I actually didn't know that about Renegade. I haven't played the spec in quite some time now.  I'm gonna have to jump in a lake and see for myself lol.
---
Thanks you both
---
Diessa plateau ranges from level 15 to 25, so certain areas of the map are meant for level 15 characters and some for level 25
---
The stuff at your level is in primarily in the top left corner I do believe,
---
There are no dungeon/karma skins.  The only things available are from the gem store (and a few older, otherwise discontinued items like Fused and Sclerite weapon skins that existed before Black Lion Chest weapons did).
---
All the gemstore-exclusive dyes are in there, though, and some of those are low value, so it's still possible to get something 'bad'.
---
Does that make Guaranteed Wardrobe Unlocks a lootbox within a lootbox?
---
I guess somehow these vile and predatory business practices are popular enough cause more and more game studios are implementing them.. But this is getting ridiculous o.o not only do they expect you to pay, they also want you to FARM... Something they've been actively killing for years now, has legalizing weed really been a mistake? Or are they taking stronger drugs?
---
I got the branded scepter skin, not bad.
---
In fact; forget the blackjack!
---
\*FeelsBannedMan
---
If you were able to properly comprehend what I said in my original comment, then you wouldn't have found the need to make your original statement, nor this.
---
So the crime is flooding/spamming the chat, not for using a particular emote... right?
---
If someone had spammed it with fishes instead, would they have been banned?
---
Pessimist me: gambling addicted/susceptible people / collectors with shopping addiction
---
Optimist me: completionists who minmax
---
So I‚Äôve got mixed feels on it.
---
Try telling certain people here that hearts are nothing but quests by a different name.
---
They'll fight you tooth and nail over that.
---
For me, it made me do more in game because I couldn't get free AP any more.
---
whats best farming spot for spawning the thing?
---
I know right? How awful that we are expected to pay for content! /s
---
Also, as for getting stuff playing the game? You already do get lots of items in game. Someone even did several posts on just that issue.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cnm14q/a_thorough_overview_of_rewards_part_ii_gem_store/
---
tldr. Their are plenty of items you get in game by playing.
---
I agree about the blc's though - I don't like gamble boxes of any type. But, I never buy them. *shrug* One gamble box in a game that has plenty of other ways to obtain items seems fair.
---
You don't even have to spend real money - just grind gold in game and convert to gems.
---
Thanks for your response, I think I'll probably wait some time to see if down the line they make more sense for me but yeah they're too expensive for something so simple, if it were something like $5~$10 I'd be more inclined to bite the bullet.
---
Funny I feel the same thing about you. You obviously have no clue what I'm talking about.
---
I see what you did there and I love it
---
Yep, pretty much.
---
"But you don't need to talk to NPC to get the quest. Other MMOs are so much worse."
---
Slow Mode exists for a reason.
---
What you're "talking about" has nothing to do with what I said, besides using the term "casual".
---
You can't blame the players for how they react to the game. If the developers add a thing that requires a certain amount of ingredients, and only so many of those ingredients exist in the economy, then the price for those ingredients will rise. If the devs do not want the prices to rise, then they need to either not require ingredients with low availability, OR they need to provide low cost faucets for those materials during the initial rush, like having a ton of these material dropping from some special event at the same time as the demand for them is increased.
---
I dislike the 50 AP annual achievements (of all festival events). If you miss one they are more or less gone forever. Sure, you can catch up when others reach the limit - in 20 years...
---
Intention is obviously to give veteran players a reason to participate again in such an event - but imho would it be better to simply raise the cap of those 25AP repeatable achievements each year. New players can then "power farm" their way to 50, 75, 100 or whatever amount of AP, while veteran players just have to reach the increased cap of another 25 AP.
---
Rewards for queens gauntlet should be increased (more tokens).
---
Add new rewards for tokens. Maybe an old BLT weapon skin set or a new weapon collection. Tonics only isn't that great.
---
At leisure

The interesting thing about early asura-sylvari relations was that all asura, not just the Inquest, initially thought little of the sylvari and experimented on them as they believed them to be simple plant monsters. That's why in Season 2 we learned via a flashback that Vorpp, a heroic asura who had helped us against Scarlet Briar in Season 1, had been experimenting on Secondborn sylvari (such as Canach) in the past despite not being a member of the Inquest...and after most non-Inquest asura had already realized sylvari were sentient and had returned Malomedies to the Firstborn. There are bad asura elsewhere than just among the Inquest as we learn in asura personal story that most if not all of the Arcane Council is corrupt, and the amoral and opportunistic High Councillor Flax is bent on asuran world domination when given the chance.
---
That personal story and Season 2 stuff makes me hope that one day we explore the schemes of the Arcane Council and asuran society more (with Phlunt ironically being one of the more moral members of the council because at least he came to our rescue at a pivotal moment in Season 3) and we get to stop Flax's schemes one way or another.
---
What I find particularly interesting in the [Dream and Nightmare](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dream_and_Nightmare) article (which has a short story detailing the first Secondborn Cadeyrn's fall to Nightmare) is a bit of text showing Trahearne's reaction to Malomedies returning to the Grove in a malformed and injured state due to asuran experimentation. Given Trahearne's characterization in the personal story, you would think he'd be like Aife and Kahedins and support peace with asura as the hero he is, but instead we find a darker, angrier side of him that is hinted there (and which was later hinted a bit more in Season 2 due to his desire to have his revenge on Mordremoth for what had happened in the Grove in Season 2):
---
&gt; "We must kill them all." Cadeyrn's eyes flashed dark gold, and his hand clenched around the hilt of his sword.  
---
&gt; "The asura have offered peace. They did not realize that he... They thought he was simply another of the strange plants of the deep Maguuma, mimicking sentience," Aife told them. "When they realized he was truly aware, they returned him to us."  
---
&gt; "It is not enough! How will Malomedies find peace if he does not take revenge?"  
---
&gt; Kahedins stared disapprovingly. "Revenge? Revenge is not our way. Have you not studied Ventari's tablet?" As the secondborn lowered his head belligerently, Kahedins lectured, "It is written, 'The only lasting peace is the peace within your soul.' You should meditate on that, Cadeyrn, and consider its meaning."  
---
&gt; Cadeyrn glanced at Trahearne, **whose expression was as black as his own.** No soldier would say such things. No one who had ever lifted a blade to stop oppression, or placed themselves in danger to free innocents, would say that revenge was unfitting. If Faolain and Caithe were here, they would argue his side, he was sure of it.  
---
&gt; Abruptly, Trahearne looked up toward the spreading boughs. "Yes, Mother," he answered a whisper only he could hear. **Chagrined, the necromancer unclenched his fists. "The Pale Tree says we need to concentrate on our true enemy: the dragons. Every ally will be needed." Gritting his teeth, Trahearne finished, "We make peace with the asura."**  
---
&gt; Cadeyrn was not sure what was more troubling, **that Trahearne had given in** or that the Pale Tree had spoken only to the firstborn. Following suit, he bent his head. "As the Mother wishes."  
---
There's a fun asura-sylvari partnership with the cynical [Jeek](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Jeek) and the idealistic [Ailionora](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ailionora) in Snowden Drifts. Jeek has some interesting dialogue on why he tolerates a nature-preserving sylvari in his presence:

&gt; **Jeek:** Ah, Snowden Drifts. A land teeming with resources and test subjects to be exploited for the greater good. Such a wonderful place.  
---
&gt; **Player:** Does your companion share your attitudes about this area?  
---
&gt; **Jeek:** Ailionora? Let's just say you can take the sylvari out of the tree, but you can't take the tree out of the sylvari. Her feelings about using these animals for the greater good is downright na√Øve.  
---
&gt; **Player:** If you don't like her views, why do you travel with her?  
---
&gt; **Jeek:** Are you snowblind? There are dangers around every corner in Snowden Drifts! Having a towering giant of a woman like her around is worth putting up with her annoying attitude.

One of my favorite asura-sylvari banters takes place near the asura gate in the Grove as a sylvari succeeded in short-circuiting the poor asura's golem and even confused the asura himself by asking some very important questions:
---
&gt; **Gate Assistant:** Your golem is strange. Was strange, rather.  
---
&gt; **Gate Engineer:** You drove it away, you know. I've never seen a golem run that fast.  
---
&gt; **Gate Assistant:** I only wanted to ask it a few questions.  
---
&gt; **Gate Engineer:** Oh, I know. You guys are full of them.  
---
&gt; **Gate Assistant:** Oh, yes. What it's like to be a golem? Does it dream? Does it have a family?  
---
&gt; **Gate Engineer:** That was the last straw you know. After that question about turtles in the desert, you asked it about its mother.  
---
&gt; **Gate Assistant:** So?  
---
&gt; **Gate Engineer:** It doesn't have a mother. It's a golem. You crossed its circuits. I don't know how you did it, but you weirded out MY golem!  
---
&gt; **Gate Assistant:** So, you are the mother? Or the father?  
---
&gt; **Gate Engineer:** What? Well, I‚ÄîI guess I... Oh no. You're not getting in my head. You just stand there and help me monitor the gate.  
---
&gt; **Gate Engineer:** Am I the mother? Blazing braces, this is what I get for working with the tree children.
---
Ruby Red for me :(

Put your lumps of mithrillium in a bowl of milk and enjoy

I was saying there was no need, during this particular time on this particular reddit for you to single out casuals at all, since it's already a clusterfuck. Your use of the term casual is exactly what I'm talking about.
---
Clearly you had to make 238 avocado toast.
---
I find the community in-game to be remarkably friendly (especially compared to the other MMOs I‚Äôve played before settling on this one). Mapchat is generally pretty wholesome, outside of very specific circumstances. 
---
PvP is more toxic, of course... but even there, I don‚Äôt think it sinks to the level of, say, WoW‚Äôs PvP community; a neverending maelstrom of pure hatred. I find a lot more pleasant people in my Unranked adventures than unpleasant ones, but that‚Äôs just my personal experience.
---
As far as I can tell, most of the toxicity in this community is found outside of the game, on Reddit or (gods forbid) the official forums. It‚Äôs a lot more rare within the game proper.
---
I‚Äôve bounced around a lot of MMOs over the years, and interacted with many MMO communities. This is the only one of them I wouldn‚Äôt describe as completely insane.
---
It's gonna be fun when people start with copy-pastas.
---
Actually one of the beers for the eldvin monastery brew of the month club uses bloodstone dust, which gives a slight tingle. It's called Bottle of Bloodstone Orange Summer Ale, and it comes out every June.
---
Mod has point that brainless spam does not contribute anything though. Chat is place to ask questions so they can be answered in stream, it is pretty annoying to search for legitimate discussion in flood of useless messages and such moderation is correct. Both from point of streamer and viewer. It just makes better to disable chat completely as spammed it does not add any value. But maybe some slow mode would be enough? (how discord has, one message each 2 minutes or such) Honestly, claiming that twitch was made for mindless spam is degrading whole project.
---
However, he totally dodged the pepe question, pointing towards banning *all* emotes being their practise....maybe it is coincidence that people spam only pepes right :D
---
Quite a bit of the food already does that
---
&gt;They aren't "thinly veiled lootboxes", they're just "lootboxes".
---
Completely agree. I would bet the average gem value of the rewards is pretty decent from these. The thing is, you don't get to choose. It's just like mounts, where you get to obtain things at a lower price point if you are willing to put up with RNG.
---
Highly praised micro shops like Path of Exile do the same thing already.
---
Thing is, the reddit is geared to whine endlessly, so that's all we will see here.  They don't even care about addiction or gambling, they just want to whine.
---
My favorite though is people who act like the living story is something unique to GW2.
---
They don't have 3 effects for sure.
---
I love that build &lt;3
---
How does this work actually? I use the bond, and find the Skritt location on map?
---
We are all friends!! unless you dont let me do what i want to do!
---
It definitely does.  And with room to dive at the start, the griffon will cover the distance much faster, too.
---
The advantage of Skyscale isn't going over flat terrain or covering horizontal distance, it's being able to gain height while flying.  A Griffon can only do that in very specific situations where there's room for a big dive initially.

---
Of course Black Lion Chests are worse and should not be supported either. But as you already pointed out they have been in the game for a long time, there is no point in talking about them again and again. The bonds are new, so it is worth pointing out that they fall into the same category.
---
&gt; Was it always in a massive skin box the first time they released Warclaw skins?
---
Yes it was.
---
It's amazing that when ANET had the design a weapon contest , you couldn't make any reference to drinking, drugs and gambling yet all of these things are in the actual game.
---
That sucks. There are only like 3 skins worth buying. I'm sure they just forced the other terrible skins to make it seem like a good deal.
---
Just ask Pok√©mon!
---
Depending how you look at it, can be considered as such I suppose.
---
You can also enter Diessa Plateau from your home city, the Black Citadel.  Entering from there will get you into the lower level area of the zone.
---
Honestly I hate the rule "you are not allowed to critizese mods" with a passion. No matter if its on 4chins, reddit, or your own forums it always brings up the worst in moderators and makes them immune to scrutiny.
---
What's the hardest material to get, aside from buying them?
---
WHY ARE SYLVARI EATING FRUIT SALAD OMG, ITS CANNIBALISM!!!
---
Because that's how they decided to sell it. 
---
Retailers, both online and physical, do this all the time. 
---
This is nothing unusual.
---
They set it up like that because they expect people will buy it.  If people don't buy it, then they'll change their system.
---
My Warclaw is happily unskinned.
---
Griffin also feels less clunky and more agile, it's my favorite mount for quick and efficient map completion, skyscale is handy in some cases but I'm not a fan of the sluggish movement and constant wall sticking...
---
One of the best skins imo, grats!
---
I'm gonna use the free one only. Gotta save my gems for that sweet, sweet character slot expansions and Total makeover kit sales.
---
I find that questionable. Adding legendary runes first only makes the entire system more complicated.  If build templates only work with legendary gear and legendary runes, then they will have really missed the mark.
