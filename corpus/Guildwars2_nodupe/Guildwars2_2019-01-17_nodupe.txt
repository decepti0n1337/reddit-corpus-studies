LS2 probably isn't worth buying unless it's a great deal or you really want to see some story issues.  There weren't any new maps with it (I believe Dry Top and Silver Wastes are in base game).  The LS3 and 4 add a lot in terms of maps and things to do.  Just my 2 cents.
---
A guildie asked me if I was the one that sent this potato.
---
I feel like the fact neither of us was sure until I actually read the message is an indication that maybe I send a few too many potatoes to other players.
---
^(For clarity, it turns out I actually *wasn't* the sender of this particular potato. A+ to whoever did, though)
---
That rant is pretty shit and he isn't objective at all.
---
Amazing comic. My charr and sylvari are suffering from lack of good looking shoulder bads.
---
*something something only consistent thing is inconsistency platitude*
---
We do, it's the last boss in the Nightmare fractal! (Ensolyss)
---
Of course! Don't you?
---
How is it shit and not objective? He is reading straight of the tool tip and give you the exact numbers and how you can use the skills.
---
Wow. Thats a lot of health coming from traits. Which runes?
---
3. Most dungeons can easily ve cleared with 3 people (exceptions are crucible of eternity path 1, 2 and 3, twilight arbor aetherblade path and citadel of flames path 1, due to mechanics, that require more than 3 players to handle). The only requirement for that is, that you know, how the dungeon works and being practiced in the combat mechanics.
---
Midichlorians
---
1st thing that jumped out at me too
---
Thats literally what I said. You can't stop them from doing the damage.
---
To get your first mount, you literally just have to complete the first instance of the PoF story, so that's pretty easy to do. 
---
I'd prioritize gear first, before mounts though. Getting properly geared up in at least exotic level gear with a build that makes sense will help substantially as you go through HoT and PoF because of the difficulty spike from the core game. 
---
Other than that, I wouldn't worry too much about doing things in any particular order. It definitely helps if you start working towards the elite specs because they open up more options for game play (and in some cases, are just flat out better *cough necromancer cough*). But realistically, take things any way you want, work towards mastery points, do the story, get maps done, whatever floats your boat right now 
---
Eh I'm sure there are many good points somewhere in that video but there is too much unfocused unnnecesary rant between all of them so I can't bare watching all of it.
---
You could go through almost any weapon just going through skills one by one shouting oh my god. Revenant mace axe, OH MYU GOOD THERE IS 2400 poison on AUTOATTACK, oh my goood there is 8000 FUCKING THOUSAND TORMENT DAMAGE ON 3 and it is fucking AOE 1.2k RANGE OH MY GOD. I can literally legend swap and do 5 condis on the target.
---
Is it possible to learn this power?

Ooh glad you like it too! Loving that this got more exposure, congrats!  https://twitter.com/GuildWars2/status/1085661185137991680

---
Yes; wherever you receive Marked from, 2s or more of stealth rips you out and reveals you. No, distance does not do it; the timer must run out on its own. Yes, the traps apply it too.
---
Yes, it makes Shadow Meld worthless.
---
Yes, it's absolute shit for scouting and makes that part of the game much much harder.
---
remove mesmer
---
Great work on these shots 
---
A song of ice and fire
---
Along with this, be a little strategic in unlocking your elite specs.  It takes a lot of HP to fully unlock them so choose which to start with carefully!
---
I'm playing mesmer for the first time, well the game actually XD I'm wondering what weapons and skills I should be leveling? I only have the base game currently.
---
That's how I rationalize it. I honestly dumped a bunch after playing the most recent LW episode because I was so blown away. I felt like I owed them something, and I love this game so I'm happy to contribute to it prospering.
---
it's shit now, it used to be good.
---
Ah, I guess.
---
For my Viper's, I just crafted the cheapest Ascended (usually Ferratus') and then stat change it in the Forge. Doesn't require the Jeweled Damask patches.
---
2 things
---
1) gear tiers haven't been changed since near the start of the game, and level cap has never been raised. Ascended has been the top gear tier almost since the beginning of the game. 
---
So, you might be wondering "what's the point if there's no new gear treadmill?". Well, the way that it works here is that your character has a variety of different stats, like power (pure burst dps), precision (crit chance), condition damage (DoT damage), etc, and each piece of gear has a specific combination of stats (power/precision/ferocity, power/vitality/toughness, etc.)
---
And so, as new patches come out, occasionally we get gear that has new stat combinations or builds that work better for certain stat combinations, so to keep up in this regard, you get new gear that matches the stat combination that you're looking for. So we have a kind of horizontal gear progression, rather than a vertical one.
---
2) there's two types of PvP. sPvP is mostly 5v5 arena type matches fighting over 3 control points, and in this mode, all gear is normalized to a single tier, and you just get to choose the stat combination that you want to use. WvW is large server vs server vs server matches, which uses your PvE gear. But as long as you're running the second best tier gear (exotic, can be bought on the player auction house), you can generally still match another player because there's only maybe a 5-6% difference in total stats between exotic and ascended.

Revenant. 
---
The weapon skills are all universally interesting, and each stance has a coherent, consistent style that tends to be easy to see and appreciate but not visually overwhelming like some mesmer or elementalist skills. 
---
In particular, sword 3, axe 5, hammer 3, and renegade f3 are all amazingly satisfying to use. 
---

Some solid points. 
---
My personal issue with condi mirage is the power dmg output on their weapons. It's like almost all their weapons are built to do both condis AND power dmg, based of their base damage and scaling. I tried to compare the weapons to necro weapons for the longest time to show the HUGE gap. 
---
One big point of mine was how torch was handled on both classes. Whilst they nerfed torch to the ground on scourge for the big amounts of burn and torment it applied, mesmers kept their (reworked) torch skills (got stronger after phantasm-rework) for an eternity. 
---
Whilst it was rightfully nerfed harshly on scourge for applying 3 burn stacks with torch4, mesmers easily applied 10+ burn stacks during their burst (torch4+torch5) for months (still do like 5+) whilst also gaining stealth for it and having the torch5 phantasm do half of the job. 
---
The feedback I gained for pointing that out was "you are retarded for comparing the same weapon on different classes"...
---
Skills: by the time you reach level 80, you'll have everything unlocked. It's impossible to not have enough skill points to unlock everything because they're given as level up rewards. So at this time, pick what you like and what seems fun to you.
---
Weapons: Greatsword is a good pick for leveling up. It's not the BEST damage weapon for mesmers in the long run, but it's ranged and does decent burst damage. For close up, dual wielding swords is also a pretty strong option. Honestly though, as with the skills, just try out everything and see what you like.
---
If you need some more ideas of how to build a mesmer in general though, I'd recommend checking out metabattle (although it might be hard because most builds will probably be set up around chronomancer or mirage, the elite specs)
---
If it's your first time levelling, just play around with stuff! Nothing is bad while you're levelling. One thing to note though, some weapons do more direct damage, others do more condition/damage over time. If you're using sword, focus, greatsword, or spear, run more gear with Power in it, if you're using scepter, staff, torch, pistol, or trident, go with gear with Condition Damage and Condition Duration.
---
As for skills, you get everything no matter what by 80, so just pick whatever looks fun, you can't mess up. If you feel like you're taking a lot of damage because mesmer is light armored, practice the evasions and blocks you have. Sword 2 lets you go invincible for like 5 seconds, sword 4 is a parry, staff 3 teleports you backwards, etc.
---
Will his voice be extremely bass boosted and speak weird Norse?
---
He had some valid points,  but others were lost in the rant for the sake of ranting.  I can't really speak on the state of mirage in PvP, other than I hate facing them in WvW,  but some of these points are just bloat and take away from the arguments.
---
* Jaunt doing several things - It's an elite skill...?
---
* Chaos storm and chaos armor - Honestly, I've never felt like these are ever the reason I lost to mirage.  Mirage doesn't have a lot of lockdown to keep someone engaged or immobilized in their chaos storm.
---
* Power damage on Sword - Well...yeah?
---
* Blink - It does one thing (like he asked)...is he actually mad about this?
---
* Pointing out some traits are powerful - Some of these are grandmaster traits.  They should be build defining.
---
Some valid points so it doesn't sound like I'm just disagreeing:
---
* Axe having decent power coefficients while being a condi oriented weapon
---
* Arcane thievery unblockable
---
If anything I think it's better to address the core issues at hand with the game and PvP in general.  The fact that kill times are pretty quick (though they made an effort to reduce this last patch),   some old weapons are just outdated and probably should be revisited,  and there's not always compelling trait choices to be made.  
---
So as you level feel free to try everything out and see what you like. As for actual suggestions Sword main hand is very strong, the #2 skill is great at avoiding damage and #3 allows for some mobility while making an instant clone. I'd suggest using an offhand sword as well though focus or pistol work as well (focus skill #4 is great for pulling enemies together). In open world you can also use a greatsword for some range and burst vs normal mobs. Metabattle also has some open world builds like [this one](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Mesmer_-_Greatsword_Burst) to give you an idea on what you might want to work towards but by the time you hit max level you'll have all skills and traits (base, not elite specs) unlocked just from leveling and the extra hero points are a bonus).
---
Might I recommend looking at /r/guildrecruitment? You might get some answers here, but I think you'll have much better luck finding more people in a guild who can take you in and show you the ropes. 
---
This basically sums up how most people feel about mesmers - except those that are willing to be ignorant about the class being a problem since day one: https://clips.twitch.tv/AliveGloriousOxOptimizePrime
---
Cool. Thanks. 
---
In the starting areas there are times when people will talk in the map chat offering to help new players 
---
I think you did not watch Brazil video or you lying to yourself, it is the same, Brazil did exactly the same(only difference was that he call them dishonest and that hurt them, Jaw don't do that but he offend dev in one moment too.), if you think that they don't get offended by this, you lying to yourself like I told you. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Don't get me wrong, I think this video is on point like Brazil one, but they can't handle such things 90% dev's at Anet are too soft and you can't do anything, they can't handle criticism.
---
Well I don't really feel the whole branded thing. I do however like to think that the ending scene was a fake, an Illusion made by Aurene.
---
The impossible thing Aurene was supposed to do could be winning the fight against Kralkatorik yet making it look like she lost.
---
Aurene soaked full of ED power is too strong ally to have. She must be written of at somepoint without her dying since she is the magic sponge to soak up all the magic. So that's why I have the following theory.
---
When kralky blasted us unconsiu, Aurene won the fight and soaked up kralkys magic, meaning Zhaitan (undead magic), mordremoth (mind magic) and Balthazar (mist walking magic?). These are shown to us on the fight btw as a reminder I'd like to say. Then Aurene re-animates Kralkys body with Zhaitan powers to fly away, "just leave" as npc puts it. She plants the illusion of losing and dying to our heads with mordremoth magic and then disappears into the mists with balthazar magic.
---
Next ep has been rumoured to take place in Kralkys spawn location so that's where the undead kralky flew with half his face missing and where we go in next ep to find out that kralky is undead. Commander then has a "wait a minute" sensation and rushes back to where Aurenes body should be to find nothing.
---
We are left with the relief that Aurene is alive but a sensation that we may never see her again still. This kind of an ending, imo serves as an optimal happy, yet believable ending without any deus ex machina gimmicks or lame joko dragons. 
---
Because he's reading everything like it's the most broken shit ever, i could explain every point he makes but i don't have time for that so i'm only going to show you why this rant is shit by the first exemple he gives in the video.
---
Sword auto attack :
---
The way he presents it make it look like it's the most broken spell in the entire game.
---
"omg it does more damage if the enemy has no buff" : there's not a single instance where someone has no boons.
---
"Omg third aa takes off one boon" you will almost never get to place the 3rd aa and one boon off is nothing nowadays.
---
And he goes on saying how sword 2 is broken while sword is probably the weakest main hand weapon at the moment. Another proof he has no clue how mesmer works is "sword 3 is like a shadowstep" the clone from sword 3 has like 2hp and will most likely die before you use it.
---
This is just a few exemple but basicly the whole video is him overreacting on every spell, and apparently it works since people buy into it but you could do that with everything in the game but that doesn't make it true.
---
Oh no.

This wasn't for reddit.

I just finished doing fashion wars for my Charr, even the cultural shoulders levitate.

That simply won't work without a *lot* of skin reworks...
---
For example [Illustrous Armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Illustrious_armor) on the wiki, try on their leggings: [&amp;Cm4AAAA=][&amp;CnAAAAA=][&amp;CmwAAAA=] and compare the spot where the leggings  end at the waist (Light v Medium v Heavy)...
---
If they become usable between armor types, there will be a bunch more clipping issues than there currently are; if you wear high-hipped leggings on a medium character it'll clip through *all* your trenchcoats... vice versa; if you wear medium leggings on a heavy or light character; you get a weird skin-seam; (which won't look like a crop top on most chest pieces)
---
BTW all experience scrolls that you get (along with tomes of knowledge) are account bound and can't be shared. If you friends have old characters they too will get the boosts (higher level scroll depending on number of years) otherwise they should have a level 80 boost from HoT to use once.
---
In general leveling isn't bad and can be done fairly quickly if you know what you're doing (it can help a lot to look at [experience boosters](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Experience) and be using at least cheap [food](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bowl_of_Candy_Corn_Custard) and [utility](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Apprentice_Tuning_Crystal) for the extra 25%). Should also be noted that you can level a crafting profession to 400 for a gain of about 7-8 levels, guides on that [here](http://gw2crafts.net/) cheapest option being cooking (cost is 2-4g which you can get with 1-2 dailies).
---
Lol its still worth the effort and noody knows it he's a Youtuber and is not to be trusted. Gota get content some how!!. He's is 100% right about dead eye tho that needs to be reworked asap.
---
I'm not arguing over the fact that mesmer is too strong, of course it is, my issue with your video is that  you're making up non existent problems wich if your videos gains enough attraction could lead to nerfs into the wrong direction.
---
In my opinion the damage is fine (maybe a tiny little too high), of course it does a lot but so does every class in the current meta, but people focus on that because it's condi and they have no idea how to counter confusion and torment.
---
The problem with mesmer is having (waayyy) too much way to avoid damage (portal nerf realy didn't help, please revert portal nerf :( ).
---
When u push \ you can see the chat box better, on the top you can adjust what you can read. I would suggest putting the map chat on since a lot of ppl talk in it about events or giving/asking for help 
---
Awesome thank you!!
---
is there a setting for glider or adjusting buttons? cuz i had issue that i always glide low and its very annoying in JPs like ember bay's one, where i cant advanced more cuz my gliding start low
---
Trust me when I say that ArenaNet very rarely listen to the public regarding anything. They do, and have always done, their own thing based on the statistics at their end. Even with players in Legendary / the top 1% feeding them information and recommendations, the outcome is based on their options and opinions alone, and rarely the involvement of those players. 
---
It's supposed to be hysterical and comedic. Enjoy it for what it is. You even state mesmer is too strong, so... That's what this video is about. :) 
---
Cantha's probably underwater by now tbh.
---
yea vulture stance isn't a huge deal for power soulbeast so they should always take frost spirit unless it's covered
---
honestly even as condi you should take it especially since power builds shine more in fractals
---
Sorry, not WP!
---
I appreciate you response, and I'll just leave it at, "I understand your perspective a bit better, but some points I will still disagree with" ;  since it sounds like you're not expecting to drag this out into a debate over reddit.  (Though daze being a random proc was news to me.  Thought it was only on cast!)

pls no slippery anywhere ever..i hated it in frosty's "raid" and it was a nightmare on f100(like 3 days in a row wtf)

the way largos works after you kill one of them kinda reminds of adrenaline rush
---
npng is a joke after the rework with 20s cd
---
i also don't get all this complaning about the birds, they are like the least harmful and least annoying instability
---
I love Chrono wells primarily for their sound, but for their clock ticking visuals as well.
---
" condi mirage is the power dmg output on their weapons " could you elaborate on that? Which weapons did you compare for example? Certain weapons like GS have stronger base value on both, Mesmer and necro, while other weapons are more based on condition. And pls don't come here and say "why is the damage so high with **carrion amulet** and on holo not that much higher with **demolisher.** Well guess what, demolisher has only 150 more power than carrion, thats why. Comparing stuff like that is useless if you don't reconsider other points like damage modifier. 
---
You have further differentiate how the skills work. torch 5 for example doesn't give a fuck on LOS and is ranged, while for prestige you need to be near your target exactly 3 seconds after being stealthed and is predictably that way. iMage has two casts, first the initial cast which proccs burning and then the second part when he casts his own attackl, he need to go near the target for that though. Especially on the old S/torch - staff build the burn was the burst that killed most people, so it needed definitly to be avoided. axe brought even more burst back tho.
---
I don't like the insanely high base burn duration either, but the theoretical damage isn't practical as it usually will be cleansed way before that. At least it should be. 
---
Doesn't seem like they want stealth as an aspect of the game right now anyway :/ guess i will just steer clear of wvw until some things change. I wonder how many other classes / players are displeased with some of the changes.
---
I mean, if you're going to take that statement literally...
---
It's your reposition on demand tool.  You use it - you go where you please.  No condis, no power component,  no cleanse.  It does exactly the 1 thing you expect it to.
---
This explains very well thanks, I currently have a level 80 weaver that I struggle a lot to stay alive and a 80 mirage that is a breeze but very bad for dungeons because everything dies so fast my condis do no damage. Spellbreaker looks fun, I'll give it a try. 
---
My friend has just started and doesn't have any tomes or writs. I wish I could share mine lol, even though I don't do a lot of WvW and PvP they still accumulate at a decent rate.
---
Mordremoths canon size is nearly as big as the tyrian continent considering in canon he stretched his body from dragons stand to iron marches to spawn mordrem in there. Doesnt mean they have to show it in game, could be cantha is on top of a relly large kraken/nautilus/dragon shell
---
Interesting perspective thank you!
---
Ah yes, that's what I meant! 
---
Haha
---
I recently uninstalled the wallpaper engine, but now i definitely have to install it again just for this, holy smokes
---
I get you video but, I pretty sure you know how they operate, and how childish they can be. 
---
Nevertheless I am very glad that you did that video, cuz PvP balance (all balance) around some Aids classes (let's face it mesmer is not only aids) is ridiculous.
---
Oi I can read tooltips with no context and make everything sound broken too and make dumb comparisons across classes. "Riptide is an almost 2 second evade, heals, and leaves a water field on a 10 second cd? Warrior can't do that! ANet this is BROKEN! DELETE ELE". Let's just ignore that a general philosophy with skill design is that things with lower base damage tend to have multiple other functions and Mesmer was a class designed with low base damage on just about all of its skills because their damage potential broken up between destroyable pets. Complaining about fucking sword? Really? 
---
A continuum split.
---
nice try anet

i won't need an outfit when i get that greatsword on my thief

I'm still waiting for all rev weapons to get the trident treatment.

Some people are less susceptible to horrors of mind-numbing, tedious, repetitive activity. After all, somebody still holds manual jobs on factories assembling lines or cleaning companies. That doesn't make going over the same content again and again less dull and boring, overall, it's just you who for some reason substitute a game with mindless clicking following the same pattern, again and again (which is something completely opposite to the game, by definition). So yes, it's not opinion, it's a fact - in situation when the same content have to be beaten many times, the only way to make it look a bit more like a game on 10th run is finely tuned randomization. No need to thank me for repeating it one more time, you're welcome.
---
PS warrior is still a thing isn't it?
---
Also Herald can radiate boons, which maybe sorta kinda I guess is similar.
---
Piece of advice from someone that took photography classes in college. Never. Center. The subject.
---
Play with the composition! Use the rule of thirds! Honestly your best composed shots are the ones where the character is offset. Which is a huge shame since a lot of the ones that are centered have amazing poses!
---
Play with the environment! Break the monotony and play with framing techniques.
---
N.A. I play at strange times anyway though. 11pm CST to 4am CST. 
---
It is decent but it definately isn't "very high in dps benchmarks".
---
I was an achievement hunter but I got burnt out. I felt rushed when new maps came out because that is the best time to do achievements that require groups. Plus, most are boring and not worth time investment.
---
I hope they improve this moving forward. 
---
High dps, no group support... sounds like DPS Weaver. 
---
Weaver is an elite specialization of the Elementalist, and the strongest DPS build for it at the moment uses a sword in the main hand, and an offhand dagger. You’re basically a sword-wielding elemental mage (Melee) but with very little group support. 
---
However, elementalist s are rather fragile, with the lowest base HP and Armor, so you will need to dodge properly and utilize your skills wisely. 
---
Not very beginner friendly but rewarding if you can play it well. Hope that helps!
---
Why is s/he a threat if nothing has happened?
---
I did that Forgotten event last night, but apparently since I wasn't directly on top of the Exalted guy when it started, I never got credit for being there to start it. I seriously don't expect to get that achievement.
---
Thanks! and yeah, i'm on NA
---
Roll 3d6, divide by two, round it up.

Don't think about it too much and jump straight to the part where you are having fun :P

Heh...
---
&gt; weird skin-seam
---
This already happens on some of the armor as it is. Can't remember the specific set but it's light armor I believe.
---
The stat sets. 
---
It's not at the top but it's a lot easier to execute in practice than some of the higher performing builds. I generally, not always though, see SB get better damage than people tryharding with weavers.
---
I'm genuinely sick of this shit tbh. 3 days in a row I've had to attempt to swap instances to get the room to myself to drop the plate only to have the purple plate drop. Anet needs to fix this shit
---
Those Asura built a prison for them in that place by the dungeon, and im sure largos said they were driven out by them, and the krait. Oh and the karka. 
---
Orca mount
---
Haha well that's fair too, but I wanna try to have fun with one character. I find my altoholism is starting to transfer into my single player games as well via restartitis, so I'm trying to get my focus back on track.
---
And sadly, all the classes look like a lot of fun!
---
Maybe still sleeping
---
Elite specialization? I didnt realize that was even a thing. I gotta look into those now too!
---
Thanks for the input, and I'm not overly concerned about player friendly items, mmo's aren't a new thing to me after all :)
---
That's interesting, thanks for the input!
---
As hard it is fight condi mirage the points the guy brings is far from solid and full of BS.
---
Let's talk about how he starts, he says he is on a condi amulet, but that's carrion amulet, so its 900 power 900 vit and 1200 condi + rune of adventure  which gives power and condi.
---
So "not exactly entirely condi build" as he claims where as wielding a sword which is a power weapon so obviously you have can show power damage there, why didn't he show the power damage shifting off to axe if it's so bloated? 
---
Next the ambush skill which dazes on sword doesn't exactly works the way he says it does where you can keep dating target with double dodge, it takes time to attack/leap and change from normal skill to ambush. 
---
Neither is chance to cause bleeding from pistol 100% unless you take duelling trait and leave phantsmal fury and desparate decoy most often used by mesmers because of glass cannon. Dude pretty much cherry picked stuff and did a great impression of rant.
---
And this is the first 4 mins he has talked about. I can go on and on about the rest of the video. As OP as mesmer is this I would rather blame it all on difficulty to target and target again than anything else. Do get the carrion mesmer in a team fight and see how fast it dies, has more or less condi clear at all and just glass cannon.
---
That's good to know, thanks! And I guess I should have clarified that I'm asking for PVE, PVP has never really interested me.
---
The Largos twins make sense from a watsonian perspective too. An entire race/culture dedicated to being ridiculously potent assassins? Perfect addition to whatshisname's murder menagerie. 
---
Which hardware part .. and gw2 isn't intense at all , play other stuff and you will see different temperatures , my gpu isn't even doing shit while gw2 runs , same for my CPU 
---
A lot of bosses will still take out a lot of your health/one-shot if you get hit even with decent gear, so i'd say it's pretty skill-based.
---
Oh yes, I definitely prefer doing acheevos and such for armor (not a fan of crafting personally), it just sucked that the Requiem gear was so cost heavy. 
---
That snowball fleeing for his life had me cracking up
---
Add me, Ace.4023 and let me know at what time and days do you fellas play?
---
Uh ... how much does 6 transmutation charges cost?
---
Play a couple. See what one you log into more. Play that one. If you can't decide do what I do and just rotate. Or pick a character and do the story, then the next character. If you get bored do something else. Eventually there'll be something you play more. I'd pick on asthetic from the start.
---
I wouldn't mind this at all - hell, just take my money.
---
Yep no rush. I'm on every day.
---
Obelisks, mirrors, two books. There’s an astronomy books and a history book inside the astralarium. Source: I made the staff, scepter and dagger. So far.

Just right now? Stealth hasn't been adequately 'fair' since launch, no matter how it's been balanced.

First; stealth. Then, revealed. Then, *removing* revealed. Now, preventing long-term stealth for groups.

ANet is telling people to use but not rely on it, especially for attacking objectives. That's all.

I like this idea a lot!

I hate the healing well. It sounds so dramatic and attention grabbing and it took me three years to figure out what was being so overdramatic all the time.

From what I got from it I think the plan was to kill him and have Aurene take his magic,
---
Not sure how that would have panned out but I think that is what they were aiming for.

That whole Jormag plotline was to prove our drift compatibility with Brahm.

We can autopickup mines while mounted but get unmounted when picking up spears...

In guild wars 2 legendary is a very expensive, mostly cosmetic tier of equipment. For most content besides fractals you should be fine with exotic gear, and early fractals don't require any ascended gear.
---
There is nothing that requires legendary gear to complete.
---
I'm actually pretty surprised you got 0 orbs, I get them pretty often. Keys I never get either though, wonder just how ridiculously low the drop rate is.
---
You really don't get it do you. The issue is not that on profession can do something others can not. The issue is that it is so overtuned compated to other professions that is not even on the same map. THAT is the issue. Not that i have waterfields and warriors do not. 
---
You did see that we are talking about PvP and WvW. So this is not a chrono pve rant :)
---
But it is so right on spot. I mean yes you rant but you also really show exactly what is wrong and why Mirage is so overtuned. And you don't say anything that i do not read in Guild, map, team and squad chat every day. 
---
Sorry though maybe i should have asked you first. 
---
You and I both know there isn't off season for wvw. Lol. Cuz wvw players only do wvw, almost exclusively, unless some seasonal events or something happens. Butt it's a rare case. 
---
I did take breaks and my breaks can last 3 PvP seasons long. Lol. But it's like my skills are off and rusty. And i wouldn't fit to compete in a competitive scene. Not just for competing, but the joy of a good game, of many great games. Same for wvw players, if you roam or in a havoc group, feel amazing when take out a bigger group or more skillful players. 
---
Yeah they only use season when it's on to test. Doesn't have to try. I just need practice time and o don't have rn. Lol. Been getting along with some esl player in another game and he's holding something for us here but really no time for practice. Gg
---
I kind of enjoyed that combo.
---
I tried the relogging trick to get into an empty room, then something worse happened :(

---
I don't think I've ever done a raid in GW2 that was more challenging than CM fractals.
---
It just feels like you can get carried so easily since it's 10-man instead of 5-man. You have less weight to carry in a raid squad than a fractal party.
---
Certain inscriptions/insignias cannot be crafted.  For example Dire, Shaman, Magi, and Rabid to name just a few.  These ones can only be obtained by salvaging exotic weapon/armor drops that have these stat types.
---
It's a bit convoluted, but just think about it as some stat sets cannot be crafted from Ancient Wood, Orichalcum Ore, Ectos, and fine mats, they can only be obtained via salvaging other drops.
---
Be certain about what you are wanting.  I want X and thus I need Y.  If the journey is irrelevant, just farm cash and go buy the thing.  Sometimes the journey is at least as important as arriving at the destination.
---
I remember the story of 'Click' where a bored and disgruntled guy got a magic universal remote that let him skip the boring and unpleasant parts of living.  He soon found himself to be old and unsatisfied, having missed out on everything that makes the journey  memorable and worth it.
---
Every day, there are questions about skipping leveling and going instant to lvl 80, then arriving without the rich experience of what it means to have gotted there.
---
Do as you will, but be certain that you only want a fish and don't care to learn how to fish.
---
Exotics do have a higher chance of dropping ectoplasm when salvaged, and of giving higher numbers of ectoplasms more often as well, though the range is still between 0-3 as with rares.
---
If you only just got to 80 you might even be fine with rare for now. While youre working on other things, try to level up your crafting and craft your own exotics instead of buying
---
These instabs wouldn't be a big deal if they weren't forced on us.
---
I wish Anet would at least give us increased rewards for those times when the instabs are crazy difficult. I don't mind a challenge, but it's no fun knowing that I'm going to be rewarded with the same items that I would get if the devs didn't hate us today. 
---
Unfortunately you can't. #baddesign
---
Comes with deluxe edition via in game mail.
---
That's not exactly a reference, we only call him Steve because ANet was already hinting his name started with S (somewhere in the Durmand Priory archives during season 2 I believe?)
---
So in other sense I can’t get it unless I buy the deluxe?
---
Unfortunately only through the upgrade.
---
T-posing on the silverwaste mobs? 
---
Can't give you too much info as I am a noob l, I am using 2h hammer for range and dual swords for sustain/burst. I'd have to log in to check my spec but I'm working on getting hero points to level Renegade.
---
Honestly can't find any in the [title list](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Title), not many mentions at all of anything even related.
---
Don't forget tax for the "permanence" of the outfit.
---
Probably yesterday at 15% off
---
HA HA! YOU'VE BEEN TRICKED! PRAISE JOKO!
---
Wait what.. I looked through the gem stall.. siding see it there
---
I literally spent 30minutes killing the veteran so when finally got the plate the Light skill was gone and couldnt reveal final chest, tried to buy another plate from TP but npc wont take it, so GG...
---
Beautiful!
---
I did watch it full,  as far as I remember you were talking about bleeding and torment damage on the axe.  I even remember your comparison with the holo 2 if I remember right? I didn't come here to throw share on your video BUT mentioned what I thought was cherry picked.  Like I get it you're ranting but you do you really think you can double daze someone with sword ambush by double dodge, it is great to distance cover as you mentioned just now that I will agree with. 
---
Next, yeah you showed that it will be better played with a staff, but you started off showing sword pistol,   the carrion ineptitude build that you posted has has disparate decoy in the build which is what I also mentioned and nothing else if you read what I wrote correctly. 
---
Instead of throwing insults about me and worrying about me just point what's wrong :)
---
I'm theorycrafting a raid build, what debuffs is it reasonable to assume my teammates are putting onto the boss without my help (including how many vuln stacks)?  Also, is 100% Fury uptime reasonable to assume?
---
The standing on mount thing, but not the bond of faith bug..
---
found the mirage :)  
---
fear not my mate, anet will carry your ass to eternity.  
---
Cherry picked? It is a slight variation of the meta build and basically the meta build for mirages.  
---
ok, you can argue you have slightly more power on this than on the used sage amulett. But the latter gives you fucking shit healing power making your totally fucked broken heal even more broken.. oh and you loose a little bit of flat power damage which doesnt really matter as your shit modifier is even more broken than my leg when a car crashed me.  
---
But fear not, you lost power? No matter maty, anet got your back covered by giving your totally fair condition damage even a little bit more damage.
---
3rd gen legendaries haven't been announced.
---
Yeah you're probably right tbh, its definately out of place for me to say that in even close to a manner so conclusively. Especially since I don't raid with him or even really care to. My only point of reference is comparable logs I've seen. So I concede, that your fair to say that, I can take that it on the chin. It's my mistake, mb dude.
---
So basically bandwagon theory #3.
---
  
---
For reference, how I'm numbering the most common theories I've seen about "Aurene's inevitable return" (pfft, as if it truly is):
---
1. Joko's magic makes Aurene immortal / self-resurrecting.
---
2. Aurene will pull a Mordremoth, transferring her mind, and will be born again out of her brand (either through Caithe or another means).
---
3. Aurene's spiritual state will be effectively the same as her living state due to Ascension and Balthazar magic.
---
4. Aurene, using Mordremoth's domain of mind, transferred her mind into Kralkatorrik's body.
---
5. Due to timey-wimey Mists stuff Kralkatorrik's been munching on, we're actually in some sort of time loop (how said time loop holds up differs from theory to theory) ever since that final blast.
---
Numbered by how often I see them. Honestly, I could probably put a 2,3,4 as blank based on how often the first one shows up in comparison, and another 2 or 3 blank slots between the third and fourth one.
---
It really gets fun in that regard when you want to gear a build that uses 2 different double weapon sets (e.g. core warrior on Axe/Axe + Mace/Mace) compared to say Condi Soulbeast on Sb/Sb or Staff on Ele...
---
I mean I don't think it's a crackpot theory so much as what's already in line with everyone else's theories. Rather, it's kinda a combination of them. I expect that since there's no way Aurene is permanently gone/dead, she'll have to undergo another physical change (and I don't mean a ghost/mists model) like at the end of PoF. You can't just spend roughly 3 1/2 years (from hatching to now) building this up only to immediately throw it out for something else. There has to be some payout for all that work, especially when the success of your plan relies heavily on this one thing that if it fails, there isn't a backup. We don't have the tech to revert Kralkatorrik to dormancy, since that machine was destroyed in LS3E5 in our fight with Balthazar, so that won't work. Also giving Caithe an entire transformation only to throw that out at the end of the same episode wouldn't make sense, and I don't see them doing that just to be there for the sake of exposition. Caithe deserves better. I think she'll still get to fulfill her new role as Aurene's medium, much like the Pale Tree has her own Avatar.
---
What happened to primordus? I know zhaitan it's killed in the story. Mordremoth in dragons stand. Kralk woke up after mordremoths death and is currently in the story. Steve or bubbles is at cantha. Jormag and primordus though?
---
The outfits shoulders are the worst. You see the most beautiful outfit in the gem store that is just ruined with the shoulder pads. Some of the outfits would be great if we could just hide those.
---
Isn't aurene a baby though? How can a baby absorb all that power.
---
We still haven't gotten all of the second gen legendaries, so third gen is quite a ways off.
---
When did the largos say this?
---
It’s not a precursor, feel free to stat swap it :)
---
This is what they were planning. This is why at the end of the episode the npcs say "We need her". If Aurene isn't alive Kralk cannot die and something else has to be done.
---
Which dungeon is this? I love this Lore.
---
Bro, I get it..I do realize mirage is OP. I have said that here myself. And I don't play condi myself, I have been playing power shatter even when it's far from optimal. Have been playing it in wvw and play it on pvp too. So as OP as condi mirage may be it doesn't really concern me much. 
---
Pls Anet just destroy LA. Make Kamadan Great Again
---
This is an amazing idea!
---
At first glance I though it was being lifted by two giant fingers. Beautiful art nonetheless!
---
I don't remember when those were introduced, but I have 3 accounts and I've only ever gotten 2 keys from them. 
---
If you have a druid, you should have 100% fury uptime. Assume max vuln (25 stacks) as well. 
---
The big eyes really make it.
---
You would dye all of your stuff prior to cloning it to become an outfit — you'd be combining 6 armor pieces all with different textures, color channels, and number of dye swatches so I doubt the standard outfit would look good.
---
You could redo the armor//dyes at any major hub by selecting a new armor set / using the same armor set with different dyes / making minor changes and whatnot. The intent would be to make it  a way to mask the gear you swapped over from another character to maintain the look you had on the current character.
---
Thank you
---
6 to put on Character B, 6 to put back on Character A, and +/- the tedium of redoing dyes or however many other characters you swap back and forth on.
---
&gt;It’s crazy that for this amount of time Anet manages to hide everything about this creature
---
Also known as not bothering to write anything about it
---
Depends really. GW2 can either require no grind, aka you gear full exotic and slowly work for ascended if you want. Or it could get really grindy if you want legendary, which include discovering literally everything in the base game (map completion), gathering tons of material, and crap load of gold. Legendary is only cosmetic though and doesn't give you any advantage aside from stat swap. Also, if you ever get bored take a break and wait until a new episode comes out. This has always been the best part of GW2 for me. The amount of free content you get free every once so often is amazing.  
---
*\*Megalovania theme plays\**
---
I don't agree, myself and many others often return to completed areas. Harvest-able resources scale so you can go pick flowers in your favorite area. I also often return to the same city to sell my loot and upgrade my horse, just because I enjoy the layout.
---
Then you've got the achievement hunters looking to get the fishing achievement. You might as well pick a nice looking area because it's going to take a while. Now fishing spots can run out too so you might prefer a certain zone over another **because you are familiar with it**. That almost never happens in MMOs.
---
Ok, how bad is the watermark? Will it show through while I'm playing?
---
The purple plate dropping from purple room simply means purple room isn't a part of the puzzle rotation.
---
I've yet to test if the puzzle rotation is map wide or instance specific though.
---
Best use of those is getting the HoT hero challenge that are not easily soloable honestly. 
---
Thank you for your help
---
It’s got its own ‘branded’ of humor 
---
IF and IF there is going to be Gen3 we wont hear nothing about it till AT LEAST mid this year... we're still waiting on the 2 (maybe 3) GS legendaries
---
The plate only drop for the last person enter the room. If there are multiple people inside the room, re-entering the room when the veteran drop below 25% always drop the plate for me.
---
Selbbub. Its known that its name starts with an s.
---
Tempest is pretty good for healing in WvW and fractals. You should keep your healing gear.
---
You're filled with... DETERMINATION!
---
[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Swoop\_(soulbeast)](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Swoop_(soulbeast))
---
Or maybe gw3 is where everyone is branded and we have to massacre everyone and everything that stands in our way of lord kralk.
---
There is no adding.  One handed weapon has one upgrade slot, while two handed has two. 
---
One handed - axe,scepter,dagger etc
---
Two handed - staff, greatsword, long,short bow etc
---
COE
---
Okay thank you! And any suggestions on sigil 
---
how is shadow meld worthless? I've played my deadeye in WvW recently, and I can still reliably kill people who don't know how to fight deadeyes. All you have to do is be patient and fight in areas that are outside enemy tower/sentry range and also not near a recently capped keep. The target painter trap location is obvious if you pay attention to your enemy's movements and the thrown target painter can be avoided as long as you're careful.
---
It has been probably been lost to time, but Anet actually did just this: state what role they wanted each profession to fit in. It was actually in the first year of the game if I recall correctly.
---
Mesmers were supposed to be the best duelist. For a pretty long time they were, great in 1v1 but pretty bad outside of that unless outnumbering because they had basically no cleave. They also lacked sustained presence for a long time since all their damage was loaded into combos.
---
There are one (or two?) in the canopy that you cannot see on the normal map that you need to follow the night meta to get to (or be really, really good at gliding and jumping). 
---
When was it ever said there would be more than 1?
---
Why go to the ocean when you got something called the deep dark place called space
---
Have you noticed any patterns? Are you in busy areas, WvW etc? 
---
The game engine is a bit old and creaky sometimes and is known to struggle in very high population areas. 
---
&gt; The feedback I gained for pointing that out was "you are retarded for comparing the same weapon on different classes"...
---
And it was a great feedback. You should have took it. 
---
These weapons and completely different things filling different roles, and even if there was a point in comparing them, (**there is not**), I would still say that current torch on scourge is more impactful.
---
My problem is they swing too far in the opposite from GW2's writing. GW2's commander is kind of a blank slate, and I get trying to flesh the Commander out, but the writing in those comics swings  way back over to overly melodramatic and weepy, at least IMO. 
---
Primordus and Jormag are back to “pre-awakening” stages, after Balthazar us Omadd’s machine last season to make them go ten rounds with each other. Also, Kralk has been awake since 1320, before Mordremoth.  
---
Winter presence drinks cost like 100g.
---
All good. Super excited!

Completely depends on the team comp. If you have even a couple Power Holosmiths, Dragonhunters, Renegades, or Soulbeasts your vulnerability will naturally cap out but in situations where you're running mostly mirage with a solo druid they'll need to take storm spirit (the spirit alone keeps cap). Other conditions depend on the fight as well but it's common to have  but it's not uncommon to have most up: 
---
* Bleeding (Many including Ranger, Scourge, Engie, Firebarnd, etc)
---
* Burning (Guardian, Berserker, Soulbeast (dager/torch), Ele, Mirage, Renegade, Holosmith, and Scourge)
---
* Confusion (mainly Mirage, some Renegade)
---
* Poison (Soulbeast mainly)
---
* Torment (Mirage, Scourge, Renegade)
---
* Chilled (Druid and Chrono)
---
* Crippled (Tons of sources but many from Ranger and Dragonhunter)
---
* Blind (Berseker and Mirage)
---
* Vulnerability (Warrior (more so base), Druid + power SB, Chrono, and large amounts from Dragonhunter and Holo)
---
* Weakness (Druid and Daredevil)
---
There are more sources and details but that's what I came up with off the top of my head.
---
Was browsing through my achievements on gw2eff, to find out i've apparently placed top 3 in way more races than i've ever run. Is there an actual reason for this? 
---
The condis depends a lot on the team composition, however for classes that usually rely on the number of condis SC says that you can expect 10 condis on the boss. Some of them will be very easy to get (bleed, burn, vulnerability) but for others you may need to check what class you have (for example you may not have poison on a boss where you only have power classes and no Dagger Deadeye).
---
Me: Nice!!
---
Wife: Hell NO!
---
nani?
---
Happend to me as well today. 
---
So...waiting on the 1, maybe 2, and you're dreaming about 3.
---
How to complete or how did you get that far?
---
Sanctum sprint comes up in the rotation for activities I believe 2 times a week.  It also appears in the now yearly Labryth Festival.  The activity NPC appears in all Lounges as well as in Lions Arch and during the festival he's near the top waypoint, check the regular NPC daily to see if Sanctum Sprint is the activity or wiki the rotation and wait for the days.  Just be aware, if it's a daily, getting 1st might be an issue.
---
As far as how you could've gotten that far, all activities used to be available everyday  and this one was particularly popular during S2.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sanctum_Sprint_(achievements)
---
&gt; Speedy Sprinter
---
First place = 3 points
---
Second place = 2 points
---
Third place = 1 point
---
Druid and Chrono (there is a current beginner friendly Chrono rotation) are both not hard in that regard, extra difficulty comes in when you also need to perform a boss/fight mechanic such as tanking, kiting, extra cc/mob control and positioning.
---
For a new player - gearing would be the most hard part tbh. Everything else will come with exp, and you can always avoid more difficult role (tank/kite) by doing your raids with training guilds.
---
If you like thief, practice thief, finness your build so you get damage and survivability you're comforfartable with and take suggestions from other players or play the meta.  Just don't go in fresh out of the gate thinking you're going to win a fight just because other thieves do and don't listen to YB videos or forum posts, they're a conspiracy to get you to switch classes because people don't like yours.
---
Practice, learn to pick your targets, pay attention to revealed, learn the signs of and size of map activity and movement, scope out other players buffs, boons and food, learn which professions and / or ranks you have better luck against and give it time.  No one walks into any part of the game a master of their profession and even masters lose, so don't give up.
---
I really hate that dude's videos, he can be really retarded sometime(most of the time).....
---
Relevance?
---
All the memes from the recent episode, its just so predictable, I can't believe you guys have the autrocity to even begin with, it was a serious aswel, just look at them, they come to this place when they know they are not pure. Tenno use the keys, but they are mere trespassers. Only I, Vor, know the true power of the Void. I was cut in half, destroyed, but through its Janus Key, the Void called to me. It brought me here and here I was reborn. We cannot blame these creatures, they are being led by a false prophet, an impostor who knows not the secrets of the Void. Behold the Tenno, come to scavenge and desecrate this sacred realm. My brothers, did I not tell of this day? Did I not prophesize this moment? Now, I will stop them. Now I am changed, reborn through the energy of the Janus Key. Forever bound to the Void. Let it be known, if the Tenno want true salvation, they will lay down their arms, and wait for the baptism of my Janus key. It is time. I will teach these trespassers the redemptive power of my Janus key. They will learn its simple truth. The Tenno are lost, and they will resist. But I, Vor, will cleanse this place of their impurity. 
---
Sounds like Selbbub.
---
And they share basically the same skin.
---
Cheers man 
---
that depends on your definition of worth the money and your daily usage of it.
---
Another theory that a friend of mine submitted to me :
---
\- We need something to replace the eleder dragons that would take and transmit the energy.
---
Do we really need Aurene alive to do that ?
---
What if Taimi created a machine able to do that from the body of Aurene ? Some sort of crystal ? No more dragons needed to keep the world safe.
---
For starters, what about collections for all full armor sets, where if you complete the set, it unlocks whole outfits of the sets for you to toggle on and off whenever. This would make getting whole sets more rewarding.
---
I love it but I feel the raven should have a slight idle animation.
---
Is sword dagger good for leveling too? 
---
Open your own squad.
---
Shadowstep does the same but then you can also return teleport that also stun breaks and remove condis
---
Already got the map achievements. Working on the rated game wins for all classes at the moment, that's why i spam ranked games
---
that's some serious stretching you're doing there
---
There was a short amount of time when you got those keys instead if you got something accountbound you've allready unlocked. There I got many
---
Space dragon !
---
There are no 3rd gen released yet. 2nd gen still misses greatsword.
---
How much time did it take?
---
It's kind of weird... didn't the gods come from the mists? Doesn't that mean that the mists should be full of powerful entities just like the gods? Does that mean kralk is currently not only tge most powerful being in Tyria, but also the most powerful being in the universe?
---
In term, does that mean he will destroy the entire universe? On macroscale, why, from all the potential worlds, does only tyria have elder dragons? What even are elder dragons? Where did they even come from? And what even are the mists? Afterlife? Space?
---
mounting onto griffon midair was always a thing since they introduced mounts...dismount was not. pretty good choice to put the ability in as a skill with a cd so you can't spam it.  
---
the users whished for it and so anet took the best out of two worlds.
---
4000 gems, shut up and take my money
---
I cant find you on the Workshop, when using WE ;/
---
Because underwater combat sucks.
---
They could name a jormag primordus expansion something like that. In hindsight, my comment made no sense, i needed sleep 
---
Thanks for that OP, so turns out my 2hrs sat at Pepperseed spawn last night were for nothing.
---
Any idea on when the Defend Zephyrites from Branded event pops? 
---
hmmm exactly 6 transmutation changes... and given the fact they come for free from so much sourses.. i guess exactly 0 gems.
---
Would you mind linking the beginner friendly Chrono? It'll be very helpful to me! 
---
It‘s time for some truth nuggets. Everything I say here is in the context of wvw roaming. Apart from some slight overtuning on deadeye, thief is actually really well balanced. If it‘s too strong, everybody facing thief would be miserable. You can actually 1v1 every single spec except for non longbow Boonbeast and Druid. 
---
The problem you are facing here is that you are comparing yourself to people who have been playing thief for 5+ years. No other way around it but to practice until you „get gud“ 
---
Thief can be very unforgiving but as you get better you will get so much more satisfaction out of outplaying others. 
---
The issue is picking the class :D  
---
I only made few characters on WoW before finding the one I enjoyed, but after going to GW2, I rerolled 50 times at least.
---
The Lily of the Elon you get from PoF deluxe is quite handy if you got alot of alts you want to bring over to Elona without playing the story everytime
---
Is among the best damage dealer, why change it ? :D  
---
I just want deadeye to feel more snipery.  
---
Yeah I still have a bit of gems left, but currently not enough nor enough to convert to gems to upgrade to the deluxes. I definitely am a collector/achievement hunter type, so I don’t want to miss out on anything either. I also wouldn’t mind having the gems because I could save them to grab the next xpac. 
---
&gt; I just hope Aurene doesn't come back next episode but the one after.
---
I'd honestly like to see us take down Kralk without her help. He's been a menace to the people of Tyria for so long and I'd like to see everyone band together and take him down for good.
---
Aurene can show up at the end to play the role of the dragon-magic sponge and prevent the end of the world that way, just let us have an appropriately epic final battle first.
---

You cant do any of that if your magic (soul) is consumed. There's no more Zhitan since the other dragons are absorbing his magic, there's no more mordry since again, the dragons are absorbing its magic, there's no more balthy since aurene and kralk absorbed his magic, ect.
---
In other words, unless a dragon eats you, death is not final. It makes sense to me, and remember that until kralk started eating the barrier, the mists  and Tyria were very separate. 
---
I mean HoT came out 4 years ago you don't need spoiler tag.

I need a bit of help understanding Grandmaster shards and Marks. I've just started getting into WvW and it's awesome, so I figured I'd start up the Triumphant Armour reward track and get some ascended armour. 
---
Now I've already got 1 or 2 Grandmaster shards...and I gather that 10 of these = 1 Grandmaster Mark which I can use to buy ascended armour from the skirmish vendor...but my question is how do I specifically get a Tailor Grandmaster Mark for light armour? The wiki says I need to have the relevant discipline leveled to 500? What's the point of that as if I had tailoring at 500 I'd just craft it myself. 
---
I think I'm missing something...any help?
---
This is one hell of a quality rant, kudos
---
Quick detail: I'd argue that sword and focus are decent condi weapons for Guardian. Not because of the (inexistant base burn application)  but for the ability to hit in very quick succession thus procing the Virtue of Justice burn often (if you have the trait that burn every 3 hits) with focus 4 (fire and forget multi hit) sword 2 (gap closer and pulse by symbol) and sword 3 (multi hit) along with the sword auto attack which is rather quick at trigger Justice.
---
Other than that yeah I'd agree with the way guardian weapons feel clear cut between power and condi (I wish there was a bit more options for condi guard actually, so many weapons I can use, but most are power) 
---
wasted ocasion for hopping into infinity
---
Deadeye rifle and Reaper greatsword have really cool sounding abilities. Reaper greatsword has some really cool ability looks as well. My go-to classes though for just feeling good and looking cool are my Spellbreaker and my Dragonhunter.

I mean, some people still have not played it so it does need the spoiler tag. I was just spoiled the ending of LWS3, and I'm moving on to the last chapter now. 
---
It is ALWAYS right to put a spoiler tag.
---
What? Even Ogden said, in one of the LW chapters that "many scholars would give much to know the name of this dragon" or something to this effect (I think this was season 2, episode 5).

let's start discussion from here - if there is anything to discuss
---
Thanks for putting them on SoundCloud. I know you kind of declined before but I still would like to mention how awesome it would be to get them on Spotify, too. Maybe not when they are released but when a whole season is finished, release an album of all S2, S3 and soon S4 tracks there. Like the Album's for HoT or PoF. I personally hear the Game's soundtrack a lot but having to switch between SoundCloud and Spotify is a little bit annoying plus I would like the thought of giving a few Spotify cents to the composers. 
---
Even if it's not possible still a big thank you for the amazing music we've got. My favourite piece from the recent episode is probably "The Hope of Tyria". The ending reminds me a little bit of the HoT-Theme, (which is my favourite HoT Track) with this heroic buildup at the end. 
---
in the Discipline build (Banner or DPS) you avec a Sigil of Doom which applies 3 stack of poison for 8 seconds (base) and you swap weapons almost on CD in you rotation so you can perma or almost perma poison on a boss only with that.
---
It's because I currently have power build (and am broke) and don't really have the means yet to invest in a condi build.   
---
But wanted to be sure before I invest any further to complete the power build, or stop there and focus on condi.  
---
Looks like i'll stick to power for now and complete that build first with accessories and perhaps axes
---
Maybe , when the time comes, aurine will grow up, need no champion, and fly away from her safe cozy dragons watch nest and go on a brand new adventure of dealing with bubbleS in the background and all we get are 1 "energy readings" from taimy once per real life year
---
Ascended is relatively grindy but luckily exotics are good enough for most the game
---
So? There is no difference - yes, he is using his own materials but rights to design are owned by ArenaNet.
---
The spirits power Soulbeast could bring are mainly Frost, Storm or Sun - as Stone Spirit is not fully effective without traits. Usually Frost is covered by the Druid, and Sun and Storm may not be needed if the party can put 25 Vulnerability and there are only few number of condi dps. In that case it might be better to go with the default dps option.
---
&gt; mounting onto griffon midair was always a thing since they introduced mounts
---
So was opening your glider. Which is why they specifically prevented *dis*mounting instead which had the same overall effect of not being able to glide from the apex of a springer jump. And yes you can swap to griffon but that doesn't help unless you're legitimately intending to fly/glide, just as with many bundles and combat skills we cannot swap between horizontally mobile mounts until we're back on solid ground after dismounting. In particular this makes swapping between the springer and raptor/jackal a clunky mess further compounded by an ICD when you *do* hit the hotkey while still airborne. 
---
&gt; pretty good choice to put the ability in as a skill with a cd so you can't spam it. 
---
This fixes none of the potential abuses except for infinite height gain on the griffon. 
---
&gt; the users whished for it and so anet took the best out of two worlds. 
---
You can still jump into mount exclusion zones using the skill, you can still make previously impossible jumps in HoT movement challenges and I am still forced into an annoying 1-2s cd every time a cliff or a random hillside is too high for my raptor/jackal to traverse. Or spend more like 5s edging around on a cliff face until my feet are floating off the actual rendered terrain because I can't just switch mounts while still seated on the springer. The technology even *already exists* in the ranch mounts so this clearly was a deliberate design choice at some point.
---
&gt; also i don't really get your point, having the griffon or all the mounts already broke all wayfinding content from the start. doesn't matter if you are able to dismount or not.
---
There definitely were a few places where you could abuse the exact dimensions of the exclusion zone, or exploit a mismatch between the gliding- and mount-specific zones to make the jump. With the new mastery you can just cast it from the springer wherever you please and the only solution is a broad-scale blanket ban. These then make regular non-abusive open world gameplay an inconsistent mess as you can already "enjoy" at Arca WP in NW Harathi Hinterlands: just port there looking for the guild bounty, you can't mount up. The exclusion zone follows part of the road and extends all the way along the hillside.
---
Plus it adds a further split to *future* content as well: you will notice they have added griffon adventures to LS4 releases but no actual beetle courses and no smashable walls. Going forwards we not only have "griffon vs. no griffon" exploration but those who have the mastery can *further* cheese things which were explicitly designed to stump the griffon itself, much like the Vigor mastery broke elevation-based gates on the chests in the new map.
---
&gt;We also haven't had a major character death since Eir.
---
Didn't Brazil basically accuse them of scamming people and also specifically called out\made fun of the devs who worked on the armor? His rant was on another level where it descended into an attack on Anet.
---
Jaw's rant here is consistent with the stuff he always says on stream including the manner of it from what I remember, and there are frequently Anet devs there like Ben. 
---
not to be viable. but if you want to look good then be prepared to grind more than most MMO's out there. Either that, or learn how to play the market or spend real money on gems, or a combination on both.
---
I was planning to replace my copper salvage o matic but I am not sure if i should replace it. 
---
My usage will be like all white, green, blue items i received will be salvaged by runemaster salvage kit if i were to buy it.  
---
Would like your opinion if i should buy a runemaster salvage kit. 
---
Thanks.
---
Well i wanted to, but for some reason my character mounted the springer
---
If anet managed to hide anything related to steve it's because he doesnt exist yet
---
Its hinted the gods themselves may not come from the mists, or that they did bht their power isnt inherently their own. In path of fire ita said the forgotten had something to do with the human gods having power or gaining power. It is said they dont want rhe balance being upended by a dragon consuming a human god because of what kralk is currently doing
---
That being said i know its said their are other worlds in the mists but so far ita all different tyrias, so maybe they do (in cases of non tyrian worlds) have their own kind of elder dragons, but theyre different in how they preform magic regulation. This is kinda a gray area as much really isn't known 
---
Oof. Well I hope the info helps. Don't know about the defend event, but I see it pop often enough.
---
Are you legitimately advocating for i-frame rolls? If you think that has any skill or depth than we have nothing to discuss. As for combat in general, objectively false. It's literal cooldown rotation with no resources to track and it simple enough that people can do it with less than 10 players AND clear all the encounters in a day. 
---
Let's just put it this way, a WoW mythic raider can easily pick up GW2 mechanics and 1shot a raid. A GW2 player can't do the same thing in WoW because he's never seen or experienced no i-frames or more than 2-3 mechanics in a single fight. 
---
Sorry mate but GW2 raiding is way easier than WoW raiding, speaking from experience. Simple as
---
Lets look at this from self preservation aspect:
---
Steve: Oh shit! He/she killed 2 of my bros, lets try different approach to this !
---
That could work i guess. Also where did you get that ED have no free will? 
---
Thank you very much for the detailed response and the video for Season 1! I guess I will play the original until I finish it and after that worry about the expansions, to enjoy them in the correct order.
---
Aurene wouldn't be really different from the griffon. That's why I'm kind of sad since I have the griffon. 
---
Chance to use Aurene as a mount missed.
---
I really dont want Taimi to leave, i find she is the best voiced character. i was just hoping gorrik would be around to be a second to her since she has been doing everything pretty much alone and having some assistants would make a bit more sense.
---
&gt;Monstrosity whose minions have never been seen by us 
---
Remember the bubbing water spouts the commander fight during the test in Tarir?
---
Maybe the supplies need to be full to "trigger interest".
---
The annoying thing with that heart though is it's so much quick to just kill the arguing pact members and corsairs that no one ever does the supply part. 
---
The photos are amateur, the prices are not!
---
When recipes say they require multiple different crafting professions, do you need all of them, or just one of them? For example Viper's Intricate Gossamer Insignia says it needs Armorsmith (400), Leatherworker (400), Tailor (400) - I assume that means I just need 400 in 1 (because why would you learn those 3 on one single character, makes no sense at all)?
---
Thanks for the info.   
---
As i'm as good as broke, I'll stick to power for now as it does indeed seem to be a viable option after all.  
---
going to look into axe offhand though, and perhaps add a sword to that as main during fractals.  
---
LB is fun but seems a bit lazy from time to time. Good enough in openworld tho.  
---
Currently only done T1 fracts since I just reached lvl 80 very recently so the higher lvl/more difficult Fractals are yet to come, with raids probably not in the very near future. 
---
And this is why Blish is gone forever.

Would you say that Mordremoth is a potato made of wood, though? A wooden potato per chance? 
---
WP == Mordremoth confirmed?

Thank you! o/

Thanks so much! :D
---
After 2,000 games on thief, and 30 games on condi mirage, I beat my highest peak rating that I got with thief on condi mirage.
---
So I can conclusively say that the only thing a thief player can do better than a condi mirage is play condi mirage.
---
Seriously, if you play thief I highly recommend you switch over until ANet nerfs this thing. If you ever feel frustrated by the limitations of your abilities on thief, and the fact that you have to make painful choices on your build, just run condi mirage. It’s like goin from a beaten down bug to a fucking Porsche
---
Why wouldn't you habe expansions? You know that since many years the only way to buy GW2 is by buying at least one of the expansions, right?
---
The standard collection (full base game + both expansions) was available for 25 bucks until monday...the price was reduced like it is **every time** a new episode of the living story comes out.
---
And also, I suppose you should either work on the quality or on the pricing. You want way too much gold in exchange for photos which mostly don't even follow the basic rules of photography (lighting, positioning).
---
white and blue items dont have any upgrade components slotted so it doesnt make sense to us the runemaster kit and pay the extra salvage costs, just use it for greens.
---
Jfyi, it seems that gold to gem has some kind of base cost which means 2x2g to gems &lt; 4g to gems. The lower the gold amount you're converting is, the bigger impact it has.
---
I really hope she goes Blish's way.
---
When should i run fgs or elementals minions? Glad to see you came back 😎
---
Think going from the initiative system to the cooldown system is hard? not when a single condi mirage abilities can do what 2-3 of your abilities normally do. Miss steal? Just drop your shatters, don’t even need clones and you’ll do enough damage with insta-cast abilities to down a full health.
---
While I was testing this, it never went above 50mb. Tho I imagine 4k would require more.
---
We finally get to Cantha only to discover the entire land has already fallen.
---
IIRC the activities are on a rotation. Only one activity possible per day. So better check the NPC daily to see which activity is up for the day.
---
On a Holocharr whatever you hit is going to hurt. The animation has the feel of impact behind it.
---
&gt; for this amount of time Anet manages to hide everything about this creature
---
Technical difficulties.
---
Sadly, I don't know how to do full idle animation from the game, but rn raven is moving, only slightly, but oh well.. :D
---
I wish we'd get a few Branded Masses for succesfully completing this event.
---
Suppose, but I'm just not sure what mirage brings that base mesmer couldn't do better
---
It's not about mesmer or necro in themselves. It's about new skills, weapons and updates requiring more power to make them "feel" better than before. Balance isnt a design consideration. Every skill or weapon update has been a buff. 
---
Compare necros sceptre 3 to axe 3 when both are traited. Scepter 3 does everything better. More power damage, more range, lower CD, more corrupts, improved life force and good baseline condies. 
---
Look at guard staff update. In between nerfing fb's healing and defence patch after patch, just carelessly adding tons of healing and utility to staff on its rework. 
---
Or offhand rev sword update. Hey anet here. We noticed nobody was using offhand sword over shield, so we reworked sword and made it so absurd nobody will use shield again. Then ignore the issue for a year or two. Once it's no longer new we can attempt to balance it.
---
How do we make weapon skills more fun for players? Creative design? Nah. Just make them do everything better than both predecessors and alternatives. That'll give players a sense of pride and accomplishment, no doubt. 
---
The deluxe editions are not worth it. The only thing that matters in either of those is the lily of elon passkey, and while it looks pretty, mistlock sanctuary is just better, so you’d be better off just buying the bundle and a mistlock sanctuary pass mext time it comes on sale
---
Well, big things need a big grind.
---
BUT
---
1. most big things are just extra. Not really needes. 
---
2. you can replace a whole lot of time with money. 
---
???? Mirage is now an easy support spec boys. 
---
The only thing I doubt will happen from this theory is aurene becoming even more powerful. I think it'd be a huge issue for future storytelling and immersion if we had something that's above a God power level on our side. I imagine that aurene reviving in the mists will actually strip some of her power from her, making her more of an passive figure than an active combatant in the world, similar to how glint is. Or she'll be able to manifest only rarely... Basically I'm counting on some big drawback to this ascension rather than an upgrade. 
---
***My personal opinion:***
---
As a mesmer main(er) and a big fan of the class - the biggest issue with the mesmer is that people on the balancing team seem to have no idea what it should do, so they shovel everything into the class. This is why both chrono and mirage will never be really balanced. Also, public outcry "nerf chrono" made them ignore problems with mirage. After all, most vocal complaints were about chrono, not mirage, right?
---
Honestly I feel like they are running in circles. Mirage is actually what I ever wanted from duelist mesmer, it has all the tools I wanted from mesmer, that is supposed to be perfect for 1vs1 combat. But it has the double amount of what I wanted. They should have replaced shatters with some new skills if they were going to give mesmer attack and dodge in one. Also - mirage is able to output way too much conditions, most of them even don't fit the theme of spec! Theme of mirage should be blind, confusion and weakness, duelist of smoke and mirrors. Not applying tons of burn, bleed, torment... those sound more like berserker or necromancer things.
---
On the other hand we have chrono. I think rework of SoI was unnecessary. The only thing they really needed to do was to make mesmer unable to generate all boons by himself. They only needed to gut things like bountiful disillusionment (like why the hell does mesmer generate for example might, is he a warrior or something?) and reduce generation of quickness on chrono (quickness **on each shatter** who even though it would be a good idea?).
---
You seem lost, my friend. 
---
Not that i don't agree with this nice, but angry gentleman, that Mirrage (especially in PvP) is broken.  
---
It's that comparing **condition aplication** of a **condi** based and specced Mirrage to a **power** Holo build is just plain wrong.  
---
Jumping above fact that immob skill on sword 3 deals flat '2' power damage and engineer's immobing 'Net shot' deals over 400.  
---
Comparing uncomparable skills to eachother.  
---
Skipping **condi** engineer weapon skills from pistol that will apply nearly 20k burning damage with one shot. Or granade kit attacks that apply 4 conditions with every attack. Oh and boons.   
---
Countless blast and leap finishers.  
---
What about comparing Mirrage to Scrapper?  
---
What i would really like to see is comparing condi builds on certain classes to condi builds of other classes. Not putting things out of proportions.  
---
Nice video though - before the Holo comparison - highlights the right amount of 'interesting and hilarious design flaws' of Mirrage in PVP.
---
What's a good source for PvE builds currently (beginner friendly preferred)?

bait this obvious

Hi, first of all, welcome to Reddit and congratulations on your first post! 
---
Would you please elaborate your arguments so there could even be any meaningful discussion on the matter?
---
It's not worse, just different. I like raid on wow and not on GW2. But the story, event and pexing is more better on GW2. Dungeon/Fractal are specials with no heal/Tank class, but easier to make with friends
---
Nice shitpost buddy, I’ve been playing from WotLK and WoW feels like shit, GW2 still holds onto the MMORPG roots and feels refreshing in comparison to what WoW became, WoW died after Cataclysm and only thing to bring it up might be Classic, we’ll see tho...
---
GW2 is amazing and it’s better than WoW in it’s current state!
---
ever heard of bait before?
---
r/warframe leaks once again
---
Maybe we have seen his minions, oozes are certainly thematic.
---
&gt;There is literally no reason for doing that without Aurene.
---
No reason? I mean... she's dead. That alone is a pretty good reason. Given the current state of the story I don't think *'ok guys, bit of a setback but nothing to worry about, take five and wait for our dragon to come back to life'* is going to cut it.
---
&gt;And also, an "epic" battle with thousands of people against one dragon is absolutely not the style of this game and it would also make the gameplay uniffting.
---
Sure it would work. We can field airships, golems, artillery - the lot. I'm sure that a battle of scale befitting Kralk is within Anet's ability. I'm not actually suggesting hundreds of ground units.
---
&gt;And btw. Aurene has a specific role storywise and that's another reason why it would be wrong to proceed the way you suggested for now anyway.
---
She certainly does.
---
And we have no idea what that is, beyond absorbing dragon magic.
---
They might not have known about the bug
---
mirage (and most elite specs, to a lesser extent) are overloaded and overtuned???? 
---
*suprised pikachu face*

Then I guess every single thread and comment needs a spoiler tag from now on just because you asked.
---
woooooosh
---
Instead of upgrading or in the intermediate waiting for gemstore passes, there is a slight work around.  Port to the previous LS (Jahai Bluffs) with the portal scroll and enter Domain of Vabbi the work your way up to Crystal Oasis.  Saves on WP fees, but does involve travel, and gems if you don't have Jahai.
---
Yes, I'm currently using Exotic armour that wasn't too expensive (seemed to have the same stats as similar, but named and a lot more expensive armour).   
---
Afraid I currently do not have the funds for an axe and second main weapon, but will work towards it. Shouldn't take too long I suppose.   
---
Ascended will be a long way off though, I'm quite a casual player :) 
---
Had this happen to me yesterday, seems to just be random after dismounting. I had some lag before but it persisted after my ping was normal again. I got to the skybox in thunderhead keep, the glide down was very nice :p
---
&gt;''I prefer to tank and support in games and am looking for a class that allows me to fulfill either role.''
---
he's not looking for a soley support role class, he also wants to be able to tank and he wants a low skill floor. Mirage fits this, since it can still support decently compared to other choices for tankiness, and mirage has a very easy mindless rotation.
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
It just brings in the tankiness. It's an easy rotation with decent damage and you can allocate boons such as quickness through skills to support.
---
now i'm sold on killing her off
---
Yeah but maybe he's like a dog. Extremely food oriented, but a good boy.
---
You need as other people already said the deluxe edition. Lucky for you, you can get the Lava lounge which is the best Qol area ^^
---
I'll probably get downvoted into oblivion for this but I have to say:
---
All this guy does is hyping regular skill descriptions (of which half of them he doesn't seem to understand himself like the pistol skills for instance) and acting like they are extraordinary as in calling even low numbers out as if they would be instanely high. Yes, the skill description scales with power - and for his argument he's ignoring precision and ferocity.
---
All in all I can't take that guy seriously at all.
---
Skill calculators as in ... skill? or do you mean build?
---
Those achievements also count unranked games.
---
Only hot join games dont count towards the achievements.
---
And I want a pony. We don't always get what we want.
---
I played WoW like a decade ago for a year. It wasn't very good and killed MMOs for a good while for me. Kinda wish the PvE and PvP elements in GW2 were overlapping at least somewhere but beyond that GW2 beats blizzshit in every imaginable way.
---
I believe it's not to do with the player who interacts to spawn it, it drops for the player *who last entered the tomb* and forms a queue based on that. So if you're in there and killing and someone else walks in, watch, if they tagged the graveling they'll probably run right out with the plate.
---
Also, if someone has the plate *it keeps on dropping for them* unless they leave the tomb. So staying and helping is very much **not helping**.
---
Don't feed the troll.
---
Are you disclosing someone else's name under this shit post in hope someone will bother to whisper them in game?

Gotta put my vote in for revenant.
---
Their visuals look the most refined of any class. Probably because the class came later with the hot expansion. 
---
Ele will have a lot of flashiness but the effects themselves look dated. Like meteor shower just looks like you're dropping oranges on enemies lol. Hell even gw1 had a better meteor shower animation.
---
Mesmer probably gets my second vote cause the graphical style has held up well.
---
What a weird thing to ask on the gw2 subreddit.
---
i'm in awe! its a pure joy to look at :)

Compare that to Berserker, where only 2 skills on longbow apply any condition at all, and only a single (1) underwater weapon skill applies a condition.

Most people say Druid is a very easy support class to play but I don't think that's true. Druids have a bad rep because a lot of new players think you can just get away with camping staff, clicking a couple glyphs here and there and sometimes going into avatar to give might, but the class actually has a much higher skill ceiling. 
---
There are quite a bit of weapons you can swap around to bring utility to your party, from boons to grap to reflect or conversion and overall a lot of builds variation for each fight. Pets are also a big part of the playstyle, bringing the two correct pets to each encounter and swapping between them at the right moment for various effects has a huge impact for your group, especially since chronos lost a lot of their CC potential, the druids responsibility on breakbars became ever more important.
---
While it's true that the class kinda became easier to play over the years with changes to GotL, spirits and harrier gear lowering the efforts required for consistent boons output, I'd say there is still a massive difference between a good and a decent druid and it's really not as simple a class as people make it sound. It's easy to get into a party because the class in very desirable, but it's also very easy to be kicked out of a party if you're part of the tourist druids group, camping staff and doing fuck all to help.
---
If you're willing to spend a bit time reading guides on the Druid class to familiarize yourself with the role and what you can bring to your group for each encounter then you'll be fine. No one expects you to know everything but there are plenty of ressources around to help you become the best support you can be.
---
You can play gw2 as free-to-play account with some applied limitations. Although, alt made to earn gold without expansion would be worthless as free accounts cannot send gold or items in mail. 
---
Be aware that Metabattle guides assume you are at level 80 and don't tell you what order to unlock things. 
---
Specialisation tracks are unlocked at levels 21, 45, and 71, so it's worth focussing on one until you hit the late thirties and are happy with your build as you are only able to use one of them until 45.
---
For example, for mesmer it makes sense to focus on Duelling until you hit the traits you want (and the skills you want) and leave it as it is for a while. If you bounce between them, you'll only ever unlock the low tier traits until much later. 
---
Note that you'll have enough hero points by 80 to unlock everything. Unlocking them around the map will let you unlock things earlier (which is good).
---
It will but depending on your screen it is mostly on the mini map.  It’s down in the bottom right of the screen so it’s not unbearable.

My advice would be to try it see how well it works for you and if it’s helping start searching for a cheap license.  There are tons of 3rd party vendors selling windows licenses cheaper than Microsoft.

Fair enough. I have mained a ranger since the start as I mainly roam, but every now and then I cheese it out with a warrior :)
---
is she even legal?
---
We can fix him :(
---
My question is why would he do that when he is playing NA, what use would the gold be if it's on the wrong region?  
---
A waste of money imo
---
Of course you can center the subject. Who the hell taught you that you can't? If it works, it works and if it doesn't, it doesn't. A general rule of not doing something "just because" is moronic.
---
Depends on the encounter.  If you want heavy condi-cleanse (e.g. Mathias) I would go with Auramancer... for the rest I would probably go with Firebrand.  The quickness and other boons are hard to pass up and Firebrand can bring some cleanse as well (just not nearly as much as Auramancer).
---
Well if u made video with warrior would be more easy to get amount of lost fights ;) . 
---
That is so cool
---
I meant more like how they swim and move. 
---
Most of them know damned well what they're doing. Between the /dancing, gemstore/raid thrones, and shit-talking in mapchat, it's pretty obvious many of them are doing it just to troll.
---
Just won one unranked game, but i didn't get a point for the winning rated games achievement for my nec. Still on 149/150 rated game wins.
---
To be honest, your screenshots range from "just ok" to "really awesome". I'm especially impressed by the one with astralaria and the one with twilight\~ Good luck with career and thank you for inspiration :)
---
Revenant, way more tankier then druid or tempest, with higher health pool and heavy armor ( matter a little bit ). No cooldown heals on tablet, and by far the most heals per second.
---
You didn't even mention holosmith. This is why you fail.
---
My average lead time with them is like 7 days. So just be a little bit patient :). 
---
Depends on the issue and how overflooded with tickets they are. I've had answers to tickets in less than a day. On another occassion, it took them about a week to get to me. Just be patient, they are usually super helpful. 
---
There have always been plenty of us
---
Hey there. 
---
I was wondering if anyone has had an issue with their client constantly dropping from 700+ kbs (this is normal for me as I have bad internet in the middle of nowhere) down to 0 and then the download bar disappearing completely and showing back up minutes later and the process restarting. I’ve tried reinstalling, firewall, closing out all other apps, doing the repair function, nothing works. Idk if it’s because of my connection or not but other downloads don’t so this. I’m at work today so I can’t try fixes right away, but will try them when I get home. Thanks in advance.

Taimi is secretly working for BP and one of their oil drilling platforms just poked Steve in his left eye.

New Mount: Helicopter to reach the platform

There's the "mad cuz bad" argument again, dressed up a bit.  While I'm sure it's valid in somebody's experience it's never been mine - builds and gear and rotations are beaten into anyone who so much as glances sideways at the content.  It's what the community screams about the loudest, after a lack of content and preferential treatment.  "You must be this experienced to enter" may as well be carved in stone above the Aeordrome entrance.
---
Experienced raiders seem to see the game as "raiders" and "everyone else." There's also the middle, where players show up as prepared as they can get without having previously cleared the content, then struggle like hell with it and get turned off due to factors they have no control over.  It's a lot easier to get a group of five people to work together to clear content than it is to get ten - the chief issue I've experienced in my training group isn't personalities, it isn't mechanics, it isn't rotations, it's availability.  A lot of experienced raiders don't want to spend their time on training runs; a lot of inexperienced raiders burn out quickly and don't find the idea of flailing against a boss repeatedly while somebody else learns their part to be enjoyable.  Some players have limited availability; some don't burn out on the content but on the sitting around while the group looks for a substitute.  I know what I'm doing as condi DPS for the encounters mentioned above; I also know I can handle about an hour to 90 minutes of gameplay at that operational tempo before my performance starts to degrade dramatically, and that *includes* the inevitable bench time.
---
I'm totally gonna earn a White Mantle Portal Device from consolation magnetite, and I'm fine with that.  The fact that my training group can make it to Gorse and has yet to clear him, and has made it through Samarog a couple of times, but has yet to take on Deimos, wears a bit - but the loot from making it that far is vastly better (or has a chance to be) than the average open world encounter, and that takes the edge off.  For me, anyway.
---
I really don't think this is far fetched. Anet has some mediocre writers, and the story is incredibly predictable. 
---
This is the first thing I thought when she died. How it would make sense her eating Joko would make her reincarnate, is beyond me. As soon as she died I gave a noticeable sigh and "huh", that won't last long. This is undoubtedly what will happen.
---
I think the Skritt Personal Story step has something about Destroyer eggs, though I don't remember if they explained why Destroyers were able to lay eggs.
---
Kralkatorrik approves.
---
Honestly, I hope not. Legendaries were a waste of time and placed on the back burner because they didn’t provide a profit to Anet. Just make future gem store “legendary skins” and be done with it. Obviously the ones off the gem store would be skins and not be stat swappable. 
---
Examples please. Because I find it hard to be inaccurate when the weapon skills tooltips are infront of me and I'm reading them word for word.
---
But maybe that's just me.
---
Thanks so much for this :) 
---
In before they announce the release of Gw3 in which you will be playing a branded.
---
This 
---
Scourge healer isn't an "off healer" though, it's a dedicated healer.
---
Even with condi damage or power damage on your gear, you'll still be doing a third to maybe a half of a firebrands dps.
---
Not to mention Firebrand brings reliable quickness, which to be fair usually won't be needed, but it's nice to have a little extra for unorganized groups anyways.
---
serious or baiting?
---
&gt;I want to play the game again after stopping in 2014
---
Surely if you have waited for around 5 years, a few more days shouldn't be that much of an issue? 
---
When it comes to account issues it will take some time, because they will need to make sure that you are actually the rightful owner of the account.
---
The standard waiting time seems to be around 3 days, but can be quite a bit longer if there are many tickets coming in. 
---
Y, I understand that point. However, I think it's justified for armors like the Requiem armor, because they have a special look with the dyable glowing. 
---
yeah he did this digitally.
---
Gorgeous.
---
If you intend spending money on gems at any point throughout the year, I'd say you should go for the Ultimate edition.
---
If your plan is to grind a lot instead of spending money on the game, you can go with the basic edition, and grind enough gold to purchase the deluxe editions whose bonuses you like (i.e. the lily of elon pass from POF).
---
They also go on sale sometimes, so if you are patient you can get them at up to 50% discount (1200 gems instead of 2400 per expansion).
---
As a reference currently you can get 1200 gems for about 400 gold.
---
support herald/renegade lacks ressing power so i would recommend the other 3 for pug groups
---
There is a difference between elite specs being a powercreep for all core professions and Mirage being a power creap and more overtuned then any other elite spec in PvP and WvW. Tune the condi down because even whilst doing so it will still be op but not ridiculously op.
---
I love you
---
Then you haven't spoken to a lot of people in or out of game.
---
I'm not saying nor can i guess how many think of it as a possibility.. But there are people who think of it. Purely, however.. based on gen 1 having 3 legendary GS
---
that's awful.
---
i love it
---
Thanks I'm gonna just go... *sniffles*... Cry now...
---
May want to mark for spoilers, btw...
---
why cut the price/cost of one-handed weapons by half if you can just double it for two-handed weapons? :P
---
done
---
and you should mark it as a spoiler
---
F) Just kill me instead
---
It depends on what you play, really. I usually swap one of my skills out for something that directly helps my team and maybe an AOE heal if the parts needs it, whereas my usual open world setup is more damagey. 
---
On my mesmer I rarely use a focus in open world but I use it in fractals because it is great with positioning of mobs where I want them, interrupting casters etc. I also bring Signet of Inspiration to boost boons, whereas in open world I usually use Mantra of Pain because it's a quick and easy bit of damage. 
---
For open world, I swap focus or a second sword or the greatsword or something depending on how I'm feeling. A little build swapping is expected at level 80 but you'll be fine 90% of the time. 
---
Fractals: group support and damage.
---
Open world: self-defence and damage. 
---
Spoiler 
---
[Hidden Arcana](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hidden_Arcana) is the story step you're thinking of, but it wasn't Ogden. It was an unnamed Priory Historian norn. He states:
---
Don't know any more than that. That was all they could get from the Tome of the Five True Gods. It's too damaged. Some of these scholars in here would kill to know the full name of that dragon.
---
[But in Season 3,](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Taimi%27s_Game) Taimi goes:
---
Taimi: Nothing on Kralkatorrik, and ditto for... Oh, what's its name? Brain malfunction. Starts with an s...?
---
implying she heard its name before, and in [THIS episode](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Crystal_Dragon) (warning: final story instance spoilers) we got:
---
Yeah! This is it! Today, Kralkatorrik—tomorrow Jormag, Primordus, and...and...whatever's under the sea! We're gonna do this! We're gonna save the world!
---
similarly implying that the name's known just... constantly forgotten by people. It's seems like it's become pretty much a gag that we don't know the DSD's name while Tyrians do but keep forgetting it because of how rarely it comes up.
---
Or maybe Anet will actually work it into the lore that people can never remember that dragon's name after reading it. Like the Silence from Doctor Who, but with the name instead of the beings.
---
Delete this. Joke may end up as reality.
---
I'm not sure I get it, hmm...
---
Path of Fire explains it in the story instance The Way Forward. The TL;DR of it:
---
Season 2 hinted, and Season 3 confirmed, that killing Elder Dragons is bad for The All's balance. Ruin the imbalance far enough (e.g., 3 dragon deaths) and the world dies. Yes, there's the magic issue but the main problem is The All's balance.
---
Path of Fire confirmed that Glint's Legacy is the plan to replace the Elder Dragons, to create "new Elder Dragons" and kill the old ones, so that The All and magic remain balanced.
---
End of TL;DR
---
Glint, Vlast, and Aurene were all critical to that plan, each intended to replace an Elder Dragon. Originally, Glint was to replace Kralkatorrik, and it seems Aurene was intended to replace Mordremoth given Tarir's location (who Vlast was intended to replace was unclear, but I'd guess Zhaitan given Kesho's location).
---
When Glint died, one of the scions were intended to replace Kralkatorrik instead. Due to Vlast's death, that became Aurene.
---
We could only kill Kralkatorrik because we had Aurene, ready to replace Kralkatorrik and prevent further imbalance of The All.
---
I crash when the riftstalkers spawn during Thunderhead Keep meta (with an option to send a report, if that matters). Talked to friends who are getting the same thing.
---
Hell if Kralk Brands everything I just want the event from the beta weekends back
---
&gt; similarly the way it was mentioned in Asuran personal story step as well.
---
Nononononono, don't say that's similar to Blish. 
---
The "Golems" in the story were actually Armor Suits. The suits were mind controlled and the body were still inside the suit.
---
This "mind controll golem without bein able to leave" thing is completely different to what Blish did, transer the mind into a golem.
---
Remember how Faolain turned into some monstrosity when she got corrupted by Mordy? Maybe similar will happen with Caithe.
---
&gt; There is literally no reason for doing that without Aurene.
---
The original plan was to have Aurene absorb Kralk's magic so the magic balance is maintained but by a "good" dragon. If I remember correctly, Taimi postulated that if Kralk is killed then the magic balance is disrupted and Tyria is destroyed. 
---
Why would they be. If their support does anything like others do, they reviee all of the messages from one account, not just one Specific one. And when they see its the same messsge, it won't take time. 
---
ppl have complained when the max lvl booster came out but most have come to just accept it
---
I mean, we did it with Glint in GW Prophecies. It’s not that far fetched. 😬
---
Heroes are terrible. 
---
&gt; Mesmer is about confusing and redirecting you to attack its clones instead of itself. Of COURSE axe 3 is going to de-target you. Of COURSE ambush is going to detarget you. That's the point.
---
Except there's already a mechanic for detargeting. It's called stealth! There's another mechanic that literally forces your opponent to attack a clone. It's called taunt! Now why should mes get yet another mechanic that detargets them?
---
Mesmer's weapon abilities are so overloaded with stuff. Just on axe 3 it has good physical damage, high confusion, shadowstep, illusion target switching, evade, detargeting, and even a leap finisher because why not? Either it should have damage OR utility but not both. Jawgeous wants to remove the detargeting but if keeping the utility is important, then the damage should be removed. Same for the other weapon skills.
---
&gt;am I just an old school gamer that is moaning because I don't like new things or loud music?
---
Most likely.
---
But to answer the title question: Bad if you don't know what you're doing. Good if you do.
---
IMO the game will end only when the dragons are replaced.
---
y'all are terrible ppl
---
Is there a particular day and time when the NA servers reset to allow for someone to once again do the the level 10 Black Lion key acquisition?
---
Seriously 'baiting.
---
You can't make it a sense of achievement if all a new player wants to do is take part in all the fun stuff their friends are doing. 
---
It's not a sense of achievement when you're on your 4th, or 10th, or 20th character.
---
It's good for accessibility.  It's bad for the people that jump to 80 and ask, "now what?"
---
What about Blish?
---
Simply do it and complete 1-2 starter zone Maps and you are gucci. It gives you an shared inventory slot for the copper fed salvaging tool etc so you dont have to switch the bank all the time.
---
And then she will get time travel power, then she will aid us in the past, present when the commander was lost.
---
Yep, Aurene is Mr. E
---
We call our mounts siege engines and dune rollers.
---
*chuckles smugly*
---
&gt; I just want to make use of the teleport instead of spending on waypoints
---
If you're trying to merchants, just press "B" and select "Obsidian Sanctum". In the starting area of the Sanctum, you're surrounded by merchants, armor repair, trading post, etc. When you're done, hit "B" again, then click on the door icon in the bottom-right corner of the popup. You'll be take right back to where you were before you hit "B" the first time.
---
Sylvari ranger for me!  
---
I like the plant people and I like ranged+pets. Both druid and soulbeast are amazing imo
---
Let’s pull charr’s tail!
---
i doubt it's allowed
---
&gt; I'm gonna try doing high level dungeons soon but I need proper equipment 
---
Please don't tell me you think viper's or commander's gear is proper equipment for dungeons on a ranger.
---
Thanks for the tip!

Female human elementalist
---
Thanks! :3

We never stood a chance.
---
I, for one, welcome our new aquatic overlords
---
Well.. I wouldn't be surprised if they released 2 which can be forged together AND THEN you can forge the combination of both and eternity to the ultimate overkill status item. The be all end all of legendary weapons. 
---
Just activate any other mastery line. That popup only happens if the current mastery line is 100% filled **AND** you have another mastery that you *could be filling*. So, the popup *is not* telling you that you need to spend MPs. It's telling you that you're missing out on filling another mastery line.
---
If you have no unfilled mastery lines, and there's nothing left for you to do but farm MPs, the popup doesn't happen.
---
Is this Charr only or do the hairy Norns get in too?
---
Personally I don’t se the use of it what so ever. Since you can already se it in:
---
Squad
---
Party
---
Guild
---
Friends-list
---
I deem it more clutter in the chat box. But I’m fine if it gets added as long as it won’t be set as a standard.
---
There are so many reflects and missile blocks in the game, that hipshot is kind of obsolete.  A Mesmer can easily win a 1v1 against a rifle engie, (they can win against any profession), and their 1200 range teleport can also bring them up a ledge or to a pillar to LOS. It’s absolutely not misrepresented. It will grant you at least 2 seconds of damage reduction using Blink (if not completely escaping the fight all together) and staff 2 will put you in a position to avoid at least half a second.
---
Again, these numbers are lowballing it, if anything I’m underrepresenting their strength.
---

you are not forced to use that lvl 80 boost you know? use it or dont - youc choise.
---
It does feel like an achievement when you level your first character, but later it just feels like boring waste of time. 
---
I have been there, I have done that and it is enough for me. After that I just wanna enjoy endgame content
---
I never liked the leveling. 
---
Purple was the 2nd room before I logged out, so I guess it means logging into a new map instance reset puzzle rotation
---
... I would play another game with lots of alts
---
Most of the time, people just run the power Dragonhunter build, but with Firebrand traits instead (223). Mobility Mist Potion is needed with 150ar to get all the boon duration you need.
---
You could run some Diviners/Commanders gear to pad the boon duration if you wish.
---
Basically [this](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vVAQNArdRnsADFChVBBGBDEEhl4BzqEkvSBVBgGQ9a/lWT7pA-jlRBAB4pPgS1fua/R5HAPBAzUC+wpAIAwBw5Nv5nH48zP/8zPvmf+5nf+5nf+5nXKgImsB-w)
---
 So I recently reinstalled GW2 and I have got to same I like it so far, dynamic, not as grindy as other MMOs. I had played it a bit a long time ago, but it's not nearly enough to say that "I have played the game".
---
And I go around, level and do quests and all that, not completely clueless, I am quickly getting the hang of it. After all I played WoW for many years (just as many years ago). But I can't help but feel like I'm kind of playing blind. Without much direction.
---
So I have a few questions:  
---
I am currently playing free. When should I start thinking about investing in the expansions? And are both necessary?  
---
Should I just follow the main story and do quests in zones appropriate for my level or is there something more to it?  
---
When is a good idea to start looking for a guild to join? How would one go about doing that?  
---
Any other pointers for a newcomer?
---
you completed the bottom archievement 5 times so thats 5\*150 = 750
---
 \+ 75 from the current = 825 times.  
---
and you placed top 3: 212 times  
---
so thats \~1 in every 4 runs  
---
Thanks a lot, guys! I'm definitely having too high of an expectation for myself, I need to give myself some more time and practice! It's great to hear some positive things about Thief, I won't give up. I revisited both Spellbreaker and Holosmith, and they seem pretty nice as well. I was turned down by both cause of pretty stupid reasons that I can work around with time. I won't make any harsh decisions for now, I'll try playing all 3 in sPvP for now, and later on pick the one that I'm most comfortable with. Thanks for your input! 
---
I'd probably main a Norn Herald/Renegade because of the versatility. 
---
Yeah depends on the personality. I know people who hate having content gated and can organize their own leveling and exploration. Boosts are good for them.
---
Then there's people who don't want to read the wiki or external sources. Its best to not boost if that's the case.
---
&gt; I did the same thing with dyes.
---
Me too. And miniatures.
---
For the sake of your soul, **DO NOT** learn anything about the [Mini Griffon Hatchling Collection](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mini_Griffon_Hatchling_Collection) or the raptor, jackal, or springer versions.
---
You know, I never really realized or thought about the importance of your point 2 until now.
---
That was our whole role in Glint's plan, wasn't it? Stabbing out his eye and injuring Kralky so much may have been what made him slip up and forget to nom on Aurene. Which may be just the thing that allows whatever is going to happen to happen.
---
1. Get expansion when you reach 80 and finish the personal story. 
---
2. Yeah for a free account that's basically it. Do dungeons (story + explorables) whenever you get access to them as well. 
---
3. I'd recommend guild recruitment on reddit.
---
Why people always like silvary, they are ugly af 
---
Human Elementalist. I've already been playing it for three times as long as my eight other characters combined.
---
Same [build](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vVAQNAR7dnsADtChFCBGBDEEhl4BrKA0AqXWlg8Vka/lWT7pA-jBBXgAPKBD1N0r+Dw+jyPA-e) and rotations as power dh but without traps ofc . You dont need boon duration for 100% quickness in fractals. 
---
I like that the rich person with nightfury has t3 cultural and bunny ears, pretty accurate
---
oh thank you thats not so bad , im full hd not 4k , was asking cause i only have 8gb of ram :P
---
Cripple ticks 15 break bar damage per second. She'd do the job herself

Im currently working on the Incinerator but still lack mithril for the precursor collection.

And I can't claim to have had to deal with any karka underwater Oo
---
Trahearn?  Didn't he die after Eir?
---
That's what pvp lobby and obsi sanctum are for
---
A friend of mine juts begin this week, he ask me if he should buy the game now to get the booster to get 80.  
---
I said that it's probably the worse idea he could ever had on this game. You feel so lost if you do this without knowing anything. Gw2 is a way more complicated that it appears and i dont see any benefit for new players to boost to lvl 80 
---
bTw im doing map exploration with him and having a lot of fun, Hell the Jumping puzzle are good even if i complete them all one already
---
I like the idea of Aurene awakening the remaining/dead elder dragons 
---
 as her minions. Distributing magic to them evenly.
---
Would Herald or Renegade be easier?
---
I was leaning towards Herald because of free boons and Shield.
---
Happy cake day
---
Charr Necromancer. My main since I started playing, and to deal with all those pesky Ascalonian ghosts.
---
i already play only one character, My Charr Enginner. Love the engineer theme in games and that's why i've only sticked with one character
---
Mystery contributes a lot to great storytelling, and there is a lot of lore about all of your points that have been scattered across a decade of game development and 2 games.  
---
They [actually gave us more of Joko's backstory recently](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Diary_of_Palawa_Ignacious_Joko), and his character has been a prominent figure in GW lore since Nightfall.  To keep things consistent with the world it's hard to just dump all of his history on us as a character since he has very specifically made a mission of corrupting all of the history books with his name.  I really feel like you missed a good chunk of the story in PoF and Season 4 if you have no idea who Joko is though.  
---
As for Braham and the Norn: this can easily be explained by [Norn culture](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Norn#Culture).  They are not a race that forms armies; this has been made abundantly clear many times.  They are all individual warriors that choose to fight for their own glory and bragging rights.  Those who chose to follow Braham did so of their own free will and it is not in the Norn's nature to fault Braham for their choices/failures.  Again, I really feel like you missed some significant points in Season 3 regarding all of this.  
---
As for the gods? That's a mystery that has been slowly unraveling since GW1; I'm just as eager to find out as you are.
---
they're prob vegans IRL so tney have to let everyone know in-game they like salads!!! 
---
Story mode takes you in there to....You guessed it:  Kill the Veteran Graveling.  
---
But at least it does get you in there :/
---
Me and my guildies we call him bipedal pregnant crocodile ;)
---
I can't help but feel like Kralk looked incredibly derpy in this shot... Face-on is definitely not his good angle.
---
Very likely then, I've always been assigned back into the same instance so I could never accurately check, but good to know if different instances have different puzzle patterns.
---
&gt; Wasmaa is the forgotten
---
Brah, she's an Exalted, who were humans. Silly OP.
---
Caithe: "Not corruption, but connection. She offered and I accepted" or something along those lines.
---
i don't mostly because i'm against the idea of making aurene the one true god of magic. also that'd cause issues with zhaitan and mordremoth

Renegade because of Alacrity

Heal scourge is so fucking nice to play. You can literally carry an entire raid if played well. Also, dat ressing power &lt;3

aside from all the suggestions, you can also turn them into mats and by extension quite a bit of gold by buying [this item](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pact_Scout%27s_Mapping_Materials) from the 6 [Pact Agents](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pact_Supply_Network_Agent). you can only buy them once from each agent so 6 a day. buy them , store them and use [the reward guide(https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Map_bonus_reward/profit) to maximize profit. all you do is choose the best week and the best map, go there and use all the stored mapping materials to get insane amount of T6 mats.

Tempest has a ton of CC in Earth and Air
---
Just adding that making a screenshot and saving it somewhere reduce the security unless you add something to make sure that it can't be easily compromised.
---
Saving it in an email, on your computer defeats the purpose of 2FA.
---
If Cantha is destroyed off screen I will never touch Guild Wars 2 again.
---
Under water mounts added with an expansion?  Gimme, gimme.
---
Heal tempest does just fine in full exotics for raids.  I wouldnt waste time and money on ascended unless you are diehard planning to use it in fractals, and even then its not remotely normal or meta in that game mode.
---
Same for all the non-boon related supports.  If you want boons, then making harriers or minstrels is ideal but you might as well make it ascended at that point since its already expensive at the exotic level.
---
I feel you. I feel you very much. Sad truth is: the people that will remember you will remember your account name, not one of your 15 toon names
---
OH! Copy that. Thank ye! That's about 3:30 pm in my timezone then.

Male Sylvari Thief at launch, remade him as a Revenant at launch of Heart of Thorns. Sylvari has the best "experience" regarding the story and voice acting, in my opinion. I just want the ability to wield the full Caladbolg on him someday soon.
---
My problem is that the world seems to be on sleep mode until we enter it. There is nothing happening without the commander being present.
---
Its what I really enjoyed about FFXIVs story for example you are out hunting a bad guy and then in the midst of that story you get a phone call "A revolution broke out in major city", we need your help. So you go to the city and deal with a totally unrelented issue, which is an entire story arc on its own. The bad guy you were chasing took that time to start genociding the people where you left them and boy when you return they are actually pissed that you left them. In the meantime another bad guy prepares a summoning ritual in the east so your teammate has to leave to save their home.
---
In gw2 the world is frozen. Nothing happens except you are present. You deal with Zhaitan, other dragons do nothing. You deal with the white mantle, no other faction abuses your occupation. They all patiently wait until its their turn.
---
Yup, saving it in an email or somewhere randomly on the computer surely is bad and reduces the security. Therefore I added the "somewhere safe" statement. If "online" then in an encrypted form, better yet "offline" (in a printed form) in a safe place.
---
I’m sure there’s a portion of the fandom that happens to be into adult-baby lifestyles. Probably the same percentage of people that are into flying airplanes or sculpting pottery; one interest or proclivity (sexual or not) doesn’t always mean that another coincides with it, if that makes sense. There are definitely horror stories about people acting obscene or unsanitary in public (and they should rightfully be shamed for that), but I think the “ew furries are just shit-encrusted freaks” sentiment should be left in 2006.

I still want Taimi to get a new body.

Something similar to the dynamics exo-suit, but instead having a golem eye over the face, have something that can show expressions, like a magically animated clay or a LED screen.

Synergetics Exo-Suit.
---
I'm not even mad.
---
nah, that cant be the bug. I entered the room with a dozen other players at the same time (we were in a room teleport squad) and I decided to get the chests first. in the mean time the graveling got killed twice and I got the plate like 5 minutes later...
---
Depends on what you want.
---
- Definitely buy the [Prototype Position Rewinder](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Prototype_Position_Rewinder) at some point. Very useful gizmo.
---
-Keeping an eye on [Pact Supply Merchants](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pact_Supply_Network_Agent) for useful food and superior rune/sigil recipes can save you from having to buy these wares from another player via TP and save gold
---
Some cosmetic stuff that you can blow karma on if you like it:
---
-Living story minis from heart vendors chew up about 100k karma a pop
---
-Same with the various [Tonics](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tonic) if that's your thing
---
-Collect all of the tier 3 [Cultural Weapon skins](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Cultural_weapon), along with the pirate, vanguard, and lionguard skins (I thnk this is upwards of 6 million karma, so it should keep you busy if you go this route)
---
While the fake invasions are mildly annoying, they are nothing compared to the Joko fakeouts Anet tried out for bounties in Sandswept.  Those were flat out throw your mouse at the monitor times.  You would wait a long time for the one bounty you need to pop up to then get a joko instead.
---
Well, ArenaNet are actually helping people to get access again, but they are not going to rush something that could end up putting the account into the wrong hands so of course it will take time. 
---
I am also getting quite tired of people putting all the blame on the company for them not having access to the accounts. It is YOUR account, it is YOUR responsibility to make sure it stays safe and you have access to it.
---
I have taken break from plenty of games many times, and yet I have still always been able to login when I get back after a break, due to making sure I actually have a password I remember, having my 2FA active and working and so on. So obviously it is fully possible to take a break, come back and just login and play, if one just cares a bit about ones account security. 
---
I literally cried when he died, how could anyone forget. He was apart of dragon watch too. 
---
What if Taimi gets the Caithe treatment from (however she returns) Aurene? That could save her (maybe?) from it while still letting us preserve her in her mostly normal form.
---
Obsidian Shards, but there are [lots of other ways to get them](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Obsidian_Shard#Sold_by), so it is no longer 100% required to buy them with karma at Balthazar temple.
---
They were both just examples of craftable only gear. But yes, for Condi Soulbeast I think Vipers is proper equipment 
---
Probably from buying all obsidian shards with karma. 
---
Bubbles is either E or Anise. Convince me otherwise.
---
You only have 1 full ascended set? Or multiple? If you only have one give your toons one as well. Having asc on all your characters is awesome ocd-wise and also really nice to have
---
Anet has been good with content and I'm generally happy with the game, so I have no problem rewarding the company with the extra 20 dollars.
---
It's a 2FA for a game...not a dead body you're trying to hide. Why would anyone go through your computer stuff for that anyway..
---
If you want to play "competitively", you'll need Elite specs, which require the expansions. You get one free lvl 80 boost for each expansion you buy, so there's that if you really wanna skip leveling and go straight to endgame. Also, keep in mind sPvP doesn't require anything from you, from a lvl 1 crook you just created, you can fight the lvl 80 mafia boss without ANY handicaps. For WvW (open world PvP), you'll need levels and gear, though the progression cap is really low, you can get decent enough gear (exotics) the same day you boost your character (well, it depends in the build I guess).
---
About class choice, I made a thread about it recently, if you're interested https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/agqx4t/wvw_roaming_main_choice/
---
I think Thief is the class with the most outplay potential, as nothing you do is particularly strong, you really have to read your opponent and play perfectly (some classes just brainlessly burst rotations and win a lot of duels by brute force). It has mobility, stealth, dodges/i frames, interrupts on demand, that kind of thing. It really feels like "outplaying", playing *against* your opponents game. All classes have a bit of that, but it's specifically true for thiefs, IMO. I'm a scrub myself so don't take my opinion too seriously though, but I'm speaking from what I've heard from good players and from general playtesting. 
---
Also, you can "try" any class at any point in sPvP, so even if you say you don't want to spend time trying out classes out, well, you don't need to level them or anything. Just make a new character, try it out for a few minutes and get the general feeling for it, then delete it and try a new one. No real commitment. Spending a few hours trying everything out before making a major decision feels like a solid deal for me. 
---
Burn the furries
---
Forgetting a password after years isn't out of the ordinary. Responding to a forgotten password request is something almost every other developer can do in a day or two, not a week. I guarantee if I went to reset WoW or FF XIV I'd be connected with support and assisted today.
---
Security is not the issue here. Poor response time is 
---
To be real? probably Human Necromancer, i woud be able to run all contents in the game and not suck badly at it... inst the optmal but inst bad at all, as necro you can:
---
1 - Do every raid boss (Even KC you just need that power build... is not GREATDPS but is still doable)
---
2 - Do my daily fractals, i know that power rule there but necro still decent...
---
3 - and wvw.....
---
I didnt forget my PW.
---
I just didnt deactivate 2FA when leaving the game wtf.
---
I have 3 hours response time from blizzard, 6hours from steam, 24h from nearly every other game I played...  
---
I dont give a shit what would have been my rep, they should be happy I consider buying 2 expansions.
---
ikr. Mirage (and mesmer) have skills that are super similar to thief but they do extra things that would cause absolute outrage if thief had it. That's not even including the base goodies that mes has access to that thief doesn't, like clones, portal, and distortion.
---
Just compare:
---
Thief sword chain -&gt; mes sword chain (and its stealth vs ambush attack)
---
Thief mainhand pistol -&gt; mes scepter
---
Thief shortbow auto -&gt; mes staff auto
---
Choking gas -&gt; Chaos storm
---
Disabling shot -&gt; Phase retreat (can be cast when disabled, leap finisher)
---
Headshot -&gt; Magic bullet
---
Shadow shot -&gt; Axes of Symmetry
---
Shadow Flare -&gt; Crystal Sands
---
Steal-&gt;Arcane Thievery: why is thievery unblockable?! (just for flavor why does mes have a skill called thievery lol)
---
I mean, he would be feeling like I am feeling right now, because seeing my little dragon child like that at the end of the episode certainly made me "despondent" and at the same time i was pissed off as well. If he isn't a drunken angry bitter mess in a bar in his races capitol city by the start of the next episode i am gonna be thoroughly disappointed. 
---
The only other option to the bar would be in a strategy meeting with some kind of nuke to drop on Kralk.
---
bullshit. they can just delete the ticket in the "wrong" language. takes literally 1min
---
I don’t want permastealth as an aspect of this game either, how is it fun to get one shot out of stealth for 22k? This change doesn’t remove stealth, it removes PERMANENT stealth, which is a good thing imo
---
So what's your favorite crackpot theory?
---
Coming back to the game sfter a few years away, thinking of playing ranger. Any tips or advice for a returning player? (I only made it to about level 60 last time I played)
---
Aw, thanks! 💕 The whole convention has me beyond excited — I kind of want to make and run around in some sort of “giant”, proportional choya costume!
---
All of u r haters. Mesmers are 4ever!!!
---
Doesn't really change my point that you don't HAVE to spend karma on them.
---
&gt; “oh look, I got a key from normal gameplay” every 1 or 2 weeks.
---
Well they did that via personal story.
---
...I wouldn't be surprised if that meant nothing in the end. Anet is **TERRIBLE** for closing plots.
---
Remember the Pale Tree beyond the seas? Neither many people because it never got a closure.
---
Remember our Herald and how it's hyped up during the main game? And how it ends up being a completely missable, non voice acted NPC that happens to be your fangirl.
---
Remember Zojja? And how she seemingly just stopped existing.
---
Remember Marjory's sister? And how that didn't get any sort of closure during HoT, just barely mentioned.
---
Remember the hints at Anisse/Jenna being Lyssa and them having cool powers? Then they drop it.
---
Remember the White Mantle? And how they just decide to make Demmi show up to kill her in seconds and then just end the White Mantle like it it could be that easy.
---
Remember Lazarus? And how they dropped him in GW1 so he could return as generic boss in GW2.
---
I said this before and I say it again: For me this wasn't a good end to the chapter, because either what we have said is all true and shows how predictable Anet writting can be, or it's not true and this means they have pushed themselves into a corner. Since HoT they've just been presenting downer endings, deaths and bad situations that keep scaling, to the point even the lore aficionados have theories about immortality and such. To get out of this Anet will either break its lore and canon or pull some incredibly BS move.
---
Seeing Choya cosplay, with their little butts included, would be quite the delightfully bizarre sight.
---
Well I still think, that the implemented behaviour is unintended and will be fixed. The philosophy of gw2 always was that it should feel good to have other people around and in this case it does the exact opposite.
---
U gonna need obsidian shards. 
---
I see them get a fair bit of use in larger blobs, though it's clear that the preferred support class is Firebrand.  I've only played a little bit of Scrapper myself, but I do play support FB when I WvW and it feels like that spec brings quite a bit more to the table.
---
Snow Crows be like 'CM and raid bosses are so predictable, it's time to test meta rotations on the most dangerous hitboxes... other players."
---
I feel like a patoot-toting, maraca-wielding choya piñata wouldn’t be out of place at a furry convention at all. Shake-a-shake-a-shake-a!
---
Learn WvW, learn Pve raids, craft legendary weapons and armor, collect all of the minis and or dyes, do lots of map competition.
---
If she could she would have tought about it ages ago.
---
Since LWS3 she said SHE CAN'T. PERIOD.
---
I'm on most nights and weekend. Feel free to add Daemonicon.3107 if you need a sidekick. 
---
Ranger race wouldn’t matter to me. But a ranger can do both support and dps very well for my game modes.
---
A lot of people use gear as an endgame goal to achieve, im not saying that necessarily wrong but its the most trivial aspect of progression. 
---
Gear in this game is mostly just a means to achieve your end. The real endgame isnt gear, its content. In most other games you grind for more and better gear but in this game you grind to do as much content as possible. If you arent interested in pvp thats fine but its part of the entire guild wars experience. The game modes are designed so that you hop around difference experiences. 
---
Fractals, raids, wvw and pvp have progression thats more advanced than just what you wear. Raids are the most challenging content in pve and yet you can complete them using masterwork gear. Its because the endgame is skill based. Active dodging and maximizing damage is way more intuitive gameplay than grinding for more gear so you can enter higher ilevel raids. 
---
If you dont want to do any of this you can also go for better looking stuff. Legendaries and specific craftable armor will sure turn eyes and make you look good. 
---
Whatever you decide to do have fun! 
---
Yea they are both very solid. You can even do a dps boon focused renegade which is very good in fractals now when paired with a similar firebrand.
---
Thanks for all the help guys! I appreciate it.
---
I don't imagine Blish even has a backup copy of himself. He isn't a program necessarily. To our understanding he's an actual soul transfer.
---
The thing that makes me curious is this: if we still have a *functioning* tracker *inside* Kralk, that means that it hasn't been totally destroyed. I just wonder what other elements may have survived, and if Blish's soul/body could be salvaged at some point.
---
Not only that, if he did 100% die, did his soul move on to the Mists or get consumed by Kralk?
---
Sometime it's good. Sometimes it's not.
---
My first character was a Ranger , then a Scourge and then a Condi Mirage. I leveled them all the normal way and did map completion with the Scourge. I wanted a Power Mirage for Istan. No way was I gonna levlel up Mesmer the normal way again. I didn't use the instant 80 but I used book, same thing-ish.
---
I wanted a Guardian but didn't want to level him up, so I boosted him. Two days later I get highest damage and most kills in PVP consistently. I'm basically using the same build as I use in PVE except in PVE I added some Valkyrie gear.
---
So, dunno if the level boost are a bad thing. Still contemplating using my second boost on a Reaper or an engineer. Currently leveling up a Thief/Daredevil the normal way because I like the leveling process.
---
Welcome back to GW2 :)
---
Expanding a bit on the other answer regarding the expansions:
---
Both expansions come with content for lvl 80, including story, maps (with meta events in each), elite especializations (trait lines that change the class's playstyle and enhance it), the revenant class (buying either will unlock it), masteries, gear stats, and more. The main difference between the two are that chronologically, HoT comes before PoF, and that HoT introduces gliding and PoF introduces mounts.
---
If you're enjoying the game again so far and are about to reach level 80, I'd definitely suggest you buy an expansion! You can decide to buy one or the other, depending on your budget and what interests you from each, you don't *need* both (although I'd suggest you do, if you can afford it). Mounts make exploring the world much faster, but my personal favourite meta events are all in HoT maps (which are also the most popular in-game, so there's always enough people for them). There are also really fun elite specs in both of the expansions, you can check on [Metabattle](https://metabattle.com/wiki/MetaBattle_Wiki) which specs are more effective for whichever game mode you're interested in. It's also worth noting that the best gold farm map is in Living World Season 4 Episode 1 (Istan, PoF), but the maps that make getting ascended trinkets the easiest are in Living World Season 3 (HoT), and that condi builds all need HoT stats to be viable.
---
If you want some more time before deciding, you should consider trying out Fractals of the Mists! They're improved dungeons. You can do the first 19 levels without any ascended items equipped (after that, you need Agony Resistance and it can get quite pricey).
---
&gt;You can't just spend roughly 3 1/2 years (from hatching to now) building this up only to immediately throw it out for something else
---
...It's Anet dude, they can.
---
But they're kind of self aware. Like the Ventari asking the commander about Sylvari society.
---
Revenant, simply because of Unrelenting Assault.
---
No moment is more satisfying than the moment when two dueling Revenants disappear into the mists, teleporting and evading each other in a dance of fog.

---
Alright, so you forget to deactivate a security measure before getting rid of the client that said security measure require? I still don't see how that is the fault of anyone other than you to be honest. 
---
I on the other hand have had to wait days even up to a week on both Blizzard and Steam. Not to mention Turbine (nowadays Standing Stone Games), but going around throwing anecdotes is quite pointless. 
---
Well, surely you should also be happy about them making sure some random person can't just come in and claim your account, as well? 
---
If you need shards again, definitely get them with unbound magic, extremely fast to farm and does not eat up your precious karma that can be used for mini/skins.
---
I’ve been away a touch, but is there an account limit on farming keys now?  Like you can only get the personal story key for new characters a couple times?
---
Indeed, forgetting a password isn't out of the ordinary. But the issue here isn't a simple password, it is removing 2FA, which surely they should spend some time on making sure it is indeed the rightful owner? 
---
Hm? Interest, because my experience of Blizzard have been quite the opposite, with it taking up to a week to get a response. 
---
Accept a mutation that cures your terminal condition but changes your body for good?
---

---
Generic "Play whatever you like" comment.
---
Dude, I got told to claim it! Blame Summit for forcing me to cap it. :-(
---
oftentimes i think there is no difference tho
---
The level 10 key can only be obtained once per week. The others are per character as normal. So what a lot of people do is have a character they delete every week and run to the end of the level 10 story for a key then delete. 
---
There are some people who will take that character to get all the keys available (level 10 story, level 30 story, level 60 story, HoT: Roots of Terror, LS2: Tangled paths) and sometimes do Bloodstone Fen for a gamble on a key, because map completion there is super short. But that takes a lot, lot longer and I'd imagine most only care enough for the 1 key a week :) 
---
They won't.
---
Though what made me fell in love with this game is a human mesmer, I kind of believe sylvari is the canon player character in this game, especially after HoT.
---
Minion master is my favorite build, so I like this 👍🏼
---
I'd give Rev another shot. Is it great for a new player? Not really, but it seems to fit what you want better than Spellbreaker which a lot of people are recommending (SB's have a more "facetank damage" type of sustain through high HP, passive healing, endure pain, resistance &amp; stab access rather than dodges\blocks\mobility etc, although they do have a bit of those as well with shield and Greatsword).
---
Power Rev is fun and extremely high skill cap but also arguably high skill floor so when starting out on it you might be a free kill to a lot of people. When you do learn it though, it survives mostly through chaining dodges, evade skills, block, kiting, CC etc which seems to be what you want, and dishes out a lot of damage. It's fun to duel with.
---
Rev is highly subjective in terms of it's playstyle as a class though, it really is not for everyone. Either you fall in love with the general rhythm of play with the legend flipping and the energy system in return for shorter (or sometimes, none) CD's or you find it uninteresting and clunky. But gotta try to find out.
---
tu est un garcon grossier!
---
As a tip from a vet, if you happen to like any new shiny, find their recipe and source all the materials on the very first day the recipe is found. Trading Post flippers took every chance to profit. Most often, the materials used to be dirt cheap before the recipe was introduced so it costs flippers next to nothing to buy in stacks and manipulate the markets. There would be next to no ways to tell if the price will drop in the future. Mystic Coin is one notorious example. The others are Rune of Snowfall, Sigil of Mischief, Sigil of Nullification, etc.
---
I'd probably wait till an actual spec with minion related traits, currently these type of builds are only good for open world and story and you don't really spend a lot of time theory crafting for these types of builds, since open world content is pretty much a breeze on necro as a whole.
---
:D when i'm playing dps, it is a good cue to get some healing though.
---
you are assuming that the same agent is handling both tickets in different languages. If one agent sees that there are two tickets and he isnt able to understand one of them, they will be escalated to an agent who can, which means they are back in a new queue and it will take even longer for you to get a response. Anet said many times that they have agents that do nothing else all day than closing duplicate tickets. If they wouldnt need to do that, those agents could actually SOLVE tickets instead of cleaning up your mess.
---
Closing a ticket does not only involve clicking a delete button, those agents need to file paperwork for every ticket they solve or close for in house documentation, which take more than one minute.
---
i agree
---
I second holosmith, also spellbreaker is good too. Ofc the easiest would be mesmer.
---
Remember that the devs have said that thwee will be a new mount.
---
As long as people have boons, you aren't dead, heal skills are used situationally and not with a rotation, spirits are used right, Elite spirit actually revives people, pets-weapons-traits set correctly according to the boss if more heal, boon distribution, condi cleanse, crowd control or proper pushing needed;  Desmina golems are pushed, Dhuum's messengers are kited and greens are done...
---
Yeah, druid is super easy buddy.
---
On EU at least, *most* roamers are not great to say the least. Definitely not a high bar for a new player to reach. If you're a Gold-level PvP player you should be able to come in to WvW and win most 1v1's.
---
1vX is a different story but that's not something a new player should look at anyway. Most people who gang up 1v3 or whatever are not great players either, anyway. The actually good roamers in WvW tend to roam alone and not join in on gang rapes because they're looking for good fights.
---
11/10 mesmers would disagree about the anet love part while pointing at recent patch notes but yeah you probably know better =)
---
Yeah don’t I have to level up to 80 again 
---
I love it cuz he looks like he has a shit eating grin. 
---
Weaver has a shit ton of cleave but is one of the hardest classes to play.
---
Heal Scourge will make a mediocre group feel like they're Gods in fractals and not even realize it's the Scourge. Barriers, plus heals and maybe a little might thrown in can compensate for a lot still.

---
Same complaining about anet not correcting tool tips and fucking sword auto chain is idiotic lol. Complain about chaos condi mirage and scepter. Just another idiot who refuses to learn how to fight mesmers 
---
All the credit they got from me during season 3 (which was mostly excellent indeed) they blew up with wasting Lazarus in episode 6.
---
If you are as nice and friendly in the ticket as you are hear, I can totally see why they wouldn't want to interact with you to be honest. 
---
They DO have a system that verifies the user, but it is not an instant system, it is a system that takes time, and why you have to wait. 
---
And no, personal questions are in general a rather bad security measure, since it is fully possible for people to actually get that information with relative ease if they know what they are doing. 
---
Point two just isnt true at least as far as Raiders In Training is concerned.  We have a super flexible hot-join system where people can post for "interest" in a specific boss or wing, and thing ping for a Trainer to come join them if enough interest is available. Or a trainer who has some free time can ping all of the Trainees to see if they want to form a run.
---
We dont generally do "sign ups" except for really difficult and time consuming bosses to train, like Dhuum.
---
If you have an hour of time, you have time to raid essentially in our environment, it just depends on if others have interest during that time period, arent at work, etc.
---
Full exotic Berserkers gear with proper runes/sigils is easily enough to raid with as well for those who are new and want to dip their toes into raiding.  In our actual Training runs we don't even care about your gear, we just want to show you the mechanics and *maybe* get a kill.
---
We see people do the above all the time, and have over 4,000 people in the server ... its absolutely not a difficult or time consuming endeavor if you want to get into the content.
---
Chrono never was a viable healer!
---
It's a tank and a support class. But for healing it's not your choice
---
Never
---
True. It will work too.
---
UNLEAA you are lazy mf (like me), which doesn't like to farm anything and doesn't enjoy doing map events :D
---
In this case u gotta use karma. 
---
This should really be a PSA. When you want to buy a 2-handed weapon, prefer the fractal vendor.
---
Someone correct me if I'm wrong.
---
PvP is filled to the brim with all-in burst builds and ultra tanky builds. Since Ele has the lowest HP, they're particularly vulnerable to burst and the tank builds can just kill the ele's small HP first.
---
And redo the map, and gear, and hero points. But it's the best you'll get. 
---
The character I started with is still my favourite: female Asura engineer. 
---
Druid is by far the easiest and best healer in PvE. Very overpowered and extremely braindead to play.
---
Best in PvP/WvW is Firebrand followed closely by Tempest.
---
If you are on NA come join us at Raiders in Training :)
---
Ascended gear is never *required* but in the case of some builds, its just more economical to go ahead and skip Exotic and go straight to ascended to save you money and time.
---
Exotic Berserkers gear is absolutely fine.  Ascended weapons are fairly easy to make and some can be earned through in game achivements, and trinkets + weapon + sigils + runes matter extremely more to a build than Armor anyways.

I don't know why they didn't make it so that there were two bombs, the normal one and a green that you're *supposed* to put on the party (or even better, a green that pulses blind and such on enemies, so you can intelligently place it on trash mobs to bypass them)

Chronomancer is really not sought after its healing capabilities .. 
---
The easy is answer is yes. Chrono is still viable in raids, mostly because there are not a lot of people playing FB or Rene yet (you need both if you're taking away the chrono cause of alacrity + quickness). 
---
If you bring rene and fb then you dont want the druid anymore, losing the spirits buffs. In theory, because Rene can still do a lot of dmg and support, you can bring a Soulbeast instead but this is still new ground and a lot of pugs dont feel confortable. 
---
Also from what I know, quickness applicaiton from FB is not as realiable as Chrono's is. Also Chrono brings other utillities like focus #4 which makes fights with adds like Sloth Xera etc much easier. 
---
If I were you, I would choose chrono. Chrono has a viable power build right now, and its spec mirage is really useful too so is just better if you kinda focus around Chrono. Guard besides FB has nothing. 
---
Also don't use metabattle, use SC's site instead. 
---
Absolutely ever single player in GW2 could do at least the first three fights of Wing 4 (Raid 2) and Escort from wing 3.
---
They are honestly on the same difficulty as *maybe* a tier 3 fractal, but have less barrier of entery due to no Agony requirements.
---
Your point is absolutely not true, and if you would like to get into raiding and are on NA, I'd love to show you the content :)
---

---
Seriously, I would probably go back to my original character if I could change my race from Human.
---
Scourge's main heal isn't even "healing." It's maintaining barriers which will soak all damage first resulting in more uptime on Scholar runes.
---
To be 100% fair, I havent had a training group have to do updrafts in over 2 years of training gorseval.
---
The DPS check is exceedingly lenient if players are playing "average" and using appropriate, normal builds.
---
In fact, I had  a "me + 9 trainee raiders" run last week during our **Raiders In Training**'s Community Raid Training Day that got it with no updrafts after about 7 pulls.   
---
&gt; Which probably told you to wait until they contact you, once your ticket is handled. Just do that.
---
why are you defending a company with a multimillion dollar revenue? wtf?

i mean since when is bad customer support a good thing, or even an excusable thing?

I dont get fanboys. jesus.
---
I knew you get set to a higher level but didn't know that you could actually do it from the get go like that. That makes testing an actual possibility then.   
---
I am f2p rn, but if I get into the game I wont shy from spending the 50bucks or whatever on the expansions. Thanks for the insightful summary on everything. Ill go give it a shot.
---
Why are raids so popular?  
---
Yeah, there's a couple Power ele builds for raids, fractals, and WvW that do well! And of course if you're just playing around doing world bosses and map events you're fine doing whatever you want.
---
Also immob on earth 5 and immob on overload.
---
Asura Scourge.
---
Tankiness in builds reduce a burst to around 15% damage (Passively regenerated in around 5 secs) where it shoud get enemy down to 30% or so on non-tank specs like scourge. Thats why the main job in teamfights is to sneaky burst and gtfo to safe zone. (or at least thats what i do ; - ;)
---
I never said it was better than scourge. I just said it has plenty of CC options. Air 3, Air 5, Earth 5, Earth Overload, Frost Bow 5.
---
Thank y'all
---
I knew you get set to a higher level but didn't know that you could actually do it from the get go like that. That makes testing an actual possibility then. Also lvl 1 crook lvl 80 mafia boss reference is ++.  
---
Ill take a look at that thread you made aswell. Thanks for taking the time to explain everything.
---
If you go in minstrel gear with the trait for healing wells and aoe healing on shatter, you're not a primary healer but you do pump out tons of supplemental healing. Not enough to keep a boss's target up, but definitely way more than enough to heal over damage auras and misc. other damage for an entire group.
---
If you want to heal, you should look at druid.
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
CC is definitely not its strong suite compared to the other supports though, and depends on which weapons you are using. Most run staff, which has very limited CC options that actually work in raids. Air 5 for example doesnt work on most break bars. Earth 5 is low break, as is the overload.
---
Awesome, thanks. At the moment, I am just doing open world stuff. I may explore raids &amp; fractals down the road. It's been 5 years or so, since I last did a fractal. For some reason I find returning to it a bit intimidating.
---
I knew you get set to a higher level but didn't know that you could actually do it from the get go like that. That makes testing an actual possibility then. With this I can actually do testing, I thought you needed to be like at least X level and even then it would be against people around your level but balanced with the same gear and level. eg. 50-59 60-69 etc. Thanks for the input!

Awesome! I can definitely help you out later after work :) Hit my up on the discord (im Swiftwynd.1685) and I'll help yea out with the rotation etc before we dive into some encounters!
---
throwing an internet tantrum wont help you either
---
If Heal Scourge's group does somehow go down, scourge can just press F4 (as long as he has transfusion trait) and bam, instantly revives everyone.
---
Chrono can tank well but gears and rotation changes a lot cuz you're a boon bot on the chrono. It's a very high skills cap class so i wouldn't recommend, although they can heal a bit with their well but not a full on healer. 
---
Druid is meta. Although as a druid myself, i can honestly say there's a huge difference between a new druid and a good druid as most people who experienced both druids can tell you that. but it can be learnt through practice. the difference is that a good druid has impeccable positioning and knowing mechanics well so he/she can drop heals when you need them to keep your health above 90% at all time, besides giving you might and other boons through their off hand warhorn, spirits, etc. in open world, you should run core ranger and switch to power base weapons if you go with druid. cuz you can't kill anything when you're on a full healer gear. on that note, gear wise it could take awhile too as harrier take some to obtain. 
---
i'm wanting to learn heal tempest and ventari herald/renegade but i haven't got time to get gears =/ there are also healing firebrand and scrapper for wvw if you happen to play that game mode. all have their pros and cons and pretty fun to play. i run healing firebrand in pvp and wvw cuz you need the burst heal and the constant boons, clearing condis and what not. it's pretty cool 
---
like i said, Tempest for raiding is fine as a an exotic healer, but for ascended yea I wouldnt waste the time :)  Its perfectly fine in full exotics, while the Renegade would benefit more from boon based stats.  Scourge also is perfectly fine in basic exotic Magi stat gear with Mercy runes.
---
Your old look deserved the black eye. The new one looks great!
---
Every single chapter I've been asked more questions than answers and then some questions just stop. I feel like PoF and this living world was to close stories from Gw1 and let them die. Lazurus/balthazar and Joko pissed me off to no end. Three incredible powers that were just villians, not super villians like they should of been. 
---
 I'm tired of dragons. They could of made some great stories with the three. Balthazar being questionable, since his story made no sense to why he flipped the switch on hating humans, from basically giving them life.
---
I'm still conflicted on this as I can't really decide if it's feasible to make a full-Minstrel tank for raids. Latest updates on SC show non-tank supports stacking power stats, making it 10% Boon duration from sigil and 40% Quickness duration from rune set, which is weird.

It's loads of fun to come in and save the day in open world meta events when a crap load of people go down on a big fight.

Awesome. I'll add ya tonight when I get on.

never said that. Although, if fanboys would stop downvoting posts to whiteknight a fucking multimillion dollar company that is only there to grab their money, posts like this might get some momentum, which might lead to Anet changing for the better.  
---
But well, fanboys will be fanboys.

---
Will do. Thanks. 
---
Please no, don’t deny me my deep sea expansions 
---
She looks really badass!
---
My Sylvari necro of either elite spec probably. Though maybe Rev too. Necro just cause I'm more familiar with it, Rev cause it's the underdog and I don't see many good ones, but I know they can kick ass if they're played well.
---
I would say Charr, since I've played Charr exclusively since launch up until recently and I still love them. But I got tired of only a handful of armour pieces looking good and the mount animations/scale for Charr are terrible. Basically I got sick of looking like garbage all the time. So I've been slowly deleting them and replacing them with plants.
---
It was shown in the previous LWE that we can't alter past events in those bubbles, aka the one with orr humans fighting charrs. 
---
That's funny because I'm a mesmer and I won't disagree with that part.
---
Must have something to do with me not being willfully ignorant about the state of mesmer, as a class.
---
Oh...I guess Aurene dies this episode. Still haven’t played it. 
---
"What's a book club?"
---
I WANT time shenanigans considering Aurene. Well... not herself exactly. I want us to go back in time with Aurene to fight previously killed elder dragons again for her to devour their magic and save Tyria from destabilizing.
---
That would make PERFECT excuse for revamped Zhaitan fight. Can you even comprehend how cool that would be?
---
Do you take constructive criticism? You should try putting some non-blues into your dye selection. He looks flat.
---
Since they added quickness to RO I cant play reaper without it anymore, it also means more burn stacks (usually 9) can be maintained, but I know what you mean.
---
I'll note it!
---
What if they weren't multiple alternate realities of Aurene dying but rather the multiple battles she we will attmpt against Kralkratorrik, were she dies and returns each time. Wearing him down to his eventual defeat.
---
I do enjoy the theory crafting a lot every since I got in GW1 with Alliance Battles and the variety of choice it the thing I miss most in GW2.  
---
Just a few splashes of another color would add some flair to it, really. He looks good, but some variance will bring it all together
---
except one detail: that medium armor human female is wearing PANTS instead of the viper's mini-skirt.
---
Sounds like Warlords of Draenor
---
Lmao
---
Difficulty has been retooled. Low level fractals are almost a joke in how easy they are. You can ignore most mechanics and just burn down everything. Upper tier 2 are closer to what you may remember them being in difficulty.
---
can you log in yet?
---
&gt; Effectively, she will ascend to such a state that death as a concept no longer applies.
---
Strike her down, and Aurene-Wan Kenobi becomes more powerful than you can imagine?
---
If Heal Scourge gets enough traction my first guess is they're going to nerf Transfusion, and make barrier scale with condi.
---
Spam those shatters, baby! Don't forget Mantra of Pain and Well of Calamity. 
---
dang, makes me wish I had taken pictures of my mesmer over the years
---
I boosted my first toon to 80 5 or 6 months back and have been having a blast since. I can't stand leveling the "normal" way in GW2 and my sense of accomplishment and achievement comes from progressing in the content I actually enjoy.
---
we knew thee well
---
Here's to hoping that doesn't happen.
---
&gt; What makes him worth bringing back into the story?
---
Maybe "he's a good villain and we're feeling lazy atm". Plus he's a lich. Intelligent, resourceful and with too much time on his hands to devise a plan B.
---
In D&amp;D liches preserve their essence in some safe place away from harm so, if they're ever caught with their pants down, they can make a comeback. But this is no D&amp;D, we know crap about how liches work in this universe.
---
I'd hate to see see Joko's skelly arse again as much as the next person. But..anything can happen it the writers say it so..
---
Being a GW1 player I have to say I was very disappointed for not being able to finish Joko accordingly. He pulled a fast one on the GW1 heroes and came out on top. We deserved this revenge. But no, our McGuffin gets it.
---
alrighty
---
Cue "Weekend at Aurene's" antics
---
dunno didnt try, since I actually just installed another game, so well, cya gw2, was a good experience, although I will need to write an amazon review on that
---
Sounds like you wanna try a weaver if you want a power dps with a decent amount of complexity. It's very rewarding when played right. 
---
The most difficult part is adjusting to changing situations, because you don't have cc on your regular rotation. 
---
Gw2 is a game that respects your time.  I can't stress how good it feels to play gw2 coming from WoW. 
---
Imagine that new tech that Guild Wars 2 brought us after years of not having it in Guild Wars. It's called jumping. Shocking, isn't?
---
#2 is most likely, #5 has most potential, but I'm hoping for theory #6 (Aurene isnt returning but we'll replace Z or M and kill K) just to bring back the penalty of death folks keep saying has been reduced.
---
I'll add staff Daredevil to the list. 
---
You get 3 dodges + staff 5, which you can spam a few times before running out of initiative. You basically take the raid build from SC, but run the trait Invigorating Precision. That plus Signet of Malice means you get decent healing just by autoing, a good chunk of health dodging into groups of enemies, and basically a full heal on staff 5 into enemies, at minimal dps loss. 
---
You blind enemies in front of you with staff 4 (for when you run out of dodges), have access to group stealth for skips, and a weapon swap to either shortbow for range+mobility or pistol/pistol for ranged damage, extra cc, and a blind field. If you really need an extra block, you can take Bandit's Defense as well.
---
I thought the events in the Ancestor Tree bubble did carry over?
---
Seems like a very fun build for open world! I don't think a full minion build has use elsewhere sadly, but the recent buff to Death Magic has left it in a pretty good state, to the point where I am trying out incorporating Death Magic &gt; Soul Reaping with Bone Minions &gt; Dessicate on Support Scourge. 
---
I’m playing the personal story as a Sylvari now for the first time after 2 years in the game. And yeah it’s insane how much differently it hits you. I can’t wait to get into the HoT story as one. 
---
omg snow crow-senpai noticed me
---
Is there a nice build to play Chrono Support with a Staff after the SoI changes? (for fractals only) 
---
I used to play chaos chrono 6 months ago and am coming back to the game just now. I really want to use a staff, but if you tell me it is completely useless right now I will give it up :(
---
I used to play staff + sword/shield, swapping shield off for a focus to pull mobs on certain encounters.
---
I'm so sorry :c   
---
I just had to.
---
Sounds like a long winded way of saying you keep boons up and wear the right gear. So, easy.
---
&gt; we're left with a gap of multiple months
---
Ever since LS3, the stories follow directly, or maybe at most with a few days/weeks between each episode. Completely de-correlated from irl calendar. Though anet still uses AE dates that gain a year in-lore for each year irl, which makes no sense to me.
---
You can use mounts in the library.
---
IT IS GOOD.
---
Also, you're in for a treat when you hit 80. The Living World and expansion content is a straight-up improvement and totally worth getting. LW Season 2 is a bit bumpy but everthing after that is amazing.
---
Aurene should turn out to be lesbian of course.
---
Haha I know 😋 I’ve done every bit of story you can right now (wasn’t around for LS1 but have watched the movie). 
---
I’m just re-experiencing the PS with a new race. 
---
It shouldn't. As a character she was really disjointed and oddly used unless it was "to save the day." I still have this feeling of "why was this even in the story" regarding her. 
---
Thats why female Charr is the new meta
---
It's the first time it's had a build that could potentially be called 'meta' in god knows how long. Pls, no.
---
PvE scum. Get this out of here
---
Mender jellyfish. They spin and shoot green projectiles. Everyone tried to dodfe thinking it's poison but it's healing.
---
So the idea is that you no longer need to focus on boon duration anymore as much as you used to. So you want to instead take as much dmg items as possible so that you can do some dps too. 
---
The basic idea is that if you're able to tank X boss with just a few tough, then go for it. However no one wants a dead chrono so if you don't feel confortable running such a risky build then go for a more defensive option. 
---
To be honest the biggest update they could do to legendary armor is to make it easier to obtain, remove legendary insights and make something like casual insight which you get for killing a boss in the open world. 
---
Too late for me :(
---
I will. I'll also try if writing by hand works
---
Snowfall and mischief are what I am missing, but at the time, 10k drinks was a huge thing to me. And they hadn't taken the sigils and runes out of the drops yet.
---
Power builds are used much more frequently, and often the preferred build. If you are going to focus on engi, work on power Holo first. Condi engi is only truly useful in a few fights.
---
Ideally you would have both a Condition and a Power build, because some bosses (Keep Construct, Vale Guardian) take more damage from direct damage, while others favor Conditions. 
---
Power Holosmith (Sword or Rifle) is a very good choice for a power build
---
Condition Holosmith is a strong condition build, but has a more complex rotation than Power Holosmith. Despite being a Condition build it does a lot of direct damage as well, and so cleaves adds slightly faster than Condi Engi
---
Condition Engineer does slightly more damage on some bosses due to higher confusion stacks, but sacrifices the Burst that Condi Holo has. Has the most complex rotation. For those that enjoy pain or just love base Engi
---
Hope that helps!
---
Yeah, easy to leech, hard to be actually useful for your party.
---
Vipers is optimal for Condi, because it also gives crit and abit of power.
---
Some classes do have pretty decent power scaling on some skills, so even a tiny bit more DPS also helps.
---
Renegades I think run Grieving sometimes because Revs in general have pretty nutty base damage and base power scaling, even on Condition skills, so the crit isn't all wasted, plus Kalla's Fervor also adds additional Ferocity to warrant its use. 
---
Best place to **TEST** build dps is in Special Forces Training Area in Aerodrome, located south of LA.
---
For now I think just roll Vipers for yur Condi characters. 
---
Could it be a 'Scruffy' mechanical suit?
---
Soon :D
---
Yay! :)
---
Well, if yu play WvW, yur obviously gonna go for WvW reward track anyway, due to how yur more inclined to farm for the Legendary Armor set in WvW over other rewards. 
---
If yur talking about general content, many people run Karma or Magic find, depending on what they prefer.
---
Stats stop going up once you reach ascended. Legendary offers nothing more than flashy looks and quality of life stuff like stat and sigil swap.
---
A "good" bow is stat dependant around exotic or ascended based on your build
---
Removing 2fa and authing is a routine issue - to the point where it could be automated (But shouldn't, due to security reasons).
---
3 day turn around time for a 'can't log in scenario' is unacceptable. Telling people "It's been awhile, so just wait some more!" is a pretty blind and almost zealot like defense of Anet - for no apparent reason. These players have some vacation time and decided to pick up and play GW2. That's not something they should have to plan 3+ days in advanced to do. That expectation of availability is literally industry standard and companies throughout the entire industry have no issue maintaining that level of support - especially for 2fa issues.
---
When was the last time bank space went on sale?
---
I am pretty sure, at least, that Aurene knew what would happen. First, she glances at us rather knowingly once we're down, just before WE cause her death indirectly as Kralky prepares to blast us, and she jumps in.
---
I think for me, it's 50/50 whether she will be revived by that Joko thing, or if it will turn out that she is now IN Kralkatorrik via being absorbed, and will defeat him from within. As she said, "I am not him" ... yet, what if she will be, sort of? :)
---
You can set WE to pause on full screen, so it doesn't eat up your RAM when you play something.
---
You make a really good point and it's a shame that you're being downvoted for it. As far as story telling goes this becomes nothing more than rehashed 80's and 90s comic book content where the good guy isn't really dead. 
---
I feel it was described best in Stephen King's Misery that this make the story feel cheap. Like the author feels the audience is stupid when the good guy is clearly dead but in the next episode somehow makes it through to save the day.
---
Aurene's death will have more emotional impact on the player if she stays dead. 
---
Thank you very much! o/
---
But at the same time, it's a Necro, and you must know the Necro curse, right?
---
I'm guessing the next balance patch will bring the nerf hammer. Sad days are upon us.
---
lol, Hex! xD Glad you like them! :)
---
&gt;old 5-man instances no longer supported
---
No longer supported? Did they get rid of them? I just started up again recently after a 2year\~ break. Haven't bothered to see if they are still there
---
It is because of the branded lightning and other effects. Turn down your graphics settings if its a problem. Not much else you can do about it except for upgrading your hardware.
---
turn off shadown effects, it work here
---
Technically you can raid as a power holo meta build for all bosses. Some bosses are better with a condi build ofcourse but the max vulnerability and CC that a power holo gives is enough to be useful even in the bosses where condi is king. Though note that it depends on your group and how experienced they are.
---
I would not advice you to play a condi holo as it is one of the more difficult builds to learn to actually play good(and I am an engi main). My advice if your new to raids, just make sure your good at power holo, and when you got enough ascended gear to gear another character, just play a condi short bow/short bow soul beast. At least you can transfer all the gear except the weapons to your engi(or my suggestion: make a 2nd engi) when you feel decent in raids.
---
Gw2 is very alt friendly, and even though I am an engi main. I have about 23 different full builds(dps/tank/heals) across my account(i got a lot of alts)for raids, because some builds/classes are better on certain bosses while others are easier or more fun to play.
---
Too soon.
---
Oh yeah, but they'd probably be calling it "Fire and Ice" or something like that, since a song is used in Game of Thrones. But yeah, a Primordus VS Jormag expansion would be incredible satisfying!
---
Well done. 
---
The queen was already full of eggs when corrupted. It's a theory your allies have during that part of the story.
---
Unrelated, I cannot stop hearing Genkai in Glint's voice. 
---
I personally prefer the Karmic Enrichment since I’m aiming to buy as much as I can from the Karma vendors all over Tyria, but Magic Find is probably more useful if you’re tagging mobs at Istan, or if you open chests in the Silverwastes, or if you’re stacking up to 600 magic find for opening unidentified gear. 
---
&gt; it can even destroy Cantha off screen
---
yes please.
---
If you dont wvw or pvp, its karma. If your farming tot bags in Halloween or anything magic find related then go with MF.
---
Your fault for looking, it has a spoiler tag ^^ sorry not sorry.
---
Unless you're killing a lot of enemies, the magic find won't really be that useful to you.
---
 The karma one on the other hand, no matter how much karma you have, you'll always run out during holiday events and other things. It's probably the best bang for your buck. 
---
Most people will have multiple ascended amulets with different enrichments so they can swap out. 
---
I currently have a wvw track and a karma one at the moment. Most of the time I forgot to swap out for the wvw. 
---
I almost forgot that Tyria actually has functional helicopters
---
I had the bad luck of not having it drop for me after six consecutive kills. Luckily each time I saw someone get it and leave, so I at least knew there was no bugging going on... but it’s still annoying. I actually deliberately left so the room would empty out before going back in. Still had one other person there, but finally got it. Still, not a great system. Hopefully it’ll be fixed.
---
Gilded Enrichment: +20% gold from monsters....monsters drop rarely a couple of silvers, so it's like 20 copper every now and then.  
---
Magical Enrichment: +20% magic find, this stack with all possible magic finds you can obtain, so, hypotetically, you can reach a default value of +320% (probably more, since by that time you'll also get some magic find from achievements).
---
Experience Enrichment: +20% from killing mobs...I mean, if you really need those mastery exp, maybe? otherwise I don't see it becoming useful at all.  
---
Karmic Enrichment: +15% karma gained (not from consumable as far as I know) this is worth notice if you're using a lot of karma, otherwise you may want something else.
---
WxP Enrichment: +10% WvW experience, if you want to level fast you WvW rank, this is a must have.
---
WvW reward track Enrichment: +5% WvW reward track, it's a little low...a tier 6 gives you 195 reward track points, this bring little over 200 every 5 minutes, and you get a reward every 500 points...decide yourself if it's worth.
---
Koda's Warm Enrichment: +15% karma, af for the absic one, maybe not the best, it gives you a flame effect on your torso like the warm effect when you're near braziers in Bitterfrost Frontier, but obtaining it is VERY expensive...if you're not interested in fashion, just ignore this one.
---
By my personal experience, the extra Magic find is maybe the less wortless if you're not a WvW player...and even in that case you may debate on wich is better, more loot or more WxP? \^\_\^

I’m a mirage main. These are not exactly fair points especially when it comes to the weapon skills... There are worse mirage builds to complain about. (Chaos). The weapons and this build in specific is not one of them. I’m contemplating going through each point but that sounds exhausting. 
---
Sorry. :-(
---
Regarding fractals: am I right to assume that while ~~Fire Brigade~~ Firebrand/Renegade is better for full DPS groups, groups that want a healer are better off with the old Druid/Chrono duo? 
---
I notice that while Firebrand/Renegade can heal, they rely much more on decent, static positioning whereas Druid has a very large range for its heals, meaning that while FB/Ren have higher healing output, it's much easier to heal if people decide to move a lot, and they often do especially in 99cm. 
---
No, Quadim!
---
&gt; dragon watch
---
afaik this wasnt even discussed until eirs wake? funeral? anyways it was not talked about or brought up until season 3 that started well after Hot ended.
---
Yooo, imagine killing a high-rank WvW player, or a commander with a full squad, awarded a champ bag! It'd probably be gamed really easy, though...
---
Have to say this 100%. I've tried other races, other classes, but could never leave my Sylvari Ele.

You can disable them by turning off the new player setting.  I can't remember what it's called exactly but it stops random "do x / y" notes for brand new players.

But you only see it after he switched AND wrote something in chat afterwards. That is the point where the person is already back in the instance..
---
Learn mirage, on the fights that favour condi, Mirage is above and beyond the best pick (except Dhuum where Renegade is better, but Mirage still a solid pick).  Power holo is in a solid spot right now.  Not the best dps, but still good.
---
My only other favorite is my asura Mesmer.
---
Depending on what you have unlocked, there are [other ways than Laurels.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ascended_trinket#Amulets)
---
plus it makes more sense that a krewe of asura can come with all the shit that taimi does by herself in such small time frames.
---
There's also the theory that Kralk's eye(s) literally let it see the future, and so in destroying them we're able to level the playing field... a teeny bit.
---
Only if I can take a side trip to have a one on one convo with past me. Have some investment ideas to pass along. Also some medical advice about not waiting to get that rash, I mean, er, that um.... thing checked out. 
---
50 Superior Sigils of Mischief is probably worse than the drinks in all honesty.
---
Chrono is still strong, it's just no longer godlike. SoI still adds on to boons without any downside. It's worth taking. 
---
Staff remains a very defensive weapon more than anything else. It's amazing in PvP if you ever try it. What tier of fractal did you mean?
---
that sylvari are dragon minions 
---
Drove the Quaggon, Krait and Karka from their home, and is in a full blown battle with the Largos. Who knows what other horrors it might stir up
---
It's not even about that, it's about how the 'corruption' was given.. through asking, just as Jormag does. We are still uncertain as to why Sylvari can be corrupted by Aurene, Taimi even speculates it's because of Mordremoth's influence being absorbed
---
have you ever heard of a dragon minion dying of a terminal disease. Not saying its a sure fire thing but there could be something there.
---
Isn't Primordus in the "create" (along with Mordremoth and presumably Bubbles) category of minions and not the "corrupt" (Zhaitan, Kralk, Jormag) one?
---
Considering GW2's premise is about the world's struggle with the Elder Dragons, pretty sure we'll still be dealing with the ED's. We might, however, deal with them creatively like in Path of Fire
---
What order should I unlock upgrades and such from gem store? I already have HoT, PoF and LWS (not sure if I have all of 4 because I'm still new but I don't see LWS S4 anywhere in the store (nor individual episodes).
---
&gt; a boon specially created for chronomancer
---
Shouldn't be a thing in the first place.
---
&gt; guess you dont mind throwing around wells that have nobody standing in them
---
You're either playing with the wrong people or are poorly positioning your own wells.
---
&gt; fb does one button press and grants quickness like its nothing
---
It's almost like chrono doesn't do this either.
---
&gt; a class that was fun and challenging to play when it came out got dumbed down so much that a monkey could play it
---
Really? Last I checked, it was easy enough for a "monkey" to play it BEFORE the nerfs...and now those same people struggle to upkeep buffs, while decent players can outdps shitty dps players WHILE providing/upkeeping boons.
---
&gt; my bad for starting this. wrong place for discussions like this.
---
Yes, it is your bad. You are not here to discuss something...you're here to whine illogically because a class you favour has been justly nerfed.
---
The reality of the matter is that it NEEDS MORE nerfs with NO off-set buffs.
---
I absolutely loved this! It actually made me shed a tear. Thank you for sharing with us! 
---
As much as I hate to say it because I love staff mesmer, it will never be a great weapon choice in fractals which heavily favors burst damage. You can for sure get away with it in t1 and t2, but beyond that it's pretty lacking in the damage that most groups prefer to have.
---
That there is a 5th "Legion" of free Charr
---
We are forced to desecrate her to forge THE weapon to finish off ol'Kralkyboi, but in turn destroys or image towards everyone else. Saved the world, but lost everything for it.
---
&gt; It's a tank and a support class.
---
It also has the highest benchmark in the game currently.
---
If I remember correctly "Lazarus" being Balthazar was one.
---
I use scourge MM for open world with bone minions, blood minion, and the rest corruption. You do way more condi dps with plenty sustain.
---
Definitely not in Minstrel's gear
---
Just an FYI also. Mesmer is the most boring and mind numbing class to level. It only really starts to become what it is capable of later on. Just in case you ever want to try it again! 
---
Got a power holo engineer with max AR Acended gear
---
But ive heard somewhere a raider both needs a power build and a Condition build, I thought why not go a condition engineer? 
---
I have so much experience playing engineer it should be easy... xd
---
I once did a raid training group and we destroyed the first raid, Conjured Amalgamate but got stuck and barely won the time gated Twin Largos (Didnt had a condition character yet) and didnt know you needed one for that raid.
---
But is it save to go mirage route for condition? With anet going on a mesmer nerfing spree?
---
Looking mostly for the class which I can use to fulfill the condition mark, hoped engineer would do cause I main the class but if another class is stronger and more op in the condition spec then that class will be filled with condition gear so any advice to help me find that class would help!
---
There's no best. Just choose some active server and stay there (or dont, it's really irrelevant, server pride is long gone). Different people have different opinions and there's something for everyone in wvw, regardless of server choice.
---
As frustrated as an officer from the Department of Temporal Investigations in DS9 s5e06.
---
I think it's the "snow" that's so "expensive"; same way Frozen Maw seems to turn into a slideshow once the blizzard starts.
---
I once died to the bunny in the categorized fractal
---
That is awesome
---
It's fine :)
---
To tell you the truth, my canon Commander hasn't yet hit a year in-game, and neither has my Warden. I only completed DA:O last month (I know a lot about Dragon Age but there are some things I haven't been witness to yet in the series since I haven't finished DA2 or DAI). Interestingly, my first character, who originated in a Fallout-themed tabletop game, who was also played in Skyrim, had her experiences in GW2 heavily influence who she is in Skyrim (at the very least, since the tabletop game ended years ago).
---
wrong, shield4 does damage
---
I already do play only one, and it's my Necro. I do have alts, but i get bored or lose interest in them.
---
None of the professions evee interested me in the beginning, started off with Thief then Engie... Never considered necro due to mijions until someone told me that they are not required. Tried it out, felt great, stuck with it to this day.
---
Thank you for the comment! I'm really glad you enjoyed it :)!
---
I regret not showing Chaos because it would have highlighted the CURRENT issue with sustain mirage on Sage. But it wasn't intended to be structured.
---
Definitely the best city.
---
Wow, thank you everyone!  I've never heard of gw2hook, and the mistlock and makeover options sound great too!
---
I see you are a man of culture as well!

Oh goodie! Once I kill them I can farm their corpses for the new map currency!

Why does almost every new thread in this sub have 0 upvotes? Is there a bot going around and downvoting ?

Thunderhead actually makes my Graphics card work (NVIDIA GTX 1080). The intense effects like the lightning, snow and shadows are all very GPU heavy. Turn down some graphics settings if it's giving you grief. 
---
T4. Thanks! It's ok, I'll drop staff and/or start playing Druid to use my nevermore. 
---
Bcs I had to add a lot of information and details that I forgot
---
Gotcha, thanks for taking the time to tell me.
---
it's not even hard, just time investing.
---
i mean, i wasnt even into raids the first year, got a new guild after a while wich introduced me into them and in a little bit of time i got my first one.
---
i'm not even a very good player, but i know how raids works now and that was enough to get all 3 armors little by little [i'm 49li away from the title right now]
---
That Alliances wont be ready in 2 months (or ever)
---
I absolutely don't disagree about the scope in question, but to be completely honest I was just making a joke-by-exaggeration.
---
fwiw I'm pretty sure that all the Soundless ended up instantly corrupted once Mordremoth really got going.
---
Yup.
---
Basically a corrupted (rather than manufactured) destroyer that was corrupted while it was pregnant.
---
Lays destroyer eggs that hatch destroyer crabs and crablings.
---
Something few theories seem to touch on is the consumption of Zhaitan and Mordremoth energy (mostly from Mordremoth) which gives even more ways to bring her back (Zhaitan's control of undeath, Mordremoth's regenerative powers). At this point, it seems weird how we would NOT bring her back. They've literally written in EVERY way to bring her back that the universe contains. Zombie, Regeneration, Lich, Ascension, Power of LOVE. So unless we're going to have a depressing episode of us going through every theory and debunking them, I don't see how we get through this without her coming back. Particularly since Ogden refers to the Lich's death as a sign. I would guess we start off next episode with Ogden being all "why are you so sad? She's a lich, just give her a bit."
---
I think your general theory is likely something like what we'll do. Aurene saw herself in that pose with the crystals through her. We assume that means that we fail and she dies when really it means she has to "die" to complete her role in the prophecy.
---
I hope people don't down vote because you deleted the old thread and reposted with new info. The rates and samples do look good, seems like a cool service for some people
---
Actually no people thought it was Lazarus right up until the season 3 episode 5 trailer and that was just because Kasmeer fell to her knees.
---
My human mesmer is designed just like my first GW1 character and I couldn't leave her! 
---
The single unchanging timeline is my favourite version of time travel, simply because you're still heavily constrained by the past. You cannot change things that have already happened, only possibly learn new things due to the different perspective. 
---
Oh the good old taimi ex-machina, we all love it, don't we
---
Ah, okay. But to be fair, you see these "Malyck when" comments all the time on most threads. And I think people tend to overblow the significance/amount of story they actually devoted to him.
---
I seem to remember something about the Soundless that kind of goes with what you're saying, that they were vulnerable to Mordremoth but that not all of them succumbed. My personal headcanon is that their isolation also trained them to see voices in their heads as foreign/wrong and so at least some could have a protection against Mind Daddy.

An older intel cpu will work better with a newer one, remember that gw2 is the worst optimised mmorpg out there

I would go for the highest single core clock speed cpu.  Pretty sure the 8700k is the winner there.  I've heard the new nvme SSDs are so fast your game loads before the server updates.
---
^ this.  The class is just designed to be OP. Mirage cloak is insanely strong and the Mesmer phantasm/clone rework was a huge buff.  I’ve seen mirages stay alive in team fights at like 10% health for ages just due to all of the amazing defenses/utility they have.  The level of sustain is ridiculous and you’re right, the issue is being unable to apply pressure while they apply pressure to you
---
Ah I see, you just have to trust that the other party will give you back the legendary. It's too risky for me. Plus you still have to get a ton of account bound materials that I already struggle to get enough of. Thanks for the explanation.
---
Anyone know what the ghost event is about inside the dwarven catacomb in thunderhead peak? It lasts like 30 min.
---
Probably because it's cut from multiple chapters and we've seen what happens so we're invested more in these scenes. Comparing it to trailers isn't really fair but ok... 
---
The most foul, cruel, and bad-tempered rodent you ever set eyes on, I'm sure!
---
Druid is not the best healer lol.   Other classes such as firebrand, scourge, and renegade are much better healers.  
---
Druids are primarily bought because of spirits, which are unique to that class (much like banners), on top of having the ability to do sustained healing.   
---
It's so... Sciency
---
He was a Necro in the Bonus Mission Pack but a Ele in EoTN. However I believe he didn't use any fire attacks, only lightning based skills.
---
It's not that important to back it up.  Support can remove the 2FA if you can prove the account is yours.  I had them remove it when I switched phones but forgot to transfer the 2FA.
---
outside of WvW, karma is the most valueable one for general use.
---
- gold from monsters: the most insignificant source of income
---
- XP: the effects is very insignificant in light of how many other stackable and affordable sources we have
---
- MF: same as with XP
---
- karma: it might not make you the richest person in the game, but there are enough items that are hard locked behind significant amounts of it, and if you run out, it takes a while to farm any relevant amount again. the stackable boosts are quite limited compared to XP and MF, and event farms outside of WvW usually get hit by diminishing returns quite quickly.
---
IM NEW WHY DID I CLICK THIS THREAD 
---
So how do I progress further in this game if I have the exotic gear? What is the open End of the game? In Diablo, its the paragonlevel, and the gear that always can be a tad better,since finding the perfect gear is quite hard to find/craft.
---
"GW2 tribute spoilers" blurred bright blue video... gee i wonder what could have happened in the new episode XD
---
I was going through a story mission, "pets and walls make stronger kraals", when a crystal like dragon randomly started appearing and disappearing in the sky. Will pop out of thin air, roar, then fly away. Is this normal? Is there something I'm missing? I would post an image but not sure how to link from phone.
---
I mean while that may be true, it would be of lesser quality. But hey, some people enjoy the lesser quality stuff in life. 
---
Oh. Lol my memory is a little off.  It's been like 11 or so years since I've played that quest.  That's impressive that you remember though.
---
You don't need a Z-series mainboard for that CPU. You can't overclock it anyway, why pay more for features that you can't use? Or do you plan to upgrade the CPU later? If not, consider the B360 board and going for the 8600 with the saved money.
---
Default supported RAM speed for the i5-8000s is 2666 MHz. Going for 2133 MHz will effect your performance, especially in a CPU intensive game like GW2 and on a non-oc board. And if you choose 8GB at least go for 2x4GB for dual channel mode. 8GB is enough for GW2, but 16GB is pretty much standard nowadays for modern games.
---
that spec should be all about spirits 
---
Yeah, it's normal. That's Kralkatorik's minion, the shatterer. You can fight him in the [Slay the Shatterer event](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Slay_the_Shatterer) but in the personal story he's just a cameo. 
---
They're pretty lackluster but if you enjoy doing them, do them while the desert highlands [tracker](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Event_timers) says "buried treasure". 
---
Lesser quality? Turn your personal graphics to max, go somewhere remote to fight or ride your mount or strike a pose, etc, use Ctrl+Shift+H to hide your UI, angle your camera, take as many "photos" as you want, on any character you want, wherever you want, whenever you want..for free!
---
But hey, some people enjoy throwing their gold away for easily-emulated results in life.
---
Can you elaborate a little more on leveling so fast? I started 4 days ago and im at about 20 hours played, and im only level 34
---
Another item I'd get after the copper fed that others have mentioned is the Mistlock Sanctuary passkey. I use that almost as much and it's really convenient to be able to hop into fractals/trade post/crafting/bank/even just a safe spot to afk from anywhere and return to your exit point. 
---
Honestly, if you haven't played it, it's fairly unexpected. 
---
It was overtuned at release, but now it's a very fair class. It cannot function on its own and you can easily avoid the majority of it's damage by not being in the well defined "danger" zones. Easily kited and is basically a free kill if found alone.
---
Condimirage? "cancer" is what I see.
---
I disagree but I still +1 because I respect your opinion!
---
You *can* run power pretty much everywhere. But a *good* raider will have both a condi build and a power build.
---
Condi holo supposedly is easier to learn than Condi core engi. Is suggest starting with that, even more so considering that with a much lower ramp time compared to core, its more applicable in more situations.
---
Any raid boss that favours Condi, any Condi class is acceptable. The problem is that mirage excels on every boss that favours condi (minus dhuum where renegade is the top but power and Condi are pretty equal there otherwise) so a lot will tell you to roll mirage. 
---
But imho you'll do better on a class you enjoy that benchmarks less, than one you hate that benchmarks more. 
---
My current 2FA is sms based 2FA. I know this is not state of the art 2FA anymore. Is it possible to set up 2FA similar to discord's?
---
Now it is possible to run any fractal comp without any healing at all. Diviner’s gear allows FB, Ren, and Chrono to maximize DPS while still providing booms. 
---
FB and Ren can both heal if they want, it just depends on how you want to run things. 
---
The important thing for 99cm is to stay stacked on the boss, know when the next phase is and position accordingly, and dodge the big attacks. No comp works if players run from the heals and Boone. 
---
Maul is probably the best looking ranger skill. 
---
Great, then this is the service for you to throw your money away on! But the alternative stands, use Print Screen. Ta-da!
---
And that pic barely looks edited that was submitted in the topic header. It looks like a standard screenshot. And if you want to do touch-ups, there are a lot of free alternatives to Photoshop, but w/e, you've already admitted to wanting to toss your gold away, so that's a moot point to you.
---
But hey you can also stop responding at any point, but won't. Instead, you'll get needlessly aggressive and petty until you feel like you've "won" a pointless argument. Fact is, you can opt to use print screen. My point was made, you can continue if you want though kiddo
---
There are some power traders on there that have done dozens if not 100s of these traders and are very trust worthy. Most of the ones I have dealt with have sent the materials to craft the legendary first, then i build it and mail it back to them, and then they pay the gold. They take a big risk first. Anyway if you aren't comfortable, that is totally up to you.
---
He can't be a man. Bookahs don't understand genius architecture like ours. If he likes he's an asura. No other explanation. I've checked thousands theories to be sure.
---
Why thanks, kind person the world needs more of!
---
Realistically, 3...but, since underwater content is not a thing to ANet any more, 1 - greatsword.
---
Greatsword and all underwater weapons (But I guess there wont be any gen2 water legies) 
---
You mean with authenticator apps? Then yes and it is also more safe
---
I can guarantee who will get the plate drop every time.
---
It's whoever last entered the room before the kill happens, if they interacted with the graveling/tomb or not, and if they stay around they will keep on getting the drop until someone else enters.
---
Pretty much the only way for someone already in the room to get the drop is for everyone who came in after them to get their drop and leave.
---
Next time you're in there just watch. See new people run in as you're fighting and watch their backs as the last person picks up the plate. If they stay and help, no one new will get a plate. Super easy to grief, very hard to get the plate if you miss 'your' drop and there are a lot of people coming in all the time.
---
Asura's rule the world 💜
---
I like your thoughts.
---
I kinda assume that the whole joko situation is going to have a more meaningful stuff tied to it. Aurene established a connection between herself and caithe through 'branding'. This was maybe possible because caithe is originally mordy minion and Aurene absorbed some of his power.
---
Now, Joko was kinda powerful death magic- lich -necromancer being. Kralk possibly absorbed some of zhaitan's power. In the story it was mentioned that there was a sudden surge of zhaitan's power within kralkatorrik. Could it be Aurene 'establishing' a link between her and kralkatorrik, or maybe just the magics colliding and doing the thing? Either way I'm assuming this will bear some significant meaning in future.
---
Aurene's/glint's visions. It's revealed that glint herself couldn't see past the encounter with kralkatorrik, but she's still 'alive' in the mists, not absorbed by Kralkatorrik. Is it possible that the vision is limited to the 'real' word and seeing in to the mists is impossible? Aurene only saw that her death is the only way to 'win' the fight. Possibly the futures she saw before the trials lacked some important bit which is why she couldn't really react to the situation? After the trials she was much more prepared for the fight. She was able to do the branding tricks. Possibly she knew that revealing the full plan would have failed the whole situation because scion couldn't let Aurene kill herself?
---
Just some random thoughts
---
&gt; So yes, a simple: “I have asked them, and they said they were fine with it” would be nice to see here. 
---
Yes, that'd be enough. But, by looking at time of OP's next post (at lest one was written by OP after mine) I do not think it happened... sigh.
---
Getting the prettiest gear requires a lot of time.  Having an effective character is only a function of leaning how to use the skills and game mechanics. 
---
The beautiful thing about Guildwars 2 is that you can take a very long break, come back, and have gear that is still relevant. 
---
There is no gear grind in Guildwars. If you find yourself playing more it’s usually just to earn that beautiful new armor skin that you want.
---
I play in a successful raiding guild here and we only go on weekends.
---
You might find yourself creating all kinds of characters and gear just because you can and don’t have to keep a grind up for them to be relevant. 
---
The lack of a gear grind is absolutely a core reason for why I am a six+ years customer of anet. 
---
Hello  
---
Specializations &amp; elites need to be unlocked by spending hero points which you can earn through various methods (check wiki).  
---
I'd suggest levelling normally for your first character so you get familiar with how levelling &amp; unlocking stuff works :) .
---
Also, 9 Specializations are unique to HoT while 9 others are unique to PoF.
---
It's a bit of both. Like a university city, full of higher educational faculties, laboratories, students, workplaces a few leisure facilities, quiet (or not so quiet) homes, trade and some production. Major industry may happen in the depths of that cube. There's lots of space left inaccessible. I mean what exactly are the golem mines?
---
The thing is even with an entire crew it's still bad writing.
---
There's never any tension when you can resolve practically everything with "And then the asura/wizard pulled a whatchacallit out of their asses and used the kajigger to save the day."
---
I assume you've heard of Sanderson's laws of magic? Guild wars breaks all of them.
---
Sanderson’s First Law says that "An author’s ability to solve conflict with magic (or tech/magictech) is DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL to how well the reader understands said magic. (or tech/magitech)", aka "The better the reader understands a magic system, the more it can be used to resolve conflict."
---
The point of the rule is to make magic/technology feel fair instead of just being a copout all purpose cavity plot insulation spray. 
---
Try applying this rule to both asura magictech and magic in the world of tyria in general. It has no limits or rules. When the characters are backed into a corner nobody every thinks "How will they make clever use of the established rules to get out of it." 
---
We're just expecting the next never heard of before deus ex machina to descend from the sky and solve the problem for us. (COUGH COUGH FLASHPOING COUGH COUGH). 
---
The Second Law is that Limitations are more important than Powers. This means that powers don't make a story interesting; what matters is what they can't do.
---
Can you imagine litterally anything at this point that's out of the character's reach? What limitations are there in regards to what asura or magic can and can't do? They say "The sky's the limit!" well in this case bad writing is the limit. Litterally all problems at this point can be solved with a previously unexplained kajigger.
---
And the final law, tells writers to expand what you already have before you add something new. To do this, there are three directions a writer can take: Extrapolate, Interconnect, or Streamline.
---
Yeah, considering the ammount of asspulls the gw2 setting has, I don't even need to explain this one.
---
Honestly, in my opinion asura and such incredibly soft magic were a mistake. The writers became too complacent and made the entire story rely on magical and technological asspulls that are so far removed from the ground guild wars is practically a parody of itself.
---
I used this before, but for some reason it doesn't seem to work, it's either everything or nothing with the green screen or let it be any color, only UI is visible, no matter how I change the settings. It worked so fine like a year ago for me, then later after some patch I turned it on and bam it was ruined.
---
There are no new under water legendaries coming.
---
Elite specs can’t be unlocked by just using the level 80 boost, you have to unlock them by getting hero points. Expansion maps give you 10 HPs per hero challenge, you can also unlock them with WvW currency. You have them all unlocked in Pvp right away, if you own the respective Expansions, so you can preview them there.
---
This is the only map in the game I have to change graphics settings for.  Even at "lowest" I can't consistently get 60fps out of a GTX 1060.  Nothing else in the game kicks my rig in the groan area this hard - not Mistlock with its dozens of infusions, not LA, not even Istan or Silverwastes.
---
There's no way to turn the snow off, either.  Set every option to "low" or "off" and it's still there.  It runs smoother but you can't get rid of it.
---
The Book Club. A powerful weapon made by a Librarian, who finally snapped. Stats should be selectable.
---
its pretty obvious that all you want is someone to go on a rant against mate and since as i already stated this aint the place for it xD but thx for your interesting input anyway. ill try to use my newly aquired knowledge to the best of my ability.

It was showing them current locations however not glimpses of the past.

Kralk is her dad and Glint is her mum.

I had rubberbanding in THK and was wondering if it was an intentional effect implemented as a nod to GW1

Wing 6 of forsaken thicket?

As a player who only dips into wvw for the gift of battle, I feel personally attacked. 
---
:( 
---
It's been nowhere *near* 10 years.
---
Shh... Close enough...
---
Is there any form of 2v2 or 3v3 one life deathmatches/arenas? I saw some 5v5 objective type modes, but all with respawns thus far.
---
definitely not a common problem
---
are you sure you didn't log in to a new account?
---
I like the weapon idea, but how do we kill Kralk without destroying all of reality?  That seems like the real issue now.
---
The Deus Ex Machina route.
---
We'll discover a special magical leyline fountain under Lion's Arch that can help us remove all the energies Kralkatorrik has, or we can use it to free Aurene and give her unimaginable superpowers. In the end, we discover an even bigger fountain in Caithe's home, which we can swap Kralkatorrik and Aurene's bodies. Aurene becomes an Elder Dragon, and Kralk is trapped in his own crystals.
---
Also, Archon Iberu comes back again for no reason.

The serial number is just an additional piece of proof to determine if you own the account. They won't delete your characters because you couldn't find it. If you've already got access then it isn't that.
---
You sure you've got the right account email address? You didn't make a beta test account on this email and your main account is on another email?
---
If you're certain this is the correct account then somebody has deleted your characters. Hacked maybe? Pissed off friend or family who also had access? You can try asking for a character restoration but no idea if it'll work if they were deleted a long time ago.
---
Didnt think about that...might have used my Yahoo account way back in 2005 when I started the original GW :)
---
Well I got the Two the Barricades achievement this evening, but the Pepperseed escort bugged and only dropped 7 packages, not the required 8
---
I think it happens around 30 minutes before the daily reset. The ghosts stop people wasting their time gated deldrimor key. (Gates change daily)
---
Healscourge is only strong on encounters without hard dps and mechanic checks. Its why Im really quite mixed about it. Essentially the build abuses that most raid encounters are quite lenient in that way to cater to casuals. Doesnt matter if you need 10 minutes to kill VG because boons are missing and everyone gets ported every 9 seconds and/or die to cleave... with healscourge you can still carry it to the end because the enrage mechanic and enrage timer are way too lenient.
---
While its nice to show new players the bosses first time, real training should be done without and instead used something like support firebrand that still carries by a LOT, but is more about promoting dps as well as keeping players alive.
---
it is for sure a flying Pearl and a rly unquie City
---
You don't need both and you can take power dps to bosses like Mathias and Largos if you want but won't perform as well as condi. Get gear for a condi class and learn its build for encounters where it's more favourable. Condi engi could be good if you're comfortable with engi but other options include condi daredevil, mirage, scourge, banner slave berserker. I think where condi excels is when the boss hasn't got any invulnerability phases. Bosses with phases usually go invulnerable and your condi ticks do not do anything and you may have to reapply condis and some builds take time for the conditions to ramp up.

WP had an entire video after the release of episode 4 and he discussed all posibilities for like 20 minutes. Balthazar was the very last he mentioned, and I think it was more as an easter egg. Really showing how much of a fringe theory it was... but it was still out there! Very cool reveal it was back then, especially since people wanted the gods back for so long!
---
hey if you want somethig, you like you gotta work for it
---
I love the way the picture looks, but I especially like how the charr itself looks.  No cancerous glowing animations or dumb/overused "super saiyan" hairstyle.  No stupid lion face like nearly every charr pc I see in game.  Your art looks menacing and ferocious as a charr should.
---
Who E is.....
---
oh wait, nevermind.
---
The thumnail makes Kralkatorrik look like he's wearing a monocle and has a monopoly man moustache.
---
You need to purchase Path of Fire, and once you have a level 80 toon, start the beginning quests in that xpac to obtain your first mount. Each proceeding mount requires completion of a heart and some gold. Griffon is the most expensive at a whopping 250g, as well as a series of collections to complete. Roller Beetle comes with Episode 3 of Living World Season 4: Long Live the Lich. That one also requires a series of collections but isn't nearly as expensive as the Griffon.
---
I mean, I like the look and feel of it. I just want.. *more* of it. Housing facilities, basic Asuran technical component production machines, repair and tinkering workshops, markets, a sciency flea-market-affair where young and old can sell, gift and share their personal minor projects, a mensa-like establishment (university restaurant type thing) things like that. It just doesn't feel fleshed-out enough to be a city.
---

---
That's a really good one, probably one of my favourites. 
---
Charr probably got all remaining horses in the Fields of Ruin treaties.
---
I remember some VERY old discussions I had in GW1 / early GW2  about Chars that got left behind / didn't want to return post-Orr. That's all I have.
---
Personally I never really connected with the Aurene character.  A lot of the Aurene storylines were very inconsistent.  I get the feeling that the GW2 writers had differing ideas on what they wanted to do with the character.  
---
From a story perspective, I think it’s time to wrap up the dragons storyline and move on to the next big thing.  If it was me writing the story, I’d use Aurene’s death as a literary catalyst that ultimately results in the defeat of the Elder Dragons.  Personally I like the idea of the Tyrian gods making an overly dramatic return to Tyria to “end the madness once and for all”.  I’ve got this picture in my head of Grenth, Lyssa and co. plunging Kralk into a continent sized black hole.  
---
The trick to a good “prophecy storyline” is to make the prophecy not what the audience expects.  The audience are led to believe that Glint is the chosen one that will defeat the Elder Dragons (i.e. the dragon messiah).  It would be a very interesting plot twist if Aurene was supposed to die all along (i.e. not the dragon messiah).  Perhaps out of all of the possible futures Glint foresaw, the only ones where the Elder Dragons are defeated are the ones where Aurene dies.  
---
Best thing to do is just go for a server that has a nice population and activity in wvw... Piken Square, desolation and whiteside ridge are good choices.
---
This is if you don't know anyone playing the game that you could join with.
---
You can always switch at some point by paying gems.
---
You could also just first check for a guild of fun people and see what server they're on. 
---
If your masteries are maxed, you can get spirit shards quickly by leveling up.  I tend to use the +exp because you get spirit shards really quick. 
---
It all really depends on what you need... I like to have spirit shards cause I go through them a lot. If you lack karma then take that. Magic find is alright it really wont change your drops much if at all. I think the other ones are pretty worthless 
---
Mounts are locked to Path of Fire.
---
You can't use them until you've unlocked them in the PoF content, after which they become account-wide unlocks.
---
The first mount is the Raptor and it unlocks after finishing the first PoF mission.
---
You can use the instant 80 boost that comes with PoF to hit the level cap and run the mission/sit in a corner while someone runs it for you (because spoilers) to unlock the raptor for quick use.
---
And finally - don't delete that old character whatever you do. It'll be receiving the high-end birthday rewards so keeping it around is a good idea.
---
do you have 5 or 2 free character slots? If you only have two, you created a new f2p account and didnt log into your old account
---
Ouch. I think happened to me the first time. 
---
or they surprise us with only one greatsword that has different skins at day and night
---
Also check Dulfy for the Griffon collection! The guide there should help you when you get to those points in the game :)
---
One more thing, since you missed the most of the season (we just launched episode 5 of season 4, out of 6), you'll need to purchase those episodes to play them, including any other seasons (so 2 and 3 as well, but 2 is before Heart of Thorns, and 3 is between HoT and PoF).
---
looks under-powered
---
Personally I don't care much for screen shots, but after looking at some of what he does and what he charges it doesn't seem so bad (fake internet money for screenshots is a fair trade).
---
If this was some scrub-a-dub-dumbass whose rates were stupid and work was really crap I'd be the first to start shitting on it :).
---
I like the creative way of earning gold so I'm all for it.
---
I sent a request into GW2 support to see if there is an account with my old yahoo address.  I hope so, I really would like those old characters back.  Plus the birthday presents!
---
Original account info from GW was found in yahoo account so I think that may be it.  It said my gw account was using an @plaync account.  I think that was before they required an email.
---
I’m looking to actually level through the game naturally instead of using any if these birthday scrolls. So no mounts till 80 huh?
---
I had 5 free slots.  Probably not my original account then huh?
---
I just realized... wtf are these boots?
---
Funny you bring this up, cuz that's what a lot of people would say about modern photographers, since everyone owns a phone with a camera now ideas.
---
Here's the thing: everyone can click a device. But creating the compositions in terms of placement, backgrounds, colours etc. that stuff requires skill, and that's why photography as a profession will never go extinct.
---
Seeing his portfolio got me really impressed, and seeing the kind of pictures/screenshots I have of my characters I am certain he will give me something much more memorable than I currently own.
---
Its really not that bad. Tyria was originally designed without mounts in mind, so the zones are appropriately sized and loaded to the brim with content. Even though I've had mounts unlocked for a while, I still find myself running around on alts when doing content because you don't feel compelled to be maxing move speed all the time to zoom past landscape voids or filler.
---
Enjoy? You monster
---
Now I need to go find my kleenex and cry
---
The ~~Pen~~ Book is mighter than the ~~Sword~~ Mace.
---
Asura masterrace.  
---
And for the profession... probably Revenant i dont know. I'm stuck between being useful and having actually fun.
---
heeeey that's pretty cool actually !!! I'd love that to happen !
---
I've deceded to go for the dungeneering achievement, what would be a good class/build for speedy daily dungeons? I was thinking hybrid boon chrono?
---
That's correct, and as /u/Thaurlach mentioned, if you want the best experience to story, play through it normally and get all the content you're able (season 2, HoT, season 3, PoF, season 4) till you're able to get your first mount.
---
Getting to 80 is easy. If you have birthday boosters, which I'm assuming you should because of all the anniversaries you're account has had. Slap one on and complete tons of maps. Doing Personal Story will help as well but you'll get a ton of stuff through completing maps.
---
Thanks, i figured that out as well.
---
Still missing my old Book-Club Warband though and wish they were here to share that treasure.
---
[leaked concept art](https://imgur.com/phNpkzR)
---
no, then its definately a paid account
---
I want to see a DPS chart for each class soloing a keep door. 
---
&gt;In our tests, Berserker topped the charts at 12 DPS when using Sweet and Spicy Butternut Squash Soup with Scholar runes.
---
I'm not a fan of her either, but you raise a valid point. Despite the poor character development I only see her as a lazy way to relay info to the player and get the player to areas where the next chapter is to take place. 
---
We directly alter history with the Ancestor tree bubble however, Freeing the one Djinn (who later gets branded, the other Djinn comments it's odd how he got free from the bottle because a Djinn cannot free themselves from a bottle), later giving a suit of armor to a civilian there with his blessing. The armor then becomes more powerful and we take pieces we recover to the original armorsmith, and then the priory to clean up.
---
That's how we get the Requiem armor. 
---
You absolutely want 16 GB of RAM.  It is amazing the amount of performance jump you see in games when you have enough RAM available to run them without having to worry about system overhead and the game.  
---
For a second I thought the guy actually had that written on a back window and that was a lot more amusing :&gt;
---
Holy crap, dude! Thank you SO GOD DAMN MUCH! I have close to 1 million faction and had zero clue what to do with it....
---
Why not play unranked? The rewards are the same in off-season, aren't they? 
---
ante: sorry dawg, that’s too hard
---
*"Remember Ascalon!"*
---
whats the reference?
---
Use reshade.
---
Correct, falcon Au ute.
---
Yes, you can tell me your idea and i'll come up with the execution of it, i'll show you some locations that we can go and poses that you can do... all that, everything included xD
---
/u/Jawgeous , I literally brought some cake and coke to enjoy your rant.
---
It is haha, he has a sticker 
---
She's not done yet. &lt;3
---
That arenanet will introduce nothing for PvP. 
---
Edit= that is a real sticker on his window haha. Not Photoshop.  
---
I mean they only put out a big trailer from the last episode saying what happens in this one basically, it's entirely expected? 
---
With this logic, revenant should also overperform at all times. Which it hasn't.
---
I'm not disagreeing with you that a crew makes more sense than 1 prodigy, I'm just saying that in the grand sceme of things both are very bad and lazy writing.
---
Wait a minute...I think I am very confused after so long away.  Were you even able to bring original GW characters into GW2. Starting to think I never played much GW2...might have all been the expansions to GW.
---
Does anyone remember the GW to GW2 migration process?
---
I like how it looks like a bunch of men are reaching up to gently touch him.  &lt;3
---
&gt;
---
&gt;\- Do either the druid spec or DH play similar to a priest in WoW? I always liked running dungeons as support / healer but also providing DPS. 
---
I used to run Zealots druid back in HoT. It was really fun and did a lot of healing while also doing pretty decent dps
---
At least being a main gemstore item means it's not in a RNG box where you could spend thousands of gems buying keys and not getting it?  :D
---
(only good side to it, I know, haha)
