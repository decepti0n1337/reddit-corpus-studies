I really like the idea that the already toxic raid community is being even more pathetic and petty. Sorry about your account, still funny though.
---
Tbh if u can find a bundle price or a special sale this game with both expansions is cheap af.  Save up some money and w8 for the next sale when it is announced, the prices are really low for the amount of content and new features  you get. For me gliding and mounts alone are more than enough justification to spend the money.
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Although for a brand new player core game will provide huge amounts of gameplay time, the experience with mounts, gliding and a few other masteries just changes dramatically.
---
Didn't realize you could do that, thank you.
---
Well, you like it, then keep it.
---
I'd rather have the option to remove it altogether.
---
Luckily, the Division 2 has Anthem there to make it look like a fucking shining beacon sent from god, even if it does have quite a bit of issues.
---
Surprised that Xar wasn't in the video

People banned for almost a decade were able to recover their accounts, so yeah, they're never truly deleted.

Because they liked ranger gameplay best I assume? But did not want to be forced into the pet at all times? Why were there thieves that wanted ranged options? Why mesmers, that wanted to be able to deal sustained damage? Why guardians that wanted to be able to support? There were other classes available for this as well.
---
To be quite honest I don't exactly care why they did. Fact is: There were ranger players who wanted this. The devs seem to have liked the idea of a pet-merging class (that doesn't actually get rid of the pet at all to be quite clear), the class is quite strong and overall well liked. Why would they or the devs or I for that matter have to defend this opinion, just because it does not cater to your particular taste?
---
Yeah, i remember spending entire games playing power/shiro rev and just focusing on bullying his power reaper build.
---
I don't think i"ve seen him again since season 7 or 8. Then again, i haven't played much since season 7 either.
---
Pmed
---
I just call them griller since it's just easier than saying grilled cheese sandwich maker.
---
It's annoying, but not really a reason to hate the class. It's a reason to hate on the playerbase tho
---
To the ranch!
---
Brilliant
---
I see your Arc Divider and raise you Endure Pain, Signet of Stone, and literally every other source of damage immunity.
---
Mirage is perfect in every way, you can’t convince me otherwise.
---
Hammer guardian is good with Zeal, Honor, and DH. Just take everything that buffs symbols and slam jam the world.
---
This giveaway is still available.  I just received a code.  I believe it's not guaranteed though. You can get ARP points instead.
---
Having the Griffon available to all your characters makes  levelling incredibly easy but if you don't have the gold to unlock it or the map completion a combination of the Raptor and Bunny serve just as well.

Well Im glad someone could find joy in it! I personally thought season 2 was a god damned travesty, the missions were bland and uninteresting and the story just didnt make any sense. I point to season 2 as what ruined caithe as a character, it made her a complete jackass out of nowhere
---
&gt; "We had to make some adjustments, and really those were about saying, 'You know what? This is an opportunity for us to assess whether we're just doing this because we always have - or because this has been the pattern for the past two seasons - or shall we refresh things a bit and do something a bit different?'
---
&gt; "Our fans have been asking for that - for us to do things a little bit differently and not be formulaic, so we took this as an opportunity to do that, to assess and make the right decisions for the game."
---
Which one of you was the one asking for them to do more Living World seasons instead of a third expansion? I'll fight you!
---
I think when players asked for something they different, they meant Living World season maps (and expansion maps for that matter) that have more robust content, rewards and replay value than the light ones we got with Seasons 3 and 4 (and to some extent, PoF). Is there really a group of players who want ArenaNet to turn their backs on the expansion model every two or three years to do more experiments with Living World as a form of content delivery?
---
These comments really worry me that the place we found ourselves at with HoT's release and pre-PoF (expansions are good for GW2, players want expansions instead of endless Living World seasons) has been forgotten and they've returned to the experimental Living World as primary content (instead of bridging content) that alienated so many players back in 2014.
---
In my opinion ArenaNet righted the ship with the lessons of Heart of Thorns - expansions every two years, deliver elite specs, robust maps, interesting masteries and exciting new destinations in a traditional expansion drop, bridge the time between expansions with Living World. There is room for how many new maps a Season should include or putting another episode on an existing map and building on it (similar to what was done with Silverwastes) but I don't think there was a big demand for Living World as an alternative to expansions.
---
Same, I've seen him two times in the past week. Definitely enjoy hearing him talk in map chat though.
---
How often do they switch out WvW Server links? Still relatively new to GW2
---
Yeah
---
1) Yes it's still possible
---
2) As far as I can remember it was never profitable, it was always (since the wardobe exists) only a cheap way to get the two skins
---
3) You can try [https://www.gw2bltc.com/](https://www.gw2bltc.com/) (but consider that the bought / sold numbers also contain cancelled orders)

Check your sampling setting. Supersampling is a significant drain on the game. If it's there, flip it back to default.  If not, shrug. Maybe try playing with some settings and seeing if there's anything you can edit. I'm not aware of any significant graphics changes in the past year so i'm sorta at a loss as to why this would be causing you issues if it hadn't in the past.
---
I know many GW2 players that openly admit to using RMT to get ecto &amp; stuff to fill their Hall of Monuments that I wouldn't be surprised if this was them finally getting hit for it.
---
What happened to him?
---
Not ranked so idc
---
For PvE the only other person that comes to mind is Giant Pocket Raptor and their meta train guild. They would scream in mapchat of HoT maps while running meta trains and actual command those metas super smooth. Made all those achievements where you needed to do the metas a billion times super easy :p
---
i agree with someone above. shift+1 to shift+5 can be replaced with f1-f5 skills. super useful if you have a large keyboard or not many buttons on your mouse to bind.

I think OP means D9VK.

While I don't know enough about the programming differences to refute your statement, what I do know is sliding the Enable DXVK to active under runner options gave me a huge performance boost over the former. And this was the only configuration change I made.

Using money to purchase "intellectual property" that you do not own, is against the Terms of Service. The IP is owned by ArenaNet and thus is not yours to sell (or to receive for IRL funds). 
---
Buying and/or exchanging currency is not something I would recommend. You'll get yourself banned.

Trading between players is allowed, but ANet will offer no support if you get scammed. Trading for real money is strictly against the ToS and you'll get banned if caught.

I thought its a nonsensical save out-of-nowhere for no reason whatsoever to save the hero and/or continue the swiss cheese plot because reasons.

Game is designed to be materially unrewarding because gem to gold credit card sales from whales with large gold sinks built into the game is what incentivizes their main form of income.

F2P/B2P games will always be like this. They will always have large goldsinks behind RNG/grinds and low rewards with the option to speed up reward acquisition via opening the wallet.

Just did this last night.  Took my wife did it by alternating.  She stayed away from the fight and let me do everything, then she got achieve.   Then we switched roles and she did everything and I got the achieve.

It's simple. Get to that tree in the middle, and it'll bring you to all three lanes. Just.make sure you're on the right level of that tree, or else it'll take you to one of the beaten paths that move between the lanes. Oh, and dont forget those other paths that move between the lanes, and try and remember which ones are up high and which ones are low. Then you also have the parts that run under all the lanes and are filled with water, and a couple places that are straight shots above or through the lanes, and a few holes in the ground that will drop you somewhere that winds around to somewhere way different than you though it would. Also theres the giant waterfall by the entrance, if you jump down there, or won't take you to that other hole about 50 feet away where the Mushroom Emperor is, so make sure you remember that. And also make sure you know how to navigate that final path to reach Dragon's Stand, because there's a couple branches that are super troll (including one that will take you to the Troll), and the Mordrem will fuck you up if you get lost. And then there's that other branch in that path that will bring you to the other HP that's kind of high up, and if you keep following that around for a while you will eventually meet back up around the entrance. And then most pathways in Rata Novus are just giant circles that sometimes trap you in them, except for the one that's actually the Rata Novus lane.

Seriously, if you cant figure that out, I don't know how to help you.

Downvote party for being on BG.

I mean, if judging a spec, and perhaps the players of that spec, because the playerbase as a whole doesn't have a perfect grasp of the game's balance isn't a stupid reason, I have no idea what a stupid reason would be.

That's not a balance issue, that's a community issue.

You've read a handful of complaints out of thousands and thousands of tickets. And even in those threads, people are saying they're helped pretty fast. Too many people get a false sense of what's going on by reading complaint posts. There are always going to be more complaint posts than complimentary posts. People who don't have complaints, don't always have the impetus to post.

I've contacted support successfully a half a dozen times and never once felt the need to post about my experience.

Yeah, dxvk doesn't support dx9. However, that is changing quite soon, another dev is implementing dx9 using the dxvk infrastructure. His project is called d9vk and apparently it became good enough to run GW2 today. See this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/bi5us8/guild_wars_2_now_playable_with_d9vk/

---
Thanks, I don't even like reading through mobile site layouts on my phone.
---
When was the last time you contacted support?
---
Alright...
---
I did play WvW and have play for the start of GW2. Its not the first build that could output burst and still have survivability.
---
But IMO a projectile burst that deal damage over 1.6 to 2.5 seconds wasnt great. Thats plenty to notice the burst and avoid it. On top of that, that use pretty much all your CD so you are useless until you get back your CD. A Deadeye or Warrior build with rifle will be better IMO because you couldnt tell that the burst will come and the burst will not trigger survival traits if you get it down 1 oneshot.
---
Ranger LB didnt have follow up outside of AA too and those LB CD take ages. If you want a range burst build, you are better with a build that could keep pressure even outside of burst.
---
lol
---
Yeah I think I spent the most time on 11.  5,9,11 are my favs as well.
---
Damn that sucks!! I usually go to the light novels but this one was so good animated I've been waiting on it...
---
&gt;  But my point is I shouldn't have even arrived at this point. Two-factor authentication should have been enough... there's a flaw in their security logic that needs to be addressed.
---
You are using a VPN, which is against the ToS and also hampers their ability to verify your log ins. Your own fault.
---
It all depends on what YOU find fun.  I play for fun and not for rewards (except in a few cases).  There is an incredible amount of content in GW2.  You don't have to restrict yourself just to season 4 and HoT meta.
---
Personally, I don't enjoy most of season 4 maps, but I love season 3 maps.  So I do that and much more usually.  I may go back and look at season 4 more later.  For me, all the zerg events (like Istan) turned me off.  But I'll give it chances again, it's just that I'm too busy with other fun content.
---
Don't worry if you don't like one aspect.  Enjoy the rest. :)
---
It's great for Charr because it's one of the few shoulder skins that doesn't friggin' *float* on them.
---
are you f2p? Maybe guilds are limited to 1 for f2p?
---
&gt;  the only reason a GW2 player would ever go back to it is 1. Nostalgia, and 2. AP/Rewards from HoM.
---
I mean, genuinely enjoying GW1 over GW2 doesn't necessarily mean nostalgia. They are completely different games.
---
However, that being said, it still wouldn't really be affected by bots.
---
Innate Daze on Steal is too powerful. 
---
Thief's design is to hit hard and fast, not to disrupt the target and mess with them (That's the Mesmer's archetype) 
---
The only thing that needs to be made baseline is the extra +3 Initiative. 
---
That is, if not the only reason, that people even bother picking Trickery.
---
+3 Ini allows yu to do so much more with Thief to combo skills together or to simply finish up a combo without needing to wait. 
---
The other trait is Lead Attacks, which isn't usually picked for the damage boost, but rather the Steal cooldown reduction.
---
I think Lead Attacks in itself is the single most powerful trait Thieves must pick in order to enable their rotations. 
---
Imo move Lead Attack's damage portion to Critical Strikes to replace Sundering Shade, which totally pales in comparison to Practiced Tolerance. 
---
Preparedness (+3 Ini) should be made baseline and replaced with something in line with Trickery's focus on empowering Tricks and managing Ini.
---
Something like "deal more damage when initiative is more than half" could work pretty well and rewards players who do not spam skills.
---
Are these outfits or did you mix and match transmogs. These are sweet

I made a personal UI redesign project for GW2 that included some UX improvements like that. Should I post it here?

What shoulders are you using in 2nd row, 3rd one from the left?

Chest Krytan jerkin. All the shiny glowy stuff is Foefire.  Its a gemstore skin or you can unlock if you work on wardrobe unlocks.  It's pretty cool its off in the day and the candles turn on at night.
---
Soooooo you're going to be upset and quit the game if they don't have this sorted out for you within a few days. Bye Felicia.
---
I dont think so, I was in 4 guilds and then left 3 of them thinking that would work. The forums on the GW2 site are saying the limit is 5.
---
VPN usage is not against ToS.
---
what uhm... what happened at 7?
---
You must be retarded. His complaint makes just as much sense as yours if you complain about not being able to get a legendary just by doing wvw.
---
This is a game, and you should never be forced into a game mode that you don't like. The game should give you the option to get everything in your own game mode, be it pve pvp or wvw.
---
Go spit your venom somewhere else
---
Unless I'm missing something, bg typically is the server getting farmed (KDR &lt; 1) and yall just stay t1 with ppters that play during all hours of the day.
---
&gt; Unless I'm missing something
---
You're missing something.
---
... do you not know how a VPN works? It most certainly doesn't violate that point. lol
---
Seems to me that it would be easier to get rid of all your "junk" (your word, not mine)  if in fact it is truly "junk".  I helped a friend clean out his personal bank, suggesting he sell things like  insignias/inscriptions that he had been hoarding for a couple years but never used and could buy back from the tp if he every did find a use for them.   He also had numerous stacks of Halloween and Wintersday food that he does not use, so he sold 80% of those.  
---
After we culled a bunch of stuff using this sort of logic, we put some maxed sized bags(at least 20 slot, 32 if you can afford it-they are cheaper than buying a guild bank) on a storage alt and gave him stuff that he does not use regularly but refused to get rid of.  After this was done, he had 3 empty bank tabs.   
---
32 slots bags now seem more useful on storage alts than "main" toons since ANET has updated the loots to drop gear bags everywhere.
---

Oh, man. Ronald McDonald character. I used to play with him before. Long time ago.

---
&gt; Fast forward 2 weeks to tonight... my guild leader just got back from his vacation and was ready to command some WvW action. I go to log in to join him and am met with the "Error code: 45:6:3:2157" error. This is basically the message that says your account has been suspended because it may have been accessed by an unauthorized individual.
---
[Error 45](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/115015910888-Error-Code-45) is given in 4 different circumstances:
---
* The account may have been caught violating the terms of service.
---
* The account may have violated the rules of conduct in the game or on the forum.
---
* The account may have been flagged for using a third-party program to cheat or gain an advantage in the game.
---
* In some cases, the account is banned due to a confirmed hacking attempt. If we detect that your account has been compromised, we will try to ban it as quickly as possible to prevent any tampering with your characters or inventory.
---
My money is on that you got banned for breaking ToS and not because Anet got a false positive about an incident 2 weeks ago and suspended your account for security reasons.
---
What is the backpiece skin on the bottom right?
---
Shoulders, actually.  Exalted shoulders, black lion chest item a couple months ago or so.
---
 https://images.app.goo.gl/YD77d9Ku5PnAaoJc9 Over here.
---
I always think of the guy the "dev" had hi-dive off a ledge in DR and then fully banned the account.
---
That's the best part about Ipos, in my opinion. You can force it to appear while sitting in chairs too, which look really nice as well. It looks especially adorable on cute-themed characters sitting on the basic chair you get for the Armchair Commander achievement, it looks like you're just taking a rest and catching up on some light reading.
---
You sound morbidly obese
---
Anyone know which armor set 4 and 7 are? They look great, makes me wanna reinstall the game and play around
---
Since the last patch they are just broken, but you can expect it to be nerfed soon™.
---
If achievement points motivate you, look into Thunderhead Peaks, specifically the Heroic Dragonsblood weapons.  Each Heroic Dragonsblood weapon collection you complete will give you 12 AP.  12 x 16 = 192 AP, plus an extra 16 points from crafting the basic Dragonsblood weapons, so that's 208 AP just from that part of the map/meta.
---
Or using "harmless bots" that shouldn't be counted as a reason to be banned. Like auto-consuming items whenever their effect is depleted. Think of the ability to auto-consume food/utility in GW2 whenever it expires. Surely that is not grounds to ban, right? /s
---
All separate pieces.  Listed them in this post:  https://www.reddit.com/r/GuildWarsDyeJob/comments/aln3aa/funerary_fab/
---
Berserker is simply just an AoE cleaving monster right now, on the same level of Reaper.
---
Predictable, high damage, and has great survivability.
---
Only difference is that Berserker's Core Warrior traits enable him to back out of fights due to the superior mobility from GS and Warrior's Sprint.
---
If yu fight any decent player though, Berserker is prone to being kited.
---
Yeah, Had my account since like Dec 2005 or January 2006. I have seen many a ban wave over the years. Never been banned. Of course, I never did anything illegal or purchased dubious Items either. Anet has a habit of even banning people who bought duped Items saying if the price was too good you should have known better.
---
Now we have another one api translator :D
---
1) between 46-50 gb if I remember correctly
---
2) 
---
Warrior: melee fighter primarily, heavy armored weapon master
---
Ranger: ranged/melee skirmisher, has an AI pet mechanic
---
Necromancer: mid range damage, summons and controls minions, high life bar and a secondary life bar mechanic
---
If core necro, I suggest some minions and power ham with soul reaping. Tank hard hitting skills with death shroud if you can't dodge in time.
---
If reaper, same as core but u survive better imo cuz your reaper shroud will hit like a truck (coupled with sigil of vampirism, you recover 10% hp per kill). You can also have minions to gain life force even when you're currently in shroud if need more meat shields. 
---
If condi scourge, build something that has healing power that way you get a fatter barrier.
---
That's just ANET's new e-sports strategy. They promote PvP by not letting you leave!
---
His music is not bad but I don't think it's the most amazing thing in the world.  I think some of his soundtracks could really shine if implemented well. Some iconic ones would probably be, The Charr Triumphant and Raven Speaks, from Teq and Jormag respectively.
---
One of my favourite soundtracks from him would have to be [The Seraph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBOv-W_aPjg&amp;list=PL9u7rbRjJmqD_qh-WXX7zSftvxOL5nUhI) where an epic build up could actually be done very well IMO. Although I would have to admit, that this soundtrack matches cinematic style cutscenes or movies rather than ingame encounters. The violins at the start build really good suspense and tension. Then onwards from \~0:37-&gt;1:30 would need to be filled with character voicing and some visuals to keep the suspense. 1:30 again the violins come in would be perfect for something like an elder dragons voice or one of their champions reveal + voice.  
---
As you say, I DO love HoT music more though.
---
Nah, bg KDR is usually greater than 1 because they farm people in off hours with their men, or hug siege and snipe kills when they can't guarantee a pushover.
---
Is it all the same character?
---
You can do the usual and show bigger group HP bars etc so you dont need to watch their HP all the time!
---
Are you running Magi or the Marshal/Shaman Variant?
---
Thanks! Did you see the gw2 cosplay post someone put together a few days ago?  Someone did a pretty great Jack Sparrow and Will Turner.  Gw2 loves it's pirates.
---
I can spot a few problems with your suggestions, for instance /gg isn't really a good idea as it gives players a way to chicken out in order to deny the points their opponents would get from kills. It isn't honorable and it isn't seppuku, simply because you can respawn immediately. It's just an "instant escape" button.
---
Disabling the rally would indeed increase the value of resurrection skills and eliminate the rally race entirely, however it makes possible a scenario which isn't particularly exciting - both sides nuke each other and there are players laying about everywhere, trying to revive themselves or worse - trying to win the fight with downstate dps.
---
Honestly, a week-long event is probably the best way to have this effect (or one of your proposed ones, for that matter), as it only breaks the game temporarily, allowing the players to have fun breaking it.
---
Nope. But I've seen those cosplays been done in the past :)
---
Thaks, bud.
---
Which armor/outfit is third character wearing?
---
Indeed!
---
What, he's gone? But who will be the comedy relief?!?

---
:o thanks!
---
How did you get those outfit?
---
Because everything I see in the store (not the one we pay with gem, but the one we pay players stuffs with normal gold) is excessively ugly and Anet doesn't want to add more "casual" armors... Those are beautiful. I don't have the cash the buy gems, I hope you got them in-game!
---
November was an eventful month.
---
Huh, I never knew! Thank you.
---
All in all I really like this heart. Lots of different things you can do (also betting on the brawls or killing spiders), very atmospheric and it's fast.
---
Thank you :)
---
My point about the Shadowbringers trailer is that it's a good example of what you can do with a dedicated in-house composer. Because it means you can work directly with the team doing the trailer. I think the song is actually the official theme for the expansion, so it's not just something written for the trailer.
---
Yeah, Soken isn't afraid to vary the kind of music he does. So, you get the original version of the [Metal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhDvQIqEkuI) theme and then the [Brute Justice Metal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pdqUzOH_Hg) version which instead sounds like a theme from a Sentai show. So, Brute Justice seems like a protagonist. Koji does a really good job with the lyrics to so many of the songs. The lyrics to Metal really fit with the goblins attitude towards the players in the fights. Also, contrast that with [Sophia's theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-T1k-9UvdlU) which came out in the same expansion.
---
Also, as much as I love Soken, I think Koji is kind of an unsung hero considering that he writes most of the lyrics.
---
Why is this post so heavily downvoted? Seems very unnecessary.
---
I honestly thought I'd miss the loot treadmill - it's a great driving force.
---
But then, I just started crafting my first ascended set, and there's something freeing about the thought that this is it - this is as powerful as this build is going to get until I git gud.
---
Although, if I want to play another build, it begins again. I guess it's kind of a treadmill in its own way, except I actually get the carrot eventually.
---
is...is it really that madatory?
---
like at all?
---
of course its a mobile link
---
Indeed. Being in Knödelbert's LA instance usually was quite entertaining, and in the worst case you could just turn off map chat for a while. A big loss for the community.
---
its really just swapping one problem (down state rallies turning fights) into another problem (hyper offense with minimal penalty for defense)... theres a happy medium in there somewhere
---
This probably speaks volumes about me, but 5 is *fantastic*.
---
With the last update plus perma quickness could go way smoother for sure, haven't really tested yet. However I don't see what meta event could benefit that much of it, most of them are too fast paced and the mobs die too quickly regardless. Maybe Tequatl, Sandswept Isles meta and events .. but I personally wouldn't recommend for Istan. On the bright side, one could simply have a hammer and swap or put it on and off based on the curse of action. One nice plus is condi cleaning due light field, if you manage to keep AA, you will have always the symbol up.
---
I dont think any of your ideas would be better than what it currently is. They are still cool and I might like to see them in some flavour but I dont know if they would be better than what we have now.
---
There is one that I would like to see above the rest and thats a /gg function like you said. In spvp bleeding people out is a legit strat, while i get why its good and i do it myself I catch myself often wishing there was a /gg function to play around that.
---
Could you share what you're wearing on 3? The houndskin one
---
FSB made people join Volition Cult even though she never interacted with the guild at all. So I asked nicely if she wanted to either start a guild herself since people join because of her, or interact with the guild more, else I have to kick. She then started spouting in mapchat that she got kicked cause we were sexist. Fuck fsb ^^
---
&gt; It's just an "instant escape" button.
---
If something like that were to happen you would still die and be defeated so maybe the points get awarded to who ever downed you since you /gg'd yourself.
---
Damn I made an account, but no key. Was trying to get one for a friend to get back into the game. If anyone has an extra one to spare, I'd be eternally grateful.
---
Which would exclude spvp players like Teldo but it wouldn't exclude people like caed, jumper, davinci, satarrcoeny, vee wee, and literally everyone ever mentioned on gw2drama.net
---
The dev personally worked with Anet to validate the tool, and they stated that as long as the features were the current ones, it was ok.
---
Build templates and DPSmeter are ok, but things like gear checking are not.
---
Well, he's died and come back to life over 2500 times..so whats a missing eye here or there?  Has yet to lose his hand or leg, tho, which I can quickly remedy!

Your raptor can read? :o

LOL some random mini I had at the time, I swear!  Some of my best friends are Elonian.
---
Name one of those non-Guild Wars projects.
---
.... were the follow-up messages also that slow?
---
Lmao is that really true? I'm in a guild about Raid Training that he leads, and he seems to be super chill
---
In the hall you can have the syntetizer with the upgrades. For me it's not the same but they are the same thing.
---
A good idea (but hard to introduce) it's can choose to move syntetizer and nodes in the instance. Or maybe introduce the nodes in hall too.
---
\[HMmm..?\]
---
Im the guy that recently did the dx12 comparison. Guess i have more stuff to look into
---
Honestly I was trying to get one for my wife as well. The odds were not in my favor for getting any of the keys. I barely got lucky enough to get one of the egg keys.
---
Because they are personal unlocks that YOU unlock, not something your guild unlocks.
---
There's even more problems. They would be used as EWP when enemy attacks. You could just keep building them if enemy destroys/disables. And beside, as I mentioned Warclaw already reduces traveling speed greatly, so deploying them only in your territory makes no sense. If a use costed supply, people would burn supply super quick, just respawn -&gt; pick supplies -&gt; die -&gt; respawn -&gt; pick supply -&gt; die -&gt; ..., and supply can be wasted super quick even without that. Sorry, I just don't see a way to make this idea working &amp; balanced.
---
This needs a /s tag because it totally fooled me.
---
It mentions WvW
---
You get an upvote for this, my man.
---
Nice to see you're still at it, enjoy!
---
Its pretty cool to see your progression and all the screenshots youve take and forgot about.
---
well, unfortunately the "hammer" trait [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Glacial_Heart](Glacial Heart, in Virtues) is not amazing.  Its a definite buff, but you won't lose much ignoring it.  good news is that the trait line that is supposed to buff Hammer (Virtues) isn't...amazing either.  
---
There are arguments that it could be okay in one-on-one style fights, but overall it really doesn't give much except a decent damage buff if you can keep from losing Aegis (becomes far more difficult in open world with more enemies).  
---
So that opens things up a bit.  You'll run into a few issues with Hammer.  Primarily, it is a fairly slow weapon.  Your autoattacks are slow and cooldowns aren't all that impressive on the whole with the exception of your 2.  That being said, you have a buttload of CC and a fairly low cooldown Blast finisher, plus on any fight that lasts long enough for you to start autoattacking, you'll have basically permanent Protection (thanks to the symbol from your hammer's final auto chain attack).
---
Because your AA literally places a symbol beneath your enemy, I think [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Zeal](Zeal) is a pretty obvious choice.  Either Fiery Wrath or Zealous Scepter are probably decent choices.  The first will give you some extra damage against enemies that are on fire, the other will give you some might every 5 strikes (actually quicker than it sounds, symbols pulse damage, after all).  If you take the Scepter option, use a scepter/focus as your swap weapons.  
---
Master tier, take Blinding Jeopardy.  This will make your immobilization skills (Hammer and Scepter 3) inflict vulnerability in addition to the normal effects.  Plus the other two options are...not great for hammer.  
---
GM tier, obviously Symbolic Avenger.  Now you deal more damage for every one of your symbols an enemy is currently standing in (you can probably get 3 if you time things REALLY well...don't bother not worth it).  You have a symbol on your hammer autoattack (final strike) and scepter 2.  between them, you'll probably want to hammer 3, then hammer 2, then autoattack until you place the symbol.  swap to scepter and use 2 immediately, then start fucking its day up with focus 4 and autiattacks/spirit sword/whatever.  Its not pretty, might not even work right, but its the closest thing i can brain this late at night.
---
As for other traits?  ...if we're talking core guardian probably [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Radiance](Radiance) and [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Honor](Honor).  I will freely admit i am less familiar with the trait lines other than radiance/zeal/dragonhunter/firebrand.  
---
Honor is a weird line that is really defensive, and if you're looking at a elite spec I'd recommend dropping Honor before the others.  Protector's Impact gives a lesser symbol on heal skill useage, Empowering Might grants (very little) might when you use a heal skill, and Writ of Persistence increases the area(!) and duration(!) of your symbols.  Which is nice.
---
Radiance has so many great traits.  Unfortunately, you won't be able to take full advantage of many of them.  Stuff like Right Hand Strength is great, but most of the effect is locked behind using a one-handed weapon (so it'll buff your scepter by a little) and especially a sword.  Healer's Retribution and Inner Fire are also good, but you probably won't be wanting to use your heal skill quite that often, and open world PVE is unreliable with providing enough burn stacks on enemies to give you fury (Though it is a good idea to test them both out, especially Healer's Retribution...the reason why will become apparent very soon.)  Right Hand Strength is all that's left from Adept tier.  At Master tier take Retribution which gives you a very nice damage boost when under the effects of Retal (you won't benefit from this as much as a GS guardian would.  Unfortunately).  Grandmaster, take Rightous Instincts and don't look back.  25% extra crit chance AND might per interval while you have Retaliation.  
---
_______________________________
---
Its important that you understand a few things about this advice.  First, I only partially know what I'm talking about.  I main a Guardian, but am not an expert at this game.  I also don't use hammer, I use GS.  But I just looked over the traits and picked ones that would help you out.  Easy access to symbols is nice, but it being locked behind a slow attack chain is a problem.  That leads to the second thing you need to understand: this is not going to be *optimal*.  Might not even be *good*.  I do feel like its a decent starting point.  Experiment a bit, see if anything from the other trait lines might help you out more.  I do think that this would be improved (like most things) by taking DragonHunter.  You'll get another pretty nice damage boost, and some really nice bursty damage utility skills.
---
As for utilities...a lot of damage will be locked behind retal.  Guardians have like, 4 reliable ways to get retal: heal skill with Healer's Ret., Shouts, one consecration, and GS skill 3.  
---
[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/%22Save_Yourselves!%22](Save Yourselves) is on a long cooldown, but gives 10 seconds plus a host of other boons, and pulls conditions off of nearby allies onto yourself.  
---
[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/%22Stand_Your_Ground!%22](Stand your Ground) is on a shorter cooldown, only gives 6 seconds of retal, but breaks stuns and gives stability.  
---
[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hallowed_Ground](Hallowed Ground) is a ground-targeted AOE that will pulse retal and stability out to yourself and nearby allies for a bit, capping out at a total of 16 seconds.  Also something of a long cooldown.  NOTE that you need to stay inside the area to actually get the full retal duration.  
---
You'll also probably want Bane Signet in, for the power boost.  And elite...Feel my Wrath.
---
&gt; Traps were not exclusive to Ranger pre-HoT
---
And things don't have to be exclusive to be iconic. Traps were designed to be part of the rangers identity because it suits the lore of the nature bound survivalist and - again - because of how iconic trapping rangers were in gw1.
---
&gt;Also thief and warrior had bows as well.
---
Again: yes longbow was not unique to the ranger, but that 1500 range was! The only other weapon with that range was the rangers own harpoon gun and even now only a kneeling rifle deadeye will equal that range. (longbow on war was pretty popular even pre-hot btw, at least in PvP, because of it's ranged immobilize and aoe blind btw^^)
---
And having pet gameplay is not unique to the ranger either. Ele hast elementals, thieves thieves guild summons, necros minions, mesmers clones and phantsms. Yes all of those play extremely different from having a pet as a ranger and non of them fulfils the fantasy  of having a permanent companion, but mechanic wise they are pet classes as well.
---
&gt;Warrior is... I don't have anything for that one. I know they have the adrenaline mechanic and their banners, but outside of that, they don't seem to have anything unique.
---
Warriors have plenty of unique things, but they don't have that one singular aspect around which the class is structured. And the reason for this is - while the degree my vary - no class does rely on one aspect alone. Classes tend to have a theme and multiple aspects that compliment that theme. 
---
For the warrior one of the iconic apsects is having access to more different (mostly melee) weapons than any other class. None of these weapons is unique to the warrior, but it is an aspect that complements the idea of a strength based,  (melee) weapon wielding master of arms. Other aspects are support via things that seem flavour-wise connected to upholding moral on a battlefield(Shouts, banners) and brow physical, direct, full impact combat (physicals).
---
Rangers on the other hand are -as mentioned before - nature bound survivalists, that can trap, have access to long ranged weapons and nature based support and heal abilities and, yes, also the pet. These things complement each other, but non of them is the alone class core.
---
&gt;I think this is subject to opinion, since a lot of the people, people who have commented in this thread even, were very happy with Soulbeast because it "got rid of the pet".
---
Mechanically yes - and as discussed only in certain game modes. But while it does allow for fighting without the pet physically there, the choice of and active interaction with your pet becomes more relevant than ever.
---
&gt;In the sense of managing the merge and whatnot, yes that is true. Especially for modes like PvP and roaming in WvW. Raids you just camp it.
---
And in raids a deadeye camps rifle in melee range. Meta builds for raids are not very concerned with class fantasy.
---
Personal instances and nodes existed long before guild halls where introduced and abandoned
---
People already do waste supply, die, and respawn though. You can get into a tower with warclaw through a zerg, just as easy as a waypoint. This disruption to gameplay already happened with the warclaw, and I love it. We where stagnant in WvW for months before warclaw, but then it changed everything and it's great.
---
I just want new shit to fuck around with, even if it's just a weekly tryout (which they're obviously doing with no downed state), then I welcome it. It's really honestly not that radical an idea to me.
---
Dude I love the look, very well done

I really like #3!

I like how his blind eye changes. What a faker!!!1

You got me lol

The biggest draw of expansions for me is the elite specs. I just want more of those with the next living world season, otherwise I'll probably get the new mount and stop playing again in favor of ShB coming out for FFXIV.
---
\&gt;guild pistol
---
well done
---
I'd rather just have some tomato soup with it.
---
Renewed Focus and that much boon duration is a bit overkill IMO, and you have only 50% ish crit chance with Fury with this build. With perma Quickness one should be able to give good enough Protection in Hammer with some splash on weaponswap to GS.
---
I think a classic damage setup with Diviner trinkets would net more damage, which is what Hammer lacks.
---
[removed]
---
I'm a casual PvE player.  I've got a lot of laurels, karma, and those 'gold coins' that aren't in game money.
---
What are the best resource gathering tools for me to get, if I'm primarily interested in getting as much resources as I can so that I can finally craft some ascended gear?  Also what other items can I obtain using the aforementioned laurels and karma that will be helpful in my quest to craft (rather than buy) said gear?
---
I like the first one a lot. And the 5th one looks like that guy from my class.
---
&gt; theres a happy medium in there somewhere
---
Sure, but that'd require a set of classes, abilities and even an underlying combat system actually designed **for** mass-combat PvP. Or even mass-combat PvE. Not in spite of it.
---
I crafted a legendary armor set from raids 10 hours ago.
---
&gt;Honor is a weird line that is really defensive, and if you're looking at a elite spec I'd recommend dropping Honor before the others.  Protector's Impact gives a lesser symbol on heal skill useage, Empowering Might grants (very little) might when you use a heal skill, and Writ of Persistence increases the area(!) and duration(!) of your symbols.  Which is nice.
---
For hammer builds, Honor is extremely important due to the symbol grandmaster trait. That one is a massive boost to your overall damage, no matter that the adept and master traits aren't that great. For that reason, Zeal and Honor are pretty much fixed lines in a PvE hammer build.
---
If you have a guild at hand which goes raiding every week and doesn’t mind a newcomer, start your Provider Token stuff right now (getting the gear to exchange)
---
If you don’t have a raiding guild, go with the PvP legi armor. This one has no player chosen gate like raids and you can do it all on your pace.
---
You still able, doesnt look like it will be away any time soon
---
You guys even read the post? OP proposed the WvW "/gg" be a 5 skill in downed state. Not actual raid command. You can already just waypoint when ooc, and in combat you always give away the points if you die. So even raid implementation of /gg would have zero impact.
---
That'll be the cosmos in you consider the multiverse hypothesis likely.

Chances are it contains several universes.

To be fair, it is hard to beat a halfway decent Medi Scrapper right now, let alone a Medi Scrapper with damage support from another player.

Yes it's not worth much but rather than let them go to waste why not just give them to people who need them cause they don't play much PvP/WvW

Then they just match very well ... sorry :)

I had the exact same issue! Same place in the story and everything. I tried it about 6 times in a row each time it’d DC at the exact same point.

I did do some googling at the time and people were suggesting just to spam abilities etc.

 *What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.*

For generic open world/LS content, am I better off building my FB as condi or power? I only ask because it's already got berserker gear/trinkets, but I didn't like DH.

[Read over this guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character). Lots of options for laurels though they are a limited resource, not so much for karma.
---
Try disabling virtual memory and then enable it again after getting done with story. Let me know if this helps.

Whats that Outgit in 12, that looks really goof man! Keep it up👌🏻👌🏻

Which one? What cost? How long it took to have full set?

Diviner.

Soulcleave's Summit is very very strong even without healing power.

However, if yu really have a team that needs more on demand heals, or just in case the day's Instabs are too difficult to deal with for yur group, then Harrier.

Balthazar would have fitted some years ago
---
Ummm if you have black lion statuettes from using black lion keys you can buy the beanie from the statuette vendor, if its still there.
---
150 Li with a max of 15li/week means you'll have to raid for at least 10 weeks, also the provisionner's token are timegated (around 10/day if you don't want to put a lot of gold inside).
---
It's around 300-400g per piece, so you're looking at the cost of a big legendary weapon, but not much more.
---
Also, raids are a big source of ascended armors/weapon/trinkets, so that's good to gear up other chars.
---
Trees are for harvesting for your next legendary, not a play thing.   And Slyvari are out in force killing their own kind at Pagga's waypoint every hour of every day, easily the most evil race in Tyria.
---
LOL monkey shinezz so good, he was actually really good at defending
---
Heal revenant+power firebrand is the best combination of supports for fractals if you need a healer. With better players, you can use diviner stats and the kalla heal+elite will be enough for your group.
---
A pirate of the black pearl. Looks really cool. And the nights watch looking one too, what's the coat skin on that one.
---
Heavy. 2000g maybe, not sure. Since I already had more than enough LI it was 33 days of provisioner token collection.
---
I have enough. But according to the wiki, it's unavailable through those as well.
---
Jil was really annoying and just farms pve whenever I see him.  Then if things don't go well starts raging in chat

I believe Riverside but not 100% sure

It'll be alright. I'm used to waiting in things like this. I recall first finding out about the Wedding Attire Outfit three days after it was removed from the gem store. Definitely snagged it when it went back up. Makes my male norn look very… royal? Looks great on male asura as well.

Anything that not news/meme/art/screenshots gets downvoted to hell. Pretty normal here

I've played rifle berserker ever since HoT came out. Over the years, ANet has 'indirectly' buffed certain skills + traits you'd wouldn't normally expect someone to be using in WvW. Skills like Might sig actually giving might &amp; "On My Mark!" huge buffs (changed to ammo system etc). These two skills alone make it so that a) unblockable, more might and b) anti-stealth, vulnerability more dmg means you will practically one shot most classes that are also running glass/squishy. So in a group setting with 25 might stacks + buffs, traits etc... who ever you hit is definitely yeetus deletus.
---
To give you an idea of the dmg numbers from Gun Flame alone (solo roam + small scale roam) I'll give you the following from my experience (full asc zerk + foods + infusions etc):
---
* Always = 7.5k-10k on tanks/sustain (maybe with protec boon?)
---
* Very common = 14k-15k
---
* Somewhat Common = 16k-18.8k literally deletes thieves, mesmers, rangers some of the most common roam classes
---
* Uncommon = 19k on glass
---
* Somewhat rare = 20k+ on glass
---
Now that ANet has changed berserker in certain ways you will see an increase in people playing it, even if it's just for gimmick.
---
As of late, I've been hitting solid 18-19k+ Gun Flames due to the way ANet has been making changes... and this isn't with Scholar runes due to the playstyle I prefer requiring baiting the enemy by taking lots of dmg and looking like an "easy kill" noob.
---
I hopped on to test out the new arc divider.. yeah... it can basically 'one shot' squishy classes with numbers higher than 7.5k+ per hit... ouch. I mean hell in PvP I got hit by 8.8k arc divider over and over. I guess with any flavor of the month people will get used to when to dodge etc, it's why I love and still rock rifle war because absolutely no one I've come across expects it as so.
---
If you want to see my highest hit with Gun Flame so far just click my username, should have the pic in the banner.
---
Powercreep Wars 2.
---
The ad is generic enough to fit the part.
---
To add to his misaimed rant: games like that actually exist, and they usually die within years. The simple reason is that a game with only whales is an empty game. You have to make the game enjoyable to the pleb so the whales have someone to play with / show off to.
---
Now GW2 of course is as far from that design decision as possible, but my point is, game like that exist, and they don't survive for very long.
---
Now with that done, finally time to catch up with the Living Story! Oh boy, can't wait to mount Aurene and slay Kralkatorrik once and for all!

---
I haven't head of them going to $15 USD, just $25 USD (50% off).  Anyway, apart from August (GW2 anniversary) and March (annual sale) no one really knows. 1
---
Diviner hands down. Let the firebrand do the healing he is so much better at it as far as fractals goes. Heal renegade suffers due to energy management, but when your diviner your primary skill on spam is really only your f4 skill for perma alacrity, then the rest of your secondary important skills will be khalla elite and break bar skills like the khalla daze and staff 5 or stability with dwarf. Energy is more manageable and if there is NPNG, switching your non khalla stance to mallyx for boon corrupt is ezpz.
---
You might still be able to get PoF for free through the Alienware thing. (Unless if that ended already... I wasn’t checking the dates)
---
Oh this is such a fantastic explanation, thank you. I'm actually really enjoying the axe, so I'm thinking I probably will end up going for condi over power. Also, the whole "burning things with holy fire" is pretty damn cool.
---
I agree it looks more sylvari than human. Like I swear that face is available in-game even.
---
Interesting decision to make her wings part of her arms, since Aurene is a dragon, not a wyvern. But still, it has a nice flow-y style to it.
---
All-in-all, it looks really cool! You definitely captured a lot of her design cues in a unique way.
---
Tried this yesterday and codes ran out. :(
---
They're all gone. I tried last night.
---
That's a creepy combination between a furry, a cat, a sylvari and a dragon. Can we burn it before it lays eggs?
---
Last one is incredible, I love it!
---
I'm looking to start a healer for fractals (and eventually raids) and Im thoroughly confused.  One post says HealScourge is absolutely awesome, another says it's the worst support and that Druid sits at the top, yet another a as ys Renegade is just better at everything after some recent needs, and today I saw a post saying in Firebrigade teams, to leave the healing to the Firebrand.  Every post or metabuild I read gives me seemingly conflicting information. 
---
I know every class is somewhat viable for everything but if I just want to play a "White Mage" style dedicated solo healer with high boon uptime, how do I best fill that niche?
---
Ahh good sir, you committed a comedy.
---
I already have, many of those are outdated though or in low quality. The list i just made updated/refined many of them while i also included alot of new ones that had'nt been done before. For this new list i mention in this post i want to gather together all possible good ones in 1 place so it's more accessible for the community, hence why im trying to get in touch with cosplayers :).
---
I'm still having a lot of fun on my reaper, and it's nice being able to switch to scourge if I want condi for a zerg battle or something.
---
I mean, to me it looks terrible. Too cartoony, the asura look like giant babies and not like the cave creatures they're supposed to be. The assets are just slightly modified ingame stuff, hair on a norn for example lacks physics. Overall tone of it is also just off. The Wyvern looks greenscreened in and plasticy. Not to mention the glowy weapons. While true, you will see a lot of those ingame I always hoped anet themselves at least had a slightly better image in their head of what the art direction of the game should be like if it were translated into something like a CG cutscene. 
---
I'm assuming there are people this will appeal to, otherwise this ad wouldn't exist, but I personally can't think of it as representing GW2 at all.
---
Firebrand has a ton of stat options due to its single-condition focus. Since you can cover all your condition duration needs with traits, runes, and a sigil, you can use any gear with Condition Damage: Grieving gives extra power damage, while Seraph or Plaguedoctor give boon duration for a hybrid support build, so on and so forth.

Most classes need Viper: they generally use two or more damaging conditions that all need their duration boosted with the Expertise the stat gives, then use more generalized runes to boost duration or damage on all of them. FB certainly can run this route, and it's roughly equal in damage to Grieving or Sinister (the other two all-damage condi sets) since it boosts bleeding damage and has runes that increase burning damage rather than duration. Since it's basically equal and the gear is much more interchangeable with other classes, Viper is the easiest to recommend. It's not surprising you haven't heard of the other options.
---
This is awesome!  
---
Could you paint her in her three stages; Adorable young, Rebellious and doesn't listen to her parents teen, and Angsty  Post Joko eater young adult?
---
Check updated dx12 too!
---
There is also a great burn burst build with S/T - M/Sh that is quite tanky and not as prone to getting kited as the power build. By swapping to a longbow on one of the sets it also becomes quite good in zerks
---
Those eggs are already laid inside your brain.
---
Sorry if someone asked already but what is the sylvari one on the top right row?
---
Druid. Lots of healing, lots of boons, no fuss. Firebrand and Renegade are typically used as a pair, which requires requires lot of coordination: either one can heal, or both can do damage and leave healing to someone else. Very fussy and more likely to be used in regular groups than random pick-up groups where you can sort out that stuff in advance.
---
Scourge and Tempest are also both awesome healers but with much narrower niches and shouldn't be considered for general purpose healing.
---
I didnt think of that. I'll message the guild and ask about it. Thanks!
---
I'm not familiar with Renegade but I am with HS and Druid.
---
In terms of pure healing and carrying the team through hard time (rezing, compensate for mistakes) HS is the best, no doubt. HS can be geared to provide some might stack but it's not as efficient in support as Druid (see below)
---
Druid is better in more experienced group because it provides better offensive support (but I think it just got nerfed a bit) With a more experienced group who knows how to stay alive, this extra support is more important.
---
So in raid, you can run one Druid and one HS to complement one another.
---
Womp. :(
---
lmao 😂👌
---
There is a questions thread...
---
Watch out, 5 is the vegan hipster
---
Do *not* get them from a code site unless you’re comfortable with risking your account.
---
5 is probably my favourite. There's just something about the Murder-hobo aesthetic that makes me happy.
---
Exactly. Literally removes all choice. If it stays in the game it should last twice as long at least. OR let rage skills also trigger peak performance. OR let any utility skill activation trigger peak performance if it's only going to last 6 seconds.
---
&gt; I agree it looks more sylvari than human.
---
I did base it off a sylvari, feeling like that would be more consistent with the game's design direction, and then modified it with the parts that are characteristic to her as a dragon, like that nose/forehead "fan" protrusion. So yeah, definitely more *"humanoid"/"humanized"* than *"human"*, but I kinda don't like the sound of those words. Maybe the "ear" parts could've went for horns instead of those crystals on the head? Dunno; couldn't find something more interesting for that very top.
---
&gt; Interesting decision to make her wings part of her arms, since Aurene is a dragon, not a wyvern.
---
Yeap, I've been pondering on that for a while, and decided to go for arm-wings since it's more unique and weird than simply wings on back. Wings on back for a dragon humanization feel rather boring at this point, IMO.
---
&gt; All-in-all, it looks really cool! You definitely captured a lot of her design cues in a unique way.
---
Thank you :3 I think it looks fair for the lesser time I tried to pour into it, not overthinking too much.
---
That screen doesn't even look like Guild Wars to me.
---
I think the 2 utilities must be banners way that warrior evolved as a class sucks, though as a necro (and I imagine most classes), Id prefer that over having 2/3 utility options be worthless/passive. Many classes just throw a signet (that they never pop) or something else that just sits there yet warrior does the same thing, except that passive makes them mandatory in raids. Id enjoy having banners straight deleted from the game, or at least spread out amongst the classes so you can have a spirits situation (druid can split the spirit load with any soulbeast in the raid), but in the meantime, its not super different from other classes.
---
Its called balancing. Warrior has very good utility skills, strong weapon skills, good traitlines. Allowing warrior best pick of everything would blow all warrior builds way out of proportion.
---
So anet balances this by limiting factors, like moving a flat dmg increase trait to a buff on utility skill use.
---
Im sorry, but you are complaining about first world problems here. There's some finetuning issues left for berserker, but the core concept of it is very good. You have both a condition build on it AND a power build. Both builds are definitely part of the meta, they might not be best-in-slot ... we will see ... but thats true about 90% of all dps builds.
---
And on banner variant builds its actually THE meta. The only meta.
---
So, no, Im sorry, but your complaints are whats irrelevant here.
---
Ipos doesn't even need to be your currently active weapon for this to work. I.e. you can have incinerator/incinerator as weapon set A and anything/ipos as weapon set B. Then when you draw the daggers and sit on a chair you wil have 2 flamey hands and the book floating in front of you for that extra bit of gw2 bling.
---
But the OP is literally asking to remove banners (and thus a massive part of the "Allowing warrior best pick of everything" you are referring to here, which is not what the thread is about regardless)?
---
Man it's a long time since I played rifle warrior. Got that build of yours lying around if I may see it?
---
GW2 doesn't get a new set of elite specs released twice a year (or whatver heartstone's pace is). Don't overthink it.
---
So.. I tried playing the "the sacrifice" Quest in the Crystal Desert. When I enter Makali Outpost for the First time, the whole story plays and in the end it says "Exit Makali outpost" but I can't. No Button and I am unable to Interact with the door.
---
When I log Off / on it tells me to get into Makali outpost and the same Story part with the same outcome as above repeats itself.
---
Anyone have an idea how to fix this?
---
Whining about banners is something I really don't get
---
What it offers to war is a spot in like EVERY raid and fractal group ever
---
Yes, having a really good dps war build would be a nice addition. You can (could ?) already do that on condi bosses with cDPS zerk, and if you're at over 25k realistic with pSB I don't see any reasonable group kicking you out (except if you're going for speed, bit if you're going for that, general viability isnt really your problem)
---
So you've gota niche spot which guarantees you spots in groups and you're crying about not having access to the most competitive spot in a raid... 
---
What would you bring in those 2 utility spots anyways ? The 2 signets ? Some survivability stuff ? Your shiny leg greatsword instead of mace mace ? 
---
I'm quite happy to provide party buffs and cc instead, but idk, maybe teamplay is out of fashion these days
---
Ye it does, if I saw it I would have thought they made a mobile game
---
Instead they added trophy armour for the new player experience
---
Which one did they remove? The ARmor or the backpack? Cause all other replies so far said I can still obtain them.
---
Decorating a guild can be very fun.
---
&gt; if you read the post youd know hes not asking reddit to do anything about it, only asking what more he can do to help his case.
---
So he is asking reddit for advice, thats something. The problem with these kind of posts is almost always, the OP is lying or at least, leaving out a relevant portion of the truth, just like in this case:
---
* They claimed support isnt talking to them anymore while there was still an open ticket being worked on
---
* They claimed they have never done anything that would break the ToS, never had unfriendly relationships in game or been offensive to anybody while in fact they retaliated in game against another player they claim has done them some harm outside the game
---
* They claimed that Anet just suspended them because he got mass-reported by some guys without looking at the evidence
---
&gt; put yourself in his shoes, 7 years playing with no offenses and you get banned for what you can only guess is an unfair reason. why not turn to reddit to ask for help?
---
The problem is that they have tampered with their pair of shoes to fit their narrative. And we cant fix their shoe, only support can. Because OP isnt showing us the shoe, only describing it to us. Support can see the whole shoe.
---
It was a joke
---
recent changes turned them into tanky 2 seconds burst kill thieves without invisibility. they're fine, and pray that you don't face any roaming, they are a death sentence unless you have enough mobility to dodge and wait out their rage mode for an even field to fight them.
---
That's true but also not true - just this patch alone reintroduced Power Berserker as a build people are considering with the rework, functionally adding another "power elite spec" to the warrior pool.
---
Insert “brand me daddy” joke here.
---
if i could afford to give you Gold for this, i would
---
Yeah, if they're running something like Healing Signet or Mending, sure, but that's not what people are complaining about. People are saying Berserker is broken because they're dying to double Arc Divider via Blood Reckoning. Blood Reckoning's healing comes entirely from damage dealt after activation, meaning that if you have invulns or well-timed evades and kiting potential, the Berserker will have no sustain whatsoever. Another thing is people are saying that Arc Divider is hitting them for upwards of 18k damage. If Arc Divider is hitting that hard, that's because the Berserker is running very glassy gear and forgo Defense in favor of Strength for the 5% extra damage from Forceful Greatsword and 21% modifier from Berserker's Power. The cheesy build that a lot of people, myself included, are running is Demolisher's Amulet Strength/Discipline/Berserker GS + Sword/Shield. That build hits like a freight truck, but has literally no sustain and relies entirely on its movement and activate damage avoidance to not just get blown up. After the rework, it's more important than ever to focus Berserkers in fights. They've basically become the new Necros, meaning they're weak outside of Berserk form and it isn't instantly available at the start of a fight (similar to Shroud), they're typically running glassy builds (a bit like the Shadefire Scourge build, which relies HEAVILY on support to survive), and they're healing skill is both extremely situational (only should ever be used in Berserk mode or else you don't get a reset) and only heals you based on damage dealt. 
---
Berserker was extremely pubstompy before the rework, and it's just a pubstompy now.
---
More dragon girls is always a good thing.
---
This is creepy
---
So theres no rotation or priority skills to use in fights?  I feel so useless in pugs where everyone squirrels. Used to playing spellbreaker where I can carry a shitty pug. I had the minstrel set from when tank chrono was meta in pve so I figured I'd give it a go.
---
What is number 4!
---
Dhuum still pops up to kill players that get banned in GW1.
---
Stands also for Friday's for future. so don't worry.
---
You fail to understand whats really going on. You’re in a focus group right now. You visit a place called Guildwars2 subteddit- a place where FANS gather, not people who see things diffirently, and quite often those people, might just be right. If arenanet is smart, they’ll stop listening to people in the subreddit and start working on valid criticisms. Ask yourself this or try and answer me, why do these people look down on the game? Don’t just brush it off as “ohh a hater, fuck off”
---
Sure, but that’s assuming that those people actually  botted, albeit in the past. Anet has made A LOT of mistakes with false positive bans before, who is to say that this isn’t the case now?
---
That’s how the game was designed when anet actually supported it. It is not how it is in its current state.
---
Surely anet would never make a mistake.
---
Noob question: is Valkyrie a worthwhile stat mix or is it go all out Berserker or all out tank style (warrior here) depending on what you are doing?
---
Sure, but it's significantly more likely that people are lying about never botting , as is usually the case.
---
There has been false positives, not 'a lot'.
---
For each vindicated player that gets their account back, you have way more cases of a dev showing up someone who claimed they didn't cheat, along proof of what they did.
---
Are you talking about a panini press and/or waffle iron?
---
The ones that drop an extra bit of leather or cloth are useful if you're specifically gathering. You buy them for karma. Really, though, it's worth buying some materials and salvaging everything you get for the silk, mithril etc. 
---
Don't forget to check your bank for things you can sell. Shove them on the Trading Post and use the gold to buy materials you actually need. 
---
Use something like this: https://gw2efficiency.com/account/materials to help you choose what to sell. You need you API key, which you can get from the ArenaNet login page. GW2 Effifiency can *read* what's in your bank, but not make any changes, so it's safe.
---
Some bits of ascended gear are *hilariously* expensive to craft, but you can craft something cheaper and swap the stats in the mystic forge. The ones from the core game (not expansions) are usually *much* cheaper to make. 
---
Laurels and karma don't really convert into gold very efficiently. Probably worth keeping hold of them for a while.
---
Do note, guild vendors and the buffs from the Tavern require the Heart of Thorns expansion.\*

You know how in Elder Scrolls Skyrim people say the eight instead of the nine because Talos isn't a real god?
---
it's kinda like that but with a twist
---
Yes but how much of this is not from the gem store.
---
Banners, like quickness, like alacrity, like might, fury, protection, swiftness, aegis, stability are all part of the games skill and combat system. They are all buffs. Bringing them to buff your allies always, ALWAYS comes with a downside - as is only correct.
---
Whats so special about warrior that it shouldnt be impacted by this system? What about chrono, ranger, revenant, firebrand? Removing all buffs removes also all flavour from the game. Banners are a part of warrior, just as spirits is a part of ranger, quickness&amp;alacrity for chrono etc.
---
Either remove all, or remove none. Theres literally NO reason for just removing banners just because you feel yourself being "limited" by them.
---
You do realise your animosity is completely unfounded; as regardless of my attitude toward "creating my own rules" im the only solo (entire fractal) pov on youtube(world record). I am looking forward to someone coming out and saying im not alone and they have done it faster. 
---
You do realise that regardless of my opinion on the matter; 99cm is infact impossible to solo unless you use brs to solo siax (no question). I am all for the bending of gw2 rules in an attempt to find ways of solo'ing (hence 100cm ark on all 9 classes) but i can say i am close to 100% certain it is impossible to solo siax on any other class than brs (in gw2 at this current state 28/04/2019). (your comment was anticipated; hence why my friend kindly explained in the reddit thread about siax accordingly.)
---
Warrior already has huge health and not very high precision so it's a big waste.
---
Yes.  
---
As others may have said, start on your Provisioner Token acquisition sooner rather than later.  It takes somewhere around a month or so to get all 300 tokens you'll need for a full set of Envoy armor.

*will look into the subreddit*

I’m a new player and I got a code.

I will be playing so much more now thanks to Alienware. I’m honestly so excited that I got it. I love this game so much and this pretty much sealed the deal for me. I’m gonna be here a while.
---
Easy mode:
---
-Focus one one aspect of the game
---
-Find good resources on it
---
-Apply advice until you get good at it
---
Hard mode:
---
-Find resources on everything you do and apply advice, try to do everything better than you did it before
---
OTP mode:
---
-create a new character for each class, try them out until you find one you really like
---
-level it to 80 by playing it through the whole story and map completion, then play this character in all game modes, learn the class off by heart
---
-repeat for every other class you like
---
The whole level-scaling down system is absolutely amazing. It gives you a reason to go to low level areas and explore and do the hearts and other activities there. 
---
This is the first MMO where I didn’t Google “Best training spots.” LOL
---
was thinking 'hey this looks cool, why didnt i go with firebrand when trying to make a hammer guard alt?'; then i realised; the fucking awful crit chance from lacking radiance (and you cant really forgo the two symbol lines without giving up hammer... really should roll wriot of persistance into zeal somehow -probably replace blinding jeopardy)
---
They have not commented on them recently (that I can find) but [Anet has commented on them in the past](http://www.tentonhammer.com/articles/guild-wars-2-exclusive-interview-colin-johanson) (keep in mind this interview is from 2015 and with a dev who no longer works there). 
---
&gt;...capes currently don’t work with our animation and armor system. Hopefully someday that can change – cause capes are awesome.
---
Since that comment we received the [Banners of Ancient Elona](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Banners_of_Ancient_Elona)(2017). It is pretty much a cape, save the ornament at the top, which I'm sure they did as a way to get past trying to fix it directly to back of your character without causing too many clipping related issues. 
---
We'll probably never see super fluid capes that react to the player model, unless it's built into an outfit, because of the nature of existing armor and animations (per Colin's comment in that interview) but I hope to see more backpieces like the Banners of Elona in the future.
---
They also have tv ads and in pretty much every streaming platform that allows for ads, why people like you and the guy i replied to feels the need to spit out such unnecessary and uninformed opinions? It doesn’t take too much to research something  nowadays but apparently it does take a lot for some people to admit they are wrong lol

---
A nightmare.
---
Good bot
---
When they added the racing scarf I think it added a little bit of hope that maybe it's something "on the table" because the scarf has great cape animations/fluidity.
---
They have the physics just not the clipping
---
I understand this may not appeal to a lot of people thematically, but tbh i think a staff wielding "monk" style Warrior would work perfectly fine from a thematic stand point.
---
Elite specs are often meant to take a class in a different direction anyways, and we already have a damage oriented spec in the Berserker.
---
If guardians can have the Dragonhunter spec with a bow &amp; traps, i don't think a Healing Warrior is too out of the ordinary.
---
You mean sylvari form
---
For over a decade, they've only released for the Guild Wars franchise. The only thing they've said is that they've stopped working on side projects. Super adventure box and roller beetle racing were side projects. What is so difficult to understand?
---
But if you do feel I'm wrong, you can easily refute me by linking a direct quote from them that they were *non-guild wars* side projects.
---
Think of it this way in other games you have the holy trinity when this game you have classes with unique buffs.
---
Typical sylvari face but she looks fine
---
Also nice that depth blur screenshot.
---
With real money, just don't
---
Really depends on what you are working on. It's much less on the content unless you actually like the boss fights.
---
What Reaper burst anyways?
---
They're not picked often into Fractal CMs so that I'd have any usefull loggs to compare...
---
I got it on reddit.
---
Does it really have 11 millions current players?
---
Aids, cancer, ebola and parasites as far as I can tell.
---
I would actually really like to see the next Warrior spec by supportive. Something whereas Spellbreaker and Berserker are more simple, the third elite spec would make Warrior really complex and add F1-F2-F3-F4 buttons, similar to Scourge, each with their own adrenaline costs.
---
So you want druid to have literally no use at all
---
Unique buffs need to die. Banners should be equivalent to and not stack with spirits, and something equivalent should be added to 2 other classes. Maybe put it on elementalist elementals and something else.
---
I've said this before, but people always talk about (even in this thread) how balancing through uniqueness is the best way to do things, because that way there is always a reason to pick any class, even if their damage is meh. I think wow proves this to be bullshit, but even without the example of wow, it simply doesn't make sense from a logical point of view. Yes, balancing based on uniqueness makes the best in slot team comps more diverse, but most people don't play best in slot. If a class does not have a needed utility for a fight, they are useless. If utilities are easy to come by, and a class has less then perfect dps, they are still usable enough for the vast majority of teams, because most teams care more about having a team that works then having the best team. 
---
Contrary to popular belief, PUGs are usually totally fine with dropping from a top DPS class to a fine dps class, as long as the drop isn't absolutely massive, but they are far less likely to run without classes who are perceived to have needed utility, even if that utility isn't actually needed (Like, say, banners). This is a weird mentality thing that has been proven over literally decades of evidence from MMO's, and isn't going away. Unique utility kills team diversity and gameplay fun for the vast majority of people, and if you don't agree you really need to take a closer look at the games you are playing.
---
It doesn't help that buffs in this game, with the exception of the truly terrible for other reasons alacrity, aren't good gameplay. They are all either spam on CD or completely passive. This game would be better (from a PVE perspective, can't speak to pvp) if might, fury, banners, spirits, ect. just didn't exist, because no one would notice except the few classes who would now have more fun utility and trait options.
---
Cause their marketing team was almost non-existent and they relied solely on word of mouth tactics by players (which normally works, but not with gw2 community), and a lot of resource was put elsewhere.

I have been seeing a lot of ads for GW2 lately. They are mostly still images, but they had a sweet one on Facebook that was like holographic? They image would move with you. It was pretty cool

I really like the "downed, no ally" idea because it means lesser skilled players in your zerg will not be considered an active liability.

That said, I want to see No Downstate Week be a thing again. It's really fun.

Seems like you do for body slot equipment only:

well, you gave up long ago
---
for you, anything seems worth reading
---
When does the funny moment start?
---
There's more ways to support than healing.
---
For example, the next warrior elite could be a Knight that uses turrets. Instead ranged, these 'turrets' would be mostly walls and melee attackers that enemies and projectiles cannot cross, allowing knights to set a defensive perimeter.
---
HOS-tile CON-tact!
---
there is just no logical reason you can think of

But seriously, Queen Bee Infusion, Chak Infusion, and it looks like Koda's Warmth? That last one could be Liquid Aurilium, because I have no idea how he got one boot and one glove to shine so much.

Don't say that too loudly or you'll find yourself on spirit duty soon enough.

I just never felt like there was anything I could recommend about GW2. Like, it's an alright game but there isn't really much to hype about to friends.... The only time I tried they just dismissed it
---
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9.  I usually like the more "grounded" appearances and the more outlandish the outfits, the less I tend to like them, but that's just me.

Just give Banners the GotL treatment and make them give boons instead of unique modifiers.

Seems kinda strange that they'd change it to a short suspension (as opposed to just removing the infraction entirely) if you're really not at fault for anything here.  Feel like spilling the beans?  It sounds like you were egging them on unnecessarily tbh

BAH!
---
My friend actually stopped playing due to frustration from not being able to easily find WvW action.  I'm sure there are ways but last time he and I played you could hop in and walk 5 feet and be neck-deep in enemies.  So, on his behalf, that's stupid.

I’d prefer a paragon style warrior, yelling at people to buff them.

I have a mesmer called Allisvain for years now and not once someone seemed to recognize where the name is from :c
---
You mean like soulbeasts are already doing now in druidless comps?
---
No downstate is fine, honestly, I love it. I reached my career high in PvP this season @1697 and I really like the combat in this game. The problem is that downstates significantly reduce the skillgap because 2v1s are almost unwinnable no matter how many skills a player misses and how badly they play their class.
---
WvW is already a game-mode that’s almost entirely determined by zerg sizes. It’s rare you’ll get two zergs of close enough size that coordination significantly affects the result (exceptions do occur)
---
No downstates heavily favor players with mechanical knowledge of a class, because with downstates, the enemy player just gets to sit there passively dealing damage, and threatening to come back at full health, allowing players with lower skill to just press F on eachother.
---
Yesterday, I managed to win a 4v1 by perfectly managing my movement and CDs and putting brutal amounts pressure on each individual. They lost because they were playing their class like they were in bronze. No coordination, all four of them just chased me up a stairwell in SMC because our zerg was losing the battle, so they just pressed W because in WvW players are so used to just pressing W and being unafraid because they can just get revived mid-fight if they get taken down.
---
&gt; paragon

you mean a shout guardian

I want to know too. I have a lot of wardrobe unlocks, but I don’t have that one. I love 10.

No system is 100% correct; all you can do is make the error rate as low as possible. Under 1% is pretty good.
---
Which, realtalk, I'm ready for extraplanetary adventures.
---
Why would they do that? If they decide that the costs outweight the benefits, they'll just shut them down. They don't need an excuse for it.
---
Yes, except in a world where Druid isn't considered meta and double spirit Soulbeast is.
---
Pass.
---
\*sad robot screech\*
---
Honestly I don't do any raids or fractals but WHY? 
---
Warrior as banner slave support has been in the game since release in those modes. So warriors have already had utility slots taken by them forever?
---
Only saying this as alot of people are asking for a warr support spec and so far as I know they alqays have been brought for banners. 
---
A healing spec? Maybe. If it was implemented right but I wouldn't be hopeful as it really doesn't make sense. Warriors currently have core which is useful for banners(support) and dps, berserker dps and spellbreaker (utility via boon strip) and pvp dualist.
---
I believe they are from the Koran dungeon
---
&gt; It sounds like you were egging them on unnecessarily tbh
---
there is always more, OP even phrases it like they were banned for the reason they think they were, mass reported with no investigation" Though I won't write details here, it seems like I was reported by few people who were angry with me as I expected." I really doubt it but who knows with anet sometimes.
---
At this point in gw1, I would much rather have botters if it means an innocent 10 year old gwamm account remains unbanned.
---
At 8.00.
---
I don't like/wear backpacks though :(
---
That's not how this game works. Everyone can help allies, even with the most offensive builds. Just to name one: Thiefs always have Signet of Agility in their bar:
---
* Passive: Grants increased precision.
---
* Active: Refill endurance and cleanse conditions from nearby allies.
---
Keep it passive to boost your dps, use it to help your subgroup.
---
&gt; stupidiously
---
TIL that's a perfectly cromulent word.

---
What are these white glowing circles around everyone in fractals? Stopped playing them sometime last year, so this seems to be new. No matter what instabilities were active, it seems everyone had these circles around them. What do they mean?
---
There are however classes that far exceed other classes when both are specced to do one thing (like DPS) and I believe that's what OP is looking for.
---
Because it's far better to organize in the voice chat like teamspeak or discord.
---
Any class can be played pure DPS.
---
In this game, Healers and Tanks don't exist in the same capacity. They sort of do, ok, but the terms are used as specific roles for specific encounters, not really used in your average dungeon or open world. Our builds are better generalized into DPS and Support, and most classes can be built into either. Traits and skills aren't permanently locked in on characters and can be reorganized at any time out of combat so you rarely get locked into a role.
---
Want squishy, fast-paced glass cannon DPS? Pick Elementalist or Thief. Want slow DPS with good survivability? Play Necromancer, Ranger, or Warrior. These are just a few examples I'm throwing out. If you want to be pure DPS my only suggestion is to maybe avoid Mesmer as it's the most support-skewed class, but even it has some pretty great DPS builds and is very unique and fun.
---
[Here's](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guide:What_Profession_Should_I_Play) a guide to the feel of how the classes play that may help. I'd suggest just trying out whatever sounds cool.
---
Add that to my list of things i wished i'd never seen
---
Warrior
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mistlock_Instability:_Social_Awkwardness
---
Instabilities had a big rework a few months ago.
---
Just to add to this you can easily do a farm run of metas at reset every day as you wish, some groups stay together from each meta too! But they are perfectly timed to do each: amnoon casino/td/ab/death branded shatterer (in jahai bluffs. You can always hit up the daily let line anomaly at :20 after instead of casino if you wish or if you're quick get both before td.
---
Mind telling me what spec?
---
in your update its unclear what you actually happened? were you 100% banned off the back of being mass reported? It also sounds like you perhaps have more fault here than you originally let on, perhaps you could clear that up aswell "Even if you're personally harassed outside game for unfair reason, don't try to avenge in the game."
---
Play a ranger if:
---
You like hunting dangerous enemies and winning through smart healing and positioning.
---
Bear bow op.
---
I love it when you can hear the commander calls in the vid. Great work!
---
You are mistaken. Don't need 100%, but 15% from pots is not enough. FB can manage just fine with full zerk, though.
---
Thief is another class you usually can't rank for their burst...
---
Hello there, I need some help here.
---
I've always wanted to get into WvW so I made a Rev, but later on I decided (for some reason) that he's going to be a condi Renegade.   
---
So now I have this Condi Renegade (myb half-way through getting Renegade, no Herald) that I literally **never** play (15h over the past 213 days), and I was wondering if it's a good call to delete him and just get a new class that I'd enjoy more.
---
Lots of people have said that I should keep him cause of the birthday rewards but, are they really that good? (as in so good that I should sacrifice a character slot for it).
---
As for buying more character slots, I'm not in the position to afford any gems atm (for around another couple months).
---
Sorry for going on, wanted to give a detailed description. Also if someone recommends I get a new class, any suggestions? (Been mostly leaning towards Medkit Scrapper)
---
Cheers!
---
I'm 99% sure those are Social Awkwardness hit-box markers.
---
The game doesn't really work the same way that WoW does, but if you're specifically looking for classes/builds that are commonly used for pure DPS (or close enough to pure DPS that their support is mostly passive and doesn't require any extra effort) in raids right now (subject to change with future patches):  
---
Guardian (Dragonhunter is the spec that's more likely to go closer to pure DPS, though Firebrand can too)  
---
Engineer   
---
Thief   
---
Elementalist 
---
There are others, but I think those would be considered the closest to "pure DPS" and the least likely to be expected to adjust fully or partially into a support role (though many of them certainly can fill support roles too).
---
No, I don't think you understand what meta means.
---
Warrior has always been able to compete with DPS. Right now pDPS Berserker is in a worse spot than cDPS BS (yes, banner slave, not DPS) was before the patch, but a better spot than pDPS was in. 
---
It's benching about 31-32k. That's Necro tier. Don't get me wrong, that's more than viable, but if you are looking for the absolutely best slot (you know, meta), it's basically the worst choice in the game.
---
Being able to bench that AND have banners would be great. That's why cBS was considered so broken. Unique buffs AND decent DPS. Now Berserker is in a spot where even losing banners, it can't match what cBS was doing.
---
For Warrior to get a meta spot (just like every other class) it needs to bring something. If you want a selfish DPS class, then that class has to put out crazy damage, and it needs to do it practically (which is why rifle DE isn't meta for most fights). Right now, DPS Warriors are a selfish DPS class that bring nothing but lower DPS than other classes. It's enough damage to clear raids considering so many people struggle to even hit 20k on easy fights, but not evenly remotely close enough to get a meta slot.
---
Viable doesn't mean meta. Again, there was a reason why cDPS Berserker was all orange and red boxes in Snow Crows rankings, despite getting pretty high benchmarks. We do less damage than that build now, and offer the same (zero) utility. We also lose reliability as well, as phases and sketchy pulls and alacrity up time in less experienced groups will take us out of Berserker, and leave us with pretty much just auto attacking. Before we needed alacrity just to finish our Berserker rotation. Now we need it to just do any damage at all.
---
Sure, just want to make sure that OP understands that it's not super restrictive. They aren't looking for necessarily the number 1 spot, so they should have a bit more freedom in choices
---
Somehow reminds me of dungeon defenders
---
Oh boy, you draw hentai too!  Time to commission my Rytlock x Logan dakimakura!
---
You pass butter
---
I've got both diviner's and harrier's available, and so far pugs always want diviner's, though my guildies want me on harrier's.  
---
I wouldn't take axe for cc - if nothing else the slow from deathstrike does the same defiance bar damage as temporal rift's pull (over 3s instead of ~1.25, but most of it'll tick during Surge of the Mists anyway). That said I was in 99cm the other day and we didn't seem to have any pulls for the nightmare hypnosses, so it would've been slightly more useful to have axe there than offhand sword. 99% of the time stick with sword/sword though.
---
stacking only dps is the least diverse thing, even if every class can fill it. it just creates very bland design and gameplay.  
---
diversity is created from different roles and different classes which can fit into one role.
---
Walking through the woods, it's Shia LaBeouf!

---
At least it wasn't your fault like it was mine. Clicked on a reddit front page post with some fanart marked as a spoiler... Without seeing what sub it was for.
---
Knew the ending to this story since then, and it ruined it for me too.
---
&gt; Warrior as banner slave support has been in the game since release in those modes. So warriors have already had utility slots taken by them forever? 
---
I literally explained this...
---
It's so banner slaves can become the dedicated healers of the group at the SAME TIME, while still being banner slaves. It's role compression, in a role which currently only the Ranger can effectively fill.
---
Having 2 classes capable of the same role compression, equals to twice as much comp variety.
---
\-
---
Look, a ranger will **always** be needed for its unique buffs. Whether it's healer or dps.
---
A warrior will **always** be needed for its unique buffs too. However it only has a dps option.
---
That means that due to the basic rules of maximizing role compression,  the ranger is almost always locked into the healer Druid spec, leaving the warrior to always use the pseudo-dps banner slave spec. There's no other way around it, because there's no other alternative.
---
However, if Warrior had a healer spec, it could capatalize on the same role compression that Ranger currently does.
---
That way, it opens up 2 paths:
---
1. Healer Ranger, with "dps" Warrior (which is the current mandatory meta).
---
2. Healer Warrior, with dps ranger (an entirely new comp)
---
And regardless of which one of those 2 comps you chose, you'll still have all the unique buffs in the game, making them **equally** viable as one another.
---
You **literally double**  the comp variety in a way which no other change could do.
---
I would love to say, you have a huge role, bla, bla, bla, but you don't.
---
As a mesmer main, i'm not even playing since last patch of 2018, which ruined all boonshare potential of mesmer.
---
Yeah you have really good CC, but well, it's not even required in most cases, especially not in pugs. 
---
Apart from CC, you are useless, yeah, there is illusion of life, but well, i don't find it that impactful in pugs. 
---
As for minstrel stats, i would suggest you switch from that, you don't use boon duration at all and healing is soooooo minimal it's just plain bad (and on a delay, no matter what way you go).
---
Instead just do some damage, since you are the one CC-ing, your damage is always going to be on point where everyone should bomb anyway, which makes is quite efficient, compared to most other classes, albeit smaller in raw numbers.
---
But yea, Mesmer atm is really boring and i would not suggest anyone to play it.
---
New elite specs, classes, continents? Yes I know they could technically still do that with patches but that was the plan 5 years ago when the game launched and they failed to do so. Plus an expansion announcement helps a lot in bringing players back to the game, which they really need.
---

Looks like a Sylvari with wings.
---
All things have a right to grow.
---
*For now.*
---
That's so furry it hurts
---
While I love the idea of a warrior support I do worry that being able to be healers + banners and leave another slot for dps basically means that no other Healer in the whole game is gonna ever be relevant and some soulbeast will bring spirits...
---
I personally believe that as long as the "unique buffs" don't cancel each other and you become forced to stack as many of them as you can the meta will never be healthy...
---
Also a lot of warriors love playing DPS, if bannerslave healer is the only "accepted" warrior people that play the class because of the fighter/brawler style will get screwed over...
---
Elite balance is in a tricky spot right now
---
Very true, he's absolutely not a chill guy

Touche, but in my defense it's a reference to hockey superstar Teemu Selanne and the fact that he has a penis.

I can't stand capes so I'm hoping we never see them.
---
Was gonna say the same thing. Looks like a batvari. I think it's the nose and forehead, looks like one of the faces for female sylvari.
---
I've had this problem on most story episodes. I read somewhere that it is connected to the cut scenes timing out on some connections. Some people found that if they keep moving or skip cutscenes, it has worked for them. Others suggest using a VPN when playing. I tried this method using a free VPN service and this solved the problem for me.
---
Horrifying.
---
I'm not terribly experienced with this game and seeing all these comics I don't understand at all is kind of amusing for some reason
---
Not enough raging in voice coms.  I'm used to being shamed with derogatory comments about my masculinity when we don't wipe the blob in 1 push.
---
&gt;  Looking at all available builds, no one uses Tactics anymore and even if you did take tactics what traits are you looking at? Basically only EA.
---
dont forget empowered. 1% dmg for each boon on you. Not as good as it used to be (boon chrono nerfs)but it lets tactics also increase your dps and a good reason to run core over a elite for a BS. Core lets you keep 2 other dps trees with discipline and strength and that lvl 3 burst for the CC on mace and easy upkeep time on berserkers power.
---
Never heard of it till I moved to this subreddit.

Nicely done. Don't really get why people are bashing it as rule 34 or furry and the like (it ain't, not nearly nfsw enough for that shit). I do agree it looks sylvari-like but that's probably because the face holds a high resemblance to [the bottom left face here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Sylvari_female_faces.jpg) (as well as quite a few exclusive faces like [this one](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Exclusiveface-sylvarifemale5.jpg)).

---
The steal payload (the recharge reduction, daze, and boon strip) are really important in sPvP.  Thief can't stand and fight most other classes, and it relies on the payload on steal to enhance windows of opportunity to strike.
---
I hesitate to say mandatory, because Critical Strikes offers so very little in PvP (by design), and Shadow Arts and Acrobatics had been some combination of pointless and 'eh' since the big trait rework, at least until Swindler's Equilibrium.  So it isn't like there are these game changing traits you are giving up for Sleight of Hand and friends.  If there were we'd find out how essential they really are.
---
Trickery definitely does contain some really powerful tools that were seemingly designed for sPvP and it is kind of dumb to have it (and Deadly Arts) alongside several trait lines that are seemingly designed to be bad - there really isn't much choice there.
---
All you have to do to find "wvw action" is ask team chat. They'll give you the discord/ts/voice program address and tell you where things are happening. At worst you can join a pug tag on EBG. Link servers have really eliminated many dead-zones for wvw, unless you're playing at odd hours.
---
Never gonna happen and there are two reasons:
---
a) spaghetti code - I've heard somewhere that backpacks are like weapons and these can't be dyed
---
b) how on earth will they justify sell [this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Feather_Wings_Backpack_(skin)), [this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/White_Feather_Wings_Backpack_(skin)) and [this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Macaw_Wings_Backpack_(skin)), among other recolors?
---
Mesmer is my main, and I fucking love WvW. Unfortunately playing them in zergs is so boring. Besides a few utility skills we just exist to breathe. 
---
I just run my own builds constantly changing traits and Specializations depending what I need or what I'm in the mood for. I'm usually glasscannon power.
---
Whats a Thief burst? Since Fractal CMs usually have less than 10sec uptime where the Boss is actually alive (in good groups).
---
Weaver, Soulbeast and Dragonhunter can get over 100k burst *(fcking Weaver get up to 140k, I've seen the logs lel)* where are Thiefes at?
---
&gt; Sooo... People are bitter that every class can't fill all roles perfectly ?
---
on some level yea. The feeling of being forced to do something if a game sucks. Maybe there is also a bit of jealously in there because their class doesnt have spirits/banners i dunno.
---
I share the same thought as you here btw. I dont see banners and stuff as a issue like alot of people do. I do think they could be changed so you have to trait to get them to be powerful for the group or something so warrior has a bigger difference between a BS build and dps build beyond 2 utility skills.
---
That's exactly what I do to make them.
---
Oh man I've got like 3 of these! I'll post them when I get home!
---
Oh my god...
---
Yes, master!
---
Excellent work, Detective Groundhog.
---
And I am not even a native speaker ... forgot to look up if I wrote this right, phew

Koda :)
---
I mean, it’s pretty mandatory I’d say. In terms of being successful that is. Otherwise, if you take that away, thief basically has semi-unreliable damage especially if someone is stacking protection/aegis/retal boons. Trickery allows those boons to be ripped and also a minimal amount of CC. If you don’t take Trickery, you’re hindering your abilities by quite a lot.
---
Also people complain about floating stuff, but I think they could do with making two-handed weapons float *further* from the character model than they do now, to reduce clipping with many, many chest armor skins and outfits.
---
It's cool , you'll get it eventually. Bookmark em maybe , cause they're pretty good

Idea: an elite spec that improves the AI of the pet, allowing it to walk out of red circles!

This comic isn't the best, but I believe the joke is that in Malchor's Leap, some of the dialog is programmed to be heard from quite far, including the part where Malchor's ghost jumps and yells "DWAYNAAAAAAAAA". It may or may not be a bug. Sometimes it's intended that event chain dialog can be heard from super far, but sometimes they make it further than intended.
---
A lot of that looks like the Bounty Hunter gear from PoF. I have those gloves on my Ranger and the rest of the set matches the aesthetic.
---
&gt; I do agree it looks sylvari-like but that's probably because
---
...I cheated and based it off of a sylvari face and body :3 I think it fits the design direction of the game that way, and TBH, I'm not sure whether any fully humanoid slender figure of unnatural colour wouldn't look like a sylvari given how diverse they are.
---
I'm currently playing as Ele and I've read that it will be really hard for me to complete the story content as the mobs are difficult and deal a lot of damage. Will it be okay if I just boost a guardian and do the story content as him and use any rewards i receive on the ele? Or is there some rewards, bonuses etc that will only be on the character with which I complete the story content with? (I'm talking about Living Story, expansion packs etc)
---
Wow, that's quality research!
---
They're incredibly cheap, considering all their sources have been discontinued. I suspect there's still quite a backlog on the market.
---
That's not how WoW works either, every class has some kind of button they can push that helps their team - that's not OP's point. It's obvious from OP's examples that thief would be a "pure DPS class", since its support options when building for DPS are comparatively limited and less impactful.
---
Is it worth deleting my Thief for a Necro?
---
I started leveling a Thief not too long ago, got to level 53 and just now I realized I don't really enjoy the class (enjoyed videos on youtube, but don't enjoy playing myself).  
---
I was thinking of doing both PvE and PvP on this char so I figured Necro would be a better option.
---
What do you guys think?
---
Once you learn to stop worrying about gold and other rewards will you be able to have fun again. Very few people know how to balance it, even the ones that do most often times don't.
---
It's a video game, don't turn it into a job or a chore. Go do what you find fun regardless of the beneficial gain from it. The only gain you should focus on is having fun. Nearly everything rewards you in this game, eventually it pools up as long as you don't spend it on silly things.
---
I tend to use it a lot even when I don't need to. It just adds yet another enjoyable element to the "freedom of movement" that mounts offer.
---
If the enemy doesn't know your there (or you want to hit from stealth so they cannot predict it) both Mesmer and Thief have builds that can down someone in about 1 - 1 &amp; 1/2 seconds.
---
if that is not your cup of tea then warrior when well played is extremely good.
---
About the equipments, having lvl 1 blank equipments is fine then? No need to go around looking for sigils and amulets like the ones in PvP?
---
I’ve only been playing for a week and don’t even have a mount yet and I’m so envious when people jump once or twice to get to the vista while I run around like a headless chicken looking for the entrance &lt;.&lt;. Maybe one day, one day.
---
WvW does not scale your equipment like PvP does - it uses your "normal" (i.e. PvE) gear. Also, you no longer need to look for sigils and amulets for PvP - you can just select the ones you want from the menu and they will apply instead of whatever you have in your own gear.
---
What an amazing video, I'm glad I ran into this. I hope the rest of her videos are like this. Thank you.
---
You're looking for the theif, engineer, and possibly the necromancer. These are the classes where all three of the elite specializations are focused on DPS. (The necromancer when specced into Scourge is a bit more support focused than the others, but you'll not be asked to do anything other than DPS to my knowledge.
---
&gt;t does ascension mean? ho

 [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The\_Ascension](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Ascension)
---
Looks correct, but you missed Winter's Presence shoulders (you can see some snowflakes between the feet; it isn't Winter's Heart since the skin isn't whitened).
---
Though I disagree on the Mystic Chromatic Ooze. That thing darkens the shit out of your armor I've noticed since I got it yesterday. I think that effect on the armor is just the Mistforged shimmer going on, since it isn't on the hat.
---
Likely [[Bond of Faith]](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bond_of_Faith)
---
I'm going for WvW, not PvP.  
---
So there will be no differences between a lvl 1 gear to a lvl 80 with sigil gear, even those +xxx power/precision?
---
Your opening burst isn't all that important. For the fights where that opening burst is important, pretty much every other pDPS beats 37k. Including Necro.
---
But again, doing more damage than people isn't the point. That's ALWAYS been possible on Warrior. Nothings changed here, other than now their DPS focused spec does less damage than the old best BS spec. I would constantly top DPS on BS. Hell, I out damage people on my Necro all the time, doesn't mean it's the best class to pick for raids.
---
There is a difference between viable and meta. Every class in the game is viable. Every class can do enough damage to clear all the content in the game. That was never something Warrior couldn't do. We are talking about meta though. To be the best choice, to be meta, your class has to offer something that's better than all the other classes.
---
For Warrior, that's not damage. Now more than anything. To get Warrior to the point where it is only picked for it's damage it would need about 40k sustained DPS. While pDPS does have a slight buff going for it now, it's still nothing special. Sure a good Warrior will out DPS an awful Thief, but that's always how things worked. The only difference now is that I have to give up my banners and still do mediocre damage.
---
They should be craftable with blade shards tbh, but considering they’re from that gem store drop, I doubt Anet would left us craft them
---
I would say Boonbeast stay as own of the better Dullist Builds in PvP
---
In WvW, there _will_ be differences. PvP scales your gear to level 80. WvW does not, it uses your PvE gear as it is. That means you need level 80 gear with the right stats, runes and sigils.
---
I used Levvi's detector, so I'm fine. :)
---
no one deals 40k sustained dps. just saying. and im very well aware of what meta means.
---
Yes we will its confirmed we get a new legendary weapon every living world episode and the greatsword is the last generation 2 legendary.
---
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
---
I use power soulbeast in T4 fracs and open world both. As another poster said, you just have to use your dodges intelligently, (both the constant ones and the skill dodges/blocks) and unlike fractals, if you need to take a bit of heat off of yourself, you can unmerge to make your pet tank a bit. For that, I would recommend taking a bear as your secondary pet so you can use their high health pool, toughness, and Co do cleanse to your advantage.
---
Make sure to also sprinkle your stuns in there to avoid attacks from mobs that can be CCed freely.
---
Feel free to shoot any more questions my way. Been maiming ranger since GW1.
---
No, but it was stated we'd get one every episode starting from S3E2 (the only exception was S3E6 which gave us two weapons and a trinket), and the last one left is greatsword.
---
The reason we got two with S3E6 was no doubt because we didn't get one in S3E1, so I wouldn't expect two weapons with S4E6. But we should also get a trinket to go along with Aurora, something to drag players back into every S4 map (and maybe some PoF ones).
---
So, where can I go to get that WvW gear? I'm now searching on google for more information about the subject.
---
Sounds like that's exactly whats going on to me.
---
Burn.
---
No people have worked it out because its the last gen 2 legendary to release.
---
You can always use more tower defense.
---
There is no special "WvW gear". Your normal PvE gear _is_ your WvW gear. You can get it from anywhere in the game that gives you gear - reward tracks, vendors, crafting, bosses, fractals, any gear you find anywhere in the game can be used in WvW.
---
Righteously so.
---
Which is why mesmer &amp; thief are so much better.
---
You cannot dodge insane burst if you cannot see the person due to stealth.
---
I think Thief has the least options for support across all classes, so they are the most pure dps. And yet, there are some wacky boon support builds for Thief in raids.
---
Assuming you mean bloody roar: afaik it does work.  
---
Tried it with just axe AA in berserk and the dmg was increased by 20%.
---
Agreed its a lovely skill that adds loads of freedom.
---
The only change I really wish for is that "Bond of Faith" wouldn't be right next to "Bond of Vigor"... the number of times I've ham-fistedly activated Faith as well as Vigor + wasted the 60s recharge...
---
Looks really cool!
---
I don't think I can imagine what it could feel like for you. I did 100% map completion before mounts and it was tedious, sure, but also rewarding and immersive. It was challenging but fun. There never was an easier option to go with so we did it on foot.
---
Nowadays if there is a daily jumping puzzle I just cheese it with a mount and get over it like a grocery check list. What I'm saying is that you don't have hurry to escape the situation you are in now, because it is genuine fun you are having. Mounts are really well done and they are great fun indeed. And while unlocking mounts gives you a whole new aspect of the game, using them will also take away the slow-burn slow-pace aspect. See you in Tyria and have fun!
---
I'm not saying anyone does. I'm saying that's pretty much what Warrior would need to do to get a meta spot from damage alone.
---
Right now there are classes that get close to that, and still offer utility. This is why we are seeing the down tick in fights be labeled as meta for thief. 36k DPS isn't even good enough, just because there's other classes that can do that, or do around that, and offer utility. Even the fights Rifle DE can reliably hit 38k+ on, speed runners still don't consider that good enough to take over a class that brings utility.
---
That is what I'm trying to say. Warrior will never have a meta build that isn't BS just because it doesn't remotely do enough damage. It's DPS builds are selfish and underperforming.
---
It's still perfectly viable, but for speed runs why would you ever pick a Warrior over Thief or pChrono? Or condi Warrior over Mirage or Rev? You wouldn't.
---
This patch didn't change anything that wasn't already true for Warrior. Only now it's best spec does less damage. Warrior already had a hard to use pDPS spec that could do 32k. Now it just has another, at the cost of our cDPS doing worse. This patch didn't really change anything except make the class harder to play. Warrior always had access to specs that did over 30k.
---
I have 5k hours and get the same feeling.
---
5 - Portlander. I need this asap lol
---
So it doesn’t put you in your WvW build?
---
I'm not sure about that actually. I've just seen people from different servers there.
---
Berserker is probably the purest DPS spec. It doesn't do anything BUT damage and all of its traits focus on either buffing its damage (power or condi) or its survivability. 
---
It's all burst DPS though, which isn't exactly always great for PvE encounters, but it can make for some cheesy fun in competitive modes.
---
Better yet: a keybind
---
Weirdly, it does put you in your WvW build, but it defaults to showing you the PvE dailies.
---
&gt; The most they've ever officially announced
---
Source? If you're gonna throw numbers out *you* should at least find a source and prove it.
---
Guilds are where you would most likely be getting raid training from. Many guilds organize weekly raid trainings for those wishing to dip their toes in, and learn some raid bosses. Some guilds also have fractal statics, or raid statics, where its the same group of individuals pursuing specific end-game content to take the occasional stupidity out of pugging.
---
 Pls no.
---
Haha, like I said, new player here so I don't know what that is but I'm planning to find out
---
Can I do it low level? How many hours of work does the scarf take to get?
---
For Fractals your better choice is Guardian by far.
---
Guardians are the better Healer/ Boonsupporter and have better DPS.
---
It's really funny but thats exactly the reason why Revenants are picked as the healer in a Firebrigade composition, because they deal like half or a third of a Guardians damage but heal like a Druid so that's well enough.
---
If you want a sailsafe healer to carry PUGs with and allways top of your teams healthbar you better go Healbrand, all that Aegis, Stability, Reflection, Protection and passive healing really shines.
---
Guardians have access to four different roles since they can bring condition (Firebrand) and power (Dragonhunter) dps, have access to a support and healer role for Firebrand can be played as Quickbrand with fullzerk and Healbrand with Minstrel. Quickbrand is a really cheap supporter wich does not need another set besides zerk so you effectively gear both Dragonhunter and Quickbrand.
---
Revenant can be played as support Alacrigade with Diviner Set, as well as Healrene with  Harrier Set. Healrene are more Boonsupporter than Healers so don't expect your team to be able to facetank mechanics as you could with a Scourge or Healbrand.
---
Revenant has also access to a solid condition spec but the damage is lackluster and needs to ramp up like your usual condition spec. Power Revenant is an absolute meme in PvE so don't even bother - if you want to do so better stick as diviner support.
---
I'd rather not discuss the reason this wasn't working because it implies I'm stupid, which I am. (it's a reshade for a different game that was just sitting ambiguously in my downloads folder and I picked wrong.) Good news is editing the DoF values totally fixed it and now I can use it. So thanks.
---
Is this precisely not *the* design intent for warrior though? It's a master of weapons class, and so the weapon skills take the focus. *Every* weapon that the warrior can wield in one hand, it can dual wield, for example. Also banners are the most impactful for two relatively minor game modes (raids and fractals), whereas there is arguably quite some room to play with utilities in sPvP, WvW and all the rest of PvE, with varying levels of skill cap. In short, I think it's really not thought about with *damage utilities* in mind, unlike almost every other class (fortunately, it's a fresh change of pace to play warrior). But then again, your OP is very strictly wrong, the class is **not** designed around the use of banners at all, no class has been designed around their utilities, only through their unique "F" skills, and you can't use any one game mode exclusively to make such a bold claim.
---
Also I have no idea *why* is this even a problem. Are you saying that it's bad that you have a fixed, constant slot in basically every single raid boss and fractal, because you bring unparalleled utility as offensive support class? Why is it bad? Why don't you think we should drop quickness and alacrity and allow Chronos to be a DPS class? or drop healing and go back to the old dungeon DPS meta? I'm failing to see the logic here, the design space is not only there but is already occupied, there's quite the variety of utilities you can bring with any one Warrior spec and still make solid damage (more than enough to complete any raid, for certain). I think you're talking about *meta* and mistakenly assuming a meta composition is flexible/varied: it's not, there is only one, *the* meta composition, at any time.
---
what?
---
It is perfect place to do some dueling or even gvg (you can fight outside the arena, basically all around the bastion, but not inside (gates have barrier that stops people in combat mode)), it is actually absolutely gorgeous place....and yes, you can just swap instances when in party with other people, server does not matter. 
---
Personally I don't regret getting this pass, but it's true I had only Elon one so far, so this one (outside of map so you can do port in-&gt; port back where you have been) did not competed with others for me yet :)
---
I can't take these ratboys seriously because as neat as they look and as cool as their concept of underground mole-people is, every single one of them sounds like an accountant and it's just so jarring.
---
Are you from Sweden?
---
here's a holo that really moves:permanent swiftness+juggernaut builds and Sigil of stamina, switch to flame thrower and outwalk mechanics for pve
---
Rata Sum*
---
Commander shouts "evil to the left" and they both run right.
---
Dunno if you'd really want to nail one of both I'd go with Necro since its a class with more utility compared to Thief wich can only dps.
---
In WvW Necros are center and core of the Meta for zergs, no way around it - Scourges are just too cancerous to deal with in blops.
---
In PvE Fractals and Raids Necros have a solid Healer role to fill, also their Power dps and Condition dps is nice allthought you might get some snide remarks from randoms because in PvE Necros were undertuned for a long time, like half a decade, so it sticks with people and they might look at you funny. Just beware there might be some cowards out there who will look extra closely on their dps meters.
---
Thiefes in WvW and PvP have their role as sideline roamer, you don't find them as much in big zergs since their toolkit is better for duping around solo.
---
In PvE its a dps class so it competes with literally every other class in the game for a spot in a group, there are Raidbosses where Steal-Thiefes are really cool for specific boons they can pilfer but other than that they bring no further utility wich differentiates them greatly from other DDs. Maybe their UltPoison is Unblockable, but so are Warrior Attacks too, maybe they have a smokescreen to absorb projectiles but Guardian and Mesmer bubbles not only absorb they reflect too!
---
Your damage as thief is kinda comparable to dps Warrior or Reaper, its not as bursty so not as good in endgame compared strong burst classes like Soulbeast, Weaver maybe Holosmith and Dragonhunter.
---
The issues with the no downed state and if this was to be something that was always a part of WvW is the insane damage that flies around in. The condi damage is stupid and the power damage on some classes is flat out dumb and the 500000000 cc skills each profession have i just don't get.
---
It is not even monday and i am bored of this week. Enemies drop dead like flies and you are frustrated that you don't even have a chance to tag them. And because of the damage that flies around there are no real fights, just very boring push and 10 sec later (if that) it is settled, and enemies comes back a few times and then give up and leave.
---
So IF it was to stay in WvW a overhaul a BIG damage and cc overhaul should be done. And i dont mean a overhaul were you add more cc to counter the cc, or more condi cleanses to counter conditions but a reduction of it all to a point were it get interesting again.
---
Love!
---
Pretty much every class has a few utility/trait variants that can help you survive/perform in open world. Just pick whichever one  you want and start looking into their defensive utilities/traits and self-boon sources for open world.
---
There shouldn't be any open world content that you have trouble surviving on with a full-damage build (save difficult group events/metas), as most of the game is designed around killing stuff as fast as possible to reduce damage taken and the added bonus of dodging completely negating damage.
---
The weapon? Levvi‘s thingy (don‘t know english rn)
---
As long none of u 2 is called Brie , in good. Oh snap...
---
I don't know her.
---
Warrior builds - I've been playing for 4 months now, I love playing spellbreaker, it's super fun but now with the Zerker changes I'm not sure what to do. I do open world/Raids/Fractals not sure what to run where. Right now I have Fully asc zerker armor/trinkets running Axe/Dagger &amp; Dagger/Axe as SPB. Any assistance would be appreciated.
---
Thanks :)
---
Copy that. 
---
I'm hoping it's just an insufficient balance issue on the card that hasn't reflected yet. Might as well pay my bill later too.
---
I think this works:

No one said JUST dps... No class are JUST dps.
---
The ability to go jackal pounce-&gt;teleport jump-&gt;bond of faith and fly half a mile in a second is nice, too.
---
You can't just say "yea but I beat someone better than me because of build counters" and call it an argument. You might as well just say "no ur wrong" and save on words.  
---
What was the class match up. What were the builds being used. Why do you think one counters the other? Do you know the opponent? Fought them before with a different match up? How do you know a player you beat was actually better than you?
---
Reading and comprehension not a strong suit huh?
---
&gt;If you weren't being 'forced' into banners or physical or rage skills  you would be running, what, two signets and a break bar skill?  Such  gameplay.
---
Daredevil wants to say Hi ! But instead of two signets we run 3 !
---
Where do I get ascended accessories with Diviner's stats?
---
I think the whole idea of "slaying" potions and sigils was discontinued, so a-net will be fine with the supply of last widely used one naturally running out.
---
See, I want this as my HP train commander. I'm never gonna lose track of him amongst a full party
---
also shows mastery level, not wvw rank
---
While I don't have a specific guild to recommend, you should totally check out  [https://www.reddit.com/r/guildrecruitment/](https://www.reddit.com/r/guildrecruitment/)
---
Can't thief also reliably give max might to a group, along with the strongest cc in the game?
---
I hope they re-enter supply one day. They were useful because they gave +15% exp instead of 10%.
---
He is a cruel Monkey, but we can always count on him to be consistent.

uwu
---
So much sarcasm in the comments, well it's justified. 
---
LS episodes were used to bring new legendary weapons since LS3 started and the Greatsword *IS* the last gen 2 legendary left, so yes we will get it with episode 6. 
---
Also there won't be gen 2 underwater legendaries. Anet said this when they announced gen2 legendaries back then.
---
Actually, [it __does__ have to do with code.](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/57537/why-cant-we-dye-back-items) As the dev says in that link, backpacks and weapons are considered "items", while armor is considered "composite". I think these are likely different classes in the code, so if you just change a backpack to be "composite" you're probably gonna run into a bunch of issues with undefined functions and variables. He also mentions that they'd have to re-do the textures for literally *every* backpack to make it work with the current dye system. 
---
He doesn't say anything about the amount or size of packets being sent to/from the server. It may have initially been designed as such (with dyes only being for armor and not for weapons/backpacks) to deal with server limitations, but it seems like the limitation now is the fact that they have 6 years of code that assumes backpacks are the way they are.

Love this game's style of making movement and travel a primary progression path. Makes free flight games like WoW a bit boring to move around in by comparison.
---
That's for raids. Getting legendary armor in the first set of raids had no baring on the legendaries we got in PvE.
---
PvP titles are about as good at Raid titles. They can be an indication of skill, but raid selling and win trading have diminished their value.  
---
Also, if you're saying scrapper matches up poorly against condi mirage that's news to me. I think I've lost to a condi mirage 1v1 maybe once this patch. Power chronos are a tougher match-up, but only if you let them get their spike damage off for free. The only time "counters" matter to me is when deciding whether or not I want to fight 1v2, 1v3, 1v4 scenarios, and what my target priority will be.  
---
But counters is a silly term because nothing truly counters anything, unless you're running a sub-optimal build. "Checks" is a better term for it.
---
Didnt they nerfed it to the ground with latest patch?
---
🤷🏻‍♂️ that’s why I’m asking
---
Harrier's Herald
---
Does being in the bastion make your wvw participation decay?
---
I would like if they give the potions the slaying sigil treatment. A general buff for everything and an additional greater buff for a special kind of enemy.
---
I'm pretty sure gw2e does it via data snapshots of the data for your wallet, inventory, bank, &amp; material storage, and then shows the delta in your wallet/inventory.
---
My hair irl are that colour, i ve taken it to the next level lul
---
Once I got a GM to respond it still took about 5 days to get everything resolved.
---
I only drive on mesmer for the pulls.  I'm of the opinion that when driving you don't play your class super efficiently and we're better off having someone dedicated to being a firebrand being the firebrand.  I feel like beyond the pulls Mesmer does nothing for the group since they nerfed boonsharing and increasing the duration of boons doesn't do anything if they get corrupted.  You give some stab, I use it selfishly though.  I like driving on the class regardless.  There is a lot of nonsense you can get away with via portals, veils, pulls, etc.  If I didn't like it I simply wouldn't play it.
---
I wouldn't really recommend taking a chronomancer as a pick in a dedicated guild comp on the basis that they do nothing outside of pulls, but since the commander doesn't play as efficiency anyways I think it's okay, but I understand why they aren't as common as a pick as firebrands.  When I'm not commanding I'm a spellbreaker main.
---
Socialize.

They're all bottoms

Its currently the case for Druid + BannerSlave anyways though.
