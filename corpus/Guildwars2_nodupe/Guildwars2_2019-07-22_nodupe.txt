It's the curse of non-monospace fonts. :D

Sorry for the bad experiences :(

The Warclaw collection is definitely a pain in the ass. Most of the action is in the evening hours of your WvW server - if you're on a mostly German server check out when they are at 6 in the evening (most ppl start around this time because they got home from work). Weekends are also prime time, especially Friday and Saturday evenings. Just keep at it honestly, at some point your server has to capture a keep.
---
As for the language barrier, if they ppl on your server aren't willing to include you, it would be best to change your WvW server. The price depends on how active the server is in WvW, the lower server costs 500 gems to convert to and the highest 1800 gems. Some servers can't be selected at all because they're full (what ever that means to Anet). 
---
What country are you from if you don't mind me asking? Maybe we can find out which server would be best for you.
---
To me, gw2 has a lot of meaning.
---
First: it gives me quality time with my favourite sibling that already moved out.  My older brother brought me into the game and taught me how to jump any jp there is. He is my role model since I was little and I played gw2 mostly because I wanted to spend more time with him. However he stopped playing approximately a year after I got into it, which made me really sad at first, but now every time he visits or he logs in for some JP-afk-mesmer time I can tell him about all the cool stuff I did in gw2 and we can talk for hours about it. 
---
Second: it makes it possible for me to let my mind wander. I often have very stressful weeks because of school and with gw2 I can relax at the end if the day.
---
Third: gw2 opened another community for me. Not the in-game community, I'm talking about the Instragram-Gw2 community  (which is really big imo and worth checking out). I discovered that taking screenshots could actually be part of the endgame and thus I met some amazing people that I ended up inviting to my own guild. So gw2 means a lot to me when it comes to friendship and also leadership. Which leads me to..
---
Fourth: gw2 teaches me. I've been a guild leader for 3 years by now and I've learned so much. I experienced a lot of difficult situations between individuals, I needed to make hard decisions, I needed to realise my own faults and own up to them, I believe it made me a better human in the end. 
---
Generally, it enhanced the quality of my overall life.
---
Oh my apologies, I reposted this from a different subreddit and didn't realise my previous comment wouldn't appear. let me fix that.
---
Just like everybody got bored with the griffon and roller beetle!
---
...Wait.

---
Good  morning Reddit! I'm currently levelling up a newborn Sylvari  Elementalist (seen above) and I'm really loving the look of the  Snapdragon Shirt, but i'm having difficulty pairing it with anything.
---
I'd  love to hear all your feedback on lower body armour (pants / skirts /  whatever) and boots, particuarly ones that would look good in white,  with light blue/green accents.
---
Thanks in advance for your kind help!!
---
I would definitely advice you to start a new character and play for a while on that since quite a lot of things have changed. Once your comfortable with the gameplay, feel free to switch to your high-level characters and try the lvl 80 maps to get a feel for it.
---
What type of gameplay do you enjoy the most? Maybe we can figure out which class would suit you.
---
I’m glad it enhanced your life! It’s amazing how much games can positively affect us!
---
The Wiki states that 7 Golems are neaded to stun the Claw of Jormag.
---
Ehhh... At this point it's more of a resurrection if she ever comes back into the game. God knows why Anet won't just kill her off. I swear that company is being run by cats, seeing as how many open plot threads they keep dangling around.
---
I really didn't think a game can have such an effect but I was wrong obviously. Of course gw2 also has it's dark sides. Being a guild leader and all I am often I involved in ridiculous drama between people, but I see it as an annoying challenge that will be over in no time. Compared to the positive things this game has brought me I can live with that little bit of drama.
---
Whats the difference then? 
---
Elite Specs are features. Mounts are Features. New map is kind of a given. Maybe they will even think of a new feature like in the other two Expansions. All of this is also content worthy of an expansion though. The two are, in this context, interchangeable
---
I've used it several times as well!
---
This patch introduced some giant outliers with all those weaver builds
---
Hey she likes to watch
---
I understand that, but at least there’s Druid for you! That’s the only healer like class I can think of at the moment..
---
Save your fireworks,  annoy them back with a constant light show
---
What I mean by all of this is that you don't form the same bonds without overcoming a challenge together, shoving rainbows up eachother's asses is not a community lmao it's a circlejerk. But you know this and you try to ignore it. Feel free to attempt to belittle the importance or actual meaning of what I'm saying.
---
Not really emotional at this point as I've said in my other posts here - I've already quit and I'm not planning on coming back even if Arenanet pull off a dozen miracles.
---
I find you utterly ludicrous. Do you even exist? Are you even a real person?
---
&gt;I understand that, but at least there’s Druid for you! That’s the only healer like class I can think of at the moment..
---
Elementalist and Revenant can heal, but it seems like raiding in GW2 is all focused on having a druid over any other healer :-/.
---
I would not buy any gems from g2a: so many of them are made with fraudulent credit card purchases that the likelihood you get bad gems are VERY high, or that your account gets banned later.
---
Flying mounts need to fuck off and die. They ruin every single fucking game.
---
&gt; I can see it now...all minions die when you go into reapers shroud.
---
There's already a non-zero chance that will happen.. it also happens when you're transformed when chasing the skritt.
---
So one thing to note from SC's list there is that boon herald is very niche and not meta, hand kite is for one boss specifically (Deimos) but can run the same gear as the heal renegade build. Condition DPS renegade is a strong build on some specific fights (Dhuum, Cairn, Mat) and decent everywhere else that isn't a power focused boss like CA or KC. Heal/Alacrity renegade provides alacrity to a group running a firebrand (or two) that are covering quickness and the combo replaces a chrono. It's getting more common but needs the other half to correctly cover boons. If you were only able to gear one you can try to learn the DPS build (rotation was pretty hard to do well but I think it's gotten easier with the last patch, haven't gotten a chance to try it out again) or one of the alacrity renegade builds. Check [this guide on how to get gear for them](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character) since they all want expansion armor.
---
You have a hard time comprehending simple English, don't you?
---
G2A is CRAP. There have been so many horror stories about theft and fraud. Just buy the gems in game or Walmart.
---
Isn't that verdent brink?
---
They sell those at my local walmart.  2000 gem ones, so I buy those ocassionally when I dont want to commit to 2400
---
Ryne best girl/impute smh
---
I think part that feeds into that is that the end of LS4 had a nice, feel good "THE END" moment, without setting up anything for the future. They could, in theory, end the game tomorrow and have told a complete story.
---
My personal thought is that they are going to have LS5 as the "beyond" of GW2, before deciding if they want to come out with GW3 or not.
---
Level 80? You might have already collected enough resources to start crafting 1 linen shirt. (I dunno though. You might have to farm a bit more...)
---
I wonder how they would feel if they were banned in the US and China.
---
The opinions I'm stating are indeed that of the hardcore community, most of them are just too pussy to say it.
---
Take a look around in hc guild's discords and the last year hardcore players' steams (not even the streamers themselves, the chat says plenty). They all feel like this.
---
Although, I quit two weeks ago - my opinion is still very valid. 
---
10,000 hours actively playing the game is no small number.
---
That said, I can understand your point.
---
Skritt, I'm hit!

is it possible to convert Li back to LD?
---
I’m happy I wasn’t. I’m surprised they aren’t pumping out more expansions.
---
Not unless you killed a boss in Wing 5 before they added LD. If you did they you can change a maximum of 168 LI to LD, otherwise it only works LD -&gt; LI. See this old post: https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/54756/a-note-about-future-raid-rewards
---
I mean, we basically have our own trinity in places where it matters (Raids).
---
You need a tank to draw aggro (for the fights that aren't random target), a Quickness source, Alacrity source, and a Banner slave.
---
yeah but it’ll be l e g e n d a r y

---
Yep. I've used it several times. Saved me so much time and hassle. 
---
In general, anything which only asks for an api key is legit. The devs structured the api system knowing players would want things Anet wouldn't have the time or ability to do while also working on the game, so they came up with the api key system. In your account settings you find a section dedicated to api keys; here you can generate and delete these keys as needed. These keys grant read only access to specific parts of your account, and you can choose which parts you want the key to include.

---
I'd argue GW2 has some of the most average combat, at best.
---
GW1, on the other hand, had _amazing_ combat. I'm glad I got to experience that in its heyday.
---
Depending on the content you play I would recommend a stat called trailblazer. 
---
It will give you toughness, condition damage, expertise, and vitality. With those stats you will be able to dish out some decent condi damage while still being fairly durable. 
---
If you have Path of Fire, the mirage specialization is pretty good for condi builds with the scepter weapon, but either way you can definitely make it work with core mesmer or chronomancer.
---
Chrono is dead in pve open world (solo). It's tedious and a chore in metas now.
---
So there's that...
---
The difference is that PoF is an expansion, and we’ve known for a while now that they haven’t had a team working on another
---
Trailblazer condi mirage should work fine for you. Mirage dodge doesnt displace you at all and trailblazer stats grant damage and survivability. Dont bother about infusions, they are irrelevant abd used only by people who want to top their performance. Full infusions is like 2-3% of damage increase.
---
That's why I do it. Wish I could 11111 from my skyvory tower
---
God forbid the only remaining relevant condition spec in the game after they gutted condi renegade (the hardest spec to play) while retarded deadeyes and daredevils are autoattacking their way to victory with a few burst skill spams here and there.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The fact they've been nerfing condi specs into total irrelevance courtesy of pvp despite all their drawbacks in PvE compared to power specs is reason enough to leave mirage alone considering it's the only spec you can justify playing if you prefer condi specs and won't benefit from epidemic bouncing gimmicks (not even going to go into the fact of necromancer, supposedly being touted as the master of conditions by Anet before vanilla GW2 release in previews and reddit AMA's ended being the weakest condi dps spec in the game).
---
Yeah, let's nerf mirage alongside power chrono so mesmers can be mediocre not only as a support spec, but in the condition and power dps roles as well.
---
Is worth the qol I have 1 set as of today for medium armour I just pass it around and reuse sigils.
---
Aurene's arc is complete but there are still 3 dragons the commander has to beat up!
---
There's absolutely no reason to play support chrono with how trivially ren/fb get boons out by comparison. I virtually autoattack for 2-3 seconds on my renegade and provide my group with permanent alacrity and 15 might stacks while doing ridiculous healing on top and the quickbrand is braindead quickness on top of both of them having significantly higher DPS.
---
At least chrono took finesse to justify all those boons on top of the fact it had abysmal damage.
---
1. Making an elite spec better in some regards and weaker in others when compared to the base class is not bad game design. It's what was always supposed to be there( remember the no-power creep promise before hot?), but for the most part weren't because new things need to be shiny and exciting.
---
2. Yes Especs should radically change the way a class plays and usually change its interaction with the core class mechanic in a meaningful way, but your formulaic suggestion is terrible. When each edpec gives me exactly 5 new shrouds kills for necro, 1 new adrinalin skill per weapon on war, 4 new shatters on mesmer... That and exactly that(plus 1 utility at, 1 weapon and 1 trait line of course) .. I would be way less excited by new elites pecs.
---
3. You wondered aloud why mir rage didn't get new shatters, since those are the class mechanics of mesmer. The answer is simple: they are just part of the mesmer class mechanic of illusions. Traditionally dmg had been loaded into phantsms, while clones were fuel for shatters. Mirage turns this around and loads dmg into clones, quite the significant change.
---
Base guardian's class skills are very basic compared to what Dragon Hunter and Firebrand, and the elite specs add more effects, not remove or disable parts of the base class entirely. You even keep the passive abilities of each skill. You'd have to go into detail about what trade-offs the spec has, because I'm not convinced.
---
that's rough, I feel for you. here in Australia what gem cards remain at brick and mortar store are $25AUD, if u bought from the gem store with conversion rates you would nearly pay $50AUD.  that is not a little loss, that's paying for 2 gem cards
---
https://youtu.be/RPxvTd_jCPQ
---
start from 15:38
---
I don't like how low some of those people are getting just from the damage of the boss aura ticks. Makes me feel like the build sits firmly in that awkward spot where the healing it does isn't really worth the damage it loses and you're better off taking something else. I guess it might be okay as a secondary healer for low-pressure fights?
---
There is a seller on eBay that sends you the codes via email. I think the username is wildgamers3. Not sure if he/she sells individual gem codes but he sells 5 x2000 gem cards for $75. A decent chunk of change but you’re essentially saving $50. I’ve bought from this seller multiple times and have never had an issue.
---
Basically each time you die doing a JP, Aurene dies... riiiiight...
---
Hey, I'm not sure if it's feasible, but would it be possible to link markers to achievements? It would be a neat way to automatically hide (and keep hidden) any markers signifying completed steps. 
---
Ex. When doing collections where each item is a separate entry in an achievement, collecting that item would permanently hide the marker it's assigned to. It would be especially useful for, say, the Skyscale achievements.
---
GW2 is WvW for me. I can get my dose of raids and micro pvp on elsewhere but not in WvW. I love the story updates too. Once I had to tell the story to someone else, it's actually hard to put it in a short summary without losing so much spirit.
---
Not really.. it's a terrible analogy.  Technically true that a computer can 'store' a limited size of number but in this example a 32-bit unsigned integer is hardly the limit.
---
They are fundamentally different skills. That is the trade off.
---
That's not true. With each release of content they put a lot of focus on what is monetisable sure, but there is plenty of other content made and included to bring people in! New collections and achievements are a given with each new episode and they're used to unlock Tons of things!
---
It’s just a visual bug, slow down their cowboy
---
I turned all my character model limits down to low/super low. Really helps with the too-much-stuff-on-my-screen problem.

You can download a program called voiceattack to bind spells to voice commands

They likely meant to refer to the event you have to complete if the djinn are not there, where you must defeat the Grandmaster Elder Djinn.
---
Same, only thing I've found to work in the past is forcing myself to talk to people doing the same activities. As with anything, it gets better with frequent practice; the hard part is consistency when you don't feel like being social.
---
Ahh, okay, I just have to wait for an event, then. Thank you! :) I haven't spent much time in Vabbi besides map completion.
---
Didn’t hear about it... But i noticed that less and less people on my friendliest play.
---
If you are even slightly active in the raid scene most hardcore guilds are dead or dying, and even many casual to high end statics are struggling to fill. Rehashing world boss rush within a month of introducing the event isn't going to keep people engaged.
---
&gt;  feels like MMORPGs are in a slow and protracted decline.

It does seem that way. Doesn't seem to be any interesting new ones coming out either.

I disliked FF XIV personally. I'm sure it's a fine game, but it's not my game. I don't think there's some kind of mass exodus though. Maybe for raiders, who weren't going to be happy here long term anyway. This is not a game primarily designed around raids. 
---
But then, I couldn't play a game designed around a quest hub system period. 
---
Saying that a game that's available on both console and computer is doing well, that has had 13 games in the same franchise before the current game, that has a movie out under the same name is doing well, sort of expected anyway.
---
This game is not appealing to the same playerbase for the most part anyway. I'm okay with raiders going to that game. It's fine. What's the issue?
---
I just find group finders to kill any discussion that may be had in most games. Get in, get out, talk as little as possible. I think I’m also nervous I’ll fuck it up.
---
I left both GW2 and WoW for FFXIV. It was worth it. I would come back to GW2 for another expansion with a new class and/or new elite specs but the Living World doesn't do it for me.
---
Eh. Yes, people are getting vocal because of lack of content and not much recent communication. And yeah, FFXIV is in a good place because of their very recent expac. 
---
But that's not out of the ordinary. I don't see a "mass migration", and I doubt Anet see one either. 
---
Remember, the forums and subreddits attract an - often vocal - minority.
---
You have joined this game not for the game itself, but as your personal special snowflake care center? For the "nice community" of people going full turboautist, as soon as something goes against them, or something just clicks in their brains?
---
Yes, this is exactly what  I'm talking about.
---
Interesting. Do you have a link to the build?
---
That’s real interesting as the game was ported to 64bit a long time ago. You’d have thought most of the assets would have been changed to be 64 bit also.
---
Gw2 used to be amazing but they’ve continued to muck up story and game over multiple years. Lore is great but their writer are making stuff up now that contradicts established lore from gw1. 
---
The living world was a incredible idea but now it’s just a damn template. New zone, currency, mastery, and poorly written story. 
---
I loved the world anet created and the music one by far my favorite part of the gw world.
---
Always gave this site out to people when running a guild. It’s a good resource.
---
FFXIV is growing, they recently said they have the highest number of subscription ever. It is not my type of game but seems everyone like new expansion.
---
I have been doing all the PvE content pretty much. Never got hooked on WvW.
---
PvP was kinda cool though when I played a couple matches but, you know... I am afraid of losing I guess ;-)
---
I guess I would like something versatile, usuable in a variety of content if possible, if that's not so simple, maybe something that is on the lower spectrum of difficulty in terms of rotation and does not require me to play piano with my skills. But honestly I am quite open so something fun in general.
---
TacO, run chest route. Should get 250 after doing that six times, I think? It's not that bad.
---
Hey!
---
...
---
Yeah, you're right...
---
Well for me first of all it's my previous MMORPG. I sometimes still log in, especially to finish each new story segment, but by and large I only play FF14 nowadays. However even that I play quite little so if anything I'm off MMOs at this point in time.
---
As far as what GW2 is if I had to elevator pitch it, it's an incredibly casual-friendly MMORPG with a strong focus on exploration and freeform character customization. It suffers a bit from a host of unrealized potential plus lack of care applied after release leading to a few underlying balance and systems issues. However, when playing it for its strengths (open world content), then that has virtually no impact so it only affects the areas the game is already weaker in anyhow, like high-end PvE or its PvP modes.
---
Overall? It's the **perfect** filler/timewaster game. But it's nothing more than that.
---
Imagine the fun once they realize that most of the specs are not viable for endgame stuff.
---
Source: Me, an innocent Paladin back in 2004.
---
As a developer, I'll take this as a compliment.
---
And when FFXIV is in a bit of a slower moment and something new occurs in GW2 it will be another "mass migration" back here. Business as usual.
---
a loving memory from someone that's no longer in my life that I can use to make new ones
---
Ah, I so feel for you) when I first started playing GW2 I was so painfully shy and awkward...l wished to do things together with people, but was afraid to even offer my company to anyone, cause it was my first experience with MMO, and as a perfectionist I was really really anxious about being such a dummy about everything in MMO games 🤦🏻‍♀️😅
---
Turns out I was dummy about being a dummy))
---
So, what helped me and what I would advice you, since you’re asking for advices - I googled for guilds (idk if guilds are keeping their own websites these days though 😅) and found a tiny one, which claimed they were going for personalities rather then for amount of players, they wanted new members to write an introduction on their forum board, so the rest of the community could already find something out about a newcomer.  So I did, was accepted, was invited in guild’s teamspeak, and was just sitting there very silent after some first “hello’s” and “howdy’s”, just listening, wishing to talk, but being too awkward and frightened for that 😅 
---
But then it turned out guys were friendly and funny, then one day day some of them were searching for people to go to fractals or smth (here’s the main problem of small guilds, having to search for people to do things x)), I forced myself to say I’d love to, but I have no clue about fractals or whatever it was, and they just took me in and showed me the whole new game. And boy, the amount of fun we had through the years of playing...))  we made friends quite fast after that, and it just wasn’t so difficult to converse to whoever, after this first step was made.
---
Such a novel I wrote, sorry for rambling x))
---
anyway, point is that small guilds are easier for socially awkward us, people there usually bond better and also lack of new blood, so they’d try to engage you in conversation, which you seem to have troubles doing on your own. Also, in my experience, chances are much slimmer to find toxic Mighty Fathers of PVE there, which adds to the atmosphere.  
---
And then, my personal trick I used when being young and awkward even in relationship with my IRL close friends - I just forced myself to talk. Sometimes it was taking hours of just trying to push that first word out, but once the first word was said there was no way back, I had to keep saying what I was saying, and surprisingly (not really) people were mostly up to talking. 
---
I still have some awkwardness left, but it’s nothing compared to what it was some years ago, so you just have to work for it...to be honest, I actually think that being a decent human being  requires constant work on your own character, irl or in game, so just take it as another goal))
---
And ignore aggressive or passive-aggressive people...just like that, you can’t escape from them, they will always be around, but it’s your choice to not mind them, and not deal with them.
---
Good luck there, I’m pretty sure you’ll manage! Guild wars is a very friendly game, especially if you don’t read Reddit 😅 
---
PS. And sorry for my grammar, just in case, English isn’t my first language, so I’m never too sure))

It’s true, it’s just my opinion and my own social circle. My static is playing both GW2 and FF14 now, my wvw (SEA time is ded), and even when I pug CMs+T4s this group of friends talked about FF14 - this is the trigger which got me looking into FF14 hahaha

It's been on the todo for a while, but the text input in TacO is quite unreliable (very hard to make it work in a way that it doesn't interfere with GW2) so I'm still trying to figure out the best way to do it.

Yeah, I find the flapping really hard on my eyes and I generally move away from anyone idling in the air.
---
Not surprising. FF XIV just dropped a massive expansion in the middle of a huge downtime in GW2, and quite a few content creators are picking it up. People go where the action is.

A fantasy world that i always wish i could be in and escaped this dreary reality. So many different species to play and interact with (Sylvari and Asura Master race!) with their own unique style, lore, and so much more.  
---
Waking up in the dream and fighting nightmares before we even step foot in Tyria, that beautiful view of the The Grove, that music that will always have a special place in my heart, exploring Rata Sum, getting jailed in Rata Sum for exploring too much, hearing about the golem rebellion, that golem chasing the youngster for misbehaving, i lost myself in the game and thoroughly enjoyed myself with everything that happening around myself.  
---
So many hidden things, unexpected events and such all over the world if you just look around. I remember my first time suddenly following players chasing a Skritt and getting turned into a Moa, following a Messenger Golem delivering funny messages and the recipient reactions,  seeing an Asuran Couple first date while the girl's father sent a chaperone golem with them,  seeing players attempting a Jumping Puzzle and failing, tried it and failed while cursing, finally clearing it with no help from anyone, even to this day i still finding these sort of things.  
---
Helping other players, either newbies or veterans with fights, events, or just general information in map chats. Or sending them items to help them getting started.
---
1) BL chests are a (very) minor reward component.
---
2) You can get free BL chest keys by map completion and the weekly key farm.
---
2) Anet already reacted to the random mount licenses, offering more expensive ones where you can choose.
---
3) you can exchange in game currency for premium currency.
---
It seems normal to me. Players who see raiding as their end game might prefer FFXIV or WoW. I don't see any reasons why they don't leave for the most promising MMORPG nowadays. But don't be frustrated, a large part of GW2 player base once were WoW refugees who hated raiding. They probably won't migrate anywhere else.
---
If i remember, we don't actually have to beat the champ elder djinn right? After they spawn, just talk to them to get the collection. Fighting and beating them after is optional?
---
a dev said it once
---
It's because FF14 recently had a huge new cool update which basically reworked every class.
---
Warframe is gonna drop a huge juicy update soon(tm) as well, which will no doubt recall players back to the game.
---
Gw2's Lw content is very bite sized and can be completed in a single month which doesn't offer the same sort of pull.
---
I used to want to keep playing GW2 forever and resist GW3. At this time, I think GW3 is not unacceptable.
---
The font used by the TacO ui is the exact same as the one used by the GW2 client in order to make it integrate more seamlessly. It even changes correctly when you change your GW2 interface size.
---
Xiuquatl, very very slowly because I can't be arsed to farm Elder Wood. 
---
Trying to learn Firebrand support atm, both in WvW and Fractals. Playing FB is WvW is so fun :)
---
Yeah I'm gonna need to find some better hosting for the releases...
---
Guild Wars should update the old maps with anti-air cannons.
---
My favorite part about it is that it has nothing against, you playing world of warcraft, which is an awesome feature ! Now to be honest, i like and will allways say that the mount movement animation is awesome in gw2, otherwise wow is superior in everything
---
Looking at an [external achievement tracker,](https://i.imgur.com/6oxAqp4.jpg) I can definitely see the progress of individual items in achievements. Would it be possible to show/hidemarkers based on this info?
---
That's what I said.
---
VoiceAttack's not perfect, but it's surprisingly good. And if you're patient and skilled, it could totally work for GW2 - someone cleared Dark Souls with it, after all. :P
---
just general gaming, new hotness comes out and people move on for a while, same thing will happen if we get another expansion im sure :)
---
yeahhhhhhhhhhhhh no thanks to big dumb babies: "fire burns" no shit mr male norn char.
---
I'd love a single almost-legendary quality item collection for each dungeon. Make it a cool trophy piece with animations, particles, sounds or whatever. Tie it to a bunch of achievements, gate it behind dungeon currency and go from there. Once you've got the base level add more steps to upgrade and power it up, potentially by visiting other dungeons
---
For example, blast through CoE to assemble a prototype inquest rifle powered by a mix of magic types. First you'd build the physical rifle by stealing the schematics and parts, rewarding you with the base skin and an exotic weapon. Then you'd power it up by charging it at potent sources of magic (aka: other dungeons) which rewards the slightly fancier ascended version. Finally, you take your shiny new toy and calibrate it (by killing some more dungeon bosses) which awards a material which you can lob into the forge with the ascended rifle to get the final (still ascended) version.
---
Anet doesn't really want to promote resellers because they make a lot more money selling gems in game.  There are no approved resellers of gems in the UK.
---
What I've noticed buying gems from cdkeys is that the code you get can take several minutes (sometimes up to 15 mins before it will work in game).  What does that mean?  It means that cdkeys is not selling active gem code keys but inactive ones.  Once you purchase them it electronically notifies Anet's systems that the code has been sold and Anet activates it in their backend systems so you can enter it as a valid code.  Due to latency and communication between their systems this can take several mins which is why you see the delay.  This seems like a good official security system to me but you're entitled to make of it what you will.
---
I just made Bolt and all of the LS4 metas drop volatile magic, which you can use to buy the trophies directly - it works out as 15% cheaper than getting the gold and buying them. 
---
If you get into the habit of doing Dragonfall and maybe Istan and Thunderhead Keep or Sandswept meta events, you basically end up with about half the materials you need as well as enough gold to keep you going. As long as you do that and keep on top of the time-gated materials, it's actually less of a grind than it looks.
---
Well aware of that but hey. It's a good deal and it's worked so far
---
Arenanet has offered discounts but only with ultimate editions of expansions. Offering 4k gems for 50% off. Now if only they had these bundles in the store, like buy 1600 gems for 20 euro's and get 400 extra. The more you buy the more you get sorta thing. But if the price difference is substantial enough for me to save a lot of money in the long run i'll go whichever route is cheapest. No offense to the people that don't but money is money.
---
And also, Arenanet needs to offer a 2k gem bundle because i don't want to buy the 1600 pack and another 800 to get a mount skin. Just let me get 2k in one purchase and don't make me convert the last bit of gold i have on shitty converion rates xD
---
Games been out for 7 years almost, i doubt they still sell them today. Still have a 2k gem card in my closet as a keepsake
---
yeah, before balance scrapper can clear all condis, block all projectiles, block lot of dmg via barrier and deal good dmg. All in one. Was super balanced. LOL
---
and was able to tank couple enemies and fast rez
---
Yup, nothing more than the regular eb and flow of MMOs. Hell I might give FFXIV a try, been wanting to for a while, but bet your ass I'll come back when something new happens here. Or I just feel like playing I suppose.
---
Lots of people went back to WoW for it's expansions too
---
and then came back here again
---
You would have to grind hundreds of hours through initial levels and quests, it is not skippable as in GW2. You either do whole main quest, or you don't lvl up. Or you buy skip but lose all the context for next quests...And everyone says that the juicy stuff is the newest one, so it  is not something one would just go in, enjoy the good stuff and be done. 
---
But whatever, that's the deal with most games that are around for years.
---
But it is so strange. Those Mobas and FPS are totally the same all around years. Nothing new, just grind totally same content again and again. Yes, it gives adrenaline and such probably, but if we complain about not enough new stuff, those game types are not the better ones in that. 
---
Maybe it is because of exactly that though - many people probably just enjoy to just play same shit again and again, with no need to use brain at all. Just that one learned thing....
---
So you agree with me that the majority of the hardcore playerbase has left/are leaving? Ok cool nice talk.
---
For the record since you seem to have a severely short attention span, I have also left the game, typing this junk for 30 seconds at a time on my phone isn't exactly my whole day lol.
---
Why the fuck would I want to boost ego over something as stupid as this infront of people that I clearly have zero respect for? 
---
Answer: I don't, stop trying to create logic where there is none. Good day.
---
the dodge bar has spoiled me for other games. i might be running along in another game and hit the space bar, only to jump a bit on the spot, and i kinda get a bit sour.
---
&gt;All they need to do is focus on creating new content that attracts players.
---
which they dont, so...
---
The new events still need to build up some variety. Just worldbosses and metas won't cut it in long term. I am looking forward for next one, hopefully some totally new kind. That way with good variety it would be a bit different.
---
Also they hinted towards pvp event like this, so one can hope they will actually introduce it :)
---
Truth
---
I'm pretty sure griffon doesn't do that, and yes I'm also annoyed by it cuz I have to press f5 every time I do a raid opening with skyscale engage skill
---
A majority of my friends "tried" FFXIV and I haven't seen them back in a few months, some in years.
---
I'm pretty new to the game. Bought it a while back, played on and off. Level 30 ish now. I'm just going around the map and exploring, but want to make friends, maybe through a guild. Where do I find beginner friendly guilds? Thanks in advance!
---
Found you! Let me know how the gear goes for you
---
Found you! Let me know how the gear goes
---
open world barely counts as content. we need fractals and dungeons with repeatable rewards (not just 1x a day) and with some loooong term goals (token system, achievs). also challenge modes because this game is too braindead easy. and the content needs to be fast paced and engaging, not like molten facility afk fractal or deepstone bridge
---
&gt; suggest me some building tool 
---
[http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/](http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/)
---
It probably will
---
that sounds awesome
---
Fb/ren comp is just a lot more reliable.
---
Well obviously, They just dropped an expansion that got very good reviews.
---
Same shit happens when WoW expansion drops.
---
I'm sure Arenanet are aware they lose players to other games when they add nothing for 3 months at a time.
---
Doesn't seem like it's working.
---
&gt; But after all, it can't beat gw2 in any open world, any meta events, or even raids.
---
I mean it releases raids more than 3x faster than Gw2 and they are significantly harder.
---
I have to confess that I just opened a guide in my browser with a map showing the locations and went to one after another :-/
---
Still better than farming maps for currencies. :-(
---
Of course, if you're using a guide it's really easy. I just deliberately wanted to *not* use one this time, since I've done it often enough in the past, and it was quite the fun experience (for the first collection at least).
---
Currency-wise, luckily I was/am in a position where having invested heavily into my home instance pays off, plus it has been a while since I last played so actively that I need the new LS ascended trinkets or other items, so I could just passively stock up on currencies.
---
Yes  they'll come back for 2 hours to do newest story and go back to what they were doing before. Everyone happy.
---
&gt; Everyone who played at least a bit on all maps had everything for skyscale ready on day one just from supplies.
---
Problem is not everyone is going to comeback and play for a week every 3 months, It's not engaging and the content does not have enough replaybility to last 3 months with 1 map.
---
They're all servicable; they're just not meant for serious higher level play. Which is literally the best they can do without making race matter significantly in character creation, outside lore purposes.
---
If they make the Norn skill as good as, or better than, some other elite skills, then only players who play classes or builds that can benefit from the racial skill benefit--if the norn skill isn't really good for Mirage players, they don't benefit. And of course every race is going to have the same issues, and by the nature of their skills, some are likely to suit different builds better than others. This, in effect, does cause players to have to select race based on what class/builds they want, if they want to be able to use racial skills in endgame content.
---
Then let's say they balance the race skills so that they're not just optimal for one or two builds, but can be subbed in any build. Well now these skills are OP compared to all the normal elite skills, so that's a problem for balancing. Then, because skills of different races are still going to differ, some will still inevitably be better in certain situations than others, still pushing players to pick a race based primarily on their play style.
---
You can still roam around Central Tyria spamming race skills to your heart's content. It's not like the race skills lack viability in literally all content.
---
... which is why people are so frustrated when they communicate like once every 3-4 months.  ArenaNet is *terrible* at selling their own game.  ArenaNet is dead-set on becoming the Bed 'n Breakfast of MMO's where veterans return every 3-4 months for 1-2 weeks and then go back to whatever it is that they're actually motivated to play.
---
The other problem with ranger is that if they nerf soulbeast then ranger has no viable dps in raids.
---
Just like engineer.
---
Anet simply lacks imagination when it comes to nerfs/buffs. Made worse by the fact that engineer is a complicated class that doesn't get it's damage from weapon skills like every other class in the game, but rather from it's kits. So they can't balance it in the same way as every other class. If they wanted to buff base engineer they could provide access to a condition damage build that isn't so fucking complicated. That's not a damage or power creep buff but an accessibility buff. It also wouldn't hurt to give Engineer a trait line more focused on condis that isn't fucking firearms because every single dps variant is going to take firearms due to the crit chance trait.
---
Blow up the Zephyrite airship again, obviously.
---
since when does gw2 have the best combat in the mmorpg genre. people say this but NEVER back it up with anything substantial.
---
sorry but this is firmly up there with "we have the friendliest community" as something every mmo player says about this community. please stop this meme, it isn't true. everyone knows it isn't true.
---
i think it is very telling it is only ever people who 'mainly' play gw2 that say this, and if i ask anyone else, gw2 doesn't even enter their mind when it comes to having the best combat. 
---
it boils down to cooldown-based skills, some of which have movement and flashy effects, but that does not mean gw2 has good combat. for that a total overhaul of combat would be necessary to get it anywhere close to approaching something decent.
---
Gems aren’t sold in New Zealand either anymore
---
Check /r/GuildRecruitment , good luck!
---
I analyzed this bug extensively a few months ago in order to report it, basically what I found out was that the automatic pet merging action is cancelled if you fall too far away from the pet after you dismount using engage. You immediately start to fall once the mount is gone, but your pet doesn't, so there's that bunch of frames where the pet tries to merge but "can't find you". It happens both if the engage skill ends while you're too far up in the air and if the ground is uneven (Heart of Maguuma is painful to deal with, especially parts like Dragon's Stand that go downhill).
---
All mounts have that problem aside from the Springer (engage skill goes on forever until you hit the ground), but it's indeed particularly bad with the Skyscale because it makes you jump down from it.
---
The person from support said they've escalated the ticket to the people who could do something about it, but that was shortly before the layoff situation so I wouldn't be surprised if tickets piled up in the past months.
---
Thanks!
---
I agree that GW2 has far superior open world content, with amazing maps and events. The combat is also fast paced with a high skill ceiling, and the game has the best QoL features of all the MMOs I have played.
---
I disagree however with your statement that FF14 is not a ‘real’ mmorpg, and that the combat is slow and (from what you seem to imply) easy. Combat is ff14 is a lot more tactical, and personally I find optimization in FF14 more challenging than simply spamming your buttons as fast as possible. Buffs are not permanent so a raid group needs to properly coordinate when they want to use their buffs, and healing is far more challenging, with 2 healers needing to coordinate with each other in order to optimize group healing and damage output. 
---
I have enjoyed both games for their different combat styles immensely, and both are incredibly fun in their own way.
---
I do think that your view on FF14’s combat is rather unfair, but I also agree that both games are different. GW2 is mostly an “open world” game with a focus on the world and its players with most of its content happening in large expansive maps (raids are even done in amazingly designed maps that look fantastic), whereas the bulk of FF14’s content is in small instances with a heavy emphasis on story (which far superior to that of GW2’s) and difficult boss fights such as Extreme Trials and Savage raids. 
---
My problem with GW2 (and why I am currently enjoying FF14 a lot more) is that despite its amazing combat, there really isn’t any content that can’t be cleared just by spamming the 1 button most of the time (even raids).
---
So for all your words you haven't named one game that combines tab and action targeting as seamlessly as this one.
---
Go ahead, try to. We'll be the judge of that.
---
Hiding behind a burner account too, huh. Karma too precious for ya?
---
I can hear this soundless gif...
---
You are not sensitive, its obviously meant to be passive aggressive. Do take other peoples comments seriously and trust yourself. Ok, so, I have struggled with social anxiety alot, and one thing that we do is we start doubting our own perception of reality. "Did he mean it passive aggressive?" "Was that comment directed towards me?" You start doubting your own gut feeling, and i feel like that is the worst thing about social anxiety. Trust yourself! Other people can be asses and its ok to call them out. 
---
The only tip i have for you, is to try and find a guild that you like. Do put yourself in situations where you have to talk, like in voice chat. It helps! Maybe not at first, but after a while. Took me months to feel comfy in voice chat, but now i even feel more comfy socially irl. But if people are rude, dont feel like you have to stay either! Some groups do develop quite a toxic feel. If you need an invite to a guild, send me a message. We do beginner fractals aswell, which is a good place to find people to play with!
---
Zojja - character has been afk for years now.
---
The problem is that Anet made those players to be 2 day players. They would not whine if they still played gw2 as their main MMORPG. Anet made them go away and they just come back to gw2 every 3-4 months as they are supposed to with the lack of content. Why would they waste their time on a "side game" that they play only for 2 day days every 4 months. I personally play gw2 every 4 months for like 5 hours and I m doing all the story and explore the map. Hunting idiotic collections is just a way they make us waste time because they cant release actual content. If you like hunting collections then good for you, but most people that play the game as it is supposed to (1-2 days every 4 months) cant be bothered grinding those.
---
Just another active friend who'll come online and do stuff with us
---
Clor of the Can Urr?
---
So you want every ranged option to be like deadeye. Thanks, no thanks.
---
You can preview all the skins in the wardrobe at any bank.
---
Idk. I don't watch too much. But I do recall Teapot saying that he is moving to WoW Classic when it's released.
---
Intent obviously matters to the offending person, because it marks the difference between normal people and assholes. It's still useless to everyone else, though. If you really felt intent didn't matter, you wouldn't bother to adjust your language. You would just claim that since your intent was good, you can keep saying whatever.
---
Likewise. I am seriously considering jumping to condi weaver right now. Has a similar rota (okay, some dashes are a bit awkward) and the numbers are so much higher it's not even funny. 
---
The only saving grace is the flexibility you have on cholo.
---
Maybe by knowing about places by actually playing the game before, so I knew what those hints are aiming at? It was then pretty easy to seek them. It literally just took few minutes of waypointing and looking around that map. You even had markers on minimap...come on...
---
Raids lately have been more sparse and minimalistic than ever since their introduction and people who play mostly or only for raids had an even rougher ride than they expected. I don't blame the hardcore raiders for being unhappy considering the schedule they had hoped for, but truth be told, this game will never satisfy any dedicated raider. They are better off having GW2 as a secondary game.
---
My bad, I meant to say end game, something that's not story or open world.
---
There is not that much to do in FFXIV when you finished xpac and the EX trials. They added new raids you can finish in less than 2 hours.
---
It’s fine if you are new to the game but it’s exactly the same situation. They just want to do something new and refreshing but it will be boring aswell.
---
Yo my man, I have been in an accident and cant use one of my arms as such i had to adapt for my passion of gaming. Look at this https://i.imgur.com/jN4WOCf.png this is my set up see if it works for you.  I use Alt instead of an F button, Alt + - for elite skill Alt + 1 Alt+3 for sheathe weapon etc.   Try it out it might help a lot.  
---
The mouse im using is Logitech g600 because of that extra button on the right side to use alt functions on (in fps games its usually jump there so i can do strafe/crouch jumps do get decent results in csgo and such)   If you dont like g600 i highy recommend looking for a mounse with and buttons on the right side so you can use all 5 fingers efficiently. Alternatively if your condition allows it - look into Foot switches they can add alt button functions too increasing your hotkey capabilities - Stay strong and with a bit of practice you can do just fine
---
Ok so your missing the point. If you mean to punch someone in the face or not does not matter to the person on the recieving end. They will still have been punched in the face. Im saying if you offend someone, the offender should take responibilty for what they have said, not just blame it on intent or saying the reciever should "not take other peoples opinions too seriously". The language you use has meaning, its communication, and if someone takes offense you take responsibilty for it. Otherwise, youre acting like an asshole, intended or not.
---
Your perspective appears as very sensitive. And so does OPs.
---
Are you on EU? Im similar too and want to get into fractals etc but put off by mediocre skills and possible expectations of groups on whatever class im using at the time. I play solo 100% but that can get boring.
---
Have I missed the window of opportunity to post threads complaining either about Anet not being able to produce content faster than I can consume it or are we at the point in the MMO cycle where I just keep saying the game is dead?
---
I think it's fine.. literally
---
imagine being such a worthless human being you base your respect of people on how they play video games and so totally not getting triggered over it
---
I hate it when going into water in WvW, as the soulbeast merge skills are removed then you have to wait to merge again.
---
Where did I say they are happy or I'm happy with the crappy state of the game currently.  
---
Nowhere, kisses 😘
---
yep gw2 combat is painfully average.
---
anyone who says it has the best is just broadcasting how little mmos they have really played tbh.
---
Dont worry, despite players here telling themselves gw2 is one of the bigger western mmos on par with ffxiv and others, it really isnt.
---
Let them figure it out. No hardcore players left but raids will still exclude them, wvw still doesnt function and fractals only get worse. Youd think they realise they're the source of the issue but they're still blaming the minority while demanding everything revolves around them, and stating they're the friendliest community.
---
The fact that these carebears aggressively attack anyone that doesnt share their point of view while deluding themselves is the best entertainment this game can still provide.
---
I agree. No game is dead as long as there is one monkey that enjoys it!
---
They also love this game. They're just disgusted by the state both the game and the community are in.
---
In her lab?
---
Your gut feeling is generated from past experience, which isn't always right especially from different society perspective. aka random stanger.
---
Imagine we have down scaling to prevent all previous content becoming trivial... oh wait we do.
---
And sorry but were not talking about difficulty of content but about how the community adapted to playing entirely brain afk, thus leaving little to no interaction between players
---
What she's actually wearing or the one in the inventory?
---
If inventory:
---
Chest is CoF
---
Leggings is draconic
---
If on character model:
---
The beginner light armor
---
Exactly. I once so happy that i got a free coin from one of the bag, i celebrate to pornhub and turns out its a trinket...
---
It's a game I used to play. It's a relationship that could've been awesome but went wrong at some point I guess. Our expectations and ideas about what this relationship supposed to be ended up being on an opposite ends of the spectrum so I ended it. But the fact I'm still here, browsing from time to time through that sub reddit proves I'm not over it, and still looking for a reason to come back and try again. But man Anet makes it more and more difficult with their silence and unknown future of the game.
---
Of course we have scaling.. But then we also have players who die, and instead of waypointing they wait there. I get frustrated with that, too. 
---
I do see people spamming 1 sometimes, but they generally get nowhere without the people actually putting in effort.
---
The only "nice" community is those that play strict cooperative, an environment designed to avoid negative interaction in open world. Those same players in any competitive environment cannot function and constantly behave like total monkeys which is a big part of why the "nice" ingame playerbase is insane toxic as soon as you leave openworld pve.
---
Rather than refute any point, you say that.
---
Imagine being this daft.
---
This happens for all forms of ranger! I get annoyed by this happening, a particular thing I find has 100% reproduction rate (for me at least) is to jump then glide before calling griffon mid-glide. Then dismount attack. This makes the pet disappear whether in soulbeast or having it out naturally.
---
I'd use the light cultural shoes that look like branches around your legs. That's typically my go-to for light armor looks. I love seeing the glow on the bottom of the feet.
---
Interesting, I didn’t know that, thanks.
---
Visions of Thunderhead Peaks-Corsair Leggings.  I was 30/30 before starting the collection, but the leggings are not showing on the collection.  I must have received them.  Any Help?
---
&gt;literally every mmo does this so um
---
I love how you're being so vague. Just goes to show how you're just blowing smoke up your ass. *Examples*
---
&gt;gw2 is not the only game with both, and they barely blend together well
---
*Sigh*. **Examples**
---
&gt;then surely the hardcore players must ask for an overhaul of combat? 
---
Why should they? Because you said so? Ok bud.
---
&gt;because gw2's combat isn't anything special.
---
Again, another baseless opinion with no supporting evidence. Whoulda thunk.
---
&gt;only gw2 players say this, as in only people who play only gw2 and nothing else.
---
BeInG vaGuE iS My OnlY DeFeNse. And *of course* you'd say that, as in **just you and no corroborative substance whatsoever**. 
---
&gt;i could ask the /r/MMORPG community. i could ask mmo-champion. i could ask mmorpg.com. i could ask massively.
---
&gt;they would all overwhelmingly not mention gw2 at all if i were to ask which mmo had the best combat.
---
Okay but... I. Asked. **You**. Are you that a
---
There's an in game gem store for some reason you know ...
---
Down voted cause I am bored. Nobody cares that you got your first period today.
---
I like this idea also, but my only fear is that basically it will promote even more toxic dungeon speed running culture. I really love dungeons, even in their kind of lame state, but I really can’t  stand the speed run toxicity. Not sure what they could do to curb that sort of thing.
---
I've had better experience with the forums honestly. Doesn't make it good though. Map chat is your friend. Some funny shit can happen.
---
Because the extra sliver of health you gain barely makes a difference. It's just not that kind of game.
---
It's extremely hard to fail in this game, the combat doesn't pose any actual challenge, but some fights take long and feel like a waste of time, especially when levelling a new character. 
---
This game doesn't seem to respect the players time in any way though, so at least it stays in character in this regard.
---
I know how to ignore shit, but how did the way my post was worded paint me as a crybaby? I didn’t scream or cry. I was making a small vent post that anyone could ignore if they didn’t feel like interacting with a “crybaby” like me. But there are people who intentionally go out of their way to mess with me for.. Fun I suppose. Other than that, I dunno why else they would.
---
From looking at your post history I can tell you aren't meant to be here.
---
I hope you keep enjoying the game though.
---
I tend to do daily T4 fractals whenever I'm on, before working on other things. I've been working on getting into raids (61 li) which has been a blast. Other than that, I've just finished Wayfarer's Henge on the path to Aurora and I've almost finished the Nightfury skin :) I'm not sure which legend you finished, but I enjoyed getting Ad Infinitum a while back.  
---
I'm lowkey saving some Living Story for when I get burned out on legend/skin hunting, but that's not my favourite content anyway
---
So the combat in other games is fun but you port away from it anyways? Oo
---
In this subreddit? I assumed a sub titled “GW2” would be about GW2. But I should’ve seen this all coming with how the sub is. 
---
I’ll try. I haven’t been able to play recently, so hopefully I won’t get too burnt out.
---
Haha, yeah. One time in Map Chat I’ve seen hundreds people praising Joko. I found a few of them, and noticed they were just dancing on top of the mountains. :3 Fun times..
---
It's a fair response, but GW2 is the kind of game you can drop in and out of. Keep playing if you're enjoying it, play something else if you're not.
---
I'm not looking at your history because that's pointless without reading the context behind each comment and I really don't feel like doing that.
---
Also, it really just sounds like you're associating with the wrong people. This game is generally nice as long as you don't stay in the wrong place for too long. I've had some bad experiences. Most of em were either reddit, forums, or toxic guilds full of pretender nice guys. Leave the shit behind and enjoy the game. You'll meet better people along the way as long as you don't get caught up in picking battles.
---
&gt; It's extremely hard to fail in this game, the combat doesn't pose any actual challenge
---
Maybe not for you, but there are players struggling with it. I remember a post of someone complaining about the difficulty of the First PoF mission.
---
Still, my point still stands, if you think they are not challenging then you wouldn't need the Waypoint anyway unless you run away and for that you can always just, you know, run away. 
---
&gt; This game doesn't seem to respect the players time in any way though, so at least it stays in character in this regard.
---
I totally disagree. The game respects your time more than other games. In 5000 hours I never felt a single time I had to do something that I didn't like nor that I had to fight something I didn't need to.
---
gw1's combat didn't age well, imo.
---
&gt; I recently came back but it looks like there is no reason to stay
---
This is so ridiculous that it's funny.  Because you can't avoid a fight at every turn by cheating and waypointing, you're going to quit.  I say good, please leave.
---
yes they work very hard on new gem store items, but not much else. thats how you keep a game on life support
---
I would live to see another threat then elder dragon this time though. But a cool idea.
---
And you could just not write it in the first place.
---
See that’s my point, you seem to think you have a right to do what you want to do, but any push back on those things and other people are being “toxic” to you.
---
For example you posted on a Reddit, in essence saying everyone is toxic... when you’re told that maybe you could be the problem... your response is “don’t judge me, you don’t know me. You didn’t even need to comment.”
---
The same can be said a million fold to you; you don’t know the majority of people on this Reddit or in this game, yet you’re judging them... you didn’t even need to comment.
---
It’s that kind of hypocrisy that probably gets peoples backs up about you. Also I don’t know why you referenced one fluff comment post you posted before. Yes you asked people what they got from the game, so?
---
Yeah, I’ve noticed that. This sub gives me horrible whiplash. One moment I’m being berated for playing the game casually, the next I’m having a nice chat about mass selling cabbages on the Trading Post.. It’s weird. 
---
Thanks, though. For not looking through my comment history. I dunno why people do it?? But I guess it’s so they can get more reasons to dislike me.
---
As long as you find about an hour a day for your daily fractals you won't miss anything even without a guild.
---
Yeah, for someone with cerebral palsy, who probably struggles to use their active defenses properly, for someone like that the extra 4000 or so health, which a mob can chip away in less than a second is definitely going to make the difference.
---
Instead of being an asshole actually think a little next time
---
After playing MMO's for +-15 years this doesn't bother me one bit.  
---
I ask advice, I do my own research, but in the end I play the way I want to play.  
---
I don't care about the meta or optimizing my gear/skills/rotations to perfection.  
---
I play my role and do my part, the way it feels good to me.
---
It's a game and I play it for the fun of it.  
---
If I wanted it to feel like a 2nd job, I'd get a job that pays me :D
---
OP posted a thread in anticipation of the usual gw2 circlejerk, got a few negative responses and and makes yet another post crying about the oh so toxic community. Grow up or just dont use the internet if you cant handle any form of criticism/negative responses.
---
People look for reasons and or excuses to shit on anything or make a point where and however they can.
---
Yeah, and if you have a crafting booster on you'll way overshoot (or hit the cap with a lot of materials left like I did)
---
why u dont have the balls and show ur trashtalk?:)
---
post everything and not only what u get as reply for shittalking the whole run I realy cant care less about you kid
---
Welcome to the internet.
---
You're confusing circlejerk with fact.
---
FFXIV is a circlejerk and a cult.
---
GW2 is debatably the friendliest and is often agreed upon because it's true, and disagreed upon by others who shill their games like and especially the FFXIV community.
---
&gt; You coulda ignored this vent post.  
---
&gt; and wanted interaction.   
---
make up your mind?
---
I mean I never seen one, while I had hundreds of mystic coins.
---
No, I’ve ghosted this sub for quite some time and have realized the building negativity.. Though I never realized it’d get this bad with people berating me for how I play. 
---
Though, I suppose you are right. I’m only on a few subreddits, the only one nearly as active as this one is the Monster Hunter one, and I haven’t even commented on that one. It’s jarring to have so much negativity flung my way.
---
Here? Yes my respect of other gw2 players while they're playing the game is based on their actions within the game.
---
Why wouldn't it be?
---
Easy. If you didn’t like my post, you could’ve ignored it. 
---
I wanted interaction, not be berated.
---
&gt;It’s jarring to have so much negativity flung my way.
---
but that's actually not the case, just a minority of the responses you get are negative at all. Why are you trying so hard to generalize something that isn't happening?
---
Bugman, are you still sane?
---
&gt;threaten to quit
---
Pathetic. How is that a threat to anyone beyond the biggest zealots. 
---
&gt;expect me, as someone who never tells people not to play, to console you like a toddler
---
How would you even assume something like that?  This is some epic level projecting. I expect the game to not annoy me with dumb design decision. I don't expect anything from you and you better not expect anything from me, you're nothing to me and won't get anything anyway. 
---
&gt;You are what makes the community look bad so I say good riddance.
---
So suggesting a design change that would stop people from wasting time is something that makes this community look bad. Good to know who you bugmen are.
---
When you salvage the unidentified gear directly you will only get the material from that rarity. But when you identify it you have a chance on getting better rarity out of it.
---
I had more than a few times when I opened a stack of green unidentified gear and got rares out of it.
---
I also found some links for the data for those salvages 
---
* [rares](https://www.reddit.com/comments/b6b10n)
---
* [blues](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/b6ksv5/breaking_down_blue_unidentified_gear_with/)
---
* [greens](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/b5xd7d/loot_tables_for_different_breakdown_methods_of/)
---
Tell me about it.
---
I play since beta, enjoy game like nothing before, have lots to do and amount of content still seems daunting to me. Yet, every time I praise it, I got sent into oblivion by no lifers zipping through every new episode on one day, complaining that there is nothing to do. Those are crying the loudest so anet made insane time gates to piss them off.
---
We used to have nice legendary weapons journeys, but TP barons and whales want to just buy everything day one (so they removed achievements) and then complain that there is very few leges.
---
If someone is happy with first lege done normal way, he gets nuked by players from of  braindead farms telling that they can do 1000g per day so its got a big deal.
---
And somehow, majority of reddit users are like that. Normal players mostly don't come here or official forum and they live a happy life, enjoying game and blocking toxic offshots.
---
This isn’t a support group, for your pent up frustrations though. 
---
Also I have to be honest, after reading the post you referenced... I actually have an even dimmer view of your post and your opinion.
---
The vast majority of people were positive and nice to you; which was by far the majority response you got.
---
A couple of people said your determined positivity in the face of people being frustrated by the many ways Anet has wasted the potential of GW2 made you seem like an Anet employee. You went mental about it at them and they quickly apologised.
---
You then returned to your previous behaviour of “oh I’m super happy you love this about the game.” And “oh I’m so glad you liked that!”
---
Like you can be optimistic if you like, but you can’t ask people for their opinions and then vent when people don’t always give you the viewpoints you want. Most people are frustrated by the amazing potential this game has, that has just never come to be. Those people aren’t being rude to you or negative about the game.
---
I’m a guild wars fanboi... I was a sysop on the official wiki and I have a character named after myself in the original game. If you’ve ever looked at armour pages on the wiki for gw1; that’s probably my work. Anet had me as a fan in the strongest terms and I’m proud to say I’m still a GW1 fanboi. so if someone like me, who actually is a proper fanboi, is disappointed by how much potential they have squandered with this game... then their really is an issue.
---
GW2 is an amazing concept, with some great content. Alas though it’s also shallow and it lacks a lot of the depth that people were hoping for. I still love the game, but it’s not what it could be and I know a lot of people are frustrated about that. That doesn’t make those people negative... it makes them passionate about a game they love and protective of its future. Those are the kind of fans a company needs, as those are the fans that want your game to succeed.
---
It's based on both your character level and distance traveled. If you need to save gold, make use of the gates in the capital cities or Lion's Arch which is the major hub between them all.  
---
It helps if you're going long distances like from Divinity's Reach/Kryta to Black Citadel/Ascalon. It's a few silver here and there, but ducking the cost by using those can add up.  
---
Also, waypoints within a capital city are free, so it's a quick way to get around town once you've gotten them.   
---
But, at the same time, you don't really need to worry too much about the costs. Selling a few gear pieces on the trading post can more than make up for it.
---
Marry me
---
You got the meme backwards. It’s “my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.”
---
a few where shitting on him while a lot of people where also nice and did show why they have a certain opinion.
---
If only one of the collection requirements could be 'don't be a dick' and could be revoked at any point.
---
Fair point.
---
It’s not generalizing when a lot of that is true. Sure, I’ve seen quite a few nice people, and met genuinely amazing people through the game and subreddit, but the overwhelming negative responses I get that not only target the game, but me and how I play are not cool at all. 
---
In general, I don’t understand why people can’t just let each other play the game the way they like. If you’re frustrated with the game, then aim that towards ANet, not other players of the community. It just creates an even larger rift.
---
yeah, the vast majority of people had positive reactions though.
---
He wanted interaction, just not interaction that goes against his opinion, duh!
---
/s
---
Much like 'legendary'.
---
It's so legendary that fifteen other people in this instance also have the same backpiece and greatsword as you.
---
Okay, I guess you can have your way of seeing things, not gonna keep going endlessly on the subject.
---
&gt; We used to have nice legendary weapons journeys, but TP barons and whales want to just buy everything day one (so they removed achievements)
---
That's not why they was removed, They was removed because Anet didn't think it was worth the dev time investment.
---
Yeah.. I don’t understand why people just can’t let people be happy with the game. It has problems, but if it’s someone’s favorite, then how is that hurting anyone? It’s just needless toxicity and gate keeping.
---
If a bag is giving you unidentified gear and nothing else, it's not the type of bag you should be saving for your bag opener.
---
u still dont get it dude nobody cared about ur dps if u haved 10k or 10 million dps i cant care less treat people like shit how u did since the first second u joined and they will do the same with you. If u just shut up and play nobody would flame you. But u prefer 2 shittalk 24/7 so u get what u deserve and im glad to see how hard it triggered you :)
---
You need to be in combat for dodge on clone to work. Don't forget that staff 3 conjures phantasms that only turn into clones after their attack - that's often much later than when you need it. Other mentioned also that it becomes with the resummon trait in the chrono line.
---
Okay so I should identify everything before salvaging with CFSOM. Thanks, the first guy to respond didn't even answer my actual question and just explained to me stuff that my post clearly covered me understanding
---
Regarding the tonal whiplash you see in my comments, I have only a bit of time in my day to browse Reddit so I like to get my comments out as soon as I can, and interact with as many people as I can. So that’s why I go from getting annoyed and sour to being happy and glad for people.
---
i am not even attacking you? its simply confusing.  
---
like literally everyone could make a vent post like this about any topic if hes active on reddit and posts controversial stuff where people start to argue about.
---
How is it intrusive if you basically presented people with the option to look through your post history for context
---
&gt; If you don’t wanna look through my post history then I’ll sum it up.
---
Btw, you don't want to be berated but
---
&gt;if they got anything better to do with their lives than browse through my post history.
---
this is hilariously ironic.
---
On the contrary, GW2 has the best 300 ping combat. It feels smooth (some stuff is handled client-side like gliding I imagine?), unlike TERA which is almost unplayable.
---
Your post speaks for itself.
---
Cat race? As opposed to the cat accessories for sale, because the game can't easily support an extra race?
---
Consider this "Any" point refuted.
---
Okay so I'm confused about the unidentified gear. Do I salvage it as is or identify it?
---
You should realize that you should not be talking about balance the instant you start comparing classes to try validate an overpowered skill/trait/mechanic...but that's expecting too much from the average whiny redditor.
---
Try working on your class too. Unless you are perfect then you deserve perfect.
---
Just a thought.
---
Yes everything that gives you gear thats adjusted to your characters level. That includes:  noxious seed,  embroidered coin purse, and bags of gear.
---
i mean as long as you do not fuck up the gameplay of others with it, thats perfecly fine.  
---
i guess you are not going with this intention into groupplay where people optimize their builds into teambuilds so they add onto eachother.  
---
expecting anything good with this intention when going into groupplay without changing anything would be foolish tho.
---
I think Scourge, Mirage and Weaver are the best designed ESpecs so far
---
So should I salvage the unidentified gear?
---
THIS.
---
I love the norn lore. I hate that Becoming the Bear is so useless in play. 
---
Having it be I skill 0 sucks ass as well
---
May your day be as pleasant as your arguments are informative.
---
How convenient that you missed this comment:
---
&gt; Ok, so they should at least allow it in downed state or add an option to commit suicide. On a low level character it's often faster to die than fight a group of elite enemies anyway.
---
Anyway, the game is now gone from my hdd, I'll issue a chargeback for the gems I bought and be done with it forever.
---
From a WvW perspective, it looks like an RvR and PvP guild waiting room until one of those kickstarted PvP MMOs gets somewhere.
---
Almost every WvW guild discord I've seen has gone through the phases: "Planning for Alliances update" (Pre 2019), to "giving up on Alliances saving the game mode and scouting out Crowfall/Camelot/ESO/BDO/other games (and finding out they're not as good, or deciding to Quit/hibernate until release)", to "hey we're gonna play Classic WoW/FFXIV: Shadowbringers/ESO Elsweyr". 
---
On the raiding/PvE front... everyone went to play FFXIV. As others have said that's pretty normal for PvE players to play another MMO while their main one is in a content lull but unless there's interesting content (like a new expac) there would be no reason to return. W7 was a huge failure from a "revitalising raiding guilds" standpoint.
---
I don't get why this post is being downvoted? are we not allowed to ask for people's opinions on this sub?
---
Thanks to the people who've kindly igven their advice anyway &lt;3
---
For example none of lw maps were even close to HoT metas. Neither was PoF but whatever. But even new map from ls is not same quality as expansion maps. Pof maps are rich or lore, events, collections etc. Ls maps offer the same but on much smaller scale.
---
I also left NA after being there since launch. Im European, and the WvW on NA was mostly or primarily dead, as well as almost all the other maps and activities. You will have people doing stuff here and there in PvE but its not a lot and nothing near EU. On NA things pickup after 6-8pm EU side (give or take 2hrs with the timezones, same thing). But even then the most activity starts at way past 11pm. 
---
Its all fine if you only play on weekend evenings or a couple hours every evening on weekdays but during the daytime there wont be much going on. Just a warning. I personally didnt mind it and the reason I stayed NA for so long was because I could do other things during daytime since nothing was up. 
---
When finding a server you should also consider the guilds and commanders they have and when they run. Ask around on reddit or fellow discords before transferring.
---
Before they removed the Magic Find it was worth opening it on a character with high Magic Find. Now I am not 100% sure. But I remember many posts on this subreddit were people posted their results.
---
The impact of the firings not even kicked in (besides some minor delays of the last episodes). All that was released untill now was long in production before the firing. The real impact will show between episode one and two of season five and onwards. MMO development is not measured in weeks or few months. Most of these things are going through a months - if not close to a year - cycle from concept to actuall release.
---
Also FF got an expansion. PPl will always gravitate to a game with a huge recent content drop. Wait till WOW classic is released next month. Your post will be over the reddit times hundred with wow instead of FF in the title. And on some point they will be bored and look for alternatives.
---
GW2 has not lost steam at all. There are more things to do now than since the release of pof. The "problem" for you - or your friends - is that you don't want to participate. What is totally fine but nothing to scream doom and gloom. We were in the exact same place as HOT was released. Noone knows what comes, it took more than nine months till the release and ppl screamed content drought. The game still exists ... even with the slow content directly after HOT were nine months, again, was not so much new added to the game besides balance, three raids and a major overhaul of the hot-zones (what is the reason why most players enjoy them so much now).
---
I recently downloaded the FF14 trial and I think everyone should give it a try. It's a very different game with a strong emphasis on story. 
---
You start to appreciate the things that GW2 gets right, like the fast action combat and many quality of life features.
---
When it comes to story and cutscenes Anet are high school-level amateurs compared to Square Enix.
---
Who are you?
---
Nobody is asking you to be sorry. But nobody appreciates you trash talking everyone born after 1988 based on what you read from a reddit sub for an MMO. If your only exposure to people born after 1988 is from a reddit sub then you really should go out and explore the world more. 
---
Have you been living under a rock since 1988? 
---
And yes, you are wrong. All you are is perpetuating the stereotype of an old man complaining about “Kids these days”. Those “kids” could just as well blame your generation for all the shit they have to deal with today such as environmental degradation. Nobody has thus far, making them far more mature than you. 
---
Act your age and be a role model. You’re embarrassing yourself.
---
If you have been around here for some time, you should know the community WAS POSITIVE, especially leading up to PoF launch. It was hype, game was alive again, and it looked like Anet was delivering content and new stuff and changes and listening to the community and...
---
Then it kinda fizzled out after PoF, was revealed that the majority of the team was working on other projects, MANY stupid dramas, stale meta post-PoF...
---
Yeah. The game got bad, so people got mad.
---
There is a massive difference between a race and a gemstorw item. Also, it is pretty much agreed Tengu are the most likely race to be added, as they were nearly added at launch.
---
It's funny what a few toxic streamers and their fanbase can do when they collide with the rest of the players, huh.
---
Though it isn't just that - Guild Wars 2 is mainstream and F2P. There's nothing like something being offered for free to attract toxic entitlement, and being mainstream means some people join just because something is known and their friends play it, even though they are going to spend all the time complaining about it afterwards. 
---
Plus, being mainstream also means that it has to continually compete with an increasingly saturated market of alternatives in their eyes (which for some reason they won't move on to) as opposed to the more dedicated communities not always searching for the greatest and the latest. People normally move on in this case, but the problem is with people who don't, who just remain to spew toxicity.
---
Though Reddit is particularly bad because it values the emotional "upvote/downvote" you have over something over the actual merits of the argument being presented. In a typical forum format, you can at least point out the flaws in arguments and other people have no option but to reply to you to defend them (and reveal their own intrinsic flaws in their argumentation). Not so in Reddit. Before, people at least paid some minimal heed to Reddiquette, but the children running around nowadays just exploit it for what it is, a flawed system that works only in controlled circumstances.
---
He can't, it isn't the "K" series.
---
You can do most of the game solo or with pugs. Only higher tier content will give you problems:  
---
Fractals - you can easily pug t4. CMs will be harder, but still possible.(EU)  
---
Raids - on **EU** the pug scene is healthy, but you'll struggle to get the LI needed to enter pug squads if you can't commit to a training guild 🤷. From what I've heard on **NA** raids are done mostly in statics and not with pugs.  
---
This is a very small part of the content the game has to offer, so i think you should be good. I doubt you mean the 5% hardcore content of the game when you want to play casually anyway 😛
---
I agree completely. The upvote and downvote system is just downright abused, it’s kinda sad. 
---
And I suppose the lack of an entry fee would make GW2 more open to toxicity, but sometimes it’s even veterans that are gate keeping and being too elitist. It’s a shame, cause I don’t doubt this game has a wonderful community... Just, outside of Reddit.
---
There is a MASSIVE difference between a race in FFXIV and a race in GW2.
---
You're daft, it's ok.
---
\&gt; as they were nearly added at launch.  
---
lol
---
All dismounts cause the soulbeast to dismerge and it happens pretty frequently as well. It's super annoying and you get a cd before you can remerge again. Anet fix this.
---
Braham found some magic scroll that was supposed to make Jormag vulnerable to his arrows. He enchanted his bow with it, ran off and broke the tooth, then gathered a posse of norn to go kill Jormag off-screen. He might have done it, if we hadn't put Jormag to sleep with Taimi's machine. So that's why he was pissed at us for a while, because we kinda stole his glory (and he wanted to prove that his norn get-it-done attitude could tackle these dragons before they hurt anyone else, little did he know that killing them would further disrupt the balance of the world).
---
Kitty's been continuing her Kittymarks dps testing finally and the drop isn't actually that huge (at least for kitless) if you're using ECSU instead of PBM though the rotation is now a lot more difficult since you need to make sure you don't overheat. When Kitty last tested the kitless holosmith, it was about 28,4k'ish (with PBM) and now it's 27,1k (with ECSU) so not that super-huge of a drop.
---
And the mandatory link to Kitty's kitless benchmark vid: https://youtu.be/x1xPz3RuM1E
---
Yeah it's perfectly fine to play solo. I am assuming you have the base game without any expansions. If that's the case, this is what you can do solo:
---
=
---
- Story campaign (base game and Living Story Season 2)
---
- World bosses 
---
- Silverwastes meta event 
---
- Core Tyria map exploration and completion 
---
- WvW roaming and blobbing
---
Here's what you can do if you're willing to get some randoms or friends to join you:
---
- 8 dungeons with 25 explorable paths and 8 story paths (1 being soloable as it is part of the core story campaign).
---
- Fractals from level 1 - 100.
---
- Guild missions.
---
- PvP 
---
= 
---
If you have the expansions there's more endgame stuff to do and all that, but depends on what you have. Core game is solid though, us veterans pretty much had only that during the first 3 years or so of its life.
---
....why? Do you only PvP / WvW?
---
Tengu WERE nearly added a launch, do you have a fucking clue about this game at all. Or are you just trolling the sub?
---
Oof. Yeah, Warrior sure is overpowered, huh. Ri-i-ight. And so is Chrono by having 0 utility aside from pull, below-average DPS and no flexibility aside from "can remove boons with shatters or can't".   
---
Also, not sure I appreciate your tone - if you wish to voice your opinion, FYI calling someone "average whiny redditor" usually doesn't help you whatsoever or makes you any more valid.   
---
But do explain me - what would you do that won't be a feature stripping and won't make classes less fun to play, then? Not to mention that you do miss a crucial point - you get those features by traiting. These are choices that shape your build's functions, and by choosing to have Cleansing Ire/ Restorative Illusions, you give up on potential damage/burst potential/whatnot. How is build diversity a power creep, exactly? You sound as if you parrot some points made, but without actual understanding of a concept, like this one time everyone remembered "deus ex machina" when it wasn't even applicable to writing here as much.
---
I wasn't debating that :)
---
i mean thats exactly what happens in ff14, despite people pretending otherwise. people come back every 2-3-4 months, play the story, grind a bit of gear and df whatever is available and leave again until the next patch.
---
Yeah that's fair, I don't think anything said on reddit or even maybe the forums should apply to new players or more casual players, because GW2 is still delivering on that front and the sheer breadth of content from the years since release makes it very enjoyable. It's an amazing game in many aspects. Tbh it's just for salty vets (like me at this point) who want to see the game improve or deliver new content or rekindle the hype from the old days. 
---
Another thing to keep in mind is that this juncture in between Season 4 and 5 is basically the make-or-break point for many veteran players (like the people who populate my guilds list and friends list, who I associate with and therefore am influenced by). 
---
HoT into PoF was one season of Living Story essentially filler content following on into a fully-fledged expansion, and now we are hanging on the edge with no idea what is going to happen post-layoffs and after Season 5. The metagame at a more veteran level is getting very stale, because of the way Anet has designed the elite specs any "balance patches" barely shift the meta and end up just making more people mad. The prospects of an expansion would change things up from the meta perspective (good for endgame PvE and PvP players), and excite new or casual players (new zones, lore, exploration, change of scenery).
---
The *worst* thing that could happen is that they announce that nothing is planned after Season 5. What this would mean would be: repeating the same daily content for the next few years with no excitement at the end of the tunnel. WvW and PvP players have to endure the meta that they don't enjoy for another 2-3+ years (which would make people leave very quickly, knowing the game isn't going to get any more fun). PvE'rs would suffer the same dread: a chronomancer main would have been playing Chrono tank exclusively for something like 7 years if a new expac would come out after Season 5.

Because there's no progression other than *horizontal progression*, no expansion and dull balance patches means that without a silver lining at the end there would be no exciting content to keep veteran players around anymore. I guess you could say they would have effectively "finished" the game and would need to move on if this were the case, but then comes the argument of missed potential.
---
**Tl;dr** Vets salty as always, but especially salty because it comes at a turning point for the game (in between S4 and S5; with nothing known past S5). Either Anet announces an expansion or some exciting MAJOR changes coming to the game within the next few years, or people will get very mad their favourite game is not going to see a major transformation/revitalisation like what HoT was to Vanilla. 
---
Personal note (about off-peak timezones): For me, if no expansion comes, and no major changes come to PvP/WvW or raids, then the game as an MMO is going to become difficult to play. PoF revitalised my timezone a bit but the population drop-off has been getting more and more severe. In WvW, no guilds, no commanders, barely any fights, and no roaming scene. For raids, there's basically no LFGs, and aside from one or two discord servers which organise a run once a week the rest are playing other games or dead. There is some critical mass of players required to effectively play a multiplayer game and without it it's going to be tough to continue, which is why people are on edge. Some players are reaching that point, whilst others (like EU prime players) might not reach that point for a few years yet. In any case, my perspective is just complaining about the state of the game as regards my timezone; but it's not complaining because I dislike the game, but because I want to keep being able to play it and not have to swap to another game with enough players to engage in multiplayer content.

Nevermind, you're 100% trolling mate. Seriously comparing humans with cat ears to GW2' races and the gemstore.

&gt;Seriously comparing humans with cat ears to GW2' races and the gemstore

What?
---
  
---
Are you ok? Where's the logic?
---
WP - thanks to his master ambitions - plays atm more than during the months before its attempt to max out the game. He even streams gw2 two to four hours on a daily basis for two months straight now. Put him on your fl and look how much he is online. Doesn't look like burn out for me. He has mentioned interest in wow classic but I think every interested mmo gamer has at least thought about this topic once. The question is if ppl will leave gw2 for that? Leaving means without thinking back. Most peeps will most likely try it out and return as soon as they get bored because both games are so vastly diffrent in its demanding factor. Also in regards to WP: He has always played other games. Even in its gw1 days. But due to his efforts with his lets play - what seems not to be a buisness but a passion desicion - he put anything else on hold. There were multiple lets plays from him in the past on products that are not gw2. 
---
I wouldn't believe a reddit post just because they pick out one or two sentences out of dozens of hours of streaming content.
---
And in regards to the other content creators: If leaving gw2 is a buisness decision - if it is there fulltime job to create content or at least success is a factor within there thinking - than I would say it is a smart move. Not because the game is dieing or something like that. Because the game is not suited for a healthy buisness. I mean you have brought up WP. He mentioned multiple times that it is hard to come buy with just his let's play videos during the last year. And they were exceptional high quality. But it is content every gamer can consume by itself. If you want to make money out of content creation for mmos, the mmo needs something that is not easy accessible for the majority of the playerbase or you have to have a huge personality to bring ppl to watch your content regarding the nature of your groundwork game. Besides that you can only make news videos to receive watchtime.
---
Did you get the selection box and throw it into storage somewhere?  Use GW2Efficiency to search for "Corsair" and see if one of your characters is holding the box.  It doesn't count until you open it.
---
Yeah I’ve had a lot of...experiences lol. I’ve been through quite a bit in my 24 yrs, and I think the isolation is what is getting me now. I’m so used to only entertaining myself now that I almost forgot how to make friends online. Like I said I used to be great, before all the shit hit the fan in my life and I decided having no friends is less hurtful than having shitty friends so I just stopped trying. I you want to invite me to your guild I won’t say no haha, thanks for the reply.
---
Sad to see you think like that. Well once all raiders and WvW'ers and pvp'ers leave the game maybe you will notice. 
---
When raiders leave the game, one of the funniest thing in this game, buildcraft, also dies, for pve at least. (Casual players ain't gonna put 2 fking fucks into buildcraft). Then you want to visit the website for builds and guess what, is closed. So the point of new elite specs and what not, at least on the pve side, also gets less exciting.

---
From my perspective, I'd say writing-wise the "oh by the way, remember there's a reason I'm limping everywhere? Yeah, I'm dying to it now, btw" is just an unnecessary element for a character. It didn't make me any more or less invested in actual story, did nothing to send any sort of message or impacted the plot in any way. It's simply "eh ok good luck with that, not like you won't upload yourself to some golem or whatever".
---
Yeah I think I also kinda shut my brain off and stop looking at chat sometimes. Force of habit that I need to break. I used to be able to read chat and do whatever, but my brain capacity seems like it dropped quite a bit lol. I try to be receptive at least, like I had a conversation in guild when I joined and they all said welcome but then every other time I’ve felt like I’m inserting myself and I don’t want to do that blah.
---
Don't forget, it also only works when moving forward. You can't strafe or backpedal. It is indeed worse than Swiftness, despite being much harder to acquire.
---
Only way i would enjoy a quaggan expansion is if we had to kill every last one of them.
---
You should realize that you should not be trying to have a discussion of any kind when you can't help yourself from taking things out of context and fail to comprehend simple English...but that's expecting too much from the average whiny redditor.
---
I’ve been trying to think of it that way more lately, it’s just hard to break coping mechanisms from younger years that previously helped me cope I think. I’ve also had a bought of insomnia lately and it’s hard to think at all.
---
We can try! I’ll DM you soon
---
Even a derpy bencher like Kitty got 27,1k on kitless ECSU sword+pistol holo so the actual ceiling should be somewhere around 28,5-29k at least for a good benchmarker.
---
So what is wrong with plurality of opinions? 
---
We live in freedom^tm times, that means everyone can have their own opinion, so something like "hur dur someone is not agreeing with me" is not offensive but should be a standard.
---
I was seeing a therapist but I’m having issues with insurance right now and haven’t been able to see one lately. I was going to someone for EMDR but they were hella expensive. I’ll have to figure that whole thing out. Thanks for your encouragement though, I agree I think therapy would be very helpful but unfortunately this is merca so yeah :(

Always keep clones up, Phase Retreat whenever anything is nearby, never let anything get near you ,time your dodges right. Chaos Armor if something is hitting you, it will cripple it so you can run. Chaos Storm chills so you can run as well. If you get a nasty condition, pop Jaunt. Also pop Jaunt to get away when Phase Retreat is on cooldown.
---
Have 2 staves and use Superior Sigil of Energy to get another dodge every 9 seconds.
---
There's not much healing. Don't get hit. That's the gameplay of mesmer, illusions and trickery to never take a hit :\^).
---
I’m US 😭 dangit that’s like the 3rd EU nice person! Lol. Your comment helped though, you’re right, the people who complain about that aren’t worth my time. I’ve been thinking of it in the opposite way, obviously I’m not worth their time,  but that’s a better way to look at it so I’m gonna try telling myself I don’t need em anyway if they’re gonna be like that. Thaaaaanks!!
---
Everyone plays on EU! Lol. I’m US sorry :( I would play with you if I could. I also feel that way, like sometimes people don’t even give me a chance, but admitably I could be totally imagining it, idk. There’s a bunch of EU guys here offering to try being friends though maybe you could DM them!

---
Literally 99% of the posts to you in your fluff post, were kind and polite. You’ve happened to get your panties in a bunch about a couple of comments thinking your positivity was forced. When you reacted to that, and I would say over reacted to it, both parties immediately apologised to you and you said that was okay.
---
You then ran here to bitch about it...
---
The fact you can’t see your behaviour is toxic, is beyond me. You’re the kinda person who triggers others and then feels victimised about it.
---
Stop this.
---
You didn't make a single logical or coherent point though that actually refuted anything I said. I honestly pity that you think you did, it's pretty sad. The cognitive dissonance envolved must be staggering. 
---
Anyway, I forgive you. It was a little thing called "personal preference" but that is obviously something a bit advanced for you. I shouldn't expect more from someone like you though as you obviously are a bit deficient in some areas, poor thing.
---
Enjoy marching with you chinos and tiki torch!
---
Best of luck :)
---
You’re fine! I understood everything perfectly. I’ll just google small gw2 guild and see what pops up. You nailed it right on the head, I have a lot of difficulty saying hi first. It’s so weird because I haven’t always been like that but I’ve been through some shit over the last decade that’s kinda squashed my self worth. It’s gotten a lot better as I’m not in a quasiabusive relationship anymore and my new bf encourages me all the time, but I still have a long way to go. I’m glad you found those friends! Yeah it’s weird I was thinking the opposite - more people in big guilds so therefore there’s a better chance of me finding someone likeminded, but after talking to everyone on here it seems it’s the opposite. Thanks for your novel! I appreciate it!
---
Not really, but because Chrono is heavily associated with Druid as a partner you often would have both in a group, which limits you to 3 dps (rolling dps based utility like Bannerslave in this to make it easier) and 2 slots support while with Renegade/Firebrand (aka the "Firebrigade") you are getting 4 slots DPS, one support (as either the Ren or the FB can be a healer, with the other being a utility DPS, examples being Quickbrand and some forms of Diviner Renegade).
---
In fractals where access to both dps and your heals and boons can be limited compared to content with more players per group, getting more damage without sacrificing your utility is highly desired.
---
Seems like it, maybe he can afford to sell it and buy a K version hopefully.
---
Well I did beat PoF, but yeah I usually just do sPvP - can't be bothered to train masteries
---
Cheers, hope you keep enjoying the game like we all did when we started playing!
---
&gt; Apparently they really had no way of finishing them  
---
thats their fault not ours. if someone sells a product and says: this and this and this is included and someone buys it, then there is a binding contract where you can't simply pull out.  
---
imagine buying a car with all inclusive and then a few months when you should get it the producers says: oh sorry, there is no radio, no A/C and no autopilot...couldn't fit those features into the car in time.  
---
its funny how gaming is the only fucking business where people do excuse such behavior because of "oooh the devs, they ha no time yada yada yada".
---
I feel ya man, it's indeed harder to do it without feeling forced. But there are at least 2 things you should keep in mind:
---
1. being self conscious it's good, but don't let it completely stop you, we're playing the same game so at least that we have in common and it's a pretty safe introductory topic to start conversation.
---
2. if you're in EU add me (Rev.5836), I'll be glad to help on whatever or just chat :)
---
It might be dead for CMs but there's a lot of skips that Chronos can do that other classes can't for T4s and recs. It's just a trade off.
---
Nope
---
Yeah Mirage is hard, you only have like 27 dodges and invulns
---
I will definitely look into that sub! Thank you so much! People have said I should look for a small casual guild at first so I think that’s what I may do. I am already in a couple of bigger guilds so I’ll see what works better.
---
I am a long-term gw player, playing since gw1 nightfall with some breaks inbetween. Recently I had a break from gw, playing poe for about a month. I am more or less done with poe now and wanted to check up what is new with gw. Now, while i can play any class/roll and have everything geared, I spent by far most time with chrono. Now imagine me loging back on, looking for a fractal daily group (need few more dailies for fractal god), only to realize, I cant shatter nor distort... Now, this just made me go back to poe, evne though i am bored of it allready. So until wow classic there is a month, gw does not look promising (nothing exciting announced AND they are destroying what was initially solid and enjoyable). I think similar experiences might be the reason for players migrating to alternatives.
---
Fuck me you're salty, get a job lmao
---
We need a character named Lyanna Nornont.
---
Thanks! Someone commented that GW2 has enough players who are anxious and sensitive and to stay away...people can be really mean and I really do not understand it. 🙄 why would one want less players for their online community driven game? What if I’m actually cool when they actually get through to me? They don’t know but they wanna judge...I seriously hate that attitude.
---
The guides may still be worth reading but the builds haven't been updated since March. No point try to comb through the builds to see which are still relevant and which aren't, I'd just use http://metabattle.com/wiki/WvW at this point.
---
This entire mindset genuinely confuses me. As another commenter mentioned subs like audible, netflix, hulu, etc etc etc. are becoming ever more popular. So people are clearly okay with subscriptions for entertainment. But that's not the point I wanted to directly bring up.
---
I'm perplexed that to you a 5/mo sub would be a deal breaker, yet a game only providing the majority of it's rewards through a cash shop is not. A game charging almost as much as a months sub to another mmo to change your hair style, that is not. GW2 by -not- having a sub has become infinitly more expensive than any sub based mmo. Yes, you "can play without ever paying more than the entry price" but that's not how it's going to work really, is it? The devs NEED you to spend money. That's the problem. In a sub based mmo you and the devs have come to an agreement. They know you'll pay x per month, and you know you'll get what the devs have sustained as expectations.
---
But in a game like GW2 that doesn't work. They have an almost guarentee you'll spend on a new expansion, sure. but outside that they have nothing whatsoever as a sure thing. So, now they need to convince you, constantly. Which ends up hurting the game. The fact you can't earn any mount skins in game (my information may be out of date, not played in a few months) the fact almost every single new item is in the gem store. minipets? gemstore. New armor skins and cosmetics (which is the end game, since there is no stat progression past a point) gemstore. Gliders, even fathering tools that don't break, gemstore. They have to prey on you to make you spend. They have to strip what would be part of the games content to make it something you want to buy.
---
So, yeah, I just don't understand this, at all. I don't understand how 5/mo would be a deal breaker, yet everything Anet does in fact do is somehow okay, as what they currently do is infinitely more predatory than a simple sub fee would be.
---
lol alright
---
Scrapper was never well-balanced for PvP and there were constant complaints about bunker Scrappers, that's probably part of the reason it got nerfed (ahem, sorry 'reworked') so heavily this patch. It's just unfortunate that they did the typical Anet thing of rebalancing for PvP by crippling it in all game modes.

not a big deal for me but personal markers that previously used the generic diamond icon are now showing up with the icon for lumber/wood nodes

&gt;The true Mirage ~~gameplay~~ endgame.
---
I was talking about the traditional PBM build (and with shield). Maybe ECSU+pistol gets higher, but at the cost of stupid heat micromanagement and much less CC. And even then, 29k is a joke. As  Nico\_is\_not\_a\_god already joked, the new newbie-friendly holo build is going daredevil or, as I may add, DH. Simple rotations, higher damage even at sloppy execution and much more utility/CC than holo after the nerf.
---
Would it be possible to have a floating window that keeps track of your buy orders or things you have listed for sale that would check and alert you if you've been outbid or undercut? :D
---
Hey i just started a week ago in gw2, as necro Power, where i should farm for get at least 10g hour? Cauz ive seen that for play dragonfall i should buy the chapter? Omg
---
Why? Thats a dumb question. Thats like wanting to turn off a Necros shadowy effect when they turn on shroud. Or an Eles elemental bracelets or, wait, the other classes arent as cool.
---
Hey where are u from? Pm me ur discord
---
Thanks.
---
Yes, chances are you get grouped with people, that just want to farm / rush the dungeon. Happens less, when you choose the story mode, because you don't get any currency from this.
---
Rest of the thing is also you trying to engage with people. If you are silent, then don't expect others to start a conversation.
---
I just like to shake up the group with some stupid jokes and puns and from time to time some people give in and enjoy it / react to the shit talk in the chat. :)
---
Those are the people you should totally ignore. They enjoy how people feel bad and want to see the world burn. Don't give them that pleasure. You desrve to feel good, enjoy the game, meet amazing people.
---
I sexually identify as a turtle banner. Ever since I was a little boy I dreamed of giving ten stacks of stability to my entire team. People tell me that turtle banner is underpowered but I don't care. Other teams don't know how to target and focus turtle banners so I can't be countered. From now on I want you guys to call me turtle banner and respect that I am the best out of all the banners. Shocked by the shell!
---
Why did you delete your other comments :(
---
I was checking and saw your edits.
---
My question was because I, like others, have more Discord Channels joined, and I like others have the app in personal mobile phone and it is a shame when I/We felt that we need to tottally mute or even leave a channel because ppl use and abuse the @everyone shout.
---
Good luck with this Discord if you can get commanders for multiple activities/farms and ping ppl that are interested in that for that moment then it will succeed.
---
You’re so very sweet! Well keep doing what you’re doing because you never know what someone is going through and your friendship could be the one thing keeping a person going. I feel like my mom and bf are the only reason I’m even alive rn as I think about how I just want my chronic pain to stop and just end it literally every day, but I could never leave them like that, esp my mom. She’d fall apart and never come back together, I know it, and I have to keep going for them. I want more people in my life who i feel like care if I am on that day because I brighten their mood. I used to greet my best friend from WoW by yelling her name in chat over and over again lol, and she’d yell my name back. Was that annoying? Probably. Did I give a shit? Nope. Was that because I was a kid? Probably. Was I happy as fuck? Yes...now that I’m an adult I feel way more pressure to act a certain way as I don’t have the excuse of being a kid if I come off as annoying. I’ve isolated myself for so many years I don’t even remember what is considered annoying at this stage in my life. I think I just feel lost in general a lot lol.
---
They are a gold and a half now. The Gen 2 legendaries take almost two stacks of them to make so their prices skyrocketed. Also they limited the amount you get to 20 every month.
---
Ye weirdly enough people don't like being lied to and buying a product that doesn't contain what's advertised.
---
I would never be able to remember what button I mapped to what skill.
---
You're always more than welcome to join my guild pal!  
---
Drop me a message, either here or in game ("Elemental Alchemist") if you're interested :)
---
Maybe thats the point, still have to download 200k files
---
I wouldn't stress as much as you do, because you'd probably soon have no fun anymore if you're starting to grind gold after just a week. What do you need the gold for anyway? 
---
I mean it's your decision but I'd recommend simply doing story and doing stuff that accompanies it naturally. Or just doing dungeons/whatever you want. But starting to repeat content while you still have so much fresh stuff to do just for the sake of gold seems "unfun".
---
Also isn't Dragonfall still active as current Living world, so that everyone unlocks it that logs in?
---
Dragonfall I'd imagine, do the meta, collect mistborn notes, and consume them for magic
---
Mirage (and mesmer, in general) is about high situational awareness.  Your goal is to be not hit:
---
* Mirage's evasion on dodge is huge, learn to time your dodges.  Find ways to get vigor (dodge regeneration).
---
* Use your high mobility to control what is near you, such as leap (staff 2), teleport (blink, jaunt), veil, etc to be able to get away from trouble.
---
* Your clones are your damage, but they are also your shield.  Do not mindlessly destroy them.  Scepter auto will generate new clones, as well as many skills (like decoy, mirror images, etc).  Mesmer can easily go from damage to survivability by choosing not to destroy clones.
---
* Staff's power is that the auto attack bounces between the target and friendlies.  You want your clones to be near enough so that it repeatedly bounces, doing damage to the target and buffing your clones.  Chaos Storm (staff 5) damages your target, but also buffs friendlies in it.  Use it to make your clones more survivable.
---
* Inspiration traits are great for increasing your survivability, notably [Sympathetic Visage](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sympathetic_Visage).
---
* Dueling is nearly a must have.  It makes your illusions and clones more effective, but [Deceptive Evasion](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Deceptive_Evasion) generating a clone on dodge means another source of clone generation (plus it confuses the enemy).
---
Mesmer is not an easy class to play.  The ability to create a lot of confusing clones is offset by the class being very squishy.  Finally, mesmer's downfall is conditions.  Any fight where conditions is spammed you are just going to have a bad time, hero point or otherwise.  Mesmers can do a lot, but not everything.
---
I love being a mesmer.
---
Dragonfall.
---
Hello there,
---
There is actually a possibility if you have unlocked a elite specialization:
---
1. Equip Elite traitline
---
2. Equip Glint/Kalla stance
---
3. Switch Elite traitline
---
4. Repeat for second slot
---
This will remove your stances and the visual effect!
---
Cheers!
---
They are leaving because of the complete radio silence from Anet. Sure we got a very loose road map a few months back, but nothing since.
---
Well if you could only use the mouse, you'd figure it out pretty fast.
---
ugh weeb game
---
&gt; What is GW2 to you?
---
A glorified beta test with immense amounts of wasted potential. A big project ruined by the laws of casual communities and the need amongst the company to be "special".
---
Also a game with an incredibly good core of mechanics, amazing visuals, great audio design and lore. Which makes the aforementioned deficits hurt even more.
---
Just use @here. Only pings users who are online.
---
All of those things existed back in classic, and private server players very much do fall into the "optimize everything" camp. A lot of them are people who play on *every* private server, and know exactly what they need to/want to do before they even start playing because they've done it a dozen times.
---
While there definitely is a lot of nostalgiaboner stuff going on about WoW Classic, I think the people who are realistic about their expectations will enjoy it.
---
They're just hoping for a game that requires you to actually socialize with random people for groups, and have a big, active guild for end game stuff. Plus the game actually gives you a ton of incentive to play it for a lot of time - because raid gear takes a long time to get, and you need to do a lot of farming for gold, consumables, resistance gear, etc.
---
no one want to take up the challenge? Casuals...
---
Thanks
---
Yes your method works, but it's annoying to do
---
There was a force field around the house? For real? :o
---
Done, happy to help someone in the same situation as mine (academic research). I'm doing something similar but linked to microtransactions. Can I ask you what model did you use for the gaming motivation?
---
Every hetero pair gets completely overlooked because people like this view it as "normal" therefore they don't bat an eyelash at it, or they gush over how cute that asura couple is despite them not being particularly original or interesting or even having much of a personality due to them being one-off characters that never show up again.
---
But yeah the second it's a gay couple, gotta write an essay about how sjws are taking over gaming or whatever.
---
A couple of years back before PoF came out a friend of me did a challenge where we had to get to Dragon Stand, Arah and the entrance of Bitterfrost in Frostgorge with a level 2 character. With no mounts, 1hit = death this was quite a challenge and interesting enough: Arah was the hardest of the three locations to reach. Generally speaking: Climbing + gliding (invis gliding if necessary) was the most useful strategy.
---
Aw man, well you can see it on the better side (you now have 10 EU friends :D )
---
You're also able to transfer to other world/region,  in gw2 but that shouldn't be necessary for you to make friends :)
---
Anyway is still possible to chat, and feel free to do so.
---
 "I must have received the leggings before".  
---
Have you looked in your bank wardrobe to see that you've unlocked the skins?
---
That is true, however if you're actually invested in the game, buying the expansions usually is done anyway
---
Lately, I am farming black lion keys as I complete the maps of Tyria. Also doing pvp reward tracks that give me these keys. I farmed 15 keys until now. I intend to use them when I get 25/30 keys because It rises the chance of getting better loot. Playing PVP is also rewarding if play a lot. U can get nice skins.
---
Yep, it's one of the strongest skills in a firebrands kit, even without the cooldown reduction.
---
Please pm me your address and I'll ship a brand new g600 mouse to you. It has 12 macro buttons and scroll wheel tilt. (left + right click to move forward, left tilt for left sidestep, right tilt for right sidestep, mouse middle click for reverse, then you have 12 thumb buttons for your weapon skills + utilities.)
---
Yeah, you could do bosses with 8 Weavers or any to dps classes but in pugs, less experienced and less talented groups you might have an harder time than with those players on other classes (the pull that kill could be faster with weaver but the number of pull needed might be higher and overall time higher to achieve the kill). Let be honest, a lot of players wouldnt reach higher dps with weaver than there main classes and wouldnt be able to give support at the same time. I speak about "casual" raiders here. Those players that have experience with fight, there classes and that did good dps but not the 99 percentale dps. Personnaly, I will never force someone in my statics to play an higher Dps classes that he didnt master because by my experience a squad with each members mastering is role and classes will achieve smoother and easier clean than better composition but lower mastering of role and classes.
---
Btw, yeah engie could bring nice support in dps role: condi cleanse with healing turret, high vulnerabilities pressure and he can be an really selfish dps like Reaper if you need to do mecanics  that need you not being stacks and keep good boons uptime.
---
For scourge on Xera, you can epi for easier cleaning, you can help condi cleanse and even stronger you can pull condition on yourself and transfer them to Xera. With tactics like condition transfer, I can deal insane amount of damage if you time team condi cleanse correctly. 
---
On earth, you could bring Poison cloud for projectile protection, stability and/or sand swell for hand phases. For CM or even none CM, Sand swell over the narrow plaform can really make life easier for the squad. You can be on pillars duty too without losing dps.

On Air, Poison cloud can help for projectile block on last phase, high CC help too and barrier help healer so you could always use the strategie to stack all togheter to get statics charge faster and increase overall dps. Sure the stack tactic can be done with 2 healer only too but it put more pressure on them and could be hard to achieve if healer are less experience.
---
On Quadim, I was more thinking about Epi to kill adds (those CCable adds at second mini bosses and during Quadim phase the golem protector that CC everyone around if not kill).
---
Overall, I personnaly prefer classes/builds that could achieve some kinds of support and Dps because anyway I rarely raid with the 1% that could achieve top rotation so the different in Dps is really negligeable between same players playing both builds. Btw I dont talk about people doing 5k dps but people that achieve around 50 percentale on there classes. With this Dps you could easily do all bosses with even agressive dps. One pillars phase Earth, Air without killing adds or just the first one, etc...
---
Stop thinking that you need the top Dps classes and composition to achieve Smooth Raid bosses kill. Just select good player that master there roles/classes for the bosses and be sure your comp have what it need (boonwise, buffwise, survivability, etc...).
---
Please just.. Don't bother replying to this person. There are insufferable assholes in dire need of life lessons. Hope that one gets them soon.
---
&gt; The Gen 2 legendaries take almost two stacks of them to make so their prices skyrocketed.
---
This is not entirely correct.
---
They need at least 1 stack but they don't necessarily require 2 stacks.
---
Sounds good, I’ll DMypu my user name when I get back home
---
That's a fair point, specially in mmos where you invest so much time and grind, the feel/fear of it ending or being wasted can be pretty hard to accept.
---
Caring about a hobby with a competitive aspect = you need to re-evaluate your life. Nice one dude.
---
Yeah, they did but this is the treasury. You can't withdraw from it.
---
It could be a graphical bug / desync. Chances are that it fixed itself when they reopened the tab.
---
When looking at an individual this is true but talking about a market as a whole and trying to explain why the price has increased it’s okay to say they require nearly two stacks.
---
It depends. It can be 50x or even 300x the price if you pick the right time to make the comparisons. Which is all to say that making that sort of comparison without considering other factors is all bullshit.
---
You spammed too much CC on it. If his skill to call wolves get interrupted at any point, even if the wolves do apepar, he may be stuck with the shield.
---
He will also bug out of you defeat him too fast, the event will fail.
---
They may be bugs, but they are still fair punishment for impatience.
---
Wow that's super sweet thank you!

Removed: Exploits. Asked nicely the other day, unfortunately you decided to make a new account to start posting these.

My record for making it to DS is level 3 with 11 deaths (also a ranger). If you have leyline gliding, use the leylines to get as high as you can. The hardest part is right where the leylines end in Ogre Lane-- you want to take the path on the left that takes you up, but there are 2 chak that you need to be concerned about (at least 1 is a lobber, the other is either a lurker which is easily sidestepped or a zapper, which will be much more difficult, but can be dodged. Continue up the path, across the gap, and to the updrafts and you'll be home free. There is no easy route through dragon's passage, but it is possible.
---
Considering win trading is such a minuscule issue and involves such a minuscule population (literally statistically insignificant), and you are this upset over it...yes, I'd say you don't realize how seriously you take it yourself.

You being upset over my statement is also enough proof of how seriously you take it.

I guess you really live up to your name.

what's AP?
---
My post isnt about the policy, just the variance in how it is applied. It is a warning to others that a joke in lfg for a few minutes is actionable by Anet to be considered a minor offense when there have been more blatant posts in the past that have existed much longer and been more egregious.
---
I enjoy my story, thank you very much. Please leave the decision how I enjoy  MMOs to myself.
---
I don't think you know what my name actually means. ⚆_⚆
---
It takes slightly higher than average IQ to realize it - so, don't feel bad.
---
Yeah they do and I don't think that would work in GW2 with masteries and the dozens(?) of level 80 maps already made. That being said, they could still pump gear stats up. For ascended and legendary there could be a separate upgrading process to bring them to the new cap so it isn't pure obsoletion.
---
This would be breaking one of their longest standing promises so it will never happen but I think I would have preferred this from the beginning than the stagnating sideways progression that exists now
---
Ah, i wasn't aware someone had already posted something similar!
---
Thanks for the video :)
---
I'm so glad that ANet is protecting me from meme LFG posts so I can spend more time being told how to kill myself after not doing well enough at PvP (:
---
Thanks for all the respnces. I'm glad to know that I'm not the only lunatic in this game! I never bothered to get leyline gliding, but perhaps that's the answer so that will give me something to work on.
---
You are such a cunt. jesus
---
You can wait for Chak Gerent meta to end, that will open another portal to Dragon Stand behind the wall with chests.
---
So what change would you suggest making to Thief / Daredevil profession mechanics so that they both feel unique and indepedently worth playing? Because as it stands I'm not seeing a lot of reason to play Thief when Daredevil exists.
---
As you level up you'll start seeing more options for dailies (up to 12, four per game mode). I think the full range is available starting at level 31. So keep playing, today's selection may be unlucky but it won't be a problem anymore at higher levels.
---
yea dont let the horrible comments bother you, it's pretty common. miserable people trying their best to spread misery to others
---
Man, I miss GW1 trading ;_;
---
I know AH/TP is convenient but trading with real people instead of menus felt so much engaging. I miss old mmos ;_;
---
You're mixing up my confusion as to why you're being such an insufferable cuck with me being upset.
---
No problem, it's probably one of the strongest DPS builds right now with that zeal buff.
---
I definitely do. It's something my DnD group has used for years, though I'm certain one of us picked it up from somewhere else.
---
Considered watching a movie instead of some cutscenes? Please leave me my gameplay.
---
If he reclasses to ele he could play guild wars while practicing to become a rap god.
---
You admitted, and then felt the need to follow up with a defensive excuse. Do you understand that?
---
It's all fun and games until... they turn against us! I mean, people speculate that Aurene absorbing too much power might backfire. On the other hand, Kormir worked fine... at least until she decided to sh*t on us a few hundreds years later.
---
Saturday evening is when I first tried, and it seemed the same all weekend, so unfortunately I don't think it's going to get better if that is the best time for it. It seemed like nobody/no commander even made an attempt to get near an enemy keep, so that's why I've been a little discouraged with that one. 
---
Damn, that's quite a bit more expensive than I was expecting just to change server, and that's if I get it right the first time. I dread to think how much it would cost me total to find one I'm happy with if I'm unlucky. I'm in the UK, so any server in Europe that speaks English will do. At this point, I'm willing to consider a laid-back/friendly atmosphere in chat as an unnecessary bonus (one guy was bitching the whole time, during all 3 sessions I had over the weekend, and I have no idea if that's normal for WvW or not). Though I'm still not sure if I'm going to want to pay out that much just to try a mode I might not even like.
---
You're right, there was absolutely nobody in EotM, but judging from that attitude I saw in map chat, I doubt I'll be able to convince anyone to join me. 
---
Great, that simplifies that one quite a bit. I was running a support Firebrand build, so not very useful at killing things, but I might head back with my Daredevil and see if I can get this part checked off. 
---
What do you mean by international server? I thought all servers were accessible from all places. If that isn't the case, then was it some kind of glitch that put me on German national server even though I'm not in Germany? Is there a way to tell the difference between national and international servers (I don't want to keep wasting money switching)?
---
Yeah, also Red Circle bad. I used to Tank in ESO and WoW, I'm amazed that people don't know that one by now.
---
Other thing to remember: Capture Points ticking is most of your score at the end, try to fight on enemy points so they can be neutralized before the fight ends, and try to engage and hold enemies off your points.
---
It’s just an adorable little sketch, why are you so negativ :/

Now that you mention them... I don't like that Charrs turned into some steampunk mad bombers.

Don't be. It's an great adventure and an unique experience. Go for your own, at your own pace and have fun doing it :)

Hope you burn mordremoth with that ferocious dps soon!
---
Happens to MMOs after 7+ years. Wanna stand out? Dress plain.
---
Related follow up: It's okay to leave a point neutral if enemies are incoming that can wipe you out fast, getting a little progress won't slow them down much but you dying hurts your whole team.

&gt; Watch the map so you don't get into 5v1 engagements 
---
this is both true and false depending which side you are on but in an ideal match that is true :)
---
Thank you guys. I posted a bug report in the forums. Lets hope, this gets fixed with the next fix-patch. Special thanks to @OkamiWhitewings i quoted you in my bug report.
---
Sometimes it’s better to decap a point and then leave than to full cap it, especially if your team is losing somewhere else on the map and needs your help. It takes twice as long to cap a point as to decap so you can dick over the enemy +1 by decapping and then leaving if time is short.
---
What? You saying some famous streamers who got themselves permanently banned from ranked queueing yet they still queue on their alts didn't get punished enough? 
---
How dare you.
---
&gt; I think his reading of it is more accurate than yours.

This is why you're average, at best.

Wouldn’t last long and you’d probably get banned if it were possible.  So it’s for the best ;)

This fucking post lmao
---
yes but the original comment was Guild Wars players **as a whole combined**, it doesn't matter if it is in the hands of a scrub or a TP Vet.
---
You should see the forums, literally everyone asking the wrong questions or post opinions that dont meet the positivity requirements is getting thrown out and the whole place feels like a concentration camp, more so than usual as there's this period of zero communication :x
---
For me is gameplay even randomly walking around maps, team up with random players, talk with them. You know, stuff that you do in mmo. or jsut doing pvp, wvw, working towards legendaries, and so on. 
---
Your idea what you can do is quite tunnel-visioned I fear.
---
Or have a better loot system?
---
daily reminder that the existence of *toxic* in everyday internets is an argument for why eugenics is just.
---
The future of the game is in limbo right now.  Sure they just pushed the latest raid and living story a couple months ago, but it was written as a finale.  A lot of world bonus events feel like the sort of thing you do before putting a game on maintenance mode.  We have no idea what comes next.  There's no roadmap, no teasers, nothing to let us know if the game is going to be supported moving forward.
---
It's certainly not a debacle where people should be fleeing for other games, but we certainly aren't in a place where players are excited for the future of the game.
---
No, supply was limited way more strictly than before, and demand was increased a lot more than twice. If there's a recipe that requires x coins and then a new recipe that requires 2x coins, your demand isn't doubled, because the old recipe still exists. And as YetOneMoreBob pointed out, they also added collections for skins that require them, further increasing demand. That's not to say market players don't have a role, but theirs has more to do with fluctuation. Overall increase in price is pretty well supported by regular supply and demand.
---
And pvp.., and WvW. But at least open world is happy!
---
True, i remember the time shortly after PoF release where we played games with up to 3 Scourges per team. It was just ridiculous.
---
&gt; keep doing what you're doing and regret the time and energy you wasted being upset over all of it later in life 
---
Amusingly said by the person who decided to take time out of their day to respond to just about every comment on this.
---
If you actually look at the thread that is linked, a lot of people actually think that GW2 is a good game in that thread. They are offering legitimate critique (lack of raid content, lack of content in general,ect), but it doesn't mean they are \*slamming\* the game. If you also look through the OP's post you can pretty clearly see the issues he has with the game. They are all pretty reasonable. Lack of raid content, lack of depth in living world updates, and the poor state of PvP/ WvW. (All of these things are pretty objective and hard to dispute)  He might be a bit malicious with his intent for the thread, but there are real feedback points in there that shows that he cares enough to post them.
---
&gt; ow just opening the FFXIV subreddit I see: Guild Wars 2 Refugees coming to FFXIV . I get it, 
---
Do you? In both cases it seems more like a small group of people making a lot of noises.
---
or more rudely, a minority that thinks they represent a majority
---
Now if they just ban sellers for raids we might have a working LFG again.
---
It gets much faster at max level because you have way more buttons to press, even with 2.5sec GCD. Before that some of the classes can be real slog and around level 30, almost every one of them. I'd say that's the main issue with FF14 as new player, it's quite hard to get into, especially since you are forced to do main story as well.
---
Well pm nothing I’ve tried helps, but I will look into that. I can’t even hope to have a life without pain at this point, it’s too emotionally painful. I’d almost rather accept that I’ll never get better and that I just need to find ways to manage it. Sometimes it just feels like too much though. Idk sorry for dumping my life story on you lmao
---
WvW does not get much because they are working on the alliance system right now which they said will take take to develop, for pvp I can´t say much because I do not play pvp but yes open world is probably the most played game mode, of course they deliver for that.
---
What is the MF% threshold for salvaging/identifying the unidentified gear rather than selling it on the TP?
---
So as someone who just sorta jumps between both games and only recently started to notice the migrating players, I don't think it's anywhere near that point.  
---
There is a good chunk of players leaving for FFXIV right now, which is understandable.  GW2 is in a drought, FFXIV just dropped an incredibly expansion and has been getting a lot of publicity, especially after the giant wave of players they got from WoW relatively recently.  This is something pretty much bound to happen, people tend to duck out in content droughts and go to popular games.  GW2 isn't a sub game, so some of those will likely come back to the game as new updates come out.  It might not be many of those peoples main MMO anymore, but GW2 can survive on people playing it as a side game.
---
A lot of raiders are leaving GW2 right now due to the lack of real raid content released in the game.  GW2 doesn't really have a lot difficult instanced content to offer.  Fractals are relatively short and take a long time to release, and raids... well sorta the same thing, once every 9 months is pitiful and the overall size of said raids are tiny.  
---
Anet has some options to try to recapture those people, but honestly once they drop some more content a good portion of people will probably jump back to try it out.  Will they make GW2 their main MMO?  Maybe, maybe not.  If they get used to the extra content release schedule they will probably stay with FFXIV, and honestly GW2 can't compete with that and nor should they even try.  They have a strong niche in the B2P market, they cant compete with a sub game in content delivery.  As for the raiders... I don't think that part of the community will really recover to be honest.  The raiding community has already been small and if they lose more people its only going to get harder to form raids, which of course will lead to more people leaving from said community, ect.  They could try to devlop with more of a focus on the raid content, but honestly they would probably be better off just letting it go.  GW2 just isn't a raiding MMO.  The raids are fun, but if that's your focus they don't have a lot of content in that area to deliver.  It's fine for GW2 just to embrace it's role as a casual MMO, at least on the PvE side.
---
Honestly though theres just a lot of uncertainty with the layoffs that happened a while back that has people thinking of jumping ship.  People always assume the worse when theres a lack of infromation.  The best thing Arenanet can do at this point is communicate.  Come out with a detailed list of what their plans are for the next couple quarters with predicted release windows of what content and such to show that the game is still being supported.  I do think they should put more focus on WvW as well too, it's become a bit of a meme with how little support it gets yet it's one of the biggest things GW2 has thats unique, and again they need to embrace their niche.
---
There is no
---
Yeah like I said I won’t be engaging anymore. Im too busy replying to nice encouraging people haha. I totally agree tho. There really are some people who just haven’t been through enough to know how hard life can get. Or, they’ve been through so much they’re jaded and turned their emotions off long ago. I did that but then I couldn’t feel happy either and I want to appreciate life. If that means I also have to hurt...then so be it.
---
MMOs are locked in an eternal war where one can't even be remotely "good" without all of the others being "garbage."
---
The fact is that people get bored of any game, whether its in 2 months or 7 years depends on the person. Whether that person has a YouTube channel or only plays with friends doesn't necessarily matter, because when they quit they will give a reason why. And that reason will be used by the community of other games as gospel.
---
You can admit why you love a game and why you are sticking around, but that won't draw as many upvotes from the blind patriotism of competing games.
---
How many languages do you speak, UnusualFreelancer? It must be a lot because you're so smart.
---
I think this is less about the drought and more about the absolute silence of the future of the game. 
---
Yes we heard we have LS5. But we learned that almost year ago (and we still haven’t gotten into LS5). Then you tack on theory’s that anet has moved on from GW2, which was later confirmed with layoffs. 
---
Then Anet goes back into the same cycle of silence (after saying they are back), which makes an already nervous base more nervous they have moved on again. 
---
If your significant other said they cheated on you, then said they were 100% committed, just to start showing signs of cheating again months later, how else would you react?
---
So let's hear your idea for a loot system where the top tier of gear will never be owned by more than a single digit number of accounts, no matter how long the game runs for.
---
Join a guild? Someone might want to free up their storage space?
---
FFXIV and GW2 are both incredibly different when it comes to release schedule and overall gameplay concepts, yet they feel very, very similar in a lot of ways.
---
This just comes down to the monetization, really. FFXIV subs mean you can push content at a more regular pace, and the playerbase there is interested in slightly different things than folks here - it's clear that GW2 players are more achievement and collection-oriented (See: Fashion Wars) and interested in story content (at least in general,) whereas FFXIV is a raid/hardcore endgame player's utopia. GW2 monetization is in no means bad, but the development team is also smaller here, so while we do get really good content, it's spread out a bit more.
---
And, really? That's not a bad thing, and honestly makes the games great to play in tandem with one another - or just picking the one that you prefer to play, if you aren't looking to get into two MMO's at once. While they are both in the same genre as MMOs, it doesn't mean they have to directly compete, and I think GW2 and FFXIV are the best examples of MMOs that can coexist.
---
Both are fairly friendly to casuals and easy to get into, while GW2 doesn't expect you to login every single day and no life things - it's more play at your own pace, explore what you want, set your own goals sort of game. FFXIV, on the other hand, will scratch that progression and grinding itch.
---
On top of that, they tend to have alternating release schedules, so when there's a lull in content in one, there's likely something new an exciting in the other (ie the new FFIXV expac, Shadowbringers, coming out this summer, in the lull between Living World seasons and other hardcore/competitive releases.
---
So, to answer the title? No, Guild Wars 2 is not a meme. We're in our drought, our lull, between seasons, and that's not as bad or uncommon as some folks make it out to be. FFXIV had their drought too, leading up to Shadowbringers. It happens, because the devs just finished a few major releases and need some time to prep for the next one. 
---
Some players just have more free time and have already achieved all they want in GW2, so they're looking for something to move onto, or to fill the time until we get a new season or expansions!
---
I still think there's room for some sort of sub model. I think they tested the waters with the armory pack, and due to no recent rendition, I'm assuming they're reworking the package or have scrapped it. 
---
Personally, if GW2 was pumping out something other than Living Story and delivered a bit more for its end game (frac, dung, raid, pvp, wvw, erp) I'd pay $15 a month. I shit out $15 a month. Minimum wage is $11 where I live. I could donate blood even haha, or mow a lawn - clean a grandma's kitchen in my undies. Exchange some GBP i dont know.
---
If you dont't want to commit, cool. The thing is, I do and I can. Just make it worth the commitment Anet. Make this MMO the game it was always supposed to be.
---
&gt;  but these raiders behave like the whole game is dead because of it.
---
Well it is. 
---
They aren't interested in afking meta events or farming trashmobs for gold. So to them the game is dead.
---
Thanks! I was able to add a few people in game/on discord so that’s good :)
---
I might just be real honest when I join another guild and they welcome. Say something like “sorry if I’m quiet later but I have trouble inserting myself and have social anxiety” to make them aware. I just have to keep telling myself if they think it’s weird or annoying then they’re not worth my time anyway. Thanks!!!!
---
You're right.
---
I should ignore people of lower intellect, and give them less of my time.
---
Let me start with you.
---
I did not tell anyone to kill themselves and phrasing my offense as such is dishonest. I dont need to prove myself to anyone, especially on Reddit, but to help you understand, another player used the word "Sudoku" instead of "Seppuku." I said that you might mean Seppukku in the context that he said "Im going to commit sudoku" by means of LFG.
---
If I said this irl, would you scream at me that I am endorsing suicide? Or that I am supportive of it? Of course not, because you understand the difference between clarity and endorsement. I think....
---
I don't think there's any variance in how their policy is applied; this seems to have less to do with their LFG Tool policy and more to do with their Rules of Conduct (specifically the first one):
---
 [https://www.guildwars2.com/en/legal/guild-wars-2-rules-of-conduct/](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/legal/guild-wars-2-rules-of-conduct/) 
---
Your comment about Seppuku might have been intended as a joke but that's something they would take action on immediately if they see it or if it's reported.
---
took close to 20k hours to get first pre as a drop, not from forge gambling
---
Yup, was gonna post this. I bought an earth sigil last week anticipating the spike when the build becomes more well-known.
---
Guys this is fine!
---
Remember, there is nothing wrong with the game, entire communities leaving GW2 isn't just fine but GOOD because fuck them for wanting development or communication, and if anyone even mentions Anet and content in the same sentence they are literally Hitler anyways.
---
Asherons Call did it from November 99 till January 2017 flawlessly.  Everyone had customized armor because the best armor was loot generated and then customized with hundreds of hours worth of effort to complete, and character specific.  Very few people were running around in the same gear unless it was like level 50 quest armor to get you to level 75.  
---
Also it took years for the general population to max out a character, and very few characters had the exact same setup after you take all the different stuff into account.  Once everyone started maxing out the characters they upped it in an expansion and added years of character growth and progression to the game.  Though end game was more than fashion wars so the growth was never really stagnant, but people like watching their stats grow.  
---
Best part is they did it all with out the stat inflation suffered by all modern MMOs.
---
Just because youve been fed a certain thing so that they can cookie cut shit and hold your hand through your mmos to ensure your dopamine hit doesnt mean that there is only one way to skin that cat.
---
thank you for the tip
---
Well, casual community will stay. Thats the core playerbase of gw2, right? Right?  Who needs them raiders. Or all more or less dedicated players. They are toxic and all.
---
Personally I dislike ff14 so I'll just look if wow classic bombs (I kinda expect it to, or to go in some completely retarded direction) and if so, I think we can all admit that full fledged mmorpgs are dead as a genre.
---
Sry didn't understand what do you mean?
---
u can change server on character select screen 2 times in a day as a guest.

Start thinking about farming when you're lvl80 and have a fully geared character.  
---
For now try to do your dailies, it's 2 gold a day. This day was unlucky, but by the time you're 80 you should have a bit of money saved up. ☺
---
The idea that only raiders have quit is a bit of a meme. My raid guild is ironically the only thing still around, whilst everyone else has moved onto FFXIV or just quit.
---
you need to reach lvl 80 first, and have like 10 gold starting money to get exotic weapons and some armor off the trading post. 
---
then google "silverwastes farming", there's plenty of guides online that will teach you the specifics
---
it's a fun mmo, but it's a different kind of mmo. more of a traditional grind mmo with the constant vertical progression ladder. is anyone actually surprised that a new game or a game with a new expansion sees a spike in popularity? op and linked thread are just trying to frame it in a doom and gloom
---
definitely worth trying out if you're into final fantasy stuff, still worth checking out if you just like trying different MMOs out in general. note: if you play really casually you might feel like your monthly sub is being wasted after you hit level cap.
---
the loyalty/bashing is just standard social identity bullshit people do because god forbid someone has different tastes than you
---
&gt; 2-3 month is nothing new and out of the ordinary.
---
At this point, living story barely even counts as content to a large portion of the playerbase. If we look past the LS, what else is there?
---
No WvW content since 2015. Biggest change in years was the Warclaw which nobody asked for and is widely criticized. Anet's busy working on alliances which will do nothing for the gamemode.
---
1 new PvP map in almost 3 years. Game is barely playable because of the powercreep, most people at the top quit, and the meta's been the same since 2017 (same as WvW). As far as we know, they are working on Swiss which affects a few dozen people, possibly even in a negative way.
---
In terms of endgame PvE content we are getting closer to 1 raid wing and 1 fractal per year. Both are cleared 2 hours from release. I'm not even going to mention dungeons for obvious reasons.
---
Last meta event that was considered to be hard anc challenging was probably in HoT, 2015. We've been spamming 11111 eversince.
---
But yeah, game is doing great and there's so much to do..
---
\&gt; Game dies because we don't have even a hint of an upcoming expansion for years, and the devs decide to focus on a poorly written story over actually engaging content
---
\&gt; releases expansion, surge of players that they fail to capture because of severe content drought
---
\&gt; makes shitty bite-sized story updates with bad writing for a year driving players away once again.
---
\&gt; oops
---
\&gt; releases second expansion, surge of mostly happy players.
---
\&gt; Once again goes back to shitty bite-sized story updates driving players away.
---
\&gt; "I guess expansions don't work, let's try Living story again for the fifth time!"
---
Anet is spinning plates and dropping half of them.
---
After the latest patch you want them to push MORE content more frequently?
---
Can you pm me an invite? Can't accept it for some reason from mobile. Thanks!
---
I find the entire idea of raiding in GW2 weird, honestly. I raided a ton in WoW and FFXIV, but GW2 is missing a lot of fundamental systems that make progression raiding what it is and more raid content wont ever fix them. I actually play GW2 more overall than other MMOs, but I can't see myself putting any further effort towards raids.
---
In FFXIV/WoW having raids that &lt;0.1% of people can clear in the first month is totally fine, because as a patch cycle goes people's ilevel goes up and it becomes gradually easier. Next content cycle bumps up item levels and now a lot more people can do it. Earlier raids become easier until even very casual guilds (or even casual pug groups) can start clearing them. This means most raid content will eventually get seen by a lot of people even if on a big delay and they can tune new stuff extremely tightly so progression raiders can bust their heads on it. FFXIV goes a step further than item level by giving echo bonus (+stats every time you wipe to a certain cap) to old content.
---
Guild Wars doesn't have that - maybe new elite specs or stat combos will powercreep a bit, but ultimately player power doesn't reliably go up. However many people are good enough to beat the content will do so almost immediately, and those who aren't good enough just wont. Which means raids will always either be tuned difficult (and thus a tiny portion of people will see/do the content and make it unworth making) or easy (a lot more people will see/do the content but it kills any idea of progression raiding and hurts the reason to do static parties).
---
I could also go on about how FFXIV primarily (and WoW to a lesser extent) do a tremendously better job of converting casuals into casual raiders into effort raiders through their systems that GW2 also completely lacks but this is already going on a bit.
---
TLDR - I'm surprised there's so much raider complaining because I'm surprised the raiding scene even still exists in GW2.
---
Dude, it's the internet. And a shitty sub at that. Do you really expect them to have a bit more than two brain cells? All they know is pitchforks and bandwagons.
---
Gw2 has been the meme for years, go to literally any other mmo subreddit stream or youtube video and the moment Gw2 is mentioned in any way everyone laughs and rightfully so.
---
The Norn and the Kodan might even be related, so there could be more interactions there, which would be cool.
---
The problem is, in my opinion, that there are extremely huge expectations on the next LS release because it's the first release that kinda needs to prove that we didn't need an expansion after LS4. I predict that they'll fail at proving it. 
---
The fact that we still don't have a full transparency on what A.Net is working (besides GW2), doesn't help either.
---
You say gw2 doesn't ask you to do nolife things, yet it's method of grinding gold is one of the worst. Just run around pressing 1 while listening to spotify or watching youtube. ANet even promote 'boss rush' as an actual 'special event'.
---
&gt; We have no idea what comes next. There's no roadmap, no teasers, nothing to let us know if the game is going to be supported moving forward.  
---
Wat. We absolutely know what's coming next. Season 5. Why are you acting like they haven't said anything?
---
&gt;  an LS episode with one of the best repeatable metas
---
It is only popular due to amount of loot players get from it. It's not even close to HoT metas.
---
As a thief player, any GCD is a terrible thing
---
And whilst they're at it, allow us to disable profession mechanic visuals, such as the beastmode aura, revenant legend wrist aura etc. If the end game is fashion, as you say, then removing these should be an option as well.
---
Just some notes for this that you may want to investigate. First, your age categories overlap. If someone is 20 years old, they could technically answer for two age groups. The groupings are also fairly arbitrary and, if possible, you should just ask for numerical age. Second, you have a LOT of open-ended questions with a great deal of variance in answers. I would not trust the reliability of this research because you could get people answering the same question in different ways. Like, I've filled it out, and I'm sure if you gave it to me again I would select different answers. This is a particular problem if your group is answering questions in the middle of your likert scales, as these little drifts can skew your data in unpredictable ways. Try and make your answers as quantifiable as possible, or consider getting into qualitative research instead as your questions seem more attuned to that type of research (and we need more of it!).
---
That would be cool but Id rather them tone it down a bit. Not remove it but just not make it take up so much empty space.
---
I'd say depending on the content you want to do, GW2 is more of a potential grind than ffxiv. Heaviest grind on ffxiv is maybe a few days if you actively grind and most of it can be done casually in a few weeks, setting aside the fact that the things you actually have to grind for are for looks only. Meanwhile the vertical progression ladder for gear isn't bad.   
---
The most recent release, Eden first raid tier normal, takes maybe an hour of your day and you're done for the week, getting 1-4 pieces of gear of your choice depending on what drops you chose. The tomestone gear that's releasing soon is weekly capped as well, capping usually at 450 or 900, either of which can be reached in a couple days doing 2 hours of content via content roulettes.   
---
FFXIV really isn't much of (and never really has been) a grind unless you absolutely want it to be. This coming from someone who has been playing for nearly 3 years now. I'm not gonna bash anyone for not liking it but to call it a grinding mmo is just outright incorrect.
---
Meh. All you people with your reasonable requests. :D

It's easy my little brother gets hero points on brand new lvl 2 characters all the time, and when I made a ranger he got me all the pets from both expansions
---
&gt; Raids? Is that part of the roadmap? 
---
I honestly don't understand why Anet don't just introduce a monthly reset on CMs, so that you actually have a reason to repeat them for the same rewards, as opposed to doing them once at minimum and never touching them again. Not only would it potentially solve the *ludicrous* price of power food, it'd also be a relatively super easy way to introduce a little bit more content. 
---
It's not a complete solution by any means, obviously, but imo it'd be one of those small changes that help stem the content drought until we get something more
---
I know if I had to start guild wars and start grinding out stories and that stuff I’d hate the game a lot more than if I just spent time farming gold. I guess it’s a personal preference thing.
---
The memers become the memed.
---
*somethingsomethingdeadgaem*
---
Okay. And so was Auric Basin and Istan and Silverwastes yet those kept people playing. It's also entirely a matter of subjective opinion as to what makes a good meta so you don't really have much of a point to make here. 
---
Have a lovely evening, but if you won't out the effort in to address my points, neither will I. People aren't going to want to discuss with you if you move the goal posts.
---
I can't see how PoF was an improvement over HoT, besides broken promises over legendary weapons. If anything, it demonstrated Anet's change of heart, as it was clearly meant for the casual player base; also we've had countless additional unfulfilled and scrapped commitments along the way. Everyone talks about the post HoT content drought but raid wings poured like rain for a good 6 months, which kept the player base busy for at least a year, not to mention how abundant HoT was in terms of content compared to PoF. Repetitive content is bad, neglected, not a priority anymore, because it's not worth it
---
They're also required for guild halls.  Specifically the war room.
---
Things like PvP and fractals make you absurd amounts of money and isn't "running around pressing 1."
---
Yeah, it has a stable population of people with low enough standards that LS is enough for them.
---
The people with higher standards leave after the expansion's content has dried up. 
---
You can look at any game and see a constant population and profitability from that group, espeically in free 2 play games. I mean fucking Allods online is still running. That doesn't mean the game couldn't do things better. You may like the Living Story, that doesn't mean it's the right call to keep running on that treadmill.
---
&gt; Okay. And so was Auric Basin and Istan and Silverwastes yet those kept people playing. It's also entirely a matter of subjective opinion as to what makes a good meta so you don't really have much of a point to make here.
---
I clearly stated my opinion is based on gameplay aspects of the event. You can declare you love dragonfall, because you get obnoxious loot from it. But don't pretend that this meta is in any way complicated or engaging. Killing purple pimples on a rock is hardly an adventure.
---
Yes!
---
or just use it....
---
Np about the life story. i feel sorry for you, that you have to go through all that. Specially at your age. Like i said before, never give up! Never surrender!
---
Bless was a total shit show though. I bought it to try and refunded within 2 hours.
---
Clearly they have this tech since we have the killing and resing ones from the Skyscale collection.
---
&gt; The layoffs were all on projects that were not Guild Wars 2 
---
Except they weren't. They lost a number of senior employees that we know were still working on GW2.
---
Oh yeah, I don't doubt it! There's room for casuals in FFXIV, just as there is some amount of room for hardcore players in GW2 as well. While FFXIV's story was never my cup of tea, I did still enjoy it for what it was, and I've even done some RP in the game.
---
I'm mostly just speaking to the general development focus and overall... Perception, I suppose? From my experience (and I'm sure this varies from person to person, depending on what you prefer and what news outlets or marketing blurbs you see,) FFXIV is more of a WoW competitor with a gear treadmill, raids, etc., and the majority of its players (certainly not all) are in it for those epic raid bosses.
---
Guild Wars 2, on the other hand, markets itself a lot more casually, and those who stick around to play are often those invested in the story or smaller-scale, more casual content (open world PvE comes to mind before raids, PvP, and WvW in this game.) There are definitely folks who no life GW2 and play hardcore, aiming to clear raids the day they come out and weekly thereafter, but unlike FFXIV I feel those players are far from the majority! :)
---
Let people selling raids is okay?
---
Anet doesn't want people to know the game exists. LW is the perfect way to update the game without causing any news.
---
I'm GameCubeGaff.8174
---
So the solution is to delete the spec? He literally said in his post the build was too strong. Jesus christ use your brain.
---
It's just because xiv had a new expansion recently. As with every game ever, a new shiny release brings people back for a while, and then the honeymoon phase passes and they might realise why they stopped playing in the first place, and then they move on again. Repeat forever. 
---
I wouldn't say this says anything about the future of gw2 other than that xiv released content between gw2's releases.
---
Oooo... this is intriguing. Thanks for that. I'll see if I can find it.
---
Look. As long as Anet cannot only get away with doing less than the bare minimum, but actually get praised for doing anything at all, they won't change. They don't feel the need to communicate, they don't think they need to generate hype, and they don't think they need to develope content. 
---
The only way to change this is to stop praising Anet until they deserve it.
---
There's always "refugees" fleeing certain mmos to others.
---
It's happened so often now that it's lost its shock value, especially since GW2 is still one of the most populated mmos. Not like we're Bless or something.
---
This, so much.  Anet going silent again has been so frustrating; shortly after the layoffs, when we started getting teasers for War Eternal, and got that big info-dump of "here's all the stuff we're working on", I thought maybe Anet was revisiting their communications strategy. Apparently that was just a one-off thing, sadly.  
---
Compare to DE's communication for Warframe: in Warframe, we know what the next *three* whole major content updates are going to be.  We know we're getting a new cinematic quest first, we know the main theme of that story is going to be "family", and we know it's going to come with a new tile set (which we've seen previews of, and it looks amazing).  We know after that, we're getting Empyrean, a new mode, with new progression, and all-new systems, that will hopefully provide a "glue", bringing together many of the game's disparate systems.  Finally, we have a trailer for a new update after that, that promises some major revelations in the story.  That's all *massive* stuff, and it's super exciting. Compare that to Guild Wars 2: we only know that Living Story Season 5 is coming.  We don't know what it will contain, beyond the super vague "expansion-level features".  We don't even have a teaser for where the story is going.  We don't know if there will be an expansion afterwards.  Hell, we don't even know if it will require owning the previous expansions. Surely enough of S5E1 is done that they could at least give us a peek?
---
I'm not asking for Anet to post the script for Season 5's story, but it would be nice if we could get a teaser trailer, and some high-level overview of what Anet hopes Season 5 will be.  Just *something* to look forward to, to give us a reason to be excited.
---
To me it seems like they're trying to fish in a super deep ocean with 2 feet of line. They clearly have a lot of things they wish they could do but don't have the time or budget. This is evident in things like the Malyck story which they tried to include in HoT but in the end it had to be cut.
---
It's not just skyscale that does this.  Sometimes on other mounts I come back without the soulbeast merge for whatever reason.
---
It was beyond garbage in all game modes besides PvP already and wasnt even that bad in PvP. It was annoying as shit but not that oppressive.
---
I didn't know that people played Firebrand as a DPS. It seems so much more suited as a support, and it works great as one.
---
There's room for both. They are doing some things right and some things wrong. Acting like everything is wrong won't make things right any faster.
---
But do not forget in 95% of the time, it is better to loose the capture point than dying on it.
---

---
Oh well, it's not the WvW/PvP devs fault, they are some of the best people of ANet, especially BenP, he's a legend at this point.
---
Managment though, those are some idiots.
---
yes, since it is allowed.
---
That's not true - to name 3 examples, Matthew Medina, Josh Foreman and Cameron Rich were all working on the live game in the Living World, Current Events and Raid/Fractal team respectively.
---
"You just need" Don´t you think that if this was that easy anet would be still working on it?
---
Classic devs
---
You have to look at it from the project management perspective.
---
If the green aura they currently have is provided by the Beastmode effect, it cannot be too hard to tweak it to give different visuals based on the pet archetype.
---
As for the aura themselves, it'd be a matter of grabbing existing assets from existing effects: snowflakes, vines, flowers, etc, then use them to make copies of the original effects with different sprites and different color schemes.
---
I'd be less work than making something completely anew, and it would be good to have in combat for the same reasons Elementalists have wrist auras and Revenants have hand auras.
---
Why stop there? Why don't you ask ANET to hand you the a full set of leggy armour with bonus cm titles for free? Surely you are totally entitled to all the rewards since you installed the game right?
---
“Uninstall”
---
&gt;Nor does one guild and one streamer jumping ship mean the game is in trouble.
---
I agree with the sentiment but there are a lot more than one guilds jumping ship - as Derpy mentions on the linked post SC is likely leaving after ERP, but I can also tell you that LN is in a similar position to SC and dP, iS, and meta have basically already left. So that's all 5 of the top 5 guilds either going or gone and it doesn't stop there, I know of several semi-hardcore guilds that are also leaving.
---
ANET states in their LFG policy that selling a spot in a group is allowed because it's part of a group forming process. 
---
Stupid, but it's allowed. 
---

---
I tried FFXIV, since there is a free trial, and it is so dull.
---
No big deal.
---
Some players (Even streamers?) said they wanted to quit after the last balance patch where the absolutely-needed-chronomancer-yet-i-dont-want-to-play-it-because-im-locked-on-this-role has received some trade-offs, and it was like an echo chamber in the FFXIV sub. There is more raids in FFXIV they might have some fun, let those players having some fun!
---
What did the GW2 community lost? Players who keeps complaining about the chrono state, but guess what? A Chronomancer is still mandatory in every raids.
---
Personally, I think the devs didnt went far enough. Chrono was so powerful with so few trade-offs it is still not balanced yet imho, not enough risks taken for the reward. As long as the Chronomancer is mandatory in the raid scene, it could be tweaked even more.
---
And yes 9 month for a raid wing is probably too long.
---
No, the chronomancer adjustments weren't bad. Maybe the trade off was not the good one but i mean: They introduce a powerful Elite spec for group play add mechanics in that way, why not adding or removing other mechanics in trade-off? It makes the elite spec even more special..
---
On another note, I believe that the Chrono is partly responsible of the global state of the raids, where some people find them a too easy. I mean, when your party is on steroids in casting time, CDR, and got a free global evade, a good tank, a good breakbar breaker bundled on a single elite spec... Papa chrono is on your back, stay at your spot with your rotation...
---
&gt; Or, at the very least, mention quitting as often as they can on other posts.
---
Or maybe more people are quitting the game than ever so as a result there are more posts? The same percent of the quitters are making posts only there are more quitters.
---
Amen.
---
I seem to be playing ESO daily too. The amount of stuff to do each day is absurd.
---
Community is screaming loudly and what do we get in return.....crickets!
---
Blame Jessica Price how exactly? What happened with her didn't happen during an AMA. Nothing but positive things ever came out from an AMA, yet they stopped them.
---
The last post on reddit from a dev was almost two full weeks ago. A few years ago they posted almost daily. What happened? 
---
And on another note, what are Anet doing to keep the more dedicated players around? PvP has seen a new lobby and one new map in the last 2-3 years. WvW has seen some reward restructuring and a mount nobody really asked for and nobody particularly cares about. PvE players have seen subpar fractals (the last truly deep fractal came out BEFORE POF) every 6 months and a raid every 10 months that gets cleared by the hardcore the same day and by more casual players the same week (by clearing I mean normal mode and CM).
---
So what are we left with? A few hours of content every 2-3 months. What do we have to look forward to? Unknown. The last episode came out two and a half months ago and we haven't heard a beep since then. We don't know anything about Season 5. We don't know what's coming after season 5. We don't know whether this game will ever see another expansion. We can't even get confirmation that we will ever see another raid wing, since this thing has been going around that W7 was the last PoF wing, which potentially means nothing for *years to come*. Unsubstantiated rumor? Sure, except they can't even dispel that.
---
No, I am sorry, but defending Anet makes no sense to me. Sure, the game won't die with these people (me included, and yes, it's FF14) leaving, but neither will the new people stick around when they finish the current content and have *nothing to look forward to*.
---
I watched streams of it today on twitch just to see if there was anything to look forward to. I just can't see anything to keep me logging in.
---
ShockedQuaggan.png
---
You can't just go silent, specially after mass layoffs.
---
If some jerk comes here and starts screaming this game is on life support, how do you fight him back? You simply can't. It's depressing.
---
No wonder anyone who cares about GW2 is apathetic as fuck.
---
ArenaNet will kill the game through apathy alone.
---
only at the end of an encounter, like 3% boss health or whatever.
---
The Living World is this game's cancer, in many ways. Yes, it has good things, but the bad far outweigh the good.
---
Had this game stuck to expansions and dungeons back on 2013, we would be at a very different place today.
---
God, this sub is just full of doomsayer's and salty entitled players. Anything along the lines of "ANet bad/GW2 dying" is upvoted like mad and actually saying you enjoy the game it is downvoted.
---
You know who else said they were comitted to their game? Vavlve about Artifact.
---
exactly.
---
Fanboys of this game are some of the worse part of it. They think they're helping by white knighting the game, when in fact they're just driving players and healthy discussion away.
---
It's been pretty good for a long time, it just never really got changed and isn't power so people stopped talking about it.
---
FF14 is a story heavy game.   
---
Up till 50 combat will be lacking due to global cooldown, yes it's shit and it's a very well known misconception that combat is slow. I had this too.   
---
Around 50 you get the so called off global cooldown skills and the Skill Speed stat starts appearing, lowering global cooldown.   
---
That's when game starts to shine and once you reach first xpac at 60 your class will turn into something way way better.   
---
By max level (80) you will have around 30 skills and everything will feel fast and fluid.   
---
Lookup guides, videos and just play it casually till then and once you hit endgame you will see how complex rotations can get.   
---
For comparison I've been maining DH for the past year in GW2, before than i had 8k hrs on Weaver.   
---
The Job called Dragoon is very similar to DH.   
---
You have a bunch of modifier skills and you have to fit all your best skills under them.   
---
They also use a Dragon Meter which lets you use new skills to extend that Meter which in return opens up new skills and buffs others.   
---
Almost every skill has a combo effect with other skills and if done in order you get new skills, new effects and more damage.   
---
The rotation is very fast, fluid and arguably more engaging than DH in gw2.   
---
That's only 1 Job in FF14, there's way more and each play completely different and all are viable.   
---
You even get a 1% extra dmg per unique role up to 5% free damage for whole group.
---
PoF is a glorified single game. Take the mounts away, and you're left with a pointless dead expansion.
---
It's criminal they didn't bother updating it like they did with HoT.
---
Just want to correct some misinformation. Since truth is important in these discussions.
---
&gt; They won't endorse competitive community driven events,
---
If this is in reference to ERP, then ANET has personally been in contact with Mightyteapot, and offered to support his event with gemcodes and retweets. **However** since Mightyteapot wishes to use third-party apps that allow him to hack the camera for better cinematography, Arenanet cannot make an official endorsement. Instead, various developers like BenP "unofficially" donated Gold towards his prize pool. 
---
&gt; and will promote stuff like world bosses which is just 11111 a big tame thing instead of their end-game content. 
---
Unfortunately, that is because World Bosses resulted in their biggest active players number. So much so that they have had consistent success with FOUR world boss events... in a row...
---
I do agree that they should make harder world bosses, and adjust Tequatl to his LS1 difficulty.  
---
However, I must clarify that their obsession with easy world bosses isn't because of competitive mentality. It's because it's the most popular.
---
&gt;Even now you'll find lots of people who will try to convince you that introducing raids in GW2 was a mistake.
---
This is why we must change the hearts and minds of players. Because ANET is just giving players what they want.
---
just play something else 4head
---
closer to maintence mode then to active development if you ask me. Just look at FF14, they just get expansion and their devs already confirmed next one is in the works. And what we have?
---
Maybe don't hire psychopathic maniacs in the first place. Human resources isn't doing a good job if they let such toxic people in.
---
FFXIV just got a new expac, GW2 is in between releases (what's this with people acting like GW2 didn't just get a LS a raid, massive collections, and a revamped story, though? I think like to just hear about new stuff rather than actual play through content).
---
GW2 is designed to allow players to come and go without 'falling behind'. It makes sense for MMORPG players to hit up a new expansion in one game while anothet is in between releases. 
---
I see some people saying, "the future of GW2 is uncertain" even though Anet announced LS5 a LONG time ago. I thought that counted but apparently not?
---
Was talking about the previous ERP where GW2 was sitting at 4k+ viewers on twitch, 2/3rds of what the almighty FF with its new shiny expac has right now, and there wasn't a mention of it anywhere.
---
Also I don't think harder world bosses are needed, people obviously like them for what they are. But I believe Anet needs to present their end-game content to those players and to the world in a more active way.
---
This game has the best combat there is in the genre, and tens of thousands of players who would get hooked to GW2 thanks to it aren't even trying the game, because they have a wrong image of what the game is/can offer, all because of the company's philosophies and decisions.
---
Yeah... Kinda...
---
It's a fairly reliable thing by now that ~2 months after the latest major content update the subreddit shits itself inside out with "dead game" memes.
---
Walmart and Target still carry them in NA.
---
4k ultra HD.  
---
:&gt;
---
It isn't just raiders, it is everyone who plays the game  with some level of dedication. Pvp, wvw, even pve outside of raids. For example, do you know what we are celebrating in literally two days, July 25? Two years since the last CM fractal was released.  
---
Usually we get a formless blob of happy friendly casual playerbase that throw their downvote arrows at issues, but not today.
---
Who said I'm lazy? I wouldn't have nearly 10k liquid gold from farming otherwise. Nor would I be raiding nearly every day. I fought Deimos a few times last week and only one squad was good enough to get the kill.
---
Nobody except Anet knows, but there are a bunch of factors all at once and it'd be silly to think these aren't driving people away.
---
- No expansion after season 4.
---
- WvW does not see changes. PvP and WvW metas are stagnant even after the last patch.
---
- Raid wing release schedule does not exist. The last wing took 7 months (!!) to come out. Raid meta is also stagnant.
---
- Unknown whether the game will ever get another set of elite specs.
---
- Nobody knows what season 5 is going to look like, but people are understandably frustrated that living world follows a tired formula which may just end up being repeated again for another season.
---
And come back to a dead guild and no raid/fractal/wvw/pvp team? Just because you come back the 20 other people got told to quit have no guarantee of returning.
---
&gt; LW is the perfect way to update the game without causing any news
---
This is what drives me insane. Sure, the game gets a lot of updates/features but when those aren't tied to expansions you're not selling yourself. At least with a expansion you can have a page with a list of features/content it will provide. How is Anet supposed to do this with LW and not have it be a giant mess? Anet has a hard on for wanting to avoid anything mainstream and its killing the game.
---
Oh, but it's not only raiders, they've only joined for real this time.
---
I'm pretty sure 90% of the players don't care because they don't even know them, they afk spam 1 while watching a serie on netflix and enjoy the game like this.  
---
That's why I don't even know why Anet is trying to give us elite spec with more options when players don't use them.
---
&gt; If it's not fun anymore, it's perfectly fine for people to leave.
---
That's why I left WoW. I wasn't a "hardcore" there, the classes I played just weren't fun anymore. If someone really isn't having fun with the game then taking a break, even if it's an extended one, is the best thing to do because all that happens is you start hating the game itself. 
---
At least with GW2 if you enjoy your character then you can take an extended break and not come back to something totally different. Unless you're a Chrono, then IDK just learn to like change.
---
No one has been writing it off. Sounds more like you just don't know who to follow/where to find it. And to whomever was writing it off giving you that impression, maybe inform them and don't listen to them because they're probably also the type of people who think chrono druid isn't dead Kappa
---
He's an obvious (and pretty bad) troll, just check the post history and comment karma. Don't feed them, they don't have much else going on
---
To answer your question, the game is definitely a lot less popular now than a year ago by just looking at active subreddit numbers. It seems that my server (Tarnished Coast) is dead for most of the day in WvW nowadays, even though we're a "full" server.
---
Vocal minority, as usual in between LS episodes/updates. Same as since launch. Just try your best to ignore it.
---
No. Eternal Armory + Sword of Justice is better.
---
&gt; I haven't seen a single person on my friendlist or my 4 guilds enter a PoF map since the first week of the expansion
---
No offense but your friends are stupid. Sure, there weren't many reasons to go there but once they did the PoF reward revamp its easily on par or better than HoT metas now.
---
Honestly the post OP links is pretty disingenuous for that reason, claiming the expectation of 6 raid wings a year because of an early guess made by a member of staff four years ago before the first raid even launched, as if that were a solid official declaration and as if you couldn't have guessed by now that it was too hopeful on Anet's part. Guy even linked the video as if it helps his case, but you have to be well aboard the hate wagon for optimism to be a point of condemnation.
---
Lol. I got the intent of your post. You seem to have aroused all of the crazies!  No good deed goes unpunished.
---
I would argue that the 'falling behind' applies to gear progression. You get exotics or even ascended on your main and you're happy to do the Living Story maps and story without fearing you don't have enough stats. You won't fall behind since ascended is best in slot as stats.
---
But personally I don't see HOW you can fall behind "2 hours of content" every 3 months.
---
Mantra is better than purging because now firebrand has many more meaningful skills that the need to fit into rotation and mantra of flame contrary to purging flames does not have a cast time.
---
Those 1-2% are the most active players, the one that make content in this game.
---
&gt; FFXIV is a raid/hardcore endgame player's utopia
---
What? Sure that's true for hardcore people, but the vast majority of FFXIV's playerbase never attempts EX content at all.
---
Considering how long it takes to gather 2500 fractal relics doing daily T4, it is for sure a lot.
---
good
---
No, the game isn't dying. 
---
However, it's definitely going through a rough period. 
---
No, it's not only about some hardcore raiders. WvW and PvP players have been neglected for years as well. Hell, even casual pve players are getting tired of repeating the same formulae on every lw release. People were craving for another expansion yet we're going straight to s5. 
---
Meanwhile, other games are getting successful and meaningful content, so some people are leaving for them. Most will come back for the next releases, but unless they're incredible good, the game will continue to be in this rough spot for quite some time.
---
Ever heard of unholy sanctuary? https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Unholy_Sanctuary
---
2+ years since last update to fractal shop.. No shinies to fight for.. Skritt angry.
---
Yeah, like I notice when people I don't play with quit the game. Some players' egos would love this meme to be accurate, but in reality moving on to a new game is a constant process and the world just keeps turning. An MMO needs to be able to survive churn, rather than try to hold on to players.
---
&gt; Pvp, wvw
---
There is literally nothing new here ... both in terms of how ANet has been treating those and the content for those modes. To suggest that the lack of content for those is anything is simply a lie. 
---
If those things can be used to demonstrate the game dying then we are way pass dead and well into undead status. It's all a dream ... Zhaitan never died.
---
I don't know why Guild Wars 2 is the only game people say "just go play something else" or "it's designed to take a break from". What kind of developer has their goal be for people to *not* play their game?
---
When I'm on my GW2 breaks I go play GW1, because even though it hasn't had a content update in seven years it still offers immense replayability. If a game promotes taking a break to play other things it doesn't mean developers are encouraging you to broaden your horizons and spend your money elsewhere, it means there isn't enough to do.
---
Ever heard of MightyTeapot? Only the biggest gw2 streamer going to quit the game in a month, and many of his friends/gildies are following
---
i dont thnk we have one for gw2 which unfortunate. I know in other games like Aion, you can view your toons from a browser.
---
I've mostly transitioned to Path of Exile at this point.  I picked up some stash tabs and have created something like 5-6 different characters this league; 2x ED Contagion, 2x Cyclone, Elemental Hit, considering Summon Raging Spirits, Divine Ire, Lacerate Gladiator; there's so much more build diversity when archetypes aren't the limiting factor for skill usage.  The gameplay is a blast and the only thing that really makes me miss GW2 is cosmetics that aren't defined by exclusively by expensive micro-transactions. 
---
I've had friends that have been playing Final Fantasy XIV for months.  I'm still working on a follow up post to my original complaint/observation post.  I almost posted it today, but the latest episode of TeaTime with Naru, Helseth and Vallun gave me some additional perspectives to consider, and I decided I want to reflect on category observations in addition to bullet points.  
---
GW2 is designed as a game that likely will not ever really struggle with population issues.  That's the nature of mega-servers for the most part.  However, something worth considering is the fact that ArenaNet, for whatever reason, can't seem to put out content at a modern schedule cadence.  The game *is* based on a heavily modified GW1 engine, and whether they're running into technical limitations when it comes to working with the UI, creating maps, armor-sets or continuing creation of a new IP -- something that I suspect they really haven't given up on -- whether it's a new MMO, or what... the reality is they can't stay competitive. 
---
Most alternative games on the market have solid identities.  The truth is GW2 is spreads itself way too thin trying to be a "Jack of all Trades," (Master of None) MMO and the only reason why it works so well is because of the game's extreme polish.  GW2 has a lot of quality of life features, and a unique combat aRPG based combat system, but is likely hamstrung by technical limitations that make content creation unsustainable difficult and inconsistent.  It's a game that rewards being a PvX player far more than being a PvP player or a PvE player and they can't seem to keep pace with community expectations anymore.  
---
I've lost hope for GW2.  It's not "dying," by any means, but open world meta-events, farms and story content is relatively niche.  It's content that people can enjoy, but it *is* a meme at this point; returning for 1-2 weeks every 3-4 months compounded by a communication policy that's well, frankly, is absolute ass.  I feel like instead of a communication policy ArenaNet has an electric fense and we've all been desensitized via shock collars because we don't expect them to communication with the community. 
---
[Then you have moments like this in Final Fantasy XIV](https://twitter.com/KZXcellent/status/1139918359296905216) where it's clear that FF XIV has devs that relate to the community and are still willing to interact with it *despite* a **language barrier,**and when you get to that point, let's be real, Japanese &lt;=&gt; English, what the *fuck* is your excuse ArenaNet? I can even find reasons to stay excited about[ League of Legends because of streamer oriented content, \(eg; Scarra\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIHgpezhxjg) or Team Fight Tactics -- a League of Legends auto-battler ...

ah, when i read your  post, I read 4G
---
Makes sense. I can't see those in the screenshot though :P
---
I mean sure if you login 1 hour a day and afk world bosses or autopilot map events then yeah, you won't care.
---
If you do any meaningful content like raids, PvP or the like then these things do indirectly effect you because you'll lose access to guides and stuff.
---
That's ok, keep turning a blind eye to the widespread problems plaguing GW2 while they continue to sink their beloved game into the ground from their ivory towers. Such an awesome community.

&gt; "hardcore" players: *constantly whine and beg for the game to be made easier*
---
??
---
&gt; People who love this game will continue to play and people who don't love it as much will leave
---
It's so funny because people who are currently leaving are probably people who love this game the most.
---
Who exactly are these “hardcore” players? How do you define them exactly?
---
The beauty of Guild Wars 2 is that there are so many different ways to play it. You can dedicate yourself to WvW, PvP, metas, fashion wars, or just pop back for the story whenever something new comes along. Maybe you just play for the events — fine!
---
Why do those who participate in raids always have to act so darn elitist — that you matter so much more than any other type of player. Why? Raiding is just one tiny part of Guild Wars 2.
---
If raiding and the endless quest for tiny little stat upgrades is what drives you, great! Enjoy that part of the game. If you’re expecting the developers of Guild Wars 2 to suddenly care more about that one tiny element of the game and just cater to you, you’re probably going to wait forever.
---
So fine, move  on and play something else. I certainly don’t care — you don’t bring anything to the part Guild Wars 2 I love. You just moan endlessly. I hope you find what you’re looking for in FFXIV.
---
Do you like to farm open world content for hours on end by pressing 1 or running in circles? If yes, the game is very much alive
---
Do you like to log in once every 2 weeks to buy new shinies in the gemstore?  If yes, the game is very much alive
---
Do you like to log in for a week every 4-5 months to do new Living Story content?  If yes, the game is very much alive
---
Do you like to do endgame content like Fractals, Raids, PvP or WvW?  If yes, the game is dying, dead or at best stagnant
---
Yeah this isn't a sub game with tons of expansions. Anet are relying heavily on the gem store.
---
If there is nobody playing to buy stuff from it, it won't end well.
---
Nice, and it just took them one year and a half to do that!  
---
Had they act at least in half a year like HoT, there would be less damage.
---
If you think WvW and sPvP are doing fine you are sadly mistaken. They've been neglected harder than raids.
---
You've strung a whole lot of sentences together here and made quite a few assumptions but have failed to make a coherent point or answer the question in any manner.

---
Been playing GW2 before it was launched, and FFXIV since ARR release - in no way a hardcore raider for either game. The things I _really_ enjoy from FFXIV are the story, the fight choreography, the world building, the spectacle, being able to pull from the rich history of other Final Fantasy games, and just how fun the classes are to play in any situation I find myself in. The developers have over, and over, and over displayed just how much they care about the game they're making and continuing to grow.
---
The latest expansion was so moving, so incredible, and the implications it has for the future of the game are astounding. I really wish Wooden Potatoes would play FFXIV, if just so he could geek out over the lore aspect of the game.
---
Don't worry, their Quality Of Life is the industry standard right now.
---
I mean if you had nothing to say you could have said nothing.
---
&gt;Go away.
---
Maybe don't post on a public forum if you can't handle people disagreeing with you petal.
---
really? if there was then that would explain her absence, I suppose
---
they always whine about not being able to play the classes they want, but anyone with a moderate amount of skill doesn't have that problem even with all the random nerfs coming from PvP.
---
That's the same thing as the wardrobe, isn't it?  Just with more variations to choose from.
---
That's after development stops, like GW1 or Diablo II.
---
While the game is in development, the paying customers are the ones keeping it going.
---
Nice question to ask in a forum where 95% of it IS the vocal minority and the rest a bunch of trolls.
---
I met a newbie yesterday in dr, i spent a good chunk of time showing him around. If you maybe have a spare I'd like to surprise him and give him the key
---
You tend to retain players who don’t feel like they’ll lose all their progress if they take a break. Basically if I take a break from a game like WoW or FFXIV, I’m coming back to outdated gear that’s pretty much worthless, I’ve lost everything I friended countless hours of he same monotonous endgame content for and have to start that process all over (end game is never fun IMO, the fun part of MMOs is the journey to endgame content. That’s why they call it the “endgame.” It’s for people who’ve already completed the game and want more to do. Very few MMOs do this in a way that doesn’t crush your soul. I personally believe end game and levelcap boosts destroy MMOs.)
---
With GW2, I can take a week, or a month, or several years off, and my legendaries will still be legendary items with top stats, that players still strive to obtain. My gear is still viable for whatever the current content is.
---
Deroir once taught how to farm fractal relics. Even with a really fast run, the amount earned isn't that high and you need to redo it a looot for a decent amount.
---
And everybody nows that pugging in fractals can be a russian roulette, specially at low level tiers.
---
I really wish they added a decent way to get fractal relics, but right now, I wouldn't suggest a new player using the relics for asc armor because one day they may regret it as I do!
---
The economy gets a refresh in every new "trade League" and people can cycle back or around to other games when they're satisfied with their X/(36)40 challenge progression.  I'm at 24/40 this season and it's the first league (Legion) where I've actually beaten both the Elder and Shaper as well as collected 10/15 memory fragments for Zana's Questline / (Uber Elder).  Path of Exile is *obscenely* good at recycling content and adapting features from previous "Leagues" (season mechanics) into future updates.
---
The casual ones just leave. We don't hear about it.
---
It would also work with 
---
"I'm really quitting this time. HEY COMMUNITY I AM QUITTING" 
---
Community: silence
---
Shocked face.
---
There has been no outcry. The only people worried about PvE raiders leaving the game are other PvE raiders. The vast, vast majority don't give a shit.
---
Come play FF14 with me, Noodle
---
The silence is the most concerning thing.
---
Nobody has anything to be hyped about. We don't even know where we're going next, what's getting added... we've seen astoundingly little in the way of raids and fractals... astoundingly little of any new lore, too, come to think of it... 
---
What's there to look forward to? There's nothing that I know besides vague promises that may never even come for all I know, and the cynic within me thinks that Anet is making a colossal mistake not having done an expansion after S4 - that it will end up effectively killing the name because right now, I think the game needs the kind of news and allure an expansion brings. Not a living story with increasingly long gaps between episodes. 
---
All I'm really doing is some weekly raids, and right now a large part of that is because I'm close to Envoy's Herald. What will I do when that goal is achieved...?
---
I use wooden potatoes as ASMR
---
at least you get a sigil of force with imryldyeen
---
I've literally logged in simply to do ascended crafting and sell the mats..... no clue why I need the gold if I don't really play... lol
---
Literally false. I'm neither surprised they were told this, nor am surprised they left. As many others, who've likely never played with or spoken to those people.
---
It is so strange.
---
I do not think another LS season will draw many people in, maybe retain some players. An expansion is needed right now, but it's unlikely to come. 
---
Most frustrating part is that this happened before with LS1 and LS2 and then finally HoT. They *should* have learned that lesson, but they haven't.
---
GW2 to me has always been a fun yet flawed sequel to GW1.  
---
GW2’s biggest strength has always been the art direction and combat.  I really like being restricted to a single skill bar.  It’s a good system that other MMO’s should use.  It’s refreshing to play a game and not have your screen filled with skill bars (that are occupied by duplicate skills).  
---
GW2’s biggest weakness is that it never lived up to its full potential.  During the “Colin era” of GW2, the developers cut too many corners building the foundations of GW2.  Those flawed foundations are causing problems today.  
---
If GW2 is to survive long term, they’ll need to revamp the core mechanics (e.g. the crafting system, weapon skills etc.) and relaunch the game with a brand new story unrelated to the Elder Dragons.
---
Every living story update brings people back then they drop off after theyre done untill the next. People screaming games dead is nothing new just ignore it and move on. A lot of it is also because people well known from the speed running guilds and such say theyre done and everyone else just loses a few cells
---
Tl;dr If you enjoy the game play the damn game
---
Like what?
---
this is unironically how the ff14 director said about his game though. he knows the team can never make enough content for people who sub 365 days, so he said if theres nothing new, just unsub and resub later on

---
&gt; Why is Guild Wars 2 is the only game where people consistently say "just go play something else" or "it's designed to take a break from".
---
Maybe because it has an older audience who already acquired a more realistic view on both life and games, and can appreciate certain aspects of that design philosophy.
---
&gt; What kind of developer has their goal be for people to not play their game?
---
Because taking breaks from anything is good and healthy. Building addiction disguised as "retention", on the other hand, is not.
---
Truth to be told they have a hundred wow refuge posts and a single gw2 one.
---
And they just got a expansion of all things.
---
I'm relatively sure Anet is better at this business than we are. I know there are a lot of smart people at there, but there have been a lot of launches of a lot of games that Anet has lived through. Anet likely doesn't think they can compete against a major release like FF XIV, which is available on both console and computers, so the smartest thing they can do is let people go there. This happens when WoW expansions come out too, sometimes. There's not reason to suspect that people won't go there and then some people will be dissatisfied and won't come back when Anet hits the news/next update that is big. Because no matter what Anet does now, they're not going to stop people from trying that product. 
---
Face it, Bless Online was an unmitigated disaster on their western launch day, not 6.5 years after they launched.  Anet didn't break the game. They simply ended a season that was pretty well received.   only a month ago, there were plenty of positive posts in this forum. People forget to easily. 
---
Anet is actually smarter not to try to go head to head with a company that has more money for advertising. Because that level of hype never lasts.
---
Do you have any idea how many WoW refugees came here from the last expansion. 
---
Every game when it launches has interest. It gets some hype. people come back. Anet is not trying to compete with that, because they don't have enough to compete with it. But if you don't think there's a longer game here, I'm not sure what to tell you.
---
This happens during a lot of big launches with Anet, it always has. Anet just lets the big launch go, people cry doom and gloom, some people like the game some people don't, and Anet captures the ones who come back.
---
People don't think Anet is working on an expansion, but I believe they are. They're just not ready to talk about it when it's far enough off. In the mean time, they want to time that announcement and that expansion with what's going on in the market for maximum effect. It's a strategy. 
---
This industry isn't decided in a day or two, and this isn't Bless with a new launch. Did you see the WoW forums when the last expansion came out. And people said the same stuff about WoW.  
---
So now, a year or so later, they're announcing classic. It's not over.  Don't let the tide bother you. It goes in it comes out.
---
Well gosh, it's almost as if getting angrier and angrier at something doesn't always get you what you want. Who knew!
---
obviously a company should not only focus on hardcore/endgame/etc players, but it is in ANet's best interest to at least attempt to keep that demographic interested. they might not be the big whales companies are so thirsty for, but they are the one popularizing the game and it's content, on top of creating and providing several services to the more general community. who do you think comes up with endgame builds and actually runs the number, or makes tutorials about those builds and the encounters they are used on? certainly not your average longbow 4 OW ranger.
---
and considering that anet's marketing budget is particularly limited in general, they will suffer even more from losing such a productive layer of the game's population.
---
but even if you disregard all of that, there is simply no denying that ANet has been strongly neglecting *at least* sPvP and WvW over the last couple of years, and that is something that influences even the most casual players in those modes, regardless of whether the top players leave or not.
---
&gt; Tl;dr If you enjoy the game play the damn game
---
Finally someone with some sense to them.
---
&gt; the most active players,
---
*These* are the ones grinding Silverwastes and bosses and metas for hours each day together with hundreds of other people?
---
&gt;those rare gem cards are ur only option now
---
You can literally buy hundreds of gemcards on ebay if you so wish. Not saying that's 100% safe, but rare they are not.
---
That's a completely fair question. I'm wondering the same. The only point I was trying to make was that season 5 *exists*.
---
A bunch of angry hardcore players will upvote this while the "community" is out living their lives...
---
big true
---
amen
---
Thats why i quit wow ...again few weeks ago,after 14 y cant stand it,tried gw2 when it got out but wow won ,at the time...now im swamped with content in gw2
---
even in their 1h panel about their game design they said part of the design is about ppl stopping playing the game until there's new league and how they tweaked the size/pacing of new releases with trial and error to make it optimal for active player numbers
---
I would also just like to make a note. Not directed at op to be rude or anything. More so at the people who constantly claim dead game just because 1 big player stopped because they got burnt out doing the same shit over and over
---
I'm confident the servers won't close down no matter what happens, but less people playing means less revenue for the company, which means less content for a game I love. I don't see how it isn't a dire situation then when people leave in droves.
---
GW1 is still operating, but it's not "alive".
---
FF for PVE , gw2 for pvp/wvw. I've been like that for almost 2 years
---
Then you haven't read much in the forums. The tonus there has been "leave you disgusting hardcore shitters" for years now.
---
Literally, the casuals who are mostly complaining about hardcore players being so toxic, have been screaming at them for years. 
---
I don't wanna say hardcores aren't toxic, but man, the casuals tend to flame way more vigorously.
---
Hardcore players matter too.
---
&gt;what's this with people acting like GW2 didn't just get a LS a raid, massive collections, and a revamped story, though
---
Does it not concern you people are *already* acting like that, though? 
---
&gt;"the future of GW2 is uncertain" even though Anet announced LS5 a LONG time ago. I thought that counted but apparently not?
---
We know LS5 is coming. We don't know when, or what it's about, or what it adds, or anything about it other than it's supposed to exist. And now that LS4 has ended and we're almost a year since that announcement, that's... kind of concerning. Nobody knows what the future holds for GW2 at all. Cynicism, apathy and resentment has built up significantly within several of GW2's communities due to lack of acknowledgement, updates, and most importantly, content. So many other games have had recent updates, or shown what's upcoming. Can you blame them for saying they're going to leave? 
---
Cynicism within this community as a general thing isn't a new thing, but I have never really seen it be this bad from so many different people. Even myself. And I try to be positive. But I can't be. I can pretend things are fine, if I want to.
---
But they're not.
---
Nah man we get our sick boss rush event to sooth some ultra casuals.
---
Ultimately, GW2 is an amazing game that tries to be too many things at once but doesn't commit to anything enough to call itself that.
---
To me anyone who has the time to play an MMO is hardcore lol
---
If they release 2-4 hours of content every 6 months (living world) then that's... 12 hours of content a year, to be generous.
---
A "hardcore" person doing their weekly clear is still putting in 30 minutes, every week, and then going external to network with others and engage in the product externally. That's still 26 hours of gameplay in a year. Also it's likely the hardcore person is also gobbling up the same content the average player is doing, and so I'd add those 12 hours as well. That's 38 hours, not bad. 
---
I feel like this just reinforced my point.
---
Its almost like wow caters to the hardcore players.
---
As someone who's played both, ff14's got a much better /actual/ formula for 'play a month or two, leave for a few months, come back, repeat' cadence. Too much of GW2's dev time is spent on adding new /cash shop/ cosmetics, which aren't an enjoyable goal to work towards because actually making enough money to get significant amounts of gems is unpleasant and frustrating for the majority of players who are not market barons. Not to mention the actual methods of getting significant sums of gold is mostly stale.
---
GW2 to me is like an example of the folly of relying entirely on cash shop cosmetics to pay for new content - in the end, more and more dev time is directed to making new cash shop things and less and less towards actual things you can unlock via gameplay.
---
Jebus, and I was pissed at myself for averaging 2 hours a day over the last 6 years.
---
Better to seemingly underestimate the "power of the community" than overestimate.
---
How can this game be hardcore, it has no power progression.
---
&gt; Aside from expansions, which can't be bought with Gems, they do not invest a lot of money into the game.  
---
funny, i know several hardcore players with a lot more then just 5 accounts and a shitton of gemstore stuff because they simply drop a few bucks each month into the shop.
---
Then why disagree at all? Solving an issue like this, if it even has a solution, won't come by pretending it doesn't exist. Failure to acknowledge issues does not mean they do not exist.
---
...why is your immediate assumption that hardcore players don’t spend money?  In my experience the crazier you are about a game the more you are willing to spend additional money.
---
It’s honestly kind of common sense that the hardcore base drives most games.  They create the content, the builds, and metas.  Almost every game dies pretty quickly as soon as it’s abandoned by the hardcore base.
---
lol.
---
Ben P refuses to do a new game mode I PvP citing “it would split the community”. For a company that is always trying to challenge status quo, pvp has to be the most vanilla BS ever.
---
Literally.
---
I don't expect much from LS5, and I'm not really expecting an Xpac 3 at this point. 
---
The end of LS4 seemed pretty _"Series FINale"_ to me and really, if they did make an XPac 3 based on Cantha I'd skip it and be really done. I'm sick of re-treading the same ground I saw _12 years ago_ in GW1. If they make Guild Wars 3, I'll also skip it cause I know what to expect after 12 years. 
---
If they can't actually shake it up and do something _new_, that's what's really going to kill them. 
---
That and most all the content can be done near solo. Including WvW, and many fractals, if you really try. I can get better single player games and stories _in my single player games._
---
I liked the short window but it did feel like if you didn't play daily, you missed a lot.  It doesn't help that LS1 never returned.
---
I think they are readying it for maintenance mode to move on to GW3.
---
It isn't the hardcore players we want to leave. Hardcore players are awesome! It is the toxic players we don't want. If a large percentage of those happen to be hardcore players, oh well.
---
I don't think I can blame anyone for feeling apathetic and dejected about the state of this game. I doubt it will be as large as they want it to be given Anet's history of overpromising and then underdelivering. And much of that was when GW2 was a newer game. And so many things have taken so long to be added. Many still aren't.

Ahahahahaha you madman, spot on comment
---
Yup the game pulls in the same amount after xpacs every time. That number is worth less as inflation increases. Mismanagement of the company and lack of community outreach leads to layoffs.
---
Next time come with something other that “Wrong. yeah I whinnnnnn”
---
Currently: A dead game walking.
---
&gt; Don't get hit.  
---
Can you even get hit anyway? :')
---
&gt;None of this is "content" that's meant to be replayable
---
It seems like Anet realized around Bloodstone Fen -&gt; Ember Bay -&gt; Iced Berry Land that pumping maps out constantly made players happy at the time, and has stuck to that ever since without re-examining it. At that time we were in a point with GW2 where a lot of time had been poured into TLC on existing systems/areas, so new content so rapidly was something different and welcomed. But you can't press that agenda forever as an MMO dev. MMO content is made to be replayed, grinded out, and to "stick", something that is persistent to the world. But since every team in Anet is focused on pressing forward, we haven't seen that serious look back from the company, with patches that sharpen up that past content and draw into relevance pieces which fell out of favor. Adding a bonus lootbox to map boss farms is the closest we've seen to some TLC on older content for a while and...I don't really \*care\* about an extra box of 1% chance of worthwhile loot.

What GW2 Vanilla did which really drew me in, was it valued player interaction as the primary objective. People doing stuff with and around each other. Which the field combo system did an excellent job of making combat more open to strangers doing content around/with other strangers. Raids weren't a thing because gear grind for power wasn't the point. People were the point. And the original design of dungeons (before stack meta nuked it) was really in that vein too. Where people were trying to piece together different skills to create solutions to problems presented outside of stat concerns. Changing each dungeon as you found people with different classes trying to mesh together.
---
These days PvE to me feels...more like a gear grind game. You roller coaster through whatever map is newest until you get the new (fashion) gear from it before people stop bothering with it, then you afk until the next patch with a map. Doing any vanilla or past content being largely irrelevant to go back to unless you're farming World Completion for gold or legendaries. So I've largely the past year or two just stuck to WvW, entering PvE in bursts every couple patches to do the new content, ignore the fashion for farming it, and then calling it a day. None of the maps have felt engaging enough to be something I \*want\* to explore endlessly or spend large amounts of time in. None have felt truly polished, or interesting to do with random assortments of strangers in the same way that defending a farm from Bandits, and then going on the offensive and attacking their Queensdale stronghold to hold the area at a temporary peace. I feel like in all of this rampant content and change, the game kind of...forgot what it was once good at.  
---
To me as a Veteran, the game has a lot of QoL improvements and shiny things which have been added with time which are neat and all, but the core game is just not as directly \*good\* as it used to be. I miss the kinetic nature of vanilla combat, and the depth that was brought out of making the most out of a simplified bar with skills which weren't innately over the top or fancy, but when brought together with other skills could be incredible. I miss the world of pre-resistance and chronomancer, of hammers and blasting water fields. And I don't think we'll ever really see anything that outright engaging again from the game.
---
I'll raise my hand as a guy who probably is deserved to be told "bro just play something else", but as somebody who likes the format of WvW, the competition isn't out yet, so we have a wait ahead of us on that front I guess.

&gt; Solving an issue like this,
---
The current issue:
---
* ArenaNet spreading itself too thin with Raids, PvP and WvW instead of pouring all of their efforts into high amounts of frequently released, highly accessible, highly replayable PvE.
---
The counter-issue:
---
* All the other token fringe audiences vocally pushing their content desires on the social media as if GW2 was targeted specifically at them.
---
Yup exactly. Even if they did a dramatic shift away from the normal guild wars 2 it would still provide a new way to play. Bringing life to the game. Something missing the last 2 years.
---
Agree with the maintenance, combat, qol. But you got it wrong with the alt unfriendliness. Ffxiv is even waaay more alt friendly with being able to switch jobs on the fly. Unless i misunderstood?
---
True GW2 endgame is played on reddit after quitting the game you invested thousands of hours in.
---
Pure delusion. Most hardcore players I know have almost every class geared and play what they want.
---
I think the problem is that the loudest complainers want the game to be something it purposefully isn't and that most people don't want it to be.
---
Like, it's one thing to complain because you hated the story for the last LS or feel like there's no incentive to explore old maps that you kinda miss. These are things that Anet could fix that wouldn't really change what Gw2 is, and improve on what it is. 
---
But a lot of complaints I see are "I need more legendaries to craft"/"Game is too easy"/"Need more focus on PvP"/etc--stuff that it's clear Anet doesn't do on purpose because the majority of its base is people who don't play every day, who invest some time in the game, maybe come back in a few weeks, and spend money to catch up when necessary, and who don't care about competitive play or have every legendary in the game yet. If someone's complaining that the game isn't hard enough, then yeah, they need to get creative, take a break from the game, or find a new one, because this game just isn't going to leave casual players behind to cater to the top 10% who have played so much they can do all the content in their sleep.
---
They really need to say their development plans. Right now I don't know if they're doing anything but festivals and living story
---
Don't worry, lishtenbird is almost as bad as lordkrall, you won't get through to them with logic.
---
Yeah and the so called hardcore players are very loudly announcing that they are. Kinda funny to be honest.
---
And they're all leaving, and with them a lot of other players. Fractal players leave because of no more CMs and the newer fractals being really "meh" to "omfg fuck siren's", Raiders leave because of lack of content, way too easy raids for hardcore people, too difficult ones for noobs to get into. PvP scene died years and the last few people are also leaving because of the lack of balacing and it being simply unfun, WvW players are most likely to stay since their mode is just meh and just gets ignored but they're still somehow there + balancing issues and Dungeon players.... welp, the 50 left there are just merging pathes and are exploiting the shit out of everything. The only people happy are casuals who can only play like 4hours at a weekend and who just care about fashion, story, exploring and festivals, which is fine but everybody who spends more time in this game will run out of fun things to do.... I really wish it wouldn't be that way.
---
And ofc, he has a say in creating a new pvp game mode...
---
Love this concept. Sad it's not implemented.
