It's not validation issues actually, if you read my other comment clearly about the fact that what drew me into this game was the ability to play non-human characters. Or maybe that I was commending Anet's ability to expand on the character creator.
---
---
---
Only ever go far to neutralize it when you have both other bases, they wont be guarding as heavily because they're behind so they're at mid and home, neuting it cause them to take pressure off your guys at home and mid and you demoralize them by falling even further behind
---
I mean, seeing more people complaining about people who complain about diversity than the people who complain about diversity in the first place is just proof of how good the community is, right?
---
I mean, I guess not for the people who hate diversity, but its not like they're not much of a loss.
---
Don't be sorry for something you're not sorry for. It is what it is.
---
I'd love to have more Canthan-themed options for humans one day like what they did for Elonians.

Not enough stripper but I did find something revealing enough for my tastes and it's also a [Necro!](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/501126217135816753/560970441586376704/gw900.jpg)

You make it sound as if there's a gameplay difference between spaghettic noodle arms and super beef gun cannon arms. A tiny little Asura hits as hard as a huge Norn. A skinny human hits as hard as a fat human.
---
I like the armor/weapon unlocks on the last tab.
---
&gt; You make it sound as if there's a gameplay difference between spaghetti noodle arms and super beef gun cannon arms.
---

---
The point that I'm trying to make is "if you're likely to change your current body's amount of fat and muscles anyway, why stop there and not change everything else, instead of recreating only some parts that you find 'good' while correcting the ones that are 'bad'". I find that psychologically intriguing, because yes, as you've said, it makes absolutely no gameplay difference anyway.
---
I've got a shortbow like that myself.  I'm not sure if that's the number it has though.  It used to be a norn cultural short bow, I think, that was on my charr thief.
---
Oh, I like that - good call!
---
I use crafting in some way pretty much every day. May it be refining something, crafting some thing that i need for the collection, finding a skin i wanted that i can craft, did that today actaully when i realised i was missing a shield skin i wanted, and also to craft the items needed for stats swap and food for wvw, stones for wvw, food for fractals. Collection items such as the bat and the snowy shoulders well i can go on and on and on...
---
Yes i can buy some of it from the trading post for more gold, or i can use the storage i have and craft it my self when ever i want. I can also use it to sell items i craft. 
---
Is it a must? Well depends really. If you want to finnish collections, easier to craft legendaries, ascended gear or weapons or the like then yest crafting is ok in GW2. If you normally hate crafting regardless then you can get away a lot by buying on trading post or ask others to craft for you, until you reach the accountbound wall.
---
I mean, you can make a post expecting an argument to happen without wanting an argument to happen.
---
Really? Because you can craft and sell on the trading post and just with the latest story chapter you got the crystal skin weapons, before that there was the armor and so on. That is not content for crafting?
---
we wuz kangz, mostly, as evident by the link provided by OP.
---
dgh still has cc on signet, gs5 and f1. its not controversial, it's just the situations you talk about aren't supporting that claim. i agree that reaper can be better to run but only when your pugs are really helpless and you're for the most part carrying which is kinda like soloing, which is what reaper is better at than dgh.
---
So in one of the subreddits there was a question about why Bless ended up being such a good advertisement for GW2 when people were leaving bless. There were several paragraphs explains but it boiled down to the community. There were members helping out the refugees in the starting zone and everyone was super helpful. This helps bring and keep people in the game.
---
I know I am super late but I was finally working on my gryphon. I got in a group for bounties in the crystal oasis and asked about the legendary facet. The leader said they had done it but would check and do it when we moved by for other bounties. This was good. Another player chimed up and said “gold to the tag would help.” That was a buzz kill because I had specialization collection to complete and the gryphon to buy (I finished both and I have 18 gold). Thankfully the tag went and organized it for the map before they logged (and for free). This helped restored my faith in the community.
---
Remember 20g or an achievement might not b3 much to you but it could mean the world to someone else. If you give 5 minutes of your time to explain or help someone, you could be creating a lifelong member of the community.
---
I will say from experience every PoF point is soloable but HoT is very not

---
Yeah I can open the game and my account seems fine but every time I open the game I'm going to get that email sent to me.
---
Thanks for the info about that being a problem. Maybe its the same issue I have.
---
You can keep believing what you believe, and I will keep believing in what you believe.
---
What I see and keep seeing is this: The comm calls on the players, they converge there. Many trashclasses and we fail at beating a well-organized blob with bombs and bubbles several times. Comm looks at the behavior of the players, all fanned out, not really listening.
---
Then, slowly things change, not in overall class composition. For the most part we lack bubbles. We don't use a single portalbomb. But we stack properly. We push properly. Discipline. Behavior. I see this again and again. Behavior and the right tactic. It doesn't win you every fight, but it wins you enough fights. And it IS tactical. It's not "everyone does what they want". And this wins us fights.
---
YMMV - which it obviously does, but "works for me" is really good enough for me.
---
When I fight a giant, world ending dragon I want to look like it woke me from my sleep. That is, I want to having nothing but my Sword, Boxers, and slippers.
---
1. The game is designed in a way to fomenting people to keep going back to low levels areas, and it has a system to lower your stats so you are not going to be overpower there, so people keep coming to low levels maps to do events and farm things. In addition to that, there is a lot of people leveling new characters. 
---
2. Yes, there is a looking for group, but again, the game is designed to play with people just if you stay close, it automatically shares everything and you can do world events with people even without party, is pretty amazing and works fantastic.
---
3. I don't understand the "interactive part" but crafting is needed to build high level armor, crafting is not too mucho grindy, is easy to level up (comparing with another games) and you can have 2 profession active but you can level up all of them. Crafting is pretty well implemented, I have no experience making money with it but I do craft A LOT for me and I am not a "crafter" in MMO, mostly avoid it and still here I use it a lot. 
---
4. Mostly some items climb in prices because higher or lower drops in games in materials, when there is an event or an injection of some crafting material the prices drops or rise, some people play to flip the market but I don't, but there is people doing money in that way.
---
5. GW2 has a horizontal progression and the cap is really easy to achieve, so people keep doing a lot of low level stuff, doing a lot of things, is not like WOW where a new content comes and all the people get the new max level and everything else is desert and empty, you have here a pretty well balance population in every map, event, or mode. Some has more, some has less but there is people everywhere doing a lot of stuff regardless the level. 
---
6. Yes, I don't know them but there a big one I don't remember the name.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You can try the whole main game for free, and after you complete the main content (that is a LOT) you can decide if you want to purchase the expansions, expansion are more content but not more levels and stats, more content like more specializations, maps, events, modes or even things like gliding or mounts (mounts are BY FAR the best mount system in any MMO game). So, just download the core game, play, get fun, don't rush, just play, explore (the world is fantastic) and when you hit 80 you can decide if the game worth it for you. Give it a shot, is a fantastic game.

Would you mind telling me how to put addons onto GW2? I wanna try to add d912pxy

I thought at one point the same, that it was lower than most people think but that you need at least some.  But there were some threads where people did the "science/math" and calculated the actual dps needed and it shocked even me on how low it was.  Far lower than anything I had imagined.  Unfortunately, don't remember the numbers and don't have the thread bookmarked.  You might be able to find it if you search.  But as I recall, it was so low that unless everyone (or majority) are all playing pure healing/bunker builds, you got the DPS.  And compared to the DPS from SC, they aren't even in the same city less alone the same ballpark.
---
If the enemy doesn't less brains than half an ettin's head, they'll just ignore the bunker and go 3v2 one of the other two points.
---
The Desert for me. Those night skies are amazingly beautiful, plus the music, i just park my character somewhere safe and enjoy the sights and sounds.
---
The warrior song by sean householder according to my pixel.
---
Reaching max level can be done in a few days or weeks, every alt you do will reach it if you give a few hours here and there. 
---
Of course there are little tricks like changing maps to maximize experience, a quick google search will give you tips, but with or without tricks it should not take unending time, many players keep multiple max level characters.
---
When did lions arch add cars?
---
But HoT was Sylvari based more or less, Season 1 was focused on Scarlet, the main story is focused on everyone. Apart from PoF and S3 to an extent, the story uses all races. If they make a Charr expansion, you joining whatever legion they have will go against lore.
---
Specially [ginger](https://youtu.be/KVN_0qvuhhw)s.
---
It takes 4 seconds to decap, 13 to fully capture.
---
When you win the mid fight at the beginning of the match, the enemy team will be respawning, meaning, that far will get overrun by people if you try to cap it. Not only that, but the enemy might go mid and create an uneven fight mid, and or home and you would only be trading side nodes. If you die or get really low at far then you now are staggered, the enemy is grouped up due to respawning and will probably overrun mid, thus the game swings back int heir favor.
---
The best strategy is to decap far, and go back mid, and wait for them. They either have to go mid with only 4 people top (because one of them has to be at far for a whole 13 seconds) or they have to go far and then mid, which costs time and has mental toll on soloQ since it is harder to communicate this stuff, which is why you see the usual "wHy ARe tHEre 3 aT HoMe?!" comments.
---
You get 5 points on each kill, and you are getting double their ticks-per-second by 2 capping. Each subsequent kill nets you more points. If they try to rush your home, you can respond faster since you own mid; the center of the map and thus have map control, and it is also usually close to map objectives.
---
tl;dr the most logical strategy for winning mid fights and having home, is to defend 2 caps and kill as they come, ONLY decap far, unless you have a thief and/or you are completely cleaning floor with them.
---
Neutralizing takes 5 seconds, capturing a additional 15.  So if you just sneak in to decap a point, it takes you 5s to burn 15s of an opponent's time, giving you a sizable head start to force a lopsided fight.
---
You give up that tempo advantage if you full cap, burning another 15s in order to get points.  This is worthwhile if you will be defending the point and intend to hold it, but if you were just flipping it before rotating back to support your team it is a big waste of time.
---
1) You'll meet plenty along the way.
---
2) There's an LFG system with a bunch of tabs for different kinds of game content, regularly used to find raid and fractal groups, and occasionally dungeon groups but you might do better joining a guild to find dungeon parties since dungeons are very old content.
---
3) You need crafting for making legendaries, you can make ascended gear with crafting and you can use it to make best quality food buff items, among other things you can sell for a profit. If you want to spend all day mining, crafting and selling, you can do that and you'll probably make a fair chunk of gold on the trade post.
---
4) The economy revolves around the tradepost, which is essentially an auction house / open market type thing. There's only very limited player-to-player trading via the mail system.
---
5) At prime time hours, there's plenty running raids, but you might struggle to find a group if LFGing in the wee hours of the morning.
---
6) I've no idea.
---
7) There is no 7. Hope you have a good time with GW2, if there's anything you're not sure about just ask in map chat or join a guild to help you out. People are mostly pretty friendly and there are plenty of guilds looking for new members. Best of luck!
---
I've done TT twice. The last time, I got really annoyed by some trolls who went asked to keep chat clear for instructions, just decided to spam "AAAAA" many times. But, both times went pretty smooth in terms of how well they were organized and called.
---
[Doern Velázquez](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Doern_Velazquez) claims to be from Kryta, but he isn't.
---
He is likely from an never visited region. Not in Tyria, Elona or Cantha.
---
ANet loves to play the longest long games.
---
For open world, it really doesn't matter what weapons you use, but for fractals and *especially* raids, GS + S/A definitely beats out anything longbow. Plus Worldly Impact does the most damage with a GS equipped, due to two-handing training and honed axes.
---
They don't work like berries, they are account gated.

I wish more people realized that the best way to truly get and normalize diversity is the way mentioned by Morgan Freeman in [the popular excerpt of one of his interviews](https://youtu.be/Mh8mUia75k8).

Maybe they were driving a beetle.

You may have had good intentions but this is getting locked and removed before I have to start throwing out bans.

---
I'm currently playing fractals with a Reaper on my party. This guy has fractal omnipotion, ad infinitum, 150 AR, but not only he has a little less than 5k AP, but he also absolutely SUCKS at fractals. Not even his class, the basic mechanics of deepstone and swampland go completely over his head.  
---
How the hell does something like this happens?

Ironically, belts aren't visible. Although I understand why, it would probably mess with their chest/leg armour design too much.
---
True. Most teams just sent people over and wasted time there. So that bunker is actually doing his annoying job xd
---
One large image like the elder scrolls online poster would have been better. Should have considered more recent art too. This is launch stuff.
---
Ad much ad I'm happy they are marketing I still feel their approach is totally amature. Seems like a total waste of time and money.
---
^ upvote the shit out of this. Couldn't said it better myself. Lol
---
I've never seen so many people just standing around eating autoattacks and rapid fires
---
What Frog says. But also worth noting that the currency requirements in bloodstone is lower than in berries. And bloodstone trinkets can be stat-changed. So you can do your math
---
Because you presumably care about the game and want to keep it popular enough to keep getting new content, and for it to have a longer lifespan? I mean, you're totally within your rights to be selfish (it's your experience and money, after all), but you're just shooting yourself in the foot if you sit there being a grump about promoting a game that you enjoy.
---
You have nothing to lose, and everything to gain, by doing little things here and there to promote the game -- even if that thing is just telling a friend who mentioned being interested in picking up a new game.
---
Besides, nobody here said the players were "obliged" to do anything. They were just asking what we *could* do (presumably for those of us who want to). And the community doing things in no way stops or hinders the devs doing things, too. Why not both?
---
Lws3 is the easiest just farming winter berries. There are other options that require just gold but they aren’t worth it at all [check this guide for details](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character#Other_back_pieces)
---
Was about to say, a good thief can full cap far after mid fight dies down, assuming home team wins. Then they can peel enemies returning to mid from respawn, but should still never fight at far. It's much better to assist mid rather than try to solo far, usually (barring a decent matchup at far). This is where timing rotations becomes important.
---
Thief should *always* be looking at mid, and keeping an eye on health bars. That's how you determine where you need to be at any one time. I've found that the best times to full cap far are after a solid mid wipe, or a team fight at home. Both give you a good idea of the enemy's future movements, giving you the information you need to decide which node to rotate to next.
---
Alrighty! Back to the frontier for the 1000th times LOL
---
There are good number of Aussie based Guilds in NA as far as I know. If you are thinking about changing to NA, you might as well try the ping with a free account first. I'm not sure about any Aussie based Guilds in EU . I run a SEA timezone based guild on EU though.
---
I mean there are options with collections and other season 3 purchasable back items but bitterfrost is the fastest if you’re starting at 0
---
I still use Knight of the Thorn on my main as a way to remember Trahearne by.
---
For other characters, it depends. Combat Healer when I'm helping out in low zones, Deer Commander and Honorary Skritt when I'm dicking about, Been There Done That when leveling alts and wanting to signify that I'm not a new player.......other than the utility purposes, I tend to stay away from the cool-sounding ones and put on quirky ones, mostly.
---
Yeah I'll probably just do it since I have 5 chars that can farm that map. I may farm both Doric and Bitterfrost and use the latter for UM conversion. Farming gives me a headache lol hopefully this is the last thing I nerd to farm

I'm actually hoping that some big announcement would be made following episode 6. They'll be in LA for E3 which I will be attending so fingers crossed!
---
Compared to WoW's $60 not even max level boost GW2's is cheap.
---
the first two are hardest, so try landing as far away from them as you can. once you get past those, dodge INTO the next rock as soon as you land, then jump to the safe edge of the next platform. wait for evade to recharge, then dodge into each rock before you pass it.
---
Unless you're extremely comfortable &amp; confident I don't recommend you do sword weaver without support. Even with support you'll probably struggle for a while and possibly be more of a detriment than merit to the group. That said if you have a good healer they'll be able to take care of you in most cases. When I heal and see weavers in the party I pay extra attention to them generally.
---
For trash mobs you can start in earth and use Sandstorm (glyph of storms) for AOE blind and kill everything before it ends, or if you're in a comp with supports -- chrono can pull and grav well, or druid can immob and daze (I tend to do this on druid for my dps pugs, not sure about other druids). But I also agree with the other person who suggested Sc/Wh FA tempest. Apart from the stab and stunbreaks, you have way more range compared to sword weaver and faster access to water attunement and bonus overload as your "oh shit" button.
---
&gt;Is the solution just more damage, or should is there other tricks I should know?
---
You can run the trait in Arcane for the auto-triggering arcane shield, and also swap out one of your utilities for another arcane shield as a training wheel. Your goal should be to learn about positioning and dodging so that you will no longer need this skill. Also, if you're running tempest sometimes Aftershock is useful to bring along for reflects (We Bleed Fire, Arkk's balls) if your team lacks projectile mitigation for some reason.
---
Some pugs don't care about team comp. Some do. This should be reflected in each LFG description.
---
Anyway, the good news is once you learn to survive fractals as an ele, you're good for basically everything else.
---
There is a Brazilian no life that I always see in games even after taking a break that basically just screams at his team while bunkering... Dont be that guy

Honorary Skritt.  Because she's an honorary skritt.
---
I think most Aussies are on North America, since the unofficial Aussie server at launch was Sea of Sorrows.

I'm down in Tasmania, and I'm on a US server.  Seems there are some people on at our prime time, but again, it's more small groups than big zergs.

I made a male asura with a vowel at the end because I didn't know at the time. I've always been tempted to change his name, but I rarely touch the character and named him from an NPC in another game so I've always just held on to it.
---
Still not enough to make up the cost of the hummingbird but a nice drop nonetheless
---
Ya, I think I got the Duelist Pauldrons with my last Wardrobe Unlock. Made me go on a vendor spree, buying all the trash from Coin and Karma vendors I could so hopefully I'd never have that shit happen again.
---
no, the part that swaps is your traits, utility skills, and stats, but everything you have equipped stays the same
---
make a trailer for build templates when they come out
---
I bought 5 keys hoping to get a greatsword skin but had the hummingbird instead. 🤷‍♀️
---
Yeah, but I'm fine with 300g instead of 700. 
---
Actually only 250g, while doing map completion I got a Sunscythe (60g) too. :P
---
A good focus pull that slaps all the enemies into a nice pile to be destroyed is oh so satisfying.

Sweet, sweet treasure!

I love map chat.
---
I'm glad I'm in the minority (?) who is very indifferent about the Hummingbird. I mean, it's pretty, but I feel it denature the skimmer too much and it loses its aquatic touch. My [Oceanic Ray](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Oceanic_Ray) is still my bae.

And I suppose my wallet is glad of that lol.
---
what is the poor mans bountiful maintenance oil? i dont quite have the gold to level and craft bountiful maintenance oil and was wondering if there is a cheaper alternative that i can get?
---
Were you selling stuff on the Trading Post, as listing fees are taken out of your inventory.
---
Or, are you sure it didn't just roll over into silver or gold?  64 copper + 43 copper (selling stuff) = 1silver 7copper
---
They are going to do something about the thinning out by incorporating existing maps into future content instead of just adding a new map/zone.  They said this pretty recently.
---
Im waiting they add chaod gloves again, so better save them for a desired skin
---
Comp wise you would look for a boon rene/firebrand group instead of chrono/druid.
---
It also would really help if your group has prober burst dps so you can skip mechanics at boss and kill other stuff much faster.
---
Esp if you go with power quickbrand i would look for a static or guild where you also can have the alac rene in your group and where they maybe teach you the skips and which utilities you should use where to make everything faster and more conistent
---
Just found some today- try any Gametraders shops if you have one near you, cause they had plenty of $15 and $20 at the one I discovered today
---
i recommend to skip t3 aswell
---
dont take snowcrows raid build, look for discretize or metabattle fractal builds
---
It's the same Anet logo, just blue. I'll edit a link in here if I find the post
---
Nah it should use the Guild Wars leitmotif to make up for the boring Path of Fire character select screen music
---
Makes sense though. People in t3 are just passing through, people in t4 have likely been doing their dailies for months if not longer.
---
Generally you don't want to be selling gear to merchants
---
Also, give feedback / praise to those organizing events. I know I would like to organize some now and then but I lack the time, so I make sure to thank those who can and do invest the time / commitment.
---
&gt;has this happened to you ever
---
No.
---
&gt;coins
---
Copper? Silver? Gold?
---
1 Silver = 100 copper
---
1 gold = 100 silver
---
As soon as you have 100 copper, the game automatically converts that to 1 silver. Likewise with 100 silver into 1 gold.
---
&gt;maybe there's a banking fee
---
There isn't. There is, however, a fee each time you use a waypoint. The size of the waypoint fee depends on your character's level and distance from the waypoint used. The higher your character level and the further away you are, the more expensive the waypoint fee is. It can range from a couple of copper to nearly 7 silver for a level 80 from DR to the crystal desert.
---
&gt;I sell a bunch of old gear to the leather worker
---
... I mean you can do what you want, but I'll advise you that it is usually a better return to salvage unwanted gear instead of selling it, particularly prior to level 80.
---
No because it's a 2 hour cycle.
---
GW2hook has its own screenshots folder that organizes by date and time, rather than by number. I've hit the limit for normal game screencaps multiple times, but I never have to worry about that with that addon. Just have to worry about finding the ones I actually like before they're buried and the folder getting too big.
---
Runes of the Pack
---
Doesn’t give a ferocity bonus, but it gives power and more precision (which is more open world useful, but isn’t a super useless stat if you can get in range to use your firearms crit bonuses). The buffs at the start are nice too.
---
How can I find my API key and is it safe to use it on that website?
---
i wouldnt run this build for fractals, what matters there much more is burst dps and this isnt realy the build which has it.
---
With Valkyrie you would lose a lot crit change i wouldn't go much lower then 90 % with buffs
---
I hated that hallway of death, but I believe there was someone who made a post on reddit a while ago that showed a way around them with a slightly tricky jump that puts you out of bounds and way up on the wall.

When you step off your homenode for 1 second and a perma invis Deadeye swoops in to decap it you don't have much choice.

Log into https://account.arena.net/ with your GW2 account, go to Applications, and create a key.
---
Just a note, use silver for exotics. Black lion is practically the same as Silver fed, thing is it has 100% chance of recovering sigils/runes, so you wanna it for gear with expensive upgrades ( i.e. sigil of force)
---
A lot of us Aussies are in NA, come to NA firstly.
---
Learning dps rotations, if you're looking at the yellow cast bar on a skill with a 1sec cast time, just minus your ping from it, if your ping is 250 then cast your next skill when the yellow bar is at 75% instead of 100%.
---
In PvP don't make clutch heals. Even if you heal before someone would deal enough damage to kill you, their input to the server might register before yours, that can and will result in you healing and subsequently instantly dying. It's even a pain if you can get back up because you're heal skill will still be on CD even though it didn't do anything.
---
Practice and pre-empt everything. In raids learn specific timings relative to you and trust your gut more than the visual prompts. In PvP try to learn burst combos for every class, so you know when to dodge or block before they hit you.
---
Now they just need to make the core game story not suck xD. PoF and HoT and LW stories are really cool. Hell even LWS1 was great, but the core story about zhaitan is repetitive, boring and glitchy at best.
---
No, ((number)) means the text is encrypted. Lots of texts in the client are encrypted (hashed?) by default to avoid leaks and data-mining, and the client, I assume, can ask the server for a decryption key (or just the final text, I dunno how exactly it works) if it needs to present the text to the player. If this process fails (the text is missing on the server or the server declines the request because the text is not meant to be seen yet, or be seen by players at all) the client has no other option but to display the only info about the text it has - its ID, which is the number you see between parenthesis.
---
Double-parenthesis in general means the ((text is not meant to be seen by players)). It's used to indicate that the text is a placeholder, a work-in-progress, and thus subject to change. And sure, it also means that the text shouldn't be translated by localization teams because it's not yet final.

This build has ~400 range so there's no need to ever get extra health because you can simply stay behind other people. Valk gear is only useful if build can cap crit chance on its own and ele cant do that so it's a huge waste of dps thats not worth the gain of health. But if your dps is extremely low only from valk armor then there's something wrong with your rotations as well.
---
It's your healer's duty to keep you alive, as long as you're not facetanking damage and not being outside of their melee range. If you need extra defense you can always get arcane shield trait, there's 0 reasons not to run it. You can also take different adept trait in arcane, both provide decent defense. Tempest 3-3-3 is another small sustain increase.
---
You can try to compile wine with vkd3d, but last time i checked, it was not supporting sm5_1, which is used for texture bindings and d3dcompiler.dll(or how it named) should also be from windows.
---
Shoulda said guaranteed unlock haha
---
I do have hundreds of transmutation charges, but I have them because I buy outfits. That way if I want to change it up a bit, I don't have to sink resources into something I would change back later.
---
I know it's not what you were really talking about, but I just wanted to chime in to say I value outfits as well.
---
“That’s quality armor!”
---
Yes, they are stealing your gold!
---
I've been amassing my revive orb collection instead, its great! Yeah!
---
Tis the same with wvw where pets even stays unchanged which is sad.
---
close enough haha
---
1) yes and no. expect to do everything solo.
---
2) yes there is but good luck finding a group for pretty much anything that isn’t endgame AND worthwhile doing.
---
3)yes and no. you can earn a few extra gold if that is what you mean but there is nothing besides combat, pretty much. no fishing, hunting, woodcutting leveling system, etc.
---
4) heavily auction house
---
5) yes, if you want to join a raid guild, youll have a good time but pugs... good luck!
---
6) not sure dont use any.
---
and I like to add. if you’re a hardcore player like wow used to be and you want that feeling back, gw2 is extremely wrong game for you. osrs is better. that said, gw2 is a good game in other ways and thats why its my main mmo.
---
&gt; PVP activity
---
sPvP in GW2 is dead. 5-10 min queue times is average for everybody who is above 50% winrate. You would end up playing with the same hundred people of your timezone. There is no separate solo or duo queue and the only bearable gamemode is tournaments, witch intern lacks population.
---
WvW on the contrary do have healthy population that dwarfs sPvP and I would say is your competetive fix if you want to do mid scale to big fights.
---
&gt; Skill
---
It is bad in current meta (sometimes it is better). The most effective gameplay is to spam F1-F4 running in circles on mid point while playing Scourge.
---
It's not really our job too is it?
---
It's not inherently for translations. You can have your text be a data asset that's stored separately from all the the other assets and referenced by an ID even if you don't intend to translate it. But it surely helps to store all text in a centralized location so you don't have to collect it from all over the place when handing out to localizing teams.
---
The question was *why* is "((number))" showing up, not what the "number" *means*. My post explains the former, yours explains the latter.
---
I like colourful comics. Thx for the treat !
---
I agree with you Brazil. Although as players we can go out of our way to help new players, which is why guilds help! 
---
And we can stream, create website etc. Ultimately we are players and a customer - we shouldn't have to put the effort in to advertise their game and bring in new people and create content for them.
---
I bought 300! keys to get the shoulders, without success.

Wrong use of meme.
---
vs trashmobs: cast glyph of storms in earth...watch them being blind dealing no damage at all anymore. double points if someone pulled them all on a big pile before.
---
You stay in staff, until CA is full, then you switch to warhorn for the quickdraw 5, start CA, blast your CA skill, if warhorn is off CD quit CA to gain another quickdraw wh 5, then go back camping staff
---
Most statics that know what they are doing will prioritize safety over glass cannon meta for weekly clears. It's not about playing what's comfortable though, it's about playing builds that will ensure the success of the group still retaining a decent time for clears, because being honest, after putting the content on farm and doing it for weeks, wasting time because someone decided to test their new meme isn't fun.
---
The same should be applied to pugs if you think about it, problem being that most pugs think that they are god tier players, that they can replicate the level of synergy of grouos that played together for weeks/months, and there's no easy resource to find these builds/comps or guarantee that what you would get what toy want because they aren't listed as "meta" even though meta actually changes depending on goals, which is something many fail to comprehend.
---
For me it was a dye :)
---
bought 12 keys with gold, didn't get even 1 uncommon ._.
---
one think about Qbrand + Alacren over chrono+druid is that you can be more mobile and are less depending on pugs standing on your walls (so many don't pay attention or even care)
---
This combo mostly pulls ahead in cm (reflect helps a lot for cm100), wouldn't if one go heal the renegade spec for it? though provides the better if you go for it
---
Still remains to be seen what build templates will include. Could just be traits at the end of the day which would be less than Arc. Lets stay hopeful though
---
the ((number)) is sill only the ID, not a hash or anything. there is just not enough space to have a full text encrypted in it. of course the text in the gw2.dat is somewhat encrypted or at least compressed.
---
Yes, be happy that this all had to happen to finally get Anet off their asses and put some effort into their game...
---
Yes, it is just the string ID, but the reason it shows up instead of the underlying text is because the client was unable to access said text, because it's encrypted and the server refuses to provide keys to decrypt it, or, yeah, because it's missing.
---
See, this is why I cringe when I read people bitching about gear and mount skins.  &gt;:\\  They think the shit just grows on trees, and are totally unaware of the years of study, training and accumulated expertise required to produce the content we enjoy.  Even if you don't like a skin, you have to respect what people put into its design.
---
Take a look!
---
now it makes sense
---
Better to do clean install for now.
---
I'm not a fan of endless discussion. But people in general like to state opinions as facts on subjects that they don't really have any insight to, that's all.

---
For anyone wondering, there's a few skins in the game with parts that aren't dye-able. Phantom's Hood is one of them and it'd be so cool if ANet could let that part be dyed as well for some sick combos.
---
So I get more Lucent Motes when I use it?
---
I got some skins that were gemstore exclusive before (I think?), in this case Belinda's Greatsword and Zafirah's Rifle. They were like 25 statuettes each.
---
The commanders saying that they wipe because of this or that, just means that they have no clue how to actually command and rely on their squad to steamroll the other teams.
---
And charms/symbols
---
Also Flame legion armor flames and maybe and infinitum (Not Site about this one)
---
&gt; Anet stated that their plan was to only give the impression that the game was actively developed while their focus was on side projects.
---
Source?
---
&gt; And we have seen how the game was developed since PoF.
---
Yeah, the quality of the LW episodes increased constantly
---
Death, good.
---
Lol what? This isn't downtime... This has nothing to do with in game.
---
Every time my salvation says that I’m revealing 4 Times of Knowledge
---
its only the store, the game servers wont be affected
---
Typically........
---
Since ad infinitum is a backpack, and no backpacks are dyable, it is also not dyable
---
Before you get the potion do recommended fractals before T4s. You get one large potion of each (def, mobility, offensive). They grant 5 stacks, last for an hour, that should be enough to get you though T4s
---
As other people already said: yes it exists.
---
But you can't compare wow leveling to GW2 leveling. I have multiple max lvl chars in both games. And while lvling in WoW always felt like a chore, and I like leveling, doing so in GW2 is far more fun and MUCH faster. The classes feel much more complete even when not at max lvl, while still offering progress in the endgame (gear combinations, elite Specialisation etc.).
---
And if you are specifically asking about alts:
---
In endgame content you regularly get "tomes of knowledge", items that are account bound and give one lvl on use. They rack up over time and can make leveling really quick if you don't like it.
---
my first port of call for greys is murky grey, vintage silver or dry silver
---
Use the skills that aren't usually in your dps rotation. Use sandstorm, earth2-5 for stuns, barrier, evades. Earth/air 3 for more cc, water for more evades. Basically try using your skills. Also swapping in the arcane traitline for the shield is good. You can always swap out in proper dps traits and skills for the bosses but try to think ahead for trash mobs and adjust skills and traits accordingly.
---
Legendary armor tells you that anet doesn’t care and is trash.
---
If your commander blames the wipe for not having 2 Firebrands per group , then he is a noob.
---
1 per group is enough but also mandatory.
---
Healing from Firebrands in WvW is massivly overrated.
---
If another healer/support had the amount of stab that Firebrand has, people would start playing them instead of Firebrand.
---
Honestly, keep playing and keep experimenting. 
---
You can also see all weapon skills in the hero panel where you change traits. 
---
Apart from that, there is no secret short cut to learning skills.
---
Honestly just play the game. Open world exploration and the like will do you more than just reading the skills. Seeing what they do and realizing their purpose will help you understand (for ele at least) what the elements are trying to push you towards. 
---
Weapon skills of other classes still have a similar effect: what is the purpose of the weapon? is it damage, is it utility, what do they provide to you or a group
---
&gt; Flame legion armor flames
---
They used to be afaik. Don’t know why it was patched out.
---
I saw this yesterday and laughed my ass off
---
I have a couple necros. 
---
My norn is a blood witch that harvests the bones and other parts of animals (and sometimes people) in order to do her thing, attempting to tell the future and curing curious ailments. 
---
My sylvari styles itself as the Lord of Frost and leans heavily on necromancy for the purpose of cold and souls. 
---
And my charr eats meat and bones and puke up minions when he needs them.
---
Good thing you don't play gw1 where everyone has 1000 skills.
---
Did you not read my last paragraph? I’m open to anything, mate. Call me names all you like. 
---
I agree with you, thanks for the insight.
---
With the usual warrior/guardian endlessly spinning with twilight/sunrise/eternity!
---
I think this also has to do a lot with behavior. We got slapped around last night for roughly one hour before things improved. But we did not lose people. Sure, some left, but others joined. Generally we did not lose people. Why? Because we found fun stuff to do. Because we tried again and again and got better a bit every time. We adjusted our behavior with every attempt.
---
We get first smaller successes on the defense side, using all the means we had available. Siege and intelligence reports. The enemies tries to disrupt our supply lines with really well organized havoc sqauds, but we beat them back, because we, too, got those classes and players on them who know what they are doing. And since there was not a single kick issued, not a single grain of salt in communication, everyone feels _valued_. 
---
And in the end the strategy of the enemy blob did not work anymore. The small successes push us forward, and in the end, through concentrated effort we not only manage to survive the enemy pushes, we take them apart. And what do you know? In the end we take their home garrison.
---
'nuff said.
---
Totally did not try to read all of that out loud xD
---
Did i say it was in-game downtime?
---
they have at least 1 major project going on, which is planned to release in 2020
---
Never said it was :)
---
Damn that hood looks like it would fit well on my edgy asura reaper. Wiki says it's unavailable but is it going to be available next halloween?
---
Usually a person would 1v4 on an uncontested enemy point for about 20 seconds (then die) to make the point that his teammates are useless.

3 Empyreal Fragments

I do agree with you on the last part - it would make the story mode diverse and interesting. But the risk of having multiple playable races is that sometimes things wont make sense and would go against lore, thats why gw1 worked out so well - it was primarily focused on human lore with other races acting as allies throughout the story. Going back to the original point of the post, It think people who are not in favor of Cantha either didnt play gw1 or weren't paying attention. Yes, the story was focused on humans but Cantha is populated by many other races and beings - Naga, Tengu , Celestials etc. It doesn't have to be all about humans, and after 250 years and with the deep sea dragon's activity we don't know what could be going on there. Gw2 being soo sooo focused on the Elder Dragons will deal with that primarily should we ever visit Cantha. My own point was that Cantha is dear to old gw1 players and for people who never played gw1, this will be a new area. But let's see, after the last (arguably disappointing) expansion, I would rather have one with quality content, i dont much care who they re going to focus on.
---
So far Generation 1 focus "The Minstrel", and the Gen 2 warhorn, Verdarach.

What are some animated GS skins I can get which aren't nearly or fully impossible to get?  I've got an Asura, and I'm looking to skin my GS.  I'd prefer something flaming, but any type of glowy/animated look would do.  Also, I'd prefer it to be as large as possible since I like the comical look of my GS being as big as my body.
---
I don't have 600g to spend.  I'm hoping for something I can either farm, or purchase with a more easily attainable game currency than gold.

Thanks!
---
The Steam Player Statistics are a good reference that works for any other games.
---
https://store.steampowered.com/stats/
---
Where that graph peaks, players in GW2 often also peak.
---
meh. not worth it , if you already have a copper. because you have to pay for the runesalvage kit  to begin with , and it costs 10x to use , and what it returns is mostly crap.
---
People has hardly any time to watch streams. Too busy completing all the things they have to do in-game.
---
We've only got this many major releases so far, and the next one will be in a few weeks.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Release
---
I know it isn't that much, but it's still enough to keep people busy, and there's regular festivals between releases too.
---
&gt; Even in weird corners of the world where you don't really expect people I run into people.
---
\*loud whispers:* (They are following you)
---
Still better than those win trading fucks. If he reached to 10 with a reaper, I don't even know what to say.
---
300ms ping hurts...
---
1) Is the world busy? Will I meet players outside of endgame zones, or should I expect to do the new player leveling mostly solo?
---
* This used to be a bit emptier except in a few zones until a while ago. I do not know what happened. It may have been the pull of mounts, but there's way more people spread all over the place these days. 
---
2) Sort of related to 1, is there a looking for group system where I can party up with people looking to do similar content without necessarily knowing them or having ever actually met them?
---
* Yes. But some of the categories are not used that well. For example, hardly anyone puts LFG entries for Story. And during festivals, people often put their LFGs in the 'open world parties' instead in the 'festivals' category. The game should do a better job at teaching players how to use it.
---
3) Is there an interactive professions system that rewards players for really going for the crafting or gathering of top tier stuff?
---
* Crafting 'professions' are called "disciplines" in GW2. One won't get rich quickly by crafting, but it's possible to get some profit with a bit of research. There's things that are much harder to obtain without crafting, like ascended gear.  And things that are impossible to get without crafting, like legendary gear. 
---
4) How is the economy fueled? Is it heavily “Auction House” based or more so a direct player to player trade system?
---
* The economy is entirely player-driven. There's no auctions. The trading system allows people to post tons of buy and sale offers for all sorts of items, but the prices are set and fixed with the offer. Put it too high, nobody buys, put it too low, you lose out. There's a tax and a deposit on the seller; if you cancel a sell offer, you lose the deposit, but the tax is only paid on selling. Trading directly is risky and dangerous since it's done by sending a mail with the items directly, and there's no guarantee the other person will send anything back.  
---
5) What should I expect if I were interested in endgame raiding? Are there active groups always running raids? Is there a chance for me to experience old stuff, or has the player base moved onto the current content.
---
* You should start with raiding guides and videos, then look for training raids. Training raids are a bit of a misnomer, since they won't really train you from scratch, they almost always want you to know the content and your profession beforehand.
---
6) is there any sort of third party add-on support that would allow me to modify my UI?
---
* There's no third party addon support at all, but some people have made some addons, and some of them have been allowed.  As long as they do not offer any advantage that allows you to win more easily in combat or get rewards without deserving them, and as long as the program can't be confused with a program that isn't allowed (e.g.: using similar files),  then it will usually be fine. If the program doesn't interact with the game's primary memory, it's usually fine.
---
I know this is a lot to ask, and dare I say somewhat nit picky, but I know myself to dive in head first and really sink time and effort into expansive games, and I just really want to be sure I’m ready for what I’m about to dive into.
---
Hey, I just bought the full package and tried out different classes to level 15 and I think Necromancer + going Reaper (AOE dmg + giant sword/scythe) later on is the best choice, its really a lot of fun :p       
---
Ive watched numerous guides on this game, some even of 50+ minutes length (with 1.5x speed though) and there is still so much that overwhelms me          
---
      
---
Is there anything that a new player could potentially miss out or forget while leveling? As I understood I just have to follow the hearts and scopes while leveling and do the green/mainstory quests somewhere inbetween right?     
---
     
---
Should I use my level 80 boost but complete all the zones normally or would it be a waste? Im in no rush and I really enjoy doing the quests and finding vistas         
---
Its just that I would like to stop questing now and then and join those big open world boss raids, saw a video of a giant drake in some swamp, that looked cool      
---
Appreciate any answers, cheers!
---
I never see anyone actually talk on this game, maybe a bit of chatting in the map chat but that's it just standing around afk or going somewhere.
---
Prove it or stay shut
---
Damn. Makes sense tho
---
I can't, it's account bound, lulz.
---
Why do you have to remind me of this dreaded [achievement](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aeb4ys/new_achievement_carry_the_creator/)!? ;\_;
---
And if they didn't say anything at all people would've gotten their hopes down which is probably even worse for the game

These post remind of *The Creativity Song* from *Don't Hug me I'm Scared*.

Read this as "Phantom of The Hood"
---
Getting ready to.  Well, getting ready to learn anyway.
---
- The communication has gotten *substantially* better.
---
- They're still churning out things that were developed pre-layoffs, so we don't know if or how the layoffs will their work going forward.
---
This is a delicate period where things could've gone quickly disintegrated and it's been navigated well. However, we don't really know yet whether it's a temporary state or if everything's fine now that they're focused on GW2 instead of Guild Wars Immortal or whatever it was.
---
Dont forget about the PvP version!
---
Depends on if you want to play the newer content.
---
Maybe next year.
---
Lol, my bad.  Glowing.  A week ago, I saw a character with a sword which was on fire.  Looked awesome.  I took a pic and posted it here, and turns out it was some thing which required you to have played way back when, and can no longer get the currency and so now I'm on a mission to find a replacement.  My favorite look is an asura with a huge flaming great sword, and as a soulbeast, I can pull this off .
---
I wish I could go back to the HoT one
---
There is no underlying text. "((404946))" would be the actual string for string id 404946. Nothing at all would be displayed for rc4 encrypted strings that the client cant decrypt.
---
Depends. I see this meme a lot but a lot of the time:
---
The enemy wipes your teammates first, which is why they have the luxury of zerging you, then you feel like you are "1v4" when really, your team is mostly dead so its like 4v4 as far as the map is concerned.
---
People tend to be very shortsighted in PvP.
---
&lt;cries in Article 13&gt;
---
Na or Eu does matter tho
---
When the elder dragons weren't the biggest threat tyria faced.
---
**Sigh** 
---
Have an upvote, you monster.
---
It wouldn't have gotten hopes down, it would've led people to expect things to continue as they were going until that stuff was actually ready.
---
It's actually had the exact opposite effect. ANet has claimed multiple times that they were planning to release the next raid wing with a shorter delay than the previous for example, while the time between wings was only getting longer:
---
W1 to W2: 113 days
---
W2 to W3: 99 days
---
W3 to W4: 240 days
---
W4 to W5: 294 days
---
W5 to W6: 305 days
---
And all the while inbetween they were telling people to get their hopes up because release dates were going to be less far apart from each other and a 2nd raid team was being trained.
---
The ELI5 summary: FB is an all purpose cornerstone support for the party providing stab, resist, cleanse and boon conversion, AoE stunbreak, triple blast finisher if you want to use combos, aegis, reflect/projectile destruction, res power with MI, might,  quickness, protection, regeneration, swiftness, retal, decent CC, 200 toughness on engage, +25% stamina regeneration to 10 targets, healing modifiers, passive healing and active healing. 
---
This is for 5 to 10 targets. You only need 1 good FB per party.
---
Healing is secondary and is what separates the average firebrand from the good ones. Your healing is predominantly from aegis, dodging, passive heals and weapon skills. Tome 2 is not a healing tome. Both scrapper and tempest completely outclass FB in this area. The difference between having all of the other benefits FB gives and not having it is immense.

The 2nd half of your paragraph is to do with the 'Madonna/whore dichotomy' and the 'male gaze' phenomenon.
---
There has been a differentiation of women who are 'motherly or pure' vs 'whores to use and discard' throughout centuries of socialisation. Of course, women aren't some homogeneous entity, but people with their own multifaceted thoughts and of course, different approaches for different occasions. E.g. mothers would like to dress sexy once in a while. Sadly, this has been washed over throughout history and is only newly becoming a point of contention due to women having enough clout to speak up and some men speaking up out of solidarity too.
---
How does this relate? Well, men are comfortable being catered to in video games as there is no emotional attachment or expectation of purity for pixelated characters. Men also don't mind women dressing sexy or being bare chested until you tell them, their daughter or younger sister would like to dress sexy. They are not "whores" because they are "pure", thus they must cover up and be respectable. 
---
I am simplifying a massively complex social construct that has happened throughout years and years of Western/Catholic/European socialisation, but I hope it fascinates you enough to read further on the subject.
---
In this post, I use 'men' in a very general sense, because of course, not all men are like this, and not all women are either, but it does go to show, this isn't as much a double standard against men, as it is women.
---
Well, 2-2 has birds and 2-3 kind of invented slippery slope.

Daily achievements are good because that 2g is well worth the time spent doing them: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Daily

There's a ton of other stuff that also resets daily, like achievements in living world maps, crafting things(huge if you want to craft ascended stuff), gathering stuff(at least guild hall and a packed home instance), items that convert stuff and vendors that restock daily. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Server_reset

His disagreement with you is reasonable and you haven't managed to address any of it logically, this sentence is just showcasing how you fail incredibly hard at it.
---
I'd say you are the one dragging like a worm.
---
&gt; It had to be already in the works for the period leading up to the layoffs, or they couldn't just pump stuff like that out immediately.
---
Maybe I'm just coldhearted, but people are giving Anet way too much credit with these kind of comments. They suffered mass layoffs because they poorly managed this game for an extended period of time. The reason we've seen an instant change is because they were forced to move all of their staff back onto Guild Wars 2, which means things are being developed and given to us much more quickly because they actually have people working on them now. Guild Wars 2 is going to be a better product because NC Soft stepped in and told Anet they weren't allowed to do things the way they were doing them before.

they already buff reaper the last 2 patches. i happened to jump into this static pug once, 2 reapers, heal fb, and hybrid renegade. i dealt average 22.5-27k dps on my condi quickbrand. pots, food, uti, fractal champ. everyone in group fractal champs too with heal brand fractal god, rene fractal prodigy. 2 reapers out dps me by a big margin in CMs. around hitting 31-34.8k. 
---
not to mention all the big guys on SC or similar sites aren't prefer necro in general cuz their attacks seem slow, just glance at the rotation on SC and you feel like it could have been improved for both specs, especially condi scourge.  
---
they're not lacking burst, they're lacking a good rotation example to show, imo. of course dh is king of burst already, but if rotation executed, you can easily out dps dh. seen many before.   
---
there was a time condi was so cheesy on reaper, everyone starting to have a necro to roll in fractals. not sure if you play around the time. but lfg was necro only and i thought it was funny. until it became a meme with so many nerfs. haha. it's still cheesy in wing 5.   
---
but on this sub, any person with the necro tag, trust that they're good. i agree with the person below. don't have the mentality that class A, class B is trash just cuz you main and play highest burst class.
---
it's as much automated as is currently possible. hot chests and daily crafts only got added to the api a couple of days ago afaik.

I don't disagree with what you say here but to be honest most skewed matches are because of low population especially in off hours rather than duo queue.
---
A solo player will obviously have an extremely difficult (if not impossible) time to get rank 1 but you can certainly get legend. My position here is that I just find duo queue more fun I'd rather play with a friend in an MMO than solo. 
---
Pure solo would be 'fairer' but honestly I think a lot of people wouldn't have as much fun myself included. I'd probably just play ATs and avoid ranked.
---
Those owls are awful
---
Omg yes. This would make me so happy
---
The griffon is a kind of fun that the Skyscale won't replicate, because they work quite differently. I encourage you to get the griffon now while you feel motivated.
---
I don't think anyone could interpret that from my reply
---
There's really no reason to play fb as a healer, the modifiers are garbage and outside of aegis heals and dodging they lack good sustained healing. You can make a case for the tenacious defender build just for damage mitigation, but any comp running multi-hit skills shits on aegis.
---
       
---
Try playing some marauder/commander power quickbrand. 100% party might, retal, quickness, fury, protection, and stab. You won't do the damage of a zerker rev, but you can contribute 2x as much damage than you can healing.
---
I don't know much about Mistlock. 
---
Someone else said something similar, but I'm with a quick use of their eyeballs they determined otherwise haha
---
Lots of AP from the griffon so if you think you're ever going to want to get that easy AP go for it
---
Awesome!
---
Here's to hoping the wave of API updates ends up including more
---
And 4 obviously had some momentum, and in 2 horses can be quite dumb. There we go mysteries solved.
---
Be prepared for the even longer grind that is world 2. I suggest you do w2z3 first because compared to that, everything's a breeze.
---
Alright then, guess I'm wrong about the encryption part.
---
Still makes you wonder why do these strings exist. And moreover why do items and other content, which previously was being displayed just fine, sometimes turn into these ((number)) strings. I still think that they're just text that isn't meant to be seen by players, be it because it's from yet unreleased content, or deprecated content, or dev-only content etc. And sometimes for whatever reason existing content get incorrectly whitelisted/blacklisted for inclusion in the client, hence turning into these undefined strings. Occasionally when some dev content slips through (like those "Delete Me!" achievements) or people create chatlinks for yet unreleased items, their contents are displayed as ((number))s.
---
Yea that dude that you replied to pretty much sums it up.  In the right situations griffon can travel through half the map you're in like 10 seconds (I'm guessing lol). It's great in maps where you know the terrain and if you know how to access high ground. Obviously almost useless in core maps because there are so many waypoint. I find griffon OP in HoT maps.
---
Of course you dont. Go get carried some more.
---
OMG THANK YOUUUu!
---
pretty sure opencommunity didn't shut down, it just took a break and a rebuild
---
What will be the point of the springer after skyscale?
---
Haha me and Niko power duo son
---
I find this really annoying too. Maybe a quality of life update in the future?
---
YEs, i figured it out now. Thanks a lot. I'll go remove my ticket.
---
You can see it in logfile: d912pxy/log.txt (for rather new versions and up).
---
That's beside the point. Worldwide is kind of self explanatory.
---
it's almost never useful, any situation in which you could use it you can do better with gliding or land mounts. it's fun as a novelty but it can't use updrafts so it's useless in VB. it only really shines when you jump off a really high place and it will take longer to find a high enough place to jump from in most maps than it would to just use raptor, jackal or rollerbeetle to get there on land.
---
I want my t3 pugs to lower me into my grave so they can let me down one last time.
---
And i think it is fine you enjoy duoq, but that should be what unranked is.
---
Competitive is about equal grounds. When you introduce another layer of ways to have an edge over others, then you make it a must-have in order to remain "competitive". I get it, I too like to play with people, but you do have to admit that it is without questions, VERY unfair for those on the receiving end.
---
Also, neither of us have stats, true, but from my anecdotal experience, guildies and friends stopped playing in part because of this uneven matches (granted most of it happened during the dynamicQ fiasco, but duoQ is still the same, jsut fewer people in a single premade at one time).
---
I'm just curious, what would the rank of these people be if they were forced to play on the same ground as everyone else? Can you imagine, if everyone had to play on the same rule sets?
---
I am currently playing power dragon hunter and am confused about my rotation, I am mainly focusing on fractals and not raid. I am currently confused between the power dragonhunter rotation provided by SnowCrow and Discretize, SnowCrow’s rotation is longer while Discretize’s is noticeably shorter and the rotation ends with “repeat” but some skills like sword of justice will still be on CD on the next rotation. Really lost and would appreciate it if someone can clarify this for me.
---
his method does work, i tried it today.  Before you take the eagle you can go forward all the way to the next check point with the mini ninja boss fight without getting that , and then die, use the eagle, and then it is possible to backtrack all the way to that same check point you didn't get before the eagle.  i.e. your able to access all locations in the level.  One thing of note, after shortcut eagle, get the baubles on top of that platform and immediately gg because if you get a check point you won't be able backtrack (as best I can tell).
---
I'm a little confused on the town clothing mechanic. If I convert an endless clothing tonic into an outfit, can that outfit be worn in combat? Does it need to be reapplied?
---
*circlejerk dogpile*
---
I think duo affects mostly the extreme high end, there are a few players with insane winrates in the upper echelons but I don't think it's that important in 'normal' play.
---
The unfairness comes from the low population and general apathy of the community with regards to winning.
---
ok I spent some time today investigating it, and I can confirm your right.  There is one small caveat, which is after the shortcut eagle and the baubles on the high platform, you need to /gg to be taken back to the checkpoint before the teleportation portals (alternatively, you can jump from the high up platform, but you only get one chance at this jump).  As best I can tell, if you get the check point right after shortcut eagle, you will be locked out of backtracking.
---
It hasn't shown fractal level for a while, it shows AR now instead
---
I am a bit late to respond, but I can see why the minion skills do not function like this in gw2 (except for Jagged Horrors). I mean, if a substantial number of minions could only be generated after several fights, then minions would be rather niche and they would be inaccessible for quite a lot of PvE encounters (e.g. pretty much any first boss in dungeon/frac/raid). Also, if you are able to kill a good number of mobs to raise an army, this would mean that you are doing just fine without them and you don't even use all of your minions half the time anyway.
---
Yes your correct.  I went in there today to see if it was possible based on the other comment, and you've got it exactly right.
---
&gt;Is there anything that a new player could potentially miss out or forget while leveling? As I understood I just have to follow the hearts and scopes while leveling and do the green/mainstory quests somewhere inbetween right?     
---
Just wanted to make sure you understand, hearts on their own, not a terribly lucrative way to get exp
---
The amount of work that goes into doing a heart versus the amount of exp you get from the heart isn't always worth it, especially since some hearts can get mildly frustrating.
---
Experience can be earned practically by doing anything. Anytime you explore and find something new, that's exp. Points of interest, vistas, waypoints, all experience. Gathering things gives experience. Etc.
---
If you want to do the hearts, by all means, go ahead. But it works out best if you can coordinate the heart with a nearby event, since often they end up in the same area.
---
I could already feel its evil from the Thumbnail ; clicked on it to confirm that it was indeed what I felt.
---
Mike z said the advertising took a year of planning. It didn't happen because of the layoffs. It's terrible advertising at that. Those posters and their arrangement are bad. The video adverts are bad. Their marketing team are apparently good at analysing data and segmenting customers but their actual delivery of ads leaves a lot to be desired.
---
The roadmap was already there too. They were already planning to go straight to season 5 and build templates were in the works for a long time.
---
All that's changed is Mike came out and gave us more transparency over their roadmap, and why? Because of PR. He had to abate our concerns as the uncertainty would have cause a backlash and a loss of players. Also, because it would have looked really, really bad if we suddenly saw their posters and videos popping up and were still left in the dark about the game's future post layoffs. The community would have jumped to all the worst conclusions that this was some panic attempt to bring players in to keep it afloat. That communication, and lets face it it's only really a one off at this point in time, was nothing more than a band aid and PR manoeuvre.
---
I love this game and for the most part I love Arenanet, but come on people. Take your noses out of their asses long enough to realise that's some pretty thick shit you've been sniffing and wake up to how the real world works.
---
fuck off :)
---
People like you have ruined ranked almost completely by banning premades. Anet removed duo once and added it back because they killed what was left of this gamemode by making ranked solo-only. 
---
PvP is living hell in soloQ. Conquest was designed for premades of 5, anything below that is torture.
---
No problem, glad we could help!
---
Got to bring in as many people as possible when your whole company depends on one game.
---
Agreed, some clever ideas there. I think it would give us a chance to maybe head back to Maguuma, I remember a story step there when you had to use an Itzel Warbler to detect stealthed enemies.
---
Go for it, it’s worth it, very diverse mount for sure.
---
The new mount looks cool and it seem to be for specific function in the next episode, more about climbing walls. It’s something between griffin and a springer that can attach it self on walls and won’t slide down.
---
Zerk tempest/weaver can top charts
---
Top players would still be top players, duoQ works in other games and has worked n gw2, too bad the gamemode is so dead that imbalanced games happen consistantly though that happens without duo as well.
---
This applies to any business, no matter how much services or products they offer.
---
Yeah who cares if your group gets caught in grav wells inside a giant scourge/rev bomb, you have the power of DPS on your side!  
---
Firebrand's primary role is a stab-bot. The healing and condi cleanse/resistance is just icing on the cake. Yes there are better healers, but they don't have the stab-spam that FB does.
---
Yeah, the mount system from GW2 is definitely the best ever made, for me. The way it interacts with maps, enabling you to acess a whole new perspective everytime, alongside with the gravity action and all that makes you just want to ride them forever.
---
The game can, however, be lackluster in content for people that has been playing it for years. But, as we do not have gear treadmill, you can stop playing and get back to it whenever you want. I am on a 3 month break and I intend to go back playing as soon as I have the time.
---
That said, enjoy the game. It surely has a nice and welcoming world for you.
---
The problem is, I don't have any other class/build I can play on p1 Niveau.
---
I'm getting downvoted for complimenting the uptime of the GW2 services.  
---
Never change, hivemind.
---
World 3 maybe
---
Biggest gripe with the game, tbh. They created the perfect fashion game, with barely no loot treadmill, great events and content to put all those fashion items behind grinds and bosses. But then they go around, and limit all of those incredibly, via not allowing lots of things to be dyed, most outfits being a 1-piece-fits-all-slots, etc. A real shame, and it's way too late to hope it will ever be fixed, sadly.
---
It should be implemented that duoq players will end up in a game with duoq players. If their que gets longer, amen.
---
yea cuz playing with someone you know and can coordinate with is exactly the same as merely being in a group with a random stranger from lfg..
---
I was about to start working towards griffon, but I decided to wait til skyscale is out. I have two priorities right now in terms of big gold sinks - griffon, and a new character slot. Personally I just decided to swap the order of these priorities and save gold for a character slot instead of going for griffon first (which was the original plan). Knowing myself, I'm assuming it would take me until the new episode is released to finish griffon anyways so in my case it's not like I'm giving up the chance at a flying mount sooner. That being said I'm pretty sure, at the end of the day, I'll want both... but yeah, I'm gonna wait and see what skyscale is like before I spend 250g.
---
*John Wick turns his head*
---
I've had this happen so many times. Distracted 2+ players on the enemy team by playing smart... and my team loses all the remaining points.
---
I mean they've known their MMR system doesn't even handle solo queue - let alone do queue - properly for years, and they've never addressed it.  Is it really an abuse of the system if A.Net doesn't even try to address it?
---
Has anybody got a video of the Terry Crews ad? I kind of want to see this
---
Haven’t played in years. Please elaborate I’m lost T-T meta memes are hard
---
But you are a PvE scrub! You should suck at PvP!!!
---
/s
---
oh thanks!
---
At least this one looks like a random person took the picture this time not an advertising agency.
---
/u/gogi_apparatus if ye are passing by again would you be able to take closer images of the two posters?
---
In this case I was 1v2 mid since the start of the game for about 30 seconds, then #3 showed up for another 30 and finally #4.
---
If I had left to go help the team then they'd just get crushed harder due to the 1-2 people simply following with me.
---
how to nerf a class 101
---
Oh shit I must be blind. Wasn't paying attention properly. Will edit thanks!
---
I'm surprised they don't have separate ranking systems for solo/team like almost every other competitive multiplayer game, StarCraft and DotA off the top of my head.
---
Thank you for the work you’ve put in to this. It’s been a great series!
---
Gilded with 3 updoots. Wow
---
It just rotated out of Black Lion Statuettes this Tuesday.
---
But then they can't sell 3 variations of the same skin with different colors.
---
Fucking angel wings and glint eyes.
---
No worries, they were definitely going for Terry Crews energy with this ad.
---
No, cause there's Photoshop.
---
Hug your healer, kite/cc away aggro'd mobs (Air dagger5), focus on your DPS. Fractals are all about "kill it before it kills you" and Weaver embodies this belief. If your healer sucks, you will die. Also, trait Fresh Air and when things get hairy in rotation go **Water**\&gt;sword**3**\&gt;sword**2**; **Air**\&gt;sword**2**\&gt;dagger**5**, this will give you a dodge, 2 burst heals, and regen.
---
There's nothing socially awkward about a chaos skin drop.
---
if that's the case - do you have any data on that? can you do a golem burst test and tell how much the burst is on both of the classes in worse conditions (less boons)?
---
Serpents Ire in Vabbi is done tomorrow evening in EU.
---
ANET does not announce what is going to be rotated into the Gemshop in advance.
---
I was in a similar situation as you are. Just started back 2 months ago after quitting just before HoT release. I finally caved and sunk the gold and time for the griffon and it has been an amazing investment. It’s true—you can do most of what a griffon can with the other mounts but I found that the griffon gave me a freedom in traveling large air-space maps that I didn’t have before. One good example is the freedom I now have in Verdant Brink to navigate the upper islands.
---
If you can spare the gold, the collection is pretty fun to completed, too. Just keep in mind a few of the steps rely on events to spawn so read up on those first so you can catch them while you’re clearing other parts of those maps. 
---
Best of luck!
---
If you compare wow mounts to gw2, it's like wow has only one mount with different skins.
---
It's just like wow except, there is loading screen when you change zones.
---
Well... yes.
---
Just because a thing isn't officially forbidden doesn't make it morally correct. Just because the system is flawed in a way that allows you to take advantage of it doesn't mean that using those flaws to your advantage isn't abuse. People know full well when they're doing something that puts them at an unfair advantage in an environment that is supposed to be competitive and is clearly *supposed* to match people of similar MMR.
---
Don't fall prey to the twisted logic of liars and cheats. "Just because I *can* do it means it's okay." Be better than that.
---
/r/GuildRecruitment is a good place to look for guilds that advertise and their specialities. 
---
You should also state here whether you are NA or EU so people can hopefully provide feedback on Serpent's Ire event for you.
---
Higher level fractals have modifiers (the diamond signs on the bottom right), some of them quite.. beloved, shall we say. OP has seen fit to suggest that it would be a splendid idea to add them (and in particular those two) to SAB's tribulation mode.
---
OP probably couldn't find the video because it's unlisted. I had to *steal* the link from somewhere (I main Thief).
---
and here i thought the rats where the ones who talked the most and yets its the norns
---
I know you're not gonna like this, but here goes anyway.  I play on a wide screen monitor.  My bank does not reset to center, it instead will open and close in it's last position, even after going to a new map.  
---
I can have inventory open along side it without any overlap.   I do get overlap when I open up the Mystic Forge in addition, but that is ok because I can click exposed portion of the desired window to pull up the desired window when I am in that "mode".
---
Wanted to know which traits are important to a Mirage on raiding with a Scepter, Gonna use it on Largos 
---
Have
---
Illusios: 3/3/3
---
Dualing 3/1/2
---
Mirage 1/3/1
---
Should I have Scepter solo or with a axe included in it?
---
Scepter / Pistol
---
Torch
---
Or
---
Axe /torch?
---
Golden fractal capacitor first pls.
---
symbols are currently 14s, 37s, 48s and charms are 24s, 40s, 1g20s. You may think its not worth, but that does not make it so. Its not a huge omfg gold is rolling in im mega rich now! Its enough to cover the increased salvaged cost and turn a bit extra profit.
---
Oooooooooooooooooooooooh I get it thanks =]
---
How did this German get in my Korean MMO?
---
It's time based and not map based
---
Yes. It looks good when you have no other windows/tabs open, it really does, but the moment you try juggling multiple windows it gets so messy.
---
You can never have too much treasure
---
It's a reality of MMO development that their studios roll over capital earned from one game into other projects. If you're a MMO verteran, you can probably list many such cases. Cryptic studios had a revolt on their hands when they essentially stopped development on Champions and used the funds earned from those players to build Star Trek Online.
---
I don't know what other projects Anet was working on. At this point, don't care. If NCSoft's edict was to refocus on GW2, I'm glad. Drive this game and its development. Don't abandon it slowly by neglect and lack of resources.
---
Some anecdotal solutions, but all worth a shot:
---
Continuously press skill buttons during cutscenes to keep connection alive.
---
Use [command line arguments](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Command_line_arguments) -repair to make sure game files are intact, then -clientport 443 to make it less likely your ISP will drop the connection.
---
Try connecting through different means. (Commonly, change from Wireless to Wired.)
---
Reset your Router, and double-check router settings to give priority to GW2.
---
The last dialogue of the upper level was interesting. Too bad it didn't continue.
---
that's not at all what dulfy's guide says. she simply states the general rotation, and says that you get the item for the map you get spat out at. your point of entry is irrelevant, and the guide doesn't suggest otherwise.
---
you might have an easier time using shamans timer that /u/_Sorrows_ already linked.
---
Great work !
---
I don't understand the unfair advantage argument.  They still play the game like everyone else, there's no cheating / hacking / botting / anything of the sort.  It's a fairly played match despite the matchmaking and rating deficiencies.
---
I don't really care about what a rating system is supposed to do, I care what it does.  If the MMR system barfs obviously like this, then don't take it seriously.
---
Griffon is alot of fun. Alot. When I was first getting the griffon I hummed and hawed over the 250g like most folks. It is 100% worth the 250g imo.
---
It's never been in the store directly, so I doubt it will go there in future. It was an RNG black lion chest drop at one point, and has come back in two forms. 1) Black Lion Statuettes and 2) the Black Lion Exclusive Chest that is sellable on the TP for stupid amounts of gold. 
---
Your best bet really is to save up 60 statuettes and wait for it to come back around in those chests. You can get keys through story achievements, map completions or of course buy em in the gem store.
---
It's a colibri... that's just how rl colibries look like too (just in huge lol). Personally while I like the skin well enough, I wouldn't want to own it. The constant wing movement is too annoying when waiting on something.
---
I didn't do any of that and i got 600g skin. Rng is rng...
---
37% is pretty decent. It was 50% on the ArenaNet site a few weeks ago, so I wouldn't count on it dropping back down to that low again anytime really soon.
---
If you're looking for a pure black on the face part, you might wanna fully unlock the Reaper elite spec, as unlocking the last trait gives you a [headpiece](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Reaper%27s_Hood) that should give you the aesthetic you're looking for.
---
37% is a decent reduction, if you're impatient, I'd say go for it. There will probably be a 50% sale in the next few months from ANet directly, but that could be anywhere between now and August (GW2's birthday). Depends how long you can wait out for that extra 13% :)

My male human necromancer (Arren Vahr) was an orphan from a very young age. He was taken in by an elderly necromancer. Although poor, she cared for him. In fact, that carried through in all her actions. Although she was distrusted, she used her magic in benign ways such as by scaring away bandits without hurting them or by healing people using her own lifeforce. And in order not to scare the ordinary folk she secluded herself. Having lost her husband years ago, she taught Arren the ways of the necromancer when he showed an interest and aptitude for the arts as well as to be kind and caring. 
---
Arren, although taught this way, was conflicted. He found it difficult to bear how a gentle soul such as his mother was treated by those who came to her in times of need. That and in the poor neighbourhood gangs were unopposed by the Queen's Guard. Thus, while his mother's teachings had left their mark, so did anger, frustration, distrust and a thirst for justice find their way into his heart. And when his mother passed away, Arren was alone at her grave. And he took his mother's books and studied for anything.. **anything** to give him the power to stand up against injustice.
---
While during his adventures he learned to know more good people, he remains intolerant of injustice and slow to trust. And those who harm the innocent.. will suffer.
---
the youtubers get way more views than any streams get, people want to play the game not watch it, especially after PoF. the game has changed dramatically, all for the better, since PoF. its been a very welcome and very active 2 years, and the people joining the subreddit has been growing really fast recently, i guess from the new commercials and sales theyve been having

My asura scourge was a krewe apprentice who went to the Crystal Desert with his krewe and ended up becoming fascinated by Joko's Awakened. He's been trying to recreate the process, but he's still very young and impulsive and has zero restraint in his experiments, so his efforts have been unsuccessful and probably hilarious (albeit highly immoral). He even dresses himself in a desert mummy theme, and doesn't realize that his skull facepaint looks cute rather than scary on him.
---
My charr always leaned heavily towards magic, like his sire before him, and always got a hard time from the other cubs in the fahrar over it. Still, he's completely, loyally Iron Legion to the bone, and began to apply the principles of engineering to his magical creations. Sure, his minions are organic, but he thinks of them as machines in the way he puts them together and the way he deploys them. They are disposable machines of war, but much faster to create and repair than metal and engines. It's all about efficiency... and his other reaper abilities are the natural result of an inquiring mind experimenting with his own magic. He's still a bit of an oddball in the Iron Legion, though, and he's not sure if his current "special assignment"  with the Pact is because he excels or because they'd rather shunt an embarrassment elsewhere. It's fine. *He* knows he's an asset, and that's good enough.

I do POF meta trains. I've earned between 60-90 gold in one night.

Dota's playerbase is also several times larger than gw2's.
---
For a second i wanted to ask what armor is this^^.
---
Springer ascends faster.
---
dota is also a lot more balanced than gw2 pvp will ever be, which is the reason why gw2 pvp playerbase is so small
---
&gt;jackal (...) is almost entirely useless.
---
Then you're doing something wrong. Jackal works better on uneven/steep terrain, can jump as high as he wants and reset the fall damage by using the dodge skill, and it's base speed is higher if you disregard the dodge skill (for lazy people who like to use autorun).

* Huntsman would be the one making fishing rods. It'd be impractical to split them between disciplines.
---
* It'd be better if the way to get better rods was by impressing Fisher masters with your catches, then they'll give you new rod and bait recipes.
---
 * Rods should not be gathering tools like pickaxes and harvesting sickles. They should be a Novelty like balloons. Novelties would get a 6th category for tools, and it'll include a novelty to use your fishing rod, the postion rewinder, the white mantle portal, a new tool to quickly use WvW blueprints and the like. This way we'd be able to use the fishing rod while using a chair, and while riding a skimmer in the middle of a lake, since we'd be able to use the novelty without pressing F by a node like with other gathering nodes. This also allows having fishing areas all over the world without placing nodes. So it'd be possible to have hidden fish in spots like on a water well. 
---
* Not just monsters. Any decent fishing system would also include other creatures, and events. For example, you could sometimes get an annoyed quaggan, or start an event against an angry krait. 
---
* On top of having new food recipes, there should also be recipes for bait crafted with cooking. To add a sink for all these useless foods no one buys, baits would require "food crumbs" to craft, a new material obtained by salvaging foods.
---
* For monetization, there could be new fishing rod skins that you select from the wardrobe. It would not be a good idea to make gemstore chair and mount skins required to fishing, but it would be a good idea to make skins with a fishing theme, like

I'm not duoq for the "advantage" I just dont find the game fun playing it by myself. win or lose its just not fun when you're not shooting the shit with friends.

Trust me I'm on your side here... but after all these years dealing with anet as a wvw main I'm just saying I really honestly don't believe that anet cares about competitive game modes.. or ever will.
---
Sure.  Lets measure the highest burst we can do without any boons/conditions in x seconds (defined to be total damage / total time).  Ill do this by doing the normal rotation for about 15 seconds to make sure I don't walk over to the console to kill the golem too quick.   
---
Now, what should x be?  Well since my whole point is that if your chrono isn't getting quickness out fast, it hurts the dgh more than the necro (note: not enough for the necro to be better, which is never what I claimed), id say about the amount of time it takes a focus phantasm to become a clone so they can do an extended cs.  Chances are, a chrono who does this isn't running chronophantasma, so about 7 seconds.  
---
My best necro dps after 7 seconds:
---
https://dps.report/UeYX-20190413-141815_golem
---
19.8k for necro
---
My best for dh after 7 seconds
---
https://dps.report/dmPa-20190413-152003_golem
---
23.7k
---
So, without any boons, dh burst is 1.19 strong than necro burst.  Using your numbers, with boons dh burst is 1.6 times necro burst.  So we can see the disparity is less when we don't have boon.
---
How are you even getting drops like these past 10 ive opened have all been material bags or revive orbs smh
---
If you are trying to learn the skills of other classes the best way is playing them, otherwise the only thing you should know is what they can do in general by identifying their weapon set and elite specialization. For example, if I see a Mesmer using Staff and Axe/Torch, I'm pretty sure he is a Condi Mirage.
---
If you are trying to learn Necro now, the best way is take your time to read the skills, get familiar with a weapon set and only change it when you get used to the skills of it.

Wow, looks amazing!!

good luck finding a guild

&gt;does anyone else wish undyeable part of piece of armour was dyeable?
---
yeh no shit
---
It's been awhile since I manually levelled up a character because I have a ton of tomes, but if you have HoT, I believe you can park your character at HoT metas like Auric Basin's octovine event and Dragon Stand's map meta while still getting a ton of exp (AB gives ~200, DS nets you ~1 mil). 
---
I'm not sure how downscaling of exp works though, so you'd probably get less than the aforementioned values (but I'd imagine it'd still a sizable chunk).
---
Hey guys.
---
If I want to play GW2 with good FPS and good graphics, if I remember well processor is more important than graphic card, am I wrong ?  
---
  
---
So I was wondering to invest on MSI GL73 8SE-018FR.  
---
I wanted to know if you had some advices, maybe some feedbacks from your own PC  specs ?  
---
As a note, I can buy only a desktop computer because I lack of space :-).  
---
Thanks in advance !
---
I think you have apply a new legal key if you already used the old one and  maybe contact support
---
hmm i'd like to ask for a code for

**Dragon Emblem Clothing Outfit**
---
 i know im late but of there's someone have spare and dont need it i appreciate it. if y want to sell also dm me Ty.
---
Your "rotation" from discretize or snowcrows won't work as well in fractals. I main Dragonhunter and have quite some experience running fractals.
---
If you look at bosses there are only few where you have 100% uptime (much like the Golem) and in both 100 &amp; 99CM you have several intermissions on top of heavy incoming CC so your "rotation" is nonexistant to begin with.
---
If you look into your logs from CMs you'll see downtimes quite clearly indicated, add to that a Boss breakbar (where you should burst) and you can't really pull of a sustain damage rotation without loosing tons of dps compared to stacking your dps cooldowns inside a bosses breakbar to gain +50% bonus.
---
As Dragonhunter vs. Bosses with breakbar and phases you usually want to start with Scepter/Focus and use Focus 4, Scepter 2, Spearthrow F1 and Focus 5 while running into the boss himself. Thats quite effective versus MAMA in 99CM so you can place Focus 2 on the ground and doublecheck when she starts to be actually actively hitable so you don't waste half your skills into her spawn animation.
---
While using those skills above and while wasting time you give those Warriors / other players in your group enough time to stunbreak the boss (you can do it yourself too with Ultimate Trap and Signet + Perfect Inscriptions), prepare your Greatsword 4 and 2, also your Utility Trap for phases like this - you have 5 seconds to burst!
---
If you manage to put your Spearthrow F1, Greatsword 4 &amp; 2 + Utility Trap inside a Bosses breakbar you have like 60k dps right there. It sure helps if your applied DoTs from Greatsword 5 and Focus 4 (also Focus 5 explosion) still tick while the boss is exposed.
---
If all your DDs know their shit Fractal bosses should usually be damaged enough to hit their first splitphase / whateverphase. MAMA has 3 phases at 75%, 50% and 25%, Ensolyss and Siax have two at 66% and 33%. Your dps drops to a fullstop right there since you're moving, allrdy moved or are CCing MAMAs Maids etc.
---
Fractals is about Bursting and abusing breakbars. After a bosses downphase where you can't apply any damage you usually should have all your offensive cooldowns ready again. Sometimes you can save your Traps and high damaging skills for Trashspawns and nuke them if they're a hassle and will apply to much groupwide damage.
---
Try to overlay your DPS-Windows, your Traps, DoTs, Greatsword 2 and Symbols are damaging over time - stack them into breakbars!
---
tl;dr: There is no sustain damage "rotation" only burst against Bosses where you have no 100% uptime.
---
my bank texts me after all transactions, I've only ever paid shelf price in the usa. maybe some states are different though.
---
So she's dead-dead but not really?
---
You're right that they're just concept, so allow me to rectify that.
---
My norn blood witch is pretty boring for a backstory, to be quite honest. She's a worshipper of the spirits, as per usual, reverence for Raven as is oft for knowledge seekers. She was taught by her mother and is carrying on tradition.
---
My sylvari is a pompous asshat that believes themself to be better than anyone else. Nothing to speak of really.
---
My charr though, that's a story.
---
Imus Underboot started life as most other charr. Birth, fahrar, warband. The lot. Imus, however, was a sadist to the extreme and when inflicting pain on his enemies wasn't enough, he turned on his warband and obliterated them.
---
As luck would have it though, he was heavily wounded in the fight and passed out from blood loss as he was attempting to clean his wounds in a body of water. He very nearly drowned and awoke a changed charr. 
---
Imus developed Dissociative Identity Disorder, with a new and much more friendly Imus in control, the sadist raging in the back of his mind, pouncing on any opportunity to regain control of what he believes to be rightfully him. The sadist isn't entirely wrong either.
---
While the new and friendly Imus isn't a stranger to the necromantic arts, he prefers to spend his time cooking, rather than picking fights with his new warband, Boot Warband. As such, he was given the name Underboot, because everyone else gets to step on him.
---
His food is good, but he never actually feels the need to eat himself, instead being almost entirely sustained by absorbing the life force of his warband, unbeknownst to all of them. Thus, his stomach is left mostly empty, meaning it's a good place to store bits and bone, for when you need a minion.
---
At the current time, the sadist has had control a grand total of 4 times. Each time, the warband has needed to find a new member. One of them has started to catch on though, so they'll probably need to find a new member again soon. Accidents happen, after all.
---
Ok will  try to fix the issue, thanks for the alert
---
Good player is good at the game, what a surprise.
---
Reddit is ignorant, salty and jealous, what a surprise.
---
When Glint seperated us to teach her about ascension, I'm sure she did similar thing to what Qui Gon tought Obi Wan at the end of episode III.
---
Which means she has become more powerful than we can possibly imagine.
---
They need to change that. The price the customer will see must always be the final price after everything has been added up.
---
Meanwhile I get the hummingbird while fishing for chaos skins... hey I'll trade ya :P
---
Its not true, you are mixing it up, im not talking about vat, im talking about a course
---
Dungeons, of course!  I forgot about those!
---
Probably. But reddit's markdown won't allow to format it properly. It's just too long.
---
You should check sites that share builds and guides on how to use them.
---
Stop supporting condescending and divisive raiders and streamers.
---
Legendary weapons are account bound, so you can swap them between characters.
---
Hm, or open 8 blc keys and get as the best drop, a  dye worth 3g. Its good too!
---
Great idea! They'll add it to PoF's version of the TM, called the Treasure Choya, it has a 1 in 17,000 chance of dropping the Invisible chestpeices just like the current invisible footwear, and an entire 2% of the community can enjoy it!
---
And if it sells it's obviously what players want and there's huge amount of people with shiny mount and glider skins.
---
Thank you, I'm having a blast :D Good luck to you too
---
Not in the US, they don't really agree with consumer protection over there.
---
Maybe she'll get...rezzed.
---
Thank you, yeah the hearts from level 20 onwards take a lot of time to complete, but finishing a whole zone and having that 6/6, 15/15 pop up is just too rewarding lol        
---
Just stumbled upon a rift event and it was hella fun
---
Hope and pray it's not noticed by the guy who's credit card was stolen to pay for it.
---
And jump.
---
More like, thousands of times larger when you compare ranked pvp playerbase to dota
---
OMG can I join your guild?
---
Actually not true. If anet didn't deliver first, players wouldn't be able to buy those items.
---
I have my shiny characters and my not so shiny characters.  I don't really think about "immersion," much anymore to be frank.  I care more about how different elite specs and classes play than I do whether someone's opted to be glitterforce sparkler #25.  I think the BL skins are a pretty tasteful balance all-in-all.  I don't really play much open world so the worst that I have to deal with a max size charr wielding Ad Infinitum or maybe legendary armor.  It doesn't really bother me that much.
---
Just roll with it you don’t have to participate
---
You are right, this is what a lot of players want but Anet is still at fault for breaking the world they built. The enviorentment/character customization/lore aren't link anymore because of this.
---
Besides facts that both builds have same base HP and strong burst, everything they have is different.
---
2 was worse for me personally
---
Legendaries is just a skin and Griffon is an awesome toy period. People that have it, consider it as an utility. They had forgot the joy of actually flying for the first weeks. Totally worth every cent.
---
Sometimes you just have to take risks. Sometimes they pay off (mentioned ones), sometimes they dont (side projects).
---
currency values fluctuate.
---
When Anet originally set those prices, the euro and dollar were closer together.
---
in the 6+ years since then, both those conversion rates have changed frequently.
---
your 1kn=5us=7.4e math just happens to be true *today*. 
---
and that has nothing to do with Anet.
---
Well if you refer to the play throughs lately from Arena Net then that is a part of the welcome back events and most of us already done those play throughs looooong time ago and there for not that many people watch. If you refer to twitch over all then GW2 never had that many viewers because not that many was streaming. It have changed a lot just this last year and many have been added. Most viewers outside of the "famous people" are new players playing through, former wow players do something, PvP, WvW and PvE raids. 
---
Playthroughs when a chapter comes out is also often giving more views. Right now SAB seem to be a thing too.
---
Is the game dying because of this, i can't see how that is relevant since what others already said GW2 was not that big of a twitch thing for the longest time and it is just lately it is turning which should indicate that the game is doing better rather then the other way around :)
---
&gt; I mean, their bodies are still reptilian
---
Kralk, Primordus and Jormag are definitely not reptilians.
---
You can't remove backpacks, auras and weapons with it.
---
After the trait nerf scepter is no longer a meta build, run the snowcrows axe build instead.
---
Oh I see, yeah that one is great!
---
That computer is pretty outdated at this point. You could really only get a new graphics card or some high speed DDR3 ram at this point to increase your FPS. A new GPU would help more depending the on the speed of your ram.   But the thing with GW2 and more and more games these days, is that they're becoming more reliant on CPUs more than GPUs (they're still important though).
---
If you want to save up some money you can buy a build like this (https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Jaded_Reaper/saved/#view=GZD4nQ). That build runs GW2 at 60 fps fine with pretty much max settings with medium character model limit. You will see drops during big meta events, but thats just because GW2 isnt that well optimized. For other games that build will run pretty much any game at 1080p/60fps on high-ultra settings. I run The Division 2 at high/ultra at 80-120 FPS.
---
I belive that you are forgetting that we have worst skins for mounts that electric horses, what about galaxy glowing gryphons?
---
&gt;I think GW2 is more reliant on your processor than your graphics card
---
Sure, but I mean his card still sux by today's standards, so it'd still help to upgrade that too. 
---
&gt;Ideally you want at least 16 gigs of Ram 
---
Which if he gets, he'll want a mobo upgrade too so he can get ddr4, at which point he may as well spend that extra bit of cash for a good CPU too.
---
It really depends on his budget though.
---
While it is more reliant on CPU, it does require a decent GPU as well. Your processor should be fine for now, but funny enough I actually had your processor back when I built my PC in 2010. It was a good one for back then, but right now it's shit tier. I would definitely get like an RX 570 or equivalent Ryzen. It's like a 150% increase in power compared to the 6900 series.
---
Nice
---
Honestly I have DDR3 until I build my new Gaming PC next summer. It's fine for what he needs assuming his budget isn't that big. Otherwise yes. New MOBO, DDR4 and new CPU maybe like 5th gen or higher i5. His GPU is lacking as well as I covered in another post. I had it back when I first built mine lol.

Fractal instabilities, slippery slope and birds, which had a ton of hate these past few weeks.

I swear I remember there used to be some way to defeat them way back when.  Did they remove the ability to thwack them mid-flight or such, or am I just dreaming that?

Just have tribulation cloud in every boss fight
---
[Single thread performance](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/singleThread.html) is the best benchmark I've found for GW2.
---
Your processor is about a 19/29, which isn't half-bad.  Your GPU might be the bottleneck, but if you drop graphics to minimum and still have low frames it's probably the CPU or RAM.
---
Slow salvaging and slow trading post. Both came with the same patch.
---
how?
---
&gt;This has changed how I view microtransactions and came to appreciate how other games as FFXIV and TESO have being able to keep their worlds from being corrupted by them.
---
&gt; FFXIV
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
LOL *Ohhhhh boy* you **do not** play FFXIV if you think they've managed to "keep their world from being corrupted" by wings and out-of-place things. Most of the clothing sets we get from the CN/KR versions of the game don't fit at all. The first thing that comes to mind is the Nezha set, which looks more like Kingdom Hearts clothing than anything from anywhere on Hydaelyn. This is even without mentioning the Angel/Devil sets that feature long ankle-length robes with large white/black wings on the back of them.
---
Some of the mounts in the Mog Station don't fit at all, either, and ...next month, I think(?) we're getting a four-person car (that can transform to fly and travel underwater) brought in from FFXV as a collaboration event. Cloud's motorcycle from Advent Children is in FFXIV.
---
Honestly, there's very little you can do if your sense of immersion is shattered by someone wearing some wings.
---
Yeah, they started adding a bunch of those after fractal 100
---
Pretty much need a full upgrade. Either the latest or last generation Intel i5 or Ryzen 5 or better. 16GB of ram, fastest speed you can get. Graphics card, well you might actually be able to stick with that one, CPU is what really matters in Guild Wars but if you need an upgrade. GTX 960/970 or 1050/1060 good options. AMD RX cards if you can find one at a good price.
---
My specs. AMD Ryzen 5 1600X, 16GB 3200Mhz RAM, EVGA GTX 1060 6GB SC. Max settings and 30FPS is my floor for basically all content in the game other than a few world bosses and metas where it will occasionally drop down to 25 for a few seconds. In my open world and story content FPS is from 45 all the way to 150+ on some maps. Averages a good 50-60FPS over most of the game.

Lineage 2 features fishing rods and lures of various tiers and special boosters which were speeding up fishing process (the basic game feature of spirit and soul shots adapted for fishing). Beside the fishes you could occasionally catch an enraged monster you had to kill. Caught fish could be opened which resulted in getting crafting materials and recipes or exchanged for further fishing related item.
---
Since we can swim without bothering for air in GW2, we could have also underwater fishing with nets or even setting up traps for crabs.
---
Monetization could include fishing rods, nets, traps and maybe even boats (since technology for swimming in one exists already - Sandswept Isles has this little boat that runs on "channel" between islands).
---
Fishing and fishes would definitely affect Chef crafting discipline - both could be included with one feature release in the future - Mike said they're going to rework Chef so food would be meaningful since very low levels.

No

I don't really see how are wings breaking your immersion in a world of big horned cat people, and giant frogs, and casting fireballs out of your hands, and weapons that look like surfboard made out of sky, and Kasmeer literally admits she goes everywhere naked and her clothes are illusionary.
---
Jackals made out of sand are canon, but astral ones are out of place
---
i really dont get the appeal of fishing in a mmorpg, usually i play those kinna games to do stuff that i cant in real life... finishing is like meh, i get that can be fun irl with a lot of friends and beer on a boat, but i really dont get why ppl like to simulate that on a screen....
---
Hello There, first of all, your GPU is super old, and has an ancient Architeture.
---
You just need 2 things!
---
16 RAM
---
and a new GPU. my recomendation buy an AMD RX 580 8GBDDR5 Edition! and your good to go.
---
They say it is heavy on cpu, yes it true but you need a good GPU to Render que Game the chars and all polygons and stuff, the cpu its not so important. 
---
I had a version of AMD Radeon HD 7870 its a good GPu but old Upgraded to RX 580 my FPS boosted Skyrocket.
---
All on max, and I still have my fx 8350 kicking it. its a crappy CPU, but gonna buy and Ryzen 7 my self. I dont need more cpu performance.
---
You just need more ram for the decicated RAM share with the system and stuff and a more new GPU! try looking for Nvidia GTX 1060 6 GB Edition or the RX 580! 
---
Glad to help!
---
If you enjoy it, sure. Compared to other farms (metas, bosses, gathering, etc) or fractals, raids, or even PvP probably not.
---
I despise those tiny, constantly flapping, half transparent dragon wings. This was the beginning of the visual shit fest that some players call "fashion".
---
since the switch to amazon servers my ping went from a stable 250 to a stable 300 +,along with normal lag came TP lag and a few months ago the TP got even worse.
---
PoF was 30 base price. 37 percent is 11 off, and the best discount thus far has been 50 percent, so 15 off. How much do you care about 4 bucks?
---
Electro-Whirl not working in the new mist arena since its introduction. Not only does it not reflect enemy projectiles, I had a friend stand on one of the OOC pillars and use ele staff projectiles on me, and it REFLECTS FRIENDLY PROJECTILES. 
---
Why is that even a thing?
---
Gem store items do not cost work or effort or time, so they should be toggle-able. Infusions are a slightly different matter but even more cancerous since they can directly affect my ability to see who I'm trying to fight in battle, and that is basically game-breaking. I don't know what Anet is waiting for because it really is time to be able to disable what has been a near complete forfeit of the original design mantra.
---
That's not what they said, though.
---
If you're on NA I'd be happy to show you around and give you some tips.
---
The glitch when you run funny like eith a twisted body when you carry a bundle as a charr sometimes
---
Yeah you want to cram Greatsword 5 4 2, Focus 5 4, Scepter 2 and both your Traps into those 8 seconds while you ware connected to the Boss with your F1 Spearthrow.
---
Your Main Burst comes most definitly from Greatsword and that [Utility Trap](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Procession_of_Blades) so you want to delay those skills until the breakbar of said Boss is gone.
---
Since Greatsword 5 and Focus 4 apply "DoTs" - I'd consider both a DoT based on power unlike normal conditions wich scale with conditiondamage, so you want to apply those first so they can damage for their dull duration and don't waste ticks into Boss phases where they go invulnerable.
---
So ideally you run into the Boss, while running into melee range you allrdy cast Scepter 2 (wich has a 5sec cooldown and can therefore be wasted to check if the Boss is active or not) and then use Focus 4. You most definitly **DON'T** want to use Focus 4 first, if you fail that because the Boss is immun you loose quite a bit of dps. After that you can consider stunning the Boss with Scepter 3, then its Time for your Spearthrow F1 to increase the damage of your following burst / CC from Ultimate Trap "Dragon's Maw" and your "Bane Signet" (+ Perfect Inscriptions), meanwhile your Scepter 2 might be ready again to use it and before changing Weapons use Focus 5 to save your actual Burst from Interrupts.
---
Thats all just perperation --
---
After changing Weapons you want to use Greatsword 5 either to stun the Boss again or for dps followed by your "Procession of Blades" Utility Trap + Greatsword 4 2 for max damage.
---
So you have all hard hitting skills within that 8 sec Spearthrow Window of yours wich increase your overall damage by 20%. Your Scepter 2 and Greatsword 4 will also push your overall dps by 10% and since you applied both your DoTs (Focus 4, Greatsword 5) before the Breakbar of the Boss is gone they also tick during the exposed debuff.
---
As Dragonhunter you just try to prepare and cram every damage source into those 5sec so you gain another 50% damage for free.
---
If your Group is good those Bosses usually don't stac active for long, most of them just start phasing into different mechanics by then.
---
Also its kinda important to stay on Boss to deal damage so I kinda like the "Stand your Ground" Stability shout since it also hits your entire raid with 5 stacks for 5sec. I also mostly use Focus 5 for defense to facetank mechanics while DPSing and not for that meme explosion at the end.
---
Bursting in fractals is highly dependant on your groups composition, if you used all your skills for CC and Boss is still not broken there is something wrong with your Teammates!
---
Guardians "Bane Signet" + Perfect Inscriptions should be one of the last CCs hitting the Boss before his exposure, so your 10sec Buff from Inscriptions is active on your entire group while you deal 50% more damage.
---
If your group is asleep and lacks CC you should call that out, fights just take longer and therefore lead to more fails etc.
---
DPS is highly dependant on the encounter, your group-composition, if the Boss focusses you or not, if your healer is shit ^(fuck Druids) *^(\*cough\*)* and subjection of different mechanics.
---
But you should at least allways pull upwards of 10k+ dps!
---
[You should get ARCdps yourself](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=ARCdps) to doublecheck!
---
Giggity.
---
As far as boons, go, the dominance of Druid + 2x Chronos has been finally broken. They're still both _playable_, for sure, but there are now legitimate reasons to run alternate comps. In raids, expect to see boon and heal Tempests, and even support _Scourges_ on occasion covering your heals and might uptime. On the Chrono side, you can replace them with a Renegade on 10-man Alacrity and up to 2 Firebrands for 5-man Quickness (with one FB potentially replaced by a Chrono for utility).
---
On the DPS side, there's been a few shifts, though nothing on the same level. Staff Weaver is toast, but alternate Weaver versions remain top of the scoreboard. There's a few odd changes, like power Soulbeast catching up to condi and Mirage being top-tier on many fights, but mostly it's just tweaks to which class happens to be on top this month.
---
I really don't think she's perma-gone. If she is, then that's that, but I'm too genre-savvy at this point. I don't see a point in speculating how, so I'll just wait until we get there.
---
