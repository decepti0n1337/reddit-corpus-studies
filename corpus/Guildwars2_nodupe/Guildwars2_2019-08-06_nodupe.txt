You can be smart and entertaining. You can even be smart, American and entertaining. Carl Sagan comes to mind.

Jesus Christ people. It's Greg Miller not Kanye West. They aren't paying top dollar for him and he's a perfectly fine host. He did well in the past covering GW2 and there's no reason to think this time will be any different.
---

---
Clearly ArenaNet are trying to generate more hype for Season 5 than any other season and presumably they have a reason for that. More hype for the game is only good for everyone at this point.
---
You're just looking for reasons to be pissy.

Hi! That's me! I'm stoked to be part of this. While I'm not a household name, I do have a lot of fans that love games, and there's nothing I love more than talking to passionate developers about their work. I'm excited to bring my audience, help get your questions answered, and talk to the team on stage!
---
Haaave ya met Anet?
---
Do F2P players get birthday gifts? Because you still have to pay for the game.
---
One of the BEST parts of the GW2 gem shop is.. you don't have to spend a single dollar to buy account upgrades (that aren't expansions of course)
---
Most PvE builds for most classes use Berserker's stats (power, precision, ferocity), while those that use primarily condition damage (burning, bleeding, poison, etc.) use Viper's (power, condition damage, precision, expertise a.k.a condition duration), although I've heard some more optimized/hardcore firebrand builds use a mix of Viper's and Grieving (basically Berserker's plus condition damage). Heal firebrands usually use Minstrel's or Harrier's gear (although Minstrel's loses a lot of damage compared to even Harrier's due to the lack of power).
---
However, in WvW, you might want more survivability. While more experienced players can use Berserker's and survive, you might want to try Marauder's (Berserker's, but with health/vitality), Minstrel's (for more support-focused builds), or something else with some vitality and/or toughness.
---
I'd say start with Berserker's, it's fairly cheap to get a full set of exotic zerker gear, and has probably the largest amount of builds that use it (pretty much any build that focuses mainly on power/normal damage). With that, you can figure out what kind of build to work towards and if you want a second set. Some stat sets require more work to get than just buying them or getting the crafting recipe from a crafting vendor, which is why I'd recommend starting with zerker gear as it's the easiest to get. Although for WvW, if you find yourself dying a lot, you could switch in at least a few pieces of something tankier, which shouldn't be too hard to find (iirc, you can buy soldier's or knight's or whichever one is power, vitality, and toughness from the vendors in WvW).
---
You can get an exotic set of Berserker's gear pretty cheaply from the Trading Post by clicking on the gear symbol next to the search bar, inputting the stats you want to search for (power, precision, ferocity in this case), the rarity (exotic), and the level range (probably 80-80, but you could expand the search to include lower levels if the level 80 stuff is too expensive for you). There's a set of named Berserker's heavy armor called Devona's, which should come up if you search using the above method, as well as some named and generic weapons. They're all usually around 50s-2g each. Anything else you can either use the above method with the stats you want, or search the wiki (type /wiki and then whatever you want to search into chat and it'll bring up that wiki page), plus you can check out sites like Metabattle (all kinds of builds), Snow Crows (mainly raid builds, but most also work for open world and fractals), or Burn Vabbi (WvW builds, mainly for zerg fights instead of roaming), among others.
---
I think for my top list it would have to be Ipos, Xiuquatl, Chuka. 
---
Ipos is hands dowm one of the best legendaries in the game. it looks amazing, even has an effect if you ride a mount with it and really feels legendary to me. Its also one of the few legendaries that you can easily slap onto most serious looking fashiom sets without it being totally out of place (whereas some other legies need more adjustments)
---
As a close second comes xiuquatl for me and this isnt necessarily because of the fairy wyvern but the scepter itself. The animation of it unfolding and the small rocks flying around is amazing. I really enjoy its effect colour scheme too and it never really gets too shiny or annoying. The wyvern is just a plus and while i think the wyvern could have atleast a few animations, its still a legendary worth the journey. 
---
Chuka is probably my most subjective pick. I think at this spot you could easily put nevermore astralia or hope too. All of the first collection based legendaries really looked up to par. Chuka became one of my favourite weapons tho as its red grey colour scheme gave me plenty of freedom to design sets that work with it. The collection also makes you feel a bond to the weapon itself as it harbors the souls of the ones you once hunted. The biggest downside for me is probably the projectile sound but outside of that i think all the animations are very fluid and legendary like. 
---
I'll also slap my bottom 3 on her just for funsies: 
---
The worst gen 2 legendary is for me the legendary longbow pharos or however its called. I can see the appeal  behind it for a dragonhunter but it just feels meh in so many aspects. Its just not up to par if you ask me and feels like a more flashy BLC skin (like the hydra staff with effects)
---
Second would probably be Verdarach. I totally get the appeal behind this legendary but it falls flat to me if i compare cost and value to Howl. I love the Howler as a legendary warhorn with its wolf howling sounds and think that verdarachs ghostly marching soldiers are just not what i am looking for in a legendary. Personal preference tho i guess.
---
And last but not least the worst gen 2 legendary is the legendary rifle HMS divinity for me. Again a legendary with a strange appeal that only a chosen few seem to like, but it has to compete with one of themost gorgous gen 1 legendaries the predator and it just falls flat. I can count the time i have seen this legendary be used with 2 fingers and not a single set actually seemed to fit it. Thouf you like it feel free to. And feel free to send me sets that fit it :)
---
Is anyone having random disconnects or black screens lately?  Getting constant network errors but unsure if it's my side or region
---
The Binding of Ipos is mine. Man I love that thing.

---
careful, jokes about quitting gw2 are heavily censored here
---
It really depends on what you want to do - for the vast majority of content you can play with a free account, any class will work absolutely fine. You should try a few out and see what you enjoy most!
---
If you were looking at the endgame PvE that a free account can play (Fractals), then warrior is the core class that you would have the easiest time finding groups with by far.
---
So this is sarcasm right?
---
I gotta say I love The Minstrel and Meteorlogicus. Of course I main fresh air ele so...
---
"Next Living World story arc" This is going to go over like a lead balloon if this is just more living story.
---
WoW's dueling is pretty iconic and people still use it to this day in many renown spots around Azeroth. Wish gw2 had something similar, it would literally Siphon players from WoW that like dueling. But Nah let's not make out community welcome to others and be a selfish one-sided toxic community that frowns upon others and what they like instead. I mean, it's not like Gw2 could use some more players or anything...It's not exactly sitting on top of the MMO player count.
---
I am genuinely excited for LS5. I believe it's a potential for GW2 to make an upward turn after the recent depression in our community.
---
Quip always puts a smile on my face
---
If we're going purely based on looks and such, I would agree with Binding of Ipos.
---
My favorite legendary including the process and story attached, was hands down Chuka &amp; Chumpawat. That's probably my favorite thing I've done in ~6 years of GW2.
---
I don't really believe in "best" classes or builds. While some excel over others, if they aren't played well or the player just doesn't groove well with it then other builds will pass you up. Beyond that, and in personal opinion, I find that Core Guardian and Core Warrior do well. Necro is pretty good as well (using minions\[PvE\] or Wells). Ranger gets better with elite specs (specifically Soul Beast from Path of Fire). Elementalist is okay in core. The traits work well together but their utility skills are more defensive and a lot of their dmg comes from specs. Mesmer (Power) is all right but isn't as accepted into groups without one of their elite specs. Engi can run core pretty well but Specs are better. Theif is pretty good on Core and better with specs. 
---
tl/dr: Warrior is easy to learn and offers group play. It's pretty easy to use and has lots of core ability.
---
close to 50/50 which is mixed, I'll take it as it shows an obvious concern for dueling in guild wars 2. Of course, people like you can create smurf accounts to downvote the post over and over and stop it from getting any more upvotes but that is beside the point.
---
Ex-IGN, I remember him being a big Metal Gear Solid fan. Always had good, upbeat energy from what I remember. Always been a big fan of his.
---
Please ask some hard hitting questions, I'm counting on you :).
---
Just a heads up, if it does somehow turn out that there's some reason you cant buy gems in-game on your account, if you're in the US, Best Buy is an authorized reseller and sells gem cards for the exact same price you'd be paying in game, so you'd still be able to get stuff from the gem store if you want to. Not sure about gem cards in other regions though.
---
As for support, the one time I needed support they got back to me in four business days, which was frustrating because there was a weekend in there so it took from a Wednesday to a Monday, but once a real person got back to me, my problem was fully resolved in just a few hours.
---
Astralaria, but none of my characters use axe at the moment, unfortunately.
---
I have to agree with everyone that is saying Chuka.
---
I'm just thinking from the perspective that he may get bored on the more basic classes and offering a few of the more complex classes.  I think if you're running around exploring then having a class with more gameplay variety will feel better than something that doesn't really change all that much.
---
&gt;Ah that makes sense. Good explanation, Probably should have mentioned where you were coming from in the post though. In my experience, many people who want to solo care more about surviving than interesting rotations.  Of course, that's just my experience.
---
Is it just me, or is this whole announcement seem to be set up to be disappointing? I remember when my whole guild and I were on Vent when the HoT announcement was made. We were stoked for it. They've already told us this is for the next LS chapter and it's being made on a weekday at 9 am. I mean, I'm like, you know people have jobs, right?
---
Very likely.
---
I hope we get a *sPiNgEr RaCe* next episoDeEEGAAAHHHHUUHHHHHHHHHUGGUIUGUGUGUGU
---
Que laughtrack.
---
The build I gave you requires no expansion. Even when playing alone the supportive abilities come in handy for yourself and you never know when you can encounter random players who are about to die and you save them with a big blinding leap with greatsword skill 3. For dungeons all you have to do is put up an lfg and wait a bit for it to fill up. 
---
I played this build during my entire second play through of the story from the second expansion.
---
Most of what u/reelgoodatspeling said is true, however, gw2 typically uses more CPU resources than graphics card. If you're looking to make a PC that runs most games well, prioritize GPU. For gw2, prioritize CPU.
---
Correct, the way the festival is designed you are throttled in your ability to collect the favors to unlock those skins.  Most of the skins are directly associated with the random unlock items from the black lion chests, so it is imperative to unlock what you can to boost the value of blc unlock items if you are into collecting everything.  Wooden Potatoes has put out the Guild Wars 2 Masters Challenge (check his YouTube, objective requirements is unlocking all armor and minis for example) that has got alot of hardcore players working on this.
---
I personally really like Marshal's + Seraph's mix. It makes for a really interesting hybrid support build, and allows you to use all of the Firebrand's kit to good potential. 
---
Harrier's is what I typically run, though, since it's the best for supporting in PvE.
---
In PvP, Mender's is the way to go, and Minstel's for WvW.
---
You can also play it as a DPS in PvE if you wanted, in which case Viper's is good. DPS Firebrand is much more boring, though, since you won't be able to make good use of most mantras and tomes.
---
does race or anything matter ik in some games u get race bonuses i want to be a charr cause they look cool to me
---
Still seems weird.  A live event for a living story episode?  Hopefully its huge now that the whole company is on board.
---
That comment section, dear lord Bruce allmighty.
---
&gt; I mean, I'm like, you know people have jobs, right
---
Just like those who are working at the event.
---
Imma lettu finish but Malyck has the best story arc of all time.
---
Not necessarily my favorite but the Moot is a bitchin mace. Very underrated imho.
---
Definitely do it if you need achievements, otherwise chuck into your bank for next year in case things change.  Achievements for the account bonuses (xp for spirit shards, karma, magic find, gold find) quickly adds up your longterm earnings in the later stages of the game when you are pushing out legendaries on a more frequent basis.
---
Or the weird taxi that gave off a ¬®I watch you have sex in the backseat vibe.¬®
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
you know you don't have to hate and degrade someone because they hold a different opinion than you
---
First off, are you using food and util?
---
Second, the difference between exotic and ascended actually is pretty significant in relevant DPS, because of the way armor is calculated IIRC. Effective increases in damage and power translate to much larger increases in damage output from what I've seen.
---
Completed. The first block of ‚óã ‚óã ‚óã ‚óã questions confused me. I'm unable to take and post a pic where I am. It was something about buying "permanent items to add to weapons" "temporary buffs" "items that increase dmg" yaddy yadda. I marked it all seldom as there's nothing on the gem store that matches, other than glyphs? Unless you just meant the trading post?
---
Really? What are you talking about. This game is all about cosmetics dude. WvW, PvP, Raids: all of these modes are already dead...
---
Arena Net don't care about gameplay and real content at all. It's already all about cosmetics and fashion. So there may be new race. Why not.
---
Or just use macros and use the cheap meld sets the super omnicrafters found out every patch
---
Agree on Ipos, I'm finally working on it myself but have always been super envious of it.
---
Doesn't sound to fun IMO
---
&gt; It just doesn't feel right for someone who has been supporting the game since 2005(OG GW).
---
It's been like this since 2005.  If you have really been supporting the franchise since 2005, you should have already known this.
---
Who?
---
[Dark Souls 1 intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpAqgIe05So).
---
Friendliest MMO Community, btw.
---
Well we know it's not an expansion now.
---
The longer duration does not necessarily mean it will be better.
---
Well, we've known that forever...
---
The bridge to console versions! /s
---
They hired Greg Miller to accounce S5.
---
Most likely paid to announce this "Living World" patch.
---
Same
---
I had a suspicion that you'd arrive if I tagged you. ;) Looking forward to the presentation!  Just, uh, leave the costume from Hardcore Tabletop at home?  There might be kids watching.
---
Well, no. However the op seems to be calling the length out specifically, which to me implies that they're placing some measure of quality on it.
---
The announcements will still be valid after work, just do you know.
---
We've been getting a new race every release, I don't know where you've been. \^\^\^\^\^/s
---
Sure. They will just waste more money (which we gave them) for some live events. Meantime there still won't be basics as content schedules and clear direction and real plans at all. Just some empty hype.
---
HMS Divinity.
---
Is this good? Or bad?
---
Ebonblade for me. Best bloody GS skin in the game.
---
*Teapot the lord of toxcicity* yep can't get any more true than after that "massive" debate.
---
NO PROMISES!
---
You people are literally never satisfied. Damned if do, damned if don't.
---
Or c) he finds a particular new fact more interesting than old facts he knew.
---
There's nothing all that deep to the statement in of itself.
---
Fake taxi ad best ad
---
The above comment is correct, except for the auto-attacking point which is, of course, nonsense.
---
&gt;meh it's not really open world pvp that I am asking for rather just a friendly duel invite option 
---
But that's *exactly* what the balance for the PvP in duels would use due to engine limitations; Open world.
---
&gt; a friendly duel invite option that people can choose to full ignore if they want too. Not talking about an open pvp server like WoW had
---
With how the social settings in this game already work, I'd rather not.  There's no settings to stop mails from coming through without just full on blocking the person which is excessive in some cases.  You have your options.  Guildhall arenas aren't all that exclusive.  Just join a guild that has one, invite your friend to the party, and jump to the guild hall.  They can port to the hall with you (if they have the WP, else they have to go to the entrance.)  Then you can fight all you want in the pvp arena.  If that's too much work for you, then IDK, man.
---
So by that logic all announcements are during working hours in the city in which the devs are, oh wait they aren't.
---
whatever they do, someone will complain...
---
LS1 was over too quick;  
---
LS2 moved was too slow;  
---
HoT was over-hyped;  
---
LS3 was too all over the place;  
---
PoF was under-hyped;  
---
LS4 was too much Desert;  
---
LS5 is already too much hyped;
---
type these in chat ( /wiki emote) ( /wiki event timer) book mark em broham
---
Well if this announcement is based around living story season 5 then it will show they haven't learned anything. Players want more than just same old same old.
---
Qauntity doesn't equal quality.
---
I never said that it did my guy, just that the op implied that they believed so.
---
Ask them about the future of challenging instanced content, specifically raids and cm fractals. Ask them if these are a priority and a tenative release cadence.
---
There is an LookForGroup tool, you will find people to play any content.
---
I fail to see how this is a bad thing.
---
&gt; Special events costs. And are time consuming 
---
So? Not my money, not my time. I'll tune in for the 45 minutes and if i find it interesting i'll be hype, if not, i'll be hype anyways because i like and enjoy the game.
---
Since Path of Fire I have only sporadically logged in for the living world episodes, finished those... and then just stopped again. I don't feel any need to log in, it feels like there's nothing to do that I haven't repeated already.
---
Nonrepeatable story content is the worst idea for an mmo that I've ever seen. It takes me three hours every three months to complete.
---
I'm waiting for a ranger scepter spec just so I can find an excuse to get Xiuquatl.
---
(Maybe something that's all about combat nature-magic - vines, ent summons, exploding pods, etc).
---
Your money doesn‚Äôt directly seed development. And unless you buy gems regularly and en-masse, I doubt you are actually supporting anything. 
---
The other things are issues but not because of one live event.
---
Because some people have no capacity for moderation it seems. They either have to be HYPE and set themselves up for disappointment by imagining a bunch of unrealistic stuff, or go in the other direction and always expect the worse and tear down anyone who gets excited.
---
Then no, none of that.  If you even bothered to try the arenas in guild halls, you'd understand that using PvE balance in PvP is broken and not worthwhile.  As of right now, there's no way for ANet to have the trait and skill balance change directly in a game map.
---
This also has been suggested countless times before.  This is why custom arenas became a thing.  This is why there's an arena in Edge of the Mists.  This is also why Guild Hall arenas are a thing.  And lastly, this is why there's a PvP area in Sun's Refuge.  I believe if ANet had any intention of adding exactly what you want, the right-click-duel option, they would have done so already.
---
People are just jaded bastards. You wanna be hyped about something, go ahead and be hyped. No harm in that. Just make sure you know what you're actually being hyped about, and that you're not *over*hyped.
---
My name is Greg Miller. I worked for IGN for 8 years, mainly covering PlayStation but eventually becoming a video host. In 2015, three friends and I broke away and founded Kinda Funny, a youtube/podcast company focused on games and pop culture. I won the Trending Gamer Award at the Game Awards in 2015. I host a lot of events now on top of talking about games daily. 
---
TLDR: I‚Äôm a fat guy who talks about video games on the Internet.
---
Tbf we're still concerned...
---
Who are you??? If not a developer then please stop bluntly telling me things like "NO, NONE OF THAT" it has no power as you are a consumer just the same as me. This post was not made directly at you, I am glad you have an opinion, but it holds no weight to me as I am looking for developer responses, not community ones.   
---
I have done my research and am well aware of the restricted dueling this game has, it's ridiculous. now fuck off, please.
---
&gt; I don't see a difference
---
well then it probably ISN'T working, no....?
---
they aren't gen2
---
The atmosphere will be nonexistent  
---
The music, look of the enviroment, and the mobs are what made the jade sea and echovald  
---
A GW2 version of each would both use the same 5 mobs everywhere, have mediocre music (new people Anet brought on are very inconsistent) and any level beauty will be instantly ruined by visual diarrhea meta events that also clog up your UI with pester messages
---
Xiuqatl. I like Verdarach but i still have trouble accepting its size.
---
Dude, you obviously  have no clue what you are talking about and how these things work. Just stop. And about your last words: fuck you too.
---
Spring Rolls are a Lunar New Year festival item, the event is around January/February. I can‚Äôt see where this is insider trading for the announcement. More like speculation or preparation for the next Lunar New Year
---
Some tp baron with too much gold trying to manipulate the market. Nothing to see here. Move along.
---
Ask anet about the future of wvw
---
TBH, I'm not that big of a fan of any Legendary; or at least, I'd generally prefer non-Legendary skins over Legendary skins. But Binding of Ipos looks really nice... The only character I'd use it on is my Necro, which rarely uses Focus, so doubt I'll make it. My second pick would probably be Exordium since its colors grew on me and its unique animation make it pretty versatile.
---
Ho-oh
---
/u/McLeoud  Not sure if this is possible to add at a later time, but a way to remove all upgrades in a section (weapons, armor, or trinkets) instead of wiping out an entire section of armor or trinkets including their upgrades.  The only other way currently is to remove upgrades from each piece.
---
The only legendary that I care for is The Flameseeker Prophecies. I love shields, I love its look and I love its connection to the lore.
---
I'll still never get it though, because I simply can not justify the grind.
---
I just honestly don't think it could be put in without being full of annoying bullshit.  Hell, PvP itself isn't free of its annoying bullshit and balance is split between PvE and PvP.  If ANet can somehow make dueling work, maybe via build templates or using your PvP build set up in PvE, I'm all for it.  If it's just like the garbage that happens in the guild hall arenas, no thanks.  Unless they somehow make it possible for me to auto-deny duel invites from non-mutual contacts, I'd rather not have random interrupt mesmer or permastealth cheese thief #23048068 duel request me for the thousandth time while I'm chatting with friends, crafting, exploring, or getting ready for a raid/fractal.
---
 just hungry
---
Nothing ever lives up to the hype because people always go waaaay overboard
---
You know fans of the game are in different timezones, right?
---
Wait you didn't mentioned the WvW haha
---
Why not fly out Woodenpotatoes or MightyTeapot?
---
works fine together. here is the explanation for the right naming: https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/wiki/Using-with-other-addons-and-overlays
---
&gt; LS1 didn't kill the game. Maybe some people disliked it, and surely it had its flaws, but it wasn't that bad.
---
I strongly agree with the overall sentiment regarding the trend of hyperbole and petulance in this and other gaming communities, particularly as of late. 
---
But with that said, while LS1 certainly didn't *kill* the game, it definitely was "that bad". ArenaNet's decision to completely abandon the "Living" release scheme speaks volumes as to what LS1's impact was with regards to player engagement and retention.
---
Pharus, followed by Astralaria
---
The only thing I don't like about it is that mainhand footfalls take priority over offhand
---
:(
---
Getting hyped is part of the enjoyment of a game. Even if you end up feeling disappointed, at least you enjoyed the lead up to the reveal or release.
---
This Reddit is a cesspool of negativity and complainers. Just ignore it and play the game. There's useful information here but everything else is a disease that attempts to infect you with melancholy and dread.
---
What a great contribution. This is exactly what I would expect from OP , considering their attitude in other posts. All OP wants is an agreeing echo chamber , not counter-points in any way.
---
this description sounds like an alternate universe Jim Sterling &gt;.&gt;
---
But will Xavier Woods be there?
---
I really like Pharus, but since I never play Ranger and mostly play Guardian I probably will never craft it, which is a shame because I think it looks perfect for a DH.
---
He revealed what he could reveal, and we all know "the new story arc" is coming (since August 2018). I doubt he would be authorized to just reveal: OH GUYS I WILL HOST SURPISING EXPANSION EVENT! 
---
Obviously he had to keep it vague.
---
i have musicbox installed, but no ahk script works properly since this patch, all music just falls out fast with no sleep pauses at all.
---
Well I won't argue with you about it. I think it is something we can see added to the game in time.
---
Counter all you want bud many people have spoken have said they want duels as well, its a common concern at this point.

Just got word from /u/that_shaman that unfortunately it's not possible to get those files as they are all encrypted.
---
Under 'known issues' [here](https://github.com/kytulendu/Gw2Browser) it's stated as well (I was just hopeful that it was 'some' rather than 'most').
---
The cow or bull or whatever it was..
---
that just sits on your face.
---
yes its insider trading, yes i bought them all, yes they will be used in new best meta food in the incoming expansion for BiS underwater food combined with potatoes, sawgill mushrooms and cauliflowers using cooking 500
---
And the floodgates have opened...
---
I'm running Arc and Pixy, but no reshade. Easy to setup.
---
I think that depends on the payment method, with paypal sure with the others no idea

---
Yes I set it to use my graphics card and I set it to "high performance" :/
---
Do you have the problem only with gw2?
---
They have a right to think whatever they want, your the one being toxic here now
---
well I am not upset about that.  You're the one who seems to be looking for a reason to be upset.  I know how this goes, by the way.  stop spamming me with replies you don't even actually care about.
---
M3m3 2 l33t 4u
---
Maybe I am just spoiled then. I wish I could just buy everything.
---
I have been feeling this way since early season 3, when they switched to pumping out gemstore garbage every week, from 2-3 weeks.
---
I have not tested my CPU under load. However when running the game my CPU does not even get high.  My RAM was high before I upgraded to a higher memory. 
---
All games on this computer run horribly. League of Legends plays just as bad as GW2. 
---
I have direct X12 installed. The only third party addons  I have installed is  d912pxy (because I thought it would run better)
---
How would I check if any command line arguments are being used?? I don't think there is any. I just completely uninstalled and reinstalled GW2 64 bit.
---
nope league of legends runs just as bad the last time I tried :/
---
Sure, if stating that encouraging abusive behaviour towards people just doing their jobs is toxic, and creating a hostile atmosphere is toxic, sure I guess I am being toxic. 
---
But as you state, I have a right to think whatever I want.
---
I mean it is literally the way the game survives.  Expansions serve as a boost in profits which can benefit the game allowing companies to hire more people to get more objectives completed.   Gemstore releases just keep that money steadily flowing (as big or as little as it gives depending on game's population of course).
---
I downloaded HWInfo. Would the temperature show on sensors and my cpu temp would be under ‚Äúcpu package‚Äù?
---
Indeed, releasing the first expansion was the first time an announcement ever lived up to its hype with Guild Wars.
---
There's really no excuse for it but of course reading replies here people will don their shiny armor and defend Anet's lack of effort as per usual.
---
Wish they'd just retcon the entire Scarlet cringefest and put LA back to how it was.
---
So yea, you can check "sensors-only" at start and then look for CPU package and GPU. I am at work so i can cross check with my private machine.
---
Verdarach. Really like its sound : "tooooooooooooo". And its insane proportions. The switch animation is a little to much, but sometimes it make opponents in WvW to waste an evade because they think this is the ice sigil animation.
---
"tooooooooooooooooo". :)
---
Dump quest but..do you have a cooling fan for your cpu and heat paste between cpu and fan?
---
We should check and post proof!
---
I just downloaded hw info and under ‚Äúcpu package‚Äù it looks like my cpu temp is 88-90 degrees Celsius while playing. I‚Äôm starting to think this may be the problem......
---
I know I have cooling but I‚Äôm starting to think I may not have enough. Would the solution be to get a better cooling system for my cpu??
---
Is 88-90 degrees on idle, full load or when you're playing the game? In any case, that's quite high for cpu temps. Looks like you may have a hardware problem. How old is your pc? Is your cpu cooler working as intended? Have you tried cleaning your pc and re-applying thermal paste?
---
Gpu temps seem fine depending on the model but 45 degrees is not alarming at all.
---
"Gemstore releases just keep that money steadily flowing" which requires (as you stated) an active player base. Updates alone just don't get me all that excited anymore so the only time they see money from me is well if they ls is really good or they announce an xpack. I'm sure I'm not alone with this behavior. Despite that, I rarely see any news articles about gw2 except if anet messes up for the 100th time. Xpacks are at least newsworthy.
---
Well, maybe... https://youtu.be/x3rSMOcY-48
---
Why are you all downvoting this guy for liking the video?
---
I spent my 2k hours of gameplay fully muted. get on muh level
---
F2P is the entire base game but with restrictions. A Path of Fire CD Key, PoF+HoT CD Key, or Heart of Thorns CD Key will remove the restrictions. Alternatively during certain occasional events ANet distributes a Guild Wars 2 heroic edition CD Key, which can remove the restrictions on a F2P account but doesnt allow access to expansion content.
---
1 hour? For a 45 minute reveal?
---
I think you mean 10 hours.
---
I run a combination of Plaguedoctor (Vitality, Condi, Heal, boon duration) and Minstrel with Balthazar runes. Plaguedoctor for the armor and weapons, with Minstrel for all except two of the trinkets which are settler stats.
---
(Listing from memory here so the numbers might not be 100% accurate)
---
Weapons: Axe + Torch and Staff. (Sigil of concentration on axe, smoldering on both sets, cleansing on staff.)
---
Skills: All Mantras except for Purging Flames.
---
Retribution: Top Middle top
---
Honor: Middle Top Bottom
---
Firebrand: Middle Top Bottom
---
This build gives a really nice spread of stats. 24K HP, 2800 armor, 900 CD, 900 Heal, 90% Burn duration and 50% Boon duration. Meaning you can still do decent damage while supporting.
---
It's not a build that specializes in anything but it is a really good Jack of all trades.
---
I run it in WVW but I can imagine it working in PvE as long as high toughness isn't a problem.
---
We all hope.
---
One tomb in hinterlands mentions something like "His death surprised everyone, starting by his scamer of a doctor"
---
If he didn't clean his pc since when he bought it that's totally the problem.
---
In before we find out you built this PC and didn't use heat paste under the cpu
---
i've seen people state that elite specs are "confirmed" based on one of shaman's tweets, stating that leggy runes have room for a few more sets, and fueled by their hype. at the best of times, hype morphs your own expectations. at the worst it sparks utterly unrealistic rumours.
---
be excited for the announcement, but don't let that blind you. anet's hype train track record isn't something proud of, and it's on them to deliver something that is worthwhile.
---
Is that a desktop computer? If yes, then in order check these three points:
---
1. Do you have case fans? And enough? For example for my Corsair 400Q I use only 3 fans, 2 at the front blow air in at the front, and the gfx card, the power supply and 1 extra fan blow air out at the back.
---
2. Do you have sufficient air being pulled **from** the case? Some people add tons of fans but have them all push air in, which creates pockets of "stuck" air. It's far more important to suck air from the case and let new air come in on its own, or (like I said under (1)) have an intentionally created front-to-back or bottom-to-top flow.
---
3. Is the CPU fan the stock fan or a way underspecced one? Assuming the case is sufficiently ventilated, it might be worth investing into a bigger CPU fan.
---
Oh, and something I just remembered: Check the thermal grease/pad. I had an AMD overheat from the grease having shifted a bit during re-assembly and not making good contact.
---
The announcement is pretty much timed so you can go watch it and then you can go to PAX that happens in Seattle from later that day to whole weekend just few blocks away.
---
This may sound like a stupid question, but I know 2 guys that were doing this... Is your monitor plugged to the Radeon GPU or is it connected to the motherboard GPU?
---
They even reintroduced recycled old content to milk it even more

what this guy said.. resonates the with the majority. including myself. i hope they'd show a gw2 road map too.
---
Thank you. The survey is not GW2 specific, but generalized for all MMO. Those kind of items are often found in those pay-to-win F2P MMO, so if you never played them you might not be familiar with them.
---
Yes it can, tho requires bit of tinkering if not familiar with coding. There is also some importjson Google sheets script out there which you could just plug into the sheet and then use it in a cell to get the whole inventories (with api url) into a helper sheet and then use vlookup/hlookup to get the actual current amounts. It automatically updates hourly I think? But can force it to update whenever. This option is more messy but requires next to no knowledge of coding.
---
Meanwhile Xiuquatl snake does not cooperate.
---
Yeah, their days of creating shitty temporary content with pathetic gameplay value that actively removed content from the game and still has its negative effects for new players are over.
---
I loved your work in IGN and your persona in the Gauntlet at Roosterteeth!
---
Thank you!
---
To me there's a lot of stuff I actually want to repeat but am actively discouraged from repeating (CM raids, challenging achievements, etc.), which in combination with the content I don't want to repeat more than once being most of what's released (non CM fractals with shitty random instabilities, story chapters, metas with a total lack of non rng unique rewards) I don't find myself playing often either anymore.
---
Like I said, it could very easily criticized the casual nature of Guild Wars 2 without contributing to the toxicity.
---
They said they tried but had issues with it
---
Pants in Fire.
---
When tf will this be fixed, this is super annoying!
---
If I transmute a weapon or armour, then transmute it again (or revert it to its original look), does transmuting it *again* to the first thing I transmuted it into cost another charge? E.G.:  
---
Transmute base weapon to Luminous skin.  
---
Transmute Luminous weapon to Equinox skin.  
---
Does this weapon, which has now had Luminous applied to it before, still cost a charge to swap back to Luminous?  
---
I ask 'cause I see the base skin of an item and my heritage skins are free to swap to any time but I don't want to swap off my fancier skins if it's going to cost me a charge just to swap back again to a skin I already paid a transmutation charge for once before.
---
Well, this is not very complicated - marked for TODO
---
it should be noted that the site "cdkeys.com" is not an [official retailer](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers/) so don't get confused with that. Also the game is expected to go on sale this month with the current anniversary event going on.

It is nothing wrong with hype at all infact it is a good thing. But looking at the history people tend to overhype to a point that no matter what they will come out with people are so hyped they will get disapointed because nothing can stand up to their hype. And that is what people tell others to not do, because overhype is not a good thing
---
Stop RPing in PvP, not using built-in game mechanics that are there for your benefit and your teams benefits is really stupid.
---
well,if you gona watch SC speedrun of  100CM you will notice that their RENE had about 5k dps whole time =)
---
Excitement, sure that's all well and dandy. But in video-gaming being hyped up for new games or expansions etc. there's a good chance that things fall flat in the end. 
---
Keep in mind that they've also had several team members axed recently, so I don't expect like massive things such as new dungeons, new game modes or systems etc.

As an aside, are you deleting your comments? They still show up in your history, which suggests you aren't, but if they were being removed by something like the AutoMod, they should be saying [removed].

Open up your case. Check if the fan is still spinning onto the CPU heatsink. I'd do a re-seat of the Heatstink on the CPU with new thermal paste. Thermal paste smooth's out the surface and makes sure the heat is distributed from the CPU to the heatsink to dissipate.  
---
Your CPU is getting hot to a point where it will thermal throttle. This is a protection to make sure it doesn't fry itself and it throws down the voltage significantly and the frequency of the CPU as well resulting in your terrible gaming experience.  
---
That CPU needs a beefy cooler. If you have the stock cooler, i highly suggest picking up an aftermarket one.
---

---
chargebacks are irreversible once initiated. eventually you will get your money, and if patient you might get your gems purchase refunded. you did after all redeem/spend the gems.
---
even though you didnt intend it this way, your actions mirror activities by actual fraudsters. they will purchase the game, get gems and buy ingame stuff, sell the stuff for real money offsite and then chargeback their account. this activity gets banned straight away.
---
&gt; and request for it to be escalated.
---
And escalation will result in even longer waiting times.
---
You are correct. I should clarify. There are multiple likes and dislikes out of an MMO and everyone should play the way they like. For those that do not care about story they should definitely skip it.
---
The group I was meaning to point out are the ones that discuss which expansion to buy, skip to endgame, and then complain there is nothing to do. GW2 offers much to play, for certain types of MMO players.
---
If Mordremoth can attack the Mother tree in the Grove... it can attack anywhere!
---
Don't make it a grind.
---
Play content you enjoy and the gold just accumulates, just make sure not to waste it on other stuff.
---
Hmm I wonder why I feel the sudden urge to follow MMOINKS on Twitter...
---
None.
---
Now you just get downvoted to oblivion for criticizing toxicity from people who say they don't want to play the game any more, yet try to call you toxic when you suggest that perhaps they should move on instead of making it toxic for players who do.
---
Have you considered creating your own sub instead of brigading this one?
---
I already stopped playing now I'm just waiting the news to see if I delete the game or not.
---
The Wiki has the complete list of armour and skins
---
The game is trash.
---
It hasn't changed, but getting a second set is easier than getting your first set. It sounds like you're comfortable doing content that you'd want top-level gear for (i.e. raids and T4 fractals), where you can pick up ascended gear as drops or with their respective currencies. I'd double check since TP prices fluctuate, but crafting grandmaster marks and trading them in is almost certainly cheaper than 100% crafting the equipment if you were considering going that route.
---
Stat-swapping your armor and weapons is a lot cheaper than crafting a new set if you're really set on not playing a power build, but I'd advise against it to be honest. Spirit shards shouldn't be that much of a problem, use food and exp boosters while you play and do dailies for an extra three. As someone else mentioned you can trade tomes of experience for shards too. If you don't have it yet, do the Caladbolg Reforged quest for the ascended weapon if that helps. Even if you have done it once, you can get a new one for each character.
---
For trinkets, doing LWS3 &amp; 4 map currency runs like winterberries is probably your best bet. Winterberries from Bitterfrost Frontier is the easiest and gives you the most options, but do whichever you prefer. Unfortunately, condi is a little harder than power since the fractal trinkets cost more than 10 pristene relics each, but the Mist Band, Pendant and Talisman is still an (albeit expensive) option. It depends on how long you play each day, but this'll take you a few days, maybe a week if this a priority.
---
Getting a full set of the best equipment isn't an overnight job, but I also don't think it'll take as long for you as you're worried it will be.
---
[removed]
---
I did, partly because they edited the comment adding a bunch of more obvious sarcasm after my reply
---
A chargeback is supposed to be the nuclear option when nothing else works, and you went straight for it before trying anything else? You shouldn't use them so lightly if you want to stay on good terms with a company. Chargebacks cost them money and send a message that you're done trying to work things out like a reasonable adult. Have some patience, ask for the ticket to be escalated and actually cooperate with them this time
---
That CPU doesn‚Äôt have a GPU so it can‚Äôt be.
---

---
Shooooooshadooooooo
---
And on the flip side we have a number of people, that don't seem to play the game much, going on streams and stating that there is a "2%" chance of elite specs.
---
It is so tiring when you have unbridled hype on one side and complete negativity for the sake of being negative on the other. I agree fully with your comment of not being blinded - either in terms of unrealistic expectations or falling into a spiral of seeing nothing good.
---
Just know that we are getting something and look forward to the announcement itself, not what it might hold.
---
Beautiful, thank you for the update! And great job! :D
---
Looks cool with the privateer scepter too. Harry Potter wand
---
If you‚Äôre running at 88-90 on that Processor with GW2 in the background I‚Äôm quite surprised the system hasn‚Äôt started to shut down automatically to protect itself whilst you‚Äôre actually playing the game.
---
The 3960x itself is an old processor now being almost 8 years old, its older than GW2 itself even. It should be fine for the title, but thats something to take into consideration. The rest of your build is fine.
---
You need to check the cooler ensure its actually working. If the cooler is eight years old it might need replacing. If that can get the temps down then everything should run much more stable, but GW2 is a very CPU bound game (and not the best threaded) and that processor will only go so far.
---
I've criticised aspects of the game for years on this sub and the official forums and this idea of getting downvoted into oblivion is outright untrue.
---
I'll edit in an example shortly due to being on mobile. 
---
Posts that criticise but do so constructively have always been welcome here. What has been getting downvoted is outright vitriolic negativity and that's the only boil that's been an issue in the community for a while, primarily stemming from streamers and content commentators.
---
What's happening now is you get downvoted by people that haven't cared about this sub in a while should you speak out about the negative atmosphere fostered by particular people that have a higher standing in the community. And forbid if you make fun of them, they are only allowed to make fun of people.
---
We don't have access to any of that information, contact support if you want to find out.

Anet have a tendency to suspend accounts after a chargeback. I‚Äôd advise sending Support an email to explain the situation before they do anything
---
&gt; Edit: Did the chargeback go through or not?
---
He payed via Paypal. If you do a chargeback on Paypal, Paypal first passing it to the seller to give both partys the option to clear the situation on their own. 
---
In this case Paypal gave the chargeback request to Anet, while Anet already sent the mail with the code. So they closed his account and flagged him as a fraud mail.
---
Message support about that! They can ban you for that particular incident. Better you let them know that your bank made the mistake or your payment didnt get completely through
---
Their policy is that with few exceptions, gem purchases are final. If you bought gems and used them, they‚Äôre going to want their money or they‚Äôll ban you for doing a chargeback.
---
This is fake! It doesnt even begin to mention Sawgil Mushrooms!

---
The sad thing is, it isn't even an echo chamber of reasoned criticism that the streamer and content commentating side of the community are fostering. It is one of outright negativity and hatred.
---
It's killing both positive threads and those that were critical and well argued because posts just get flooded quickly to propagate the mentality that streamers who are planning to move to other games want to propagate.
---
Contact support to get ahead of it.  If your bank issues a charge back for any reason it can affect your account‚Äôs standing.
---
I understan that you feel that qT was a loss for you. But nothing is ever static. You will loose people eventually. Such is life. 
---
Look i am not trying to tell you that GW2 have no issues. I am a WvW player so i knew about this issues long before they even reached PvE. But you choose how to deal with it. And talking about it in the forum is a good thing. Overflowing the forums with deadgame posts downvoting every other post from players who just joined and are happy telling about heir first day in game, is shitty behaviour and something that tells me they should have left the games and the forums long time ago. 
---
I have left games. Some because they simply died out and closed. Some because the game went in the wrong direction. It took a while to get to the point were i felt no i can not do this anymore, but when i did, i left. I did not stay in the forums trying to tell others they should too. Each person should take their own decission about it. Hording through the forums trying to bring more players with you and spewing out shit in new players experience is not really healthy behaviour. Do you get what i am trying to say?
---
Wait there are ppl who play gw without reshade !? How do you even do that? I would get visual cancer from vanilla gw within like 5min
---
There is a lot of questions I could ask but I will ask one that I believe is the best.
---
What is happening with guilds? The existing guild missions are incredibly old and have been not only powercreeped but they are also very boring at this point. Is there plans to revamp or add in new guild missions into the game to give guilds something to do together?
---
How you check this?
---
To add to this list, balance; why is it that certain classes have always enjoyed being meta builds in all areas of the game while others flounder all under the guise of some thematic rational. This is most prevalent in areas like WvW and PvP and raiding. Every other major game knows you cannot balance all classes which is why they tend to rotate meta classes over time so each has its day in the sun, with GW2 it has pretty much always been the same classes at the top of DPS over time.
---
I'm genuinely interested in people who post these sorts of posts and what answers they are hoping to get. I'm not trying to be rude or anything but why are peoples first instincts to come on reddit and ask surely your first instinct should be to ask Anet support because the reddit can't do anything.
---
For sure, just wanted to know if he also played the best class in the game ;D
---
From all I can read here, you really didnt think about what you were doing before calling out Anet.. 
---
I guess its always easier to point fingers at something else besides your own stupidity
---
Can you have the snake and the book out at the same time?

&gt; I've actually been considering that someone should create another sub for positive, constructive, polite commentary. It seems like only small subreddit can survive Reddit toxicity nowadays anyway. But I'm not kidding myself: people would brigade the hell out of that, too, so it would require heavy investment in terms of moderators.
---
that is an entirely different horse, balance is all well and good to criticise, most of the community don't get upset at all when you do that but they absolutely do get upset if you criticise the lack of attention anything other than open world PvE is getting. 
---
&gt;Posts that criticise but do so constructively have always been welcome here. What has been getting downvoted is outright vitriolic negativity and that's the only boil that's been an issue in the community for a while, primarily stemming from streamers and content commentators.
---
that is not what has been happening, people have been downvoting well reasoned arguments simply because they disagreed with them or didn't like them, the streamer i assume you are mentioning (teapot) didn't even behave badly, iirc he said something along the lines of gw2 was still a good game, it just wasn't for him anymore because of the neglect that hardcore content has been receiving.

---
i've seen many posts that have been making fun of content creators, including one of yours that got deleted, just because they hold a different opinion than you do. the negative atmosphere is a result of anets mismanagement, you can't just screw over half your playerbase for years and expect them to be happy about it, especially when the other half of the playerbase keeps saying "just leave lol, not your game"

Hello, thank you very much for your feedback!
---
I'd suggest binding about face to an easy to press key gets some getting used to but it helps a lot with mind games, movement, and such, as well as tab targeting although fighting things like a Mesmer proves to be alittle more difficult, It does make it easy sometimes. And learning to cancel some abilities may be beneficial especially depending on the class and the way that the ability plays such as rangers longbow 2. Holding down the right mouse button should be default to disappear the cursor you may need to turn your camera speed and sensitivity up on your mouse if you want to do camera flicks and such like that.
---
&gt;I bought gems for real money 5 days ago, converted gems-&gt;gold and made items for legendary weapon(and made leg too). 
---
Disgusting.
---
Launchbuddy?
---
Basically what it says, don't interupt your AA's.
---
Now to clarify let's take Power Dragon Hunter build.
---
In the first Greatsword Rotation:
---
LoF
---
Binding Blade
---
PoB
---
SoJ
---
SoW
---
Whirling Wrath
---
3x AA chain, if you look at the autoattack from Greatsword you'll see the first time it does Strike, the second time Vengeful Strike and the last attack in the chain is Wrathful Strike which does the most damage of the three. If you interupt let's say on Vengeful Strike the next time the chain starts from Strike again so you miss out the Wrathful strike damage.
---
Now the big question is, is it important for you. 
---
Yes and no.
---
No if you're not doing the entire rotation right in the first place, since you won't ever reach the benchmark anyway.
---
Yes if you're already doing most of the rotation right, you may get somewhat close to the benchmark if your build is exactly right and all boons &amp; stuff are there. But you still won't reach the benchmark because you're missing out on that AA chain damage.
---
But OP specifically said he's doing casual content.  So presumably no raids, and only lower level fractals, where celestial will do just fine.
---
Somebody please Photoshop a horrific aura effect in there.
---
No, he specifically asked for a single set, for casual use.  Celestial is that.
---
Just go back
---
Or you can use the Arena inside a Guildhall. But if you really want to practice for PvP /WvW I'd go for duels inside those modes because the are some balance adjustments. For PvP you can look for a duelling custom arena or even open your own arena (some gold needed). For WvW you can use the duelling spot north of the southern camp (green or blue map), but if you want to duel your friends that way, they need to be on a server you are matched with this week. Other WvW option would be Edge of the Mists, here your friend still need to be on an other server but there is no need to be in the same match, you only need to be in teams with different colors.
---
It's possible but unlikely. They have considered it in the past, but said it would be more beneficial for them to make a new class, hence we got revenant.
---
Now we have all classes filled out maybe it is "on the table again", but I doubt if it is worth the Dev time for them or really possible considering its implementation.
---
Except it‚Äôs the hardcore players who are quitting. Please have reading comprehension before you reply to posts instead of making s huge ass out of yourself, thanks.

One suggestions includes to look at the character, one is to listen.

Might sound dumb but there's an option that can be easily overlooked that helps alot in general, but mostly I find, with ranged attacks. Its called "Stop attacking on target change" you'd want to disable that. I played far too long with that option on...
---
It was totally about the game looking nice. It was an attempt to broker some sort of common ground and get past all the salt, as the poster noted.
---
However, people that are on the more rage induced side of things don't see that. They see it as an attempt at drama (it isn't) and then try to get anything positive removed.
---
And you've gone ahead and outlined another issue with this streamer baited negativity. You move the goal posts - constantly. You have no coherent argument and if people happen to point out things that dispel the viewpoint you want to enter into the argument with, you dismiss it rather than reconsider things. 
---
Case in point - your response. Instead of noting that you were wrong and criticism is allowed, you shift your goal posts to make it about WvW, PvP and, I quote this directly from you, "end game PvE". I'm going to make this point quite clear because if you had read the critical post I made years ago, and linked here, you would see it was about endgame PvE! It also directly contradicts the notion that the sub doesn't embrace criticism. It absolutely does when it isn't laced with Fuck Anet rhetoric and that seems like a pretty reasonable situation to be honest. 
---
This is why it feels like a brick wall discussing things with certain elements of the community that want to defend the streamer-promoted point of view. Your opinions morph and change, you have no coherent arguments and you'll twist them, no matter what evidence you are provided with, to make it seem like your narrative is still the only correct and valid one. It isn't.
---
However I'm glad you've picked up the fact that the release cadence between raids isn't 4 months because it segues nicely into my next point. The release cadence that we've experienced until now has been pretty much consistent since the release of LS3 Episode 1. That is when LS started to come out on a 2 - 4 month basis. It is when raids started to take 7+ months to release. Plenty of people, myself included, noted all the way back at the end of 2016 that that release pace was insufficient. We've spoken about it constantly on official forums and on reddit. Yet it continued, without much critique from the streaming circles, all the way up until now when suddenly the issue is with the "direction of PoF". Which was released almost two years ago. 
---
Please critically think why what has been acceptable for three years, two LS seasons and an expansion is now unacceptable and relate that to the circumstances of the streamers - in relation to the games they want to play and the attention they get - that are stirring things up.
---
It's so fast though when buffed, feels like so little time to jump in with other skills between AA3 and AA1 - I don't have the fastest reactions, I'm not entirely hopeless but it's definitely something I struggle with, and this seems like a very small window. Maybe I can learn to predict/anticipate in time, idk, but just standing at a golem trying to grind it into my brain doesn't work at all, just makes me fall asleep, so I'll have to find some other way to learn it.
---
then git gud and learn the the timing until it's deep in your mind and you don't have to focus anymore in order to do it right! ;p
---
What build are you playing?
---
Think I still have a Celebratory Dye pack on a bank toon somewhere, from the LV 80 boost, unopened because I don't know which dye to pick, and am holding onto it should a time arise when I need a specific color it contains.
---
And over time you get a feel for the timing of the autoattack as well. Many autoattack chains also have a minor screenshake at the end of the chain!
---
That's the quote from Anet devs btw.
---
Yea, the cursor do disappear but it's with a delay. I see how it's dragged for about 0,5mm before it disappears and the hold down right click kicks in.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if I got that checked. Been playing since release xD
---
Going to take a look and try it out when i get home, thanks!
---
Yep, because at that point in the rotation, that's the most amount of damage you can do. Since you're in shroud and shroud AA does massive damage. Unless you are dying do the AA chain 8 times to maximize damage.
---
Cantha expansion confirmed.
---
others have already given good advice for not interrupting your AA chain, but always keep in mind:  
---
you can completely ignore your AA chains and still outdps 95% of the players on the lfg if you execute the rest of your rotation correctly.  
---
its never a bad idea to improve, but pick your battles.  
---
And perfecting AA chain execution is one of the last things i would target when you tackle your dmg output.
---
To clarify a bit: OP was clear about the content he's doing.  Casual.  Open-world, no raids, little dabbling in fractals, WvW zerging.  I've been using celestial for that EXACT content, on multiple classes, for years.  OP, it'll do you just fine.
---
Basically you'll have to get used to spotting the last icon and counting everytime you see it until 8 then continue the rotation.
---
Right, but after 8 times it doesn't matter as much if I interrupt the chain?
---

It was on the front page of the webste, my dude.

I'm personally just using Martial Finisher. Not flashy, not jokey, and feels pretty much as if you're giving someone proper warrior rest.
---

---
Thank you, good thing to keep in mind! :)
---
Festival is going on. Other content is less busy during festivals. Or people are burnt out by the constant boring festival and event spam.
---
Unless you play sword weaver!
---
Maybe don't play at half past 1 on a Tuesday morning then?
---
Just made it, and imo, it only works for a Necromancer.  Sadly, Focus is one of the least useful weapons for Necro atm, but as Fashion Wars is the true endgame, I'm fine with that.
---
My pleasure :)
---
no, though you try to avoid it ever going into life slash after the 8th life reap. Once you get used to the timing you'll be able to Exit shroud and use gravedigger as soon as you see life rend activate. 
---
Basically try to avoid going into a 9th/10th/xth AA chain.
---
A poultry attempt.
---
Those are not official though. Besides, they are based on existing lore instead of expanding lore like the OP was suggesting.
---
No matter how profitable something is (within reasonable quantities), burnout is a thing and people end up stopping doing said something and go somewhere else. That aside maybe you got an unlucky hour when people happened to not be playing? I mean for a lot of people that is still lunch hour or working hour.
---
Hey, I'm working on a full analysis of gemstore trends over time, stay tuned for a thread on that, but I'm pretty sure from what I've gathered so far that you are exaggerating the trend.
---
Okay honey. I'm done. If you want to start trying to pretend that I've not been critical of the game, haven't seen people leave and I haven't seen reasoned critical discussion over the years and I'm just going with a "streamer bad" mentality then we don't have any discussion to continue.
---
You are doing the classical argument that people on your current side like to do. You ignore everything about a person, you ignore the evidence they bring, the statements they make and even their posting history so you can concoct a straw man to knock down.
---
If you actually want a reasoned discussion, you don't go presuming someone that runs statics and public raid training events isn't aware of attrition. Your arguments are in bad faith, you are refusing to take any of my points on an even ground and I won't be continuing these discussions. As I pointed out, your side like to twist things and create imaginary scenarios and like other people I've had these discussions with, your doing the same because you don't want to accept my points at face value, even when given receipts. 
---
Enjoy wallowing.

But... but GW2 is a game full of players, everyone says that GW2 isn't dying!
---
You're probably losing dps if you don't because a better skill has come off cooldown.
---
This subreddit tends to be an echo chamber. Any post is the opposite of praise, speaks a painful truth, or plays devils advocate tends to be downvoted. You don't make a comment like those if you care about being upvoted or downvoted.
---
For me the ambient NPC dialogue makes this game feel alive. In so many MMOs, only the quest giver has any dialogue. It's fun to sometimes just hang out at a heart to listen to what NPCs talk about it.
---
Text appearing sometimes on top, at the bottom or at the middle. The video feels a bit tiresome because you have to play hide and seek with your text edits. You could just add the text to the left side below the squad menu.
---
I think people got bored of event spam. Silverwastes almost every time of day has a squad running there.
---
You have to comb press to get a / in most keyboards around the world. You have to combo press to get a normal ?. You have to combo press to get a @ in most layouts too, and it has not stopped anyone from writing emails.  
---
And "/s" would simply not be as effective as a mark specifically for it for meany reasons, like other meanings that may have in different context, and with technical reasons like word wrapping that may break it in two.
---
"If ain't broke don't fix it" is a very bad mindset. We would not have a metric system if people kept sticking to old stuff just because it works, when something that works better can be used instead. A bit of inconvenience during a transition period to the better system is not a reason not to get something better.
---
Yes but players are people
---
people need to sleep
---
Map could have been empty (not dead) for various reasons
---
1. 01:27pm is a typical time where people work, especially on a weekday
---
2. Festival of the four winds is active right now
---
3. You could have joined a new map instance that has less population while other maps are more populated
---
4. players could have done it already and doing content over and over can get tiresome and boring to some
---
Just looking at one map, in one instance while a festival is going on is not a really good indicator if a map is "dying".
---
So aside from the fact that it is ironic that you claim others make straw arguments after your responses to me, please be aware that there was promotion by Teapot, on his stream, to upvote a post made on Reddit that was attacking the Anet forum moderators for deleting a post linking to Nike's conspiracy theory video. The thread was locked for stirring drama. 
---
We aren't just making these things up for the good of our health. The place would be far more pleasant if that was the case.
---
Ahah nice, Trem (the guy who did this) just shared it too :p
---
I just don't like Internet celebrities, or celebrities in general. I would rather get some game developers hosting the thing themselves, on their own way. I don't want to hear dumb artificial jokes, I want to hear the artists and the designers talking about their work. So yeah, this, in my opinion, is wasted money. Got any problem with that?
---
It's like when politicians hear musicians for their rallies. It's not a good signal.
---
Tag up yourself.
---
The original caught my attention immediately when I heard it, such a beautiful tune. I hope I did it justice!
---
But even meta events. I makes me sad when people now talk about them as a gemstone farm and rage on map chat against noob.
---
Dragon stand is a hell of MMO experience. This is genius game design and I had so much joy playing this map. It is so good at making it feel like you are a whole army pushing to one goal. From chill easy run with meta group to struggling out of prime time groups that are to outnumbered 10 people squad, this map IS the definition of MMO. To a lesser scale auric bassin too but it's shorter and easier. It's not only the story it's the gaming experience
---
That's a lot of bullshit packed tightly on a single sentence
---
Why did you make a throwaway account only for this?
---
It isn't wrong to be hyped and neither is to be cautious.   
---
People can feel whatever they want, it's a video game not the meaning of life. What a question‚Ä¶.

I gonna buy it after buying 8 characters slots + unbreakable tools. I like to start from the most useful and expensive things first.

Last updated May 6th.
---
&gt; strawman, next.
---
Provide argument. Next.
---
&gt; the mods claimed that it did
---
There's a reason they are claiming it, and considering they are the ones doing the working as moderators, I trust their judgement more than I trust yours, and they are actually the ones who want to allow criticism like this.
---
&gt; again, brigade claims were unfounded and there is no proof that it happened
---
Again, false, and there's plenty of corroborating evidence with the timing. There's not going to be any "proof" unless the site admins get involved. But it's pretty evident, I'm not the only one pointing it out:
---
https://np.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ci76gw/arenanets_response_to_criticism_censored_by/
---
&gt; there are trolls who are for neither side and just want to cause trouble, they are the ones making the shitposts.
---
The trolls are the ones who create posts and comments more so out of the reaction they will get than to contribute to a solution, yes.
---
&gt; it's ridiculous to think that there was a massive organised effort to downvote some reddit 
---
I suppose it just depends on what you call massively organized. Twitch is definitely a platform that massively organizes a viewership onto a stream, and its the streamer that leads the brigade by telling them what they should think and act. [This is brigading](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=brigading). It's not a giant conspiracy, it just happens naturally in group psychology.
---
&gt; given that teapots average viewer count is only 300 ~ and there were quite a lot more upvotes than that as well as comments
---
Nope.  The average number of viewers for the relevant stream was 393, peaking at 571, which corresponds fairly well to the numbers of upvotes. "somehow it seems you added 1 + 1 and got 4".
---
&gt; i dont even watch teapot
---
You don't have to. Again, the problem isn't with people who criticize Guild Wars 2, it's with the people brigading (the people you refuse to acknowledge exist). It's with the people when, as soon as he begins to talk about it on his stream, begin to post it on reddit and upvote it.
---
&gt; teapot was just the final straw for many people
---
You haven't even watched him or looked at his stream, and you think you can speak for everyone? You are a fish trapped by a current.
---
&gt; that sounds a whole lot like an echo chamber given how many non toxic and polite arguments have been lumped in with the toxicity exhibited by the trolls.
---
If you mean it would be open to supportive content on Guild Wars 2 instead of criticism, then yes. Contrary to contemporary belief, you are not reserved a voice in every outlet, only the possibility of having an outlet for your voice. Calling a forum for people who don't have any major issue with Guild Wars 2 and are just interested in content and news to look forward to instead of criticize an echo chamber is just **toxic**. This is not a non toxic and polite argument.
---
Axe warrior is an obvious third skill in the AA and reaper gs is really slow, no problem there. In shroud you do nr 4 and then auto attack until you lose soul barbs, third attack is one giant spin.
---
True, I totally forgot about the boss event and Dragonbash.
---
People really have no concept of just how much shit Anet has thrown at us in the few months since Dragonfall released. RIP everyone actually grinding through all that stuff. Holy fuck.
---
They probably get Charisma because flame shamans would be functionally warlocks
---
Mentor tag alone could be enough since you don't need any markers.
---
Please don't use this bad strat and use a better guide like this one

---
the dancing llama one of course.
---
Just to clarify, I was having issues while having multiple GW2 instances. I don't use launchbuddy for one-at-a-time login.
---
Control your impulses and have some patience... at least get to lvl 80 before buying gems and accept that anything being done in under one business day is shockingly fast.
---
Also take a screenshot of your traits...its more likely a gear problem but your traits could be funky too.
---
Just to clarify, Charr in Sylvary area doesn't affect anything and you two can level up and play without problems in any map. 
---
Personal story however, is dependent on your race and character creation choices, so a Sylvari can join a Charr personal story but won't gain anything from it. Personal story are a set of quest you get by mail every 10 levels, and it doesn't matter how or where you get those levels. At lvl 30 you get to select an order and if every one chooses the same one, at level 40 the stories converge in one line until the end.
---
Because its a backhanded compliment. Like walking up to someone and saying "wow you dont look as terrible as you normally do"
---
so many ridiculous replies lol..shit like "ignore autos you outdps pugs anyway" is so stupid i can't even! so imma try to clarify the whole thing
---
reaper is a great example actually! because it's one of the few exceptions where you wanna interrupt some autos, namely the gs one at some point of the rotation in order to get the gravedigger going sooner
---
however, the general rule is to not interrupt them because as some others said, the last hit tends to be powerful..it's very important for reaper shroud autos because it reduces the cooldown of other shroud skills, a key part of keeping the rotation!(not to be confused with animation-canceling it by leaving shroud early)
---
the reason a lot of people struggle with rotations is cuz they don't understand the underlying reasons of them..why they are the way they are! reaper's dps is shifted towards shroud mostly which means you should only delay it for well or nightfall and **never ever** get caught doing autoattacks in axe(if weapon swap is on cooldown just camp shroud)
---
for reaper you need the following in mind(except maybe opener): having nightfall and well of suffering ticking while in shroud, animation-canceling gs#5 and well with either shroud or weapon swap, only swap to axe when you can enter shroud right after skill #2, 5 autos in shroud which line up with soul barbs buff duration, on gs you do 3+2 so you can 2+3 before swapping to axe(above 50% of course)
---
start with a simplified rotation maybe(do not use it except for practice): well+gs4+5 enter shroud, shroud4+ 5 auto chains, gs3+2 and auto until you can repeat(if you do 3+2 then the cooldowns will naturally align for 2+3 after)
---
That's either a symptom of very bad equipment or failing the boss mechanics. For some bosses with mechanics that are not immediately obvious the wiki can be helpful.
---
Based on my own limited experience, I'd say you just had unusually *good* luck in the past that has now normalized somewhat.
---
I've been playing 5 years and the best thing I've gotten from a chest is a handful of guaranteed unlocks. Never once got any mount skins, outfits, permanent kits, unique armor or weapon skins, etc. 
---
My most valued drops are Tyrian Exchange Vouchers.
---
Not interrupting autos is usually not top priority. Using your skills properly is usually more important, and finishing chains is how you squeeze out that extra dps.
---
To learn a rotation, I would first ignore AAs and focus on getting down the skill rotation. Just sit at the golem and grind. As you get comfortable, take some time to learn the AAs, and find something you think you can identify. Animation and sound can be a hard one in a real situation, so I suggest learning either cast bars or skill art. If you can't quite get it, it isn't the end of the world for most builds, but it's good to try. I would also make sure to only practice with proper boons. If you learn the rotation with alac and quick, then you will build up your reaction times and muscle memory will learn it at the right speed.
---
You can also find builds without AA chains if you can't figure it out and it bugs you, but it honestly is not a huge deal in general.

He's in PoF unless he has them confused.
---
Hey! First of all, welcome to the game!
---
HoT PvE content is a big jump in difficulty as far as open world goes, and that is intentional. Mobs do more damage, have unique skills, or simply outnumber you (I'm looking at you, damn raptors and mushrooms!). 
---
That being said, chances are, since you are new to the game, you havent geared with all exotics, and even if you are, its possible you dont have the right stats and traits combinations. 
---
You can get away with lots of weird builds in open world PvE, but you will reach a point in HoT when doing personal story or some of the deeper maguma maps where it is no longer a viable strategy unless you are REALLY good at dodging and utilizing your cooldowns at a right time.
---
As many have said, you can post your gear and traits, as well as skill and we can help you better. Alternatively you can use this link to guide you to some builds:

---
I made it with only exotics, ascended equipment give you a very minimal damage increase (less than 5%!), so you can even do raids in exotics (dont let toxic elitists tell you otherwise, Im living proof that it can be done), but for high level fractals you WILL need ascended, but you will be surprised how easy is to get that gear in PvP, or even low level fractals.
---
Take your time, learn the mechanics of the game, dodging is an INTEGRAL part of your defense options, specially in PvP, since you can almost dodge everything for a whole second. Guardians are one of the most survivable classes out there, so you might actually get spoiled on how easy it is, and you might struggle with other classes like elemetalists.

Again, welcome and enjoy the ride \^\_\^

No, AMD's d3d9 drivers just suck.
---
&gt; "If ain't broke don't fix it"
---
That isn‚Äôt my mindset here. I‚Äôm more of the mindset of the path of least resistance since that is the path taken by most users.
---
Your ask to use AltGr doesn‚Äôt take into consideration that it isn‚Äôt on all keyboards.  So it should be ruled out as an option since keyboards without it will require looking up &amp; memorizing a combo or copy-pasting the symbol.
---
I suggest something that is _visible_ on every keyboard.  Yes, you have to shift to get the / on EU keyboards, but it‚Äôs there and readily apparent.  On US Qwerty/Dvorak keyboards it‚Äôs just there.
---
The ‚Äúthis solution works for me‚Äù is an equally bad mindset IMO.
---
&gt; like other meanings that may have in different context, and with technical reasons like word wrapping that may break it in two.
---
I don‚Äôt see these as problems in most cases since the context when it matters is usually readily apparent.  But that‚Äôs just my opinion.
---
Reaper is a great class to learn how to track AAs, because greatsword is very obvious with it's third attack, and axe doesn't have a chain, while shroud basically just camps the AA the whole time. For reaper, you can easily use animation or cast bar or sound to track your AAs on gs, so just try to grind out the rotation at the golem with proper boons
---
Nice work, the flute works really well here, as does the subtle choir. I enjoyed your interpretation of how it builds tempo and intensity.
---
wow.... facepalm.
---
No problem! Thank you for your kind words and enjoying it :-)
---
Thanks! I tried to make it evolve constantly and introducing the more intense part with percussion felt like a good idea.
---
New savage raids just dropped on XIV which aren't too bad to pug for the first half, and Mythic Eternal Palace is a nice way to get pounded in the ass and was just downed recently (the 28th).
---
So always more fun endgame stuff to chase.
---
Just because you cancelled it, doesn't mean ANet didn't receive notice of it before you cancelled it. And them receiving notice of a charge back is all it takes.
---
To be honest watching the devs play their own game is the same, except they're not eloquent and they come into contact with the game on a daily. 
---
I'd rather have a journalist explore the game for the first time than a lead designer question basic mechanics they should probably know about.
---
you can make as many smurf accounts as you want and direct friends to the post to downvote it but you can't erase the general concern and amount of comments of people that have stated they would love to have this feature in the game =)
---
Still takes a good ear and some talent. :-)
---
you're still here!? For someone that does not care for dueling why linger on a duel post for so long?
---
They could be potential new gw2 fans.

Got jebaited so hard. Kept trying to volume up my phone to hear the sound lol...

Hes announcing gw2 ls5 with mobile and console port.
---
I love this crossovers bc i like both very much.
---
Ty guys.
---
I mean it is helpful to a degree, There are games designed around dying a ton aka darksouls. 
---
This is not one of them.
---
"Living World Announcement". Going to need a lot more than announcing a new map for all this hype.
---
Wow this feels so nostalgic! Like Teldrassil (RIP) music! Can't wait for more.
---
There should be [case fans](https://www.cclonline.com/images/articles/1214_overly-technical-diagram-pc-computer-cooling-101.jpg?width=700) (at least 2; one intake and one exhaust) that move air through the case.
---
But also a [CPU heatsink and fan(s)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/AMD_heatsink_and_fan.jpg/1200px-AMD_heatsink_and_fan.jpg) just to keep the CPU cool.  There needs to be [thermal paste](https://ageeky.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/fO-tGPxg9EIu.878x0.Z-Z96KYq.jpg) between the heatsink/fan and the CPU so heat is transferred efficiently.
---
If you don't want to risk making a mess with thermal paste, I recommend using a [thermal pad](https://www.innovationcooling.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ic-graphite-40X40-mm-480X480.png) that you just place between the CPU and heatsink.

 TjMax is more important and for this chips it should be around 91C
---
&gt; nope, there were no empty custom PVP lobbies as you stated
---
There are loads.
---
&gt; if you join an empty public lobby you are at risk of other players joining in and starting a match
---
Nobody plays custom arenas. There is less than 20 people in them right now, Half of those are in a farming arena, the other half in Arenanet owned ones.
---
If someone joins, you just move.

Nope, that's for World v World not PvP.

Clearly not because the amount of misinformation you are typing is ridiculous.

Ear is all I have hah

Because sometimes Reddit is the only way to get Anet's attention because their own website is absolutely inefficient.

Once they notice it they will suspend your account. You can solve the problem before that.

"No empty custom arenas"

"We have to be on different servers to join same custom arena"

Two easy things to try would be the -repair [Command Line Argument](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Command_line_arguments#-repair) and [clearing your game cache](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5bncp5/psa_dont_forget_to_clear_your_cache/).
---
If those don't work, I would double-check that you didn't have a recent windows update that might've changed things.  Next I would reinstall/update mouse drivers/software and if you have a gaming mouse with on-board memory I would double-check settings, reapply the profile, and check for firmware updates.
---
I just count in my head 1,2,3 1,2,3. You can get the rhythm down by going somewhere quiet like a special forces training area golem. Over time you get the overall beat. And like he said, some classes the third hit is longer. So for my weaver I count 1,2,     And 3. And bar fills slower that‚Äôs when you know it‚Äôs done.  You keep saying the window is too short to react but if you try counting to three outloud it‚Äôs pretty manageable. Try it!

If you play PvP you get a lot of charges, so he might be a PvP main

Probably too sensitive, but I'm just too curious. What do you think about the 10/10 -IGN meme?
---
What software did you use to orchestrate it?
---
Sekiro. Lots of fun to play solo.
---
Necro and ranger imo are the two most survivable class because of minions/pets that can take aggro off you while you pepper the enemy at range.
---
I think everyone is also forgetting another thing. GPUs are also bound by your processor so if you are running an older intel core or AMD processor most likely your GPU is being bottlenecked by your gimp CPU. its like putting a Triton V10 into a Yugo. Please consider all aspects of your build not just the GPU for frame timings. If your cpu cant keep up with your GPU dont expect your games to either
---
&gt; The reason to never interupt auto attack chains is because the third attack is the by far the strongest out of the three. 
---
most of the time.  not always.
---
They pseudo-hype things up by being so secretive now. They over-hyped when they were not secretive. They just do not know how to get it right.
---
Tbh ele is pretty strong after last patch and you could do anything in open world on any class at any point. 
---
Test every class in pvp lobby and see what fits you the most.
---
So pick a build from it then, how the hell are random people supposed to know what you enjoy.
---
Any class can solo open world.
---
Reaper. But the software doesn't matter as long as it has VST/AU support. As for the sample libraries (virtual instruments), I used Sonuscore The Orchestra, 8dio Agitato Sordino Strings, Adventure Brass and Forest Kingdom II.
---
I too am guilty of doing this.
---
The OP says he "just hit 80" I doubt he has even exotic gear much less ascended. Probably missing trinkets as well.
---
I've heard of various overlay-type softwares causing this - namely, Discord's in-game overlay and Nvidia Shadowplay. Worth looking into those.
---
You're not just AAing for no reason. You're filling the space between your nightfall (GS4) cooldown, basically. You stop at 8 specifically becase when you drop shroud at 8 autos after doing the prior part of the rotation correctly, you maximize the amount of damage you're doing out of shroud as well while ensuring that your next nightfall will be 1) cast as soon as possible and 2) have most of its damage affected by the bonuses you get by being in shroud. Which basically means, leave shroud so the cooldown comes back in time for you to reenter shroud. This is less of an issue for the opener but for the rest of the rotation it's very important since you're squeezing a weapon swap from axe to gs in there as well. 
---
Fortunately, it's not that hard to just mash your shroud button and 2 as hard as you can once you finish that last auto.
---
Tomes of knowledge are your friend. For example from PvP (good place to get some survivability as well).
---
Btw. once you get mounts, like griffon - you can do adventures daily, it takes like a minute and you get huge chunks of exp, and yes, with mounts you can sneak through lvl 80 maps with low lvl characters :)
---
there are easy ways to level :)
---
yeah, I originally started on 5e, then swapped to PF and then started using the Spheres of Power/Might system, I don't think I can ever go back simply because its so versatile in character building
---
IMO if you are asking anywhere but Google for "how to ..." you're new to the internet
---
Well I'm no weaver expert but you need a lot of after cast cancelling and imo its better to press AA instead of praying to the auto attack cycle. Don't think it makes much difference tho but its easier to count it that way.
---
Is this the thread where pvpers who say nothing ever gets done with pvp discount this because it doesn't fix 100% of their problems?
---
Seriously, I agree Anet ignores the sPvP community but at least this is at least something for you guys and potentially a start.
---
But WvW got the Warclaw !
---
"There, we saved your game mode." - Anet (probably)
---
The very first response is the correct answer.
---
Choya Finisher, then drop siege on their corpse, get respected
---
/s
---
It's not wrong to be excited, however getting excited over things that you *want* to happen rather than things the devs have *said* will happen, and then getting angry or disappointed over what you imagined getting rather than what you actually got, isn't generally a good idea. I'm plenty excited about what we'll learn on the 30th, but I'm also trying to resist the temptation to go wild with speculation - they've booked an awfully long time for just a Living World episode, so there will very likely be other things beyond that, but it's pointless to try and guess precisely what.
---
More outfit packages on sale... yay... /s
---
i think y'all did a great job at that. thank you :)
---
Love this update, and there were so many people saying how ArenaNet gave up on pvp.
---
This is actually what the game needs, content. Even if it's not much, it's surely better than nothing.
---
Im at work how much do the gloves cost
---
So,there are only for PvP and not WvW included. GG Anet.
---
And again it's just those packaged full of useless additional stuff. Worst anniversary sale ever.
---
My goodness these anniversary sales suck so far.
---
What a gorgeous map noone will play, as there's no 2v2 tournament or 2v2 queue.
---
the same was said for the mount in WvW.  It was something noone in the WvW community asked for.  Instead of addressing real problems in WvW they gave the gamemode a mount.
---
The issue then is the same as now: it's not about the map or the mount it's about what it means.  It clearly shows Anet is completely out of touch with what the players of those modes actually want or care about.  Instead of fixing issues they just give them something no one really wanted or asked for.
---
This is by far the most retarded post I've ever read on this sub and reddit combined. Please tell me this is some kind of advanced shitpost and not real.
---
But we need 2 vs 2 game mode to play on this map, ArenaNet.
---
A tuning fork?
---
Not bad! Shame there's no update on the armour they mentioned some time back, how it will be acquirable, if it will be upgradable etc tho! I'm still more excited about that!
---
I hope they don't lock these types of rewards behind the very limited participation tournaments!
---
thanks!   Here's the link

I remember encountering the same problem. If I remember correctly, at the start of the mission, don't talk to Tomm and go directly to each of the towers to clear them, and when you're done all that, go back and start the interaction.
---
500
---
I will play 2v2, just because you don't like it does not mean "barely anyone will play"
---
only thing i could think of would be its a tankier option, but still an odd choice.  Fragments of Faith would probably be a better choice for surviveability in open world.
---
they are talking about the weapon set, which was announced to be available from both modes, yet this announcement suggests it'll only be available through spvp.
---
Mesmers are pretty fun to play.  A Mirage Axe Mesmer feels nearly invincible.
---
I definitely agree with you that bots and afk are problems.
---
Does that mean that nothing else gets done pvp related until those problems are fixed?
---
I am not sure if we want the artists making the new weapon skins to make game balance decisions.
---
Shipping and handling costs a lot so they cannot afford to price stuff to sell in large volumes otherwise they will lose money! At least that is what people who make tons of money tell me.
---
It means that because they didn't get what they wanted they feel Anet should not have bothered making other gamers happy.
---
These weapons, in the main post, were created for both PvP and WvW. Do you see in the OP post, something about being in WvW too?
---
If only there was a queue for 2v2...
---
&gt; AltGr can be done with Ctrl+Alt too in most layout
---
I should have said what I meant rather than what I said... The characters avaialable with that key combo/AltGr isn‚Äôt readily apparent looking at many non-EU keyboards.
---
Yes, the PvP weapons will be for PvP only, who would have thought? They have always been separate sets, why would they suddenly not be?
---
What's the outfit in the screenshots?
---
Does that matter with digital copies?
---
wthats that outfit the npc is wearing?
---
I'm not sure what percentage of the PvP community plays 2v2 but it's not a ranked queue mode, so I'd guess the most invested players are only doing it sometimes as a break. 
---
This would be like getting another festival instead of a raid wing for pve. Yes probably people asked for it and were happy to get it. No it didn't actually fix the content issues plaguing the modes the most invested players play. 
---
PvP games don't *need* maps, they need balance. How many people have played anything other than De_dust in counterstrike/counterstrike 2? How many years did people play just one map per mode in wow pvp? (ab, wsg, av) 
---
What makes PvP work is good balance, or at least cyclic OP style balance with short cycles. Adding more maps isn't going to address how frustrating actually playing can be.
---
ha, that's the sad part....it wasn't even about a boss.  They were veteran's with chains that pull you in and then they run you over.  Guess I really need to work on my skills (or lack thereof).  I need something like a burgler in LOTRO where I can sneak around and yell 'surprise' while I stab them in the back.   8-)
---
I just want a 2v2 queue, man. I'd absolutely love to play all these 2v2 maps and play something other than conquest, but the fact I can only play on rare occasions when they decide to do a one-off tournament kinda sucks.
---
hehe, at least there's no where to go but up!
---
A few general tips: 
---
* Scepter/Focus (or Torch) is better than Bow. Bow is bad if you want to kill stuff fast. 
---
* Get proper gear, your stats are all over the place. Try to go for exotic berserker's. Don't worry about not having toughness or vitality. Because:
---
* Avoiding damage is better than just trying to minimize the damage you take. So dodge and use Aegis.
---
* Use your classes abilities. 
---
 Take "Retreat!" instead of the spirit bow. (It provides you with Aegis) Maybe take Renewed focus, which gives you 3s invuln and recharges all your virtues (More block through Shield of Courage)
---
Take either Shelter (another block) or Litany of Wrath (damage you deal will heal you) as heal skill. 
---
* Trait-wise drop Honor and go for more damage focus, like radiance. 
---
Maybe someone else can chime in as well.
---
I hate to say it, but vote by leaving.
---
Anet is always trying to encourage activity, right? They don't seem to care about whether we're having fun, as long as we're playing. And they give us the fear of "if you don't show us enough support, maybe we'll shut down."
---
But that's not how this is supposed to work. Log in less. Play less. Don't idle in mistlock or LA. Let their numbers show that what they are doing is not working. Either they have what it takes to respond to players, and will respond when forced to, or they don't have what it takes and they're just stringing us along until we enjoy the game less and less and finally quit.
---
That's just my take. Don't go easy on the devs because we're afraid of losing the game. We're going to lose it anyways no matter how many chances we give the devs if they're clearly not using any of those chances.
---
I've stopped logging in daily. I'll still come check out festivals, their stats can show that I still check in now and then but generally don't play.
---
thanks!  I'll do some comparisons to how I'm running and what you build shows!
---
.
---
totally agree....just struggling a bit with the 'have fun'.  I need to go through the PoF quest line so i can get a flying mount at some point in the future.
---
To be fair, I usually gets codes emailed instantly.  
---
However, if I didn't receive it after 12 hours and was truly worried, I'd send an email to support and wait for a response before submitting a charge back claim.  That's insane.
---
There's no queue for this map mode. 
---
Maps (after the first one for a mode) aren't what make PvP work - people have played literally decades of just de_dust at this point in counterstrike happily. 
---
What makes PvP work is balance. Balance between the classes/roles/specs and balance of the rewards in PvP vs time spent (since this is an MMO)
---
A new map is "nice" but it's not really attention beyond letting us know that they haven't completely forgotten spvp is in the game.
---
Gotta use those assets from abandoned projects somewhere. 
---
Now for them to implement an actual 2vs2 sPvP game mode to play the freaking map outside of custom battles.
---
are you trying to say metrics for 2v2 show higher numbers than metrics for 5v5? are you stupid?
---
Love this community
---
Brand new doa content for pvp! Neat!
---
oh I thought this was going to have a queue. I did not read that it would be custom only
---
&gt; I'm just in maintenance mode, same as GW2's end-game, waiting to find something else that gives me joy again so I can leave this game behind.
---
I have never felt such resonance with any other sentence o7
---
&gt;You're filling the space between your nightfall (GS4) cooldown, basically.
---
Am I, though? Because it doesn't look like I'm using Nightfall off cooldown or as often as possible? 
---
Reaper's rotation just doesn't really make a lot of sense to me in general, I'm sure there's a reason for everything and it makes sense if you're used to it but to me it seems random - not using Shroud 4 as often as possible even though that's one of the best damage dealers, for example, and just the flow of it doesn't feel natural. In open world (including group content like meta events, bounties, world bosses etc) I focus on getting off nightfall+gravedigger combo and ghastly claws inbetween soul spiral - the rest of the time I press whatever skills are off cooldown based on how effective they seem to be (ie if CC bar is up then it's CC skills, if I'm low on health or life force it's those skills).  
---
I'm thinking maybe I should just try raiding on a different class where I don't have preconcieved notions about the rotation, but then the problem is picking which class.
---
Mmh, I dont like the way theyre doing the 2v2 restriction. Disabling stealth makes some sense since you dont want permastealth thieves and Mesmers, but that totally locks thieves out of their stealth attacks, which in case of Deadeye is a big issue. There is also the big problem that bunker builds still survive easily during that phase while glassy builds stand no chance. I would change it so that stealth instead just does damage (instead of being disabled) while youre in it, with a pretty hefty amount at that, and blocks, invulns and evades all do damage to you.
---
It's more fun if you don't tell people it's sarcasm.  The downvotes from people who don't understand your sarcasm make it even better.
---
Didn‚Äôt you hear the news? Because facts are irrelevant and we make our own realities now.
---
Why would someone choose this over the other two options?
---
&gt; ever visited IGN
---
but why &gt;&lt;
---
&gt; Dtealth will be disabled.
---
Well thieves are completely fucked
---
The current situation is that 2v2 has no queue and the announcement doesn't mention changing it.
---
There's a bit of contradictory opinions floating around in here, but it's all *mostly* right, even if it seems contradictory. I mainn Necro myself, and up until recently I only really played Reaper, even though I've been working on my Scourge a lot recently.
---
Not interrupting your auto attacks and/or counting your auto attacks is something you should try to do, yet it isn't as important as a lot of people make it out to be. It's something you're doing to maximize your dps, not something that you're required to do to get decent dps.
---
For Reaper you want to try and land the third hit in your greatsword chain for the life force and the chill more than the damage. If you fuck it up and interrupt it, though, it isn't likely to be a huge deal. Even if you're the only necro, between your pet, grasping darkness, frost spirit, chrono well, and alacrigade skills the boss will likely still have chill on it. You'll also likely not get fucked up overly much due to 5% life force here and there.
---
You'll also lose more dps by stalling your big dps combo (GS4-GS5, swap, Axe 2, well, shroud, Shroud 4, Shroud auto attacks) to fit in another greatsword auto attack chain than you will by interrupting the auto attack chain.
---
Also the reason you're counting auto attacks while in shroud is that you can fit exactly 5 full auto attack chains after using soul spiral before your soul barbs buff falls off.
---
So if you're having trouble counting the attacks because of how fast they are, you can try to just keep an eye on the soul barbs icon and swap out of shroud when it falls off. You'll only have to worry about watching the icon itself at first, then you should sort of get the hang of noticing when it starts to flash and then disappears in your peripheral vision without needing to look directly at your UI.
---
Because 95% of the loot you get are blues and greens. This only cost 3 copper per salvage.   
---
The silver fed o matic is good for salvaging yellows and oranges. You only salvage orange with this if you don't care about the sigil/rune. You use the black lion salvage kit if the sigil/rune is important.  
---
The last one seems inferior to silver fed o matic.
---
I use sounds queues. 
---
Thief staff: -  -  - - - -  -  -  - - - -
---
Thief DD. -  - -  -  -  - -  -
---
Thief Sword: -  -   -  -  -   -
---
Maps do not keep PVP alive, hell league's Esports scene has survived years on a single map.
---
I see that does kind of suck then, I would much rather just have a queue for it then.
---
Ah, I see.  Thank you!
---
You're welcome.
---
most people i know in both communities rather have nothing. what they give us sometimes is generally a huge slap in the face. which is why people have left this game. the updates they give us many times only have made things worse
---
The PvP side of a festival is a couple boxes of junk to roll high on gold that PvP players mostly don't need or use. 
---
The actual maps and events are pve. 
---
&gt; does this mean that all other work gets put on hold until the pvp scene is at a good balance?
---
Of course not, because art and asset teams aren't your balance team, and coding for arts and assets is hopefully also *not* your balance team's job. 
---
&gt; That seems to be far easier to implement than balancing 27 classes (9 base + prestiges).
---
At this point I think most people would be happy if there were 9 well balanced classes (one spec per class). 
---
But this is the point, right? They do what's *easy* and give (almost) no indication that they're working on what's hard.
---
The only really good deal listed here is the PoF prep pack, and that's only if you really need a set of unbreakable gathering tools. 
---
Hopefully they rotate the Wild Magic BP and Warclaw mounts in soon...
---
I probably would though there are two major reasons.
---
1) crappy connection makes downloading other stuff take an eternity with games getting larger and larger
---
2) out of the other games I've looked at they don't look like much of an improvement. On the other hand reviews are not a replacement for hands on trial
---
3) ultimately it will depend on how successful I am at dragging friends off to whatever other game because even shitty games can be fun with friends
---
I am certainly not afraid of losing the game. 
---
I doubt they are all that concerned about logins compared to income. Obviously people need to be logging in to spend money but login only represents potential. They haven't released anything that I would want to buy in a very long time(depending on whether or not you want to count the expansions for that). I am also not one of those foolish "I will spend money to support the devs" type because I am a "I will spend money in exchange for goods and services" type. As I just said they don't have any goods to offer to me. The game itself could be considered a service but wasn't buying the game supposed to cover that? If not then they should have picked a better business model.
---
plenty of maps and game modes in smite which has way more players than gw2 if we are going to use MOBA maps as a comparison to gw2
---
Still sad the final name for the new weapon set wasn't **VAINGLORIOUS WEAPONS**.
---
All is vain.
---
Couldn't agree more. I wanna grab a friend do some matches and that's it. Of course rewards have to be there as well.
---
that is the point, they intentionally made it lackluster in their attempt to have elite specs have trade offs instead of being straight better versions of core specs (even though they originally completely butchered the acrobatics traitline in order to make daredevil appealing to people)
---
No one cares about Smite in the MOVA scene.
---
Well, Smite does it's got a thriving esports scene, too bad gw2 can't say the same.
---
Make a character. Take it into the PvP lobby and try stuff against the mobs(the profession NPCs and stuff like the chieftain and svanir) in the combat training area.
---
&gt; Why is Anet even wasting time making all this content for what is, aside from raiders, the most toxic part of the community? This update is too good for them.
---
don't mind me, i'm just a sucker for a good chunk of irony. it's like chocolate to me.
---
Logins and activity are metrics they can show to potential investors, along with things like revenue of course. They are important to a game dev, especially one in shaky financial situation like Anet who have just laid off a tonne of employees.
---
I feel ya on staying for the friends. A word of suggestion, if this is the only game or one of a few that you play, and you're really not enjoying it much, it might be healthy to diversify a bit. Try something else, different genre even.
---
Happy the ppl making costum games for 2v2 get another map but i aint touching it unless it gets a q. Also may be an unpopular opinion but i think 3v3 would be better.
---
Do you use Free Cam as well? Free camera is the left mouse button, allowing you to see around you without moving your character or interrupting forward attacks. As states above the use of "about face" to turn around. There's also a "look behind" option as well. As far as the right mouse click to spin camera, no. Many people have brought it up but there is no change.
---
*friendliest gaming community btw
---
If you‚Äôre suppose to ‚Äùswipe‚Äù enemies, give it a stun. Realistically if someone with a staff ran at me and swiped me I‚Äôd be on the floor.
---
We all know it, and we all already voiced our criticism about it the instant the early notes were released.
---
Where other specs' "nerfs" can be justified by something unique changing, the DD nerf was literally a nerf with nothing interesting added besides a new icon - it felt like nothing but a last minute decision made to nerf the spec.
---
Beating this dead horse won't get ANet to change their mind. If it did, thief's balance changes would actually be logical. However, looking at the history of thief changes since 2012, it is evident that nobody in the balance team actually cares about the class (it's more of an afterthought). This is partly because they don't seem to understand their own class, nor know what they want the class to be able to do. They don't seem to have an actual vision for the class. It basically feels like a class that they included simply because they knew there would be players who like that "assassin" kind of archetype.
---
This is great and its nice to see they aren't going dark in terms of updates till the 30th but I hope this update also brings current events that lead to the announcement but for PvP players this is nice.
---
Maybe try out different weapons and utility skills on them. And pay special attention to which of skills actually do good damage. 
---
You shouldn't have any problem laying down comparable damage with the ele if it is geared and built correctly.
---
I'll be honest I still don't know who this Greg guy is.
---
/r/selfawarewolves
---
I'm not great, but I've pugged t4 fractals, so I'd say I'm at least decent. My main is a Firebrand, but I can't play a Dragon Hunter for crap. I get sneezed on and die. So, I feel your pain.
---
Just what everyone has been asking for, a 2v2 map that no one will play.
---
Give us a f*cking queue for 2v2s. Right now its only used as a filler so the ever downsizing pvp-community doesnt go insane from the stale boredom of 7 years of conquest with an amount of maps that can be counted on a single hand. Please give us a queue, I cant be arsed to play it just for X weeks untill daddy Anet decides I've enjoyed the actual game too much and takes it away for no apparent reason. (And dont give me that splitting the community bs, thx.)
---
That's why I say we need to make them a standard.
---
They are not readily apparent looking because they are not standard.
---
did sum1 link one of ur own comments 2 that sub once or summit?
---
Ahahahahahaha thanks sir, love the humor, can smell that sarcasm XD
---
The thing is, it is intentionally unattractive. You choose daredevil not because of steal skill, but because of other unique properties.
---
Its a waste of their resources if they burry it behind custom matches. it would be like them making a new mount and locking it in a lw instance  or smth.
---
Runecrafter‚Äôs salvage o matic is best for greens w/ runes/sigils, but it‚Äôs only for min-maxing if you‚Äôre into spending 600 gems for that.
---
I like both designs of LA TBH. But I think it's a shame that one of them is no longer accesible.
---
At least it would be a new game
---
You're missing my point. I agree that you need arena damage after a while, but don't agree that it should be a fixed damage value. This punishes anything that uses stealth and/or is squishy.
---
Is the PoF Preparation Pack worth it? It's on a discount currently and I wonder if it's a good buy.
---
I was considering buying the Bag Unlock and maybe Unlimited Tools also (although I'm still not certain if it's worth it for me...), however now they are in a bundle so it may seem like a good deal - at first I thought: "That's great! I essentialy get 10 keys and a character slot for free!", but I really do not want to regret this decision.
---
What do you think? Are the Unlimited Tools good enough to consider buying the whole Preparation Pack?
---
We battle royale now boyz
---
Actually previously those packs haven't been discounted so it is highest they have been and Anet probably counts them as discounted from 2k to 1.6k as packages regularly so their additional discount is low like %15. Problem is their content is mostly filler. I do not want a random dye package or a mini pet to boost the value of it artificially.
---
On the other hand the discount on exo-mounts pack and Path of Fire Preparation Pack is actually pretty sweet.
---
Don‚Äôt worry living world season 5 incoming
---
The game itself league of legends has released multiple game modes over the years no, yes the esports exclusively play around summoner's rift but lets be real, esports? Really?
---
The Wintersday project is yearly. This is something else :3
---
Why not? Other studios do that for a bunch of diff upcomming stuff all the time.
---
3v3‚Äôs would be way better, but I don‚Äôt think that will ever happen considering they won‚Äôt even add 2‚Äôs for whatever dumb reason.
---
I thought this was going to be a parody of Salmon Dance for some reason.
---
That would probably be a good idea
---
Maybe they are planning on doing just that with the update..?
---
I hope these weapons are being added to WvW too, in the original post they mentioned they would be (the naming post), but this one seems to have dropped WvW completely. Unless they're getting a later release for them in WvW? But that wouldn't really make sense either.
---
Yesss WvW and PvP are saved
---
Also guild systems plus the lack of guild-based content. This is another major pain point of the game where nothing really encourages you to group up and play together.
---
There's an option in the game's audio settings to mute some Legendary effects...
---
Here are some cheap sources of exotic berserkers armor:
---
Verdant Brink: collect airship parts and buy blades armor from vendor at the first waypoint. You can get everything except a chest piece for 1 gold apiece. 
---
Cursed Shore: karma vendor at the Temple of Grenth. Be aware that karma temple gear cannot be salvaged. So be careful putting expensive armor runes into karma armor. 
---
TP: search for Nika‚Äôs as the armor name. 
---
Use laurels to get berserkers stats ascended trinkets and rings, and to start out you can get a berserkers stats exotic back piece using guild commendations at the guild trader. If you have living story season 3, you have access to easy ascended back pieces and trinkets too that don‚Äôt cost laurels or guild commendations but rather map currency that you farm by playing the map.
---
Which one isn't?
---
Anet fanboys came fast and hit hard
---
bow after kill and once he tries to self ress interupt and /spit
---
If Anet through and empty map in open world is that an update?
---
If you're going to play through HoT then Sylvari might be good as it's slightly different for them.
---
You must be new here
---
No rainbow llama?
---
&gt; It basically feels like a class that they included simply because they knew there would be players who like that "assassin" kind of archetype.
---
The most condemning sentiment. Stealth also just feels like an "obligatory" mechanic that . . honestly doesn't feel great in GW2.
---
Thanks!
---
Ive tested them in open world PvE, with full exotics power builds. I looked on Metabattle for insight
---
Never thought of doing this, I will definitely try this out

For gear, get berserkers everything. Marauders is a better option for solo open world, but it's way harder to get, and not as good for fractals/raids.
---
Impact+Force sigils are the best (and most expensive)
---
Night + slaying sigil (any you like) is a good budget option. Another good budget sigil is strenght (for solo open world).
---
Scholar runes are the best (but expensive). Flame legion is a cheap replacement, and Fireworks is bis for open world (again, not good for fractals).
---
But that is proving my point. The past year+ its been constant posts about how Anet gives pvp nothing (and I agree). Now you and several others are saying in this same thread nothing would have been better than this.
---
To answer your question... if I got nothing for a year then got a new 1-15 lvl zone. yeah its a start because I would assume a new race or new storyline is coming along.
---
I do have a mesmer, so Ill try out Mirage Axe and see how it is
---
My ele is I believe a weaver, so maybe im doing something wrong
---
No because by the time your level 80 you'll have the whole core class unlocked.
---
i am not going to click this... i just know there are going to be pins and as a pin collector its gonna break my heart that i can't get them...
---
You get enough points to unlock everything just by getting to level 80, so don't worry about unlocking bad things. The additional hps you get from the challenges found around the world can go towards unlocking things before you hit 80 or unlocking elite specs after 80, provided you own the expacs! 
---
[This wiki page has a bit more info on hps.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hero_point)
---
so i can just train everything one by one with this hereo points? every single skill?
---
Unbreakable tools (2400 gems) are really nice but personally I might wait till the [volatile magic tools](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Infinite_Volatile_Magic_Gathering_Tools) (2700 gems) go on sale. Character slots (800 gems)are one of the best upgrades you can get and are much more effective even for storage space than other options so they are always great to get on sale. Bag slots (400 gems) aren't all that great with multiple characters and usually add only 20 slots to one character. They keys (~900 gems) are a nice bonus but not really make or break imo. Lastly the level 80 boost (2000 gems) is not worth the price at all, it's really rather easy to level in this game and you get 2 boosts already with the expansion. So out of the 6900 gems "worth" of unlocks it really comes down to the character slot and tools (at least for me personally), the pack being on sale is still pretty great but it feels kind of inflated in price at 3500 normally (now 2,625). If you're fine with the tools and character slot it's still much cheaper than buying them on their own and you get all the other items as a bonus so it's really going to come down to a personal choice. All that being said, if you haven't gotten a a [copper-fed-salvage kit](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Copper-Fed_Salvage-o-Matic) I would suggest getting that first then deciding if you want the pack (it's on sale now for 600 gems).
---
I would not recommend berserker's gear to someone who isn't very good at the game and is already frustrated at dying all the time, especially as a low hp guardian. Sure, zerker is great when you know exactly what you are doing and are trying to speedrun instances. But this guy is going to be better served by taking a relatively minor damage loss for a huge hp boost with marauder's equipment.
---
What kind of deadeye are you using? Dagger/dagger or rifle? Deadeye is actually one of the weaker dps classes especially if you take into account cleave. One issue you may have is the playstyle of deadeye vs rev and ele. Deadeye and thief in general are pretty spammy and their rotations basically spam one skill whereas ele and rev both have many skills in the rotation. You are probably not doing a proper rotation or using the right skills to deal damage.
---
For a unique story and an immersive experience, I'd suggest Sylvari. Specifically, for the Malyk storyline. Beyond that, if you own Heart of Thorns, Mordremoth will invade your mind on occasion. Extra little bonus there. Thematically, Sylvari and Nature, I'd go Elementalist (Mage).
---
This is not good advice. Traits are crazy strong, and you'll want basically always be running as many full trait lines as you can for whatever level you are.
---
Weaver is one of the highest, single target dps classes in the game. The meta for it is sword/dagger. Have you looked at the snowcrows website or on meta battle at the builds there? 
---
I haven't played weaver much so I don't have any tips for you there. I play scepter/warhorn tempest in full ascended zerk gear as my main and can assure you that the damage potential of the ele is there once you know the class.
---
True...ish. Copper-Fed was 35% off last year (520 Gems), but also at the end of the sale in September. This year it's at the start and only 25% off (600 Gems).
---
power based healers\* my bad
---
I think Dragonhunter is a bit squish. I just play vanilla guardian most of the time, with a combination of Marauders armor and half of my trinkets, and everything else is berserker.
---
They do have a set of 5 pins as a seperate tier, if you can't afford the whole bundle.
---
Can add it to unranked
---
Did you play GW1? In the beginning the only way you could access end-game content (FoW/UW) was by winning HA (PvP). HA also gave exclusive weapons, ala crystal sword, dwarven axe, etc. GvG was also highly competitive and you could earn special cape aesthetics that you could never get in PvE. The goal of pvp isn‚Äôt simply winning. It‚Äôs winning and making sure everyone else knows it via items and titles you can feel proud of and that have impact.
---
make it ground targeted?
---
Magic seems to be a relatively clean source of energy if it's handled properly (barring things like thaumanova or dragon magic) and charr tech has shown it can be combined with asura tech (the pact airships) so maybe the two races can work together to clean things up.
---
I know they don't like magic due to their history with the flame legion, but flame legion's problem wasn't magic use, it was the worship of false gods, deception of the rest of their race, religious tyranny, and sexism. Magic is just another tool, another weapon they can use like a sword. That's how the asura tend to view it, anyway.
---
If you had all the materials in storage and don't consider using them as a 'cost', the poster is correct.  In reality, there isn't a huge difference in cost (something like 50-80 gold cheaper?) but it takes a whole heck of a lot more steps/stages/clicks.
---

---
This amounts to absolutely nothing to PvP players. It's the 3rd 2v2 map. There's no queue for 2v2. No automated tournaments for 2v2. No rewards for 2v2. To use this map you have to find a custom server running the map and either hope there are 3 other people in it already, or bring 3 people you know. 
---
A better example would be them adding a new zone but it has 0 enemies, 0 vistas, 0 hearts, 0 NPCs and you can just run around it if you feel like going out of your way to get there in the first place. If they add the enemies, vistas, hearts and NPCs (queues and automated tournaments) people won't care if it is level 1-15 (no ranked queue, no tournament rewards or very few rewards). But if ANet added a zone out in the middle of nowhere with literally nothing in it as their only PvP update in a year, people would complain.
---
You pretty much answered yourself. You'll get better overtime. Dodges are important and knowing when to dogde is more important. For example. I can pretty much always dodge the pocket raptor attacks. I just got used to it. When the dredge shoot etc. Pretty much overtime seeing the animations and 'feeling' the timing becomes almost subconcious. On weaver s/d FA it's a tad easier since you get plenty of extra evades and plenty CC. Other than that there really is nothing much else to say. When gw2 was released anets balance logic (at least for pve) was squishy=big dps, tanky=low dps. Sadly now everything other than ele and thief are both tanky and do big dps (at least in open world) biggest offender of which is reaper. Balance has changed at least, I believe only half a year ago ele was both the squishiest and did mediocre dps. Atm ele does big dps again. Thief too but thief always had amazing disengage and stealth at least.
---
whats the point of min maxing when 99.9% of people will never even come close to recouping the cost of the item to begin with? its purely a convenience item.
---
Oh man FA or JQ would be so much fun but I also wish that GW2 would have explored PvP a bit more.
---
This is more of an alt-friendly guide than a 20 minute guide, as most of these things take like less than 5 minutes.
---
\- **Material Farms** \- There are patches of farms where you can park an alt  [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Node\_farm](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Node_farm)  for lots of materials
---
\- **Charged Quartz Crystal creation** \- Use 25 Quartz Crystals to create a [Charged Quartz Crystal](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Charged_Quartz_Crystal) to make Skyscale Food or Legendaries  [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shaemoor\_Garrison](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shaemoor_Garrison)  probably the best WP for it
---
\- **Boss Alts** \- Park a character at a Boss location for a chance at rare loot. Tekkit covers alot of good spots in his video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waujA3ScGMU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waujA3ScGMU)
---
\- **Key Farm** \- If you have Tomes of Experience, you can spend 8 to level a new Human Commoner(Story) Warrior/Guardian to level 10, then do the level 10 story for a Black Lion Key (1 per week, reset Monday).
---
\- **One World Boss** \- Usually takes less than 20 minutes
---
\- **Do Dailies** (general/specific, etc.) - They usually reward 2g, and other more map-specific ones reward 
---
I'd say it's more about setting goals, if you are after Ascend Gear, then maybe set a Goal to login to WvW, or gather the materials to craft it. If you are working towards a Legendary, you can do something Obsidian Shard related, as there are many ways to get Obsidian Shards.  If you haven't maxed out Masteries, then maybe work on Mount Masteries, etc. Hope this helps somewhat
---
I'd say GW2 using DX9 in 2019 **is** the problem.
---
At level 80 you earn enough points from level up rewards to train all your core skills. Any extra points you earn in Core maps can be used later to unlock elite specs traits and skills early before you get expansion hero points.
---
Yellow challenges give 1 point, green challenges give 10 points, and blue challenges... well, we'll see about those.
---
LW S3 currency farming. Even if you don't currently have a need for ascended trinkets, always best to keep a full stock of them in storage, and you can easily pop into Bloodstone Fen and Bitterfrost and farm up Blood Rubies and Winterberries, and Siren's Reef for Orrian Pearls and oysters.
---
Since the vast majority of loot now drops as "unidentified" and you can trading post entire stacks at a time, is it really still worth the time to ID everything and salvage with copper fed?
---
According to the last numbers I've seen thrown about, you only average about 1.2g more for an entire stack of blue unid's that way.  Is 500 clicks worth 1.2g?
---
Honestly, I think they should do away with the Steal entirely and just make it a shadowstep.
---
A Thief is... a Thief.
---
A Daredevil is a goddamn Ninja! NInjas don't steal! Ninjas flank you in the back, use cool gadgets, hide in shadows, and move really, really fast!
---
I have a similar system (with 16 gb ram instead)  and I get around 45 to 60 fps in PoF zones with medium high settings. Your GPU/CPU is either overheating, causing throttling or your display cable is connected to the motherboard instead of the GPU.
---
I decided to pass up on the normal Unlimited Tools for now (and therefore - Preparation Pack aswell) and I've got myself a Copper-Fed-Salvage Kit.
---
Now I'll just wait to see what else will be on a discount. I actually still have to buy LS 2, 3 and 4, while having 5k gems left to spend.
---
Thanks for your help :)
---
It's the same group of people so its pretty safe to assume the attention to detail will be the same.
---
So you'd rather they just leave it broken for however long it will take to put in the proper fix? The whole point of disabling a thing is because it is much faster to disable that thing than it is to put in a proper fix. Problems in code are not always so easy to find/diagnose. Usually identifying what is even causing the problem is like 90% of the time involved.
---
Mediocre!
---
WvW has got to be next for an update right?? ^^^right??
---
It's an art book, but the contents are designed to mimic a Tyrian monthly or quarterly publication (think a very large magazine).
---
Yes, but only available in custom games, which doesn't give you any rewards.
---
Zerker gear is good on Dragonhunter with bow as you can stand back in many of the group fights and just hit for massive damage but you will get wrecked solo with zerker gear in the HOT/Jungle expansion zones unless you are good at dodging and avoiding damage which is hard when dudes swarm you. You can survive if you put all the traps in your skill bar and just spam all 3 of the traps when you get swarmed then back away and just shoot them with arrows. You want to have runes that givey you move speed as well or zerker stats.
---
Guardian is one of the most \*\*flexible\*\* classes to play. You can be a condition-based damage person, a power-based damage person, a tank (using power damage and several invulns you have access to), or a healer. Just remember you can't do everything at once.
---
The easiest is warrior. Warrior's options are damage and damage, and its attack rotations are simple.

I'm confused - it says there's a bundle with all the items in it but I'm not seeing it? Also I can't see where I get the specialty items. Is it cos I'm on mobile?
---
Sadly they tried to make this game too much like WoW instead of making it a true sequel to GW1.
---
I find that if you're farming with someone else then it can be really enjoyable, whether you're running from map to map doing meta's for the amalgated gemstones, or running around in Dragonfall/SW or chopping down trees, it doesn't really matter if you're chatting with someone at the same time :3 
---
That said, I am really lazy and terrible at remembering/looking up event timers so when I am playing alone I don't farm all that much

Easier to use the statues or get it directly.  If I'm opening chests, I don't want something I can readily and easily get that I can't otherwise sell off or use.
---
2019-08-05 but today is 2019-08-06 lads
---
But thats stupid because the daredevil traitline was already in line with the core traitlines. The only gammemode that cares about the steal range is spvp and in spvp you had d/p dash daredevil and s/d core thief BEFORE the nerf. So before the nerf happened 3 core traitlines where just straight up better than daredevil traitline. Now Daredevil is not an option and builddiversity got reduced in a gamemode that is in dire need of builddiversity. Im sure that this was not the intended outcome.
---
There has not been a confirmation yet on this. It will likely be put into ranked as a separate queue with stronghold. This isn‚Äôt the first 2v2 map introduced into guild wars 2 as there were others in the beginning atleast 2 others.
---
Matches like this were part of the core aspect of guild wars 1 pvp so I see it making its way to this ones as well. 
---
pvp is slowly dying without variation to the ranked game mode
---
Depending on the time of the day, it can be hard to find a party of 3-4 waiting to fill for one or two fractals, that's true. I would still check LFG.
---
If you only care about progress, a mix of that, with WvW/PvP dailies, and maintaining a speadsheet with your Achievements/Collections of choice to slowly work on them could be a solution.
---
Play 2 pvp games
---
Another paddle... 
---
Just. Give. Me. A. Sword.
---
It's not becuase of the keys and laws in my country I don't think as we can all see purchase black lion keys from the gem shop right now.
---
Is good to know about some pack not being available to f2p BUT not sure that is the case here.
---
For example some skins mounts show up for us but button to buy is greyed out and there's a warning that "this item require guild wars 2: heart of thorns" or  " this item require guild wars 2: path of fire" but we can still actuall see it in the gem shop.
---
Whats going on here is the PoF Prep Pack is simply absent, would be kind of odd to sell a  "path of fire" preparation pack but then not let people actually buy it because they have only core of f2p accounts?
---
ANet are memeing us!
---
At this point, I feel like it'd be more interesting to create a "core elite spec" - either brand new, or turning one of the pre-existing ones into such - which doesn't require an expansion to use, associate a weapon with it (if new specialization, new weapon; otherwise, an old weapon), give it an effect that boosts the core profession mechanics without altering them like the current elite specializations do, and then make the third trait line forced to using an elite spec.
---
Probably something a lot of folks wouldn't want because further potential constrictions on build set ups (at least for those who don't use elite specs), but I don't think that's so big an issue since 90% of the playerbase restrict themselves to an elite spec anyways.
---
Not really, who cares about the lvl 80 boost leveling is super easy in this game, new players will want this for the unbreakable tools and the 2x bags slot expansion possibly the extra character slot.
---
I don't care if say I cant use such n such till the expansion go on sale but even then wth limit the instant lvl 80 to a shared slot?  Not very bright on anets part tbh.
---
2-5 minute queue, 4 minutes for queue pop + map selection + map prep to finish, ~8 minute match length on average
---
one match in 20 minutes can be optimistic as is :V
---
This is not making me feel happy about the game.
---
Just have us call support and make them manually place players into 2v2 games, problem solved.
---
This is the 3rd 2v2 map added to the game. They haven't done it yet, what makes you think they will now?
---
Asura Arena
---
Notes: This map can only be played on custom games. It is not in the ranked or unranked map selection.
---
Courtyard
---
Hall of the Mists
---
Cool! Can't wait to try it and run into constant fb/scourge combos.
---
I would add a trap too because with zerker gear it usually melt the mobs and help out a lot when many.
---
During the 2v2 tournament we had, this was the predominant build. The other one being thief + mesmer spike one dude or die trying.
---
I do think 2v2 is a step in the right direction. I come from other MMOs where 2v2 is actually supported, and it is fun!
---
A suggestion: Im not so sure about completely cutting out healing, maybe it should be a progressive lowering of healing, say -40% healing, scaling all the way to -90%. Some builds and classes COMPLETELY depend on healing to have ANY survivability (elementalist have the lowest hp, lowest armor in the game, the lowest access to stability which is literally ONE skill, and 2 traits gated behind earth traits, which it would have to replace a damage or a water/arcane trait line, and one trait being gated behind weaver specc, also, we only got 1 skill that provide a short lived 3 ATTACKS, not even seconds of block, which is ignored of course by the plethora of unblockable attacks in the game).
---
Courtyard was the original and was featured in both ranked and unranked game modes of pvp.
---
You should do what ever you want. Set a goal and start working towards it.  
---
Do you want to raid? Start gearing and learning a meta build. Aiming at high tier fractals? Work on ascended + learning fractals. Griffon? Legendary? Etc etc etc.  
---
You don't really need a guild for anything. Guilds serve mostly a social part of the game. It's nicer with a guild, but you don't have to be part of one.  
---
You should basically set your own goals. The game won't tell you what to do.
---
They should also make all core weapons interact with elite spec mechanics. For example, holosmith rifle abilities should scale with heat, and scrapper shield abilities should provide barrier.
---
map completion or a short wvw roaming would fit for 20 mins a day. U might even reach several tiers and get some of those grandmaster shards a week.
---
If you're worried about additional costs, though, why aren't you counting the additional cost you're incurring by salvaging your blues/greens with the Runecrafter? Blues/greens drop a LOT more often than yellow/orange, and if you're using your Rune kit to salvage all of those, you're spending thirty copper *per salvage* instead of only three. That adds up a lot over time.
---
I would 100% rather use a second type of kit than to throw away an entire silver roughly every three and a half salvages or so for the rest of forever.
---
elite specs are not defined by their weapon
---
This. I remember watching a GW2 stream from the devs, and they were saying that UI is extremely complex, and changing one thing have several effects on other systems seemingly unrelated yet somehow affected.
---
For example, when they changed the name of Fire Auras on eles, all traits related and skills suddenly stopped working, for about +2 weeks! I can see they didnt update the name on all skills, but tiny things like that can have game breaking effects, and since almost nobody plays eles in PvP, and most people who play eles on PvE arent paying attention to the game, it went unnoticed for that long.
---
The supposed leaks about build templates that appeared on reddit had a very convoluted UI. Heck, the legendary runes UI is **absolutely awful**, i mean, we already have a great system in PvP, where you can search by name, or even stats, or general words like "healing" or "using a healing ability", or "toughness" or "swap weapon", etc etc.
---
Bunker tempests and druids are pretty hard to kill as a roamer in WvW, but they also have no mobility and deal no damage. It's like dealing with the old prismatic understanding mesmers - just don't fight them and they can't do anything.
---
Weird suggestion - does that weird bit remain if you change other bits of your outfit? I know putting certain shoulders on with other gloves, for example, causes weirdness, or certain helmet/chest piece combinations which have caused character necks to seemingly detach.
---
Private arena and future events
---
The issue with a 20 minute WvW roam is that up to 25% of the roam with be for no rewards.
---
Yes, GW2.
---
if ur into pve metas, you can tag a lot of trash mobs on a scourge and can grind volatile magic, xp and loot easier. I normally equip aoe utilities.
---
I would think condi scourge is better for mob farming since the mobs wont die fast giving other folks a chance to tag them as well.
---
Thank you for the reply, I appreciate it. I guess in reality as you said, it is just a matter of enough people complaining loud enough.     
---
My personal thoughts on the entire matter is I don't like how Anet has loot boxes, but, at the same time I also hate how governments step in. Just not a fan of having the government step in when ever there is something a majority or a vocal minority of people don't like.  
---
I sort of wonder how deep a government can go, if they don't like a game. For instance, games that are subscription based. What if countries start classifying the drops on the killing of a creature as gambling.
---
It's too much work man I just want to jump into it because I don't have a lot of time
---
the 3k dps of a druid in harriers hardly justifies calling them power based.  They are clearly healing based.  They are simply gimped because Anet doesn't want them to have the healing power of a magi druid with the boon support of a harrier druid, so they force them to waste their primary stat on power.
---
80% of the player base doesn't even know there are 2v2 maps because there is no queue...
---
Was going to think it might be intentional, but I noticed there's no such texture on my charr who's now wearing those gloves.
---
I cant preview them on my bank, is there any links I can use to see them on my character?
---
the exact same way you fixed it the first time...
---
I was able to try it with five different human females and the weird texture glitch appears on them all. Strangely enough, my Norn, Sylvari, Charr and Asura do not seem to be affected. Which is totally a first x)
---
Yes.
---
I've thought about this and like the idea in concept, but in reality I don't think it would really work. If they limited a "core" weapon retroactively some classes would be affected much more than others. For example, base engineer has access to only three weapons: pistol, rifle, shield. If you make any of these core you're cutting the core spec's weapon choices by 1/4th.  
---
Some classes would also be affected way more than others depending on which trait line is forced into that "elite" spot. For example with Engineer, if you made Alchemy or Inventions elite then you effectively kill condition engineer builds while also fucking support scrapper builds. Explosives or Tools would negatively affect power DPS elite spec builds in different ways. Explosives would hurt PvE and tools would hurt PvP. If firearms was picked, then all dps variants lose access to the point blank crit chance.  
---
So yeah, on the surface it seems cool, but in reality it'd completely flip the balance of every class on it's head and probably result in worse build diversity overall. In order to not suck, every trait line would probably have to be reworked intelligently which, based on Anet's previous patches, I'm not confident they could do.
---
It's so weird to me how much time they seem to be putting into 2v2 maps when it's not an official game mode (I know it works in hot join, but I wouldn't call that officially supported). I'm sure they take a lot less time to make than conquest maps, but still, it's not like it's nothing. I'm sure these still take a month or so at least.
---
It‚Äôs the theme though. Reaper gets greatsword and scythe in shadow form to represent reaping. Deadeye offers a long range steal (deadeyes mark) since a sniper doesn‚Äôt wanna be close. Druid staffs offer heals so they get an ability that also heals etc. etc.
---
Also, this festival sucks. These glove skins and this awesome Greatsword should have been the pinnacle rewards for playing this useless festival.
---
You don't have to see them as penalties.  
---
Remember the new skills in Necromancer scepter and Guardian hammer that replace old skills when you equip a trait?  
---
If you change those skills, you won't change the core weapon, you only change the differences that go with the trait.   
---
This is the same basic idea.  
---
Giving extra power when you equip a trait, not taking it away.
---
If the weapon has differences when not equipped by the elite spec, it can have tweaks that will affect either separately.
---
If the core changes are too weak, they can be tweaked separately, without affecting the weapon when in the hands of the elite specialization.
---
Daredevil adds a completely new dimension to the Dodge; should Deadeye also have their dodge roll reworked to "be made interesting"?
---
&gt; Realistically if someone with a staff ran at me and swiped me I‚Äôd be on the floor.
---
what if i have daggers and pistols
---
Bruh, I‚Äôm not saying that every instance of every combination ever will fit into the theme, *but* the traits and abilities of an elite spec is often reflected to the weapon that you‚Äôve unlocked.
---
I don't see the new gloves or the greatsword in the store.
---
Interesting. I just tried on a few of my human females and didn't see it.

---
How about bunker mantra firebrand, do those still hit the limit?
---
I'd like to know if the game is ever gonna come out of its pre-2010 level of technology.
---
Core areas are **extremely** easy compared to the rest of the game. Even counting Southsun and S2 maps, there's a big gap between non-expansion and expansion difficulties.
---
Without knowing your full situation it's hard to tell where you're failing. First thing to check is to make sure all your gear is level 80 exotics and that you have worthwhile stat choices (typically people will say Berserker's (power) or Viper's (condi) but there are other viable options too, esp. for non-hardcore content; if you are power and keep having issues, I'd go Maurader's; if you're condi and need survivability, I'd use a viper/carrion or viper/trailblazer mix).
---
Most of the time, I find folks who are "just entering expansion areas" and having a hard time, is because their gear isn't up to snuff, and they're used to the very slow and weak attacks of the core game.
---
Naturally, awareness and having an idea of how certain enemies' skills function is always a benefit.
---
Ok that‚Äôs really good.
---
I've been playing for months and I only just noticed the "consume whole stack" and "salvage all of x rarity" options last night. RIP.
---
You get no rewards until your next full 5 min tick. So, if you join right after a tick, you get no rewards for the next tick.
---
For some reason I feel like Journey Through Caledon could do with an epic orchestra remake - maybe give that a look? :P
---
Yeah, overall I'm more inclined to "make a new core elite spec" rather than "convert a core spec to a core elite spec". And I'd only really consider limiting a core weapon to the new elite spec for those with the highest amount - like warrior - just to reduce the time it'll be until they run out of weapons.
---
Of course, I'd also be unopposed to every specialization line getting a look over, as I feel that things could be simplified without reducing build diversity a bit.
---
I can actually burst those down as a holosmith, for some reason. Maybe I've only met bad firebrands.
---
I personally find it a lot easier to learn the boss mechanics and once you get it down, just stare at your skill bar + casting bar the entire time. Just use your peripheral vision to deal with the mechanics. I main one class, but with so much visual clutter, I find it impossible to just look at your character animation to determine when I've finished my auto chain (also randomly having no quickness can throw you off).
---
I think 3v3 might work better; that's what BDO has and a ton of different comps are seen. The issue with that is that it would still ultimately amount to a FB + Scourge and probably a power class with tons of spike damage like Rev, Mantra Mes, Reaper, maybe Deadeye. Or perhaps just a second scourge. The overarching issue is that PoF really morphed the meta and class interaction. 
---
Firebrand's healing is alright. It's not amazingly powerful and really not why they're regarded as the best support class. They just have access, easy access, to boons. They shit out aegis, condi-convert, and have a pulsing resistance field. Tempest support can condi-cleanse (and convert if you spec it, i suppose), give moderate amounts of boons and heal well but they fall short to FB's variety of boons and utility. In summation, healing isn't really that big of a problem; otherwise, we'd see scrapper and tempest supports. It's boons that are the more glaring issue. 
---
As for Eles, my personal opinion is that weaver is un-interactive, making them really strong. They start their heal/sustain rotation and there's nothing you can do to stop it because they have way too many dodge/invincibility frames. Weavers aren't really any good in any 2v2 but as sidenoders, they're among the best, and potentially the best with CI being disabled for Mesmers. I actually think Weaver should be toned down. 
---
Other builds like burst Scepter/Focus for base ele or Weaver are exactly as they need to be. They're glass-cannon builds that really punish people that aren't ready for their impending burst and can also be punished if they make a mistake. Weaver is less punishable but still punishable since they really have to commit to their sustain skills.
---
Alchemy Art Group are the same people who made Tyrian Tarot (you may remember them as the GW2 Artist Collective) and generally fantastic people.
---
Tyrian Tarot and the Wintersday Zine were both [absolutely](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9e375z/wow_hats_off_to_the_gw2_artists_collectivetyrian/) [gorgeous](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9pnjem/the_tyrian_tarot_is_amazing_and_the_gw2_artists/) - even my non-GW2 friends loved them. Fantastic people to support, fantastic gift, and you absolutely should get a copy for yourself at the very least. 
---
Not affiliated with them in any way, just a fan, but I could not give higher praise. I've purchased a good number of fan-made work in multiple universes (including much larger ones eg: the warcraft universe) and nothing comes close to their quality.
---
Could not agree more. The player made arenas have never been alive, anyone can see that. If you add a 2v2 arena without a queue its just an absolute waste of resources. Doesnt take a genius to figure that out.
---
There are 7 years of suggestions for content, 2v2 included, that have never been implemented and at this point almost certainly never will. PvP is handled by how many devs? Two? Three? Dont bother expecting anything.
---
I will try this again.
---
It is phenomenally to put an item in a pack that could block sales due to some asinine requirement like the said item needs to go in s shared slot.
---
Quick thinking here..eh dunno... maybe make it account bound so you can stick this thing in your bank so any character you create can get it and use it to go poof lvl 80?
---
As for the extra character slot not letting f2p account buy it is also..eh duh...as I dunno they would be prime targets for this item...why only sell these to people with core or expansions on their accounts ..it's beyond stupid.
---
Don't get me wrong I really enjoy the game and open world, I played and own all of GW 1 but I haven't seen this amount of stupid in a long time in game with f2p option barring perhaps swtor.....
---
Are there any updated class guide on which class does what (i.e better at tanking, or long range, etc)? I'm nto entirely sure how the classes work, but I am an avid ffxiv player so I would assume they would be somewhat close(tank,DPS,healer). But again, not entirely sure
---
We actually still can tuck people into the backend. Feel free to PM me if that interests you. \^\^
---
I noticed that you seemed to like spirit weapons.
---
If you're considering another class to play. I'd recommend  Necromancer and the Reaper specialization for your play style and skill level. 
---
It's much easier to play and do well at the same time for the level of content you're doing. You have two healthbars and do a great amount of damage just auto attacking and tanking with a second health bar. 
---
You can also have a minion army that'll help you a lot if you can't personally do well. The AIs will help you.
---
I don't have open world/story PvE footage, but here's some Reaper footage in WvW that gives you an idea of the damage you can easily do in open world/story PvE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KUPsX9YPdg
---
Yeah I miss the old steal even if it wasn't unblockable. Still used to that old range when playing DD
---
I'm pretty sure to buy the pack you need to own the Path of Fire expansion. Just to make sure - The Path of Fire Preparation Pack DOES NOT include the expansion.
---
So exited! I‚Äôve gotten the tarot and all the winterday zines! Along with guildmag (I don‚Äôt know if this is the same people as guildmag tho) The quality is amazing on the artist collective ones and are some of my all time favorite fan zines &lt;3
---
awesome &lt;3

It hasn't accepted PayPal for a few years now! We host the WDZ on our normal stores, so you might be thinking of that, but TT was the same as this. However, if you can only use PayPal, we usually try to reserve a few copies to put in a post-campaign store. Feel free to message an email over to [gw2collective@gmail.com](mailto:gw2collective@gmail.com) and I can add you to the notification list for those!
---
after 2 minutes... so you cant afk for 2 hours until your enemy gives up and leaves
---
Gemstore already sucks my wallet dry, and I am kinda tired of games that always get expanded and demand new purchases. I am trying to lean more towards oldschool singleplayer games. But I'd appreciate the artworks from afar, I guess.
---
Just curious if any still exist
---
GW2 uses a soft-trinity system, rather than the hard-trinity you find in WoW and FFXIV. 
---
That means that no single class is restricted to the role of tank, healer, or dps, and each class can spec into filling different roles, with some classes filling a role much better. This means though that, with just a gear and passive (traits) swap, the same class that's playing a healer one moment can switch completely to DPS the next.
---
I'm assuming you mean PvE, since from what I've heard, FFXIV's PvP system isn't really anything special, so probably not really what you're looking for.
---
In that case, you should look at discretize for fractal builds (pretty much 5-man dungeons for level 80, shorter than a dungeon but often done in sets.), and snowcrows for raid builds (10-man)
---
I believe snowcrows is up to date with the latest patch, but I can't say for certain that discretize is up to date yet.
---
Outside of fractals and raids, healing and tanking isn't, because every class has some level of self-sustain ability. Also, tanking is...a little weird in this game because everything in high level content hits like a truck, even with maxed out defenses, so facetanking is generally a pretty poor idea, and aggro mechanics aren't super well specified in most instances outside of raids.
---
How about nowadays with your firebrand?
---
You think HoT was hardcore? You really don't know what you're talking about.
---
I will leave you do your delusions, have a nice day.
---
:)

The Chinese
---
i don't really understand ther add on system, it's not in the rewards?
---
the climb can take about 20 mins if you havent done it before and have fully mastered griffon and skyscale. took me a half hour because after getting up to the first level of tops i had trouble finding higher ones in the storm and branches. i did it using the skyscale to scale up as high as i can, and then leap of faith into gliding into griffon to maintain the height gain from the skyscale while the skills recharge to get back on the skyscale. i havent figured out why, but sometimes the skyscale would fill up with red bar like normal from going too high, and using the vigor skill would work but the actual jump i got from it would instantly drop which i figured was because of being at max red bar, so it only give me a little jump and i had to cling really fast to not lose height from doing this. other times (i think it might have had something to do with leaping off a mount and landing on the tilted side of the trees having some influence on what the skyscale registers as the new starting spot but im not certain about that) it would actually mount up without as much of the red bar as i expected to be there, and its by repeating that behavior with the red bar that allowed me to get to the top.
---
Thanks a lot. And yeah, I was looking for more over based content, like you said , the PvP in FFXIV is pretty poor. 
---
But thanks for this, it does help a lot and it is pretty refreshing to hear that any class can do a lot depending on the players preference. I heard that this is a fun casual themed game where if I want to go hardcore, I can, and if I want to play here and there, I can with little to no penalties. Would that be true as well?
---
Im confused... Is there some passive stealth?
---
I'd say do the dailies for the first break, blood rubies and winter berries or something like that for the others. The dailies give 2 gold and 10 AP for between 10-20 minutes play time.
---
The map looks stunning.
---
Wait, am I misundestanding? The $65 pin tier doesn't offer the original item the kickstarter's for?
---
Sounds great to me!
---
what if... each LS episode is basically a mini expansion so technically we get 6 expansions :V
---
I agree 100%. I do this all the time which is one reason why I can never hit top tier. I'll always do decent dps but interrupting my aa is the worst flaw I have. Its also harder because in the middle of a boss fight, with all the other players and animations and effects, it's hard to see YOUR character.
---
Gemstore stuff is always account bound, you can't trade it.
---
That sounds interesting. Can you give an example?
---
Honestly add it to ranked. The pvp playerbase is so tiny that having as many teams as possible seems like the best option. Might kill conquest though
---
Going from zerker to marauder as a guardian gives you ~65% more health (but less with exotic, but not much). This is a hell of a lot more than one extra hit, and even a small buffer often means the difference between eating dirt instantly or having time to react. You lose about 7% damage. For anything other than raids and speedruns, this is more than a worthwhile tradeoff, especially if you are already dying a bunch.
---
Even in the context of trying to do fractals/dungeons as quickly as possible, my experience with this game all the way back from week 1 is this:
---
The best groups are obviously the ones who completely know their shit and run zerk. The vast majority of players will never belong to this category. 
---
In the middle you have groups of people who are running with more survivable builds/gear that they're comfortable with. It's a massive negative difference compared to the above, but it usually pans out okay. 
---
Then at the very bottom you have groups with unskilled players running full zerk who get downed every 10 seconds. It is an absolute nightmare. Then use this gear because this community is obsessed with the perfect min-max under 100% ideal scenarios and perfect play which simply does not reflect reality or most of the playerbase.
---
&gt;even as a healer I couldn't stand up to that much focused pressure all the time.
---
This is why it's always better to go for mobility and damage rather than sustain as a WvW roamer. No amount of tankiness will let you survive a 5 man gank squad. Burst damage and mobility let's you reset fights until you have the advantage.
---
I think this might also be why bunker firebrands felt easier to kill. They have even less mobility than tempests and druids, so as a Holo I'm just doing my PvE rotation the entire fight.
---
Mmmmmm.... Proof Pudding.... ü§§
