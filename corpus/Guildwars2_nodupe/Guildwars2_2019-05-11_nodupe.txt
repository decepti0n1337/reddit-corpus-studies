Some at FE linked 155 bonus boxes...and this just under 40 hours into the event. That's a lot of work and very little sleep for 155 silver ore.
---
Eh, its a bit of a stretch but I see what you mean.
---

---
The skyscale as a whole doesn't seem very useful to me. I can't imagine anything you can do with a skyscale that you can't already with a springer, a grifon and faithleap.
---
ArenaNet: Allied forces suffered massive casualties in the battle.
---
Guild Wars 2: -literally no known named NPCs died-
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Just like when the Pact Fleet fell!
---
^(Before you mention Eir and Trahearne, they died after the Fleet's destruction.)
---
For Fractals get Diviner Trinkets and Diviner Weapons with Sigill of Concentration. Use Rune of the Pack on your Berserker Set instead of Sholar. Use Buffood and slot your equip with +9AR in every item. This way you get 100% Boonduration relatively cheap and Pack rune is way more usefull than Sholar on Chronomancer Support.
---
Chrono Support only deals like 15k burst dps to begin with, if you add 5% from Sholar thats nothing and its better for your team if you can keep up some Might and perma Fury on all Bosses. I'm really no fan of Sholar on Supporter classes tbh.
---
For Raids you can't cheap out and dupe around with Boonduration from potions through  Infusions like in Fractals, you need to get Diviner gear too and thats kind of expensive.
---
Diviner set is worth it! If you get Trinkets and Weapons you can allmost also play a Renegade Support in Fractals too since you'll use the same Weapons and just need another Sword and Staff.
---
If you go for Assassins gear thats only really usefull if you have both a Warrior and Druid for Banner and Spotter buff, you can do that if you have premades you run with everyday - if you pug I'd not bother.
---
Thanatologist Mystic 🤔
---
Any of the zzzzz tanky infinite sustain builds. That probably means something like boonbeast, sword weaver, holo, scrapper, or just full aids scourge. In the old days condi reaper would have been top of the list too but that's been nerfed back into sanity (it would probably work fine still, just with a lot less damage).
---
Occasionally yes
---
WBs were never my favorite thing to do consistently, but it was sometimes fun to just pop in to do a specific one in my down time, mostly teq or jormag. 
---
But even with the bonus rewards and the crowds of people, I don't like doing WB trains
---
SWEEET!
---
Ah yes my friend just forged some clovers last night. Believe he got some juicy gossamer scraps back.
---
I still miss the old VA. It was so much better. So much more charr-like in my eyes.
---
The problem is that I'm broke and swapping stats in the forge costs a lot. I already got the beetle today, but taking it slowly with re-gearing. All my gear is outdated for raiding and fractals, except for my guardian.
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
Duuuude i thought sidekick has died, so glad to see it back in action! Love the neat menu it has.
---
Main reason i unintalled it because it took days to sync stuff properly. Maybe it was on my end but eh, will try it again
---
So I’d need an alt to find another instance with access to different nodes?
---
Omfg. Just when I think I can't love the damn game any more. Awesome sauce!
---
I feel like I did enough clicking past the headline and watching the video. Reading is emotional labour.
---
Yeah that makes sense, reading that I start to believe it is much more likely, Aurene, or another entity, will play a role in the next ep. If they do bring back aurene, it better be in a believable and cool way.
---
It just seems to bring the best out of everyone, I'll maybe give it a few years before I go anywhere near it tho!!!
---
Holosmith Pros: Good damage, excellent cleave, welcome in fractals/raids if you want to graduate from dungeons to those (it's not top meta but it's perfectly fine), good in PvP, very flashy (if you like that sort of thing)  
---
Holosmith Cons: Rifle/kits rotation is very difficult for some people and takes a lot of practice to get right/efficient
---
Scrapper Pros: High sustain, fairly easy to play, fun animations, very strong in PvP right now, can be built as a healer if you're into that and have groupmates/friends who are understanding and open to that sort of thing  
---
Scrapper Cons: Highly unwelcome in most fractal/raid groups -- to the point that if you're going to play it in PVE you should expect to only use it in Open World most of the time, if you play it in PvP people will occasionally get super salty and occasionally downright toxic to you (moreseo than PvP usually brings, I mean)
---
I've seen people take down tower walls with them pretty easy. I am not sure on exact damage, but they seemed comparable to a regular cata (not superior) in terms of damage. They don't hit as hard, but they have a much shorter cool down then other siege. Decent amount of damage for mobile siege, but they are tough to get. 
---
You can only get dune rollers after holding a camp for 10 minutes then applying a tactic that takes 2 minutes to take effect. They have a 20 minute cool down to get another, which would require holding the camp for that much longer. I have ridden around in the dune rollers before, and if you get out they poof completely. They don't stick around like golems.
---
Sorry but it is the truth. There is a related thread on the forum about maybe an exploit with the roller. I will link it later when I am not on mobile.
---
Ok thanks, PvP scrapper looks fun
---
Dune Roller damage affected by pilot stats and can be buffed (quickness, might, etc). Thats it, I believe.
---
81 here. 125 my goal (250 is waay too much).
---
Our government is never going to do anything that goes against business (no matter which party is in control). Their concern over the matter is fake and it will never go anywhere. 
---
While video game publishers may not be the most powerful lobbyists it's still a lot better than the anti-gambling lobbyists which probably don't exist, at least not with enough donations to politicians to matter.
---
There's probably a few multi-loots in that number, if you get enough participation on another map instance you get it again.
---
So my question, what, if anything, would you change on the reaper after all this.
---
Both sylvari voices are absolutely amazing. I hope we get to keep them forever.
---
Underrated movie
---
If anything this would be Mordremoth fruit.
---
I will take a video of it and post it. It seems there are no videos of it anywhere.
---
Leveling up a mastery requires both the XP and the points. You’re done with the XP part for that one, you just need to get two points either by completing achievements or finding the channeled ones out in the world.
---
You need to fill the exp bar first AND THEN you can spend the mastery points. As Eel said: all are none. You have 3 at the moment and you'll need 5. So 2 more. And there's different kinds of mastery points. Tyria, HoT and PoF. You can only spend these points in their respective categories.
---
AH ok that makes sense. thank you
---
Your 3 mastery points are not spent right now, the game simply tells you that you need 2 more points before having the required amount (5) then you will be able to spend those 5 points to learn the mastery
---
by getting two more mastery points?!
---
as eel already said: you need 5 core tyria mastery points, yet you only have 3. that is your entire problem.
---
What you have there is a screen telling you that you need 5 Mastery Points to unlock the current Mastery. It shows that you have three of the five already. You can see the number 3 at the top right, and three of the five Mastery icons are lit up to indicate you have those points ready. There are still two Mastery icons not lit up. That means you're missing two more Mastery points. Get those, and then click the little lock icon.
---
My warrior is called Jabba the Headbutt, and my rev is known as Flash Nordon (my reddit name is also my main's name).
---
Please don't waste Support's time with this.
---
Its Sayida's blanket, from the Suns Refuge nest collection... that she never got to use
---
Its the wolf head on his shoulder that takes the spotlight too, very awkward
---
What do you get with the pro version over the free?  I see you can remove ads for $1.49 or upgrade to the pro for $4...but don't see what you get for the $4
---
Aren't Aurene's brand crystals blue?
---
That's not how it works. Filling the xp bar only allows you to spend Mastery Points for that track level. 
---
In this case it is telling you that you still need 2 more Mastery points to purchase that level of Mastery. You have 3(highlighted) out of 5 needed. When you'll have 5 you'll spend them all to "buy" that tier. The highlighted ones are NOT already spent, so to speak, but only a "preview" of sort.
---
You can gain more via achievements and exploration.
---
Wait! Was that that really the same actress from the base game during the post launch content?! What happened?!
---
 Awakened Yellow + Aurene Blue = Undead Green. That kind of logic
---
what settings are you running on? I have a 7820x on 4.8 and a 1080ti @ 1440p and struggle to keep 60 even in low pop areas like the treasure rooms in thunderhead
---
That's quality content
---
$6.99
---
IT wasn't needed but it appeared explicitly during Blish's experiments which was featured in the story and  it was openly advertised. Again, if a mount is required for story OR it was openly advertised, it's definitely not going to be behind a huge paywell.
---
You could argue that the Requiem Armor was behind a huge paywall, but that was mainly because of market manipulation but we're talking mainly about mounts.
---
Last two is intense
---
"legally" and "doing it anyway because they can get away with it" are two quite different things.
---
oh man this is wild because that's basically the cosplay of him I've been rocking for years. awesome to see that great minds think alike!! great work, I've been struggling to find a staff that works right for his crook. Closest I found that I felt matched was Nevermore, for the shape and the animated winds.
---
Sadly we heard nothing new from the devs, and a mod closed the merged forum thread because people were asking for an answer :/
---
Isnt it highly subjective, making the guide pointless? Not to mention exclusive choices with total makeover kit.
---
And 5 character slots on the core account.
---
The pro features are minimal and mainly just quality of life things.  Some things include sorting your inventories, hiding checklist items that you don't plan on completing, changing color schemes and the placement of menu buttons, etc. 
---
No major features will ever require Sidekick Pro. It was designed as just a way to help out my big supporters and give them a little extra fun features :)
---
Hopefully this helps! More info is on this page as well: https://www.reddit.com/r/gw2sidekick/comments/4ywupq/sidekick_pro/
---
Also, become a trading post tycoon, mentor new players, or develop altoholism.
---
Wonder if you could do a sandman cosplay from the same movie
---
NOT DEAD Pog
---
You should buy the art book, great look into the lore of the movie. 
---
And the books they’re based off aren’t that bad either.
---
Crazy, I saw you a bunch yesterday during the World Boss Rush event. Looks good man!
---
I love my Necro, I have zero regrets playing him.
---
It came out around the same time as The Avengers. It didn't stand a chance.
---
Stat swapping can take a while for sure, I had just meant to point out that it's easier than to craft all new gear. Good luck with everything, hope you enjoy getting back into the game! :)
---
You can farm on alts , if they enter the same instance , the nodes will be in the same places as for your other characters. But there is a daily cap that sets in , once you hit that , the nodes disappear. For all characters.
---
I love GW2 for the horizontal progression and left WoW largely because I hated the rush to end game vertical progression.
---
I was expecting a different Jack Frost hee ho. Still great though.
---
And like I said in my other comment, what is stopping a mists map from appearing on the world map at this point in the story, the mists "invading" onto Tyria is already happening.
---
Do we know each other lol. 😆
---
Tell mw if you got something rare out of tjem
---
On one hand, that would be a good suggestion and the Pale Tree truly become something more awesome. On the other hand, that much power could potentially corrupt her, sorta like Lady Galadriel when Frodo offer her the one ring in LOTR. This could lead to more complication if her new power branch out to all the Sylvari races;  they become blue-ish like Caithe would be kinda cool, or suddenly acting like the corrupted Sylvari (instead of Modremoth, Mother is speaking in their head) and  acting crazy (like corrupted Sylvari when the Pact attacked Maguuma).  
---
Wouldn't it be a twist though, the Pale Tree become the big bad, and we have to get help from the Nightmare Court?
---
Keeps are not hard to solo assuming no enemy player comes to defend it.
---
I am not doing them even now. Rewards are too bad.
---
Climb cliffs for one.
---
Griffons need a wide open space to gain height, as well as the faithleap mastery. And even then it's fairly tricky to actually gain height as opposed to merely maintain height.
---
Springer needs ledges large enough to land on.
---
Skyscale can climb vertical walls in small areas. And with the rift mastery which was said to be added to every map, they can gain heights with more direct ease than griffon without a cliff.
---
imo just buy gen 1 legendaries straight from the tp, their old anyway alot more people have those than gen 2. you cant do that with gen 2 legendaries so u craft those instead.
---

Such a gorgeous film, would highly recommend it to anyone who loves beautiful animation
---
It's called Rise of the Guardians
---
That color also matches the Desert King sets. Especially the color of the flames for the torch and throne brazier.
---
Besides the prospective future of wherever on the world map that "Mists zone" gets placed utterly ruining the potential to go to that spot in the world?
---
The design of the map we've seen thus far.
---
Dragon - A dragon is a large, serpent-like legendary creature that appears in the folklore of many cultures around the world. 
---
Fruit -  seed-bearing structure in flowering plants  formed from the ovary after flowering. 
---
Red Meat -  meat that is red when raw, for example beef or lamb. 
---
i never knew fruits can have red meat
---
Y'know. I actually prefer Mara Junot. Her VO (at least from the preview) seems a little smoother and more natural sounding.
---
For that same reason, I'm still missing Ron Yuan. I find Lex Lang kinda over-enunciates, though he does seem to get better with every patch, and I certainly wouldn't say he does a bad job overall.
---
Included in the video appears to be a completed voice sample to.
---
https://youtu.be/sY6fizs0e0A?t=118
---
Honestly I think the change might be less jarring than Rox's voice change... But... newer charr voice-overs seem to be getting more and more processed, somewhat homogenizing them... I sewer that the processing already got tuned on post HOT lines for the female charr anyways.
---
The charr voice filters seems to like to distort lower frequency sounds more, but the original VAs voice was always a bit light on the low frequencies keeping the distortion lighter than most other charr.
---
Gah, with Sylvari being Awakened that means it's not Dragon Corruption, but what the heck is it? Aren't the Dragon's Primortial and therefore would encompass ALL types of magic? Who would suck up Awakening?---Maybe Awakening -isn't- magic...
---
if she was capable of consuming magic like a dragon I think she'd have picked up some new magic from Zhaitan's &amp; Mordremoth's deaths wouldn't she?
---
The Grove's [Location](https://i.imgur.com/I4E2x1y.jpg) is similar in distance to Zhaitan &amp; Mordremoth's locations.
---
Seen you in game! Love it
---
i remember 1 Dev was riding a wyvern the size of the Matriarch in Verdant Brink in 1 of the guild chat stream months ago and he was in queensdale but obviously using the Dev server.
---
Is there a good way to boost reward track gain ? I have have dozens different exp boosters that include WVW track gain, but can they be used at the same time or extended (like you can with utility and food primer) ?
---
they should be our allies.
---
Fair point. Unless creatures of that size can choose to not absorb stuff.
---
I rather like the name Havok, (I use it for my asura thief.)
---
Compared to other games (I came from FFXIV), telegraphs are shorter and faster, AOE circles are more frequent, and you can't really face tank hits the way you can in other games.
---
Tempest (elementalist) is the lightest armor class with the lowest bass health, so you've picked one of the least forgiving classes for missing mechanics. If you aren't sinking any points into vitality or toughness you're making it even harder on yourself.
---
Try a mix of Marauder/soldier gear instead of pure Berserker, or feel free to try other classes (every single one is more forgiving).  Also bring fractal potions and/or a dedicated healer, both help a lot! 
---
Do you play staff, dagger, or scepter tempest?
---
&gt; For example:
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; * Professor
---
&gt; * Doctor
---
&gt; * Director
---
&gt; * ...
---
My asura has a "Nekomancer" title, shamelessly stolen from [Monstress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monstress_(comics).
---
&gt;No way I'm paying real money for an instrument in the current situation.
---
You should keep in mind that in the current situation, instruments still work as intended. The bug just affect the macros (as if a gear update causes arcDPS' buildtemplate issues), but the instrument themselves still work like they have to work. 
---
So you still get what you pay for.
---
Probably an api thing or a change how things are calculated
---
I would only recommend gold+ do it tbh. I'm plat and made it probably a month past the optimal time because I didn't cap some weeks and even still it took a good while. I can't imagine having to play as much as it would take to cap weekly pips as anything below gold. In plat you can cap pretty easily just playing the weekend after reset or off and on through the week.
---
Happened to everyone that day, iirc it was a bug of some sort.
---
Medium wvw legendary looks way better than pve medium imo but really we just want it for tons of build/rune swapping. Finally, I don't have to carry multiple sets on me to roam and to zerg.
---
As others have said: [reward track modifiers](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/WvW_Reward_Track#Reward_track_modifiers)
---
Food and utility overwrite the currently active buff while other buffs (like the [celebration bonus](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Celebration_Bonus)) of the same kind stack in duration up to a cap (should max out at 7 days).
---
Oh boy, this spam again. Is it that time of year
---
From time to time when I see new players just starting out I’ll give them a care package of some 15slot bags and some gold to get them started. It’s hard getting into a game with no bag space. At the start you want to keep everything cause you don’t know what’s good or bad ;) 
---
This is one great community of helpful and kind players. Hopefully lots of people continue to help out newer players :)
---
I saw you in game 2 days ago! amazing tbh
---
To anyone that is new, best thing to do is with the last daily reward chest is to select the Chest of Legendary crafting mats. This will give you Mystic Clovers while you either take your time making the weapon or are figuring out which one you want to make.
---
Who thought that starter human female light thing was  a good idea? Oh wait, 99% of endgame fashion + 10 infusions and permafrost spam.
---
Unfortunately it is a matter of practice
---
Try zooming your camera out as far as possible, to get a good view of the environment. Don't use your dodges to get out of AOEs that you can run out of. It is largely a matter of learning the mechanics of each fractal, but there's only a few that are AOE hell (twilight oasis, molten furnace firestorm phase, etc), while the rest are reasonable if you can just get a good view of the field.
---
Maybe watch some videos of other people playing the fractals, see how they avoid AOEs
---
T3 Cultural.  Cost gold though
---
Honestly why the random crystals. They could have done such a good job with a nice "well crafted" piece of crystal armor that integrated crystals instead of the old 500000x done over spiky spiky random shit.
---
Surviving branding TWICE?! Kill her! She's a dragon minion serving a different dragon!
---
I didnt know Tom from myspace played.
---
or they like the game just fine
---
I think it’s on sale for 14€ for those that already own Path of Fire but not Heart of Thorns. 
---
A buddy of mine who recently returned only got the option to buy the Path of Fire expansion on the website for 29€, even tho a combined collection is available (should probably promote that instead). But when he logged in, he got the offer for HoT for 14€.
---
Hm I wonder how much my account is worth.

It was covered in pretty good detail in one of the GW2 novels as well.

Not necessarily. She was unconscious for the better part of the time to get that magic. And if she did get a chunk of Mordremoth's magic, we wouldn't see a difference beyond power levels since she's already connected to the same domain as Mordremoth.
---
There's also no doubt the fact that one must actively consume that magic (as we see with Kralk and Aurene at the end of PoF, and the fact that Primordus had to move to the Ring of Fire islands to be able to get that juicy magic). She may have chosen not to consume Zhaitan's magic.
---
We're not sure whether any dragon champion can usurp an Elder Dragon, or if it must be a \*dragon\* and on top of that, a "high dragon" (as opposed to the more common lesser dragons like Skyscales and wyverns). It's possible, given that they absorb magic too, but ultimately unproven.
---
That said, the Pale Tree replacing Mordremoth has been a long standing theory. But it's been left in the realms of "can neither be proven or disproven to be possible"
---
No, the player has too much voice acting. ESO has voice choice because it's for combat and emotes, but as far as I've played your character didn't speak during dialogue.
---
That's what I said. Aurene pulled a Captain Ginyu during that branding
---
Should there be? Eh.
---
Would it be nice to have? Yeah, sure.
---
I haven't actually played since Guild Wars 1, how should I start out as a new player? I'm currently using base game only, so I don't have max level boosts, I want to learn the system naturally rather then quickly. 
---
I usually prefer dot builds but I also like good burst, or a hybrid of the two.
---
Absolutely. If you don’t have the waypoints unlocked you might want to get the World Boss Portal (on sale atm) or bring some teleports to a friend.

I never understood those guides. We have a totally fine website that shows materials, crafting order, includes precursor crafting and also shows our materials and gives us shopping list.
---
As far as I know, you cannot purchase expansions in game. Are you referring to the "HoT Digital Deluxe Upgrade"? That's like a character slot and a mini, not the expansion.
---
Joko revives in Aurene's weakened body/mind, and they swap consciousness who gets control of the body.

I used to do this to new players. I was starting in new zones with my ultra high level character with  legendary weapons etc and doing the ultimate show off. Once in a while I would  help a player that asked for help or if note then I would stalk a new player around the map and help him for 20-30 min to understand what is happening, then I would send him a gold to start off wishing him the best. 
---
It's because I wanted that unwanted-then help to me when I was new and I didn't get it so I started doing it in hope to make someone's day.
---
We must meet!! Which server are you playing
---
You can see me?? 😱

Thank you!! 😁

Thank you!! Do say hi 😁😁😁

Yes its due time for more hairstyles!!
---
I think the correct question is, are they here to stay or should they be scrapped. The answer is, they should stay. People who've enjoyed them will keep doing them, those who are tired of rares and know how to make gold more effectively will do so.
---
It's meh but extras for those who want to chance and its also going to drop some prices for the ridic expensive things.
---
I've returned to the game to find my Account completely empty (Gold, Mats and even some of my chars are gone). So I have to start from scratch. Would like to play a healer/supporter in the later stages of the game, but read that it's relatively difficult to gear for it right of the bat. Narrowed it down to Rev, Guard, Ranger. - Which of those have the easier time transitioning from a Power Build (Read they are easiest to build towards) to a Healing Build?
---
idk guess im a journalist
---
Short answer: better parenting

To prolong the story, primordus and jormag should clash for the meal

They could up the stakes by having kralk move towards Rata Sum or the grove. This would force us and the pact to act quickly.

I think the bug is only about octave switch skills responding with more delay. Dunno if we can fix that by adding a bit more delay to macros after octave switches. I didn't notice any other problem with notes. (harp)

@/u/jpredd looks like you deleted your comment before I could respond but I'll reply anyways.
---
So I assume you mean for legendary armor. It will depend a little on what type you want and the collection does give you the precursors for "free" but crafting a full heavy set from scratch would be [~2400g](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/calculator/a~0!b~1!c~0!d~1-80384;1-80435;1-80254;1-80205;1-80277;1-80557). You save ~100g since you get the precursors already from the second collection. I'd say the more important thing for most players when finishing the collection is that you get a full ascended armor set from the first collection and another full set of ascended precursor armor from the second. Both sets are fully stat selectable too so you can get harder sets like harrier or diviner without needing to craft them.

the head of the mount looks kinda strange ;)
---
Sorry someone else answered it in a later comment (which I read after typing this out) so I didn't want to waste your time hence I deleted it.
---
Lit, do you have any plans to get an edge over Pale Tree and Toolkit? All 3 apps are super similar just with Pale Tree and Toolkit using a more modern UI
---
Gotat try that, I have a Charr engi but never play Engi so I haven#t really noticed those yet. Thanks!
---
No extraordinary powers? She created the Dream to ward the hypermajority of her sylvari children from the corruption of Mordremoth.
---
I'd disagree. Aside from Gates of Maguuma, the fact that Jormag's tooth is in a snowy area, and Primordus' awakening / a volcano about to erupt is in a place called the Fire Islands is more of a coincidence that was built before the episode titles were devised.
---
I also never said it was an impossibility. Just that based on pure empirical evidence about what the names of Season 3 and Season 4 episode titles have been about (even 7 out of 8 Season 2 episode titles too, for that matter), the chances of War Eternal being about the Fissure of Woe, where there is no longer an 'eternal war' or even Eternals and thus nothing "eternal" about it anymore, is very unlikely. Especially since the trailer had explicitly dubbed the episode's title out of the "Book of Balthazar".
---
It's already been made a reference to Balthazar's teachings, and perhaps it will become a reference to the events that we're going to see come Tuesday. Adding arbitrary location of a story instance on top of that seems exceptionally unlikely.
---
use the ingame "/wiki" command to find out about all the items in your bags! 
---
(type /wiki in chat and then shift+right-click the item in your inventory)
---
The only thing like that I've seen is they said they wouldn't tie all legendary trinkets to living story.
---
WvW T3 armor costs no gems.
---
&gt; Guess I'm just a hoarder
---
No, you're a Skritt.
---
Yea, I was this way when I first started.
---
Unfortunately, most stuff in this game is just vendor trash or salvageable trash.. very few items are actually worth hanging onto (and they usually state their use in the item's description).  You may realize this in time when your bank, main, and alt's inventories are all full and you have no choice but to filter through because you've already spent $50 on extended bank space.
---
There's a reason this game is often called Inventory Wars.
---
Around 42gb actually :)
---
We're going full Endgame in this episode I can see that already to fix our dragon up. Also as some other post already pointed out the war between Menzies and Balthazars army in the Fissure of Woe was called "Eternal War" so locking Kralkatorrik into some kind of timeloop or similar doesn't seem to far fetched since we can't just destroy him without messing up Tyria in the process.
---
That's an amazing community I wonder if this happens in many MMOs too.
---
Whispers" hail hydra the seabubbles
---
I’ve been running a water/earth aura tempest in PVP mainly for fun, but it has been doing better than expected. 
---
It’s got some decent survivability but since it’s tough to compete with Firebrand and Scrapper for a support slot, I’ve adjusted my build a bit for some extra mobility.
---
Rune of Radiance, Harrier Amulet, Sigil of Energy &amp; Doom.
---
Although I prefer the offhand Dagger from what I can tell most people are on focus.
---
Dagger 4 on wind attunement just feels too broken mobility-wise for me to not use it in PVP. 
---
I doubt it’s anywhere near as good in high level play but in gold it’s fairly important to be able to cap/decap quickly if your team insists on running headstrong into 1v2 or worse situations.
---
Running the water, earth, and ultimate aura shouts. 
---
I’ve toyed around with a few other skills in the last slot, but haven’t settled on anything.
---
I just played 1st time in fractals yesterday and i had around 85 I think. I had this build https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/revenant/renegade/alacrity/ this is an build with no so bad dps important read the whole Rotation section and use order from above always of cd. With this build you will have 100% uptime of alec but as healer you need fb for quickness. There is an other bild of rev healer withe 100% alec and might and good healing but you will need an quickbrand condi or power https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/revenant/renegade/heal/
---
And she somehow finds a part of Snaff’s consciousness floating around in there, they combine forces and completely assimilate Kralky’s mind
---
There’s this really cool necromantic asura event on metrics province to do with golems imbued with dead magics, elite specs please
---
The content tied to expansions is gigantic, you should buy them :)
---
No, that's wrong, I meant Kunnavang. Glint only had 2 scions and they are both dead now, Vlast and Aurene.
---
For trophies or items, you are unsure about, you can use /wiki [link item or name of item] and it often tells you if you have to keep it or can sell safely.
---
When it comes to most items other than greys and some trophy items, never sell them to a vendor but salvage them instead (you can buy kits at every merchant)
---
When it comes to gear you usually want to salvage everything you don't need anymore under level 80, once you reach 80 you wanna salvage everything but rares with basic salvage kit or copper-fed if you have it.  rares you wanna look if they are higher than the ectoplasm price or just salvage with something like the mystic salvage kit or silver fed. [here is a site that can look at your inventory via API key and tell you what to sell or salvage if you care about it.](http://gw.zweistein.cz/gw2ecto/)
---
You can salvage all items of a specific rarity if you right-click a salvage kit and choose the option in the drop-down menu.
---
Also with the new changes to gear you get unidentified gear now, I suggest putting those in an invisible bag so you don't salvage them all on accident since they are worth more if you identify them first and salvage the gear coming out since you can also get higher rarity gear from them.
---
If you have any more questions you can ask them here or write me ingame mail or a whisper in-game: Schikatu.3071  That goes for any new player here btw, even if you need actual help in-game.
---
Hope that was understandable enough and helps you on your journey without wasting too much time inventory managing if you have your bank full though you can also create an additional character, buy some cheap bags and use it as a bank alt.
---
If I missed something please let me know.
---
Also, anything happened on April 29? I lost 2k, yet I barely play anything besides daily pvp.
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/3L3d52Y.png](https://i.imgur.com/3L3d52Y.png)
---
Mmmm... makes me wonder if this trick would work in WvW too...
---
We should invade both by ~~stargate~~ asura gate, and by ~~hatak~~ mists-faring asura cube.
---
thx nici :)
---
Looks like https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Xiuquatl
---
I have a different idea. Maybe a group that dealt the killing blows. This group once challenged old Kraklatorik and very nearly killed him, but failed. Not only losing a member, they also losing Glint, and ultimately resented each other until a different Elder Dragon's threat finally bring them back together. Maybe this group finally fulfilled their Destiny...
---
I guess for the beginning Bags and salvage kits are good to have on you.
---
Jesus, cover those ears! how indecent!
---
No because we had antagonists in season 3 Primordus, Jormag, fake Lazuras/Balthazar and real Balthazar if anything the magic unbalance was front and center in episode 1 of season 3 and in the background the rest of the season. For season 5 I want the opposite with the magic unbalance to be the season story and the enemy in the background.
---
 No I think these lines are in the episode but really early on.
---
None. It’s down to shield generators to block the attacks.
---
Yes. Both loot and lag are bad and world bosses haven't been engaging content anyway.
---
Now I'm going to log on and send Chordall a hold. Thanks for making this community so amazing.
---
&gt; nearly a quarter dozen NPCs
---
That's just a way to make *"two"* sound like *"many"*.
---
eu or na?
---
Kralkatorrik is a disappointing grandpa?
---
Don't worry, Zhaitan is here for you.
---
Absolutely, I’ve been doing WBs on the regular before this event so why would I stop now? I’ve always made a point to hit up Teq and Karka as often as I can. I honestly find a lot of the WBs fun, especially teq
---
ritualist's staff skin, from the gem store.
---
Not sure about the gloves/chromatic aberration.
---
Lol as if
---
Lol. Oh I’m a hoarder too. I’ve got max bag space on a few toons (32 slot bags), all the storage panes, a few toons for just storage (one is just ascended rings), 2 maxed out storage guilds(should have made more when it was easy), and 3 alt accounts mostly for storage and daily long in rewards!( laurels for the t6 mats). I will not seek help. ;P
---
Yeah, you're not the only one who wants a mini of this :I.
---
And that's why her possible appearance in killing Krakaltorik would be more epic. Maybe in a super golem, doing a superhero landing right on the Dragon's head?
---
Fanks ❤️
---
Skyscale is a red herring. The actual flying mount of episode 6 is a Tengu.
---
Zafirah hasn't "earned" such a moment in my view. Still too new.
---
Since it's on the coast, we can get a Bubbles teaser for next season, too!
---
question..any idea on when this deal is going to end?
---
now THIS is plot racing
---
 Aurene having a puppy bath is a curious idea
---
same happened to me in WvW.
---
i just got in there, walking around, getting my ass slapped by roamers.
---
so i asked in map chat what to do etc., and some total stranger just sent me 25g along with some info about the gamemode, builds, my servers ts.
---
DH's are able to pull off more dps than Rens, dps ren rotation is pretty hard to do in Pugs while managing 100% alac uptime. Dps dropps quick after opener. In the end its usually better to run a dps/alac chrono actually instead of the ren. While Chrono also brings allot of utility like blinks and most importantly Portals (double portals with white mantle usefull for Cliffside f. E.)
---
I think he meant the Michael Jackson tattoo the guy posted a link to? I'm curious too... that's a really shitty tattoo.
---
EU server by any chance?
---
The lily is cool, it's like my lil instant teleport to the auction house,bank,npc to sell junk in which the area is pretty with flowers and a fountain in the middle that you can dive into and swim deep down.  Totally worth the buy :)
---
I really dont understand why they've done it though, Yeah they want Felicia Day and can't get her when they want to. But they replaced several voice actors before, just look at Rox for example.
---
It is one of the big things that I just dont understand with Anet.
---
He is the voice of WoW , so he have zero interest in other games
---
Maybe less wholesome; but I always feel that taking that little bit of economy in having to make choices based on what little money you have, or just outright buying full sets of armor every 5 levels, takes a bit of the value of rewards away. It takes away the incentive of going the extra mile before the content goes stale.
---
This is actually an excellent idea!
---
Got it, that mate!!
---
So your saying it still made no sense when the rest of destiny’s edge was fighting they’re old enemy AND snaff appeared? They’ve had amazing opportunities to bring her back to the story, episodes 4 and 5 both, but they haven’t.
---
Would also be very cliche if she just appeared out of nowhere and was like the saving hero of the day...
---
Three. Twelve divided by 4 is 3. But it's probably more tbh. And even if not it's still 300% times more references added after Rytlock: Requiem, which is only 2 months, than before, which is 6.5 years.
---
So though the number is small its still huge.
---
Thanks
---
Kinda sad that nobody does the Evolved Jungle Worm anymore. But maybe it's just too difficult with pugs
---
My ranger hit level 80 by talking to some weird bear people about balance. What now? I'd go for map completion but I want to save the western part of the map for leveling my sylvari guardian and crafting is hard to get started on because as a f2p I don't have proper access to a trading post.
---
thief
---
I use 2 screens so I love to use borderless window. But it makes no difference for me if windowed or fullscreen. I just switch to fullscreen and back to borderless and that improves my fps.
---
Better to go for Harrier's on Renegade since you really want a healer for pugs and it heals for a TON.
---
It's magic.
---
Not dragon corruption, just death magic (which Zhaitan liked to eat)
---
&gt; the Bone Dragons, which, with one exception, appeared to be part of the Orrian undead host. (Rotscale was a weird anomaly, specifically guarding the entrance to the Krytan Mausoleum. )
---
He's even more special. Rotscale's corpse was in the Shiverpeaks and was raised by Stone Summit. It then trekked across Kryta to the mausoleum to guard it for unknown reasons, either gathering or creating undead along the way.
---
&gt; I guess my instinct before was to say that these were just half-formed Risen Champions, made in the image of Zhaitan
---
They weren't made in Zhaitan's image. The lack of a lower half was pure coincidence more or less. The lore for the bone dragons is that their physical might was so powerful that as they raised themselves from the grave, their body tore apart. The forearms too strong and the back spine too weak.
---
Whereas Zhaitan is made of multiple dragons and not enough to form hind legs.
---
&gt; Zhaitan (who was, presumably, the magical source of the Cataclysm and Vizier Khilbron's necromancy).
---
Nope. The Lost Scroll was the magical source of the Cataclysm. And Khilbron's necromancy is ultimately not all that unique, his lichdom presumably coming before the Cataclysm as he made Fendi Nin who is similarly a lich, and also helped in creating The Hunter a Shiro'ken with a lich's "immortality".
---
Keep in mind that Zhaitan was non-existent in the developers' minds when Prophecies was made. Though they may one day retcon Khilbron's draconian appearance to be due to Zhaitan, they haven't yet, and it's unlikely they will.
---
&gt; There was more secondary evidence that Dragons existed in Tyria during human times -- there are distinctly draconic murals (but distinctly un-Glintlike) in the Ascalonian Catacombs, there's Dragon's Gullet...That's all that comes to mind right now.
---
That's technically concept art of the Forgotten. Not a dragon.
---
&gt; The Guild Chat mentioned that the early designs of the Skyscale were more 'serpentine',
---
You misheard them. They said crystalline, not serpentine. They changed this because "spoiler lore reasons" and to prevent them from looking like branded dragons or seeming to be the same as Aurene.
---
Everything honestly. All the armor seems to be catered towards guardians being as there’s so much blue things.
---
In fact this is a collective dream and we are all dead
---
I have Fractal God, Envoys Herald, CoZ, etc with 7k AP but please keep pretending AP means shit. Having 4 stacks of essences sitting in my bank makes me a leech, sigh.
---
One thing to note: Map completion is per character, not per account. It's one thing if you just want to experience it first on your Sylvari, but you'll need to eventually do everything on one character for the title, Gift of Exploration, etc. not to mention waypoints.
---
That said... you ought to be able to manage crafting as f2p, since you can at least buy the base components, and there are other ways of obtaining max-level gear (more than it's practical to go into detail about here) if you'd still rather not craft.
---
As for content... your choices are somewhat limited without expansions. You can try to work your way through Fractals of the Mists, hop into PvP or WvW, or just go achievement hunting. There's not a lot of structure for you to work towards, though, so largely you'll have to find what you enjoy.
---
getting code 7 too by login to certain character too for almost a week now too , can't access it too
---
Just another reason why we need a Story mode for raids.
---
That actually makes a lot of sense. Kralk'd prophecy of a world without him fulfilled. Glint's prophecy of her legacy killing Kralkatortik also fulfilled.
---
Caithe is now this unique Mordy/Kralk magic hybrid creature, which could allow her to act as a conduit to transfer Kralk's magic to the Pale Tree?
---
I mean she birthed Grenth and now we have all of this 'people don't have to stay dead' nonsense so she's not completely innocent.
---
Things would be so much simpler if Dhuum was still doing his job.
---
Game is dead. Nothing to see here. Please move along.
---
Hey, I'm the artist behind this. I do not appreciate my art being reposted without my consent. Please remove it, and ask for permission next time you consider posting someone else's creations. Thank you.
---
How is it shifting focus? I said in my case I actually talked with the guy and he didn't have KP to link. I also said your case is rather unusual and I would rather guess wrong on cases such as yours and save time in the majority of other cases. So that is addressing your comment directly.
---
Do you need me to repeat my comment again?
---
Also the image doesn't show your AP.
---
When I used to dungeon ascalon as a budding f2p level 30 player, I had this one veteran player tag along with every path I tried and failed. He gave 3-4 mithril boxes and told me I'd find it handy and just vanished after that.
---
I wish I could've mailed him and gifted him something back. I lost his contact and he only exists in my memory. 
---
So nowadays when I find a new player, I give them advice, some gold, and 4 mithril boxes all the time. This community deserve that kind of support and love.
---
Just one specific comment. When you dodge, you don't need to avoid a circle or damage. If you time your dodge, you're invulnerable for the time of that dodge. Even if you remain in a circle, if you're dodging at the right time, you're not going to take damage, or you'll take considerably less damage, depending on the situation.
---
There are situations all over this game where there are circles everywhere, and you can just dodge into the wall next to you, remain in the circle and take no damage. It's just a matter of learning the timing.
---
Ghosts of Ascalon is a brilliant read and got me so excited to see Divinity's Reach, Ebonhawke and the ruins of Ascalon City. 
---
I wish we got the book version of those things but oh well.
---
Touche
---
DH dps. Firebrand zerk or heal both with pack runes
---
We still run it 2/3 times a day with TTT. Gathering is half an hour before the spawn and about then the LFG is up as well.
---
For more info the Discord discord.gg/KAav7ka and our TS ts3.gw2ttt.com
---
Support Scourge is ok for T4 groups, if you can provide 25 stacks of might to the group. It has no business being listed as "great" though. Quite a lot of T4 groups won't take you. I'd be surprised, if you can find a single CM group with that build.
---
Heal firebrand is fine, but as has already been said, it's rather specialized. It only fits into groups that want a healer together with a DPS Alacgade. If you go for firebrand, you should also make sure to be able to switch to DPS Quickbrand so that you fit into all variants of the meta Firebrigade comp.
---
Banner Warrior is definitely the most universally accepted support class in fractals. Just make sure to get a dagger so you can switch to Spellbreaker when "No pain no gain" is active.
---
Heal or zerk firebrand with pack runes. DH as dps
---
There should be an achievement for having, say, eighty items (or stacks) in your inventory.
---
It's just me and 205k bots on this subreddit. Sorry, dude. (If you're wondering why you're getting snarky answers, it's because this question is asked almost daily.)
---
33 times I did that quiz. I only had to repeat it once. The first time.
---
I wish I had that success rate in my actual exams.
---
If you want to unlock a mount without doing future story content, you could do the WvW collection to unlock the warbeast. It is slower than some other mounts and doesn't have a cool movement ability, but it is still faster than walking and immune to CC.
---
Commanders can actually get covered in branded shards until they get encased in a branded crystal, and just shake it off. 
---
Looks like some people are more resistant to corruption than others, even if they are not sylvari.
---
We're all playing Guild Wars 3 now.
---
HAHAHA! Holy! I completely forgot! Thanks friend!
---
Red Racer and Menace.
---
Her NPC rank is Legendary.
---
Comes Tuesday and gw2 doesn’t work like that. Gear won’t be changing. If you have rares and or exotics you’ll be fine
---
Even though that OP likes to stir shit, it did happen. The times I saw it, it was a [Side]-tagged be low level thief, usually capping stuff after 9AM . Pretty much every morning, same as the week before. Not blaming the guy, the scaling issues have been known for a while and haven't been fixed so why not use it.                    
---
It's easily countered by just keeping camps flipped every 12 minutes, it's just laziness if your enemy actually gets one. We've also used one to cap all the desert keeps with one duneroller (20min) before. Doesn't seem to be a "working as intended"-thing though and hopefully gets fixed sooner rather than later.
---
yeah and that whats good bot would wrote
---
You’re likely fighting against very experienced players with fully infused gear, you’re going to suck. Just keep playing it (if you enjoy it) and eventually you will get better. Thief/daredevil/deadeye are notoriously hard to play well when solo; if you don’t do serious damage with your immediate attack, you’re likely gonna get stomped unless you know how to sustain yourself. 
---
Use your deaths as learning material, you will improve over time.
---
what ive been doing just hard to keep up with mounts XD
---
If you're talking about the wiki I'd rather not sort through dozens of pages to still not know the best places to farm.
---
If you're talking about dulfy the guides are fantastic but completely eat the resources of a lot of computers (including mine).
---
If you're talking about gw2efficiency it only lists the materials.
---
There another site I don't know about?
---
cool cheers
---
That would be a bad idea for two reasons:
---
* That magic is needed in Tyria to keep the 'eternal alchemy' system working smoothly. In Taimi's simulation, when Jormag and Primordus cancelled each other's magic, the loss of that magic make the system crumble.
---
* Kralkatorrik has poked so many holes in reality that it would likely just pour back into the world and go wild.
---
We need a solution that will remove Kralkatorrik as a threat, keep the magic form going wild and restore the normal flow of magic. That means either replacing Kralkatorrik, or changing Krakatorrik into something else, like when the forgotten tried to cleanse him like they cleansed Glaust into Glint.
---
k
---
I don't like that more than dungeons. :D
---
But other people do, so that's a fantastic addition. The next bifrost I make I may do that. Arah is cancer.
---
You got it wrong dude. Tyria blows up cause the magic is just too much to handle. 
---
Like boiling water inside a pan. If you heat it up too much, the steam will burst out. Dragons or not, doesn't matter, we just need something to contain the energy, or regulate it, and by regulating, it means, keeping the balance of the energy level. A decent level to allow the races to live as they live now but to prevent the world from becoming too unstable.
---
you want to roam as a deadeye since yourclass have very little to offer in large scale fights. If you like zerging I'd recommend of gearing different class - you can look up this [site](http://builds.vabbi.org/) for more info.
---
Regarding crystalline/serpentine -- they said both. When talking about the detailing of the scales, they mentioned that they took a fair bit of inspiration from the cobra, but decided to go with a more lizard-y scale pattern rather than the banded formation of snakes. I believe the word 'catsnake' was used.
---
On the murals -- yeah, I have heard that that particular image was a very early take on the Forgotten, but it isn't the only [dragon-esque mural](https://imgur.com/a/Lo9tgX8) there, either. Once is a coincidence, but twice is a trend.
---
Yeah, I know Zhaitan wasn't a glimmer in their eye back in the day and they were probably just going with a well-trod fantasy trope with the Bone Dragons. However, on Khilbron specifically, it was mentioned that he found dark magic deep beneath Orr which granted him great power -- the scroll, sealed away in the catacombs by the Five Gods. This isn't so much a rebuttal as a discussion point: if the Five Gods were the ones who sealed it in Arah, then presumably the Lost Scrolls were pre-Exodus, and quite possibly from before Abaddon's assault on the Gates of Heaven. I don't think it has been explicitly confirmed that Abaddon was the 'source' of the Cataclysm, but rather, that he convinced Khilbron to do it and knew where the incantation was. This point won't be possible to call one way or another unless it gets picked up in GW2 somehow, but it makes a certain amount of logical sense that the doomsday spell which sunk the nation of Orr and reanimated its population as undead thralls, could have been drawing on the leaking energy from the dragon who un-sunk the nation of Orr and reanimated its population as undead thralls. I'm not arguing it was necessarily Zhaitan's INTENT caused the cataclysm, he simply powered it? Abaddon's major mode of operation throughout GW1 before the Nightfall event began wasn't using his own magic -- he used the magic already in the world, and corrupted it to his purposes. The Searing was accomplished through pre-existing Searing Cauldrons (found as far south as [the Desolation](https://imgur.com/a/1D1xKCB), the Jade Wind was a corruption of Dwayna's air magic in the Harvest Temple, the Chaos Rifts were a repurposing of the Five's technology in the Shadow Nexus, and the barriers between Tyria and the Mists were weakened by corrupting Lyssa's magic in the Sebelkeh Basilica. Fun to think about; it's kind of out of the scope of dragons though, so I'll pull back for now. XD
---
On Rotscale, I wasn't sure if his appearance in the North Shiverpeaks was considered canonical, or just an early beta convenience. That's really interesting, and I'd love to see them follow up on it -- even if Rotscale isn't a minion of Zhaitan, he makes a particularly convenient Ascension candidate to hold the death magic sphere, should your working theory end up panning out.
---
lol - why the downvotes?  The name is in the top left of his screenshot...
---
They probably have fully ascended gear with infusions on each piece. The likely have a bunch of offensive boons too. 
---
It’s really just a case of playing the game mode, you will improve as time goes on and you upgrade your gear.
---
Im intrigued.
---
Then get the mount. It's easy.
---
Damnit, Word of God always ruins my fun. XD Fair enough. I will note that, post-release, mounts were also explicitly ruled out in GW2, so dev answers aren't necessarily immutable. But, I've never heard that acknowledgement from Grubb so I guess I won't hold my breath.
---
Your point on The Dream is pretty curious, actually -- it's been a while since I've played HoT so that detail must have slipped my mind. I was assuming that "The Dream" was essentially a hive-mind infrastructure for Mordrem to have orders communicated to them, 'walled off' by the Pale Mother and used as a tool to prepare Sylvari for the world. I figured this was a product of Mordremoth, as Kralkatorrik has (According to the Inquest in Sandswept Isles) inherited this hive mind capability for his own minions. 
---
I figured the reason that the Nightmare Court fought against Mordremoth wasn't necessarily because Dream and Nightmare are independent of Mordremoth, but rather due to the fact that the Court's major drive is essentially freedom -- they see the Pale Tree and Ventari's Tablets as chains which force Sylvari to act in a certain way, follow their Wyld Hunts, and separates them from their true nature. I'd think that when the Court found out that their true nature was actually unquestioning obedience to an Elder Dragon, they just chose the least offensive side. 
---
Is there any available lore on what the Dream...actually is? It does have similar features to areas of The Mists -- it's an echo of Tyria, populated for the most part by souls who haven't been born yet. If the Realm of Torment is an afterlife, the Dream acts more like a prelife. It's also accessible while born, but generally only through communion with the Pale Tree, or apparently a Vision Crystal.
---
you play deadeye, so you own PoF, which means you can get the warclaw yourself. all it takes is a single wvw point in the appropriate mastery to begin your acquisition.
---
Even if the next episode doesn't show up there, I think that spot would be a good place to start a season/expansion around Bubbles!
---
You can find them in the final mission of episode 5.
---
 [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Awakened\_Sylvari](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Awakened_Sylvari)
---
The cinematic at the end of "The way forward" in PoF says you are wrong. Tyria is being destroyed because the cycle of magic is collapsing, due to the void created by two elder dragons being gone.
---
This is direct from the in-game lore, we're told by the forgotten who raised vlast.
---
I kindof hope this doesn't happen, but at the same time I want my favorite character back...
---
It's worth mentioning you can get mystic clovers from PvP and WvW  reward tracks. Some of them drop 7 at a time the first time you complete them, then 2 thereafter. As G1 legendaries have a lot of time-gated materials, making "play a round in PvP" part of your daily routine will help significantly.
---
We know a dragon champion can usurp an ED, Aurene is the perfect example? She's a dragon minion free from her master's influence, just like the Pale Tree, and the story officially stated she would replace Kralk... 
---
So if Aurene officially can usurp him, then the Pale tree can too.
---
The others are mostly correct but I believe the helmet is the Mistforged Glorious Hero's Plate Helm instead. The Ardent version only has purple crystals, but the Mistforged version makes them dyeable, and this one looks like it was dyed Permafrost.
---
Forgive me if I’m just stupid, but is there any way to level up armor? For example if I like the cultural armor that’s level 60, is it possible to level it up to 80? Thanks

Jacaranda has the highest damage. 
---
Rock Gazelle has the highest breakbar damage / CC
---
Soulbeasts just merge with a Ferocious pet, normally the Rock Gazelle for CC or the Smokescale for invulnerability frames
---
&gt; Regarding crystalline/serpentine -- they said both. When talking about the detailing of the scales, they mentioned that they took a fair bit of inspiration from the cobra, but decided to go with a more lizard-y scale pattern rather than the banded formation of snakes. I believe the word 'catsnake' was used.
---
Scale patterns is a bit different than serpentine appearance like Forgotten though. You made it sound as if the shape of the Skyscale was intended to be more snake-like (like comparing gw2 wyverns to gw1 saltspray dragons).
---
&gt; On the murals -- yeah, I have heard that that particular image was a very early take on the Forgotten, but it isn't the only dragon-esque mural there, either. Once is a coincidence, but twice is a trend.
---
Eh, twice isn't quite a trend when one isn't related, since it'd just end up being one. But it's fantasy, and they had quite a few draconian art pieces which is standard practice for high fantasy settings. I wouldn't put too much stock into it in all honesty, since we're talking about early, easily overlooked, designs of Prophecies when the lore was being built.
---
It's not like we're talking about the Talmark Wilderness pillars or the Wizard's Folly tower, both of which are iconic in their own rights.
---
&gt; However, on Khilbron specifically, it was mentioned that he found dark magic deep beneath Orr which granted him great power -- the scroll, sealed away in the catacombs by the Five Gods. This isn't so much a rebuttal as a discussion point: if the Five Gods were the ones who sealed it in Arah, then presumably the Lost Scrolls were pre-Exodus, and quite possibly from before Abaddon's assault on the Gates of Heaven. I don't think it has been explicitly confirmed that Abaddon was the 'source' of the Cataclysm, but rather, that he convinced Khilbron to do it and knew where the incantation was.
---
Accurately, the wording was that Khilbron turned to dark magic, not that he found it and it granted him power. He went straight for the Lost Scrolls, which were (originally) pre-Bloodstone but post-Gift of Magic empowered scrolls of magic. The gods had sealed a lot of powerful artifacts in Arah's vaults.
---
Abaddon wasn't the source of the Cataclysm, but the Lost Scrolls are suggested very heavily to be far more recent than Zhaitan, and they did not draw from Zhaitan. Not to mention that the GW2 cinematic showcasing the Cataclysm colors it to be light blue light splitting the land, which actually implies that what the scrolls did was tamper with the ley lines (also depicted as that light blue light). The animation of undead could have been Khilbron's personal actions over the course of the year or two that passed between the Cataclysm and the undead's invasion of Kryta.
---
&gt; The Searing was accomplished through pre-existing Searing Cauldrons (found as far south as the Desolation,) the Jade Wind was a corruption of Dwayna's air magic in the Harvest Temple, the Chaos Rifts were a repurposing of the Five's technology in the Shadow Nexus, and the barriers between Tyria and the Mists were weakened by corrupting Lyssa's magic in the Sebelkeh Basilica.
---
Not entirely correct here.
---
* The Searing Cauldrons were created by the charr at the titan's instructions. Abaddon, through the titans, merely provided the original one - the Cauldron of Cataclysm. The implication is that the Flame Shamans pulled magic from Kralkatorrik to enchant the cauldrons (either directly or indirectly through the Cauldron of Cataclysm). We also don't know if that one in the Desolation is at all related to the charr, or just a reuse of models for a generic cauldron appearance.
---
* The Jade Wind was indeed twisting Dwayna's gifted magic, but not necessarily air magic. Rather, the magic gifted was meant to be used for bountiful harvests which would imply *life* magic, or even just preservation (extreme preservation would be akin to petrification after all).
---
* The Shadow Nexus would have been Abaddon's from the get go, and his own ability and the Mists' to open rifts (just as any avatar of the gods can).
---
* And the barriers were weakened by rituals cast by Varesh. These rituals were contained within a scroll held by the Apocrypha, which was Abaddon's from the get go. She may have used Lyssan priests as sacrifices for one of the rituals, but the rituals themselves were Abaddon's own like the Shadow Nexus.
---
&gt; On Rotscale, I wasn't sure if his appearance in the North Shiverpeaks was considered canonical, or just an early beta convenience. That's really interesting, and I'd love to see them follow up on it -- even if Rotscale isn't a minion of Zhaitan, he makes a particularly convenient Ascension candidate to hold the death magic sphere, should your working theory end up panning out.
---
[Tis canon](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The_Scribe/20060713), Rotscale came from the Shiverpeaks. Though the Stone Summit's involvement is never mentioned, it can be inferred given the rest is confirmed, and it is never countered.
---
But Rotscale is also most likely canonically dead, as Keiran [got its bow](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Keiran%27s_Bow_%28Rotwing%29).
---
Yeah, the the problem isn't really how to kill Kralk at this point, but how to kill him without destroying Tyria...
---
They already have [Dragon's blood](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dragonsblood_weapons) weapons lol
---
Well, the voice actress pretty much confirmed we were going for a new dragonblood spear, so you're probably right
---
Love it
---
Tequatl is heavily suggested to have been steadily replacing Zhaitan. Aurene, Vlast, and Glint could replace Kralkatorrik.
---
But the thing is, they're not just dragon champions freed from an Elder Dragon's control. They're actually dragons connected to a sphere of The All.
---
The Pale Tree may be a dragon champion, but she's not a dragon. That's the key difference.
---
No, but you can change the appearance of level 80 armour to look like the cultural armour in the [Wardrobe tab of your hero menu](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Wardrobe) using transmutation charges (which you get for free by doing things like completing maps or playing PvP).
---
Which fractal CMs are people doing daily and what are the rewards?  
---
thanks!
---
Glint made the original spear from Kralk's blood probably because it would've been the most effective. She didn't get to try making another since, as we know, she was killed during the first fight alongside Snaff. Glint herself is a direct offspring of Kralk, like the Shatterer, and Aurene is an offspring of Glint. They are true dragons, which I imagine makes their blood stronger in some way than just some plain-old Branded minotaur.
---
All the analysis aside, I just found Aurene's corpse in a blender to be funny.
---
As the other commenter said, it does get better in the expansions and living world. Path of Fire and season 4 so far have exceeded my expectations.
---
Just get him to the mists and pull a Dr. Strange on him.
---
Yeah! The bone mission I never did. I did barrage clears so often
---
99 and 100 are the two standard CMs
---
It's probably just easier for you to read the wiki on those two since there's a list
---
Wow thanks for the replies. I just tested it out. Got a crazy motion sickness because of the tiny small paths. It's just like Halloween labyrinth.
---
Most of the stuff can be done in EOTM where no one can use the warclaw. Took me perhaps 10-12 hours to get the mount with zero prior WvW experience.
---
&gt; My way of playing is mashing the buttons, it's the way I play since my first MMO
---
how do you choose your build?
---
Hello, I plan on getting the Path of Fire Deluxe today as a new player but played GW long time ago. As a new player what can I focus on to do duegeons and start getting into PvE quickly? I hope to start heavy tonight and then light up as the work week starts but I want to really get into for at least 12hrs to get started. I will definitely use the max boost as I like healing/tanking.
---
well that's great... cause tbh the base game play is getting kind of stale. was hoping the story would be something to look forward to as i lvl.
---
&gt;fancy dildo
---
Bad Dragon?
---
This is damn legit, I love it
---
I thought it was gonna be the Persona one :(
---
^ This. You can't even place it on the guild bank.
---
Thanks. I'll check it out
---
The only Jack Frost that matters. You could maybe make an Asura cosplay for him.
---
Your role is to dps and help people CC bosses generally. In dungeons you should also provide stealth so your group can move between bosses quickly. You can do this by placing a smoke field (Pistol 5, Smoke Screen etc.) and blasting it with your Shortbow 2 as many times as possible (don't use the chain skill that fractures the bomb).
---
Thieves have it good in organized PvE in that bulk of their CC comes from Basilisk Venom that costs the thief no dps in slotting and using (if you don't count the casting time of course). If you are next to your party members that is up to 750 breakbar damage right there, which is all you need to use IMO. Your rotation will also be easy, so you can focus more on surviving and learning mechanics.
---
Which quiz is this? I've done map comp twice and don't actually remember doing it.
---
So I first just want to say thanks to this community for always responding to my newbie questions! I've asked at least 3 and received a response within 1 hour for all of them with detailed information, you guys rock!
---
My most recent questions is regarding using my level boost. I have both expansions but only 1 character; a Guardian at level 30. I've been considering boosting my Guardian to 80 because I would be able to get the mounts as well as having nicer gear.
---
My main "goal" is to 100% the map at the moment, and I considered that having Gold gear and a mount would speed this up. I've started to burn a little bit out of leveling but so far I think GW2 has the best leveling experience of any MMO I've played.
---
Would boosting my Guardian suck a lot of the fun out of playing? I've played the profession enough that I think I would know how to use it at level 80, but I'm concerned that I might be missing out on something if I boost.
---
Thanks so much guys!
---
Hey! I'm a veteran in GW2 and I recently picked up FFXIV so I'd like to give a bit of insight on Tyria as compared to Eorzea.
---
Whereas you get ALL The story in FFXIV through quests (MSQ, mostly), getting to know and understand the world takes either research or plowing through quest upon quest, reading walls of text at a time, and as a spoiled GW2 player, I can't stand reading quests for long before I start just skipping cutscenes. 
---
In GW2, the game's story picks up JUST AFTER the core game story ends, but you'll feel EXACTLY how I feel dropping into ARR without any knowledge of 1.0; I had no idea who anyone is, they keep mentioning people and events but I didn't see any of that... what meteor? Bahawho? Garleans? Ascians? Same as with 2.0, don't worry, keep playing and you'll get to know them and understand them, specially your main crew.  If you ever feel like, "Hey, this Faren guy is kinda interesting, who is he?" A quick /wiki will get you everything you need to know about them; even minor npcs get their wiki pages.
---
As for world-building, GW2 has a nice, simple way to deliver this to you, instead of picking up every sidequest, just turn up the volume and walk around. You'll naturally eavesdrop on NPCs having conversations, they'll talk about politics, gods, events, everything you need to know about the world is out there, playing as random voice clips that some players never really get to listen to. Every race feels different, tired of human-talk? Hang out in the charr-related areas, visit the Asuran zones, this game will allow you to level up and get level-appropiate gear in any map at any time, so you're not losing on anything by not going to higher level areas.
---
And as a short-term thing: The Main story is divided in 3 parts. Racial story (Which is the first 30 levels), Your Order stories (40-60?) and the dragon menace (This technically also starts at 30), so you'll feel more of the game's actual story on your next story mission. It's like... hitting Lv 15, when the story starts to merge.

Ppl already answered your question, but let me add something more
---
On above image you can see 3 items. The last part of their description states what bounding do they have:
---
First is Account bound. That means you can use it on any character on your account. You cant transfer it to another account.
---
Second is Soulbound. That means only the character to which it is bound can use it.
---
Last image shows what a character that is not bound to given item sees. It tells you to what character given item is bound.
---
Before using (equiping,selecting stats) of item that is "Soulbound on use" you will receive a warning with confirmation.
---
You can read more on binding on following links:

---
Oh no...
---
Main story isnt that good but the story and lore of the world is one of the best in its genre
---
Actually deep and good are very different questions. The personal story, on one single character isn't really very deep. It's not until you play it on multiple characters, with multiple races, with multiple choices that you really understand what Anet was going for. And what they somewhat succeeded at.
---
The personal story is more of a web than just a linear story. How you feel about certain things or characters will depend on which stories you've chosen for your character.
---
There are a lot of examples of this. The thing is, the beginning of the story is meant to give you an introduction to your species and what's going on with local problems to some degree, before you're really involved in the stuff that moves the world. The middle story gets you more involved in what comes later, but none of it is Shakespeare.
---
That said, coming from the perspective of someone who's played pretty much every personal story, it's a bit deeper than you probably currently think it is. That doesn't make it good, however.
---
I feel the personal story is quite flawed in a number of ways, but that doesn't mean there's nothing to it, or that there aren't things within it that interest.
---
In general, Charr and Sylvari stories are my favorites.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Crusader_Arevir_Soulhammer
---
Story gets pretty great! FFXIV gets off to a better start because it throws you into the "larger conflict" right off the bat (which makes sense since you are supposed to be this "chosen hero" with a direct connection to the fate of the world, etc). 
---
GW2 starts you off as some poorly dressed mook in Beatsville, MI just reacting to the immediate issues on hand (Farmer Johnson has spiders in his field, bandits harassing some cows, and the queen has no better soldiers to send on errands than some guy that got a lucky kill on whatever the human intro boss was). Eventually you'll evolve, *in both fashion and status*, from mook to racially focused goon to faction thumping grunt until you finally hit the **larger story** that everyone hits, causing you to become the "seasoned hero" you were always destined to be.   
---
On the way, you'll watch your fellow cool and kinda basic friends start to grow up alongside you and take on new positions/personalities too and run into many of them over and over again throughout the expanding story.   
---
To repeat what others have said, the stories in the expansions and definitely the Living World Seasons (which is free if you log in during them but worth checking out when on sale) are definitely better than the core story but I think they feel better not just because of the better writing but also because the identity of the main hero is fully developed by that point. 1-80, in both story and gameplay, feels like just one big introduction before you get to "Real Guild Wars".   
---
*Race arc, Faction arc, Trinity arc, Prologue finale and then finally, Book 1: Thorns, Book 2: Fire* (Will Book 3 be "Water" and "S.....?" !?!)   
---
Either way, hope it sparks for you soon!
---
The story is as deep as a river, it flows, but there is not much to it other then a main "act of events". Doesn't even come close to games like Bioshock which have an ocean of Story and bits n' pieces you can dive for.
---
Great video! I saw it in the MMORPG subreddit.
---
Wanted to let you know, for some reason THIS post is NOT showing up in the GW2 subreddit.  I only found it by going to your profile to see if you had posted it to this sub.  I don't know if mods need to approve it or something?  You could try posting the link in a text post to see if that works?
---
Good luck, I think this sub will like it.  Nice work on the editing and cinematography!
---
Ah I understand your confusion. The link you have provided is actually for the first Guild Wars, and the game I'm talking about is for Guild Wars 2. You'd be right to say that the GvG in both games is extremely different, and basically not the same thing at all, and I would 100% agree with you, however they're both still GvG, and they're both still awesome and fun!
---
Thanks, and I hope you have a great day :)

Open world: Reaper #1

It's impressive how people just downvoted and didn't answer my simple question. Why's that?
---
Look on snowcrows/discretize for raids/fractals. They break down each meta build, and discuss how much output they can get and how to do so
---
32 slot bags need to be crafted, using Superior Runes of Holding generated from Ecto gambling in Amnoon and other crafting materials/recipes found in the dwarven vaults in Desert Highlands.  You can obtain all the needed materials, including the recipes, from the Trading Post.  It's an expensive undertaking to craft, though.
---
You can also earn a single 32 slot Olmakhan bag from LS4 Episode 2, a series of collection achievements that will send you around the map doing various things.  In the process of those achievements, you'll earn the recipes to craft further 32 slot Olmakhan bags, which will still require the Superior Runes of Holding from Ecto gambling but uses different materials from Episode 2 instead of the dwarven vault items.
---
maybe because there is a sticky on the front page for simple questions
---
A lot of posts on this sub tend to get downvoted to 0, it's pretty par for the course.
---
I don't know if people are actively going out of their way to do so, but if you scroll by new, you'll see a bunch of 0s

You'd be surprised at how meticulous sampling has gotten these days. I know for my own audio production the only time I break out my recording equipment for piano is when I specifically want my piano's character and tone for the piece instead of the character and tone of one of my many sampled pianos.
---
Additional details like the sound of pedals releasing, hammers striking or releasing, or creaks of the wood are often included in modern sample libraries as well, so the presence of these sounds doesn't mean you're hearing a live recording of the piece - at least, not in the sense you're referring to. It's still very likely the piece was played on a MIDI keyboard to trigger the samples.
---
Graven, Thank you so so much! I'll try it just like you said. &lt;3
---
The game is alive but we’re all dead
---
&gt;  I will definitely use the max boost as I like healing/tanking
---
Be careful not to equate healing and tanking in GW2 with how it works with other games. GW2 does not have typical MMO roles of Heal/Tank/DPS and when the community uses these terms they mean very specific things for very specific fights. Every class can be built and specced for many different roles and fighting styles and you will be expected to manage your own healing, evades, and DPS with your build for the most part.
---
There are two types of things you could consider tanks:
---
Raid tanks ("Tanks"), which lead aggro on a handful of raid bosses. This role almost always falls to Chronomancer (Mesmer) due to how gear stats work. These specific fights are high-difficulty content and are the only bosses in the game that have reliable aggro mechanics and 'tanking' does not work in any other content.
---
"Tanky" builds, i.e. high health and sustain. Not actually called tanks by the community. The best classes that can be built passively tanky are Necromancer, Ranger, and Warrior. Guardian looks tanky as it has a very Paladin aesthetic; it has many active skills that can be used to help defend and buff allies but its actual health is the lowest of the heavy armor classes and it requires careful management.
---
Healing: Healing roles are not required in this game as every class has access to some healing and evades and you are expected to bring your own sustains. Therefore our healing roles are more like support with healing as a secondary thought. Druid (ranger) is the most common heal/support in PvE, Firebrand (Guardian) is popular in WvW. A few other builds can be used as secondary healers in certain content, like Elementalist and Revenant, but they are very much at the mercy of meta. Healing is almost never used in PvE open world, dungeons, or low level fractals as it is just not worth the DPS loss.
---
your replies land in my message box, so i dont go on your profile.
---
[My alt has neither](https://imgur.com/a/ZwpJpyz) and I still get the 15€ option IF I open it in the gemstore, and not via the GW2 store page. If you only want HoT on sale, buy it ingame.
---
Or we just turn her body into a new dragons blood spear and poke her granddaddy really hard with it.
---
&gt; what are the professions that have a slight advantage?
---
Advantage at what? PvP? WvW? Raids? Fractals? Open world leveling?
---
Also, "advantage" defined by what? Pure DPS output? That's a bullshit number unless you're excited about getting a high-score against an immobile golem that doesn't fight back. A build with a slightly lower pure-DPS result might do more damage in combat due to less time spent dodging, healing, etc. or it might synergize better with a particular party build.
---
Good luck with dagger/pistol these days. 600 range steal is really worthless.
---
I never really understood the whole combo field gameplay but I'll try it out and practice makes perfect I suppose. 
---
Again really appreciate the tips!

GW2 is one of those games that "run okay on everything, run great on nothing". It's an MMO, after all.

Are you doing all 3 as one stack, or 3 individual stacks of 1? You need the latter in the mystic forge

How much AP they have is a big giveaway, Especially if it's under 50-100. You can generally tell by how they are playing if it's a veterans new alt account.

You can always use it without Daredevil.  I mean, the guy I'm giving advice to is level 56, so Daredevil isn't even an option for him yet for WvW.
---
When using condi scourge and corruption skills, people tend to run 'master of corruption,' a trait that greatly reduces corruption skill cooldowns but also increases the amount of conditions you receive from using them. When using this trait, plaguelands applies one stack of poison in addition to its one stack of bleeding, but blood is power applies two stacks of torment in addition to its two stacks of bleeding.
---
Oh that's why, I have like 2k testimonies of heroics so I've never done the hero points.

On the note of epidemic, it's a very potent aoe clearing skill, and you're right in that it's... pretty well useless against single targets. When you're against a single target, it's popular to bring a minion, but you also have access to other useful skills depending on the boss.
---
Ah yes. We wouldn't want people posting about what they've been up to in Guild Wars 2 in a Guild Wars 2 subreddit.

The next one should be the Festival of the Four Winds in july:

HIV is hardly a death sentence in the modern day now if one has access to HIV suppressing medicines. This leaves their HIV viral load "undetectable" (so infinitismally small that our finest detection methods cannot detect the virus in their blood) and that also prevents said person from spreading HIV to an uninfected lover. The lover can also take a daily pill called Truvada that further dramatically reduces their risk of catching HIV.
---
If you want something that is still exceptionally deadly even with treatments, go with cancer. Resonance Crystal even sound radioactive.
---
Main story is its weakest, and you can tell because they tried to do so many stories at once with the race stories, orders, and introducing a certain someone right after. Once you get to Living World Season 2 you will see the storytelling improve immensely.
---
Core story came out 7 years ago and is not in any shape or form how the story is played out today. Now we have dialouge between npc's and you in real time and whilst you play the story. The story it self gets better at living worls season 2 and then it just move on and when you reach Path of Fire store your mind will start to get blown away and you can't wait for next story.
---
As for core story. Thing is you have your personal story but if you also do the story dungeons, and if you also check om maps talk to npc every were they will all bind together. Some maps are more over all story driven whilst other maps have their own thing. But you will not get it thrown at you, just read what each npc say and you will realizet there are bits and hints every were that connects with the story.
---
Either way do not judge the game on the core story, it is old, wait until you get in to season 2 and ahead. Even HoT story have it's moments.
---
To get the raptor mount, you only have to do the first mission of PoF. The visuals don't really spoil anything. I don't think that the subtitles or speech bubbles can be disabled. So you should probably change the text and audio language to a language that you don't understand. This way, you can play with sound and be able to look at the screen the entire time.

Hi, Chordall here!  I'm really glad that the two of you liked the gift!  When I started playing (about 5 years go, I think), I was gifted 50 silvers by another experienced player in The Grove.  I know it wasn't much, but as a new player, I found it really helpful to just get myself going.  I just happened to think about that when I saw your character stop to take a look at me (I was the sylvari with black wings and red and gold robes), and just decided to pass it on.  I'm not trying to impose any responsibility on you to pass it on, I just really hope you enjoy the game as much as I do!
---
i dont check the discussion thread either, just replying to messages in my inbox, which probably is also creepy to you
---
Saying it's a poor investment is dramatic. I just got a 2700x paired with my old GTX 960 and WvW is smooth as butter now.
---
Well, I still hold that it would be far worse if this declined, but this doesn't exactly spell good news either.
---
Anet isn't in a good position after all this and only time will tell if they will make it out. I can bet however, NCSoft expects more than just this.

 **Been away for 6 months.. all the meta builds are berserker now?**

---
Thank you very much! I was gonna get the deluxe but I see the boost is included in the $15 one. Is it worth to get the deluxe?
---
You need to aim inside the field. When you use a Leap or Projectile finisher they need to pass through the field but you don't need to stand in them.
---
always funny how different game subs can relate to that cat -&gt; https://old.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/bndetw/cat_rolls_in_edible_glitter_instantly_becomes_mtx/

How would she even do that though
---
My immediate thought was Dusty from Gravity Rush. :P
---
Thank you very much that was informative. I am thinking of just getting the standard for the boost but not sure if the deluxe is worth it. I will take the advice of playing around with the classes and seeing which one I enjoy.

What if she is somehow immune to the brand... Hmmmmm
---
It is usually about being aware of the fight. Knowing what the boss do and when and what you should dodge and what wont kill you if you get hit. 
---
Imo play sPvP or WvW for a while and you will have a lot of opertunites to learn that dodges and position and battle awareness is what will keep you alive. In PvP or WvW there are not scripted mobs or bosses so you really need to be aware all the time or you die. After that fractals will feel pretty easy :)
---
Honestly, from the spoilers in the new "behind the voice" episode, I have a feeling Aurene isn't coming back..
---
&gt; He's "smoking" from his wings too, which weren't touched in the battle
---
not true; we didnt see what happened outside; but we do know explosive charges were placed to drop the mountain on him and keep him inside
---
My favorite for power is smokescale personally. Lightening wyverns good to have on hand too for cc breaking.
---
Starting out, it's kinda "eh". But it gradually gets better and better and continues to do so. 
---
As someone who also played through XIV and GW2 and didn't like XIV, GW2 is pretty amazing. The main story gets decent after a while. Then it goes into season 2 where it starts to ramp up, to HoT and so on. As of where the most recent story content left off, I'd say it's pretty amazing.
---
Also, GW2 has very little of that forced solo BS that XIV puts you through and doesn't use the story as a roadblock. You can also replay missions in any order you like at anytime while bringing friends along and progressing together.
---
Wasn't Glint saying soemthing about Aurene having to accept a part of her role that would be very hard to stomach? So possibly Aurene was meant to die so we get a spear.
---
What is that graph from?
---
i guess efficiency.
---
IIRC, the voice changed post-HoT because there was a big gap between launch a HoT where they were using dialog text instead of voice narration for everything, and when they finally switched back to voice acting after several years, the original VA had forgotten how they did the original voice and couldn't quite recreate it.
---
What happened to the second SC challange?
---
Perhaps this is also why we never recovered Zhaitan's body. (Yes, I know the ground battle was planned, but scrapped due to time and tech constraints. It wasn't in the game nor told in lore and thus isn't canon.)

Put the rendering of other characters at "Lowest" and character quality at "Low". See if that helps, since it's helped me. I can even play it at much better quality settings after I did this.
---
Ok what would be the best way to go about getting better gear as an 80?
---
Reminds me of the path of exile soul rend cat mtx. Path of exile made this new skill soul rend that let out a purple ray. A streamer said it should shoot out theese cestial cat pets the game allready had. GGG shut up and took their money.
---
It's actually really morbid.
---
Original dragonblood spear was dragon blood forged with Glint's flame and wasn't strong enough to kill kralk
---
The new dragonblood weapons are brand crystals forged with Aurene's flame and were even weaker
---
So you get grandchild+crystal=weak -&gt; child+blood=stronger -&gt; kralk+flesh=strongest
---
Glint's plan was always to trick Kralk into using their own breath weapon on Aurene to make a better weapon from her corpse.  Aurene knew this and that's why they were up in Kralk's face the entire last fight trying to provoke him into breathing on her.
---
Aurene new it was a suicide mission and went along with it.  The plan was never for us to help Aurene defeat Kralk, it was for Aurene to help us defeat Kralk.

I don't Tyria lives in the "mordern day now"
---
Same issue here, I have to use windowed fullscreen, otherwise it crashes.
---
I'm sorry to break it to you but Tyria isn't as technologically advanced as modern day Earth in medical fields. Their non magical methods of healthcare involves slapping on a [poultice](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Poultice) made from someones secret cooking sauce over the afflict area.
---
&gt; So, what if we kill him in the mists and the energy blows up there and nothing bad really happens? 
---
Maybe the Mists starts bleeding through into the real world, giving us an in-game explanation why the heart vendors reset daily.
---
If it was anything like Abaddon, there needs to be someone there to take the energy.
---
But a dragon doesn't have those meds u nerd.

Unless you are buying a lot of Item Boosters or using the Candy Corn Gobbler the multi gather feature will be a negative rather than a positive since the only place that will apply is guild hall synthesizers and maybe WvW synthesizers, forgot how many hits those give.

Your throne is about to fall off this rock, just sayin

2.5k - nevermore (since you mentioned it)
---
You need to do the first story instance of PoF for the first mount. Your level doesn't matter. Just ask in mapchat of a city if someone picks you uo for it.
---
Rotscale can choke on the pointy end of a sword. I hate that dragon. It was harder to take down than Abaddon.
---
It’s worth mentioning salvaging ecto’s for Crystalline Dust (and added MF too, if you arent capped) depending on the market
---
Also, as far as the whole 10’s vs 1’s clovers, I shared a [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ANA-ZS9A2ofyx-KjbgjL8rWzLPDSG62tPLHaECoz6Fs) for that a while back that compares the two statistical costs. Might be worth adding 🤷‍♂️
---
Using Aurene's corpse to make a weapon also fits with Joko's observation that we're as much of a monster as we are a hero.
---
If your party isn't absolutely horrible you should never encounter boon problems during fights. Both have the tools to spam quickness/alac indefintely.
---
Or a fractal where you help defend LA from the attacks from Orr- Events that are already in canon from the GW2 books.
---
I wouldn't call it monstrous. Pragmatic, even honourable. Like organ donation, saving others after you're gone, and revenge for your own death. I'd want that if I were her.
---
Jack Frost was one of the character that graced Sakimichan the fame she has today…

Probably
---
Personal Story is really more of a backstory for the character/tutorial. At least that's what I consider it. It gets you to explore the main maps, gives you XP and lets you work torwards learning new mechanics over time. Plus it introduces a major threat  that continues to harass you throughout LW, HOT, and POF.
---
There's the filler episodes where the character is faced with minor challenges, but it picks up at a point where the PC aligns with one of several factions and eventually faces against the main villain of the personal story. I'm explaining it in a pretty generic way, but it does pick up plot wise once you've joined one of the several factions and develop a sort of working relationship with your faction mentor of choice in the game's story.
---
From there, you have the Living World episodes which play out a bit more like a traditional story, with some sort of lead villian and challenges the PC undertakes in order to stop them. Season 1 was implemented in a way that it can't really be repeated by new players, but Seasons 2 and up can be perchased and played by anyone. Although the post expansion pack seasons probably require their expansion packs in order to be played. Season 2's map content can be played without owning it, but there's not really any reason to do so unless you're doing leveling or you want to explore all the maps.
---
From there, you have HOT and POF, both major Expansion packs that introduce the PC to new maps, with new challenges and game mechanics, with a story that plays through those maps. There are some decisions the player can make, but for the most part the story basically ends the same way. The Living Worlds Season 3 and up also introduce new maps, but most people only play them for grinding in XP trains or for specific items and the stories themselves tend to be centered either around storylines from the expansion packs, or building up storylines for new expansions.
---
Funny how nature does that.
---
But for the specific example about using Shortbow 2 on Smoke Screen, its better that you stay inside the field. This way you will get Stealth too as it is applied around the field you blasted, and the bombs you shoot with Shortbow 2 have travel time which is minimalized when you are within the field (this is important because you are trying to blast as much as possible in a short frame).
---
Be prepared.
---
We were told he was attacked and lured with airships and charges, but those weren't set with ~~dragonsblood~~ brandedblood weaponry as far as we know. So they shouldn't have hurt him all that much - far less than the damage to his neck and face.
---
i dont know what games you have been playing but eu is more active in pretty much every game i play, including gw2
---
You can buy gear on the trading post up to exotic tier (second best)
---
Normally people would recommend you use berserker's gear (power+precision+ferocity, you can also buy a set of armor called devona's on the trading post), but the problem there is that berserker builds are very squishy, so jumping in unawares to end game content with berserker is a good way to get yourself killed, so that does rely heavily on you knowing how to play well
---
As another choice that's more durable but sacrifices some damage, Valkyrie is a gear set that you can buy (power+vitality+ferocity), but it's not cheap for new players
---
And a third option which you have to craft is Marauder's gear (power+precision+vitality+ferocity), which sacrifices a little bit of damage to gain some life, but not as much as Valkyrie
---
You're all wrong, because [this](https://i.imgur.com/ASogRFn.jpg) is how it's going to end.
---
Oops forgot to mention that was referring to the sickle. You end up spending more time per strike if the node is giving only a single gathering strike.
---
Except for the fact we've been told time and time again that she left.
---
It also wouldn't make any sense for Jennah to be Lyssa and Jennah hasn't done anything greater than other great mortal mesmers and necromancers.
---
Hello, I was thinking of getting game to replace WoW for awhile and I was wondering how costly is this game and is there something similar to a magic knight(ex from WoW: Ret Paladin, Enh Shaman, Frost DK) in it's class selections? Thank you for your time.
---
Where is this image taken? :o
---
People are stupid thats why
---
No.
---
Truthfully and that may sound harsh but the original VA for the female charr is the reason I legit could not play my female charrs (and for me it's the whole thing, not just post-HoT). I could not stand it at all. If they do not modulate her voice too much through post-production, I think she sounds 100000% better.
---
You're only level 32, be patient.
---
The personal story that you get every 10 levels starts out slowish... but that's because it's not the story of the world, really, it's the story of *you*, and sets up how *you* get involved in the wider plot of the game world. You're just a baby who hasn't become "somebody" yet. That takes time -- and it's something I personally appreciate in a story, actually, though I'm sure it's not everyone's cup of tea.
---
It gets gradually bigger as you go, and the end of the personal story sets you up into the Living World seasons and expansions, which continue the much larger and deeper story of Tyria as a whole, with you as a major player in that story.
---
yes sir :)
---
Don't waste your time, staff is trash on Elem since the nerfs. Plus, i don't think that aura is a reliable way to buff your party in PvE, i remember the Auramancer but it was in sPvP (was fun to play tho).
---
They expect you to carry them.
---
Inb4 we kill it with cannons on an airship.
---
I always think of how nice this community is but then i enter the official forums and i get a headache.
---
Staff is strictly inferior to x/wh in everything but pure healing output. With wh perma 25 might is ezmode.
---
About the priorities I'm not sure. Also note that since Fire Aura was renamed a while ago it doesn't interact with traits anymore. As in for exampe Feel the Burn gives the aura to allies but no vigor and regen from Invigorating Torrents.
---
We're gonna need a big blender.
---
Yeah the sylvari VA are my absolute favourite.
---
the silent people i meet are sometimes cuz of loading screens/swapping character. or clicked wrong lfg or just shy. Oh and sometimes it’s just they dont know english.
---
My impression is new players &amp; very casual players do not bother reading. It seems they just don't read LFG or don't read chat at all which makes no sense to me because that's not some ellusive gaming thing... that's just something basic you do when you're online; you read! 
---
If they fail to communicate, I just boot them because it's highly frustrating. If you can't reply to me and you've joined my group for more than 5 minutes, you're not here to be a productive part of the group.
---
All legendaries use 77 mystic clovers, regardless of whether they're 1 or 2-handed, IIRC.
---
Whether the item can be used in both hands or not depends on your class/build, not the item -- as it is, only engineer and thief can use a pistol in both main and offhand.
---
Gen 2 legendaries can be a pain, but if you like the look of HOPE, I highly recommend it. I have both HOPE and Quip, and I love both of them, but HOPE will always be near and dear to my heart because of the journey of making it. And the footfalls are really nice.
---
It fluctuates even when I'm stood  still. Thanks a lot for the reply and links, I'll have a look through them
---
For the whole purpose of making farming stuff more valuable would crafting gen 1 legendary weapons the best craft to gold one can possibly achieve?
---
Best I can do is one for Source Filmmaker.
---
As a single item it can be. But you can also lose money doing it if you're not careful.
---
Mind if I link to it?
---
This might make a little more sense for Caithe, if ya known what I mean. She has a knack for the unexpected
---
If they do that, I'd actually quite prefer it if it all goes to Glint, and then she comes back and explains that we must work to find a way to bring Vlast and Aurene back to replace Mordry and Zhaitan.
---
&gt; Three. Twelve divided by 4 is 3
---
You said nearly. 2 is nearly 3.
---
If they're new players: checking stuff out, being confused by everything, doing try and error with the games functions and see where it goes.  
---
I do that in big squads where it doesn't matter whether I'm there or not. In small groups, not so much.
---
That would actually be amazing if each of the gods became the replacements for the Elder Dragons. If that were possible, I think I'd like that (though I do have a bias as my main is a human).
---
but following your guide will avoid this inefficiencies and make it very profitable?
---
After reading Ghosts of Ascalon when it came out I always wanted to see Almorra take kralk down after what happened to her warband.
---
As long as you play around EU prime, EU is far more active than NA for pvp / wvw / raids. EU still pretty dead compared to a few years ago tho.
---
I've learned a long while ago that many people not only do not read LFG descriptions (such as what path you want to do, if you want a speed clear, etc), but also do not even bother reading LFG tabs. It sucks, but nothing can be made to fix that unfortunately.
---
 Agree the language barrier is the most common situation. Most just don't talk if they dont understand what you are saying.
---
I can recommend gen1 as first craft. Made incinerator, loved it. Nevermore a couple months later and that one was tough but still worth it. On my fifth lege now. It's a really nice goal tl have and work towards! :)
---
I didn't trust Glint so I killed her in Prophesies. (guess that's not canon though, despite, well,  [https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The\_Dragon%27s\_Lair#Bonus](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The_Dragon%27s_Lair#Bonus) )
---
I'm slow guys.. what's the connotation behind the happy blood emoji?
---
NVM I'm dumb. Blend aurene for new dragons blood weapon got it.
---
I had sound issues with game few years ago, though I'm not sure about details now. What I had to do, was to go to system tray, right click on the volume icon, choose "sounds", go to communication tab and disable automatic volume adjustment while using voice chat.
---
The other thing could be driver issue, as mentioned in the thread. 
---
What else I'd check is If you're using both speakers and headphones, go to game settings audio tab and from device selection choose the one you actually want your game to play on (instead of automatic "default").
---
Hype! \o/
---
On your #3, I always imagined that the reason magic didn't explode out was because the Mouth of Mordremoth that's killed in the instance is not fully him (just like the Mouths and Eyes of Zhaitan weren't actually him.) Remember, it's revealed that Mordry was the entire jungle, and it's speculated in-game that his mind was both the Dream and the Nightmare and beyond.
---
If anyone has any questions, you can always ask here or message me privately on reddit or in-game. My in-game name is Lelling.6795 (or just Lelling, I have a character with that name so that works too \^\^)
---
I don't know how to read minds, but my boot does.
---
Since when? It is (or was?) something you could get from doing one of the hearts in Sandswept isles. Did that change?
---
It starts off slow but gets better and better as it goes.  I waited and did it all in order instead of every ten levels.  That helped.  Also, I was so lost when I went from My Story to Heart of Thorns so I bought season 2, went back and watched season 1 movie on youtube (this really helped because it introduces you to everyone, but you can't play it anymore in game unfortunately) and then did the whole thing in order.  I really think the key is season 1, you gotta check that video out after you do your personal story.
---
I don't think I've ran into that with dungeons or fractals but I did have that one guy who was new to the game, still in Queensdale but decided to join my LFG for the last HoT story instance which means they also had to use a TTF to get there ... but even then that person wasn't silent they were just curious
---
Doesn't really make sense to expect someone doing an Arah run to carry you through Caudecus Mansion
---
Language barrier.
---
&gt; Always wonder wtf is happening in their brains.
---
Random electric signals that activate random muscles.
---
In my opinion, it's not worth it. Use the money to buy Heart of Thorns instead as it remains some of the best group content in the game.
---
Interesting. I don't recall any of that, but it makes sense. I do remember, I think the original VA was John DiMaggio's (VA for Canach) wife? But she's much less prolific (or more private, maybe), so I was unable to find much info on her when I've investigated in the past.
---
I feel like I would have noticed if there was a change in VA in the records if what you say is true, but it's also entirely possible I missed it.
---
Now I'm really curious.
---
I now want this skin!
---
Thanks, I was really struggling to choose my first legendary to craft, but knowing I’ll be able to reuse the skin is comforting! :)
---
After further reasearch, spurred by your comment, here are my 3 things:
---
About your First thing: I guess I was wrong in this regard, interpreting as him being able to regenerate his form an indicator of it not being his body. 
---
About your Second thing: I was mistaken, as the Dream and Nightmare work as (imperfect) barriers against Mordremoth, showing that he's not the source. 
---
About your Third thing: Ah, I guess I misunderstood. Sorry bout that. 
---
In conclusion, wow, I need to do some research.
---
Stop mashing maybe? I dono. Sounds pretty ineffective.
---
RemindMe! 1 Day
---
All I want to know is if ANYONE at all got a single infusion
---
Hello everyone, 
---
before I ask, I thought I let you guys know that this is my very first MMO game (which I am greatly enjoying) and I feel lost after completing the story all the way to Living World Season 4 All or Nothing. It probably wasn't wise to just follow the story missions but I did not see any other objectives to follow while leveling.
---
I wanted to know what my options are going forward after I finished the story. If there are up to date videos or guides I can look at on the internet, I will greatly appreciate it.
---
For the skin and the shiny. Also a good way for me to keep my material storage managed better.
---
I'm in this boat as well. I wanted the Skin and it was a personal achievement of mine. The ability to stat swap was an added bonus.
---
Good thing that they didn't need to actually R E A D the lfg they were joining, or that language barrier might have hurt them too!
---
Bloodletting for a few hundred years. Sounds fun...  
---
Store it at Droknars forge, cold enough.
---
Sword that looks like a sword. Lightning everywhere. 2 damn lightning dragons spiraled up the blade. Not crap footfalls like the other. Super flashy lightning aura on character instead of just on 1 arm
---
From the moment I first saw Twilight, I wanted it. I was a noob with random stat trash gear and I didnt care about any of that. Now I have Twilight, Astralaria, The Dreamer, Rodgort, Meteorlogicus, Incinerator, and Bolt. I did the rest mostly for the skins and a little for the stat swap.
---
honestly, i maxed my MF in just a few months when the pertinent update was released without having to salvage a single ecto. It probably helped that i opened lots of ToT bags but i wouldn't have taken much longer to max it anyway.
---
If it wasn't because there's certain recipes that use luck as an ingredient i would be grateful if anet made luck items to stop dropping after you have maxed item. Its a hassle. I know that on the last lunar festival there was a way to convert it to gold but having to go one by one is a hassle too. If there's no way to exchange all i would still prefer for luck to stop dropping.
---
It started with "I like the skin" and ended with "Hmm I think I should have at least one of every type"
---
Because I could.
---
As meh as the core story is I liked it 10x better than ffxiv story. It does get better tho once you get into LS and expansion story. Big fan of pof story and its probably one of my favorite stories in an mmo.
---
Dreamer/Bifrost - Because the thought of a Daredevil Charr with super saiyan hair wielding rainbow weapons sounded hilarious. Catmander tag made it complete.
---
Astralaria - Because I switched from Daredevil main to Mirage main and seeing the starfield trail of Astralaria fly all over the screen when 3 clones all all using it looks incredible.
---
Exordium - As another user said, it is Mesmer as fuck and in open world you have to have a greatsword for ranged/tagging. Love the design and also thinking of maybe finally making a guardian to actually play with it to instead of my current guardian who is just a storage toon.
---
In the future I would like to make Shining Blade and HOPE but not in any rush for them.
---
Exactly!  And there were a bunch of other odds and ends I had collected thinking they were for some important quests.. but ended up just being silly heart turn-ins or useless trophies/collection items.
---
Salty vets that can't bare their poor wittle eyes see anything that could be a potentially negative thing said about their game. =)
---
As I said, there was a three year period between core launch and Heart of Thorns where Arenanet was exclusively using dialog text instead of voice acting.  Since the actor never did the female charr voice for that entire three year period, they forgot how they had done it and had to basically start over creating a new voice that ended up being similar but not entirely the same.
---
Honestly don't understand how people find enjoyment in scrapper? God its boring.  
---
Engineer used to be the complex high skill cap profession before HoT came along(except that turret noobstomp shit).  
---
Scrapper is just boring as hell. Then again so is holo so meh.
---
Good point, and then it instantly got corrupted when mordemoth emerged 
---
She has great powers, but the power to contain an elder dragon's power and help regulate the flow of magic throughout the world she does not have
---
For all we know right now, shes still severely hurt since she came out of her coma
---
Not really. Most of its frontloaded damage has been nerfed. Its now got decent but not great burst. 
---
What sets it apart from other classes that burst is that it has amazing cc and cleave.
---
Yeah, whether or not the made it, they approved it, and that’s what is terrifying.
---
I won't be able to make the meeting, but would love an update on the details that are discussed!
---
Oh, my bad. I looked back at your earlier comment. I had misread it, thinking you were suggesting the VA changed between launch and HoT, not just the voice itself.
---
&gt;Does the ground below me determine my maximum height or does my point of taking off determine my maximum hover height?  
---
I think it's the latter. Take a look at [this part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSsYjDIe3bQ&amp;t=2295s). When using Arial Rescue, the "flight juice" was at its maximum value even though the ground was pretty far away. The bar didn't drop either until the mount started moving away from its "origin point".
---
Technically, considering that Bond of Faith can be used to change the "origin point" while still airborne, it should be possible to gain infinite altitude a bit too easily. I assume they know about that and that they did something to prevent it somehow. We just won't know for sure until the mount is released next Tuesday.
---
Too bad it will only be sold with a pack of 4 other Warclaw skins for an outrageously high price(if you only want that skin).
---
sure, but what i'm saying is why would they add limits they technically don't have to
---
Variety of gameplay.
---
Future projects of ANet were canned - layoffs were a consequence of that from my understanding (as many were working on said projects instead of GW2). NCSoft wants ANet to focus on GW2, so it won't be dying anytime soon. They moved a lot of staff back onto GW2.
---
Why no one search? Like this is the third time today someone asked the same thing. And no its not gonna die any time soon.
---
I think you mean the PvE community
---
For the Silverwastes just look for RIBA groups and they'll show you the ropes.
---
Twilight because it’s a huge fucking sword with a galaxy in it, who wouldn’t want that?
---
I’m looking into crafting sunrise to make eternity because that’s even cooler or maybe Astralia or whatever the space axe is called.
---
I probably will make the shield with the quaggan in it because it looks cute
---
Same! All of the above and also I'm doing that for warrior.  I already have 1 of each legendary weapon type but I've also done both Long bows, Eternity, and now Exordium. I may or may not craft Sharur since I already have Juggernaut but I will craft Rodgort even though I already have Flames of War.
---
Yes, pretty major ones at that. You can change your language in the options menu so you don't know what's going on and then just not pay attention. It's technically the second story mission that is the real one for the raptor, the first one is a bunch of setup and conversation in Lion's Arch. It should be mentioned that someone else can start the 2nd mission and you can join in at any level and just let them clear it for you. I always offer to help people get the first mount if they want it early or don't want to spoil the story.
---
There are only a few total bosses that take actual invested effort in core tyria.  Tripple Trouble Wurms, Shatterer, and Tequatl are the three that immediately come to mind.  Even still, people tend to gather at the place the boss spawns and just press 1 for loot.
---
Yup, get both expansions and if you do decide to upgrade to the deluxe they are on [a separate sale until the 16th](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/fashion-magic-with-etherbound-gauntlets/) so you have some time to decide.
---
I play both and I'm up to date with both stories, if you've played FFXIV past the base game and got to experience the expansion content, GW2's story is going to feel a little bit lame. I say this as someone who loves the lore in the Guild Wars universe, but they've never really hit the mark with story telling in both GW1 or GW2. It feels like there's a secret they're trying to save about the dragons until a big moment, but it's been 6 years now and we've never really got much information about them. If there isn't a secret about them and it's just what we see, it's starting to feel very anti-climactic.
---
Compared to what's about to happen with FFXIV's next expansion where the huge plot points and mysteries that were introduced in the very earliest parts of the game are about to have massive repercussions and (I think) everything we understood about the game story may about to be flipped on its head in true Final Fantasy style, GW2 just kind of plods along, even though fighting city-sized, all-powerful dragons should be quite exciting.
---
Don't let that put you off though, GW2 is a great game that's fun to play.
---
[This guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character) has a lot of details on gearing up. I highly suggest getting berserker exotic gear first. As was mentioned, getting the cheap[ named armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Named_armor) is the cheapest and best option starting out.
---
If I went full dps like berserker I can guarantee you I would have instantly died
---
Dont think it would be a problem, currently have Armor, Aurora, Ascension, Bolt, Chuka and Chumpawat, Incinerator, everything for Quip and HOPE, Raven staff for Nevermore and 10k gold just sitting about, so it's not too hard to begin with ;D
---
Kralkatorrik wouldn't get stuck in the same manner. He's a magic-absorbing entity who is also capable of mind control. 
---
After a few cycles, instead of killing Dr. Strange, he'd try branding him which would almost definitely work. If that somehow didn't work, eating (more like inhaling) him and possibly absorbing the time magic very well could.
---
Daredevil elite skill is a finisher skill, that's probably what they're using
---
Basically this, never having to ever get new gear (apart from elite specs getting a new weapon) on my main is my long term goal.
---
The fact that I like the weapons (hate infusions and other shiny stuff) is an added bonus.
---
Blendtec, ANet is sponsering a new "will it blend" video to help them resurrect their youtube channel. Those companies it trouble gotta stick together
---
I'd say take rebel anyways on power, if you have 1 chrono in the other sub squad that's fine and you can let them know to take mimic instead of well of recall as you'll be providing 10 man alacrity. This is mentioned in the [chronomancer guide](https://snowcrows.com/raids/guides/mesmer/chronomancer/support/) under the utility and variation section. You can also see your details listed in the [alacrity renegade section](https://snowcrows.com/raids/guides/revenant/renegade/alacrity/). The one thing is that you're hopefully running with a firebrand in your sub squad for quickness, if you're running double chronomancer then you're not getting any benefit from renegade really. It would be better to swap to an actual power DPS at that point or ask a chrono to be replaced by a quickness firebrand.
---
Thanks for replying and that wall of text :) I was wondering if you might clarify something. Is living world some kind of expansion event that concludes the current expac and leads you to the next major one or is it it's own mini expansion that takes place between each major? One last thing, can Necromancers be built to not use pets(hate pet classes) and can firebrand be built to use ether a hammer or sword and shield? If not, the Elementalist weaver might be up my alley Or Berserker, that looked fun too.
---
so Impact strike is a finsher skill?
---
Never heard of finisher skills that insta down you before...
---
Not counter the Warrior elite banner that recently got changed
---
Seriously the first time i completed that mission I was so disappointed. I spent months preparing for the final fight only to sit there for half an hour spamming 1
---
I main Ele and got The Legend from the mystic forge after three months of playing. I felt like it was meant to be so I had to do it.
---
You don't need legendary gear for anything. Considering that those weapons are used mainly for CC, you can easily use exotics which are quite easy and cheap to get, whether it's for karma, dungeons or simply on trading post.
---
I finished the personal story back when gw2 released and then stopped playing. Years later I tried to continue with Season 2. 
---
I couldn’t really get into it and later just decided to play the HoT expansion and story. Took me some time to understand what was going on and who all these characters were but the storytelling was way better than before. Your character is voice acted and has a lot more lines, and there’s no clunky dialogue cutscenes anymore. 
---
With time I started to get sucked back into the world, started to care a lot for the characters and just really enjoyed the story. From HoT on, their way of storytelling just kept on improving. Obviously I went back to Season 2 and played through that as well. 
---
trust me, soon you’ll be one of these people really looking forward to new living world episodes because of the story
---
Legendary have the same stats numbers that ascended, so you don't need legendary, you will be okay even with exotics. The difference between ascended and exotic is minimal.
---
It doesn't really get any better. For a story based mmo the GW2 writing is quite poor.
---
In raids, they are not new players. You cant even access raid lfg if youre not 80. So if they dont whisper you back, even tho they are clearly online, kick them. From my personal experience, I've tried a few times, reason with them, doesn't work.
---
Idk why people undervite you for telling the truth. Reddit is weird sometimes.
---
That's also what I'm hoping for because the further we're going ahead, having new stuff the worse lack of Season 1 content looks like for the game and no video, NPC dialogues, fractal instances or map scenery (Kessex Hills tower) can fix that.
---
I wouldn't mind if they either would fully devote S5 to deliver S1 or partially, or in alternated way (S5 episode then S1 episode, S5 and so on) but that should be done already.
---
Coz I enjoy silence.
---
Yes. My goal is to craft all of the Legendary equipment.
---
It's worth playing now more than ever before.
---
wasn't there a new version May 10th? maybe your version is out of date and this is the cause? (just a guess)
---
Please ANet give us a deus ex machina "Aurena is still alive" thing ..
---
Latest is 4/25
---
I'm crafting all the legendaries my elementalist can equip. I have everything except the weapons (with the exception of Nevermore and Kraitkin).
---
I still remember when I made Kraitkin in Lion's Arch. I had no idea people could be so passionate on their hatred of crafting a legendary weapon lol
---
Too soon
---
Oh my god the second one would be incredible.
---
Do you really need internet points this bad?
---
Option A: You die, your children die, and one of their bodies is posthumously turned into a weapon. The world is saved.
---
Option B: The universe disintegrates.
---
Whispers: Wjy you kik me?
---
For Chuka it was for the skin, Claw for the lore tied to it, the rest to give me something to do and sell.
---
I've actually done the first tier of all legendary weapons for fun, but haven't felt the need to go after most skins—ascended gear works for me. So I flip 'em.
---
No-one likes being told their class is bad.
---
thank you!! :D took me awhile
---
RIP Chordall's inbox
---
thank you!!! &lt;3
---
Same. I craft the ones I like the skins for, the stat-swap is really nice to have, and I enjoy the accomplishment of completing them.
---
At level 32 you're almost about the point where the personal story changes into the "real" story; the bit that will last til the end of the main/base campaign. Basically everything before you get to the "three orders" stuff is just kind of background/character filler (but it is unique based not just on your race but also your starting character choices, so a ton of replayability in the first 30/40 levels story-wise for alts).
---
That said, story presentation in GW2 is a little different than FF14. Partly because of how the game has changed since launch, and partly just because of the way GW2 was built.
---
From 0 to 80 you will really be able to experience THREE main stories that inter-weave, if you want. There is the "personal story" (main story/green quests); there is the "dungeon story" (aka the Destiny's Edge story) which eventually crosses over with the personal story quite a bit but is very easy to miss, and there is the "race story".
---
The personal story is very traditional; presented in quests, etc. These are the green quests you get in your journal.
---
The dungeon story is much more just about doing all the dungeons at level in story mode and watching the cutscenes, as well as listening to the NPC dialog and talking to them.
---
The race story (actually plural because there are 4-ish) is basically a collection of "map stories", and is told *very* non-traditionally, but is maybe my favorite part of base GW2.
---
The important note here is that every map has a distinct and consistent story taking place. For instance, if you go to Queensdale and do the hearts in order and talk to the heart vendors and generally follow the various event chains through the map that you'll encounter while going through the map in that rough order, you will experience a complete narrative journey. In particular, the "telescope" scouts give a great overview for each map story and its key hearts/rough intended order at a super-high level.
---
It is particularly important to listen before and after events to the friendly NPCs to fully experience this part. They have a lot of "local" chatter immediately preceding or following events where a ton of the narrative happens. As well as the various flavour chatter NPCs have at the different camps/outposts. This story is not particularly linear or possible to follow completely from start to end; you kind of just drop in/out of it as you overhear things and travel across the map. It feels very real and organic as a result.
---
Each main race (mostly) has an over-arching narrative that is told through their map stories. So for humans, if you go Queensdale -&gt; Kessex Hills -&gt; Gendarran Fields -&gt; Harathi Hinterlands, and follow the map stories, you will experience an interesting overall narrative taking place about the Krytan/human kingdom and its issues.
---
Also, for each map that has a dungeon, the map story generally leads into the related dungeon story and how it connects with Destiny's Edge (which, as I mentioned, is a story that itself will eventually overlap with the Personal Story).
---
But that stuff is easy to miss if you are just in a hurry to level. The nice thing is based on the level scaling for the game, there's no big loss by staying in a map you have "out leveled". You don't need to feel like you should 100% complete every single map before moving on, of course, but you will not be XP punished unlike other MMO's, because of the way the GW2 scaling works.
---
So if story immersion is an important aspect for you then I strongly suggest slowing down and not just going straight to the next green dot. Instead, explore the maps/events between one green quest and the next one. Talk to the scouts and hearts and you'll eventually get to the next green quest "naturally", listening to NPC's, doing hearts, and paying attention to events on the way. This is much closer to how the game played out at launch. (Generally speaking, 0 to 50-ish, the main story will skip you through your racial maps, so if you are human then getting to the next "green dot" will generally involve traversing the sequence of human maps, etc.)
---
I'm sorry its been 5 months we don't need spoiler tags.
---
Works fine for me but ... do you really need to know the health accurate to a hundredth of a percent?
---
There is a thing around the platform that disables using Portal so that is probably related.
---
Yeh that trailer had some nice visuals to work with. :) 
---
Also my favourite.
---
does Superior Rune of Sanctuary work with the new healing from the reaper trait Soul Eater
---
Really? I heard that about Patriarch (something about the eggs being too trivial with portals), and even then couldn't find the proof for that.  
---
But for Matriarch? Why would portals be disabled there?
---
If the logo is stolen art that they badly mashed together without even removing all the white background I would not get a tattoo there.
---
Can I suggest [Rainbow Railroad](https://www.rainbowrailroad.com/) to support this year? It is an NGO that works to help LGBT refugees fleeing persecution and genocide.
---
Or a similar group?
---
AP is a reliable indicator of gameplay time, and by extension experience IMO. I haven't met with much 6k AP players with 200 kp myself. So it helps as a general indicator of knowledge rather than absolute proof.
---
Consider it like BMI. Normally high BMI would indicate someone is in an unhealthy weight, but there are exceptions to the rule such as heavy weightlifters with low fat percentage. This doesn't make BMI invalid though, as it still works with the normal population.
---
By the way, my case only applies to those who were making the group. It is usually the case that those who made the group (or were in the group as others join) do not get asked for kp. So there is greater room for one to leech if they are making the party or were in the party beforehand.
---
So if someone with 6k ap joined my party, I would ask them to link kp just like everyone else and make my judgment then. But the fact in my case one of the people in the lfg asked for 200kp with 6k ap made me wonder, and upon questioning the said person failed to link kp themselves.  
---
Either way, please do not take this as a personal insult. I feel like you and the other guy kinda took it as 'low AP guys are noobs/skilless', probably due to my wording in original comment. Its just that such cases are rather uncommon.
---
We do Tequatl every night at reset--Come, join us! I am testybest.4103 in game :)
---
We also did a number on Kralk and took out an eye; the room is probably covered with his blood. But there is one small issue... The forge was powered by Aurene.
---
I have to remember to come raid this event.
---
Alright, Thanks everyone. Downloading it now and will definitely try it out again!
---
Yes.
---
Missing some GvGs on your youtube channel( VR vs TE and VR vs PMA)
---
What Acer Nitro do you have? Or more specifically, what GPU and CPU does it have? Is it the GTX 1050Ti i7-7700HQ model?
---
GW2 may not be the most optimized game, but it isn't total garbage either like some people are implying. And if you have the Nitro model with that mentioned GPU/CPU combo, it'll be way better than average.
---
I'm not sure what to suggest directly for GW2 if FFIX/ESO/BDO all work fine, but here's some general stuff:
---
* Use a SSD (the Acer computers I've seen ship with some useless 5400 RPM drive; a $20 120GB SSD is worlds better overall and is noticeable in GW2)
---
* Use the latest NVIDIA graphics driver from NVIDIA's website (don't get it from Acer nor Windows Update)
---
* Toggle Hyper-threading (enable it if it's disabled, and disable it if it'e enabled; this would be a BIOS option)
---
* Make sure you aren't being thermal throttled (I had an Acer Predator Helios 300 that would thermal throttle on the CPU super easily with GW2; had to undervolt to get it to maintain decent FPS)
---
* Close all unnessary programs (the usual stuff like Steam, Discord, Firefox/Chrome/Edge/Browser, video/music players, etc; no need for anything deep like random Windows processes or services)
---
* Make sure there's no malware eating resources (like a crypto-miner)
---
No portal works fine in that.
---
I think tag is assigned based in title. I assume "update" = news tag
---
I can't think of a reason but it sticks out in my mind because there was one time when I was trying to help a friend get some HPs and that thing forced me to portal from a different spot.
---
Okay
---
Ahh the start of it all
---
Depends on why you quit, but I would say it is worth coming back.
---
I see, sad about Firebrand hammer since I have a love for war hammers when battleaxes aren't available. Really wanted to live the fantasy of smashing skulls with a hammer and purging the unworthy with holy fire, ah well. Maybe I'll give that greatsword quickbrand build I found a look over before I look into Weaver and Reaper. Thanks for all your help!
