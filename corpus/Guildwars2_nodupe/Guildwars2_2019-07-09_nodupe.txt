Ah yes, this bug. Rev has had this bug since launch, so welcome and have a drink. You’ll be here awhile.
---
---
---
You are truly one sophisticated person. Above all us plebs, for sure.
---
That... wasn’t what I expected
---
I don't need a key for myself but I'd love one for my mate so he'd get back into the game.
---
Yeah, reporting the exploit itself isn't going to get anyone's account gimped, fairly low chance of it happening but even then a possibility is still one despite how slim your pickings are, but generally speaking, the exploits you mentioned did get fixed as those content typically are permanent additions to the game unlike these temporary events that we're unlikely to ever see again. Like AB multimap wasn't much of an exploit for the meta itself but the map hopping mechanic brought about by megaservers, the perma TP to friend was basically flawed from the start with its character-bound cooldowns that let people make and delete alts.
---

---
But yeah, not saying that they're going to get banned or suspended or that reporting the exploit would have ANet actually do anything, but its still good practice to report the exploits.
---
Do yourself a favour and grab at least the copper-fed salvage machine if you can. I appreciate the cleanliness of your inventory, that said. I'm eternally 40/90 on every alt for various reasons.
---
My commander is a mordremvari and id love to have her look the part in game!

Thread removed: Begging is not allowed.

Though real answer to your rhetorical title: GW2's marketing. Or to say the lack of it.
---
[Sums up the old GW2 marketing team pretty nicely](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/038/787/4d4.jpg).
---
They're not that great now either, but they have at least come a long way.
---
I'm pretty sure no one wants to admit that they remember this....
---
No why would it?
---
They tend to experiment in collage
---
They should make it more expensive imo, and bring back repair costs, why they even removed it is beyond me. This game has become way too lazy.
---
Ok thank you for info \^\^
---
Hmm thats a good point remember there was that reddit post about someone who got an email to go and play test GW2. So what if this poster was one of those people and they just broke NDA.
---
im a student who love playing gw2. right now all I have is core game. 
---
During the living world season 4 episodes free from gem store back in winter/early spring I were able to get episode one for free, but non of the others. idk if it was intentional from anet or not, but it cant be played without Path of fire which I dont own. 
---
I hope to win a key from your giveaway so i get to experience more of gw2. regardless, thx for doing this giveaway.
---
Only 90? Tsk. Tsk. Tsk.
---
Yes I am a vandal chased by the police. nice to see that gw2 ads hit the proper target demographic.
---
You guys are forgetting that warframe still sets the example, they are a f2p game as well with platinum currency that barely serves anything other than mods, prime parts and cosmetics. Oh and they can be also earned via trading. 
---
They dont have over the top lootboxes, in fact they are useless, and they actually give out platinum on twitch drops. 
---
If you are telling me a gmae that has 2 expansion packs, mount cosmetics and rng chests cant sustain itself you are dead wrong. The first thing that will deplend this game from popularity is lack of content.
---
Festivals need to be a thing, they give out useful currency and some actually good things to get, AND MAYBE SOME MOUNT SKINS AS A REWARD IN GAME EH?
---
...If any thet have gotten worse.
---
Remmember the Bubble Tea promotion? Or posting those GW2 printed adds on shady pizza barns and liquor stores?
---
&gt; Anet has a ton of super rare infusions that 99% of the game will never attain and that is a flaw imo.
---
It's not a flaw if they're tradeable on the TP. I agree it would be nice to have another way for players to work towards them, but saving up gold is always an option.
---
It's more of a problem for the Aurene / Tequatl weapons, which are account-bound and reliant on extreme RNG, making it nearly impossible for a single player to collect all of them. That's a mistake in my opinion.
---
This is the trailer that DE had made for Warframe:
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx6xnP2chG4
---
BTW warframe is free to play, no lootboxes! And cosmetic items or cosmetic related items in their shop only + quite often 25, 50 or 75% off (for buying gems/Plat) as daily login reward.
---
There's very minor implication it was to go a step further. I wouldn't call it cut content though. More accurately unfinished like so many other things.
---
okay but... paste the title of this into the search bar of this sub and tell me what happens.
---
ANet actually told us outright that Malyck was originally planned to be part of HoT. That is 100% confirmee cut content. They also said its possible he'll be part of a future plot.
---
And there is dialogue implying another step of reprecussions after A Burden of Choice.
---
You'd be surprised how much content they seed in and go nowhere with ever since the days of Prophecies.
---
It didn't fit because of the "race against the clock" theme for saving Destiny's Edge that they planted for it. They already had two sidetracking with Tarir and Novus and didn't want more so they scrapped the Nightmare Court and Malyck plots.
---
Just try something you may like better. I would suggest trying all possible weapons for any class you try.
---
It's bullshit since GW2 just fell into the cash shop mold anyway. Loot boxes, artificial scarcity, and more!
---
&gt;What avenue of PvE content is PVT armor EVER justified?
---
Open world and story mode. Works fine for both and is a good set of casual gear. They can go shopping once they decide on a build or want to do something tougher.
---
Like another commenter, I have PoF but my husband doesn't. He plays on a free account and is currently leveling his two characters faithfully, but has recently been eyeing going into new maps with me so we can adventure together. I'd love to be able to bring him on the journey with me. :)
---
The reason companies switch away from the subscription model is because they can make more money with MTX. I am not business expert but how would reducing income result in increased content being produced?
---
Hey, as i said in the giveaway for the other guy, i want it for a friend who has hot only right now,  it would be a great gift and much appreciated 
---
Thanks for doing this no matter who you choose ^^
---
Never seen that before. Chinese Fear Not This Night is beautiful. I see a change in lyrics, too.
---
Its a leg sleeve
---
Sleeg
---
It was also the trailer that first made me go "And I am a fanboy of this franchise? -facepalm-".
---
More like yearly remember of what should have been forgotten, lol.
---
&gt;1 in 100,000 (0.001%).
---
0.001% = 1 in 1,000 chance.  Those would be nicer odds.
---
Ah, you're right.  I was taking the numbers directly instead of converting.
---
I would like to see the ending of this story too. But I also appreciate stories with no ending in game cause it can be used in  later games. Like how we never knew the ending of what happened to the founder of the white mantle I  GW1 until HoT raiding.
---
I'm sure we're all wondering it, so i'll just come out and say it...
---
...who are you again?
---
No it likely means season 5 is 8 months long. Anet would be killing GW2 if living world is 8 months away. Especially seeing as episode 1 of season 5 would have been in development since after a star to guide us was released. Episode 1 of season 5 feature wise needs to be big to reinvigorate the living world concept.
---
&gt; "really really really fucking low"
---
this is a prime example of the kind of place that invisible walls shouldnt exist
---
Who else would you put on green? The group healer?
---
Ty for this. I lile guild wars 2 cuz i love my asura...he is an angi and is the character that i m most proud of doing in a game.
---
1) that's probably more of an indictment against your fellow group members, and 2) you'd probably be even higher if you played DH.
---
Back in my day, we had to pay to repair our armor
---
One thing that has changed is the seasonal events! Dragon bash is going on right now in the city of hoelbrak and I suggest you check it out!
---
&gt; PVT made sense in that context, but why the stat choice hasn't been updated, I have no idea.
---
Lvl 80 boosters came with HoT. 
---
It's 3 years between Lvl boost release and what you describe.
---
LOL YOU GOT KICKED OUT OF A DEMIOS SQUAD...... IN A CASUAL GAME!!! Wow you must be really bad at videogames. Omegalol what a loser. Tell us the details, did you step on an oil, get knocked off before the event even started? What happened that turned you into such a little pussy?
---
My favourite is how the cubs stack with backpacks. They even show up with tonic transformations! It's hilarious to have a tiny tiger hanging on the back of huge Nuhoch xD

&gt; The only "gain" I could see from this kind of appeal would be towards streamers serving as promoters as psuedo-marketing, but that is a very fickle pursuit. They would be better off investing in more traditional marketing campaigns.
---
That could also end up getting views for the streamer without having any significant impact to your player population.
---
I was there. Getting back into things now is a little overwhelming
---
Knowing your audience I guess, America got a silly one with a popular actor, Japan got Anime.   Silly commercials for sure though.  That said if we are comparing launch trailers that would be [this](https://youtu.be/4tyuIh12_HU ).  Though SE had some weird promotions in the past like with the weird honey buns that got you in game food.
---
Shadowbringers has had pretty solid marketing by comparison, also been seeing a lot of advertisements in major cities as well as Times Square and such.
---
8?
---
I would say one thing changed: there are semi regular expansion discounts and even giveaways (one is currently going in another thread I think), so you now have increased chances to snatch an expansion for free or super cheap.
---
game of thrones lol. amazing season in every regard except the writing, and the only people being blamed for it are D&amp;D, rightfully so after even hearing the cast come out about working with D&amp;D behind the scenes.
---
Not as bad as the taxi promotion.
---
Marketing team been killin it since day 1
---
You have to remember D&amp;D got their instructions on how GoT end from GRR Martin himself. GRRM is probably a passionate man, will you agree? The conversation they had was probably rather extensive, will you agree? Every major thing that happaned I’m willing to bet was GRRMs idea. D&amp;D rushed it no doubt, mostly because they probably wanted to be loyal to whatever shit GRRM told them.
---
Literally just disable them in PVP. Christ.
---
It really depends at what time youre playing, and which LFG youre looking into. There wont be many ppl in maps where nothing is happening, and there wont be many ppl online at night hours.
---
Wait no more, back when i was younger, i get 💯 % map completion without mount.. and glider too
---
They should do something with this. There are even updrafts that suggest you were supposed to go up there at some point. Even just that swinging kid?
---
Had to rewrite thing way too many times ... but how do we know people are not happy to buy cosmetics in GW2?
---
Your world population makes an impact only in WvW, for everything else we have something called mega-servers, where we play with everyone regardless of server. Try to get on time with the events using https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Event_timers
---
It did!  Definitely loaded several seconds faster than before. :D
---
the market of BoP Exotics?
---
Well at least we're not the only ones with insane marketing attempts that make no sense and almost entirely fail to advertise the product.
---
Where is this vendor? I've tried the general raid merchant, as well as talking to Glenna in various raid wings, and only found a LD -&gt; LI conversion. Is there some precondition I have to meet before this is available?
---
What you said would make sense if we didnt play a game where in pve 95% of incoming damage and simply be avoided or easily mitigated, why would you need the extra vitality and toughness on anything in PvE when you can simple dodge or move out the way.
---
The first minute and a half had nothing to do with GW2 in the slightest.
---
I wish we had that kind of curved sword.
---
Pretty sure it was only offer to players that did at least one boss before the change, don't think you can unlock it now. Good news is that there are now 3 wings that award LD though so it's much easier to get and wing 7 really isn't that bad.
---
I already have like 80 LI though, and have no intention of making legendary armor, so it'd be a shame to have to start from scratch.
---
The good news is that reading through the thread it seems the devs confirmed that I'll still be able to access the exchange:
---
&gt; Participation is not limited. You can earn access to the exchange after the patch as well.
---
o/
---
This is going to sound dumb as hell.  When I see those PEGI messages in games I always assumed it was some development team that the publisher outsourced to in Asia.  I thought there were so many generic dev teams that they just number them now.  This isn’t BS, realizing what it really is is an epiphany.
---
Ah well then hopefully doing a hall of chains boss unlocks it for you! Let me know if it does work for you so I know for the future too.
---
It costs like, 30g to get a full set of berserker EVERYTHING, weapons, armor, trinkets, strength runes, force/accuracy sigils. That’s just 2 weeks of ONLY DAILIES. I can understand the “maybe don’t teach people the game on toughness and vitality” argument, but not the credit card bait one.
---
To Malchor’s Leap!
---
That was...weird. Totally incongruous, like two different commercials spliced together.
---
Thanks u/MorbidEel, you’re always good at pulling up the numbers when I don’t feel like looking them up (this obviously isn’t the first time).
---
Definitely reaper. It fits my character's RP pretty well, too (disgraced hero).
---
Something something nice try anet
---
Because new players may need that safety factor for mistiming their dodges.
---
I think you're missing some qualifiers. For approved things, it goes from passion to obsession. For bad things, dependencies to addiction. Too much of even a good thing does indeed lead to a bad thing. Fixation and refusing help to remediate it is still a bad thing.
---
 The problem coming to light here is that companies are employing techniques to ramp up people's dependencies (for example, the perceived need to complete a set) into addictive behavior (just one more lootbox! It could have one I'm missing) just to make another buck from them. There's no rules in place to ensure they are playing fair on their end nor forming habits in malleable psyches - rules which the gambling industry has but gaming does not.
---
I like wvw
---
Whats your ign btw?
---
. . . Nice try, anet
---
Jokes aside, welcome to the game! It’s sick, and it takes a solid 5 years to start running out of stuff to do.
---
Again, thanks for the great comments! Glad to see GW2 has an awesome, friendly community unlike some other games (World of Whining).
---
Test, read, practice.
---
I wish I could downvote this twice. Its the most stupid thing Ive seen all week.
---
Yessss.
---
Nah, ANET won't ever finish these things because all their efforts are going into living story instances
---
I skipped ahead because I thought it was a prank. What the heck. I half expected to end up in Skyrim.
---
The market of BoEs.  If you give zerker for free, no one would buy the named/crafted ones
---
Pls don't patch. Tis my secret griffon rider council chamber D:
---
Gerne doch, hab auch Deutsch ausgewählt
---
&gt; Dany's sudden decision to start massacring hundreds of innocent people, theres definitely a problem with execution.
---
&gt; Dany's decision to start massacring hundreds [...] definitely a problem with execution
---
&gt; start massacring hundreds [...] problem with execution
---
Wait a minute...
---
I really want to play PoF for the mounts and specializations, but I hear the story is really stepping up as well!
---
To this day, I still hope they were just trolling
---
Of course it isn't an unwillingness to pay for something.  It is an unwillingness to pay for anything.  That commenter just wants the argument to fit his assumptions.  As I wrote earlier, he is being disingenuous.
---
I, personally, will spend real money on items that are available without chance as both a way to support a game I play and support the kind of transactions I am willing to engage in.
---
Yes, for a new player that's pretty much gold. But you don't actually need the griffon or the skyscale to be fast, the raptor and the rollerbeatle are very fast and you don't need real money for any mount besides PoF.
---
 Go and make your own squad where everyone performs up to your own standarts
---
But how do we know its false. We say its a bunch of shite but for all we know its true. Theres always a possibility.
---
I love the movements of the Charr in that. Shaking off the water is good, same with checking the weapon.
---
I know I would quit in a moment's notice
---
I can play about an hour or two a day and not even every day
---
I'm not so rich that I can afford giving 15 bucks a month so that I can play more or less 25-30 hours a month
---
Yep, it's very useful so that you don't feel forced to farm some specific long/annoying achiev in a single year and can actually enjoy the festival!
---
Yes, it's terrible for a company to effectively monetize their game. The cash shop here is probably fairer than the cash shop of most games. Have you ever tried to play SWTOR's end game without the "optional" sub? 
---
You know, as cash shops go, this one barely registered when compared with most other games. The only exception are sub games, which still usually have cash shops.
---
If people are going to complain about a game's cash shop, this probably isn't the one to complain about.
---
You just convinced me to give FF14 a try.
---
Thanks. Also thanks for reminding me to enjoy myself.
---
I did use reference for this - @tathariel on IG. I did get permission, and I’ll be posting this on my Instagram as well,  @tj.metamorphosis.
---
Really makes me lose faith in the leadership of their writing team. The HoT story was a fatal blow for my belief that GW2 can still do good world building post-launch (Scarlet was a mess and HoT failed to deliver the Malyck/Nightmare/Sylvari origin story that was promised since talking to Ronan in Eye of the North).
---
I'm stunned their lore/story leadership agreed to make HoT a race to Mordremoth instead of an exploration of the jungle and its inhabitants (hylek, itzel, exhalted etc), the Pact's survival, the sylvari betrayal and the mysteries of their race and the chance to explore foreign sylvari.
---
No, *all of them*.
---
Just because other games have a shitty cash shop, you really shouldn't complain about them because that still means you are playing video games instead of living in a war torn country without access to food and medicine and shelter. 
---
What the fuck?
---
Yes, GW2 is a product and of course its only point is to make money for A.Net. And yes, games that sell power do it worse. But A.Net is still choosing to implement ideas that benefit them at the expense of the consumer and they are doing this so that they can improve their profits. The fuck would we cheer this?
---
&gt;scrapped the Nightmare Court and Malyck plots.
---

---
What the actual...they have Tom Holland ad with 11m views.
---
LOL mate, we're losing players already as it is
---
&gt; And one fewer slot is one slot more you might buy through bank/character/inv expansions
---
To be fair, my bank's *been* maxed for awhile, and these jackasses won't *let* me buy more space.
---
*sees that there are more downvotes than upvotes*
---
"Hunh. Were folks just hating or...."
---
*watches the trailer*
---
"WHAT. THE. ACTUAL. FU..."
---
Yep due to T4 Fractals, I'm actually thinking the Scarlet's Armies potion is the most useful of the three.
---
Gaming wise, ryzen wont be equal for few years in single core performance.
---
A few days ago I beat Zhaitan and W O W that was such a cool fight! I'm not going to lie, I'm usually not too big on game stories but seeing all the people I've helped throughout the game come together to beat him was awesome. I'm sad that the story's over, but now I'm itching to try a different profession. Mesmer looks really interesting (Chrono and Mirage even more, but the base profession too)!
---
&gt;Mounts are also pay walled right?
---
No, they are for free. They are just not included in the Demo Version of the game.
---
&gt;That's why you have people using their shiny cosplay builds and infusions unable to do anything but getting downed in T2s.
---
If you think explaining things will prevent that, you've never played with other humans before.
---
There's no connection between the two or am I missing something?
---
No I totally remember it. I also cited as the reason I wouldn't bother picking up the game. It wasn't until a few months after launch where some friends showed me their gameplay vids that I was willing to give it a shot. It was thankfully nothing like that trailer :V
---
I was so hyped hoping to play the MaCaw the second one in the picture lol. 
---
Still, as much of a dream now as it was when GW2 was announced. 
---
http://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/7/7f/C4_Tengu_concept_art.jpg
---
Ello, i love GW2 and i want to play it with my friend who can not afford to buy POF so key would be perfect gift for him, gl to everybody tho.
---
&gt;that's experience not elitism
---
&gt;​
---
&gt;it's like 2 ppl go to a job interview 1 with 20 years experience one just finished school
---
guess who get's the job if someone asked for an experienced worker.
---
Asking for high experience where you can take new players is elitism...
---
To take back your example, if McDonald only ask for ppl with a Ph.D. and 5+ years of experience to be cashier, it also is elitism, and that is exactly what is happening in raid right now for me...
---
There was recently a giveaway of PoF keys so it might have been from that. However if they were offering to pay for it then I think you did the right thing.
---
With the anniversary sale around the corner it should be getting a nice discount soon.
---
Looks really good 👌🏻
---
trilogy? there's only 2 xpacs... and as for $15.. be real careful you get the serial codes from authentic authorised 3rd party resellers or from anet themselves.
---
unsuspecting ppl have purchased the game from bad resellers and have gotten their accounts suspended.
---
Thank you!
---
Well yeah, the base game, hot and POF for $15? I'm gonna gift the extra game codes to a friend of mine who doesn't have it yet.
---
could just be a remnant of the original dragon bash
---
Hi, first of all I would like to thank you for what you are doing, this is another proof that the Guild Wars community is the best. I've been touring Tyria since the beginning of the brand's existence. A few weeks ago, I convinced my girlfriend to join me. It took her less than an hour to fall in love with this universe. Since then we have been traveling this world together and even I perceive everything differently. Unfortunately, life requires sacrifice and we can't afford to invest in games in the near future. So I don't want this key for myself, just for her, for her smile and pure joy in her eyes. 
---
P.S. At Coddler's Cove we spent over an hour watching small quaggans :) Maybe today I will show her a hidden room at the Desert Borderlands. I hope she will like it :D
---
I could be wrong, but it's most likely a bundle with HoT and PoF in a single key. The base game hasn't required a key for a long time.
---
correct as an example thus years draonbash holograohic pre weapons you can take that sigil and sell the sigil 
---
however Dungeon armor where the runes are typically account bound you wouldnt be able to sell
---
Well of course the availability of crack sounds good to a crack addict.
---
Trilogy...he probably meants GW1, that is different game, even though they are connected by lore, world, achievements, and such, the gameplay is different. It is worth getting if you are invested into the lore heavily, as it predates GW2 by 250-ish years, preparing the foundations for all the story we now are in, yet it is independent stories. But if you are saving money, be sure to get the correct game :P
---
Well, after exposure to 2 exploding elder dragons, a god and an immortal lich, my character has yet to go *too* batshit crazy, so I'd say it's a fairly solid piece of lore to carry around.
---
Even if it is just another piece of abandoned content, it's one I'm happy was added. Nicely explains away any effects of bloodstone madness on our character.
---
For now you can create a guild and put waypoint codes in the message of the day.  When you click represent there will be a clickable list in the chat. I do this for daily vistas and gathering nodes.
---
I can fight your argument against you. Since you can convert gems to gold you can literally just pay irl money for everything ingame and earn 0.
---
Actually one thing changed, you now can rent a mount even as F2P for 1silver for a hour and try it out, there is rental npc by each race track (brisban wildlands, gendarran fields, mount maelstrom, snowden drifts, kessex hills, diessa plateau) and within the festivals.
---
That's a big chicken.
---
The best strategy is to have both of them ready and swap them when needed/suitable. 
---
Getting ascended one should be quite easy, [calculator says it is just 42 gold if you had to buy everything](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/calculator/a~0!b~1!c~0!d~1-46761). But usually you should be able to have most of those materials from normal gameplay, and after all, half the cost is just a wood, that is easily farmable by just going around zones for a bit when exploring. Just don't ignore sapling but get them and you will be able to craft it in no time. 
---
The added value is that you can then use it even on other characters, it is permanent investment that won't get lost.
---
no connection at all, probably for the best lmao
---
The 3700x is literally within 5% of the 9900k on Single core performance in gaming.   
---
Here is a good sum up of actual performance. And is absolutely destroys the 9900k which will benefit anyone who does any production work next to gaming or streams, which isn't uncommon nowadays.  
---
Not to mention, software and BIOS updates will close the gap just like they have with previous generations on both CPU and GPU.   
---
You go ahead and drop $140 extra on a 9900k if you want. But don't talk nonsense.
---
Withing 5% and equal are 2 different things
---
your overall chance of getting an item increases with each try. if you open 1 mil boxes you have a higher chance of getting it than only 1 box.
---
Whenever you're practicing dps rotation on a new class, try to understand why the rotation is what it is in the first place. It usually comes down to damage modifiers, cooldowns and dps of the skills. On DH the most important damage modifiers are:
---
* 20% from Spear of Justice active
---
* 10% from having symbol active
---
* 10% and 250 Ferocity from having Retribution, normally covered by GS symbol and Chronos but can be lacking sometimes due to fight mechanics or bad Chrono so sometimes it's better to take Healer's Retribution trait and use Litany of Wrath to keep it up
---
* 10% from cripple which mostly is covered by Sword of Justice and Spear of Justice active
---
Regarding those, the biggest problem in your rotation is symbol usage. You want to have symbol active as much as you can and you might have noticed GS symbol has a long cooldown but scepter doesn't. That's why you always drop scepter symbol right before swapping to GS - so you don't have to use the GS symbol right away to get the damage bonus, instead you can wait for ~4-5 seconds before using it and only miss out on the damage bonus on a few autoattacks before being able to swap back to scepter.
---
You're sometimes using too many big damage skills without Spear of Justice active. You can start using them 1-2 seconds before Spear of Justice comes off cooldown but don't use them so that they do pretty much all their damage before you're able to get the Spear of Justice on the target. I know you can't have it for nearly everything but you can have it for more than you did. Also Sword of Justice is a really great skill to time for Spear of Justice due to the ammo system, you're not wasting any dps by not using it right as it gets 1 charge since it still keeps recharging. That's even a bigger issue if you're slower on the rotation than the SC guy, he can almost fit all 3 charges into one Spear of Justice but you couldn't.
---
People are commenting on your rotation being too slow, and I agree with that. Best way to improve that is just by playing more. At some point you'll notice you can do the rotation without thinking about it and with your eyes closed - at the same time you'll realize you're also doing the rotation faster. The time it takes to get to that point varies. After playing GW2 so long and with so many different dps specs and rotations - I can pretty much reach the benchmarks on any new class/rotation after 30-60 minutes of practicing but for a new dps player it's probably going to take a lot longer, maybe even 10 hours, but that also depends on how much you concentrate on it. You also won't really reach that point at all if you don't actively try to improve whenever you play and just slack instead.
---
I might expand this later but don't have more time right now. You can also ask me any questions, I've played DH for thousands of hours in hundreds of weekly raid clears and thousands of daily fractals by now.
---
Within 5% on launch day means it will catch up and most likely surpass Intel's 9900k within months.
---
Yo, was looking to get back to gw2 again and was roaming reddit to get the hype up and same this. Giving it a go! Had it since release but only purchased heart of thorns. Have a good day byee
---
I think that now they have finished season 4, they would do well to go back to some of the older content and give it all a makeover. The dailies in Tyria, for instance are not a lot of fun, given that the events there don't scale well when hit on by lots of high level characters. I feel that investing so much resource in (very long) personal story elements is a bit of a misdirection and has also lead to somewhat disjointed maps, much better if they now concentrate on adding new content into some of the existing maps and generally spruce the events and things up there. Hopefully they will have time for a bit of work on PVP too esp WvW - I find it hard to motivate myself to play these modes now.
---
Perfect, lots of helpful information in here regarding how blasting works, thank you very much!
---
What dows pvt even mean? Player versus..??
---
yes, it will never reach 100%.
---
I can’t imagine the lack of Focus breaking your build. Shield is great to use alongside Stalwart Speed (master trait) since the Shield 4 will easily give quickness to anyone who may have missed with your heal skill.
---
Alright, thank you! That's exactly what I needed to hear. :)
---
Yeah, I was not using stealth on any other time but when commander asked for it. Just the process of it was what I had questions about. Thanks eitherway! :)
---
Thanks for the answers! :)
---
Habs ausgefüllt, viel Erfolg bei der Masterarbeit :)
---
I mean, it makes *some* sense. Allies and close friends (our very first mentor figure and the person who made our political position of power solid) are captured and to be corrupted at any moment, and Elder Dragons are the most dangerous in the ~5 year span just after they wake up, which is at that very moment for Mordremoth, who spreads further and faster than any other Elder Dragon (as established by S2).
---
But on the other hand, other games do it while allowing plenty of detours (Mass Effect trilogy all being fine examples).
---
And on the third hand, they could have easily allowed us to rescue Logan and Zojja halfway through the game (say southern Auric Basin) thus allowing the second half to be slowed down and not a "race against the clock" type plot.
---
Holy shit , that's awesome. I have a personal guild ,and had no idea. Thanks!
---
Im looking to get my character 3D printed, how did you get the model?
---
I play GW2 for WvW. That’s is all.
---
Because you're a new player - for now don't worry about crafting. The main usage you'll have for it is ascended gear and some runes/sigils which are cheaper to craft if you have the material. Exotic gear, which you can usually buy on the tp, is good enough for most of the game including raids.      
---
Usually you'll buy the materials you need for crafting on the TP.  
---
Some recipes can make you a profit when done on a large scale(mostly crafting massive amounts, selling Legendaries or crafting time gated materials), but you should also worry about that later. Playing the game and doing meta events will net you a good amount of money. (The big meta events can net you 1g+ in rewards per event)  
---
Legendaries are a massive commitment(1.4k-2.4k gold+time), so think about them when you'll decide to go for one.  
---
Tl;dr - don't worry about it for now. Enjoy the game. In a few months return and read farming guides.
---
Everyone I know talked about Skyrim (if they ever), Monste Hunter, Warframe, etc. I'm the only one talk about GW2.
---
IF you ever change your mind , the elite specs , Reaper and Scourge , both play very differently from core necro and are both powerhouses. The caveat is that you have to hit 80 first then train them.
---
Alright, here is the STL file I used.

someone is going to open up this thread thinking they are just and righteous telling you you are better off logging back in and spamming map chat than making this thread, but i understand the frustration!
---
I can kinda see why you have the regret? The green of Eirs under shirt and the immediate background almost makes her arms and part of her shoulders disappear. Then the purple and you've found yourself setting to much of your peice in a single area of the color wheel. And your already sorta spread out "appropriately" in regards to the color wheel "rules" so it's hard to figure out which part of it to hit when feel up the background...Eir is the focus, yes? So I agree with you, as an artist, the background kinda muddies the focus away from her. In future, with these types of character focus prices if you feel the need to place a background, pick am underrepresented color and Another aspect; a ghostly blueish Garm behind her or perhaps a yellow firey bow and arrow? Or yellow/firey Garm......Meh a ghostly blue bow sorta strikes a Gaurdian note which isn't Eir-i love your work and agree with you about the background. It should be different to make Eir really pop

ranger isn't good in WvW zergs
---
This reminds me, of how much I dislike most of the tattoos that video games allow you to apply. Usually looks random as fuck
---
You are really trying to paint "see a random movie, pot luck" type of thing that you *do not have to buy if you don't want to* as "scummy"?
---
Its quite simple, you don't have to buy it. 
---
Stop this ridiculous "think of the children!" nonsense. People have been mocking this line of thinking for years and now some people have decided its suddenly a great argument. 
---
Stop this incessant painting of anything you remotely dislike as some evil, terrible thing. 
---
What's telling is that this always has to be twisted into this scenario of "getting the thing you actually want". You are already imposing one specific mindset on everybody in order to paint this as the worst thing possible. 
---
What if somebody likes the idea of seeing a random movie and being surprised with what they get? You seek to remove that choice because you personally don't like it by employing some faux concern for others and branding anything you dislike as some inherently evil, terrible thing. 
---
I would posit that simply not offering the choice of which movie to see would be just plain bad business and most of the time people wouldn't buy the product on offer. That doesn't mean "what shall we see tonight?" "dunno, shall we try the pot luck place?" to be an invalid mentality because *something something the one they want something something*.
---
You don't want your kids seeming some of those movies? Quite simple. Don't take them then. What's on offer is not for you. Similarly, don't give them unfettered access to your credit card in online games. Parenting. Great. Not my concern though. 
---
You don't have to buy it. But of course this is complaining about video games on Reddit and everything has to be painted in terms of people being a bunch of witless dupes with zero self control who are stupid, don't know any better, have no self control and are being psychologically manipulated by the evil men in suits and that will be used as ammunition to argue against anything said Redditor dislikes. 
---
I prefer to treat people with a modicum of respect and realise they don't want to be used by some anonymous, superior acting person on the internet going on a faux moral crusade for them because they dislike the way some of their toys are made.
---
So you're telling me that the market is going to sink if people who buy 40 dollar expansions geta set of basic berserker exotics for free? I could see that making sense if you couldnt already get a set of exotics for around 15g or how the ranges for pieces on the TP didnt go from 2 - 60G purely based on cosmetic appeal
---
good stuff, but is it me or are parts of the video slightly inspired by the avatar movie?
---
i too get triggered by going down the wrong hole... wait 🤔
---
Nice of you.

I got around to play core and HoT so far and still lots of stuff to explore.

---
Oh yeah definitely, exploits should be reported. I am just salty about how Anet never took action for those. 
---
Though I have to disagree with AM multimap not being an exploit. It was clearly unintended as why should a meta require people to swap maps repeatedly to yield intended reward?
---
I think you didn't really get the message even though you addressed it yourself.
---
First of, not every zerg is created equal. There are zergs that want to be optimal to fight at a higher level than just random zergs and it couldn't even be your build you got kicked from the zerg. Depending on the Commander you could have been forced to use a voicechat like teamspeak or Discord and when you don't use it you don't get in the Squad which might be the case for your initial experience and then not getting kicked because you joined an open, more relaxed squad.
---
However, even if, as you described it, that is the cause of why you got kicked from the squad not every build or playstyle is suited to be played in every scenario. Ranger is viable but not every playstyle or build is optimal for every situation. You should know this since I don't expect you to play a PvE Raid build in PvP as you said so yourself.
---
I really like your artstyle!
---
Biggest PvP streamer.
---
Hey, I remember this back at launch! My hobby back then was meeting up at night with some friends and walking on hot coals so the ad really spoke to me.
---
thats why u cc the pet idiot
---
Harrier's has more concentration than minstrels, and for raids you don't necessarily want to be the tank on every support build.
---
Why are You Typing like That?
---
The only believable part of those "leaks"
---
so, going with the newest glider from the black lions chests and gw2 efficiency, lets say each of those 2770 accounts got it within 10 trys (which is generous), thats 900 gems per account...so 2.493.000 gems. you are looking at 31.162 dollar.  
---
go further, the 2nd latest exclusive combo (Branded Relic Glider) is now at 8810 unlocks. nearly 100k $.  
---
hydra staff....18k unlocks...~202k$.  
---
now tell me again how this is not their main income when they activly push those exlusives out since years and not all people are not on gw2 efficiency PLUS you won't always get those exclusives within 10 trys.
---
It is impossible to meet the speed which hardcore players clear content, but the current split with ls seasons feels bad. Most ls4 maps are not interesting to stay outside of the currency farm, while people are still clearing ls3 fractals every day.
---
Caudicus did nothing wrong.
---
cant blame you, wait till you play the new expansion, the level of story telling sets a really high bar for other mmos. and their next alliance raid has tie in with nier:automata so i cannot wait what yoko taro will bring to the game
---
Sure. Tell me my CC skill.
---
The only use for ranger in organized squads is to kill your own teammates with other zerg reflect.
---
Better late than never.
---
I feel personally attacked.
---
I mean pinsniping is viable for zerging
---
It's really good! I wouldn't worry about the background but if it really bothers you, you can take a really careful top down picture and work on it digitally. Just a thought.
---
You can sometimes survive on ele too if you spam the 2 skill just as you hit the ground
---
fuck you OP
---
Even if you CC the pet it continues rezzing until it receives another command from ranger. The only solution is killing the pet, but that's impossible from downed state.
---
In all cases you get maxed concentration. More concentration on a certain piece of gear only means more power on another. It's not like a Harrier's player can get 275% boon duration and a Minstrel's one only 175%. They all stop at 100%. So what are you doing with your additional gear resources? Invest them into zerker's so you do 2,7k DPS instead of 1,9? Woohoo.
---
I can go Minstrel just as well, do 0,7% and never have to gear about getting one-shot by the mechanics. Simpler life.
---
Oh, nice too know. I probably don't play my ele enough to remember, but this is a good tip.
---
personally never had trouble with the pet in a rev ds duel, usually saves me enough time for a plus
---
Part of that made me thing: "underwater expansion confirmed?"
---
It gets *much* better. Like, by orders of magnitude. The core game's story is largely generic fantasy trash (and I say that as a Final Fantasy fanboy). It picks up at the start of Heavensward, and just keeps getting better.
---
The filler quests inbetween expacs (their equivilent of living story) is alright, but very fetch-quest-y.
---
It's worth sticking at it to get to the expacs, but the core game is a bit of a slog, I'll be honest. Much the same as core GW2 is now, I'd imagine.
---
Only in the sense that you need to buy the expansion. That is not what most GW2 players consider a pay wall.
---
I agree it is far better to take somebody with experience, I just would like people to be reasonable. Once again, I have no problem with group asking 50 to 150Li as it look reasonable. Neither I blame people asking for 250Li on Monday because they clean every boss in record time. However asking for 250Li for only escort, VG or Cairn is a nonsense...
---
And it is same for the real world example, asking for a cashier with some experience (1 year) is normal, when asking for a cashier with 5+ year is absurd ! If you need somebody with 5+ years of experience, it is a manager you need.
---
And finally, from my experience, I saw people with 10-30Lis playing FAR BETTER than ppls with 250... You know why ? Because ppls with 250Lis do not listen, they have their way which is "better" than yours. If you have unusual group (because everyone do not love to play meta), they do not adapt...
---
Of course all I said do not apply for very high level, but that would be a totally different subject which I was not speaking about right now.
---
How do you go from a Raiding topic to Fractals? 
---
I can see you dont have any braincells left but please some of us still want to keep theirs.
---
Plenty of WvW guilds already do this. It's not a "supported playstyle", but it exists.
---
&gt;Don't rush to end game like most people tend to want to do. It took me a good year to get through the base game because of how boring it was.
---
The counter-argument to this is that a year's subscription at the lowest entry level will set you back £92.28 on top of the cost of the game. I couldn't justify that just to reach the good part of a story. Instead, use the free trial for as long as possible, get every job to the trial level limit, then blaze through the whole base game on the 1 month you get free with the base game. Job done.
---
After that, coordinating with friends so we can all play together for a 1 month re-sub once or twice a year to catch up on all the new content at the same time is the way I go. Far more affordable with none of the costly downtime between patches.
---
Full ascended minstrel's gets you 42.2% boon duration. Full ascended harrier's gets you 64% boon duration. It's quite restrictive to get 100% boon duration with minstrel's on the classes it's even possible to do that on.
---
Edit: without food, runes, or sigils.
---
I figured out a quite faster way to get up there.
---
To the east there's a really, really tall tree without leaves which is close enough not to lose too much height after flying from it with the griffon.
---
You can get to the very top of the highest branch with skyscale, switch to griffon, fly west fast, pull all the way up, leap of faith to skyscale, and get almost right to the top of the invisible walls. Just a bit of bond of vigor and you are there.
---
Has been requested since release, nothing has changed. You are forced to play wvw if you want to fight guild vs guild and even then its a game of chances if your are going to meet similar sized guild. While everyone is free to join the fight.
---
The trick is that you can actually glide while in mistform. So when falling, just press 2 somewhere before impact c:
---
I know just the thing. 
---

---
They could put there a golden cat who wants something that takes a ton fulgurite  to get it. Like 2000. I don't know were to spend all these obsdian, and Hot ascended materials I'm getting all the time.
---
Maybe I should get into making jeweled damask patches.
---
Hey guys I have been playing gw1 for a long time with my friends and we had so much fun going through all the cool places like cantha or elona to explore all of them and go to the quest to kill abbadon or shiro.We had so much fun so we decided to continue playing gw2 all of my friends have bought  the game with the expansions and are already progressing in it but I have financial issues and can't afford buying any of the expansions I would be really grateful if I can get one key so I can play with my friends and have atleast one good thing in my life.
---
You know what caused one of the big catastrophes in Guild Wars? Guilds ... warring with each other. So it's kinda canonical to not have actual Guild Wars in Guild Wars 2 :)
---
Sylvari design aside I rather liked that trailer which I think did its job (showcasing the playable races).
---
It's interesting to be reminded that the racial cities got a massive redesign after those trailers. I like the two shots of the Black Citadel more than the final product... Looked more complete and functional. Hopefully if we ever go to the Blood Citadel or Ash legion's capital it'll look more like that...
---
I've heard some older phones will automatically capitalise every word.
---
This is so unbelievably not true, it's not funny. I understand you're a competitive guy but I'm in PvE areas all the time. I call for help when I need it, and I provide help when other people need it. Bandit bounties.  Group events. They're designed for people to cooperate. Cooperation doesn't have to equal organization.
---
Let's pretend someone in map chat asks for help with a bandit bounty. At the same time, while we're fighting it, a guild filled with people start coming and attacking another guild, even though I'm part of neither guild.  The event will scale up, causing it to become far more difficult, even though people aren't attacking him.  The ensuing chaos would be great for PvPers and terrible for people who spend most of their time in the open world, like I do.
---
As you get to more end game zones, that cooperation becomes more and more apparent. Meta event, bounties, guild bounties even, all stuff that people cooperate on, whether they organize or not.
---
So yeah, there's cooperation all the time in the open world. I rez people all the time and people have rezzed me. I've had people come way out of their way to rez me.  Once I fell in a jumping  puzzle and died. I could have waypointed but it would have meant starting the whole thing over. A helpful couple of people doing the same puzzle worked together to rez and port me back up, even though I didn't know them. 
---
Honestly the design of open world PvE in this game is cooperative, rather than competitive. I'm not competing for kills most of the time anyway, I'm getting more kills as more people show up, because there's more stuff to kill in events.  It's like we're playing two completely different games.
---
Rollerbeetle races are accessible by free to play. That's something to do

The individual chance to get it each time is the same, but your overall chance to get it after X tries is dependant on the value of X.

---
\+25% movement speed you can get from runes etc, and some classes even have +33% movement speed for a time.
---
For anything more, you need a mount, which are NOT paywalled. Expansion is not a pay wall.
---
Can get Raptor easy by simply doing the story, and you can get war mount by doing WvW and some quests in there related to mount.
---
&gt; Nothing ever changes anymore. No existing zones are modified, only new zones are created.
---
Uh no. Many current story events were added to Core Tyria maps, eg. running Ley-Line Anomalies, Inquest ley-line coalescences and bandit bounties of LS3, Awakened invasions and Mists Rifts of LS4. (Even beetle races can be regarded as recent story, as all mounts came after contact with Elona has been restored.) True that these just feel tacked-on to maps that portray completely different time periods, but still, they are recent additions.

What the f\*\*k does this have do to with Guild Wars 2?
---
I think the Hearts &amp; Minds instance was actually good if you went as 3 sylvari, it made the whole fight more personal. But yeah I'm sad about the cut out Nightmare Court storyline, and the awkwardly shortened end of the Dragon's Stand meta.
---
This is frustrating? Try the volcano one and then do it again
---
Because minstrel has toughness and that will probably make you tank some bosses in raids. If you want to tank that's ok but I don't recommend it for a new player.
---
You did a great job, especially with the blending of colors and the eyes.
---
No. It is bugged. Especially underwater.
---
If you CC the pet, it will just run back and keep trying to revive without waiting for the skill to be used again.
---
Underwater, you can even kill both pets and the second will keep at it. 
---
Rangers can even use the pet's F1-F4 skills while downed even though for all other professions their mechanics are disabled while downed.
---
They really need to fix that.
---
This. I have 500+ Globs of Dark Matter and I'm unlikely to use them for anything. Is there any way to turn them into gold?
---
Wvw and pvp are barely supported already. Gw2 was designed as pve game from start, unlike gw1 which was apparently more focused on pvp.
---
Why? Nobody really knows.
---
Classes don't use melee first, _people_ stay in melee range and use whatever weapon is best, _in endgame content_. The reason for this is that most buffs in the game are AoE, so sticking close together allows your supports to easily buff the entire group. "Defense" from armor is also not really a concept that applies to this game - most of the defenses in the game are active, i.e. dodging or blocking, not just taking hits to the face. Also, different armor weights don't actually have different stats, so heavy armor doesn't inherently make you "tankier".
---
Anything can be ran in a zerg.
---
But so happens it isn't meta, and people usually want the best for the best results.
---
Since Ranger takes up a slot in the zerg and doesn't provide the best result, it is natural that it is excluded. 
---
Same with Thief.
---
&gt; How do you feel about the lack of slutmogs for Asura in this game? Any comments? 
---
I'm fine with that, I however wouldn't mind some more proper asura feminine look for female model, instead of the usual male-copy or fucked-up-human-female-copy-onto-asura-with-bra-and-shit
---
&gt; Pizza with or without pineapple?
---
Fuck pineapple, although I like adding some mayo on top of the done pizza as some extra flavor, depending on its toppings, generally more meaty pizza tastes better with a little extra mayo added on top. Mayo not as a topping, but added after the whole pizza is done and cooked. Everyone I know mocks me for the Mayo and jokes a lot, but I genuinely find it tasty on some certain pizza types. Like a pizza with ham, sausage, bacon, cheese, mozzarella, corn, onions, mushrooms toppings tastes pretty well if you add just a tiny bit of mayo afterward on it, like flat half a teaspoon amount of it kind of smeared on top of a slice of regular sized pizza. It kinda acts like salt, brings out some flavors.
---
there's a slight difference between the armor weight's but the bulk they don't make up the bulk of your stats
---
Rezzing downed people is more than being a +1 in my book. There are plenty of smaller events around the world were people do look out for each other. They may not be on voice running a raid, but it doesn't mean they're not cooperating or even paying attention. Sure there are people who hit the 1 skill and do nothing else. There are others who buff heal and rez...yep,. even in the open world. I'm one of them.
---
And take portals in mistform.
---
Oh I fully agree, don't get me wrong. I did my research and have my armor and all the achievments and LD for coalescence.
---
The problem is that the game in genral expects nothing from you and some ppl follow that route while trying to raid and that won't work. 
---
And I think Anet could have done better to reduce this problem ingame-design whise than they did.
---
Instead they've chosen to implement raids just like that for the more serious playerbase and literally excluding everyone else. And now the "toxic" raiders get flamed, but Anet did framework this problem, not the players. Anet literally designed it to have a huge cap between the raiding and the open world playerbase. Which is a design choice you can make, but Anet is more to blame than the so called elitists. 
---
They usually don't really care what build you play as long as you do your dps and dont fuck up mechanics, and I speak from 300+li/ld purely pugging on condi weaver perspective over the last 2 years...
---
Necromancer Axe isn't melee.
---
Elementalist Dagger isn't exactly melee, but it is close enough.
---
Mesmer GS isn't Melee.
---
Revenant Hammer isn't Melee. 
---
Just because it is a Melee weapon doesn't mean it is used to actually smack things in Melee range.
---
First time I watch this trailer. Good thing I didn't, 'cos if my interest for GW2 depended of this video, I'd not be playing it... or I'd still be wondering if they're offering a game experience or a movie.
---
yes you can, it just takes ages...
---
Now your turn, answer me. Before you do, type “pay to win definition” into google.
---
GW2 has a more fluid profession system in which the Armour type is not the defining factor for your profession but rather how you want to play with it and what build you are using. A Mesmer, as light armour wearer, is a tank in Raids.
---
The same applies to Weapons, not every weapon that is used at a certain range in other MMOs are actually not in that range in GW2 but that also depends on the profession. So, for example, Axe on Warrior is a melee weapon while Axe on a Necro is more of a mid range weapon. Also, not every weapon does the same. A scepter on a necro is more of a condition damage weapon while an axe or a greatsword is more of a direct damage weapon.
---
The reason why players say to stay in melee range is because of a few things.
---
On the one hand, if you stand close together you are more likely to get Boons, effects and Combos from other players in your group/around you. Depending on the number of players around you, in zergs against a world boss for example, you could even be more unlikely to get hit by attacks.
---
It also makes players more accessible to other players when they go down. You would only need to press F to revive them instead of running out of the fight, rubbing you back to health and going into the fight again.
---
Also, not many Skills actually have an impact on your damage depending on your range to the enemy. So you can cast your AoEs from an Elementalist Staff (which is a ranged weapon) just as good standing next to them as when you stand at full range, though as I said above you will not get the boons and lose damage. Of the top of my head there is the skill of the longbow on a ranger, Rapid fire, that actually does more damage the further away your target is.
---
So, in conclusion, players don't use those things to match their profession type but either what is the best option for that build through more damage, better versatility through boons or CC.
---
&gt; How do you use active defense when you either need a shield equipped or use certain skills on certain weapons which are not for blocking only but from what i have seen are either block or attack skill (no idea on how to use those tbh) and have a long cooldown once used
---
Most of the time your active defenses are not your weapon skills, but your slot skills. They also come in different varieties - for example, a skill that recharges your dodge is an active defense skill if you think about it that way.
---
&gt; you can do 2 dodges and thats it untill its cooldown ends
---
Yes, that's very intentional - dodging gives you a lot of evade frames, so making it too common would make it trivial to avoid most attacks.
---
&gt; I have tried to join in on some big boss fights and if i go in close, i get obliterated in a matter of seconds
---
Do you mean the big world boss fights? Can you describe the boss? Is it the Shadow Behemoth, a big shadowy thing?
---
&gt; even with a tanky melee class cause I can not survive even a few seconds when I get into melee range
---
Warrior is very much _not_ a tanky melee class, at least without a specialized build. Your base health pool is the same as that of a thief.
---
Unfortunately I'm the kind of idiot who'd come into the puzzle and go through it just to rez you. This is why people keep revive orbs on them.
---
R.I.P. :(

But doesn't tanky stats on gear detract from damage output potential? Every guide ive read so far says to prioritize damage stats (power/precision/ferocity?) over any other stats.
---
So if I try to put on more tanky stats on gear to not be downed in 1 hit, then I will hit like a wet noodle which will take ages to kill anything?

&gt;A Ranger is an archetype found in works of fantasy fiction and role-playing games.
---
&gt;Rangers are usually associated with the wisdom of nature. Rangers tend to be wise, hardy, cunning, and perceptive in addition to being skilled woodsmen. Many are skilled in woodcraft, stealth, wilderness survival, beast-mastery, herbalism, tracking, and sometimes "nature magic" or have a resistance to magic.
---
It has nothing to do with range.
---
Aragorn fought with a sword, John Snow fought with a sword, Drizzt fought with 2 sabres...

Stop stop they’re already dead

Does anybody remember what it is like to play other mmo's? Having to grind ur way up to max level by doing boring crap, following ! everywhere in a set path? This game makes it very hard to grind on the journey to max level, and also is just a joy to explore. It seems to me that this clip is expressing that journey. The grind comes after when u want to make ur shiny stuff. The only way to make it a grind is if u want it to be. There's plenty of other stuff in here other games don't have.
---
They do, and you don't normally get downed in 1 hit, even by big bosses.
---
it doesn't matter. the gems in the gold -&gt; gems are already paid by others.
---
However it might seem, and whatever it might be in other games, the name 'Ranger' isn't a reference to 'Ranged Combat'.  It's a reference to Lord of the Rings, where Aragorn was a Ranger, someone who patrolled the range and kept the Shire safe.  When you look at the Lord of the Rings movies, you don't see Aragorn as someone who kept his distance and avoided melee, do you?  While ranged combat is an option for a Ranger, it doesn't have to be what they're strongest at.
---
As for why melee tends to be better than ranged damage, it's a risk vs. reward setup.  If you're a long ways away from your enemy in most fights, you're safer.  If you can be safer and still deal a lot of damage, then that would be the preferred method of fighting and everyone would do it.  That's bad risk vs. reward.  GW2 does make some enemies that hate on ranged attackers in various ways, whether by attacks that ignore nearby does (Mordrem Thrashers, Forged Forerunners) or projectile reflects (Earth Elementals).
---
With all of that said... you're F2P right now, so none of this should matter to you.  In the open world, you can play whatever you want and be fine.  The recommended builds you'll find on websites are geared towards high-end content, higher level fractals and raids, things that are beyond your reach as F2P (or require an incredible effort just to get to, as fractals would).  So don't worry about it.  No one in the open world is going to criticize you for fighting at range.  People might criticize you for being a Ranger who uses Point Blank Shot to knock back an opponent that they're meleeing, because that's annoying, but someone fighting in melee and using a melee knockback would get the same reaction.  So just find a class that you enjoy and play it the way you want, without worrying about what websites say.  If you decide to buy the expansions and eventually look to get into raids or other high-end content, then you can change things up at that point, but there's plenty to do in the game beyond that, and many players will never even touch raids.

Warrior has more base health than thief. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Health

Yes, world bosses, but also group event bosses, champions and even veteran enemies. I also noticed that when an enemy is using some kind of buring effect aoe attack, even when I manage to kill them and move out of the aoe, I still die cause of the buring effect wont stop long after the fight is over. This is frustrating :(
---
I have achieved this once before too. Unfortunately, other times I hit some kind of obstacle, so I don't get enough air time to be revived.

If you look at the price history, before the festival they had risen to 12s with zero faucets.  With the recipe anet added with the festival, they will now be available relative to the crafting cost like most other consumables in the game.
---
Gandalf also used a sword, and Legolas fought in close combat as well. Gimli would be your archetypical tank class, I suppose.
---
Many, many people think of longbow as one of the typical Ranger weapons, like Legolas.  That is an archetype that has been repeated in many fantasy settings and it's disingenuous to ignore that.
---
Your question was about EA games if i understand correctly, so yeah, takes ages. So now you’re acting dumb, don’t. I reread what you said, you definitely ment EA and I gave you my answer (yes you can grind ingame in EA games and be able to eventually afford the loot boxes just by ingame means). Now please, have some decency and answer my question(s): considering what I said- exchange real world wealth for in game wealth (gems to gold conversion) is pay to win. Do you agree? Did you google “pay to win definition”?
---
And why tf would do do Macros for a Benchmark when you cant even do the Rotation properly on an actuall Boss? :)

Btw try to take a peek at the Rotation log. You see BUNCH of canceled Autoattacks in there, explain this o:

They started out well, then it went mostly downhill. They gave up on a lot of things from the manifesto.

That mail do not work anymore for some reason. You get a response saying something about you not having the permitions to use that mail. No clue why i used that mail many times before when there is video evidence or the like that needed to be added in the past.
---
True, true. A friend with an older PC had mentioned that as well. I think, as long as it doesn't require a huge rework of the engine, that they could add more levels to the character textures drop-down box. 
---
Older textures could remain at the top, under a new name set like "original textures" or some such, and the ones at the bottom could be "HD textures,"  that replace the "high-resolution character models" checkbox in the settings.
---
And you're 100% right about the art style thing. It's why the game has aged as well as it has. I think they could do it without ruining the aesthetic though, provided they had the time/ funds.

Well, at least something exists that makes Zhaitan look badass

"I've been thinking this over for a long time: how about *a bunch of people walking on hot coals*. Walking on hot coals is all the rage right now."

Lord of the Rings didn't have classes, because you know, it's not a game, it's a book. The idea that someone can only do one thing is limited to games, and that's due to balance reasons. 
---
Gandalf was clearly a wizard or elementalist but he too used a sword called glamdring.  The limitations of games don't apply to fiction nor should they. In fact, fiction is weakened when people resort to using tropes constantly. It never progresses that way.
---
Legolas was an elven archer. Aragorn was a ranger from the North. It's not his class, but more of his profession, as in more of what he did for a living. Guiding people through the wilderness, much like a park ranger might today.

Not really daily if its posted every once in a year by someone trying to be witty.

I hear that again and again. I started some months before pof released with 0 raid exp. I started with 1 li/week, than two, slowly climbing up one boss at a time until i got my leg armor. Is it effortlessly easy? No! Is it impossible? Far from, i have two kids, a wife and a job and never had a static and did this and i was late to the party. Ppl back then wanted 100+ li too, so it might be harder now but there are also more accessible encounters to start with. If you think you get your armor in 8weeks from zero without a static than maybe rethink. If youre okay with 1y work then it's doable.
---
Watch the red circle if it's an AE, move out of it then move back in once it goes off. And there's traits and skills which do condition cleanse so equip those if you find you're getting DoT-ed down alot.
---
First of all, thanks for this giveaway! I currently playing the core one, pre-ordered the game but somehow never started to play... but currently playing since 3 months and I'm having a blast. It's such awesome game and it really align with my play style (just running around and exploring everything).
---
They should all have something like Mistform. It doesn't make you heal faster, it doesn't do damage, but it will get you of the AoE area you died in and make it easier to get back to your group.
---
Are you on EU or NA?

If you are on NA, I will do the JP with my mesmer and help you though it.  When this is the daily JP i put up my comm tag and help ppl through it a couple times and then port a few at the end.

Its edited on my post: Xenri The Honorable im from eu tho

I have 2 friends and 1 brother that would like to try gw2. Anyway cheers for the giveaway!
---
Yeah, but who uses them?  I can pug T4 dailys/recs and be done inside of 45mins.  Sure Mai Trin is more challenging than some, but Aetherblade is a snoozefest.
---
If Potions could be used in raids, where min/max is the thing, then these adding these recipes makes more sense.  But why would I ever spend 5 Jorbreakers for a consumable used in already easy content?
---
And those who don't find fractals easy yet, are unlikely to go to great lengths to max out on stats via consumables.
---
/confused
---
Awesome! I'll follow this little guide! I remember I ddid son, quiver years ago. Since I'm returning I totally forgot about it. I fixed your comment so I can return to itm a great thing to remember! 
---
Never finished LWS3. It's time to do it! Thanks!
---
I think its still pretty accurate.
---
I don't know about mist form actually, it's one of the most OP and annoying ones, but on the other hand you definitely have a point with getting out of AoE. Maybe we should be able to crawl in the downed form? 
---
ANet  should close the gap between horrible and OP downed skills - Ele, Mesmer and Thief let you avoid stomping with no counter (unless somebody else times Reveal perfectly for mesmer or has a teleport for thief), while for Engi, Guardian, Warrior, Rev, Ranger and Necro all you need is single stability or stuff like blind. I think Engi has the worst downed skills (at least make the explosion unblockable...).
---
I understand this is a very complicated topic so I won't try to dive into details.
---
GW2 efficiency says I'm about 250g away from it.  Only question is do I wait for loyalty chest / reward tracks for missing clovers, buy them from fractal vendor, or take my chances in the magic toilet?

Regardless, AB multimap was an exploit and the players who engaged in this exploit knew full well what they were doing. Anyone telling that they didn't know this was unintended or still claim they weren't exploiting this unintended 'feature' would be lying or willfully ignorant. This is because at the time:
---
- Almost all of the PvE content yielded its maximum potential rewards in the same map instance. People did not swap maps after killing Vinewrath, Gerent, Mouth of Mordremoth etc. to loot the boss chests again. Boss chests rewarded the players who participated in the meta in that map instance only. 
---
- Similarly, all regular events in the game reward players that participated in the event. No exceptions.
---
- AB meta had a participation system. Switching to a map where you have no participation should not reward you. People didn't even need to participate in the meta at all and they could still multimap to get almost all of the rewards (the rewards from the popup chests after meta were just sad).
---
- Octovine does not have a single boss chest like many other metas, but instead spawn multiple node-like chests the players can open. This was similar to the map specific chests in other HoT maps (Airship Cargo, Noxious Pod etc.), however, all of those maps still had a main boss chest which gave the bulk of the loot (which players looted once) and other chests were side loot.
---
- The map specific chests in other HoT maps could be multimapped, however, they were nowhere near as lucrative as the Grand chests in AB. They did not spit out guaranteed rares and other valuable items.
---
- To open map specific chests in HoT maps players needed map specific keys. To not run out of keys players needed to do events to get keys directly or the currency they could use to buy the keys. However, if a player started with a small amount of keys, they would get enough currency from AB multimapping that they would never need to do other events to maintain a steady supply of keys. So the chests after AB were essentially made free to open, unlike other HoT maps.

Habe mich beteiligt und am Ende ein Problem festgestellt:
---
Bei der Geschlechtsangabe ist keine Option für nicht-binäre Menschen gegeben, es besteht lediglich die Möglichkeit, gar keine Angabe zu machen. Da gerade diese Leute aber nach eigener Erfahrung mit einer erhöhten Wahrscheinlichkeit Fantasy Games spielen, könnten dir da einige Messdaten verloren gehen. Es würde sich eventuell ein selbst ausfüllbares Kästchen anbieten.
---
Generell führt das bisherige Muster zu dem Problem, dass eventuell ein Geschlecht eher dazu geneigt ist, keine Angaben zu machen, wodurch das Ergebnis verfälscht wird.

And this is why drop rates are so stupidly low for anything people actually want. This is why normal people will never actually get a drop. Because there are people who can spend their lives farming stuff like this. I don't mean to be a dick or anything, but seriously? Why doesn't ANet just put a 10-cheat-a-day cap on this and make the drop rate something reasonable like 2%? No, they have to make it stupidly low to avoid people farming the hell out of stuff like this, which pushes those items dropping out of reach for normal people. SMH
---
&gt; the first impression was really, really bad for most players
---
Because these players either wanted a WoW clone or an updated GW1, they didn’t have their expectations at the right place. GW2 was always meant to be its own thing and every MMO always change, evolve and improve over time. That players were unrealistic or didn’t look back isn’t entirely GW2’s fault.
---
No stat combo reaches 100% boon duration with gear alone. No idea why you would remove food, runes and sigils from the equation.
---
How many of the people in the video are still working at ArenaNet?
---
So switch a few pieces from Minstrel to Harrier.
---
I’m actually highly against this. The games performance is lacking as is and you want to make it worse? That’s a really selfish request.
---
&gt; That's because GW2's combat style isn't as static as other games like WoW or Age of Conan in which moving cancels most of your skills and actions. In GW2 you not only can move while using most skills, you should be moving all the time.
---
Warrior, using greatsword, the most used damage skill locks you in the animation till the whole attack is done, its also afaik the skill that does most damage, and if i move even a little while this skill is casting, then the skill is canceled, no damage done but I still have to wait for its cooldown to end in order to use it again. I know about circle strafing a target but most of the hard hitting skills cancel out if you move. So far ive leared that about the most useful GS and Longbow skills, it doesn't help that the Longbow one has the longest coolodown aswell, so start casting it, the boss/enemy goes for a big hit, you naturally move out of the way, and no damage done and skill goes on long cooldown :( and you are left auto-attacking doing next to no damage
---
firstly, gw2 combat is mostly risk vs reward. melee skills will mostly hit harder then their ranged counterparts. that doesn't mean you do not have burst skills on ranged weapons...and that also doesn't mean you have to stay on range with a ranged weapon. for example there are many "fanning" skills which deal more damage in close range since you hit with more projectiles.  
---
secondy, active combat. nearly all skills can be cast while running and some skills even let you evade by using them (warrior greatsword 3, 3rd greatsword auto attackchain on ranger) or displace you in some kind of manner so you are out of the danger zone (leap skills which go backwards forc example)...or also let you go back in (gapcloser, also leap skills, just forward).  
---
standing on one spot facetanking everything kills you. the combat is so that you do not stare at some castbar from the enemy, you SEE that he starts channeling some hard hitting spell...sometimes even with ground indicators. you just need to move out of that area...called kiting. many attacks can simply be evades by running arround (or through) the enemy or by kiting / sitestepping.  
---
that means saving dodges for attacks you need to dodge because you reacted to late. you can also anticipate attacks and block them with certain active defenses. blocks are a thing (and counter attacks afterwards). or stuff like projectile hate...where you reflect or destroy projectiles and therefore do not need to dodge anything.  
---
most attacks also have big animations and even sounds tied to them so you take notice, its just a matter of learning the attacks and learning how to counter it. some have up to 3 seconds windup time so you can just run out, some are faster and need to be dodged...or anticipated so you are already out of range once the animation starts.  
---
third: CC...crowd control skills. blind is a big one...everything that is blinded will miss the next attack if its below champion level. some classes have fields which are there for 8 seconds or longer...in that time 5 targets basically can't do anything.  
---
but there is also hard cc. something that is stunned won't attack you, so you can channel your hard hitting attack without problems.  
---
getting a group of mobs together to hard cc em to the ground and then use some hard hitting aoe attack is how you cleave down everything in the normal open world.  
---
there is a shitton of different cc's in the game, you just need to utilize it right.  
---
forth there are utilities. some let you tank while you attack, some make so you won't get cc'ed or take status effects from you. also those which make your attacks way stronger are often used. you change them depending on what you do or which one you need for the encounter you have.  
---
the thing about gw2 is, forget about all the combat of other mmo's. its more action combat oriented like diablo or something like that.  
---
in the openworld, no one will care about what you do and you can experiement as much as you want.  
---
what you heard in terms of "melee is better" are, as others wrote already, most endgame teamcomps which share buffs and heals to get something done, and since those buffs / heals usually have a range of like 300 - 600, its better to just stick together. then its also easier to use hard hitting weapons.  
---
you just have to care to not fuck yourself when choosing traits, weapons and utilities. just because your weapon does 10 bleeding stacks, doesn't make it strong if you have power oriented gear.  
---
going hybrid is also mostly shit. you focus on one or the other...being new sticking to power weapons and gear ("berserker" / "assassins") is not wrong.  
---
you just have to identify what makes you strong (how to get fury / might in combat) and how to react to enemies (do i cc and burst or kite and wittle him down slowly or maybe both).  
---
while in group content, you do mostly stack and also get healed, so you do not need to dodge anything, there are quite a few really awesome soloes out there, where you can see how it actually is when playing solo.  
---
one great example is [sesshi soloing MAMA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta4WMiRKUho) from fractals level 99 in challenge mode, without getting any damage.  
---
this is basically "how its played" in solo situations. if you can't melee at a time, just don't.
---
Why? It would be a complete waste of money/gems.
---
Then walk. You can either lose a bit of silver or a bit of time. Pick your poison.
---
As a Mesmer, I have reverse-Mistform. It consistently gets me deeper into shit instead of out of it. Oh hey, a 270° radius of not-fire? You bet your arse it teleports you into that 90° that are on fucking fire.
---
&gt; "Its viable it just doesn't do jack shit compared to any actually viable class"
---
that's a hilariously terrible and inaccurate interpretation of what i said, but suit yourself.
---
ofc you need to draw the line somewhere, but frankly, with the state that wvw is in (thank you anet and toxic plebs), everything that doesn't immediately die *and* can use a skill or two is likely an enhancement to your team; assuming you are not playing against one of the remaining guild groups at least.
---
for the sake of their group and team, rangers should still reroll. however they are by no means as much of a burden as they were e.g. in the good old GWEN times.
---
It also works against all krait, not just toxic ones.
---
The only thing that is not really true anymore is the branching personal storyline which they replaced with the common commander arc to be able to tell a story of higher quality, which was the right decision anyways.. everything else is pretty much still true.
---
Rarely see people actually LFG for RP, let alone ERP XD
---
Textures have pretty high resolution in recent maps, strangely. But yeah, player characters fall behind
---
I've been playing gw2 for a couple of years now. In the early days quite some friends were by my side, most of them left though.
---
My brother is still playing, however, he only has Hot, so POF would be a nice addition.
---
Just shut up and buy those new Skyscale skins.  P.S. have you done your Dragon Bash dailies?  - Cheers Anet.
---
Seriously though, a GvG battleground that was 20vs20 or 15vs15 with public guild leaderboards would not be that hard to implement and would be very popular I'm sure.  Or even something like Tera's civil unrest.  The real problem is not ideas, it's lack of will.  Casual pve players buying gemstore skins are their target market, not GvG players.
---
TFW a ['fan' trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOYP4ViTYzU) does a better job of selling your new game.
---
Hi i did the benchmark from the guardian.I am Asian
---
Asian &gt; Macro
---
Best game to bond with friends over, no toxicity in the community (besides PvP lol)
---
Pay to win how? You do realize that outfits do not give damage or survival bonuses?
---
The thing of value in my proposal would be the discounted gems, something that they already offer but from what I know only when they sell deluxe expansions.
---
I am not sure, now that you mention it. But. Will more content added into the game earn more money? It's probably the way it works for Anet though, don't fix it if it's not broken.
---
to counter your argument: Anet released somewhat of class reworks or elite spec reworks. For example berserker got fairly big changes, not just "some cooldowns".
---
Going for world completion again would be a bit easier with a mount, as my mesmer isn't very fast on their own.
---
You blame toxic plebs but the vast majority have left the game. They're a strict minority. How is it their fault?
---
Back in pre HOT days we had far more "toxic" players, as well as diversity and leads to maintain a platform for different playstyles. Toxic rangers &amp; anet bullied them out of the game. 
---
Rangers and others provoke toxicity by refusing to listen to anyone or anything, despite insisting they're somehow team players, then cry foul when groups adapt to this behavior. Unfortunate!
---
Didn't even know we had a trailer XD Been playing since launch tho
---
You still force your tank to take some toughness though. This can be a problem, particularly in pugs, because you don't know how high the tank's toughness can be. You could argue that, as some dps builds have toughness, the tank should be able to have at least 1400 toughness or something. The truth is that some don't or just don't want to if they're not expected to.
---
I get your point, it's safer to run minstrel than harrier and I agree with that but in pugs you should just run with the lowest toughness possible because otherwise it could create problems. If you play in a static or a friend is tanking and you can agree on the toughness then sure, go minstrel.
---
If you did get downed in 1 hit, it means a mistake was made somewhere. Failed dodge, failed cc, failed mechanic, etc.
---
Excuse me if I get into the speech, but pay to win are that kind of games where if you use real money to buy stuff in game you have a great advantage over other player. Guild wars 2 isn't the case cause there is nothing in shop that give you a real adavantage over other players, just cosmetics or some utilities that you can't consider a real advantage.
---
Pretend this is an entirely new series and never ever compare it to Guild Wars 1 and you should be fine. Lots of GW1 simply can’t deal with how completely different GW2 is for better or worse.
---
We're not questioning the decision to rescue captured people, we're questioning the decision to have them captured.

In meiner Arbeit liegt der Fokus auf der Textlokalisierung also nicht auf audiovisueller Übersetzung, denn beides zusammen wäre leider zu umfangreich für die Masterarbeit geworden!

WvW for life.
---
&gt; SPVP and WvW on the other hand I know nothing about and feel a bit uncomfortable playing now because I'm so far behind in tactics and low level I feel like I can't keep up.
---
There is no reason to be afraid to join those game modes, or any game mode for that matter.
---
If you want to try WvW look a bit at builds online, since they can be very different than PvE builds and you might need to get some more defensive gear.
---
I would suggest a support build for starters mostly because you can stay alive more easily. This is great because if you don't die then enemies won't rally because of you and you can focus more on learning rather than starring at your dead body. Also you have a lot to contribute to the group and even if you are terrible as a beginner it will still be better than having no supprt at all.
---
If you join a commander ask if they use voice chat and log in so you can listen, even if you don't understand some terms etc. Don't be afraid to tell them that you are new and that you want to learn. Some will not like it but others will be very welcoming.
---
_________
---
If you want to try sPvP you should again look at builds online. Due to the matchmaking algorithm you will eventually be matched with players of similar skill so being a beginner won't matter much.
---
Just ignore any non-helpful chat and keep playing.
---
You will eventually encounter someone who will say something like "you have X achievement points and you suck at PvP. Go back to PvE scrub!". When that happens remember that the person telling that is matched with you because he/she is more or less as bad as you and thus their words don't matter at all.
---
_______
---
If you need any more specific advice for either game mode feel free to ask. I am no expert, but I will do my best to help.
---
Hope to see you in WvW and PvP soon!
---
Game looks really good for me. Sure, there are some clipping issues but is not the end of the world. Better performance would be awesome though, specially with higher-end systems.
---
Suspiciously specific, but I get you. XD 
---
Optimization is definitely a priority. The game is still great looking in many ways. But having the higher poly textures as an option if your system can handle it would be a nice edition imo.
---
With the exception of the beetle races, I think all of those are spawns.
---
Ignore the people arguing the semantics of "ranger" within the context of GW2. Just know that in GW2, Ranger doesn't quite align with the traditional ranger archetype found in other media.
---
A bad end can ruin and entire journey, but a good one can make it all worth it.
---
&gt; Toxic rangers &amp; anet bullied them out of the game.
---
*points at all the "wvw players can't make up their mind" and "look, wvw is getting a brand new (unbalanced) mount, it's getting enough attention from ANet, so shut up WvWers"-sayers that - minority or not - have a strong negative impact on WvW's reputation*
---
occasionally you make some great points about wvw, alas today does not seem to be such a day judging by the ways you attempt to argue, so i'll leave you to it. hf.
---
I think I've seen one of your drawings of eir in a different subreddit ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Don't care, not here for top notch graphism.
---
So what I think, is that I don't need/want dev time spent on it.
---
Then it wouldn't really be 1 hit down if it does 90%. And I can't think of any unavoidable damage that does 90%, off the top of my head.
---
Wasn't this song made for her voice?
---
if you must play healer then do it on rene, its better. firebrand support is best used as zerk.

and focus is important for your dps

What's "pinsniping"?

There is only one way of playing the game: Become a master. Get everything.

You can also log out in mist form and you’ll relog with full health. It’s useful if you’re in some remote area and find yourself overwhelmed and don’t wanna run back
---
I'm surprised Anet didn't make the value fluctuate with the economy
---
Me and my best friend start playing 3 months ago and reached lvl 80, but he was discouraged for not having the mounts and other contents of the expansion. I bought the expansion and tried to convince him to return to play with me, but he does not have the money to buy for himself. If I had a key it would be a great gift and incentive to go back to play gw2 . Obs.:  I'm from Brazil, and my English is rusty.
---
&gt; The only way to make it a grind is if u want it to be 
---
That's it.
---
One thing i would really like, would be difficulty servers where you can play the core game in a more difficult setting, because i really love that journey from 1-80 and the map completion and the events and the world bosses etc, etc. But it has, as expected, gotten really easy.
---
The stuff you mentioned aren't locked behind paywalls. You can earn some gems within the achievement points or you can convert gold to gems. I bought like 3 characters slot, 2 bank expanions, a couple of shared inventory, a glider and the molten pick all in this way and I can say I'm a casual player because i play like 2 hours a day not every day. I played some games where even if you grind 24/7 you are like shit compared to someone that spent real money, guild wars 2 ins't that tipe of game.
---
You can GvG in Armistice bastion, there is arena that let's you turn pvp on, with 3 possible teams. Arena itself is quite small, but you can actually fight all around the bastion (there are barriers that don't let you inside the bastion itself if you are in pvp mode).
---
It has WvW ruleset and you can join instances as you want (so not bound to servers as in real WvW maps). So all in all, this map was designed with GvG in mind. Maybe just as a precursor for some serious one, and to let people test the idea...
---
The only problem is that it costs gems to have it and thus nobody considers trying it out, thus Anet will see in their statistics zero usage of the feature and tinfoil hat me would say that it will lead into *"BuT AcTuaLly ThErE aRe No GvGs EvEn iF wE gAvE aReNa fOr It So We aBanDoN gVg alLtoGethEr"*
---
Dead? Oh sheit, than I have invested a couple hundreds of gold over the last two weeks in something that doesn't exists? RIP old friend. Was nice to meet you. But at least it has died to a dragon. Last time I was there I saw one.
---
Add Armistice bastion into that list.
---
Lol ymmd
---
Didn't GW2 launch in 2012? Why was that the most 90s thing I've ever seen? lol
---
Haha, ranger pet revive is awesome! I once really screwed up Slothasor by dying to floor while taking poison to the edge but managed to get back into fight.
---
I do feel like it would be a nice idea, but I have to share a few concerns.
---
Disclaimer: by any means I'm not a game developer!
---
- WvW. More complex models would load it even more heavily, there is already a lot of skill lag and overall lag going on
---
- The game itself is quite poorly optimised, at least for low-end pcs. I have quite heavy FPS drops, and most of my games run smoothly.
---
I guess they'd have to rework the engine / optimization, but it's not gonna happen lol
---
I think they are fine.
---
I also think that your current title is really poor: it does in no way describe the topic such that a reader can just by the title alone decide about whether the content is interesting or not. "Suggestion: improve older textures" would be an example for a much better title. Just imagine everyone using titles like "My opinion" or "The following would be really cool" or "What do you think?"
---
Gerent fails on many maps even daily, and usually it is because the pre-events are not done (looking at you, nuhoch line). it is due to lack of cooperation as people did not properly evened out their numbers per lanes.
---
During the bonus week, the issue was that many maps were just overflow instances when people usually came too late to actually coordinate the lanes, so it is not surprising at all.
---
Ausgefüllt und im Gilden-Discord geteilt!
---
it has been confirmed by devs. on reddit. years ago. reading the wiki article would have brought you to the source.  
---
it was never a secret that gems do not get generated from the game and they have a supply that can run out. the only ones supplying that pool is the players buying gems and putting them in.  
---
since you didn't do any research on yourself, [here you go](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/2xtjc7/psa_how_gems_work/cp3gd2a/).
---
Better than anything I could draw.
---
About 35-40% which is honestly far better than you'd expect for a 6 year old MMO. 
---
Sadly, some of the stuff in that other 60% is stiff that _really_ pissed of a lot of players though.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/2xtjc7/psa_how_gems_work/cp3gd2a/  
---
confirmed by devs years ago. its a pool with supply in it which is balanced by players buying gems and putting them into that pool, same as the goldpool is balanced by players by getting gems and putting gold into it.
---
Neat!
---
I can understand that having your commander be immediately sniped can be frustrating, but shouldn't the commander be taking steps to avoid exposing themselves, instead of relying on the enemy players to be "gentlemanly"?
---
" those gems in the pool do not get generated out of air, they are generated by players buying gems and filling them in. "
---
That is not how it works in gw2. Sure the prices go up the more ppl are buying and the more ppl are selling the prices of exchanges will go down but there is no buying first before someone can exchange gold into gems. There is no gempool than can be drained. Never was because players are not trading the gems directely. Noone has the exact statistics how much transactions are made per day but you can generate gems out of thin air. Only that the air will be more expensive every single time.
---
I would prefer them to first optimise the game and then revamp some bits :)
---
yes, there is some kind of fluctuation...i mean keys can even drop. i've got like 5 since release or so.  
---
but being lucky is the minority and activly farming keys is also minority. it still gives you an pretty good idea.
---
I haven't had my cereal yet so my math might be fucked but that's around 33k boxes to one infusion right? (Assuming that your luck was consistent to the odds)
---
educate yourself. its exactly how it works.
---
My personal tips for new players are:
---
 -start it with a fresh mind. Lots of changes from GW1, gameplay isn't static like WoW or other MMOs. Get used to the combat ASAP, like dodging and positioning. 
---
 -Try before you buy. The base game lets you play up to max level and then some. Don't spend a cent until you know you wanna stick with it, and then just get the expacs. Regardless, all of the expansion content is post 80 stuff, so even if you bought it there isn't anything you can do, so you might as well wait. 
---
 -Give each class a try, or in the very least don't stick to one if you don't like it. Some classes are squishier than others, some are better at group support than others, test them out and see what fits you best! Even if it is just the animations, fashion is a huge part of the game.
---
 -Take it slow, soak it in. If you played GW1 there is going to be areas you recognize. See what's changed, see what's new to you. The game really has a sense of beauty to it, and certain areas are just worth spending time in.
---
 -Ask map chat. This is one of, if not the most, friendly games I've ever played and people will go outta there way to help out. Use that, and also check out the wiki for more details on things like gear, stats, and combos. Just be careful of story spoilers.
---
It's a horrid animation (at least on human - haven't seen on the rest). Ranger sword auto is so much nicer, so fluid.
---
Downstate ability 2 for guardian, warrior, rev (I think), necro, ranger, and ability 3 for thief are all cc skills meant to interrupt stomps. Previous posters point is moot though, since ccing the pet doesn’t actually interrupt the res.
---
Everything in moderation is such bullshit advice when the producers make their products in such a fashion that the human mind is tricked into doing things in non-moderation. Why do you think we are talking about artificial scarcity: it's to trick the consumer to overspend. Why are lootboxes an issue: they are compared to ambling addictions.
---
You look at the menu at a fast food joint and you get enough sugar for multiple days in a single meal ... Moderation? Nothing about it.
---
Because isolating variables let's one better assess the differences between the two.
---
Fun fact: Board games are adopting for quite some time now. Early access is called kickstarter and DLCs are called expansion boxes or optional token upgrades. Fantasy Flight Games comes to my mind in that regards. I have probly spent more money within the last 3 years for three of their boardgames than I have spent on video games my whole life. Including my seven years old gw2 account. :D
---
Hopefully the lootbox discussion will not expand. I am fine with paying money for my precious board games. Luckily board games are not a mainstream media otherwise there would be a hell lot of discussion and bandwagoning.
---
Let me rephrase. Illuminati! Nsa! World ist flat! Dont trust yourself!!!
---
This happened to me last night. On a character that had 0 deaths.  I only realized afterwards that i could have used the trait to reduce fall damage by half. Might have lived.
---
Died like 6 more times now because after the first who gives a shit
---
Well the next piece of "content" this game is getting is Festival of the Four Winds. Right after Dragon Bash ends. So more fluff for the remainder of july and early august. I don't mind, coz I'm going on vacation, but I can see how people are getting worried about the lack of real news about the next season. Like "starts in autumn" or "will be centered around the effects of the newly sprung up well of ley magic right above the Deep Sea Dragon", or at least "new fractal for back to school update".
---
Although, in lotr Aragorn in a literal ranger but barely used his bow.
---
its really not that hard to understand, its just Power Vitality and Toughness
---
Ah, so I guess no balance patch next week then.
---
New meta, new legendaries, there was a new raid, not everyone has Skyscale. Not to mention all the existing content that is already in the game that most people don't have. News is coming but talking like we have gotten no news at all is just silly.
---
People seem to be pretty salty about this event returning, but the rewards are likely buffed since the met event rush changed the loot tables for the bonus box of goods. Even if these rushes repeat themselves, I really like the idea that we will have constant weekly events inbetween festivals, living world episodes, and other content patches. It seems like after they've designed them once, that it's not much work to repeat them. Hopefully we reach a point where we have a very large variety of these events too.
---
This time last year we got festival of four winds. Any idea if that will make a comeback?
---
The LS was two months ago, and all we have is a “road map” of a few features that are on the table. We know that there will be season 5, but we are in the dark. Are we getting more fractals? More CMs? Are raids done? Are we only going to see LS for another 1.5 years?
---
Which has already been tried.... many, many, **many** times. Everything from players, parents, politicians, etc - have all petitioned through different means and tried to get the ESRB to better regulate itself only to be met with inaction, fluffy PR responses, and just a hand-wavey "in game purchases" label that still doesn't affect the rating whatsoever. 
---
You're not going to get anything through the ESRB primarily because of how they're regulated. The ESRB is self regulating and funded by the very industry that it rates. It is in their best interest to have games with loot boxes because that means they get more.
---
Anyone else getting Sloth vibes from fmab? Lol.
---
The last 2 News that i consider actuall news were:
---
Meet the Key of Ahdashim on June 11
---
by The Guild Wars 2 Team on June 04, 2019
---
And
---
Removing Language Restrictions for EU World Linking
---
by The Guild Wars 2 Team on June 14, 2019
---
Both News only effect a minor part of the game.
---
It’s sad to see something that been asked for since forever (weekly/weekend events) now is getting hate comments in the top. Fuck yall retarded.
---
Never enough, the human mind craves for more.
---
Chairs are basically mounts (by function), surprising this one can move.
---
Could still be coming. They could easily announce it in the next few days or so.
---
The equipment in question is probably a reward from completing your personal story, which is why it can't be sold or salvaged. I'd just throw it away and not worry about it.
---
For gold, I'd make sure you're doing the dailies to get 2g. You can check your bank for materials that you're not using to sell ([gw2efficiency.com](https://gw2efficiency.com) will show you at a glance which materials are worth anything). In honesty, I'd not worry about it too much and continue working through the story. What do you want the gold for?
---
Deimos is incredibly easy as a DPS role. Most of the responsibility falls on the tank and the literal. I wouldn't really call that the standard for raids.
---
No they weren't?
---
&gt;We literally just got a newish festival after a **Living World Episode that added a bunch**.
---
That pretty obviously sounds like they're saying the Living World Episode was the thing that added stuff. Not the festival.
---
And I will love every moment of it.
---
I have trouble calculating many hits in the game, because of the heavy damage, and my tendency to play 11k HP characters. Like the slam from Samarog. Is it supposed to down or just hit hard ?
---
Actually, it depends more on lag. Sometimes lag leaves the adventure window open for longer than usual, so I get to click it much further from the start point and save 0.5-1s.
---
I agree. GW2 is now more than ready for next expansion, not another living world season.
---
You know what the problem is? LS itself is glorified filler content. We are getting filler between fillers so it's hard to get hyped. World Boss Rush isn't even content, just temporary extra rewards for 7 year old content where you press 1.
---
yeee make him work for it
---
I had really hoped that the boss rush was just the first of multiple ideas for events. I think we all assumed it would be back but  not this quickly.
---
The fact that its already back is pretty telling.
---
Not sure what's so good about it?
---
I love it especially with autorun enabled!
---
That's how you end up wiping your group because you didn't realize that Volatile Poison is murdering your whole group on Sloth. Or that you need to know a rotation for Sabetha Cannons, or that touching blue orbs in Goes destroys your DPS, etc.
---
Do a training run, even if you're a good player, just so you don't drag your team down from not knowing how a boss' mechanics even work. You're going to prevent a lot of wipes in the future.
---
contact anet, not us
---
I love it!
---
Do you take commissions?
---
ArenaNet likes innovation.  They don't like stagnant MMO norms.  The game puts a lot of emphasis on boons and buffs many of which are distributed in a limited, melee radius of around 600 range.  Considering the potency of such buffs in an instanced environment you're looking at losing out 25-30% worth of stats in terms of boons and profession oriented buffs in an organized group. 
---
Boons are not often provided for people at range.  For example, protection in GW2 is a 33% damage reduction.  If you down further away from the boss it will be much, *much* harder to save you.  People aren't going to pity you if you choose to range.  [You're missing out on really spicy offensive and defensive boons when you play at range.](https://i.imgur.com/dcScF7u.png) 
---
GW2 doesn't adhere to standard MMO norms.  We have DPS, support (offensive and defensive) and control (CC).  Every class is a simultaneous embodiment of every traditional archetype; it's up to players to build, assign and communicate roles.  Some roles are filled better by different builds, but a single weapon-swap, trait modification or utility-swap can be game-changing quality of life. 
---
You *can* play mid-ranged builds, but it is best to play them in melee because of how powerful organized boons/buffs are in GW2.  For example, many classes use a 900 ranged weapon which provides moderate range whilst staying in range of boons.  What you need to come to terms with is how powerful boons are in GW2; until you receive something like 6-9 boons you're ***clueless***. 
---
My main suggestion for you would be to go into the Special Forces Training Arena in the Lion's Arch Aerodrome (for raiding).  Create a squad (10 person squad) - don't need a mentor/commander tag; just use the UI in the top left of your screen / create squad.  Enter the SFTA and go over to the console on the right and give yourself as many boons as you want; preferably all of them. 
---
The goal of an instanced squad in melee in GW2 is to provide as many offensive, defensive and utility-based boons as possible and sustain them as needed.  The difference with and without boons in GW2 is flabbergasting - especially when you begin to optimize your damage and practice a rotation that benefits from sustained boons like might, fury, quickness and alacrity.
---
That’s easy: mounts are mobile chairs
---
Hits hard but not down, unless Samarog is enraged. Can be dodged and jumped over and much more.
---
Damn looks good
---
https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/wiki/Using-with-other-addons-and-overlays
---
If I was them I'd just use Living World Season 1 content. There are enough events to add as weekly or weekend events.
---
Anet finally realized that they don't need to put new content in their game. It's just rehashed festivals, world boss events and gem store updates from now on till the game is dead :)
---
Why wouldn't it? Even shitty dead-for-real games keep getting new players.
---
But I can guarantee GW2 isn't getting the numbers it deserves. The game should be much more appreciated, yet we're kind of a second class game.
---
It may have been that way back when LS1 or 2 were a thing, but now? Nah. War Eternal was one of, if not THE best storytelling Arenanet has ever pulled off. If you refuse to accept that as content, that's your own problem.
---
World bosses, sure, if you want to skip those I'd understand. But We're still in the middle of one festival and not far from the start of Festival of the Four Winds, so there's still plenty of stuff to do ingame. Whether you choose to engage in that content is your own choice. But if you choose to not do it, don't go complaining to the devs that there isn't content. There is. You're just refusing to play it.
---
Should've also be a travel toy too...........do people use those anymore?
---
I don't think GW2 explained itself too well either way.
---
Also, don't blame the customer for not consuming a product. You're the one doing something wrong if they don't want what you offer, specially when it's so good once you get used to it.
---
The story of LW is filler, the raids and fractals added during it are filler too. What pray tell do you not consider to be filler.
---
ow dude thank you man! tyty
---
Almost a sure thing at this point. July isn't happening and August seems too close for Anet's typical teasing, especially when the next LW chapter is a completely fresh start and will need a lead in.  
---
Maybe September at the absolute earliest.
---
Leave the forgotten out of this, they have nothing to do with this abomination.
---
Appreciate what you're doing.
---
great &lt;3
---
Ranger gives very little support, all of its ranged damage is reflectable, melee damage is useless because pirate ship meta. There are 0 cases that I want a ranger in my zerg instead of a herald or scourge.
---
Not the content we need but the content we deserve.
---
Mike Z’s time as game director has been a  snoozeville. I barely get on any more... there is like nothing to be excited about. I check on Tuesdays hoping they drop a bomb shell that makes me excited or refreshes the game even the slightest.
---
Singing "do wa diddy diddy dum diddy do."
---
When people get the wrong expectations, you better correct them, or you will deal with backlash later on. Yeah, not your fault they got the wrong assumptions, but it's your responsibility to transmit a correct image for your product.
---
GW2 endgame, for example, was not explained properly, and since then the "GW2 has no endgame" meme still plagues forums across the web.
---
I mean, it just looks like they are doing things just to avoid talking about the elephant in the room (Season 5).
---
well of course often repeted events turn into some kind of "background noise", thats why other events (wintersday and so on) only happen once a year, but I think it doesnt matter, its still a great addition to loot and there will ever be people doing these and be happy about these. I mean if they annoy you, simply dont do them.  And all the people that are doing world bosses regulary will be hyped over and over again I guess :D
---
making the scribe even more useless :3
---
I agree with you and HPetch but I wanted to say that additionally, the limbo we are in post-finale of LS4 and awaiting LS5 with the lack of idea of where the game is being directed to is surely increasing the negative reactions. I know it is for me. I got nothing against this event yet I'm feeling a tad aggravated that it feels just filling for them having nothing planned since it's a repeat so close to the last one. I want to know what are the plans for right now! Anet gave us better communication and some ideas of what's to come but it feels like we're lingering blindly as to when things are gonna pick up again and from being there before; I'm anxious on how long we'll have to be in the dark. I guess it's the same gripe I'll always have with the company, all that just to say I know that I'm not alone in this feeling and it's probably affecting people's receptions to repeat of filler 'content'. I do want to say that I appreciate them at least making an effort to fill the blank space inbetween at the very least.
---
Next time they should try to use game footage instead.
---
I wouldn't blame him from content standpoint. The whole company turned into making other games (mobile gw, etc.) and most of their resources was taken away from Gw2. Now they are back on Gw2 and we see new events (even though simple), let's hope new dope content rolls also soon.
---
&gt; Then, ranger instead of being a ranged (bow) class like the name of the class implies, is also expected to take melee weapons and fight close to the enemy. 
---
That is a problem with English not the game. The class is Ranger not Archer. Warden would have been a better choice for the class to avoid people making this mistake over and over.
---
&gt; but it's your responsibility to transmit a correct image for your product.
---
Yet we have thousands of players who loved the game at launch and sticked with it for years. Surely the image was clear enough for a fair amount of users.
---
RED FLAGS RAISED..... in another game i was playing the constant weekly events signaled to everyone the game was on maintenance mode/dead. I will prob do a WB per cycle unlike base rotation the first time cause WBing is boring as hell. But who knows maybe like during the crystal event I will do the rotation and get caught up on some reading.
---
Lord of the rings and Hobbit are best understood as inspiring first edition d&amp;d. 
---
In this context Bilbo is a thief, Gandalf is a magic-user, gimli and legolas are a dwarf and an elf (yes, those were classes), and aragorn is a fighter.
---
I personally like the Dominator skins, defiant glass, or equinox skins in terms of what you can buy on the TP. I would personally just save up and buy the Bifrost off the TP or craft it. I'm currently using the Bifrost and it is by far my favorite looking staff IMHO.
---
You don’t have a good grasp on anatomy
---
Singleplayer game? Have you played Dragonfall at all mate?
---
It’s absolutely something I need to work on.
---
try swtor, the game is worth playing if only for the story itself, ignoring the mmo aspect entirely. the amount of choice and the quality of writing in that game is outstanding
---
All these fancy-ass mounts and all I want is a horse..
---
F these fluff content. Looks like they've started working on another side project. Clearly nothing learnt from the events happened months ago....
---
I kinda wanna get it just to piss everyone off during Xera.
---
I hope you realise that you can't use the lvl 80 boost until you finish the tutorial and that you automatically lvl up after finishing. :)
---
Means you get this message no matter if you use the booster or not.
---
I would love to have that content as well, but seeing how fast they make current content and their past decisions aboit dungeons... i wouldn't have much hope
---
why sold separately? o well, i guess the people who buy both have the answers i dont
---
Were you around pre-HoT? I feel you didn't go through the days of Anet only reworking things and not adding new content. I never want to go back to those days EVEN if I want them to rework things right now. They need to strike a balance of both and what you're saying they *should* do is the opposite of that. I know it would be dull real fast as I've experienced all that content and for dungeons too many times to count that reworking them would not add in worthwhile entertainment but that doesn't mean I don't want them to go back on that content. I think they *should* work on reworks in the background and not make it the main focus :)
---
Reminds me of the classic "IT'S TIME TO SLAY THE DRAGON."
---
Marketers really don't have the slightest clue on how to market MMOs do they?
---
Well, yes, but actually uses an updated version of the GW1 engine. It's likely a lot of work went into it between the games. 
---
Should Arenanet decide that 2022 is the time to begin working towards a hypothetical GW3 they will either make another major engine overhaul, or acquire the rights to use a commercially available engine.
---
But isn't the lack of difference exactly my point? Both do no damage and one makes you squishier.
---
Not my classes. But you're also not the moron who bitched at me.
---
Sunscythe   [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sunscythe](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sunscythe)
---
Is this actually gonna be a thing?
---
This is the only real answer as this question is subjective
---
Just to finish bursting a bit the bubble that other MMOs tend to stay in here are a couple of fun facts about Gw2
---
* In PvE raids a light armor class will be the tank (the mesmer with the Chronomancer spec) mostly because of ample damage mitigation and role compression
---
* Greatsword is actually a long-range weapon for the Mesmer
---
* Revenant and Daredevil (one of the Thief sub-spec) use staff as a melee weapon
---
* Hammer is a long-range weapon for the Revenant (and is pretty good in WvW/RvR big group fights)
---
Using mostly melee weapons for optimalk damage is only really necessary once you reach the end-game and while you are in PvE you can play whatever you want.
---
As for Ranger even if they do more damage with some melee weapon (for Power builds) they can still use a Longbow. You have 2 weapon set available pretty soon so go wild, have fun, get a Greatsword and a Longbow, swap when you want/need to.
---
In GW2 no class really "should" be anything, classes can do most of the jobs a bunch of different ways. When it comes down to being "optimal" there"s of course only 1 way to be it and anyway everybody should be stacked together so ranged weapon won't be used that much from far away.
---
Can still leave vanilla dungeons as is, but just make a HoT and PoF dungeon series using a new system.
---
Setup:
---
Extract d3d9.dll from `d9vk-0.13.tar.gz/d9vk-0.13/x64/` to your `/Guild Wars 2/bin64/` folder
---
This stable release now works with ArcDPS
---
Just rename the d9vk version of d3d9.dll to d3d9\_chainload.dll
---
So, no Festival of the Four Winds then?
---
PvP is probably worthwhile, but raids are not popular *or* a selling point for the game. People who want raids would be much better off going to a game that focuses on them. 
---
Most new players are very likely coming for the open world content and the story. Look at the current marketing campaign. It isn't targeting hardcore players or PvPers at all. They are pushing the part of the game that sells and is popular. They are selling the setting and the story and the zerg fights.
---
&gt; and the myriad of "thx"s from rezzing peeps during the meta....
---
Yes I forgot "thx" was the pinnacle of interaction. A basic bot could do better.
---
But i guess everyone who doesn't agree with your opinion is a troll so you're right, we have nothing to discuss.
---
Well you should also have in mind that summer is time when many folks go for vacation, and thus is not really best to release huge chunks of new stuff. Sux to need hotfixing but the devs would be sunbathing within their rightfully earned free days. I would expect more serious stuff to arrive towards end of august.
---
I am so happy for this event. Another chance to make several hundred gold!
---
My poor CPU :(
---
I'm okay with player character textures, but some of the earlier weapon models could use a retouch.  Specifically the Aureate and Godskull skins.
---
No, existence is hoarding GOLD!
---
The textures in FFXIV are absolute garbage.
---
Like, with GW2, the resolution of the textures is something you need to try real hard to notice really. Just playing the game, I have zero problems with textures. If I start to notice flaws, I can find them, but it's not an issue unless I'm trying to spot them.
---
https://i.imgur.com/ZbtrlCP.jpg
---
This is the kind of textures they use on MAIN CHARACTERS in XIV. And it's not an isolated incident either. It's damn near any character that wears anything other than plain colored clothes. And they are obsessed with giving them close ups too.
---
It can be jarring with just how awful the textures look. Some things look better than others, but all the textures are objectively bad.
---
Maybe it is because they have scheduled vacations during summer, so having some big release would not be really feasible...
---
Ohh, I see. I'm so used to the tank being Minstrel himself, I never considered he could be max DPS as well. Good point.
---
Magnificent.

Living world season 4 ending cinematic: 10k views
---
Yeah much engagement.
---
They are marketing it based on what they want this game to be, but that's not going to take them far. Anet and the playerbase has been completely out of touch eversince the release of GW2.
---
This right here is why I'll be running this again.
---
&gt; It's not as big as that raid chair or the desert throne....I definitely gives off a Sith Star Wars vibe though. 
---
But those aren't gliders
---
They can barely get over 100 viewers with GW2.
---
Plz be troll
---
Aw, shame. Your art looks nice, and I hope to see more of it here!
---
On the bright side, you don't actually need to succeed at killing it. I unlocked it by fighting it until the event failed.

spinerek : Not even eye 100 OMEGALUL
---
I'm kind of okay with the soldier's gear I got from the 80 boost.  Example, I played Thief and Warrior for a good 4 years.  I'm good at avoiding damage and dealing damage with them, but I know next to nothing about playing Revenant and Mesmer.  Now, I have both a Rev and a Mes.  Mes was 80 boosted and Rev not, but I did level it to 80 with tomes.  I bought a full set of Zerk gear for my Rev and I die all the time because I don't understand the class yet.  However on my Mes I don't die nearly as often because of the tanky gear set.  I've started swapping out the soldiers gear for more offensive stat choices and I still don't die as much.  So even as a veteran player, not understanding how a class plays can get you killed and the soldier's gear from the boost is good for learning the mechanics.

Have you seen female bran? Would definitely smash
---
I agree, you can 100% be casual even if you play a lot, or even if you do end game content and pvp/wvw game modes. People seem to think the only way to be casual is to hardly play, but for me.. if you go into a game and you're not activly trying to be the best, or compete with other people to be better than they are.. you are casual.
---
The fuck lol? So confused, I was clicking through it thinking that this was some meme that I'm oblivious to.
---
So you're not even at Lvl 80 with full exotics yet? If so, then I have trouble believing you truly understand this game's mechanics yet, as nothing is really going to push you to really use them until (some) T4 Fractals, CMs, or Raids.
---
Regardless, no one is even saying that the raids are impossibly difficult in Gw2 or even comparing them to mythic raids in WoW, but that training runs GREATLY reduce frustration in groups because it means you can experience a fight and potentially get a kill without the pressure of being kicked for causing wipes rather than jumping into a raid with just video knowledge. There's nothing elitist about that. It \*is\* elitist however, to think you're better than others because you've completed something considered challenging. That is the definition of elitism. 
---
If you think you can do it, then go for it, I wish you luck and I really want to see those logs and videos, you should post them on reddit. Show those WoW skills.
---
I see Scourge and Firebrand symbols in the thumbnail, and so I immediately know this is 23 minutes of big brain strats. 
---
Also, why so much candy corn? D:
---
imo, it depends which generation legendary you want to go for
---
Generation 1 (twilight, flameseeker prophecies, kudzu, etc) actually have some sort of journey and plot to gathering them, so it was pretty fun and i didnt really mind the amount of crafting
---
Generation 2 (shooshadoo, shining blade, astralaria, etc) require the expansion packs, mastery points to unlock crafting Gen 2, as well as a boatload of materials from those respective maps. not to mention there wasnt really a story to it either, it was just "go get a stack of amalgamated gemstones" or whatever material you need.
---
i crafted two legendaries, one from generation 1 (twilight greatsword) and other from generation 2 (shooshadoo shield). I had wayyyy more fun and spent less gold farming and crafting twilight than i did with shooshadoo.
---
as for choosing between farming gold and farming materials, see if you could somehow combine the two. like "i'm on my way to this event for gold, oh look, some iron ore, i need that for crafting lemme grab that real quick".
---
either that or just farm your brain out from any events. farming trick-or-treat bags last halloween saved me a bunch of time and helped me craft a legendary faster
---
if you have any more questions or need clarification, dont hesitate to shoot me a reply or a pm!
---
&gt; If greater efforts were made in strengthening tactical gameplay and reflexes over damage rotations then maybe more build variety could be a thing.
---
The "problem" is good players can avoid basically all incoming damage (there's a video of an engi soloing 99CM mama and taking literally no damage, for example), and the damage that isn't avoidable isn't actually dangerous even in berserker's. 
---
even if you made "avoiding" damage harder, the best players will still be able to do it so the "meta" builds will still be glass cannon gear (berserker/viper etc). 
---
Toughness already has a secondary effect (it makes you more likely to be targeted by enemies), this only serves to make the meta gear for chronotank minstrels instead of diviners or harriers or something, it has basically zero effect on damage builds. 
---
Soldiers has its place in wvw and as training wheels for new players. 
---
The only way to eliminate glass cannon builds in gw2 style play would be not to let us have the gear in the first place: when vipers and sinister didn't exist, condi builds had variety between rabid and carrion because different classes valued power and precision differently. 
---
If berserker didn't exist we would see people choosing between the various 2 offense+1 defense stat lines depending on what they value more. 
---
The other option would be to find a way to make more than 4 stats matter to power builds (good luck, would require a full redesign).
---
No I am not trolling. You used to make good content. But now you only whining... Go to your youtube channel what you did a year ago, and what you do now.
---
You are the ones who kills the game with your unreasonable requirements for raids. "200 KP" "250KP" ect... You "elitists" are pushing away all new people from raids and then complain "why Anet is not showing more interest for raids from both players and Anet".
---
You want hardcore content and to get that you need a bigger playerbase to prove anet that it is worth their time. But you "elitists" are killing that interest in raids. Here is current LFG for raids. [Only selling/50-250 KP requirement](https://i.imgur.com/s5gYm7Y.png). So how new player can start doing raids when 1 out of 20 lfg parties accept newcomers?
---
1.0 was a better looking game in many ways. The textures looked better, the characters more detailed. The problem was the designers clearly never made a game before, and would use super high poly models for things that only needed like 6 polygons. Infamously, the 1,000 poly barrels and flower pots. This resulted in areas being less detailed, and a lot of copy pasting done for the open world.
---
2.0 fixed this, but I think went too far in the other direction. Now a lot of things have less polygons than they should, and the texture resolution on everything is pretty awful. I think they also designed the textures to be that awful, because SE makes it sound like it would require making everything from scratch to up the texture resolution. I think the highest resolution assets they have are what's in the game, and that's just plain stupid.
---
2.0 did make some other graphical improvements. For example, they added an actual lighting engine into the game, rather than just adding a blue tint to the screen for night time, but if you look at comparison shots, 1.0 isn't exactly a worse looking game. Some things look better, other things worse.
---
Oh yeah, and the only AA in XIV is a really bad FXAA. This causes the bad textures to look even worse, and doesn't fix the issues with the bad aliasing in the grass and trees.
---
map completion is good for 2 legendaries, and you get materials as you just play the game so you will always save some money doing that vs selling the materials for straight gold
---
Savings get even larger if you consider free mystic clovers from monthly rewards and wvw/pvp if you do those
---
Plus you can save even more money converting t5 mats to t6 for the gifts
---
Overall, crafting yourself is a lot cheaper unless you are really good at earning gold (like a market flipper or something like that), or if you really hate map completion (which is understandable)
---
The majority of zerg guilds running know each other in some way or another. The main reason a group raids in WvW is to fight other guilds, PPT and objectives are mostly an afterthought these days unless you're trying to position your server in a specific way. 
---
When a commander is pinsniped, it generally ends the fight before it begins, robbing both sides of what they are there to do. It's not something that happens much these days for that very reason. Usually if it happens it's by an independent group just trying to troll everybody.
---
Especially these days
---
I'd you'd have used the potion maybe you could've saved ten minutes of your time
---
Yay!!! It's so good! I love it! Great job on the modeling in particular. I wasn't even sure at first if it was a rip from the game or your own work. :D
---
because outside of the pressing 1 community, GW2 is a dead game
---
no
---
I never said I was, if you go back and read my first comment here you'll see that.
---
But it is sad and disappointing that y'all kick people for trying to raid when they haven't been doing it for years, THAT is elitist
---
I mean Anet is out of touch with the playerbase, the two want different things. Maybe i need to phrase it better, sorry.
---
Oof, that's a crazy amount of changes. A shame too, I've heard that it's a decent game otherwise
---
Where I said that specifically you requested KP? By saying "you" I mean raid community who asks for insane KP or other stupid high requirements. English is not my native language, sorry if there is a misunderstanding.
---
You are one of those few people who wants to introduce more people into raids and I am happy to see that. I would like to see more people following you.
---
You definitely act like it, but you don't really understand the game yet, so you can't comment on the endgame until you experience it for yourself. You yourself don't know how easy or hard this game really is yet. 
---
I haven't even been raiding for years. I've been playing the game on-and-off, but I still manage to do them. 
---
The reality is that no one wants to wipe on the same boss over and over just because a newbie is hiding among the group without saying a word and continuously failing mechanics that cause wipes. 
---
If someone is newer and they make it clear they're new but know the mechanics, they have a much higher chance of being accepted rather than quietly sitting there, dropping poisons on the group and wiping the whole squad and then being kicked. 
---
Training runs are recommended though, because they're specifically for people to learn the encounters stress-free so they don't even need to do that. Most of them don't even ask for ANY raiding experience or the correct builds or anything. Harder bosses do ask for correct builds or a tiny bit of experience just so the group can actually see the boss' mechanics without wiping over and over (greens on Dhuum). 
---
&gt;Elitism:  the attitude or behavior of a person or group who regard themselves as belonging to an elite. 
---
That includes thinking you know better than someone else just because you've done mythic raids in WoW, btw...
---
ANet doesn't reuse content, the playerbase is mad because they wasted all that development time on a one-shot.
---
ANet reuses content, the playerbase is mad because they're boring and out of ideas.
---
Come one. The choice wasn't "new content" or "old content". It was "reuse an event" or "do nothing". Why would anyone be upset with an event returning? Just don't play if you don't like it.
---
What legendary do you want and check gw2efficiency.com to see what you’re missing. Gen 1 legendaries are the only ones that can be bought but in my experience it’s easier to craft yourself BUT it’s almost always better to buy the precursor and finish it. Some of the collections and time gates are horrid. It’s true that some precursors actually have a benefit to crafting them but not all of them do. The mystic chromatic ooze is one of those bonuses you get from crafting Juggernaut.
---
is that what EU lfg looks like :,c 
---
im jealous......
---
You have no idea what you are talking about. Teapot always raids with random viewers.
---
Never said I wouldn't say I didn't know the fight either, nor did I say I mythic raised in WoW...  the amount of assumptions you are making is astounding
---
I buy them, i had a short luck streak on getting really rare dyes and flipped them for gold, then just got myself whatever I wanted. My account is broke af now. havent played in almost a year.
---
FB+Renegade &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Chrono
---
Yes, this!
---
Really wish they had gone that route--allow folks to save up and spend currency on shinies available at an event vendor.
---
I think it's a great game for your first time through all the content, but I quickly grow bored after that.
---
I played XI and 1.0 though. Both of those games weren't trying to be a linear path through content like XIV is. I just get super bored of content constantly being killed off because it doesn't offer any reason to do it, while the new content gives you the ever important "higher iLvL gear".
---
That and the open world is dead, because crafting for the current level requires mats from the current zones. There's no reason to go back to any zone, because nothing you do there has any importance. You won't get gear you can sell, cause the main story and dungeons gears you up from noob levels to max. You don't get mats you can sell, because everyone needs mats from only the most recent place. There's nothing to do, and as result, the most popular servers look like ghost towns outside the three starter cities, and whatever the current endgame city is.
---
When I came back to GW2 two or three years ago after XIV, it took a minute to get used to. I started a new class and leveled it the old way (no boosts, or tomes) and I never felt alone in the world. There was constantly people running around everywhere. It was a nice change of pace. Also, 7 years later we still have a market for copper ore.
---
&gt; In low level fracs (ie. anything below T4), it probably won't make much of a difference.
---
T3 is the trenches for a reason. T3 is when shit gets real and understanding the fights, you and your teams builds gets important. In T1/2 pretty much anything will fly because T1/2 are so forgiving. Imo T3 is the hardest tier of fractals for pugs and new players to the mode.
---
Open your own squad.
---
Necro OP, managed to survive till Eye 100, nerf coming soon from Balance team.
---
Shiny weapons were very good in that regard - you are guaranteed to get a colored crystal, and you can convert crystals into other colors, so even if the smallish amount of RNG still screws you, you're good anyway.
---
More rubbish to distract players from what they should be doing, which is farming and making gold.  Also it's just a lazy way to avoid adding content to much needed areas like fractals and raids. If not that at least work on central Tyria. They could at least bug fix them or other areas of the game e.g. dungeons. Of course I know dungeons will probably never be worked on, but I digress. The player base is already at their limit from the lack updates during those several months when the game wasn't being worked on at all. Plenty of players I know just left the game or are about to leave the game.
---
Nice, reward tiers sound nice.  The primary result of the last boss rush was just depression after realizing just how droprates on worthwhile drops were.  Having some garenteed rewards to make sure your time isn’t wasted is a nice change.  Looks like they listened to the feedback
---
This man carried my ass through dhuum CM. Never once asked for KP and literally didn't let me leave until I got the kill.
---
You sound pleasant.
---
It's true though. This is why very few servers were actually able to beat Tequatl during the event where she was updated. The active hardcore players were able to pick up on the mechanics within an hour, but it took the rest of the community months to catch on.
---
The whole idea of essentially just having to wait until the casuals lose interest and go do something else is really kind of like the game has its own built-in elitism. 
---
When you are dealing with time limited events, it's even more of an issue. The good players won't find themselves in a good group in time, the new players won't learn in time, and the lazy players won't go away in time.
---
I know people are disagreeing with you, but this is how I have always felt.
---
this isn't about reusing content or not. Its about how you do it.
---
You could have directed GoT season 8.
---
I like doing the one in Gendarren Fields.
---
I love how there is already a fully edited "They see me rollin' vid to this"
---
50 * 3 from dragon bash + 50 from these = 200 of some of the currencies. Very much welcomed for skyscale/legendary accessory/ascended accessories from me.
---
Its about raids. If you are full harriers you can play it in raids and fractals. If you are full minstrels you cant play it in raids because you mess with aggro from the high toughness. You can jump into wvw with full minstrels tho.
---
Clearly you don’t Chrono. The mere existence of one in the group is grounds for nerfing. Also scepter attack speed increased ~10%.
---
This is like the same level of terrible as the NES Legend of Zelda commercial!
---

Are you on some kinda drugs? It has the best textures from anything in the game, down to the velvetiness of the fabric and wooden grain, not to speak of the perfect marble texture that looks like actual marble for once.  
---
Stop playing on low settings.

Maybe I just misread your post, sorry.

Did you see the GW2 Efficiency stats of how many gw2e users completed DF story vs LS?

---
Good guy Anet, giving participation rewards.
---
I was in your shoes not long ago, I crafted meteorologicus after 6 years of playing the game lol
---
The first leggo you craft is going to be confusing and hard because you don’t know what to do, but I do recommend crafting it rather than buying one since it is way cheaper. You did say you don’t have much time, and farming gold or mats for buying it or crafting it will take roughly the same amount of time anyway. 
---
I do recommend your first leggo to be a gen 1 leggo though since they’re cheaper and easier to make
---
You make no sense, honestly. 
---
Why even bring up mythic raids in WoW if you've never even done them?
---
Why act so high and mighty when people just suggest for you to do training runs first?
---
If you're really so good, why haven't you done Mythic Raids? 
---
Why say this game is easy if you're not even at the endgame? 
---
Why complain about elitism in this game if \_you haven't even experienced it\_?
---
&gt; Never said I wouldn't say I didn't know the fight either 
---
So you shouldn't have any issues in this game then. All your complaints of the "elitism" in this game wont mean anything. 
---
If you're really so good that you can just watch videos and your previous raiding experience will carry you through, then go do it. You will have 0 issues in this game, but something tells me you're going to struggle to raid with your attitude and mentality. Good luck.
---
Can you expand on that, I don't understand what you mean, "how you do it"?
---
all i see is steven hawkin rollin again
---
I just said that I found it disheartening that there is elitist gatekeeping, that is all. Then I get told to basically go to a training raid because I'm not good enough to learn mechanics on my own
---
There's no horses left.
---
Charr ate them all.
---
To be fair, if there's a large enough zerg, there's no reason that everyone has to be doing a great rotation in order to kill a boss. Even in fractals or raids it just takes one or two good dps players to carry the raid. In open world it just takes a couple good players to deal most of the dps, and the rest is filled in with autos from players who don't wanna try as hard.
---
I think it's totally fine if this happens, as open world content is less about the challenge, and more about the community interaction, and working together.
---
I'm also in favor of open world content that requires some splitting up, as it's a challenge without relying on things like invul phases or other annoyances.
---
Get your map completion, dungeon (AC if I am not mistaken) tokens and mystic clovers first. You will get stuff you will need from that like mats and karma. Put in buy orders for the missing mats at the end.
---
Well, ill say best thing you can do is either try each class and weapon types until you find one you like, or choose an archetype that you like and see if you like it, and rotate to your next favorite, and repeat until you find what you like. 
---
Ranged is a thing that ppl use a lot so  just play whatever style you like for open world. I still staff ele on open world and wvw since its much easier to play and tag things. It wont really matter until youre raiding or on t4 fotm, which i dont think you are at atm.
---
If that doesnt work, make 8 characters of each class; welcome to althood.
---
so toxic :O
---
My bad. Let me just fix all the pugs to improve my gameplay experience. This is something I have control over.
---
People like to complain about GW2 being dead all the time, but it's really not. People are just spread out because of how much there is to do.
---
That being said, I'm sorry about FF, it sounds like you really enjoyed it before everything went awry. :(
---
Did you download it completely or just the playable part?
---
Largos have zero shoulder cannons unfortunatly...
---
Oh dope, thanks!
---
People put the lfg announcement for it under "Open World Central Tyria Squads", or "Open World World Bosses". I'm doing the one in Gendarran Fields at 12:20 utc+2 time. Player named Furako something runs them most of the times.
---
Part of the problem is that simple linear scaling just don't work for some mechanics.
---
Once you have exotic armor and weps, get Ascended (pink) trinkets.

* Rings are [cheap](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/BUY-2046_PFR) from doing daily fractals

Windows and Linux. Maybe even Mac with MoltenVK?

Oh awesome, I'll try that tonight then. Thanks!

Actually OP seems to be implying that it works on Windows as well... I guess it'd translate d3d9 calls to Vulkan ones, like d912pxy does for directx12? Idk.
---
Thank you, will do!
---
They did but Serpent's Ire didn't really work out that well.
---
I wondered if anyone actually used that face; kudos!
---
Boubb
---
They really just want everyone to get the Skyscale and/or Vision huh? Between the weekly Jorbreaker vendor and these new tiered rewards they are desperately handing out map exclusive currencies without ever setting foot in the maps. 
---
If they don’t want everyone to have the Skyscale for future map opportunities then why are they offering this stuff so handily? It just devalues the LWS4 map content otherwise. 
---
Having both the Skyscale and Vision and some of the bigger purchases on the maps I don’t know what I’d use this for... Converting to caches for materials to turn into liquid gold? At least Diflourite can make some ascended accessories?..
---
You should be able to get the tonic by just doing 1 boss a day. Let the farmers work for you. :)
---
but "right rewards" depends on what you need to do to get the rewards so what is right for one event isn't necessarily right for another event
---
Have you tried? Reshade's website says it works with the upstream DXVK

---
I’m expecting major reveals around GW2’s anniversary to mark the two years since PoF’s announcement and the four months mark since LS4E06.
---
It's a meme bud, the recycling content is hilariously pertinent though.
---
**ELABORATE**
---
That, my friend, is a threat.
---
Stop shilling
---
These are clearly just general rewards, not specific to the event.
---
Chrono is still a fine class. In fact, the meta comp for raids should be 1 Chrono and 1 Alacgrade + Quickbrand.
---
SoI can hit 10 man so it's still very useful.
---
Ungh. Can we maybe chill with the back-to-back events?
---
10% gold ? 30% magic find ?
---
I think Mordremoth’s death should have come at the end of the LS after HoT. 
---
It would have made much more sense and leave space to make a real story around the Nightmare’s court, Malyck, etc.
---
Correct, this can be for Windows or OSX.
---
Except destroying thief ofc
---
Exactly.
---
I know the one in the charr starting zone does if you can't do the very very last bit of jumping. The bad ending is on the left. The good is through a secret door.
---
not as fast as bloodstone fen of course but once you learn the way is way faster than any other map besides bloodstone fen. Probably the main reason for it is that there's no hearts.
---
&gt; So I know this is a bit late
---
The boat you want sailed so long ago it's already been scrapped. You're right, it would have been cool to do that. Just like with a lot of things in the game though, it needed to be done years ago and if they try to incorporate it now it's just going to be a mess.
---
LOL
---
Only had one go so far so only 9:23:440, though since it can complete the mount race surely this counts as another mount?
---
I've thought this too. I like the little bit of extra attention to lore the Elite Specs got in PoF but would still love a story focused collection. Maybe fitted into the ascended weapon collections so those who like to easily unlock the specs don't feel gated.
---
You can make one of every class and go into the PvP lobby to them against target dummies, AI and the FFA area against other players. You can get all the weapons to cover every possible weapon combination(excluding underwater) for less than 10 silvers. Since these are all white and blue you can just move them around through the bank.  In the PvP lobby you will have access to all the core skills and traits available to test out.
---
Maybe the first time ...
---
You keep them forever.
---
Easy fix if the developers remember that there are dungeons in the game. Maybe just buff them and boost rewards for an event. Like a hard mode or something plus bonus rewards for the week.  Boom, cheaply developed improved content
---
You know why many people ask for KP in raids? Because some are hardcore and don't want to spend 3 hours on a single wing. That is not elitist, they just want to do their bosses for the week and be done with it.
---
Not really. It doesn’t give any sort of gameplay advantage.
---
How it was in beta?
---
No sub fee, you keep the expansions forever. There is a high chance that the expansions will go on sale in August as that's the anniversary event.
---
I volunteer as tribute.
---
How many gems is it?
---
buy any or both xpac - Forever access to base game and xpac(s) content and systems. mainly Hot (gliders, Guild Halls), PoF (Mounts)
---
Play during any Living World episodes release window (from when it comes until the next one comes)  - that episodes for free.
---
Missed Living World episodes can be bought on gemstore for 200 gems each with season bundles.
---
By doing it.
---
I agree with you, and I think that's a very reasonable number.
---
I don't remember the exact numbers, but raids (at least normal mode) are designed for \~12k DPS. That's why you get 5man Gorseval runs with 1:30 min remaining.
---
No one should settle for the absolute bare minimun, but OP was putting it in a way that seemed that if you don't hit those benchmarks, you're not allowed to raid.
---
Its dangerous to go alone, take this stick.
---
Return already? Definitely running out of ideas.
---
&gt;I still die cause of the buring effect wont stop long after the fight is over. This is frustrating :(
---
That's the burning condition. It and other conditions (red symbols) will persist even after the enemy dies, some dealing damage (burning, bleeding, poison, torment, and confusion), some causing other problematic effects (immobilize, cripple, slow, chill, etc.).
---
To get rid of them, look for skills that cleanse conditions. Warriors, like most classes, have multiple, but my personal favorite is "Shake It Off!" It's a shout that cleanses multiple conditions on yourself and nearby players, breaks any stuns you're in, and has multiple uses that each recharge on their own. One of the signets, cleanses all of them when activated, while providing extra endurance (dodge energy) regeneration while it's off cooldown, and the healing signet gives you a boon (positive buffs, basically the opposite of conditions, symbolized by orange symbols) called resistance that doesn't remove conditions, but makes them ineffective while you have resistance, while the signet itself heals you every second while it's off cooldown. I think there's a shout or stance that also gives resistance, too.
---
But yeah, I'd definitely recommend "Shake It Off!" if conditions are a problem, as well as healing signet, less so for the active resistance than for the passive health regeneration, although the other heal skills are also good.
---
Amazing job. Thanks for sharing
---
Thank.
---
oh, oh god no
---
Huh? Running d912pxy with no problems at all and full performance on my 1700x, as well as any other Dx12 game.
---
Buy both, but if you can buy only one, get PoF first (having mounts help a lot). Eventually get also HoT - you get important part of the plot and best maps in the game (imho) with this expansion.
---
Another post like this? Can there be a reddit PSA of the search bar? Seriously
---
I hope they do something like this for raids/fractals. And I don't mean increase the loot all around the board but for example for every new player that you take with you on the bossfight you get some gold and the player gets some gold. Some extra LI or an extra roll on ascended chests or something like this. This would also work for players in fractals -&gt; help someone with a lower than current level fractal level -&gt; get extra reward. Progress past your current level you get some extra loot.
---
It’s been like that for years.
---
You didn't read the whole comment...
---
ok

Warrior is definitely at least semi-tanky. They have the highest health in the game, tied with Necros (although Necros do have life force as an extra health bar), not with Thieves (not sure where you got that info). Sure, warriors don't have the same access to invulnerability or healing that Mesmers or druids/revs have, so I wouldn't use one as a tank in raids, but they can solo champs and the like with the best of them. 
---
Plus it gets facerollingly easy if you use the defense traits (although I will concede that that might count as a specialized build). Auto stun break with stability and swiftness, auto invulnerability, heals whenever you use adrenaline? It's got it all.
---
I'm mostly concerned about how Anet will actually implement reward system / content in the future, if they will ever bother about actually making/reworking in game reward to be on par with gem store items. Thats all.
---
this is great! do you have a page where you post your artwork?
---
While the last LS update was in May (\~2 Months ago), they also stated that due to the layoffs and restructuring, the LS updates may not hit the 2-3 month cadence for a bit. Additionally, we have no context as to how that cadence applies to in-between. Also, it's summer time for most ANet employees, work is bound to be slower due to vacations and the recent holiday
---
We’re definitely getting LS for another 1.5 years. Season 5 has been confirmed for a while now. 
---
What season 5 entails however is completely up in the air however. It’s probably going to be story focused like every single other season before.
---
That's similar to what they attempted with the gen 2 legendary weapons - which got abandoned after the first four for being too much work.
---
Regardless of how he feel about it, it's never going to happen.
---
Wrath probably isn't the greatest example to use considering that was what many people consider to be WoW's last good expansion.
---
if you waited the first time until it said playable, then you havent actually finished installing the game, it just slows down while you're playing. if you click on something that hasnt finished loading yet, it asks if u want to wait by having it download in the background while you play, or if you would like to exit the game and download it **much** faster through the launcher. pick that one if it starts to bother you too much, and just take a medium break. it should be good to go afterwards
---
Lately I've just been posting on my twitter @DruidsForge. It's rather new but I try to do a couple sketches a week!
---
Do we have a due date for build templates yet? I know they announced them a while back but it feels like it's been 6 months...
---
A blog a week early versus release notes a day early.  What's more useful to the play base, versus what's more useful to anet?
---
Festival of the Four Winds released last year on 24 July. The world boss week ends on 23 July, so the festival is probably straight after.
---
Very cool
---
What are you on about the last two balance patch notes were released on the Thursday or Friday before the actual patch.
---
froma guy that struggles to draw even stick figures, that is indeed quick!. So I am removing some of the quotation marks on "quick".
---
Awesome drawing btw.
---
&gt;It feels to me like they are hinting to brief respite to the dragons plot.
---
Anet could go back to some love story aspect of the storyline?  That way there can be a short break from dragon fighting, and more focus on character development.  Maybe a look into the home situation of each hero as they live together, and find out what happens when people stop being polite, and start getting real.
---
I'm not really sure the Mordremoth plot would have had enough for a full LW season after the events of HoT. If all we did was remove Mordremoth's final confrontation from HoT at least. I mean, Season 2 already felt a little forced in stretching things out and forced in finding a way to keep the Commander off of that fleet of airships while being the first half of the HoT story.
---
It was able to work for Kralkatorrik because S3+PoF was more focused on Balthazar that lead into Kralkatorrik rather than be about Kralkatorrik the whole time (I just wish Joko got more screentime by 1 or 2 episodes).
---
Is this a chair or a Mount?
---
It could be interesting to have some sort of "Quarterly PvE Season". Players would create new characters, check an option to make the character seasonal, and see what they can do with it within the season. Seasonal characters would not be able to trade and have their gold made account bound, and they would only be able to enter instances with other seasonal characters, and their would have separate seasonal AP for story and instanced content that resets each season.  
---
Then we could have worldwide announcements for firsts. First Ascalon Catacombs, first level 80, first raid boss kill... 
---
And at the end of each season there could be a way to check a leaderboards for firsts on instanced content, fastests runs, least deaths, most AP earned, most wealth accumulated, more recipes learned, etc.
---
I think this pve community would want participation leaderboards based on amount of mobs/events tagged because that's the true endgame in gw2.
---
Obligatory "if you want raids play other games" comment.
---
^^^PS. ^^^I ^^^like ^^^your ^^^idea
---
It doesn't matter what we want because ArenaNet isn't interested in a competitive community outside of PvP/WvW.   Even then the amount of support given to those communities speaks volumes.
---
Not gonna list it all, but haunted armor hasn't returned I'm afraid.
---
If I buy the Digital Deluxe Upgrade in the gem store for 2000 gems, do I get the Heroic Chest containing the special armor sets? Wiki says to get the Heroic Chest, ["Purchase the Digital Deluxe Upgrade in the Gem Store"](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Heroic_Chest), but at the same time, they say ["This upgrade will also grant you a Heroic Chest, only if you already had the Heroic Edition of the game"](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Digital_Deluxe_Upgrade) on the Digital Deluxe Upgrade page. Getting mixed messages from this. I've never purchased the Heroic Edition of the game, only the expansions. Do I still get the Heroic Chest if I upgrade to Digital Deluxe?
---
Now that's quality armour.
---
Uhh guys this might be my fault. [https://imgur.com/0IWcL1o](https://imgur.com/0IWcL1o)

&gt; Nicely explains away any effects of bloodstone madness on our character.
---
In all honesty, it doesn't. The effects of no madness was more-or-less explained in S3E1, specifically during [Reaper of Magic](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Reaper_of_Magic), where we hunt down a White Mantle Zealot who's got this fancy dancy [ancient relic](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ancient_Mursaat_Relic) that allows them to safely absorb unbound magic.
---
We never got hit by the Bloodstone explosion or chomped down on bloodstone to become bloodstone crazed, and Mordy and Zhaitan never really exploded (nor did Joko or Kralk). Then our connection to Aurene helped out with Balthazar, the only real case of us being exposed to a shit ton of magic besides the ley-line anomalies that the shadowstone is about.

Telling people to go away doesn’t help the game. It’s self destructive. There are games out there doing more for less, and players aren’t going to come back if they’re hooked by games you tell them to go play instead.
---
I didn't I said go and play another game till season 5 starts up. I don't want them to leave completely. Right now I'm playing other MMOs and logging into GW2 to do dragon bash dailies and the race time trial. And next week I'll be logging in to do the world bosses. Once season 5 is announced I'll leave the other games and come back to GW2. Thats why GW2 is so good to me.
---
A lot of active defenses are either class mechanics (virtue of courage, distortion, diversion, scourge shroud skills) or slotted utility skills - they're not just limited to weapon skills at all.
---
Honestly what matters more than any defensive stats or active defensive is *simply knowing the encounter and/or mob.* Knowing -what- things to avoid and save dodges/blocks/invuln for, what each animation means per mob type, which AOES to avoid. Knowing the mechanics in any instance will be infinitely more useful than having 2500 vitality.
---
In addition to knowing the tells and mechanics, the best way to avoid damage is to *simply not get hit*. Move around, avoid aoes, move to the side of melee swipes, move out of range of them. A lot of melee mobs are rooted in place when they cast an attack. Example: A favorite trick for my squishy melee characters when dealing with bosses with long attack animations/windup? Simply move through them before they finish casting. Do it over and over and if you time it right, even if you have aggro, you'll never get hit until they use a different attack.
---
Another final tip: Knowing when to utilize CC. PoF's hero point's are a good example of this - pretty much every single one is a veteran with a breakbar. You'll have a difficult time doing a lot of damage to them until you stun them. When they're stunned, just like champs, they suffer from the Broken debuff and take more damage... Which is a very good time to unload on them, nevermind the precious seconds you get without being attacked.
---
The idea is kinda the same qT had with their 3 man

just since we were only 2 ppl we could have corruption for the entire first 10min which made it possible to avoid any sacrifice besides the first one which we skipped by the person going downstate that did not have the corruption.
---
After Matthias hits enrage the sacrifice machanic gets disabled so nothing to avoid there anymore

And if you overeat sugar for one day and do that every two months for the rest of your life, what exactly do you think will happen to you? What do you think animals do naturally in the wild? Have a balanced diet? They eat that's available. We have brains. We should use them. The same way you seem to be.
---
What da frig
---
Not gonna lie, I'd buy a police car mount skin. Bonus points if it's the Skimmer and you can just hover with it.
---
You literally said ‘Go play another game and wait for season 5 the game isn’t dead’. 
---
Telling people to go elsewhere and stop playing just makes things worse. We should be encouraging people to play the game, but Anet is the most liable for that responsibility.
---
Thursday or friday before a tuesday patch isn't really a week before, is it?
---
Thanks I hate it
---
Setting aside the opinions on the state of the game, my point was there's still enough Warcraft lore to push out more expansions just like there's more than enough GW2 lore to have years worth of story content alone.
---
Events like this highlight how bad the loot tables are in GW2.  You could farm this event for many hours and you’ll only ever get low tier vendor trash, low tier crafting mats and a small amount of exp boosters. 
---
It would be actually be quicker and more rewarding to do the Daily Fractals instead of the Boss Rush Event.  Even at Tier 1, you’re still getting better reward than the Boss Rush event.  
---
In my personal opinion, send ANET a message and do anything but the Boss Rush Event this weekend.  Apologies if this does sound a bit cruel but it has to be done I think.
---
People don’t seem to realize that Medium armor has been getting leggings since launch but the issue is that the chest piece trenchcoat extends until the footgear
---
Not enough people do raids. Dead game mode.
---
She has seen some shit.
---
Not disagreeing with you, but listing a few known training guilds might help more, because casual players may have no idea how to find them besides spamming map chat.
---
I myself have no interest in raids or I would list some, but I literally don't know any.
---
Oh ok cool! What about the thing between the mystic forge thing and the armistice bastion portal scroll
---
Not a problem if you know how to deal with it!
---
DISCLAIMER: I'm highly aware this is from a YouTube video, and that this helped me out so much so I thought I'd share with those who've never seen it and may need it in helping them decide classes new or not.
---
I'll post a link soon to the associated YouTube video. :)
---
&gt; they probably don't even have enough of it planned out
---
I really hope they do, or the game is going to die. The way they do content is they have teams and one is always working on the next patch X months ahead of the other team. The next patch should easily be almost done and the one past it already being worked on. If they don't have enough planned out them the room is on fire and the game is about to burn down.
---
5 hours???
---
I love the concept behind this...but two things,
---
1.  Please make it scalable.  That is allow a solo player to have fun and challenge as well as groups of varying sizes.
---
2.  Please add in a "save mode option".  I have bad hands and there's no way I could reach even 1 hour, and many people have schedules that don't allow them to play for so long at once.  Allow a way so you can exit the arena and it can save your progress.  
---
This allows everyone to enjoy this.
---
Kaboom: https://youtu.be/KhI-G1Yr-Dg
---
I'm fine with these festivals but what annoys me is Anet is treating them as replacement content which they are not. It is nothing but fluff to distract us about the lack of information. The fact they have these happening so often screams something bad is going on at Anet and they need to get *something* out to us.
