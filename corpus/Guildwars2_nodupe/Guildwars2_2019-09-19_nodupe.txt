I’m probably right there with you.

That's fine, I'm sure there are other games out there for aesthetically-challenged people.

Why is it bad design? I prefer to have non account bound options.

Yet again Anet shows a complete lack of understanding of why scourge is so strong in WvW. The increase to number of targets will in all probability make scourge even more oppressive in WvW.

---
Due to the increase to number of targets so long as sand savant is traited this 'nerf' is probably a buff in WvW. Therefore in WvW the strongest offensive class will be even stronger.
---
Pretty much this. Instead of spending effort figuring out how to game a fictional market, I just put that effort into my real life career and investments. Hell of a lot easier to just play how/when I want and drop a hundred bucks for gold when I'm out
---
They're good at keeping secrets. And making you open up to yours
---
&gt;You're rewarding now whoever try to minmax their farming, instead of playing the rest of the content. 
---
But that is already how it works, so, again, how is that *changing* anything for the worst?

So apparently the microphones were already around in the time of the Khan-Ur?

Alternately, the legions looted that vault ages ago, and replaced it with new stuff for the festival ... would explain how you get the keys.

I would suggest doing all the missing LS episodes and other content you missed. Dragonfall is a particularly good gold farm.

---
Thank you for that second one, I was wondering how to get it.
---
&gt; I said you are wrong because in your post you are implying that this is a design flaw and a problem that needs to be solved due to poor balancing, but the reality is that even with trade restrictions people will always find ways to profit off of others. 
---
And in PvP players will always find ways to make one class more effective than others. That's when you do a balance pass.
---
There's also a collection achievement that you can get by moving items back and forth between your bank and inventory a few times.
---
It's not *every* single NPC. Only a disconcertingly large fraction of the male Charr.
---
You stack your group with scourges have half use ranged shades, have half wait for push. Make no mistakes this is a buff to scourges in WvW.
---
I'm the opposite. I want Taimi gone.

---
you could just read, it's only wvw
---
I don't think that's a good analogy because PvP is inherently competitive and there is no need for people to do it in order to function, but using a market board or trading post or auction house is necessary to get what you want and need in a timely manner for all aspects of the game. The amount of people that actually play the market is definitely &lt;1% of the entire playerbase, and it wouldn't make sense to restrict the other 99% based off of them to make their everyday experience less enjoyable. In PvP the amount of people who play whatever the currently OP builds/class is not 1% at all either. Totally different situations tbh.
---
Yeah, yeah. Eight months too late.
---
Keep it up man
---
Wells are a bomb. Group is still going to carry a few revs around of their own, even if 40-50% of it is scourges. They DONT NEED TO SHADE BOMB. They well bomb you and wipe you. If the well bomb fails they walk away till wells are back. It's the epitome of pirateship and its fucking gross and boring.
---
Someone has to get it first to unlock on GW2eff I thought....and yes, it doesn't tell you. The prop one makes it sound like you stand on stage
---
Umm, none of those really suit burn builds. If you play in open world it’s not gonna matter as much. Anywhere else, it’ll be hard to pull off. 
---
It might be easier to use those in a power build. Scepter/focus + greatsword has been the meta for power Guardian for a while.
---
what if I kinda want Taimi sometimes but not other times?
---
This guy was great
---
You're never forced to do hearts, just like you're never forced to harvest nodes.  It's 6 or half a dozen, they're both repetitive methods of getting the map tokens.

Buff everywhere. Now you really will just take Sand Savant everywhere cause massive cleave.

Amen.

Game won't open for me now. Get launcher, hit log in, hit play, launcher disappears and nothing else appears. Task manager shows GW2 client with using 12GB of RAM. Anyone else have this issue?

Welcome back from August 2018!

Oh. It could be interesting if you could upgrade them. But one, get 1 gathering. Then you can use 2 more to get more gatherings.
---
Please remove your post so that noone sees it and this devil offspring stays buried forever. Seriously, please never put her in an episode or expansion or whatever again, except if it's a huge celebration of her finally being gone.
---
Please point to where shades corrupt. With unending corruption removed that got completely taken out of the game basically. I guess there's that one boon rip from the curses line.
---
I don't think you actually play WvW.
---
What? It means you have to be more careful when you use shades, increasing the importance of that decision.
---
Do you have any addons (arc, etc.)?
---
Yeah, trouble shooting now. Disabled d912pxy and it opened up
---
I am glad we do not have repeatable hearts.

---
That "bing-bing! bong-bong-big!" just killed me.
---
One argument in favour of increased target counts is that it reduces the effectiveness of blobbing. 
---
Say you wanted to buff shade and you had to decide between doubling the damage output, or doubling the target count. In terms of total DPS they are the same.
---
As I said above you stack more scourges in your group have some use shades have some use wells using shade abilities on themselves, bingo scourges make groups stronger than now.
---
No. W5 is.
---
Wells corrupt boons as well.
---
Repeatable hearts are problematic because it's nearly impossible to balance time to finish across all hearts. Many hearts are just faster or overall easier to repeat.
---
That leads to issues where a player with 20 characters may repeat one single heart over and over instead of just playing on the map normally. I don't really think that's great design
---
How is it "objectively hilarious?"
---
That's what happens when you chill with humanity for too long
---
Omfg yea. Kralkatite ore is... Garbage. If you want all the weapons it's like 32000 ore or something
---
Sounds like slavery with more steps
---
its the endless boon spam, then corrupt, then conversion. Boons are a serious problem in the game, its just hard to see due to how oppressive a single class is
---
I really dislike the dmg standardisation of Revenant's hammer 2 :(
---
That should be a WvW exclusive change tbh

It's either super silly that it's got those long legs. Or when they update the construct in a future patch, it's gonna get crazy.
---
&gt;until third expansion
---
If it even comes...
---
Yeah that's not how it works. People die in story missions too. Simple counterpoint. But sure, let's end the discussion here.
---
This episode simply made even more apparent the fact that anet only has 2 or 3 VA voicing all charr npc these days
---
And I'm actually terrified that they are going to do the same with norn npc. Especially considering how they haven't had to voice a significant number of norn npc since the personal story
---
You should play through the Gears of War games. He's great in those.

It's a Netflix anime about a meek office lady that has a secret hobby to go all out singing death metal songs at the karaoke. Really cute characters, I love it heh.
---
When I got a high value item, and sold it outside the trading post, I had to send it to the buyer first.  It was a bit nerve wracking, but he was the server owner of the discord I was invited too, and those were his terms since he had a lot of karma on the gw2exchange, and I had none.  I understood why he wanted me to send first, and it worked out okay.
---
Well, hearts are a more open take on missions. Instead of giving you a mandatory task, they give you multiple...and events are a more dynamic take on quests, so...yeah. It's normal that they can somehow feel similar.

I'd like at least one ranged option on Necro and it just got gutted. Scourge doesn't need a melee component. We have Reaper for that.
---
Then they would need to nerf scourge more. The 2 specs are interdependent, without firebrand scourge would be completely dominant, without scourge nothing dies.

Gonna piggyback on this thread, apologies in advance. Anyway, OP is a troll, do not engage. Here's one of their 'bait threads' several months back: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bkcy9v/like_a_helicopter/
---
Thanks mate. My wife is around though she'll help and my guildies are all pretty helpful, but I appreciate the offer.
---
Yeah. It is. 
---
Both are easy, but I did the strike first try and without specifically building for it or having ANY knowledge of it.
---
Same! They were the first NPCs I listened to during the instance and was somewhat disappointed after discovering it was script.
---
This has been a long-time complaint of mine and I'm really, really happy to see Anet addressing it. The last few seasons have seen them literally make achievements that award 0AP, and it's nice to get into a map that has a long, satisfying list of tasks for my ADHD monkey brain to screech over.
---
Probably not. Item ID might be different but the script it triggers is likely the same one.
---
It would be better if APs be limited to instances because they are accessible on demand out of order.
---
Can confirm Murakai, dropped for me earlier on.
---
You're meh. Get out of here. Go on.
---
Next: Human Yawn Animation
---
They haven't abandoned raids at all actually. This is Anet trying desperately to keep raids afloat. They see the declining population and want to get more players into it so that they can justify continued developed of raids. 
---
Raids give players something to work towards. Knowing that there is always a higher plateau of skill that you can reach eventually, even if you're not interested now, is important to player retention. Releasing a stepping stone into raids like this, bolsters the raid population and keeps the gamemode alive to continue to provide that higher plateau. 
---
Anet has the economic figures however. They know that raiders are literally the population with the lowest gemstore sales. They know that it's a loss leader. They are trying to move the higher-profitability casual population into the raiding gamemode at least a little bit, so that it bumps up the sales figures for the raider population, justifying their continued development.
---
All of you forgot about the commander(us) fucking up in some kind of way and then having to clean our mess.
---
If you search the wiki for "event timer," or type /wiki ET in-game, you will be brought to a page that shows you all the events going on for the next two hours. Claw of Jormag is under "Core Tyria &gt; World Bosses." If you don't see him in the list, it means his spawn is more than two hours out.

I got 2 yesterday, and 5 today. Could only wish it would be more predictable in output like the others.

I have a bigger issue with the peppers themselves, though. They can't be sold, salvaged, consumed, etc. The only option to get rid of extras in the future is to destroy them.

Is this a new skin or outfit? I just finished map completion and all the big events once but haven't dove into the new update. Idk what all nea cosmetic wise yet

Wtf all said gw2 is like game of thrones?! Nothing similar, there is no intrigue like in a series or even in book! If you taking about lore so it more like wheel of time or stormlight archive. Developers takes alot from books like that. For example we have Yasna in Istan or sunsper is like aiel. And to all taimi kind and not alcoholic!
---
THIS IS BASICALLY AGGRETSUKO IN A NUTSHELL!!!!!!
---
The contact Taimi at every step of the PoF main story one? You don't need to do a full play through again. Go stand on one of the communication locations and do the replay for achievements option for each PoF step in your story journal. Once you've had a brief conversation then select the next step.
---

---
So... when is this outfit coming out again? &lt;.&lt;
---
Nah, this's just a big mood :P Outfits on the pictures are made up.
---
Again, why does PvE have to suffer so that they can create the illusion of balance efforts for a pretty much dead gamemode?
---
Firebrand for example. And looking at scourge there specifically, that's a big F there for heal scourge in raids. The rewoked shade placement is the pinnacle of inconvenience for some of the trait interactions. At least raise the target cap when traited to 10 aswell even when there's no shade active.
---
this guy gets it, hearts were optional, so no reason to hate them so much, you could still gather currency or get in with events. Why the hell is this hate comming from?
---
thats right, other map with hearts also had permanent magic vendor, but these trolls and haters dont want to remember that
---
agree, there is no reason to hate hearts, they were optional anyway, we are doing same shit everytime at the end
---
A little to try hard, dude.
---
&gt;I don't think that's a fair parallel to make because PvP is inherently competitive and there is no need for people to do it in order to function, 
---
The marketplace is far more competitive. using PvP exploits might cost someone a few lost matches, but marketplace exploits distort the economy in favor of the traders, at the expense of the average player. 
---
&gt;The amount of people that actually play the market is definitely &lt;5% (probably closer to 1%) of the entire playerbase, and it wouldn't make sense to restrict the other 99% based off of them to make their everyday experience less enjoyable.
---
It does when the actions of those 1-5% negatively impact the other 95-99%. If only 1% of PvP players were in on a cool trick that allowed them to dominate every match, then you can bet the other 99% would want that nipped in the bud. 
---
&gt; In PvP the amount of people who play whatever the currently OP builds/class is not a small percentage at all either, if anything it's the most or one of the most popular things to see around in it. Totally different situations tbh.
---
And that would be the only difference, that in PvP, if there is an OP option, it is usually quickly disseminated and relatively easy to pick up and perform yourself, allowing everyone to participate roughly evenly. Marketplace shenanigans, on the other hand, tend to be very obscure and arcane. You claim it isn't a problem because "maybe only 1% of players do it," I would argue that it's *primarily* a problem because only 1% do it. If it were something that 90% of players did about as well as anyone else, *then* it wouldn't be a problem.
---
really ? this is how you answer to those who were trying to help you?
---
"YOU ALL ARE WRONG AND DO NOT REMEMBER AND ME AND ONLY ME IS THE ONE WHO IS RIGHT"
---
this is not the best approach.
---
and btw if u really cannot complete that story u should reconsider your whole build and equip and reflex.
---
Because? 
---
What stopped you from being interested before? How did the strike mission help with that?
---
Renown hearts were originally not planned for GW2 at all, with dynamic events being the meat of open world. But, players asked for more traditional MMO style quests. So, ArenaNet added renown hearts to the leveling zones to train players to go to places where dynamic events happen.
---
That's all that renown hearts are. They are GW2's PvE training wheels. They teach you to go to places expecting dynamic events to occur.
---
No level 80 content should have them. They are nothing but filler and fluff, and when they actually restrict you, they are worse than that.
---
What if there's no dynamic event in the heart's area, but you need to unlock the vendor for the 18th time? You're stuck collecting 20 bear asses or whatever the hell requirements the heart has, and only get 1/4th as much experience and karma as you would for a dynamic event.
---
They are never a *positive* thing. They are essence of grind. They are purposefully designed to be repetitive and not fun, to encourage players to do dynamic events instead. Well, then why have them at all, if by level 80 you should know to seek out the dynamic events by now??
---
Isn't that how the recipe works?
---
It's a weird race called sylvari :P

Hearts were neither...
---
I actually finished the 300 balloons achievement before the 25 unique balloons achievement.
---
In case anyone was wondering, my 25th balloon was the far one mid/next to the keep wall, directly facing it. The reason why I never shot it was because blended in with the wall; has similar colors. I only noticed it because I saw a red speck from the targets on it.
---
Oh such wishful thinking, if only
---
It's on High
---
Steve Blum seems to voice a lot of minor and no-name NPCs in this game and other games and shows, so I'd speculate that he's not that expensive or exclusive. Rytlock feels like pretty much the game's mascot, so it'd be ballsy for Anet to kill him off.
---
yeah punching people in real life doesn't make much noise; +200 realism bonus
---
Post processing turns the game into a muddy blinding mess, it's better left off
---
This exactly.  
---
My main criticism of the original post is that they didn't account for the organizer party having to spend time to generate leads and promote... Find willing workers, find deals on materials, find and use those out of game trade sites and make the deals happen.  
---
They aren't "out there in the fields" but there are time sinks for the organizer making this happen as well, and as noted, they aren't pulling some fantastic profit off one poor schmuck who gets suckered into it, those numbers suggest the profit margin for the organizer being ~9-10% per worker they find.  That means the organizer has to go gather more leads and workers and make more deals for them to see strong profit;  Doing this takes time and it's a commitment that they can't afford to slack off from once the ball is rolling.  
---
If anything, what the OP showed is an expression of a idealic version of what IRL business should want to be...  But it's worth saying that the medium of the game shields this system from a whole lot of places where IRL has turned this very ugly.
---
Or the 100 cooking assistance.
---
Or the 500 crazed fans.
---
Or the...

Seriously what the hell? :|

Draconis Mons for the flax circle.

Every three hours on xx:30. There's one a half hour before reset, and then every three hours throughout the rest of the day. Like the other person said, the [event timer](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Event_timers) is your friend - it's a really helpful tool to keep track of world bosses and metas that are on a set schedule.
---
&gt;That's a problem for your guild, not the raid itself.
---
It's a problem for Anet when 99% of the playerbase can't play such content. It's then simply not worth the dev time.
---
&gt; It's supposed to kick your ass until you do it right.
---
Which is only done by hardcoreplayers. If you want a game which is played by maybe a few tenthousand players: go on.
---
&gt;Dungeons and lower tier fractals.
---
Content as new as Guild Wars 1. Has everyone played in 2012-2013 and since then never touched again. Especially casual- and coregamers don't farm content thousands of times. Some players do their daily dungeon tours or daily fractals. Hardcoreplayers. If you want a game for a few tenthousand players....
---
&gt;They do, it's just everyone turns off camera shake for good reason.
---
You completly missed the point. Does a banner double team damage? Tripple it? Quadrouple? It doesn't. Players see no difference in damage numbers. It seems to do nothing - or nearly nothing. So players don't use it. 
---
I'm refering to the shitty design of dozens of "+5%" damage buffs. For unexperienced players are those small buffs not noticeable. That's bad game design. Fewer, but more meaningfull buffs are better.
---
&gt;Some of the more difficult bosses, yes. Other bosses have mechanics that, when failed, can cause a wipe or just make the fight substantially more difficult such as missing a cannon at Sabetha.
---
You are thinking of way too hard bosses. Bosses as kholer wiped whole teams with their spin attack. A beginner group which was not able to properly dodge it was mostly busy rezzing each other. Many bosses got such hard hitting attacks. Or see thaumanova fractal endboss. If people fall off they die.
---
Better design is: there are 10 incoming attacks. You can't avoid all. A good player gets hit by three, his healer has less to heal - and can run more dps. A bad player gets hit by 8, his healer has to struggle with mana - but manages to keep him alive if he is decent.
---
&gt;The most common healers all have a resource
---
You rarely have to decide between using a cheap skill and using a more powerful skill. You don't have to wait for mana to regenerate. Usually you have to manage cooldowns and mana. In GW2 just cooldowns. GW2 is dumbed down.
---
&gt;False.
---
Good luck when staying in lupis bubble. Good luck when dropping of a platform in thaumanova. Good luck when bomb explodes in observatorium. Most bosses have hard hitting attacks which you are supposed to avoid. If you facetank them they are usually not "does 10% damage" attacks. Which would be the better design.
---
&gt;Okay, so how did people figure out Giganticus Lupicus back in the day?
---
Casuals don't. They run ranged and hope to survive, while rezzing fully dead players if someone else has aggro. No one knows lupis animations. Except hardcoreplayers. If you want a game for few tenthousand players....
---
&gt;Aegis has 2s minimum duration
---
Y, duration is not why aegis has a short time span. It's because aegis gets removed after the first hit. As comparision: GW1 aegis gives a party wide 50% chance to block incoming (physical) attacks - for ~15 seconds. Every noob monk could use it. Fire and forget. It lasts for these 15s, reduces physical damage by ~50%. Easy to use. GW2 aegis is very difficult to use. If it gets triggered by a random low dps attack it is gone. For beginners is therefore regeneration stronger. They are not good enough to make use of aegis. Many GW2 skills are like that. For beginners are these skills garbage. They are too difficult to use. So they don't use them - and are getting "trained" by the game in a wrong way. Game trains them to run fullsoldier and regeneration instead of fullzerk and aegis. That's bad game design.
---
&gt; then learn what attacks are worth blocking and what aren't. Everything has an animation tied to it. 
---
Which is something hardcoreplayers do. If you want a game which caters only to a few tenthousands...
---
&gt;Wouldn't difficult to use skills create these situations? You need to understand when to use your skills and not just spam them, very much like utilizing mana properly instead of just pooping out all your big heals and then having nothing for when they're actually needed.
---
No. In videogames there is usually "pressure damage", which means you get hit by many small attacks. You can avoid some, but not all. Good players can avoid more than bad players. Good healers can heal better than bad players. Imagine this as some form of degeneration (the damage you get) and regeneration (the heal you get). Game devs can now balance both sides and this results in varying difficulty. Difficult content forces you to avoid more attacks - or your healers run out of mana. It also forces your healers to spend their mana more efficiently - or they run out of mana. It forces you to use active defense properly.
---
This means: in easy content a noob player faces some challenges and learns to avoid damage - and noob healers learn to spend their mana wisely. Content gets step by step more difficult and they learn  step by step how to avoid attacks and how to heal. In GW2 are attacks (especially when running fullsoldier) either very weak and can be completly ignored without learning anything. Or attacks are very hard hitting (like instead down or instead death - but even 50%+ liveloss is too hard). This is not training them to manage their mana. It's also problematic because not all enemies are having the same animations. So a beginner gets hit by some random attack which causes him to lose half/all his life. This results in frustation, he somehow slowly and painfully does the content (or gives up). It wasn't a fun experience, he never returns in this content. GW2 is not gradually increasing difficulty, is not training players. Is not slowly increasing the "degeneration". GW2 is, out of a sudden, punching you straight into the face. Good for hardcoreplayers, bad for casuals. These casuals never get trained, never get good, don't gradually become more invested into the game. They enter (as example) raids, fail at first raid (VG) at like 95% of his life left: they hit the wall and realize this is not doable for them. So they return to open world, roll their face across the keyboard in soldiers gear and succeed. -&gt; Not enough players are doing raid content, for Anet it is not worth developing new raid content for so few player: here we are.
---
Ofc are these issues not fixable in GW2. Is more relevant for GW3.
---
&gt;There's definitely nothing in the game that allows anyone to simply facetank the raidbosses. That'd be mechanically dumb, and, in my opinion, quite boring.
---
It shifts the pressure from you to your supporters. They can compensate some errors, but at some point they'll run out of mana and team wipes. In bad teams you might run an extra healer because of such errors - in good teams you don't. Speedfarmers will run fast and efficient to improve reward/time ratio. To some degree has this worked in GW2 with dungeons. Experienced players spend like 10 min for a path in AC COE etc. Beginners like 1-1,5h. Gold per hour is for the experienced players by far better.
---
(this ignores the frustration many casuals experienced in dungeons because of one-hit mechanics). As example in SOE you rush trough the first room and pull the different groups + miniboss at the same time. Beginners would pull each group seperatly - and it takes them more time to kill a single group, than experienced players need for all enemies+boss combined.

---
Downvote but cause fuck you, mental upvote for metal.
---
By my reckoning there's not even that much new in the gem store by comparison. A single new mount skin which you can buy outright or take a shot for in the black lion chest.  
---
The complete living world 4 Season pack which everyone should have expected, it's not really new, so much as giving the ability of people to buy the whole story as a package.
---
And a single long bow, though admittedly a pretty nice one.
---
The rest of it are just basic changes to the black lion chest, including change for the new bow and mount and a glider pack that has been  in there already since the last month. Oh and some changes to what you can get with your tokens, also nothing new.
---
Are we really saying a new zone/story with all the events included and all the achievements is not more than a single bow and a new mount skin? 
---
Sure it takes longer to describe the specifics of how something you BUY WITH MONEY changes. You'd think that detail would have to be given, because you're spending money on it.
---
The zone itself is something you EXPLORE and learn about as part of the game. 
---
The meme is pretty funny, but you know, it's not really rooted in reality...at least not this time.

Hey, Dhuum has no breakbar and he's the hardest boss of the game therefore breakbars aren't important
---
EU: evening time. But in my experience, anytime if you tag up and put a squad in LFG. Takes a bit to fill up but then you can just keep going for hours. 🤷
---
Before beginning my remarks regarding the **Spirit Shard** deal and consequently the whole **Legendary** business \[**TP**\] members like MM, Xushin and the others are running on such a large scale, here's several key factors (, ):
---
\-  What they are in nature?
---
They're economists in nature, and economists **DISREGARD all social/morale implications**. Much like real life economists, they're all about **GDP (Gross Domestic Products)** of the game's community overall, hence why in **WP**'s video, they stated that they want to help boost the number of **middle class** wealth players.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
\- Why **price fixing** is a big issue if **a monopoly exists in GW2?**
---
Human beings make purchases on **emotional reasoning** in which they think is **rational**. Should \[**TP**\] win the race in both NA and EU, we would be expecting item prices to fluctuate according to their purchasing power. This gives them a very high leverage to profit on **TP Flipping** over any average trader.
---
Also note monopolies has historically been proven to lead to potential scenarios (Abiding the law of **Supply vs Demand**) where there's too many people wanting to use their service but there's no other alternative/competition to rival their price offerings, so their clients would eventually get diminishing return offers.
---
\- What's the deal with people's skepticism about investments, mega-projects like theses and economists in general these days?
---
Always **fully understand** a deal/investment before venturing into it, regardless if it's **Real Life** OR **Video Game**. Know what you're getting into before completely regretting your decision in the future if your invested money (In this case **Gold**) is put to use in ways **YOU** **principally** do not agree with **OR** are not **FUNDAMENTALLY**  fit to continue investing in it.
---
Being **skeptical** over something is actually healthy, provided it's backed by reasonable research and **NOT** fueled by purely emotions.
---
Now for my two-cents on this topic at hand:
---
I) The Gold Per Hour of each **Gift of Mastery Sold**
---
\- \[*Recap*\] As mentioned by many, **MM**'s guild has been known to provide aid to those who want to sell their spirit shards and **ESPECIALLY** their **Gift of Masteries**. This, I can vouch 100%.
---
\- In fact, what **OP** has claimed is **true** if judged on an **average/mean** scale. Folks that have claimed that the **Gold Per Hour** is much higher than **OP**, some did \[**make valid points which will be partially repeated here**, but did not state what exactly is happening *behind the scenes*\], while some were \[basically claiming that **those below the stated Gold Per Hour** were doing it **wrong**\]. I'd like to attempt to correct that.
---
1. \[**Gift of Battle**\] OP made a valid point, not everyone can afford boosters. This guide specifically requires players to at least **acquire** a decent amount of **laurels** to gain access to them. **OR** enough alternative characters to get the **level-up** boosters to exchange for **the boosters corresponding to WvW Reward Tracks**. ( [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Experience\_Booster](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Experience_Booster)) I would like to add-on that **MM** and his guild do **finance** a lot of **WvW** commanders from various servers, mainly those whom are not permanently in Tier 1 (**cough** looking at you **Blackgate**). &gt;!This means that if you are in liaison with a Gift of Mastery buyer from anyone in Guild \[TP\], you are immediately granted access to this service to fast-track your Gift of Battle via cough \[AFK\] WvW Participations. This is by means not supported by ArenaNet. Note: ArenaNet does not endorse AFKing in WvW, in fact they will ban if found. \[TP\]'s WvW services, despite them did not blatantly stated it, strongly encourages this behaviour. How it works is, their commanders would give you shared participation. All you have to do is simply be in any WvW map and do WHATEVER you want, in this case, AFK-ing is favoured by many typically.!&lt;
---
2. \[**Gift of Exploration**\] Open-textbook answer here. Many use **TacO** to fast-forward this section. Though with practice, you can nail down the man-hours on this track to about **18 to 20 hours**. &gt;!Hint: Some heart vendor NPCs require quest items that are surprisingly NOT Account Bound, so they usually skip those hearts by mass-buying said items from the Black Lion Trading Post.!&lt;
---
3. \[**Dungeon Tokens**\] Unless you have a party/group of in-house/friends whom can reliable do **skips** on dungeons (Some of the more notoriously known ones like **Ascalonian Catacombs/Gates of Arah/Citadel of Flame/Sorrow's Embrace/Caudecus Manor/Twilight Arbor)**, don't expect any *trim-downs* to the duration stated by the **OP**.
---
II) Who Profits More and Who Would Lose Out More?
---
\- This is a perfect replica of what a real-world corporation would be.
---
\- The **Gold per Hour** is basically:
---
1. **Capped for Gift of Mastery Sellers.**
---
2. **Uncapped for the corresponding buyers**. The more **Gift of Mastery sellers** or **Spirit Shard Converters.**, the higher their profit gains. They are only **capped** by the number of clients they have at a point of time.
---
Citing some video examples that fit the description of what **MM and his guild** are trying to do. If you're the kind whom are extremely skeptical by any video uploaded on You-tube, that is your choice, you can simply opt out from watching any of them. Personally, I find this specific youtuber's explanation very precise + he's very blunt about how the economy works:
---
 \- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1ytlteHDvA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1ytlteHDvA)
---
(Lowering Taxes, in this case **avoiding** taxes entirely for the **upper class**, in this case the **1%** of the richest players) 
---

---
\-  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8xcFGzWNjI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8xcFGzWNjI) 
---
(**Lobbying**, sounds familiar with what's happening in the WP video above?)
---
Part 2 of Trickle Down Economy
---
\-  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNYQl0hlyk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUNYQl0hlyk)
---
(3-part video, this is the **3rd part**, take it metaphorically in a sense that, those **mass-produced ships = our game's legendary market** and **Imperium = MM's \[TP\] guild**)
---
Note: Video links posted by u/HeroismGaming in his comments have been known by many whom... &gt;!have joined Xushin's lectures in Domain of Istan and currently his LWS4 train from the month of mid-February to April!&lt;. Also I'd highly advise to not take my **video highlight sentences word-for-word** and ultimately **skip the videos,** because the video has far more points than what I stated in the "**(...)**" highlights.
---
III) So does that mean Guild \[**TP**\] is fundamentally **EVIL**?
---
\- **Yes** and **no**. Remember: **Guild MM** and his associates have been funding **WvW** commanders to lead. As appalling as this may sound to some, he is partially **responsible** to keeping the lower tier servers **alive**. **WvW** has long been known as a **dying** game mode (**probably** until the foreseeable future with the announced **WvW** factions rework)
---
\- **Guild MM** himself has also been known to kick start/fund **guilds** in game modes such as **Raids**.
---
**IF** I were to put them on a **Dungeons and Dragons** alignment scale, they are **True Neutral** at best.
---
Yes! I want this and better music. Like Eye Of The North.

Is your CPU the i7-9800X?  What speed is your RAM?  Is your SSD an NVME?
---
I usually don't do this, as a player of 6 years now, but i did have 4 GoE just sitting in my bank for years, i had no interest in making any of the Gen 1 legendaries and i just made the Bow and the next project on the line was the Gen 2 GS. So i sold my GoM for 500 each since i had a lot of resources around from just playing the game.
---
For me that was easy 2k gold, it wasn't fast (mostly the clover part is not fun at all) but its nice if you can do this at your own pace without sacrificing much.
---
There's plenty of people out there who don't need to farm obby shards, karma, spirit shards, or do map completion. Plenty of people have those things in excess and what's being offered is a fairly easy way to earn 500g in a week. 
---
GW2Efficiency shows that the average person has 
---
Everybody | 0-500h  | 500-1000h | 1000-2000h | 2000-4000h | 4000h+
---
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
---
102 g 28 s | 33 g 51 s | 84 g 89 s | 116 g 16 s | 170 g 15 s | 314 g 99
---
So 500g is likely to be more gold than a randomly selected GW2 player has ever had at one time (not including the liquid gold value of things in storage). Before there's a bunch of "that's nothing! I have _____ gold sitting around!" this subreddit likely has a selection bias towards players who have more in terms of networth, including the amount of gold sitting in their account. GW2Efficiency might (but we can't know for sure) actually be a decent proxy of the actual no-bullshit amount of gold the average GW2 player has. I'd certainly be willing to bet most people have never had 500g sitting around (not counting the value of materials in the bank).
---
Ohhh. That looks tolerable.
---
Right?
---
PSA - you don't know how to post only one comment.
---

---
&gt; Shade abilities only affect the area around you while you do not have a shade active in the world.

---
the point was to show that in one pull, it is easily clearable, so its to:
---
a: anet to try to make it harder (legit, i didnt move and got hit by one attack which was side steppable)
---
b: the players to stop any potential complaining about steep dificulty

c: why not

wait wat. this exist?! fuck yeah

---
need to see Logan Thackeray cosplayers don the big hat
---
Reminds me of Detroit Metal City.
---
W5 sucks, only redeeming part is SH ^^
---
Again, because **GW2 should not be a Capitalism Simulator.** Everything about it is marketed as an action/adventure RPG game. It's supposed to be about killing elder dragons, not about killing it on the stock market. If someone wanted to make that game, great, let someone make it, but it should not be a central part of *this* one.
---
"Beep-boop I am here to take you to my home planet, human."
---
So I implore you as a mental exercise to figure out why people who find learning mechanics to be frustrating and hard are not going to bother doing it.
---
REEE featuring; none of the good REEE players.

World first at what?  Finishing it that quickly?

More room to note the excruciatingly detailed drawing of bugs by Gorrik.

Hey, wait a minute, but if you jump... doesn't that mean you're mid-air...?
---
Yet more evidence that they need to unify the three armor types.
---
Until all are one.

DS works the same way it has pretty much always worked. You need to check LFG and join between around 10 minutes before map reset and 20 minutes after map reset.

You've made a fatal assumption: REEE has good players
---
Press the key bound to Mount Ability 1
---
: not ; &lt;3
---
Don't think so this map
---
Ds map gets full, at least one, and you get added to a new shard with less people.
---
Get there a bit early, and help forming up squads and you should have no problem
---
are you femdom waifu master yet grim
---
.... The fuck. They should never drop something like that as loot....
---
ye its illegal
---
i mean... okay?
---
who even cares if you guys get the first ice man kill, you guys didnt even get the first frosty which was a way harder boss back in my day
---
also this comm isnt even good enough to play the dragon class its just pain ful to watch
---
ye we omega bad. we jsut got v lucky on the sammy record
---
That wasn't the point of this at all Lio.
---
The point of it was it was fun to do one 10man pull
---
\&gt;:(
---
please check your grammar my dude, I don't understand what you wanted to say
---
They cut that off from that ghost armor outfit (I forgot exactly what it's called)
---
Unrelated but TIL some people spell it "prolog".
---
I absolutely hate the very concept of battle pass.
---
To me, the best way to do things would be to keep the current black lion chest, but add a way to buy exclusive item from the store without the gambling aspect. Make it more expensive like mount select license, or make them lootbox exclusive form a limited time only before adding the ablity to buy the shinies straight off.
---
Oh my, time to dig out that old stabilizer soon it seems. I hope.
---
If you picked up on some of the stuff going on with and around Gorrik...
---
Well, let's just say we shouldn't forget his origins.
---
&gt; I know, and this claim is still as wrong as it has ever been

Yeah did that way back in the day in a gvg. Had a good chuckle.
---
It's been a problem since the beginning, I've mentioned this a few times but it's really low priority for majority of the players funnily enough, despite the game being heavily story-driven.
---
The cutscene effects volume shares the same slider as the ingame effects slider, so you need to turn it up, usually higher than others, to have a good cinematic experience, but that will make your combat skills have deafening volume.
---
I'm not into metal but I love this update, I love the theme, I love this art piece
---
&gt; It used to be the ~~citadel~~ [Cathedral](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Cathedral_of_Flames)* of flame in GW1
---
FIFY ;)
---
Ofc bruh!
---
Ideally I'd like a nice, open map with small pockets of challenging content - say in caves, forts or mini-dungeon like areas (somewhat like some jumping puzzles could be), but that's likely completely different to what you want.
---
I can't say I enjoyed Tangled Depths much on release - I only ever felt a want to go back after I started unlocking mounts, which made getting around much less stressful, but quite a few of my friends seemed to love it. I hope they can find a way to please both of us without some sort of unsatisfying compromise.
---
&gt; It is true that every update of game is like for one hour of play and You need wait for this update like 3-4 months? 
---
First part isn't *entirely* true, second part is. "Content" has a different meaning for everyone. Like I consider content to be endgame stuff like raids/WvW/fractals. So with that, yes, I mostly blow through the story/lore/achievements whenever it's mandatory to do because they just don't interest me. So I had gotten done with most of the past few updates fairly quickly. 
---
*That being said*, people who like doing the aforementioned things tend to take their time because they enjoy it. So the content, **to them**, doesn't last for an hour or two. They can extend their playtime over a few days or weeks.
---
Still my most wanted weapon of all because... I love to use the Focus .\_.
---
Not whining or anything but did they partner with SteelSeries to give a single headset LOL
---
Scourge is not meta for DPS. Is meta for the utilities he bring.
---
It's "meta" only on desmina, and is there for just 1 thing: Epidemic to fast kill the adds.
---
Contact customer support before they suspend your game account and inform them on situation. This is probably due to digital river suspecting fraud (multiple payment attempts from you in short time). Reddit can't help you with this.
---
I would get into contact with the Support ASAP and sort this out with them. You wouldn't want to still get the refund but also get your account banned because the system thinks you used that to get "free" gems.
---
Thanks :)
---
**WEIGHTED**

This game doesn’t run well unless you have the dx 12 mod and definitely need character limit to low/lowest and maybe shadows off. This games engine is poorly optimized and outdated.
---
Finally I can cosplay a crystal sage!
---
Turn off reflections, they are barely noticeable but eats a lot and set character model limit and quality on low and medium. Also set frame limiter to 60.
---
DPI scaling and UI on other than normal may cause the issue as well.
---
Things changed. Nowadays, you can get pretty much any stat combo available to your account as long as you can select stats on an ascended item. There are some exceptions (Ascended weapons from Elite Specs collections and stuff like that), but ascended gear from vendor should have all stats.

---
Non constructive criticism is bad, but non constructive praising is good. 5Head logic right there.
---
Stop being so toxic with your common sense. ^^^^/s
---
You are not correct but also not wrong either.
---
In WoW it is always to get to that next level to get better gear to do that dungeon/raid to get better gear until you reach it and then, well, have to wait for the next stuff to release which is mostly the next expansion.
---
In GW2, since you are pretty much end game ready when you reach level 80, you have to look for something that interests you yourself. GW2 is, as you might already know, about horizontal progression by not increasing levels or adding more and more and better armour to the game. There are masteries, Story, Achievements, Raids, Fractals, PvP, WvW, Fashion Wars and a lot more stuff that you can do, you just have to find something that is interesting for you.
---
And that brings me to the "content drought". They are everywhere depending on your situation. If you keep up with the game and complete everything in a matter of days or weeks then of course you will run out of things to do very quickly and you have to wait for the next update. Lets say you only play the story. While I have not completed the Prologue yet that released on Tuesday the episodes before that where around 1.5-2 hours long when you only played the story.
---
Of course you would think that the whole happy meal only tastes like fries when you only eat the fries, right?!
---
The thing is, pumping out content will always take more time than you can spent in it if you only concentrate on parts of it. The game offers you a lot of stuff you can do and a lot of hours you can spent in it but you have to find something that interests you and do that.
---
Be that by joining a Music guild and learn to play instruments, Leading battles in WvW to get to WvW Rank 10000, honing your skills in PvP and getting to legendary division, Joining Automated Tournaments or even getting ready for Raids. You have a lot of things you can choose from.
---
Let me make another example, if you play Elders Scroll Skyrim you can complete the main storyline in around 30 hours. That is not much. However, people spend thousand of hours in the game by completing sidequests and other things so they looked for activities they wanted to spent time.
---
What I want to say with all of that is that GW2 will not tell you what you should do and you have to look and decide what you want to do yourself. If you only play parts of the game then be sure that you will be hit harder by the "content drought" than someone who plays a bit of everything.
---
Yet, we don't know how their release cycle is with the Icebrood Saga. Season 3 and 4 kept in majority between 2-3 months and only this year because of a few issues (delays, lay-offs) it took them longer to release. They hinted at a faster release cycle with the Upcoming releases but you can bet on it that while they are more frequent not in the same size as we had the episodes before. How that will look like in the end we have to see. 
---
However, since there is not really something for you to fear to being "left behind" or getting irrelevant by not playing you can also just login each day, collect your daily and then play a different game.
---
That's kinda correct if you assume you have to spend 68 hours.
---
The point is that for a lot of people is not a correct assumption. Cause you obtain most of these things just by playing for something else. For example im sitting at about 10M karma, about 7000 spirit shards, 6 gift of battles.
---
So basically in my case the time required is just the one needed to do map completion, and im able to do it in like 25 hours. One map completion is 2 gifts, assuming to sell them at 500g each is 40g/hour that is good.
---
All of this to say that depending on what YOU have it can be one of the most profiting things to do.
---
Get 5 more eles and revs in enemy group and suddenly your scourges are dead.
---
&gt; Probably pretty good given that the lowest rung in American society is still among the top 5% wealthiest people in the world.

hahahahahaha excuse me w h a t
---
If you new to gw2 you will have at lest 4k hours of gamplay untill you start to fill empty and see the drought. 
---
The new content is releases every \~4 months, and its quite short (the main 'quest' in it: 2-3hours), but there is a new map and ton of achieviements and activites you can do afterwards. Also new items that you can look forward to (like legendary trinkests that takes some commitment to make. 
---
For PvP its quite... um... the meta is strong, and there is only a quaterly balance patch (that usualy does not take focus on what is the main issue, but you are probably used to that as you come from WoW).
---
&gt; If you new to gw2 you will have at lest 4k hours of gamplay untill you start to fill empty and see the drought. 
---
You can easily go through all the story, do all the meta events, do fractal 1-100 cm and raids and get bored of it within 2k hours, that's about how long it took for several of my friends to quit the game.
---
Its up to you to determin the value of your spirit shards vs how much they value them its called bartering. If you dont like that they make a bigger profit make your own legendaries and sell them then you get 100% of it.

Literally just list them, it's not hard. Do not filibuster with this "oh you would never agree". Make your actual case.
---
When the "Hype the Crowd" event starts youwill get a special action key (the icon will be a kind of fist on an orange background). What you need to do is go in front of some of the NPC spectators that don't look hype for the moment (or maybe even already hyped NPCs work) and presse the action key. You will see a kind of white cone in front of you and all the NPC inside it will start to cheer (2 hars in the air with the fists closed).
---
FYI, Scales perfect on Charr :)
---
The worst part is it makes condi scourge in pve worse, and healer scourge better. I do it all so I look at all parts but yea, it also pretty much limits scourge to power bomb, nerfing condi scourge in wvw too
---
&gt; The strike mission is avialable since less than two days, your "in general" is "this very specific moment".
---
No, because my comment wasn't a) talking about only strike missions, it's actually talking about how people approach content in general, and b) wasn't drawing from data or experiences with the strike. That's why my comment was future tense.
---
perhaps because game companies are notorious for underpaying, well, just about everyone?

Hope we can get it some other way too. :)
---
The game is super casual at the beginning, you won't get challenging content until later and even then most of it is considered casual by people who are veterans to MMOs.
---
To use any mount movement ability (blink, hover, long jump, high jump, dive, etc) use your dodge key (V by default)
---
Except I did clearly stated exactly what I found to be good. Asking "why" and "how" with every comment can turn everything into an epistemological mess.
---
No point in replying to people that rationalise things in this manner. They have a pre-made opinion that cannot be changed, even if you could prove the most basic premises to them in lavish detail. But I suppose we should revel in our addictive negativity for the coming months to come instead of praising what they did well for once.

It's not getting old.  That's how business works.

Mainly because you can build for 7k+ autoattacks without buffs from other players.

For the oneshot build people may just change to the axe mainhand, as axe 3 can do 25k+ solo.

This changes nothing in WvW, while deleting Scourge from sPvP.

These proposed changes need to be revamped.

The outfist are cute as hell and the mounts look amazing. Youre right about the guild thing, already had the pleasure of meeting a few cool people.
---
How often do your shades pulse damage compared to you placing another shade?
---
Support scourge was already beyond busted in pve and even with this change, you can still place shades on top of the group.
---
Thank you. That was the missing piece for me understanding the mechanic. I don't care how (not) difficlut the boss is but I really don't like badly explained/showed mechanics ...
---
No, you have to get 100% map complete if you want a core legendary weapon, which has the exact same stats as ascended weapons, which only have slightly higher stats than exotic weapons which are easy to get at 80. 
---
Furthermore, the world is faster to complete when you're at 80 than it is at level anyway. And hearts DO fill in whether you do them or not, if you're doing the events in the area. This game is a very different animal than most games, and should be approached differently, if you want to enjoy it. 
---
It's not all hello kitty adventureland. Most of the hearts aren't that anyway.
---
Again, if you're finding the content too easy, move to a higher level. You can go 7 levels above you and still survive. Challenge yourself.
---
&gt; They decided to turn hearts into events. BEST DECISION EVER. 
---
Hard disagree here. It's probably the worst decision to me.
---
Yeah, sure, it's good to have *some* of them as hearts. Gives the feeling we're finally playing an MMO again, where GW2 had turned a lot into "solo content with some sort of multiplayer on the side". But *ALL* hearts into events is too much. Why? Because as I progressed through the story, and reached that infamous part of "do all those events to get the next part so we can artificially elongate playtime", I found myself running around the map unable to do the activity I actually wanted and being forced to do certain events I did not find interesting (who in 2019 still likes escort missions seriously?). Not only that, but in-between events, I had to wait for some to reset to do them. So, ultimately, it's a downgrade to player freedom. Hearts, we can do them whenever we want, at the pace we want. Events? You can do them only when they spawn, otherwise you're just waiting, victim of an invisible timer.
---
A good balance would've been to have some of those events turned into hearts, and the rest as map events, that way, there would be enough choice to cater to all kinds of players, both completionists and casuals.
---
It's fine in endgame PvE, however the change overall is unneeded and misses what its intended to do; nerf Scourge in WvW.
---
I loved that.
---
Because all these rely on actual facts instead of wishful thinking? Please...
---
[Fact.][https://gw2efficiency.com/account/statistics/statistics.unstableCosmicEssences]
---
How is it that FOUR easier difficulties do not make people want to learn mechanics and on average only 1% of the playerbase in gw2efficiency has any measurable amount of cosmic essences?
---
And how will one brain-dead easy difficulty magically make them want to?
---
It won't. It's clear, it's obvious, it's backed by both common sense and actual facts.
---
&gt; Hey, bro, maybe you should turn off your selective blindness for thirty seconds and re-read the comment:
---
Wow, can you maybe turn it down a bit?
---
&gt; Stop cherry-picking what to respond to so you can be salty.
---
Criticism is not salt. I am not salty. Why would I even be salty? This content was clearly not aimed at me to begin with and I always knew that. I am analyzing it for its ability to do its job. You can't just brush any criticism of it aside as being salt.
---
&gt; The entire point of the comment you responded to was that this wasn't going to be the standard for every strike mission
---
But that doesn't defend *this strike mission* at all. If *this strike mission* doesn't meet the standards that other strike missions are I guess theoretically in the future going to meet, then surely that means *this strike mission* is a failure. Moreover, neither does it address my criticism of the concept as a whole.
---
&gt;  but was an introduction to strike missions with the expectation that future strikes will steadily increase in difficulty in different stages until they are equivocal to a minor raid boss, having built up confidence along the way.
---
That sounds an awful lot like fractals, maybe you need to "turn off your selective blindness for thirty seconds and re-read the comment" because I specifically addressed that very concept, including offering fractals themselves as an example.
---
&gt; It's posts like yours, in fact, that remind me of why I don't raid in this game, because people like you exist and you so badly look down on other players that you will find any excuse to diminish their attempts at trying to improve by shouting it down at the top of your lungs. "IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH" it's the first one, you absolute dolt, and the post you chose to shriek in response to hinged on this fact.
---
You've created an absolute fantasy in your mind of what I am because of a post where I did nothing but critique a system, and in a very mild mannered way as opposed to your characterization of a shrieking, demanding player. Can you please tone down the overt hostility?
---
Here is the reality: I've trained a lot of raiders. I've helped groups get off the ground and I help people do CMs that haven't done them before for no benefit to myself. The idea that I am a person who diminishes any attempts someone make to improve could not be further from the truth. I always have absolute respect for someone who tries. My criticism has nothing to do with that, it has to do with the system surrounding them and what those system encourage. I am specifically critiquing this system *because I want a better system for getting people into raiding*.
---
Like you seem to think my analysis of the humans (largely, not exclusively) approach this stuff is just me shitting on people for not being good at the game or something. It's not. I talked about it even being true of my own raid team, people I enjoy raiding with. It also includes ME. I can freely admit, for example, that I have no idea how the mines are formed or destroyed on the earth djinn boss in w7. I don't need to know in order to kill the boss, so I've not really worried about it.
---
&gt; "IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH" it's the first one, you absolute dolt, and the post you chose to shriek in response to hinged on this fact.
---
Well I guess calm critiques are not allowed because it's the first and we all know the best way to improve systems is to never critique them, and also anything that you personally disagree with is shrieking. Good to know. Now do you actually want to address any of my points regarding this particular strike and the concept at large as a way of teaching people, or would you rather just continue with the baseless personal attacks?
---
Even if people COULD stand at max range and receive all buffs/healing/etc it would still be inefficient. Every meta build that could get away with only using range weapons still have skills that are melee range or benefit from being in melee. 
---
Condi ranger has sb2, merged f3, traps. Staff weaver has stuff like fire staff 4, overloads, lh3, weave skills. Condi scourge has plaguelands, their torch skills aren't melee but are only 600 iirc? The only strictly range class that doesn't is rifle deadeye.
---
would have gilded if I could, cakeday too and everything
---
Heart of Thorns is a bit of a difficulty spike, PoF less so but I'd still say it's "harder" than Core Tyria. At least when you aren't running around in a zerg doing meta events.
---
I wouldn't rate the game in general high on the difficulty scale, though. The only time it gets close are some poorly designed and annoying boss fights.
---
They're right tho. :)
---
Where can i start this mini game?
---
Skyscale not worth 70g if you have the griffon is the better way of putting it.
---
Griffon can dive to touch down quickly, skyscale descends slowly and gets stuck on walls but also refuses to hover directly above the ground. Griffon has infinite flight range as long as you have enough altitude to dive, skyscale enforces its height limit relative to your *starting* position/the last time you touched solid ground while *also* losing height when travelling horizontally.
---
Skyscale is good for a quick double barrel roll where the raptor would faceplant into a cliff, can lift you vertically further than the springer can and looks cool while afk hovering, that's about it. If you're super tryhard the engage spawns a fire field and deals high damage but good luck aiming it.
---
No, it's far worse. Aoe size, cooldown management, less range.
---
Its permanant, buy PoF get HoT free.
---
That is their regular price now i think. When you buy Path of fire you also get heart of thornes
---
Probably start with [Fractals](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fractals_of_the_Mists), it's 100 levels of difficulty with hard mode on a few of the last ones. You don't need the best gear for the first tier but probably wait until level 80. As for open world it's a fiesta the whole way through the basic game, some of the story bosses can pack a punch but nothing special.
---
There are also [dungeons](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dungeon), with the first one opening story mode at level 30, don't know how active the story mode is though compared to the explorable paths. Dungeons were abandoned dev side a few years ago though.
---
The Griff you could compare to a jet, while the Skyscale would be more comparable to a Helicopter. The Griff has the speed to match top speed Roller Beetle, but requires you to have enough height to build up that dive momentum. Skyscale doesn't have the speed of the Griff; but has precise movement, better at scaling structures, and has a nice small burst of speed when using your dodge roll/barrel roll endurance (which you can get more out of with the endurance refil mastery skill).
---
Contact support but don't panic. It's happened to me and numerous people before and usually your bank will sort it before you have to do anything anyway.
---
I don't know why it's started doing it for some people but it has.
---
Just to answer that question: Yes, you can fly endless with griffon if you don't use S to pull up but Mount Ability 1 and 2 (to find in your control options for keybinds). S is also the key to slow the griffon down / it's for landing. If you use the Mount Ability keybind instead, you will fly forward after pulling up. You can always gain back your start hight.
---
Thank you!
---
Right. Milhouse-territory then.
---
Anyways, I thought it meant "racism" as the topic of telling, leaving the bottom text detached. Adding "THAT" before the bottom text would make it much, much more readable.

I can imagine her being corrupted by Jormag at some point in the near future and she's just like *"how about no"* and carries on as usual.
---
ITT: 
---
I know all the exact ramifications of this patch and everyone who disagrees is evil and a casual who doesn't know wvw.
---
Yep
---
Honestly, the 'feeling like a downscaled core area' is kind of why I like it (at least insofar as how the zone is actually laid out); I don't think getting from point A to point B is where the difficulty should lie.
---
Now the actual events and everything in the zone are a little undertuned, I agree, but I'd much rather have a zone that's open and fun to get around than one stopping me every 3 seconds to fight a 'challenging' mob. Even the ones that're fun to fight get tiresome after the third, fourth, tenth time.
---
I'd rather the difficulty lie in events and optional areas a player could find than the map be littered with mobs that are just difficult enough to fight to be annoying. Trash enemies earned their name for a reason.
---
I can draw a comparison to another MMO here - I know it's not in the best state, even a very good state, but Battle for Azeroth saw fit to fill its dungeons to the absolute brim with trash enemies, and almost every one of them has some sort of interesting mechanic to be avoided or otherwise dealt with (by way of crowd control and the like). They're novel and even really fun to fight the first few times, but the problem is there's just so many of the damn things!
---
So tl;dr: I don't mind interesting, difficult combat at all - just don't fill the entire map to the brim with these sorts of encounters.
---
Its I hour if you whizz through it and never go back. But if you take the time to explore the map, do some events, replay for achievements and finish collections etc, you have loads of plsytime
---
&gt; I recommend you do them side by side, solo strike and solo fractal.
---
Maybe I should.
---
That's a shame. I haven't done much of the Strikes yet, but I was hoping they'd be able to provide some level of difficulty without the sometimes frustrating feeling of instadeath in higher-tier content. Something that provides a fair challenge without you having to be 100% alert at all times.
---
If people are literally tanking the mechanics, they need to find some sort of balance, otherwise why have mechanics at all?
---
The tag is the best investment I ever did in the game. It's basically a content unlock. Need that event? Pop the tag. Need that bounty? Pop the tag. Need that Strike Mission? Pop the tag. It's magic!
---
You lose some, of course, but you can always gain it back, even after flying close to the ground for a while :) that's what I wanted to explain.
---
&gt; This is true, if you dive below your starting height then you won't be getting that back, but the tradeoff is that you can climb about one Springer jump higher than you start, so you have a bit of a cushion there. You can also regain some altitude by using the mastery ability. 
---
This is a little deceptive since climbing eats into your horizontal range budget. I cannot state with 100% certainty that it's zero-gain but basically if you *don't* climb first you can fly horizontally and drain the green bar that way before needing to lose height gliding. You also cannot use the mastery without cliffs nearby while the griffon can stay up quite a while with flapping+vigor.
---
&gt; If you dive and raise frequently, you can extend the total distance, but at the expense of hassle and time wasted going up and down. 
---
You're omitting how much faster the griffon is after the dive, and you only need to pull up once you reach your ground clearance limit or approaching an elevated destination. 
---
&gt; Skyscales are not ideal for long distance travel from a high point, since they are slower, but if you do intend to travel from a high point, planning out a route in which you tap down every few hundred feet is not typically that hard to do, and will allow you to maintain a relatively stable altitude across the zone. 
---
Route planning takes advance knowledge and effort. If you have no *other* reason to touch down the griffon can just zoom all the way to your *actual* destination. If you have a lot of intermittent stops such as on a gathering run chances are you deal with a lot of solid ground where the raptor or jackal will be faster, or lots of cliffs which the springer can scale more quickly. There are a few edge cases such as traversing a dense walled town where rising above the wall and touching down on the rooftops is faster than jackal-porting the ground route but even then you probably could go springer-&gt;raptor instead.
---
Ultimately whenever I try to use the skyscale I just get **incredibly annoyed** at its supposedly "helpful" mechanics. Like clinging to trees when I just want to glide past because the hitbox extends at least 2 character widths beyond the visible models. Or clinging to a cliff and needing to wait for the release animation when I want to touch down on top of it. Or being stuck airborne for 2s because I wanted to do a quick jump but can't tell the damn thing to just *stop flying* for a moment. Or gliding off a bouncing mushroom launch and mounting midair only to discover that *SURPRISE!* my green bar is empty and I'm dropping because my "target" height is still fixed to the position of the mushroom. And while cheesing terrain designed around the springer is convenient I can rest assured they will never add any obstacles which *require* the skyscale without having obvious loaner roosts nearby.
---
I hope they can find a satisfying balance between open exploration and difficulty - and I think it's very possible to do so by tying the difficulty to things like events, and having the base zone just be a 'place'. But it remains to be seen which direction they'll want to go in.
---
If the majority of zones were fun to explore *and* had avenues of difficulty I could seek out, that'd be perfect. I haven't really been able to get into areas post-HoT because it feels like I have to be on my toes at all times, no matter what.
---
I understand that some people are really into that constant feeling of danger though, so I wouldn't blame them if they continued in that direction going forward. Just, this zone reminds me of what got me into the game to begin with - the sense of exploration is still something no other MMO has captured.
---
As far as I'm aware, the Strike Mission has really meh rewards. I doubt you'll find much people to do it in like 2 months...
---
Having both, I find myself using the skyscale more often for purely practical purposes, but enjoying the griffon more for the pure fun of flying it.
---
Out simply, the skyscale is probably the single mount that gives you the most range, in the sense that there's almost nothing you can't reach with it. If you can reach it with any other mount (except the jackal in the case of a completely enclosed room with a portal), then you can reach it with the skyscale.
---
However, the griffon is pure fun. It takes skill to fly one properly, and I am super-proud of myself whenever I manage a difficult griffon maneuver.
---
I would be totally fine with just map segments. It makes sense that some areas would be completely inundated with the enemy, if we're fighting an  army of dragon minions for example.
---
It just gets tiring when it starts to feel like almost every step you take involves some sort of combat.
---
Yep, if there is a group event I need (for collections or whatever) and can't do alone, I just tag up, wait a bit and "gathered" enough people to do the event. :)
---
On the other hand, when I have nothing to do and see a tag on the map, I go to him and check what he is doing. :P
---
Honestly the only boss where this might be annoying is sh. What other boss moves around that much that you can't prepare for it?
---
Rammstein vibes from that event
---
Necros already can hit 10 targets at once.  This just makes them choose range or close by..
---
More people will be corrupted even though each player is corrupted 1 less boon. For example 5 scourge corrupting total 75 boons is current scenario, with patch, it'll be 5 scourge corrpting 100 boons from the enemy zerg.
---
how so?  wells will still have 5 person cap.. shades do not boon corrupt.
---
Now if only Longbow had a use
---
&gt; Any mechanic that enables you to actually learn needs to be punishing enough to make you focus on it.
---
Let's look at the exact opposite, rewards. 
---
As I said, too much punishing is just frustrating for many players and lower the willing to learn. So what do you think about rewards? In the story we often have achievements where we have to avoid certain attacks for the whole fight. 
---
I think those achievements could be a great motivation to learn mechanics, without punishing too much. "Avoid attack X/Y/Z 5/10/25 times" as one time achievements and maybe "Avoid attack X/Y/Z for the whole fight" as unlimited achievements that grants a little bit extra loot. I think that would be enough to motivate "lazy" players to learn the mechanics.
---
In the end learning through rewards is more effective than learning through punishment.
---
You should get it as long as you are roughly inside the concert area where other events happen. It's possible that this event started at the same time as several others as it sometimes happens, you were focused on the others and missed it.
---
I dont get it. Why the hack are you comparing yourself with hardcore players everytime? You dont even know what hardcoreplayers are, do you? Sounds like you just want to live the faceroll philosophy that you set upt for yourself. Thats fine and all but then dont try to put the blame on anet if they release content that is 10% more difficult then faceroll open world. 
---
I just love reading comments like this hating on "hardcoreplayers" without having tried raiding/ more difficult content in a serious way.
---
tldr: You mad cause you bad
---
Yes. A good example someone made was the snowman boss from the last winter festival.
---
It actually was a decent difficulty, had reasonably clear mechanics, and a little mini raid/dungeon leading up to it. The format was basically the same as with the strike in this map, but was a better execution of the idea.
---
I just get kicked off the stage and that's it. Huh.
---
...which then requires a huge amount of effort compared to "just" ascended. As it should.
---
Your answer is not wrong, though.
---
One of the few games, where the german voice acting blew the english one out of the water. Will also forever be remembered for the stuff you could read (and find) in graveyards.
---
Nefarious Favor corrupts 1 boon by default. With Path of Corruption traited it's 3 boons total.
---
Wells are just a bonus.
---
They said that the first Strike Mission will evolve with ep1 and 2. And if you like spoilers, you could take a look at [That Shaman's twitter post](https://twitter.com/that_shaman/status/1174271146386251777). It shows the full model of the Ice Construct.
---
Tell me if I am wrong here but... Isn't there enough "casual" content in this game already? All of the open world content, T1 fractals and story dungeons are mega casual. Compare this to the amount of raiding content in the game.
---
I didn't say that this encounter needs to be as hard as a raid. Because thats not the point of it. What I did say is, that it's not really good as training content. And this was the reason why Arena Net build strike missions in the first place. To train people for raiding.
---
So if you don't like this, then strikes are also not really for you. Because in order to train someone for raids, not willing to dodge or run useless builds should be punished by the encounter. Otherwise it's not a training mode for raids. And no, it's also not meant to be an instanced open world gank boss. (At least if you listen to the dev's themselves and what they say about strike missions)
---
I knew something like this would happen so I just hit the default button before I started playing the story.
---
Yeah, when they said that strike missions will evolve, I heard that like "the next ones will have more mechanics, be a little harder" not like "old ones will evolve"
---
That would make sense if all of these were not on instanced content. What good does it do to sandswept the fact that you have to run through cabbages in a story instance when you are, for all purposes, not actually in the map with other players when you come back for the achievement?
---
 Miscellaneous effect.png Boons Converted to Conditions while Scourge: 1
---
It's not 1:1 though. You can't just "gain it all back," even if that can be hard to tell given how far you can fly. 
---
Basically, if you start high and just glide, then you will lose, say, 5ft of height per second. If you start at 200ft, you'd hit the ground in 40 seconds (these are not accurate figures, but are for the example). If you flap, you can gain 5ft every five seconds, so that would give you around 100 seconds of flight time. If you dive instantly to near the ground, you get a speed boost, but will still continue falling by 5ft per second. If you fly low for 30 seconds, and then raise up as high as you can go, then even if you do it perfectly, you will not get back up to 200ft, you will level off at maybe 150ft or so. Probably less than that. It will be high compared to where you just were, but not compared to where you started out. 
---
Now, if you *constantly* dive and raise, with only a few seconds spent flat, then you can gain about as much altitude as you lose, even gain a little more if you time it all just right, but every second spent flying flat, you're *permanently* losing *some* maximum altitude.

this is some "purity of purpose" level of bullshit, I still don't know where they are going with all these engineer changes that are sucking the fun out of every build I used to enjoy...

Yup, anyone saying "GW2 doesn't have generic 'kill 50 boars' MMO side-quests" is pretty delusional. The achievement window is where you'll find them. Except instead of getting a reward when you've completed each one, you'll get one reward when you've done 15-40 of them.

Also unclear whether he was sent BACK in time when in FoR, as he knows US by this point ('no you said 97') however he does not recognize the rift stabilizer. Also he implies he is in FoR with a purpose ('Im investigating strange stuff here') not just ported there randomly.
---
That's not entirely true. While there are pure raw damage scourges, there are also griever/celestial stat ones. This iteration favours the 2nd one mostly, more condition damage, more sustain, more corrupts. Marauder/Berserker scourge is indeed in a worse situation but people will still run them since total damage they can deal in an 15 second burst is far more than others. Only squishy elementalists can pass that if played right. To be honest, even if damage nerfs were %30 instead of %20, scourge will still be in the king and queen situation along firebrands just because of the corrupts.  
---
In my honest opinion, a nerf should be a nuke to current system; "corrupted boons can not tick more than 1 second" this would bring them to useful but still not good damage tier.
---
\#BANGARDIDNOTHINGWRONG ?
---
Yeah, plus the story isn't straightforward as usual.

I thought that Jormag would just come and crash the party, instead it took a different turns of events which kinda surprised me.

I'm betting on that.  Already talking with the "boys" .. about a balls deep tactic.. just don't even drop F1 shade.. stealth up.. push in.. drop load.. go from there.  Depending on how bad the damage loss is with spiteful spirit over closer to death is whether we determine the extra boon corrupt is worth it or not..

As an introduction to raid mechanics I would like that if you fail a certain boss mechanic (for example a green circle) the boss gets a (large) breakbar which greatly reduces the damage the boss takes (or increases the damage of the boss for a certain amount of time). In this case if you fail the mechanic you have to break the bar to recover and don't get the frustrating wipe-experience. So if you decide to ignore the mechanic it makes the clear longer/ more difficult . If you ignore to many of the mechanics you should reach the enrage timer and in consequence do not succeed. But failing just some of the mechanics wouldn't make the encounter impossible or result in a wipe. A cool side effect is that it teaches the importance of breakbars.
---
I found it on a german news site who summarized the announcement.

https://www.buffed.de/Guild-Wars-2-Spiel-17072/News/Icebrood-Saga-Live-Stream-Uebersicht-1330532/
---
&gt; Erste Strike-Mission lässt Spieler gegen Eisbrut-Konstrukt kämpfen, das seine Form zwischen Episode 1 und 2 ändern wird.
---
"First Strike-Mission let players fight against Icebrood-Construct, that will change his form between Episode 1 and 2." 
---
Well, either they mixed something up and acutally meant "between prologue and episode 1" (earlier they didn't mix it up) or there will be two changes, between prologue and EP1 and between EP1 an 2.
---
Uh, what?
---
But regaining height via multiple dive cycles is a huge pain in the ass. Easier to just climb a nearby wall with a Skyscale.
---
legendary armor is your answer
---
I think it is a bug. I have all types if sounds turned to a value that is hearable but the punches were silent for me.
---
If players won’t spend 30 learning a rotation for challenging content with good rewards (T4s, raids) then they won’t bother with a rotation at all for something which is easier than a world boss but with worse loot
---
Sandswept Isles is a bit like that, I suppose. I’ve always liked that map when I’m not in the mood for the intensity of some of the others.
---
&gt;The only thing they are focusing on is short term gain, nothing long term. If the game didn't bring in enough revenue a month or two I think they wouldn't give a single crap to just shut it down.
---
and whats exactly your basis for this? Did they shut down gw1 after it stopped returning enough revenue? and lets be clear the average quarterly amount gw2 does outside of expansions period is what gw1 made when it actually released an expansion. between 2010 and 2012 (last reported income for gw1) it made on average $2m per quarter, thats 9x less what gw2 does per quarter yet. Last reported quarter for gw1 was $1.1M  and yet they still keep it running. Yet you think if it makes anything less than what it does now they're going to close it? 
---
&gt;I mean at least be honest with yourself and the player base,every thing they promised is either postponed until never or gets a very mediocre not finished release that stays buggy and bad for the rest of its life.
---
Sure lets see. 
---
2013 in a blog post titled: Colin Johanson on Guild Wars 2 in the Months Ahead Anet promised:
---
One of our focuses is expanding and leveraging our achievement system. -&gt; they did
---
We’ll continue to offer cosmetic rewards such as titles, medals (such as map completion), unique skins, etc., which will remain prizes earned for completing specific parts of the game. -&gt; they did
---
You won’t see another tier between Ascended and Legendary -&gt; they did
---
To that end, we’re working on adding new types of content to the game in early 2013 that will allow guilds to go on missions together -&gt; eventually abandonded but they did deliver on their promise for a time
---
Firstly, we’ll be adding paid server transfers, with time limitations and WvW restrictions, and guesting ability -&gt; they did
---
Second, we’ll make improvements to culling -&gt; check
---
We’ll introduce a system of prestige and advancement specifically designed for WvW. -&gt; check
---
we’ll be evaluating our PvP reward systems and overhauling the way PvP operates to make it feel more rewarding and exciting and to give you reasons to log in and compete every day.  -&gt; yep
---
hings like being able to watch other competitors -&gt; yep
---
Leaderboards on our website where you can compare your abilities with other players to find out who is the best in the world. -&gt; yep
---
well pretty much everything promised there was deliver, but what about this very latest "whats next?"
---
released april 2019, titled What’s Next for Guild Wars 2
---
So, what’s next? We released Super Adventure Festival so players can return to Moto’s game world and experience the homage to the games of yesteryear. -&gt; yep
---
After that, the Current Activities Team has a release that will build toward the Season 4 finale. -&gt; done
---
We’re currently adding more polish to the final encounter in the next raid, which continues the story of Qadim -&gt; yep
---
legendary runes and sigils -&gt; delivered
---
the long-requested feature of build templates is in the works. -&gt; not here yet
---
we’d like to increase the max cooking level from 400 to 500.  -&gt; done
---
 how important world restructuring is to our WvW initiatives, and that hasn’t changed. -&gt; not here yet
---
Swiss tournament support  -&gt; nope
---
I think I am not the one who has to be honest with myself and the playerbase here cause what you said "every thing they promised is either postponed until never or gets a very mediocre not finished release" is definitely false.
---
&gt;PvP &amp; WvWvW haven't seen a decent quality of life update since probably the fucking start of the game and if you wanna tell me "but they got a mount" then for the love of god I hope you are kidding.
---
Do I need to list all the maps released since launch? yes things have defintiely stagnated there in the last couple of years no saying they didnt but since launch? please
---
&gt;asset flipping non stop
---
what are you even talking about? this in my opinion the game that least asset flips ever! for this release they reused 1 tree and 1 plant model... a tree and a plant and people have been pointing out everywhere! a plant and a tree, that makes the news!
---
&gt;I mean every single map they bring out is either a ghost town after they nerfed a bug that caused the economy to crash YET again or the rewards aren't there in the first place.
---
which map is a ghost town exactly? Cause I pretty much play all of them and no matter what hour I log in I see people everywhere! are we even talking about the same game here?
---
&gt;getting people in the game only to be met with a system that is designed for max lvl
---
like?
---
&gt;Leveling is slow and boring after the first 30-40 levels
---
For crying out loud game has a linear leveling curve, level 30-31 requires 15 dynamic events, level 79-80 requires 15 dynamic events and thats assuming you get 0 xp from anywhere else. 2 Dungeon runs get you 1 1/2 levels. a story mission gives you 1/3 of  a level. And that not counting that by just logging in you get essentially 1/2 a level every day for free (you get 16 tomes of knowledge per month).. which game are you comparing to that faster exactly?
---
&gt; slow and boring after the first 30-40 levels because at that point you stop getting any fun rewards
---
wait are you saying leveling is slow because rewards are not "fun" ?
---
&gt;once at max level the game has so much useless content that they first have to power through to get to the "real grind".
---
what useless content are you talking and more importantly whats this "real grind" you're talking about?
---
&gt;That's also a thing, this oh so friendly community is a freaking loser hive mind. Anyone that doesn't agree with their vision is a troll and should just walk of a cliff and die. Its disgusting.
---
Seriously ? Are you sure the issue is not agreeing with them ? rather then the truckloads of hyperbole they're forced to eat over and over again and if they dare correct the record they get downvoted to obvion and accused of being a white knight?  
---
&gt;I am allowed to spread my disapprove of the game because I have earned it.
---
I never seen anyone say people arent allowed their opinion regardless what it is, I think you're missing the point, people have issues with intentional disinformation, hyperbole and unfair critistism. The issue isnt someone saying I dont know Anet promised a WvWvW overhaul that just never came, the issue is when that person says " every thing they promised is either postponed until never or gets a very mediocre not finished release that stays buggy and bad for the rest of its life"
---
I trust you get my point here!
---
I'm not hostile, and I don't have a problem with you disagreeing. I was just pointing out that your response only works because you purposefully ignored the multiple clarifications I made to put my comment in context.
---
The parts you skipped are completely relevant to your point. You have a problem with the concept of strike missions as a whole, as judged by this one - - the assumption being that this is basically how all of them are going to be, which means no one will learn anything useful for raids. My point (and the portions you skipped over) argue that you can't judge strike missions in general based on this mission alone.
---
In conclusion, you don't have to agree with my point, but maybe don't ignore portions of people's comments just because they are inconvenient for the point you wish to make.
---
Iirc the 4 of them "gifted" WP 4 legendaries.
---
Yes. It's capitalistic in nature. Won't call it "Free" Promotion. But definitely an "easy grab" on TP side / "raw deal" on WP side, with the advantage clearly going to \[**TP**\] long term.
---
I expect her in the future because she has a main story plot.
---
That last panel face is so on point.
---
&gt; Or the 500 crazed fans.
---
So what you're saying is that I have a good excuse to keep doing the Metal Legion event!?
---
&gt; Which utterly fails on the face of itself because this assumes the "Workers" can A) Afford the tools required for production
---
Whether they can or not basically a function of the system they exist in.
---
&gt; B) can manage everything themselves as a "collective" unit,
---
Why would you think they can't? Worker coops already exist and do fine. All sorts of other democratic processes are functional within society as a whole too.
---
&gt; C) Can meet any market demands through the virtue of their own "Prophetic ability" to see into the futures.
---
How exactly is this any different at all to what you think capitalists and entrepreneurs already do?
---
&gt;  D) Can have one centralized Unit price control Everything. Just for fun facts, did you know at The Peak Of the Soviet Union, the "Pricing Center" had to figure out the "Price" of 10,000 items/DAILY? 
---
Well that's far from the only way a socialist system could work.
---
&gt; Financial systems by their nature cannot be a permanent structure, they are predatory in design and puts the value of "Money" over the value of Human Life.
---
Yeah, maybe we need a system that puts social benefits ahead of mass scale profiteering, and focuses on building communities :p
---
Decentralizing or democratizing power while limiting the ability of individuals to continue profiteering beyond a certain point seems like it has a real chance of at least partially addressing these issues.
---
The problem is I understood that but couldn't interact with the torches in a way that allowed that to happen. couldn't initially light a torch at the fire, or run to someone's thrown fire because I would automatically drop the torch at certain points. It felt like the event broke
---
Can someone explain to a noob if he's actually just mashing everything on cooldown or if there's a system to his skill use?
---
I think it's mount ability (1? 2?) in the controls. I have set it to ALT.
---
Use it and show us how it looks!
---
I don't have 200-300g to spare for an icon. 
---
The rules for it seem to be:
---
If there is no tag but you call out in map chat, and link WP, some might show up.
---
If you pop an apple tag, there is a 50% chance people will show up, 50% chance they will ignore you. 
---
If you pop an apple tag on a meta (important) event, there is a VERY HIGH chance of an asshole coming over and popping up their commander tag over your apple (even for events which don't require squad coordination or huge groups). 
---
If there is a commander tag, people flock to it to see what's up. A lot of the time I'll rush over towards a Commander tag and be disappointed because they just pop their tag and aren't actually doing anything, just sitting there AFKing showing their commander tag, literally for no reason.
---
Isn't it scaling up or down?
---
I NEED SOME WATER!
---
CHOP THAT SUCKER UP GOOD!
---
[https://youtu.be/7Vr2g01z24E](https://youtu.be/7Vr2g01z24E)  
---
Focus and dagger are pretty interchangeable. I took focus here because stationary target and it was a little easier on the rotation with no channel lock skill to hold me in place sometimes.  
---
It was also fun when I took lots of damage while invulnerable.
---
Just to offer my perspective, as someone who never finished gw1: I never really got the sense that the Charr were a cuddly race, either. The first map in Ascalon, alone, made it kinda clear that something terrible happened for literal ghosts to be attacking them, and they definitely still kept talking about conquering lands and other stuff. It felt, to me, like the Charr were trying to *act* like they were innocent parties being maligned for protecting their land, but everything else in the world was making it clear that they weren't all that trustworthy.
---
I think the only reason the game gives us to not hate them is, basically, "But everyone needs to band together to defeat these villains." Also in terms of trying to show that not all Charr are sketchy or believe in the general Charr mentality. 
---
But yeah, one thing I was hoping would happen in this LS, and which is maybe happening, is that we see how the Charr act in a world where there isn't an impending threat forcing everyone to work together. I'd be happy for the writers to show how the Charr generally act as a society if they don't have any reasons to continue playing nice with the other races.
---
Ah yes. Enslaved engineer.
---
&gt; Anet found the perfect sweet spot!
---
Of course you'd say something like this lol
---
Nope, one scaling, at least for now. New episode, new scale.
---
I *think* their thought process is giving scourge a larger cleave will give small groups a better shot at punching up at blobs. They are just too dumb to realize that the blob will also use this trait and one push anything smaller than 30 players
---
Seeing how helpless is this poor Icebrood Construct, I think anet should add some pushing-away mechanic (aoe push-back or sth) when players are too huggy towards the boss. Or that thing with some bounties when you have to go ranged and melee depending on the active circle.
---
For me it works fine. I use both mounts - it always depends on the situation. Never had much trouble with griffon in situations where I wanted to use it. But everyone is different. If skyscale works better for you, then its all fine to use skyscale.
---
Never heard of Myst.... 
---
May his/her soul rest in piece though.
---
nice
---
Take a picture of you sitting in it
---
We really don’t drive up prices though. For instance, me putting my bloody reds up on sell offer every time one sells has single-handedly kept the price from going above 40g.
---
My demand for the item when I bought it kept it above 12g.
---
I made a fuck ton of money on that product, but if people like me aren’t around, like 80% of the TP listings just disappear. Meaning no one would ever be able to insta-buy or sell anything except for unreasonable prices.
---
On most items I make money off convenience. I provide demand for an item, and then later I provide supply. It goes both ways. Someone gets to sell and buy their items instantly at a price that they feel is fair, and I make a profit.
---
I’m neither spiking nor crashing the prices. Just increasing trade volume. Same with other TP merchants on pretty much every item.
---
The sell listing and sniping risks make massive buyups a huge gamble for most people. So most of us make money slow-rolling a bunch of items.
---
1000 hours sounds like a lot of play time and people will eventually get bored of anything after long enough. I will question though, did they perhaps real world trade to get the raiding and fractals gear? And did they do map completion? Get any legendaries?. Also, did they try playing as a different class to keep things fresh?
---
Aaahhhh yeah! lml
---
It's both nerfing dmg and healing scourge in pve.
---
At least for all moving bosses
---
Thank you for letting us know. He was in my guild and did some WvW with us and some raiding too. He was a nice guy and will be missed.
---
Except in MMOs everyone owns the means of production and there are 0 stakes and literally anyone can do the exact same thing. So your comparison is completely laughably flawed.
---
MMO economies are incomprehensibly simplified and puristic.
---
Honestly, it's the exact opposite.
---
Without that much boonspam, that much boon corrupt wouldn't be needed.
---
Right now in wvw, even if you get all boons corrupted, you will almost instant have them back up again
---
a lot of the people that said to skip minions explained they have situational uses..marks don't "spike" except staff 4 and you can't really use wells if your bar is filled with minions either..and regen is literally useless without healing power so that's just wrong advice overall
---
OP's problem is ultimately a lack of damage(their words) and having a bunch of AI slowly killing stuff with their single target piss-poor dps isn't the answer
---
stunbreak being necessary for lvl 20 story? gimme a break this isn't pvp lmao
---
I have the same issue with it. Having it as events means you're not allowed yo play WHAT you want WHEN you want.
---
PoP is quite fun to play around in PvP, but well for PvE scrapper got hit hard a lot of times now. 
---
Like hey, "how about we make Scrapper feel as squishy as a Thief without evade spam?"
---
None.
---
Farmed Silverwastes for gold + Fractals for the first ascended pieces, then they started raiding to get the rest, doesn't take that long to get the first set if you go for something as easy as power builds. A few of them got the raid legendary armor and probably all of them had legendary weapons. Not sure about the trinkets since I didn't care for them either. It's not content.
---
I'm not saying that 1-2k hours is little, just pointed out that 4k hours is an over exaggeration.
---
No. Its basically a slower raptor as far as pve is concerned
---
I do both. I log in and update trade offers and then run around in WvW and update offers in between fights or PvP matches.
---
Every once in awhile I help a friend get a legendary or some pizzazz to help with their aesthetic.
---
I play the game just like anyone else. I just have a lot of gold.
---
Absolutely.
---
Found him. You had to find him at the pub right after the first event. So i had to restart watch the whole show again and then i was able to finish the achie.
---
Auric Basin and Tangled Depths are great metas.
---
There are many games which cater exclusivly to hardcoreplayers, as https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoYcjeHVbnI . For big games it is more difficult to take such an approach. Most players can't spend 4h a day ingame. Wildstar was a great MMO, but did not succeed, despite catering to hardcoreplayers. 
---
&gt; There's also ways to design games that are easy to learn and difficult to master.
---
That's what I'm telling you the whole time. GW2 has no "learn". 
---
&gt;what exactly killed you 
---
At this point are you already dead, story is done.
---
&gt; Dungeons are hardly dead. 
---
I'm clearly refering to the age of the content, not to the amount of players still playing it. You can play GW1 and find more recent content than that. Are you still playing daily morrowind? Or warcraft 3? Players will not play dungeons daily/weekly for years. This would be no problem if HoT and PoF both would have added 10-20 new dungeons. They didn't. Zero teamcontent. That's a huge problem for guilds. Imagine no new raid content for the next 5 years. "But there are still many old raids, why are you complaining"? Right?
---
&gt;This is quite noticeable. 
---
Damage numbers stay the same, they don't double. You can't tell by looking at the numbers "whoha, warrior must have placed a banner somewhere". Which is the problem I described.
---
&gt;There aren't a dozen of those though. There's Banners, empower allies for warrior, spotter, and frost spirit for ranger, and the buff from Revenant that I can't recall at the moment. 
---
The whole garbage trait system is full of such buffs (damage mods alone more than double your dps). Classes got +power sigils. Even for might/vulnerability: running a skill as "on my mark" or "for great justice" are not doubling damage numbers. 
---
&gt;Lupi bubble can be bypassed with stability
---
You missed the point. If a casual gets struck by it, he dies usually. he can't pause the game and switch skills when he is stuck in it. 
---
&gt; Falling through is a failing on yourself
---
Read all what I wrote above twice, then try again. You completly missed the point.
---
&gt; how would "Does x% of damage" attacks actually be better design
---
Is already explained above. the part about degeneration.
---
&gt;That's not hardcore.
---
It is. Hardcore has not only to do with time spend, but also with mindset. Some people just log in to have fun, others read up guides before even trying some content, run dps meters, do excel spreadsheets to develop a build etc.
---
No sane person watches a guide first, learns the animations and then does lupi for the first time. Players usually go in and see what happens. If that boss kills them they get frustrated. As lengthily explained are other games much better at training (and indicating stuff to) players, which helps to avoid such frustration. These games are not easier than GW2. 
---
There are players which try to raid - and which struggle with CC. Just as the most obvious example. That's something you'd learn in the first 5 hours of gameplay in most games. These players are often veteran players, ingame since release. They don't know what their skills do. To cite a member of a friend-guild "i'm pressing skills on recast, they all do damage". No, some do more than that - like shooting enemies away. See all those stupid rangers shooting enemies out of stack. In dungeons you often see 20k AP players doing such shit. Such experienced players should have learned to perform better. They didn't, because the game as failed.
---
&gt;Where are you getting this information about how intelligent casuals are? 
---
I pug a lot. Do a few hundred dungeon runs with pugs and no requirements in lfg and see what happens. You'll mostly meet "good" players when pugging, btw. The worst players don't dare to pug, because they know they suck and they are afraid of others - or don't want to be burden to them. These players are only playing with their guilds/friends. A friend spend 4 hours in aetherpath with her guild. Just as an example.
---
&gt;The guaranteed block is better.
---
Wasn't the point. It was about the noob unfriendlyness of GW2s skill system. Easy to learn, hard to master. GW2 is not easy to learn. GW2 is just "hard to master". Casuals just don't notice, because you can do open world garbage without even knowing what your skills do. They haven't even started to "learn". That happens when they enter T2/T3 fractals - where they suddenly hit the wall. The content in which you could learn how to play is: dungeons+fractals. If you aren't farming them and only did them once or twice or so (back in 2013) you are not "raid ready" usually. Lack of such easier teamcontent = no training ground = players are stuck on tutorial level of game knowledge/player skill. In open world it is good enough to tag a boss.
---
&gt; If you played back when defiance had stacks, champions and higher could be blinded and weakened,
---
Most of the time you froze them with icebow for 4 seconds and killed them, before they were able to fight back. GW1 aegis is good because most fights are teamfights - and it reduces damage by 50% when many attacks hit. You are right that strong hits can still land. It's more comparable to GW2s protection. But every noob can use such an aegis and have a 50% damage reduction. GW2 aegis is unusable for beginners. Protection or regeneration are a better pick if you don't know the incoming attacks. Game trains players to use the wrong skills. They are not learning how to properly use aegis. If they need to learn it for some kind of content, they have to learn from scratch. Game hasn't trained them. One huge wall they have to climb, instead of climbing up many stairs step by step.
---
&gt;VG and KC have pulsing damage. 
---
Pulsing damage or degeneration etc. is for most casual groups not the problem. They can handle it. What kills them are strong hitting attacks and unique mechanics. Which was my point. For raids is this btw. also ~ fine - but not for dungeons/fractals (cms excluded). And especially not when there is nearly no of such content. A casual- or coregamer guild in GW2 can do what? Play WoW? That's btw. what has happened with nearly 95% of the players I know. "I'm not playing a MMO to play solo". 
---
&gt; You can't, on any raid or fractal boss, just spam your heal skills off cooldown and expect to succeed.
---
Wasn't my claim. My claim was that ressource management in GW2 is dumbed down. You are ofc not spamming heals mindlessly. You are not playing a druid with all skills available: "oh shit, I have to heal two people but can only afford to heal one." You also don't have to choose which one needs to be healed first. You are not risking to loose all your healoutput for the next 20 seconds if you heal one player in an emergency. Etc.
---
It is called Google. Check it out. I know it doesn't fit the narrative that you've probably been fed, but the simple fact of the matter is yeah. In fact, if you live in America right now you're probably amongst the top 5% of comparatively wealthy people who have ever lived.
---
Context is important.
---
Grinding has been the core of every single MMORPG since the genre first started...
---
Honestly, the only use I've found is on escort missions when you don't want to go too quickly. 
---
It's the basically griffon but without flight, mechanically.
---
ONE LEGION! ONE ARMOUR!
---
There's a nifty way to combat this. 
---
Don't offload the cost of every mistake onto healers. Instead, developers should target these people's mindset where it really hurts - their DPS. Make it so that every telegraphed ability from boss reduces their damage by 40% for like 10 seconds, refreshing and not stacking. Maybe add a screen-wide FX, like a purple outline, and a thorough explanation somewhere (at the start of the strike maybe) what it is (punishement to your dps) and why it is happening (because you haven't evaded abilities).
---
This is the best way to make them start paying attention to this training boss.
---
It honestly baffles me why there's no word on nofunction gyro. I sincerely hope these are not all the changes, and nofunction gyro will get buffed substantially, because right now it has ~1k hp and gets one-shotted by guardian down skill 2. Since it's an elite spec mechanic and a trade off it should just be invulnerable.
---
I think that's the intention
---
Cause you can no longer keep the F5 pulsing. Before, you bomb the zerg, and even if the zerg rushes through the bomb, they would still get bombed by you. 
---
Now, you bomb, but if the zerg is quick to react, they can dodge out of the bomb and completely avoid any further damage. Your only choice is to spend more shades to re position your shade skill. 
---
That, alongside some damage nerfs and barrier application, I think its an overall good change for scourge.
---
Honestly, I think the only way they could really do it is to charge 5 transmutation charges (or something) per out-of-type piece and have a warning that clipping will occur.
---
Good way to encourage people to continue farming those strikes, helping less skilled players who need the practice so that they don't spend waiting for more squad members for hours.
---
Cause its dumb. You just camp people from 1500 range with no possible counter play cause you outrange everyone.
---
...You think this is good balance?
---
Explain.
---
Awesome example of "raid introduction" for reluctant players. Can't wait for "PC power off solo" of this content.
---
To nitpick a drop, it’s most definitely not a horse. Much more like an enormous cat. 
---
There is also a running joke in the game that there are no horses at all
---
Not actually a question, but something interesting. It appears that there's a hidden achievement "Meet Your Imperator" for the prologue. I got it as a Blood Legion Charr during the Coming Home mission, right when you talk to Bangar for the first time. Wonder if other Charr legion backgrounds get it elsewhere?
---
Except you didn't. You are trying to make mental gymnastics here how my questions are not worth answering, while you are simply avoiding an answer, cause you don't really know what to say. Your thread is basically pushing like button on facebook - no context, no justification, just like it.
---
&gt; farming those strikes, helping less skilled players who need the practice  
---
Dude, literally ANYONE can finish those strikes.... It's unbelievably easy
---
"Introduction to Raiding".... Gets solo'ed in a couple days.... Nice
---
I switched 3 months ago from condi scourge to power scrapper in fractals and so far majority of people is ok having it - [hell, some are unaware](https://i.imgur.com/IcQLRSh.jpg) that scrapper is good as long you know how to play it as you say but then, there are dickheads who just follow the herd mentality, blindly copying statements and refusing to play with certain professions - not only scrapper but mirage or even power reaper (yes, that *powernecrofobia* still happens); a guy laughed out engineer icon and kicked me instantly - I had no chance to say and do anything incl. switching.
---
Is this a PvE player complaining about WvW decisions?
---
That's like a prepschool brat being mad about some homeless kid getting a toy.
---
wait wtf
---
&gt;running joke in the game that there are no horses at all
---
Yeah, I know. It was a tongue-in-cheek label. Kind of like calling the Springer a 'rabbit' LOL
---
Reading this reignited my salt with GW2 balance. My favorite elite spec is just a husk of it's former self.
---
You are too rude and I did not wrote anything wrong . Read again . You answer was " you do not know nothing". So who is the nasty one? Do what you want. Suppose you understood your errors. Have fun and get better
---
r/TheMonkeysPaw is leaking
---
Doesn't cost anything I dont think so you may as well unlock it.
---
If for what ever reason it has more use in the future it is there  waiting for you 👍
---
Well, I've done some 3D modeling and game skinning in the past, so I know that this would be non-trivial, but I also think it would be doable. If they *did* do it, it wouldn't be as simple as just "slap on a pair of heavy pants and light top and deal with the consequences." I think the "consequences" of that would be Lovecraftian. 
---
To make it work, I think they need to pick one standard, one basic concept that would *mostly* fit the other two (I think Medium is easiest, but I'm not sure), and then tweak both the other two sets into that mold. To us, the differences would be negligible, the waistlines would shift a little, and the animations for them might be a bit different, but on their end it would mean doing at least a little model work, maybe a little texture work, and then re-rigging the skeleton for the clothing to fit the "default" shape. That's what gives it physics properties. Even then there might still be clipping. 
---
But if they do it right, then "types" should cease to exist entirely. They might keep them around in the menus as an added way to organize things, but mechanically they would all be handled identically.
---
I asked for justification. There is nothing to discuss unless I see one. And stating he likes something is not a justification, I can't make reasonable discussion on someone's tastes unless they explain why they like things.
---
So as Steki said, this guy is posting pointless praising. If he was bashing the game in similar fashion, you would be here tearing him apart. You're basically a hypocrite.
---
PoF starting out was great - a few people complained about the lack of events, meta etc. - but I found that map fairly pleasant to get around, too.
---
It's only when we got further into the expansion it started to feel like an annoyance.
---
I don't see why it's impossible to have a map that's fun to just get around and explore, *and* a compelling meta for people to take part in, however.
---
To add, even ascended weapons from spec collections can be swapped with the forge recipe to something you do want, if not immediately available
---
What do you mean by addons?
---
&gt; I mean, didn't the Charr kill there own gods?
---
I'm pretty sure that was the Klingons.
---
&gt;Go ahead, wear full soldier's gear in fractals, never dodge, never do anything other than auto attack, and barely move. You won't survive past T3.
---
Indeed. That's the problem. With soldiers gear you shouldn't even be able to leave the starting zones. Or at least somewhere "on the way" you should have learned how to play. You should've learned the basics long before entering fractals. Fractals is btw. also not enough content to train such basics. To train basics you need to do fractals often - which most players don't. Most players don't bother with doing fractals daily, they don't enjoy it. So they never learn how to play. Daily dungeon runners and daily fractal runners had no problems to adapt to raids. Open world players did. Because the game never trained them how to play.  (also see the many complains about raid gear: every dungeon runner etc. had raid gear. Open world players in their nomad gear or whatever need to switch. "Instanced content players" know how to play and are equipped.)
---
&gt;Not all enemies share the same animations
---
That was the problem I described, yes. So someone who doesn't know the content (because he hasn't done it dozens of times) does not know what animations do. That's a huge advantage of skillbars. Players can tell on their first try "this skill is healing them" - especially when enemies and players share the same skill-pool. If you can read an boss ele casting "meteor shower" you know what is going to happen. If he just raises his left arm you don't if you are fighting the boss for the first time.
---
This is bad design. For experienced players it makes no difference in difficulty. Unexperienced players struggle with "artifical difficulty", a lack of knowledge. Game is not providing enough info.
---
&gt;What's true is that the combat log could be improved and show off better what killed you. 
---
Would be bad design. You should know what kills you before it has killed you. If you then fuck up and get killed: ok, your fault. But you should know when the attack is incoming that this is going to kill you. Not afterwards like "haha, you died because you got hit by X".
---
That's bad game design. A good game tells you beforehand, so you can try to avoid such an attack. Not afterwards - then it's too late. a frustrating design.
---
&gt;The mentality of "I can't do it on my first try, this content is bad." needs to go away.
---
Not if the game trains you. You can have the same difficulty as now. As example: someone who played to level 100 legitimate in fractals, step by step, has learned a bit how to play. But to do so he had to endlessly repeat the same fractal levels. That's relativly hardcore and most players don't do it. And that's the problem. If GW2 would add 10 new dungeons each year: players would slowly improve and learn how to play. They would then succeed on more difficult content on the first try. Because they know how to play to some degree. Someone who is very experienced in T3 fractals is very likely going to succeed when he tries a T4 fractal for the first time. Someone who already struggled with T3 is probably going to fail. That's fine.
---
&gt; Dungeons are stuck in 2013-2014 balance
---
Indeed. Which is why they are now not suited to teach players how to play anymore. You can now (sadly) faceroll most of them. And even in 2014 were dungeons not well designed, most bosses died in seconds against a good party. Icebow freeze and kill them before they could fight back. Dps difference between builds in GW2 is too huge to properly balance bosses for all possible options. Dungeons were apparently not designed for full dps teams.
---
&gt;But the thing is, I sat down, and kept at it, learned the bosses, learned my class and what could counter those mechanics if that, and kept coming back because the content was fun, especially with friends.
---
See: that's something hardcore players do. They invest time, learn to play, read guides, optimize, train.
---
Casual- and coregamers mostly want to have fun. If you want to kill a raidboss once (and never again) having to train for 10h is a huge barrier. And if GW2 would have tried to keep these players (which are usually the huge majority of the playerbase) it would perform better. A casual player can turn into a more invested player if the likes the game. I started doing dungeons in half soldier, half zerk. Easy dungeon paths. I repeated dungeons often. I slowly changed pieces of my equipment. Bought new runes, sigils. Changed traits. Slowly. Over months. If I would have stopped after doing dungeons twice or so: I would have never reached the level I'm now on. Casuals- and coregamers don't "farm" content endlessly. They need a broad variety of content. They need maybe 10 dungeons each year. Then they'll go through the same process and try to optimize. But currently? They do each dungeon once or twice, maybe start switching some traits. Then they are done with dungeons and return to open world. Where they then switch back traits and forget everything they learned after half a year.
---
But this strike mission is nothing like raids, it's like saying that the golem boss in Mount Maelstrom is a simple and easy first step.
---
Like arcdps or mount dial etc.
---
Nope, still not touching that shit.
---
I thought this issue was fixed with this month W10 update. At least it works smoother for after, without messing with registry.
---
After years of necromancer not being viable and still playing them, then after years of revenants being the joke class of the game before becoming viable, I feel it is my responsibility to make a scrapper now and defend it vigorously.
---
This is my time.
---
I’ve heard wonders about the function gyro, please point me in that direction.
---
I liked this fight. The floor wasn't coated in orange circles and dodging had a use again.
---
[When you sit in it, you get a snowy effect.](https://www.buffed.de/Guild-Wars-2-Spiel-17072/News/Neue-Skins-Durch-Blut-Gebunden-1332689/galerie/3308778/?fullsize)
---
Exactly. This ain’t an “intro to raids”, this is “intro to level 10 personal story”.
---
Do you have the latest windows 10 update installed ? KB4515384
---
It caused the game to crash on startup, I uninstalled the update and it works now , not sure if they patched that since .
---
Is there a teleport scroll for the new map?
---
You should see the market talks for EVE Online, make this one look like a my first buy-and-sell class.
---
I mean...by that rationale, it's at the very least no less valid than the OP telling people to use a guide, soooooo...
---
¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Ultimately though, I think people get it without your having to spell it out for them. Use a guide...don't use a guide... don't have to tell people to do what makes them happy.
---
I have never heard of those. If you mean addons for the game I have nothing
---
Is Icebrood just story content or will raids and fractals such be added?
---
Gryphon fanbois are so cute...
---
PSA: skyscale is better and will get from point a to point b FASTER in most situations (except when you already start high).
---
Also skyscale is most definitely not 70g, the saddle cost alone from the S4 mats is 35g + 27550 VM.
---
(27550 vm at todays prices is around 110g.
---
Then u need to add the foods, lamp, toys, etc.
---
At it's realease skyscale was over 300g (without using tp). Now it's 200ish.
---
how do I uninstall the update? I'm not software savvy
---
Is it possible to buy gems without a credit card or game cards? I haven't seen any gw2 gift cards around where i live and i only have debit card and paypal.
---
There is not, but then again any character who has access to black citadel can take the helicopter to go to blood legion homelands. I expect them to be introduced later on.
---
Thanks for the insight :)
---
Generally, if they're not listed on https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers/ then it's not worth the risk. Sketchy non-affiliated sites have a habit of fraudulant transactions (like stolen CCs) and it can lead to your account being closed as a charge-back is issued. Sure, some of the sales will be legit, but IMO, it's not worth the risk to your account.
---
Obviously my experience is anecdotal but I’ve got  over 2.5k hours and I’ve still got tons to do: I’ve not done fractals past tier 2, still haven’t even entered most of the dungeons, never raided and I don’t do PvP or WvW. I also have never farmed for anything. 
---
I still believe I could get 4k out of the game, but maybe I’m just lucky and that’s not a widespread experience.
---
How to uninstall a specific Windows update
---
Search for this on the page I linked you , not the restore to a previous version , you have to uninstall the specific one .
---
Skimmer and Skyscale more so are your friends.
---
For me personaly, as a completionist who loves to do everything, take it slowls, get all the lore n story. I have weeks of play from every content drop. Ppl that complain there isnt enough content, simply focus on one specific type of it.
---
Enjoy sitting through a long ass first story instance where you *have* to follow a NPC *walk* to his destination, watch another NPC do his five minutes speech, interact with four canons, watch *more* NPC talks, then spam events until the bar fil (and don’t you dare forget to go see Braham for Chaperone, otherwise you’ll go through that another time), just so you can select the right dialogue options with the cub.
---
If that’s your jam, you do you. I don’t consider this fun. We’re looking at 2 hours of playtime *per attempt*.
---
Buddy, with flair like that and your childlike questions, I'm not surprised people are less than willing to respond to you.
---
You can make Spicy Moa Wings and sell them instead.
---
I think you may have tagged the wrong user - I only posted one video link, and that was just in support of showing someone that McDonald's has interests beyond selling fries.  I haven't put forth any commentary on TP or MMO economies beyond that.
---
A casual player is someone who loggs in maybe 2-4 times a month, spends 1-2 hours each and does barely care about ingame achievements as legendary etc.
---
A coregamer is someone a bit more invested who plays maybe once a twice a week, is maybe part of a community like a guild in which he contributes (as example by participating in activities) and who has some ingame goals as a legendary weapon.
---
A hardcoreplayer is a very dedicated player, who loggs in several times a week. Who is achievement farming. Or who is aiming for several legendary weapons or similiar stuff and farming lots of gold for it. Or who is searching challenges and trying to beat them. As raids or fractal cms.
---
Ofc is there no 100% objective definition. There are probably players which log in once a month, but who min max, got excel spreadsheets etc. Or casuals which log in once a week for guild activities.
---
Learning by failure is hardcore. The more casual way to learn is by optimizing: if your first run takes 1 hour and you decide to switch a sigil or trait to improve a bit. That's the casual way.
---
You need to know CC, what your skills do, your traits, metabuilds, you need to know what the enemy boss does, so a lot of knowledge is required. Most players don't even know the CC skills of their main class. But yes, that's no real in depth knowledge as buildcrafters have. I exaggerated this, sorry.
---
We have two kinds of bells. And I bet there's a cow tonic out there somewhere.
---
Costs a WvW reward track...which might otherwise be a GoB for a legendary... that's why I don't have it.
---
wow very nice community, i hope we never meet ingame, mr. Elitist.
---
well, if it works it aint bad. I can finish my Content, dont run into problems, but people like you always seem to find a way to suck metas dick.
---
"Only good for Condi cleanse in pvp" Then tell me why i finish every game with top Kills, up to 600k damage and win every teamfight i join. its probably the condi cleanse...
---
and you would be surprised how many people struggle to even hit the 10k dps. But as long as we dont wipe and people know them tactics i dont mind them in my Party.
---
shitposters, who brag about their dps and dont tolerate nonmeta builds and instakick people are also the reason why i dont even want to start with raids. i've heard enough of that shitty attitude.
---
You just can't play WvW without warclaw though. Gonna be an easy pick target running after your allies.
---
You are so savagely ripping apart the typical mediocre arguments regarding underused, underdeveloped elite specs.
---
The only childlike thing here is saying "I like this lollipop with gw2 flavour" without explaining why. The way you talk to me only shows your bias and prejudice, with no reason other than a silly flair. But you are probably too high to get that.
---
I absolutely expect the Far Shiverpeaks to be **loaded** with enemies. 
---
We're in one of the Charr homelands, and we're celebrating the peace following the death of Kralky. It's good that the map design reflects the story, it's really really good, but there's no way that when we start pushing into Jormag's domain that it's going to stay as peaceful.
---
Sadly it overall became a thing to call everyone that enjoys things that need just a bit more effort than "Everyone can do it from the moment you pick it up" elitist. 
---
if you like you can also put a toxic in front of it if elitist if saied person dissagreed with your opinion in how easy/hard/simple/complex stuff should be. On reddit this luckily isn´t the case that often... but Hell the steam forums are cancer when it comes to this. or not just this... the steam forums are cancer overall...
---
I mean, middle ground? Why 500 and not, let’s say, 300? Why 100 cooking ingredients instead of, let’s say, 50? 
---
Big numbers give an impression of insecurity on replayability of the event while the event itself should be a big incitation to do it.
---
Yeah from the Doomlore event.
---
Staff 2 giving regen is present whether you find it useful or not.  If you are looking for any form of healing and your heal is on cd, it’s good to know where it exists.  It is factually existent, I’m not sure how that is wrong.
---
Ok, dropping staff 3 for chill, well of corruption and staff 4 can be called whatever you like.  If you want to come up with a term for it, I’ll be waiting at the edge of my seat.
---
Obviously, you don’t have to take 3 minion utilities.  Life exists outside of meta builds.
---
Stun break is useful anywhere you can be disabled.  It’s the difference between laying in a red circle and not.
---
Do you have any actual advice or are you just complaining?
---
To be fair, you think this changes or harms scrapper much? In pvp and wvw detection pulse is likely stronger. In pve detection pulse has only niche uses, but the same is true for chemical field. It's not like condi scrapper is a thing, and its output isnt determined by chemical field either.
---
Just people complaining about their meme builds being changed at all because of muh feels. It's a nerf, but it's a pretty inconsequential one.
---
They’ve designed the entire achievements system around players using guides. I’ve stopped doing the achievements: it disrespects my time.
---
This specific tactic, putting achievements on open world elements that are not easily repeated, has been present at least since A Bug in the System. I think the only way to understand this is that they don’t bother to get the achievements on live themselves. I hung out on a dev livestream for a Bug in the System and it seemed the devs didn’t even know some achievements were locked behind a complete replay.
---
I quit after that theater fail and came back today because I see shit posts like this one on reddit.
---
Went on new map and realized how the people of reddit are lying (blinded by love I guess). I even suspect ANet devs to have fake accounts and praising their own game.
---
What I saw in prologue was.. Well it was prologue and really wasn't worth logging in. There wasn't a single thing on map that took my breath away. 
---
I am charr main and I love charr but it didn't help me. The new map is sadly shitty for me and there is no epic comeback for me. 
---
Can't wait to enrage all the fanbois just because I don't like that new shiny epic map that our lord and savior ANet brought to us. I will wait until these people will be again crying like little bitches because ANet hurt them. Then they start loving them again after one patch..
---
Gw2 never changes..
---
 [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Event\_timers](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Event_timers)   
---
Use LFG.
---
Replaying the story is not some horrible arduous task. 
---
Having to go through a story instance that asks you to be passive for most of it is not engaging content and I don’t want this to become a pattern for future releases. Requiring one hour or two hours of playthrough just so you can try an achievement again is also overkill. 
---
Needing to repeat entire instances have been a problem since A Crack in the Ice and the devs have since go out of their way to make it manageable and more accessible to us. They have been improving on this for numerous episodes.
---
But then with this prologue there are two cases where they moved backward. The open world story cheevos and the last instance (if you fail you have to do the last instance again completely).
---
I personally hope strike missions go on 'series' that get harder and add more mechanics over time.
---
This one doesn't even have defiance bars. The next one could have them too.
---
Then the next Strike could have spots where you must stand to share the damage or everyone is hit hard. Then adds that must be cleared, sequence mechanics, transformations, and so on until the last strike of a series is as complex as a raid encounter.
---
Dude, just loot into the game, there are tons of stuff depending on races. o.o
---
It's not that hard...
---
My problem with the audio, especially with the new dialoge system without the window what pops up where you see your character and the character hes talking to on the other side of the screen, which causes random ambient dialoges to interfer with my story dialog and i dont understand any of both D:
---
Focusing on grawl would be smarter, yes, but Charr don't enjoy torturing grawl slaves as much as they do their human ones.
---
Im sure the 15 of them will make due
---
Download the latest patch and restart your bot
---
You sound like one of those people crying during Season 2 that we had to replay story instances more than once to be eligible for achievements. And look! Now achievements are in your face from the first time you play the story, to the point where most players pay more attention to them than the actual content!
---
So keep making posts like this!! If you get enough traction, maybe you won't have to play the game at all :O You can just log in and be given AP for free!!
---
Two things: 1. This is literally the first mission which is meant to slowly introduce noobs to the mechanics which will eventually get harder as it goes on.  
---
2.This person is a veteran top tier player that knows mechanics, their skills, and has probably raided before.
---
the one major difference is Bangar isn't all that spooky, Hes just a angry charr who wants his own dragon and WILL endup being icebrooded or converted to our side after a fight and realization. Hes just the Prologue villain to segway us into the actual Big bad. hes a half decent character for what his purpose is.
---
Do you skip cutscenes on single player games you replay sometime? If so, why?
---
What is the difference of this spreadsheet and [GW2efficiency](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/legendaries)?
---
I just wanna enable this to make it feel even closer to the original game.  I love GW1.
---
Yeah, Gandara is disregarded as to how bad it is.
---
Grothmar is ostensibly friendly territory. It's more akin to ebonhawke, a city-but-not-quite
---
Of course there ain't hordes of enemies there...
---
But we are about to deal with a Charr assault on Jormag. Theres gonna be hordes of hostiles during a conflict like that...
---
"tons of stuff". Cool.
---
Sometimes I don't understand, why they remove some skills not even try to fix it.
---
Lies.
---
You can get a chair.
---
A CHAIR.
---
&gt;The sheer amount of achievement points makes it interesting to play even weeks after release.
---
How do you know, the patch has been out for two days?
---
oh first time i heard that so then it is even easier to get and i am now more annoyed that i was dumb to get that one first. But since nothing like this was never a thing ever before i feel i had no way of knowing.
---
Unless it upgrades the one you already have and can get more out of the node in your homeinstance. In that case it would be fine, but i doubt that is the case.
---
Hopefully yes.
---
But you dont have to do it....?
---
Anet releases new specs/classes/skills at their highest potential and then nerfs them into obsolescence. they've been doing this since GW1. I wonder is how this, one of many of their patterns of disloyalty to their "community", helps their business model. It seems counterproductive to actively work to make their product less enjoyable, and they've only gotten louder and louder complaints over the years that they have to comb through their forums to delete. they must be getting so much gem money from that little chunk of players who think they're still logged into IMVU

you must be new. There is nothing against the LFG rules so no bans
---
OP is currently on dopamine rush. He likes those things because they are new. When novelty runs off, he will start thinking about stuff and may change his opinion. Or not.
---
It’s not banned because Anet gets profit from people buying raids with gems

If you click tools &gt; script editor you should be able to see how to write API calls if you want to make your own or enhance this one

**TLDR**: You're a hypocrite and a bore, and I'm utterly unsurprised that OP had no time for you. I'm sure you won't stop considering yourself some erstwhile champion for "reasoned discussion", but if you ever experience a flash of introspection, maybe come back and read what I wrote.
---
you can use search filter to hide things you don't like to see, e.g. "-sell" removes posts consisting of "sell"
---
Thank you for sharing your opinion.
---
If only we had polymock with themed pieces we could use the skins on!
---
PM'dyou before I saw this 😘
---
Great, now I cant sleep without thinking about lämp looking tag.
---
I completely agree with you that boons definitely have the upper hand these days, they come from too many sources and some classes just plain have too much access to them. I think a lot of problems could be solved by reducing corrupts and conversions, and returning to boon strips and condi cleanse. Right now boons and condis are just feeding one another uncontrollably in large groups (largely due to antitoxin runes).
---
I hesitate to say we should use pvp builds, I really like the build diversity possible in the current system and would much rather see changes be made to bring traits more in line with each other
---
That's a scrapper problem though, not a problem with stand your ground
---
202g 99s.
---
I just invested a 50g chunk into my legendary. Trying to build it back up before I do another big purchase.
---
Be interesting to see what Cmaj can do with it 👍😲
---
That may be the cause. I'll try again with a different char.
---
&gt; It's much easier to take in your surroundings and just appreciate the sheer, ridiculous detail put into an area when you're not having to worry about your imminent death every five seconds.
---
Yeah. It's almost damn near impossible to chill and take screenshots in PoF areas thanks to this. Which is a shame because the locations and the design is super unique and intriguing to me.
---
what indeed
---
Lmao the asura catapulting
---
It's more of a disappointment, since people were expecting buffs or quality of life improvements, specifically for the function gyro (which got completely ignored by Anet).
---
I agree this change is barely significant either way, and is actually a buff in WvW... but the frustration comes with Anet turning a blind eye to the specs actual problems.
---
My sound issue during this patch was if my back was to the person talking I could barely hear them at all.  Most notable in the Sous-Chef event when I could hear him says what he wanted done to it because he had already turned away and ran behind me.  It was very annoying
---
for the same reason you are not banned. nothing illegal
---
And raids began to die
---
Yeah. There could be a list of polymock pieces, and different ways to get more:
---
* Earning them by playing in daily repeatable Adventure minigames vs AI. There would be a chance for tradable figurines to drop from chests.  
---
* Earning them in daily and monthly polymock tournaments.
---
* A vendor that sells figurines in exchange for Polymock tokens and gold or karma, just figurines without any relation to minis.
---
* A vendor that sells figurines with the same appearance as minis for polymock tokens and gold, available to purchase if you own a corresponding mini.
---
Figurines that share the same skills would not be equippable at the same time in your set of polymock figurines "on hand", essentially behaving as alternate skins.
---
The might and barrier from scourge is obviously great too! Ahahah 
---
Decent damage on em as well.
---
Anet policy about it : https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025699913?flash_digest=a4d02c53c1df5e2aadf8a72932c3ed962ade5383
---
I mean really it's still 5 corrupts gone.  Since the amount of shade spike is still the same, since you could hit 10 targets before.. split 5 in 2 different locations. Except now it's 10 targets in 1 location.  So they aren't really adding the amount of corrupts to shades at all.. just reducing the affected area the corrupts can take place, but increasing the target limit in that smaller area.
---
&gt; I mean...by that rationale, it's at the very least no less valid than the OP telling people to use a guide, soooooo...
---
Touché. I thought of editing my OP to reflect more the advice side of it.
---
Thats the problem though isn't is?  There is nothing wrong with the glyphs - the problem is with the ascended nodes
---
Myst was a really nice guy to hang around and just talk with, he really enjoyed the game and my favorite moments with him was when we tortuously completed our Aurora Collection together.  The game just isnt the same without you Myst.
---
This!!! I love taking screenshots but I don't love dying everytime I get one. Hopefully aggro range is less insane in future releases.
---
And for how I enjoyed to play the gamemode it has become unplayable. Altho not only due to warclaw, it certainly reinforced previous issues.
---
 I'm very curious how you like roaming better with warclaw. In my experience low man roaming, especially with melee classes is mostly dead. Plenty of ganky clouds and PPT clouds racing from one place to another, I suppose its that.
---
We know activity and coverage dropped compared to before warclaw in both EU and NA. I'd say it's fair a majority of wvwers didnt enjoy it enough to keep playing.
---
But as long as some people like it, even if they barely play wvw, i suppose it's a good change!
---
Imagine if they had done that in the theatre instead wasting their time with some guy talking about [Funko poops](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/43/aa/cd/43aacde0d1913b0549206ed1efada0cb.png).
---
They even have a polymock UI designed back then.
---
Inb4 ANet does a technical deathmetal asura band next.
---
Which I would totally dig.
---
Damn thats cool. Also, I think someone mentioned that since it has (Fire) damage, enemies you kill with it do their "burning death" animation when killed.
---
Honestly, I love healing on Scourge because it doesn't play like a heal/support, but like a DPS.  You just run different traits, utilities, runes and sigils.  I'm running the half Marshal half Shaman varient, and I've seen no issues with players staying alive even in T4 Sirens or TO.  Those few who went down would have gone down same as with any other healer.  The difference though is I'm putting out some decent DPS as well as boon strip and CC.
---
In a melee meta where you regularly push into 300 range of the enemy ball or scourges I'd agree. 
---
Compared to the pirateship meta of pof its bullshit. The only class that does this is spellbreakers.
---
&gt; Again, I want the system to be balanced without having to play it as a market simulator. I want the best possible outcome to also be the simplest outcome.
---
then why do you choose a game with a community driven economy?
---
i can tell you it wont be an mmo, play a single player game.
---
I am impatiently awaiting word back from my support ticket on this issue now.
---
He absolutely did. He also vastly failed to consider the value of natural resources, only considering the value of the labor required to extract said resource, rather then the resource itself, which is just blindly stupid. Labor is, in the modern world of high population, extremely replaceable, while the high demand for limited resources means the resource itself is likely worth several times over the labor required to extract it. This may sound heartless, but when you consider that it may take a crew a mere hour to extract several barrels of oil, but those barrels of oil may then be used to feed and supply hundreds if not thousands, you begin to see why. The value of the oil itself is intrinsically much higher then that of the labor used to retrieve it, which Marx would disregard out of hand.
---
I could spend all day treating Marx like a philosophical punching bag, but that's not my goal here. I just wanted to provide a quick counterweight to the pushing of Marxist ideology, because a lot of people never bother to look into the flaws of what he wrote and advocated, when they are fairly obvious once pointed out.
---
I honestly felt only GvG Scrappers ran Antitoxin anyways. Your general pugging/pugmander Scrapper would have run Monk runes as that way they would be a balance of good healing throughput and condi cleanse / boons.
---
Last i checked player trading wasnt an exploit.
---
You are correct. The fix is lazy, but thats probably the only thing they could do, because they didnt consider this during design process.
---
Thanks bro!
---
Arent thoose 3 the ones you get depending on timer? Because the timer ones specifically mention that theyre daily
---
Y’all getting chrono’d.
---
Yes they are on the timer
---
I'm in the camp of Rytlock saying no to leading (insert a joke about Logan sitting at a desk as pact marshal here) and Crecia taking over as Blood Imperator, she's got Flame ties so can keep them in the fold while also having the respect of Iron and Ash.
---
Rytlock will probably be some kind of envoy to our guild/Aurene (if he doesn't do the heroic dad sacrifice thing), while Almorra remains the leader of the Vigil and thus the ties to the Pact.
---
Who stops you from playing around in exotic gear, apart from fractals?
---
I use the Marshal/Shaman on my scourge during raids! Basically unkillable too, which is a neat bonus.
---
That unexplored zone is the JP/KhanUr place, it's a tunnel.
---
The best tag~
---
 Before that, I made the flame-legion event. It can also be that it is from there. But I first looked in my inventory at the end of the JP.
---
1. What mechanics?
---
2. Not that the player is bad, but he's not top tier. He didn't once do a Perfect Weave, which is a major dps increase on condi weaver build, as it extends the duration of the Weave Self buff by 50% and he often wasted fire auras by manually casting the skill while his detonate one was on CD. A top tier raider wouldn't do either.
---
its literally soloable first try, some story bosses are even harder
---

If my *what*?

Haven't played in a long time...my '100% world complete' was an engineer. Was thinking of dipping in again.

I hate Tangled Depths
---
Was going to ask the same lol
---
Holy shit, they actually nerfed Hammer 2
---
Kits cause you to exit forge mode, so they could be used to circumvent the minimum 6 secs in forge and avoid overheating. That's literally the only reason. I think kits and forge are both derived from the bundle/environmental weapon system, so they probably couldn't make kits not drop you out of forge.
---
I would like it to get a breakbar and only be able to take damage once it is broken in addition to more hp. So it would actually be able to finish or rezz someone.
---
I use Day/Night time and it helped for example to know when is the dusk (the time when the concert begins)
---
Imagine for a moment you have gone through the story with all of your characters.  But you missed an achievement that can in no way be obtained unless you A)  delete an existing character or B) pay money to buy another character slot.
---
I didn't know that, I had always wondered why the cutscenes didn't have any sound at all for me :s
---
We all hate Tangled Depths.
---
I'm convinced the ones who say they love it simply hate themselves too, and the double negatives cancel one another out.
---
SO MUCH THIS!! The little details in this map are so fantastic and I haven't had the chance to explore as in depth as I usually do. I saw the awakened merchant and I smiled so big it hurt. Can't wait to get home and really look around.
---
You mean firebrand is kind of op right now , even tho I love it
---
Are you people looking forward to official build templates? You both are really fast at switching traits, skills, and weapons, that must have taken a lot of practice.
---
Watching this really makes me want to try to solo it. It looks like it'd be fun.
---
it's just so you can't circumvent the heat mechanic.
---
Toolbelt overheat though, that's just stupid.
---
I doubt me (or left) are gonna use build templates unless it is absolutely necessary in a situation because you simply have to retrait in 5 seconds or otherwise lose a lot of time. To me retraiting resembles a huge part of why speedrunning is fun, so I prefer to do it manually and will still prefer it once build templates are out.
---
Pretty much what everyone else mentioned, nothing except just visual preference. That being said, it would be nice if they at least let it have the triple endurance bar in PvE if you've unlocked it in your WvW Abilities. Like it's not something that's going to really put it on equal grounds in terms of performance with the other mounts, but it would a nice little buff for PvE while just standardizing the feel of it between the two game modes.
---
what is it in English
---
I meant in the sense of solo dps , but yes : class stacking is a huge problem in the current meta.. I think dps chronos , dhs and fb wouldn’t be as popular , even tho I consider them to still be good without the self buffing
---
AR needs to be reworked to be fully account-wide, by splitting infusions into 3 separate parts: upgrades that give stats, account-wide AR and the visual effects.
---
For example, it could be something like this: 
---
###Upgrades
---
When they finally introduce ascended trinket crafting, they should also take the opportunity to turn infusions into the exclusive upgrade for trinkets like runes for armor and sigils for weapons, removing them from armor and weapons, and merging them with Jewels into a single type of upgrade just for trinkets, with just 3 tiers like runes and upgrades, craftable in the Jeweler station.
---
Amulets would keep the enrichment slot, but they would also have it at lower levels now, instead having a slot for a jewel. The stats from the jewels at lower levels would not be lost, they would simply be moved to amulets of the same stat combination that can have that jewel inserted in them. Enrichments Jewels would also come in 3 tiers: master, rare and exotic, and like other Jewels, they would be craftable in the Jeweler station. 
---
What about backs? They could be removed as items, existing only as selectable visuals, like gliders or outfits, and in the process of replacing them, also make them dyeable, like when they replaced town clothes with outfits.     
---
This would allow people to switch backs much more freely, and allow them to match their colors with gliders.  
---
Of course, the stats backs used to have would not be lost, they would be moved. I'd go with moving them to amulets.
---
So amulets would get extra base stats from losing the jewel slot and from getting them from backs, and no stats would be lost in the process. 
---
That leaves just 4 Jewel slots: 2 for accessories, and 2 for rings.  
---
We currently have 20 infusion slots (6 in armor, 4 in weapons, 2 in back, 2 in accessories, 6 in rings), so they could reduced to just 4 slots: 2 in accessories, 2 in rings, that's 20*5=+100 stats, so those +100 would be split between 4 trinkets. Either evenly (25 for each one) or unevenly (+30 for accessories, +20 for rings).
---
Amulets would keep enrichment, but any visuals in enrichment would be moved to a separate panel.    
---
Since Jewels only have stats now, the reworked jewel/infusion merge could instead have more varied effect. It should be something new and nice that that doesn't overlap too much with runes and sigils, like the extra effects of WvW infusions.  
---
+1 infusions, loot infusions and infusions bought from the laurel vendor would then become the material to craft Jewels and visuals unlockers at the Jeweler and the Mystic forge.
---
   
---
There could also be legendary Jewels that allow you to choose their properties from a list.  
---
###Agony
---
Agony would then be moved to an account value like luck, but it would still get capped by the number of pieces of ascended gear you have equipped, so people don't go in high tier fractals with exotics or lower rarity gear and annoy other players by being exceedingly squishy and inefficient.  
---
To get 150 or more AR, you would need to equip full ascended or legendary gear. If at least 1 item you have equipped is not ascended or legendary, you would get a cap of 150 lowered by -10 for each piece of gear that isn't ascended, -20 for 2h weapons.   
---
Since backs would be are removed as gear, that's 15 pieces of equipable gear, and so the cap can't go under 0.  
---
For example, with ascended weapons and trinkets, but exotic or lower armor, you'd get a 150-6*10 cap of 90. Even if you have AR over 150, that character would need to equip ascended or legendary armor to get more than 90 AR.
---
When all gear equipped is ascended or legendary, the cap is removed and you get all your account AR in full effect, even if it's higher than 150. 
---
To make sure people still craft infusions, the infusions required to be consumed to increase account AR would also increase with the tier:
---
 +1 infusions would only get you up to 10 AR, +2 up to 20, +3 up to 30 and so on. The number of infusions required for each tier would be balanced to keep more or less the same cost  as getting 150 AR just from infusions now.
---
Since the cost grows exponentially, each tier could require just 10 of that tier's infusion: 10 +1 to reach 10AR, 10 +2 to reach 20 AR, and so on.  
---
Past 150 AR, the cost would spike, and you would need +16 infusions to get to 160 AR, and so on.  A massive cost, but still doable. 
---
Account Augments and potions would still work and would get added on top of Account AR, just like how luck from AP rewards and boosters gets added to account luck. 
---
###Visuals
---
As for the visuals, they could be moved to a new customization section where you would choose the effects infusions currently have like auras, particle effects, coloring, shader effects, skin replacements, etc.   
---
Infusions would be usable directly to unlock visuals with a right click when they are expensive, but the cheap ones would have to be used in recipes to craft the actual items that unlocks the visual.   
---
There would be a limited number of slots for these visuals, like 6 or so, so it would still be possible to stack visuals, just not as much.  
---
There could also be 'stacked' versions of visuals that are crafted with several of one infusion, but they would not be equippable at the same time.    
---
To keep the number of alternate stacked versions low, they could be just x1, x5, x10 and x20.
---
So one could craft, unlock and select a x20 Ghostly infusion visual, but not a x10 one twice. 
---
Some types would be stackable, like colorizes but others would not be stackable, like particle effects and stacked auras. So you could equip a skin, a simple aura and a particle effect, but not 2 different stacked auras.  
---
Some effects from legendary gear could also be unlocked when binding the legendary gear to the account, like auras or skill effects.
---
**TL;DR: They need to rework infusion, AR  and their visuals into something else more alt-friendly when they introduce ascended trinket crafting**
---
If you do a straight chargeback through your bank you will get your money but obviously Anet will ban you for it, if support refunds your money nothing like that will happen.
---
Sick of you

#ERROR!

https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/d6cbxe/strike_mission_reward_the_chilly_chaise/
---
Shoulders too.
---
I asked the devs some months ago what happened to their idea of account wide AR. The answer was that they also don't like the current system, but that it is too late and too much work to change it now and that they probably will never have the time/money to justify a rework. They also didn't want to invalidate the infusions of players who already acquired them, so they would have to come up with some form of compensation. Because there will probably no pure account wide AR system in GW2 they instead introduced the fractal upgrades that grant account wide AR resistance.
---
Quick question, since I haven't played the new release yet:
---
Is "bound by blood" a reference to the machinima https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWCTlxEp6Ds by JackMcDaniel, especially with the metal concert?
---
34g. I've been playing since just before HoT released and the max I've ever had was 250 for the Griffin.  
---
I'm the definition of the casual player though. Spend most of my time leveling alts and doing open world stuff, occasionally some Fractals but I've only got as far as T2. Any gold I do get comes from dipping in to PvP for a bit just for the rewards. Until someone gets annoyed at me for not actually being good and then I leave again.
---
I'm still a newb in PvP but what you say makes sense, since at best you might reveal their DE or S/D Thief, while dropping a poison field on point is a lot more important and useful against any profession.
---
I maintain this is just a bad idea for a fix, and the only reason they are picking on chem field is ANET is convinced that it's a useless toolbelt, or at least feel the players think it is useless.
---
They should just revert this nonsense of turning Function Gyro into F5 and start again...but that requires them to admit making a mistake, which just isn't done these days apparently.
---
with that snow effect its in the top 2 of chairs for me
---
Honestly, how is this even remotely near a scam?
---
A scam, by definition, is where you are promised something that sounds very good to be true and you never get it.
---
In this case, you are getting what was promised to you, so what should I care if the other person in the deal makes more money than me or if they have to play the game to get it or not?
---
I am happy with my part of the deal, I do not care about doing better than the person I am dealing with, I only care that we all do well after the deal.
---
this is where you're wrong
---
a group dps of a little bit over 17k is enough to kill the Boss in time to get atleast one chest out fo the 3  
---
10 ppl pressing one with full nomad gear should reach around 16k on most classes  
---
a single ranger with iboga as pet can easily reach 4k by pressing 1 and the gear doesn't even matter  
---
most ppl run gear with way better potential to deal dmg  
---
there is not a single person which wont be able to do this if said person brings an lvl 80 char
---
Edit: if exactly everyone run full nomad gear then you can't do it (with only pressing 1) if you don't have atleast 1 ranger  
---
but wait we talk about open world almost everyone plays ranger there lul.....  
---
this group does not exist if you don't make it one  
---
&gt; they oriented themselves on the lower end of the ten-times difference of  damage between organized players and those just bumbling through the  game having fun. 
---
as beeing said around 17k is enough to do the Boss in time and organized group can reach around 250k  
---
this isn't the lower end this is a joke.
---
This is challenging solo content or beginner friendly content for 5ppl but for 10??????
---
&gt; The vast majority of people I see at open worlds events like the current release won't make it to the boss 
---
cause they can't find the entrance?
---
&gt;  less alone kill it. 
---
haha no... as beeing stated they can
---
&gt; These are very well challenged. 
---
the jumping puzzle maybe
---
&gt; People that use reddit to discuss tactics and development? Yeah...no. 
---
you need a tactic to press 1? No? then you don't need a discussion either!!
---
TL;DR: pressing 1 is enough to kill it!! everyone can do it

The icon for clearing a mission with bonus, by chance?

The box for them refers specifically to the Ebon Vanguard, but the pin on the scarf looks more like the emblem from the Blood Legion flag to me? Either way, I'm really excited to try and get these.

---
Your comment emphasizes why Anet should not listen to people like you.
---
&gt; The Griff has the speed to match top speed Roller Beetle
---
Not just match, it has the highest speed
---
She is SUCH a good VA it kills me. Listening to how she's changed in tone over the years is super cool because it also feels like my sylvari is aging alongside her. Core vs now feels like such a stark difference.
---
Neither does Druid, but it gives other more useful stuff.
---
&gt;s: 1. This is literally the first mission which is meant to slowly introduce noobs to the mechanics which will eventually get harder as it goes on.
---
It. Will. Not. Won't. This is the intended difficulty of strike missions. And isn't supposed, was never supposed and will never be supposed to introduce anyone to anything. This is a way to provide "accessible" (to literally everyone and their dogs) raid-like content. It was clearly obvious to everyone way before this abomination came out,  yet people still made statements like yours. Now it is out, what else are we waiting for?
---
&gt; veteran top tier player that knows mechanics, their skills, and has probably raided before
---
Omg, he read his skills, and maybe even raided before!  Does that mean that he is worth 5 to 10 "players" strike missions are aimed for? Do you aknowledge yourself as 1/10th of a player who actually read his skills? Do you agree to be treated as such?
---
Here's the problem with statements like these. ANet (from my understanding) never intended for players to have to "learn" a rotation or have optimized builds. This is a community expectation, and from speaking to the guilds I've been in, one that is mostly prevalent in Raiding PUGs, Speedrunners, and Hardcore Raid Guilds..... all of which form the minority of Raiders, let alone a minority in the game.
---
"Challenging content" != players need to learn to run the meta/optmized build/rotation/gear for raids. That was never ANet's intention. Yet, that's what players want ANet to do, cater to how this minority group within the raid community want all players to raid.
---
I played the Strike mission last night. I find it a great intro to raid-style encounters.... especially if this mission is going to evolve/get new modes after each release for some time. It makes it iterative and easier for players to digest. This was never meant to be a "OK, you're ready to go after one encounter". If it was too hard, it would be ignored as much as raids and fractals are by the general player base.
---
Skyscale is closer to 200g
---
She is hands down the reason that i purchased 8 new character slots and remade all of my toons as female sylvari
---
I mean there are definitly plenty of good achievement systems.
---
Usually the ones that give you rewards for doing something you might not have otherwise done. Like EU4 often times gives you an achievement to do something with a small nation (like Yemen to controll a bunch of coffee) that you otherwise would not have done. And for big nations it gives you other challenges (like expanding super quickly with France).
---
You can also make use of sheets own caching service for mats and bank tabs, as they won't change for every single mat you're requesting.
---
Like so: https://pastebin.com/2ncvqdqX
---
Lol no
---
Yay another thing to enter to not win v.v
---
At first. Anet promised that we'll never get specific roles (dps, tank, healer, etc) and that everyone will be able to perform every role.
---
Then HoT came along and due to raids, we got a choice to have these roles, though some professions were pretty good at multiple roles, but they weren't proficient at multiple simultaneously. Anet doesn't like this, they saw the core professions and how they were significantly weaker than the elite specs.
---
The elite specs are apparently a gimmicky name to mean "exclusive". From what I've gathered, the power creep is what was making it more difficult for Anet to balance the game for hardcore and casual players.
---
Give the exact build to both these types of players and you'll get wildly different results.
---
So an affordable solution for this is to make trade offs on every elite spec. This is to ensure that balancing for new content will be easier and reduce the gap between new players and veterans. 
---
And as far as scrapper goes, this spec has been through a LOT over the past few years, so much so that I honestly feel the original design was the best, the first rework being the worst and this new design being a middle ground, decent but not great.
---
This is a good tip and you are being downvoted like crazy. Ouch.
---
yeah, just more boring ass living world episodes for another year, maybe two, maybe three? who knows  
---
also breaking news, casuals dont want to fight things, they enjoy not having to even press the skill 1 button, nice
---

---
i stated that allready above in detail  
---
dmg wise pressing 1 is enough to kill it
---
let's compare that to tequatl (first phase before split) as u/Ephemiel mentioned:  
---
pressing one is enough as well  
---
need to ress ppl way more often than you will on the strike mission  
---
on tequatl you actually need to leave the poison fields on the strike mission well no
---
and then we have the only mechanic that could wipe a group in a strike mission the big aoe past 50% that does like 90% dmg to a person that has no toughness which can easily be delt with by pressing F
---
oh wait so far that's only the attack group for tequatl we haven't even looked at the scale mechanic  
---
or the deff/repair mechanic for the cannons
---
difficulty wise even the attack group on tequatl has a harder time than anyone has doing the strike mission.
---
&gt; During this fight I suggested stay close but still we had a deadeye who  stayed far for "better dps" and a guardian who cannot dodge the half  area aoe even if it was really slow. 
---
so what if that's only 1 person who cares  
---
if that's everyone you still can ress them it's not like they instantly die..... pressing F is hard it seems  
---
&gt; Try doing some public run and you'll understand which is the current actual level 
---
done that multiple times never failed not even got close to not get all 3 chests......  
---
What is your point exactly?
---
I would love this if it weren't for the massive pauldrons...
---
&gt; This one doesn't even have defiance bars. 
---
Eh ... those are overused and feels kinda lazy anyway
---
They've been juggling entire skills in and out of the class every few months since beta, why would you think they have a goal in mind for engi?
---
2 days in, and I have just a few left. Probably going to be returning for weeks just for the strike mission and the 15 dailies for that one ach, and then onto more profitable locations. This map is relaxing, but I'm already at a point where I'm afk'ing while waiting for events to cycle around
---
I really wish Braham's voice actor did a better job with sounding like a charr, was very immersion breaking to hear his voice every time. Especially when he was drunk dialing you at the same time one of his Charr characters were speaking next to you.
---
Precisely because they are overused they should be used in strikes too, to get people more used to them.
---
So you caught a moment when you didnt find a squad? The other day after  filtering out the selling groups there were so many LFGs, that I had to scroll on a 1440p monitor.
---
If you dont find a group, try again later, or just create one yourself.
---
Thank you for posting this. The scrapper needs a lot of help and the current changes don't make any sense. Need more traits for wells, need gyros improved, need more ways to generate barrier if they want us to barrier tank, etc.
---
Yeah, in Central Tyria. Meanwhile, I've been doing hearts for ages in Istan for the 3000+ kralkatite I need for Vision. It's not fun. I want it to be over. I run around pressing F on things and pretty much ignore the rest of the map, it's not engaging gameplay either.
---
Relogging fixes this bug.
---
Its a combat tonic
---
Thanks for posting it here! :)
---
Not really long chains of dialogue but lots of little bits. Some really interesting stuff imo :)
---
This has some spoilers because there are certain dialogue conversations that only trigger when you complete the story.
---
Pssst. Your gems will be sent in a couple of minutes.
---
You really should begin to understand that having a wrong opinion and being called out on it doesn't mean someone has a hateboner, but of course, understanding that would mean understanding you're wrong in the first place and we can't have that, ANet can do no wrong after all.
---
Better to double check ... make sure you don't have a d3d9.dll file in your GW2 folder or the bin64 folder inside of it.
---
I was killing the embers that I spawned for the lupi fight

Revenant is good for PvE in Alacrigade and decent PvP with hammer, IIRC.
---
A good spy should be able to blend in ...
---
These three physical chests spawn everytime you finish the mission?
---
They do , you just don’t get the wiggly ones
---
Regarding fracs or raids - it all depends on your goals. If you just want to chill with friends, do the content for fun at comfortable pace with the class which you personally enjoy - go for it. But there are other people, who prefer to do content in fast and optimal way. This is the point of meta. You have a set composition, which covers all the aspects that need to be covered, you have roles, which implicitly assume certain duties. Provided players are good at their classes, this can lead to sub-hour CMs+T4+Recs run, which almost does not require an explicit coordination. As I progressed through the kp ladder, I noticed that at some point you stop seeing any variety in builds. You almost always get a DH or weaver, occasionally a soulbeast or power chrono. That's because after doing the runs hundred or more times, you tend to go for what works best.
---
However, if you join no-kp T4 group, you're not guaranteed to have a like-minded group. You might see people who want to chill or play for fun, or "meta-whores" who'd laugh and kick your scrapper. Both have the right to play the way they want. We, as community, just have not found a reliable way to get the people we need.
---
I haven't checked but the other issue with the Elonian guy is that he sometimes ask for stuff he is standing next to or running up to.
---
I've always disliked the abundance of boring minis in this game.  Like, did we really need a mini for each named Sunspear?  Otherwise I like the minis... except that the Springer Kits suffer from the same slow-hopping phenomenon that the adult Springer mini launched with.
---
Not even close. I mostly played group WvW with guilds; occasionally commanding for pugs as well. And for group play in an organised manner, warclaw wasn't an improvement either. But what do I know about the woes of the poor pug trying to stay on tag?
---
You having it out for me is not going to do you any good in the long run, mate. This is not the place for personal crusades.
---
How is Firebrand the highest DPS in the game right now?  Can you link to a build please?
---
It's tied for griffin in terms of engage damage, and it also will, under most circumstances, do its damage faster. 
---
That's the only reasonable thing I can think to use it in PvE outside of just fun.
---
I wish they would decrease mob density and instead just make the fights more difficult and impactful. I also loved the HOT metas while the pof ones outside of vabbi are just laughable honestly [imo]
---

/u/BoyC  Do you think we can get this type of Day/Night clock thing added to TacO, but in game so we know when actual day and night is.. so we can take advantage of things like [superior sigil of the night](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Sigil_of_the_Night)?

---
What's upsetting you dear? If you want we can talk about it.
---
I feel like CC is an easier and more obvious way of reducing one's DPS.
---
Much better than face tanking millions of hits with protection in Nightmare CM. 
---
I still think that it needs more mechanics, but it is the first one, after all.
---
dont you see the Problem in "laughing and kicking"
---
or in comments like "laughable dps" (when its totally acceptable), or "you play with shit players".
---
its this elitism, this arrogance that really drives me crazy. Well if those guys want to be "the best" then they should just find their group of five/ten and dont bother us players who play in a different yet working way.
---
The boss timer already has a track for day/night. Isn't that good enough? A specialized widget can be made of course.
---
We should have let Balthazar kill Kralk and explode Tyria
---
They said that the bosses would upgrade. It could very well be that this easy strike isn't its true power. Its possible this isn't the whole fight, but only a single phase of the fight.
---
For the "introduction to raiding" is in the "introduction to the format and general feel of raids" rather than "difficulty stepping stone".
---
Given that most of the vocal raiders already find raids easy and that this was to be easier why is everybody so surprised and upset that it is indeed just easier. Like some of the current raid bosses have already been solo'ed it only makes sense that this si possible especially when the recommended party size provided by Anet starts at 5.
---
Damn, surprised there isn’t more chilly chairs on the TP.
---
I solo'd the Testing Golem within a couple hours of its release.
---
Very fun duo, well worth the trip to EU
---
then you will have to hope there's enough supply for everyone and also hope it's not seasonal. people purchase things in season to sell in the off season while supply is low. take that out and the price will skyrocket &gt;.&gt;; but once everyone has already unlocked the item (think common dyes) the price will tank super hard.
---
No, not really.
---
Detection Pulse is WAAAAY better than the Chemical Field.
---
Hahah what a nice little detail.
---
Honestly I worry that they watched WPs video where he said that chemical field really isn‘t useful and he‘d like detection pulse back... like dude, no pls don‘t say stuff like that.
---
Is Pure of Voice actually used over other Honor grandmasters? I mean if you would be going Honor you are already support or sustain, so Force of Will is a much stronger option for support in WvW and PvE while Writ of Persistence is superior in PvP and PvE for sustain and AoE coverage. Guard has much better cleanse options available if they need cleanse anyway.
---
Warclaw Is the only way for a casual to reach the commander at the other side of the map when he is not in squad cause it is full . Without it was just a moving target for enemies to be ganked
---
I don't have it out for you, you just happen to be the one that posts the dumbest white knight posts like this one and it catches the eye.
---
&gt;not going to do you any good in the long run, mate
---
Why? Because you and the rest of the white knights will continue to abuse the report system in order to silence me? If anyone has a personal crusade here, it's you people who report the ones that prove you wrong.
---
It'd actually be nice if the strikes did this, and make more sense as a stepping stone. If over time they slowly make more challenging strikes available, then it actually will be good raid training, because you'll have a sort of progression of difficulty that eases you into raid level content.
---
I just want the Aurene shirt, I don't want the wireless headphones.
---
I don't know think taking a 68-hour perspective from a distance is representative of how people participate in this sort of thing.  It seems unlikely that someone with 0 Spirit Shards, 0 karma, 0 materials, 0 map completion, and 0 Obsidian Shards is going to start down this path, much less complete it.
---
Instead, this sort of thing seems better suited to players who already have 80% or more of what's needed.  So for them that 68 hours probably drops down to 10 or so, which is is more appealing and profitable for a lot of people.

---
I'm responding to you here since the gatekeepers shitcanned the post you responded to earlier.
---
The weight of the toolbelts actually is important.
---
If we keep your currency metaphor then it could be argued that for PvE the field has value of $1.00 and the pulse has a value of $0.00. For PvP the pulse may have a value of $0.75 and the field a value of $1.00. Respectively, for group-organized WvW the field may have a value of $0.75 but the pulse does not have a value of $1, it had a value of $100. It's uninteresting to compare those two options over the different modes because when looking at their value you need to compare them to everything else that is available on the class or build. At a specific subset and time the detection pulse was one of the most valuable things on the entire class. It was the reason that the class had any representation at all in the gameplay.
---
Then of course, that gameplay is pretty marginalized today (being only a portion of a game mode that is only a portion of the playerbase) but it does exist and provides value beyond it's existance.
---
Since then more support has obviously been built into the class and it has a stronger role today but detection pulse remain so much more valuable to WvW than what the poison field is to any build in any mode - I mean it clearly isn't as important as your mainhand weapon in either of those two modes or the builds you're talking about, right? For organized WvW it has been. Losing it was a devastating blow, not a minor inconvenience. That makes these comparisons insulting. It makes them especially insulting if you factor in how often PvE-centric balance changes cascade negatively into WvW and how seldom WvW-centric balance changes cascade negatively into any other mode. Comparing how often that occurs is also downright insulting and what drove me to make my first comment. That the pulse has little to no value at all in PvE can be read already in the doodle.
---
People couldn't find the heal button during downstate
---
I wonder if they might make each strike mission in the saga progressively harder, so that we end up with a series of 6-7 strike missions of increasing difficulty for people to play around with.
---
This one might just be to get casual folks used to the system, then they'll see the harder version of the construct in the EP 1 map, and the bosses get more difficult from there, so we have a gradation of mini-raids built around the saga.
---
i wrote 200 not 250 at first  
---
but even then 10 times is a commonly used phrase for a lot more dmg not exactly 10 times more
---
for example if you run power gear on a weaver and compare a propper rotation to just pressing 1 then you will realise that press 1 still gives you more than 25% of the dmg of a propper rotation
---
even 17k compare to 20k does not work out like not at all
---
I really enjoyed this aspect too. I hope we see more maps that allow players to just explore and enjoy everything.
---
Don't you lose your eligibility if you use a portal? It even states so at the buff.
---
It's one way to get back to the commander. Other methods are regrouping appropriately, waiting for respawn or moving alongside other respawns and defending yourself. If your commander is bullying enemies on the other side of the map, overall your side is winning and staying alive is considerably easier.
---
It also changes the rate at which both sides get reinforced. This forces even fights onto areas closer to the center of the map as the difference in speed at which the defenders are reinforced is significantly increased. Given the layout of the maps this limits the places you can fight and the dynamic of fights; especially in objectives.
---
It also allows defenders, when they mass numbers or momentum to chase down anyone within their area without much threat. Further allowing defense to rely on siege and numbers without risk and promoting attackers to avoid even fights because they are inherently in a disadvantage. This leads to only being proactive on the map when you're significantly stronger than the enemies due to pop or skill inbalance.
---
But you're comparing rotations and whatnot. Anet has most likely compared under completely different circumstances. They may assume green gear or several pieces of Shaman's on a power build or whatever.
---
I'm just saying that Anet's calculated gap kind of fits in the whole thing which would be an indicator that they designed the whole thing around that gap.
---
I hoping it is, and the thought first entered my head when somebody reminded me of the Matthias fight in Salvation Pass. Ice Phase (first phase) was ridiculously easy. Fire Phase was a bit harder with the flaming tornadoes and the red poison AoE. Then came Rain phase making everything hellish. Then came final phase where everything goes crazy.
---
Or switch to other map
---
Exactly.  I had a feeling the LS maps were consistently empty and have not done current LS maps so oh well, no need to do any of that now.
---
Nothing pisses me off more than roaming around in zerk gear and get one shotted by a fucking angry shroom. It's a good change of pace!
---
Tome on FB are quite usefull too on solo.
---
Did you try Quickbrand instead of FB dps with some quickness ? You don't lose to much dps and bring more quickness for both of you. It's perhaps a quite fair trade I think.
---
Sorry to say, but this post will be just down vote fodder.  I totally agree with you though, the overreaction is real.
---
Ya it's overclocked, game works better with faster single core speeds.
---
As long as he doesn't talk like Braham I don't really care, been several Charr who have sounded like humans throughout the game, especially female Charr. Just use your own voice with a bit of growl.
---
I feel like this first strike is meant to introduce the idea of a very, very soft DPS check for people in the form of the bonus chests. And the ability to tune out visual noise in order to find the pattern that lets you cut through the boss mechanics. It's also their first step toward automatic matchmaking infrastructure for this kind of content.
---
Right now it is really easy to complete this strike with a random pug group, but it's still possible you run into groups which do not have the DPS to reach all of the bonus chests. Yeah, you can solo/lowman to complete, but there is a DPS check to reach those bonus chests.
---
There's also a lot of visual noise to the fight which might be new for some players to deal with. At the very least, this fight shows the value of stacking up together as a group as opposed to trying to stay at max range to afkpewpew. It actively punishes you for trying to position further out with a few hard hitting attacks. Experienced players are familiar with the concept of stacking, but if you go to any open world event you can see most players are not. More importantly: **You are greatly rewarded for identifying the pattern of attacks** in the form of trivializing the fight. That's the core concept of a raid boss; once you understand it, you can exert mastery over it. This one is definitely easy to identify and capitalize on, but it's still a good concept to reinforce in players.
---
And finally with the automated matchmaking... I think there's definitely room for improvement on this system (such as creating a /team for players joining or allowing you to enter with a partial squad rather than solo port each of you when you use this system). It's good to see some headway in this direction, though.
---
***
---
As far as babby's first raid goes: Yeah, this is *really* easy for anyone who has already participated in any kind of endgame content be it Fractals or Raids. I expect future strikes to start adding more failure states into the mix with things like tanking aggro, arena/aura damage, mechanical roles (cannons/greens kind of thing), etc.
---
Anet is aware of the issue of introducing DPS checks and I think the bonus chest system is a good approach to it, but it's not enough on its own. I'm hoping we eventually see some kind of improvements towards helping players learn how to gear their characters properly and not just going in with whatever they've got. To help players become aware of better builds for their designated roles and if there is going to be LFG public matchmaking / funneling that it enforces some kind of gear/build check to serve that role.
---
[Maybe this will help you realize why that won't work well](https://youtu.be/SeHfxzm_X3Q)
---
I mean, it's been like this for 3 years at least. I can't remember the last time I saw a legitimate group on there.
---
I think you really need to stop playing GW2 for a while and focus more on your life or on the other games you play. This post history is incredibly sad.
---
It also was nerfed twice I think as people were complaining if was too hard and it’s still considered too hard
---
Yup and the rework buffed it in pve. Berserk was bad/meh in pvp and wvw before the rework and still is after so overall things got better not worse.
---
I wasn't sure if that was it or not.  It was kind of cool during the speech part cause it gave it a sense of scope, but it sucked on on that event big time.
---
Like I said, he could have just used his normal voice with a bit of growl and it would easily pass.
---
The skyscale will get you high, but the griffon will get you far.
---
They were given a quest from Glint, but they were no servants, just willing collaborators.
---
Eh, I've heard him try it before. It's not great.
---
If it's sellable or account-bound it makes no difference since it can't be a prestige item because strikes are trash so far as difficulty.
---
Dhuum bench says hello.
---
It not like OP gave any spoilers. He's simply telling people that there is an achievement that could be a lot more work if you don't get it the first time through.
---
A lot of people who would normally not use a guide might change their mind if they know what extra work it'll cause them.
---
Ye sounds tricky if unplaned, I managed mine with almost them spliting up.
---
Y'know what dude, thats fair.
---
Yes. However, it's been nerfed over and over again. Remember when AB south took actual work? Or even further, remember launch Orr?
---
At this point it doesn't even matter. Mounts break any semblance of difficulty even further adding an escape from any fight.
---
Lol get out hahaha.
---
Imagine this:
---
You get back to character creation. Personal story gets reset, and you create a lv1 of any race, just like a brand new one. 
---
Map completion should stay, but if it's a tech limitation it may be reset as well.
---
Birthday stays the same, inventory stays the same (you keep any extra bag slots you have). Equiped stuff gets removed and mailed to you; thats a few mails: one for armor, one for trinkets, one for weapons and one for breather + tools.
---
This also allows them to sell you name change / total makeover / identity repair / lv80 boost (maybe bundle some/all or make different packs).
---
Do you really think they are not able to code that? I'm pretty sure they would sell well!!!
---
I could see it being like her going "welp, now dragons can't corrupt me" and just absolutely slaughtering every dragon minion she can find.
---
Mellitus does that as well.
---
&gt; but I would prefer to have some insight on the future of these glyphs limitations. Sadly - if there is no communication, then the items are not as advertised and I will be requesting a refund of all 15,000 gems - and I know many others that will be doing the same.
---
&gt; Awaiting a response...
---
If you want a response from Anet, contact CS and dont use reddit.
---
Just ask for a refund and if they change the way the glyph works, you can always buy the tools again.

All I can see is scourge is probably going to be one of the best farmers after FT/turret engineer.
---
Dhuum bench is even worse. You can even buy it at the vendor
---
good way to keep it popular
---
and the problem with rare and account bound is that people who don't want it get buried in a pile of it while the people who want it never sees it
---
Nice job, do you maybe have one without the text
---
Yeah its cool and it makes sense. There really wouldn't be loads of baddies in charr territory because they live for fighting so most enemies nearby would be cleared out.
---
It's a mix of ignorants unable to detect the real problem, plus fanboys defending every decision ArenaNet makes.
---
Perfect recipe for disaster.

Excactly, that is why the Chair was the only reason to do it at all.

You know you don't have to buy it. Its an option for those who do.

Not bad, logo over Jormag is a tad busy for my taste, but thanks!
---
There is also the value of the VM that the currency items can be turned into. I didn't bother factoring in the time since that gets a bit weird.
---
It's only good enough if you are already in the map and can look up there what events are soon in rotation, but when you are away say in LA then you have no way of knowing which one starts when.
---
If you need a specific one and want to do other things while waiting then it would be really great to know when said event begins.
---
The official raids kinda solved this by allowing to trade minis for currency. That would be a good middle ground.
---
I’m actually surprised there isn’t a Strike Reward NPC in fact.
---
It would be great if it was account bound  if RNG is not on your side. I have 184 Gorseval, 155 Xera and 130 Dhuum kp. No infusion, portal or bench drop. I bought the portal yesterday since I stopped raiding and my hope to get it dropped is dead.
---
Didn't notice but I have only done the event once and the chopping and grilling might help disguise that a bit more.
---
On the other hand there is no way for him to be catching stuff from 20 people anyway :p
---
now im having my sound cut out
---
Nah, hard disagree! I much prefer strikes, bosses,  fractals, raids, to drop items that are able to be sold. t’s adds another reason to farm them, and excitement to drops.
---
Open world exploration in any game is its own metric. Difficulty for open world is determined by the amount of planning required to get to your destination. Sure, the mobs aren't like raid trash pulls, but there is still an element of risk and planning in how you navigate. I meant, what do you expect, a Dark Souls level of difficulty when it comes to navigating the open world? Sure, by that metric, HoT wasn't hard. But that's an entirely different style of game. I would definitely say HoT launch provided enough challenge in both mob and map design to be classified as hard. Getting to the next waypoint required planning and strategy. Sometimes (many times), even after your 20th time navigating a certain path, you'd die if you were running solo. 95% of the builds at the time didn't allow you to just charge in blindly while watching anime with subs and eating cheetos. It was definitely hard for open world content. It was perfect for hard difficulty in open world. Ofc, it was then nerfed to the ground. I'd say it's medium now. It's still harder then vanilla. But once you add mounts, everything becomes easy.
---
Except Ash Legion, since you can't find them if you're not also Ash Legion.
---
I'll hunt down his screenshot just for you xx &lt;3
---
Advice: leave em; they aren't worth staying for.
---
She's gonna end up in a relationship with one of them or lead someone on and it'll be a mess and then no more guild.
---
Just leave.
---
Yes.
---
The fact that he's called Mellitus made me outright laugh out loud, especially because my blood sugar has been a pain in my ass lately.
---
Even the keys for the Vault can be sold, which defeats the purpose of gaining them through events.
---
Nope. Not even a little bit.
---
...? Where's the gender inequality here?
---
but i...  
---
okay.    
---
:(
---
Then put the next shade on your feet???? God forbid you have to predict a spike coming. And make sure you hit allies. 
---
Scourge also still has its larger barrier on its heal skill. Giving a class the opportunity to bomb, buff/cleanse allies and grant barrier on both at range and on their feet at the same time is bad game design. As it is in game now, every scourge can whiff their entire shade bomb and still deny the area around them because of the cleave. There's zero risk in throwing out a bad shade. All this will do is make spellbreakers more important in the meta and promotes them staying in the ball to counter pushes
---
This, so much this. Cut your losses and move on. Stay in touch with those that you like but this guild will not last.
---
Interesting stuff, and a good showing of how the Charr are divided on the whole peace with the other races. And a nice touch with the Norn finishing it off with the moot comments. XD
---
There's also a corrupted scepter and a Black Lion Focus in his office.
---
Oh wow I had no idea
---
blanket statements and why they aren't good.
---
Chapter 1 is the first evolution of the icebrood construct. The presentation indicated the model and mechanics of the boss will evolve for chapter 1 and at that point we'll also get a second strike for the Boneskinner
---
I think your argument makes sense, as the loss of Detection Pulse in WvW had a much bigger negative impact on the game mode than the loss of Chem field would have on either PvE or PvP.
---
But the thing is, we don't have to even be talking about this, because at a certain point in time, not too long ago, GW2 players had access to Detection Pulse via Sneak Gyro.
---
It was ANET's decision to remove it and replace F5 with Function Gyro.  This was a terrible decision.  It was terrible then. It is terrible today. It will be terrible tomorrow.  It was their attempt to shoehorn this idea of "elite specs" having a tradeoff, not recognizing that the loss to Scrappers was a unique Toolbelt ability that cannot be accessed by Core Engys anyways.
---
This change must be reverted.  End sentence.  I have no issue with their concept of a trade-off by taking elite specs, this was just a piss-poor way to do that.  What they did to Daredevil steal with Swipe was awkward; what they did with Scrapper was just plain foolish.
---
And now, because they are not willing to admit this was a foolish change, PvE, PvP and WvW are all going to lose out on Chemical Field.  How important that is doesn't really matter, since this DIDNT HAVE TO HAPPEN.  Had ANET made a better choice in trying to find a trade-off, everything else would have been fine.
---
So we shouldn't have to debate who lost more / who gains more with this change, because this change should just be reverted in the first place and let ANET come up with some other idea as a trade off for picking Scrapper.
---
18% .\_. You killed me with this number, I almost didn't believe it, but I checked it and apparently you're right, so it stays .\_.  
---
I don't know why I have this feeling of femShep actually being significant in the fandom then. Everywhere I look there's her and *so little* of the male version. And not only Pinterest, which of course adjust its content to what I browse. Fan content is literally flooded with the female version.  
---
\[To be honest I wonder how many people play a game (not only this game, but any game) and stay with it, and how many people play it once and don't return. When you take away one-timers who knows, maybe the numbers change. But after all, who am I to say who is a fan and who's not ༼•͟ ͜ •༽\]  
---
But I still stick to what I said - Hale did make a change, even if not as... significant one as I thought... And every single time someone tries to play the opposite gender for a change, I believe it's a good thing.
---
Love the artstyle! 
---
What brushes did you use, did you make them yourself?
---
but Holo is also better in PvP, hello?
---
I do not miss enemies that knock me down by running 2 meters away from me, or archer frogs that are completely immune to projectiles for no reason.
---
But do you enjoy the story? Personally, I find that the first time I play new content, if I focus too much on achievements, I enjoy the content less. So now I make a conscious effort to not look at achievement buffs when I'm playing a new release.
---
The community is pretty good at eventually learning metas. Auric Basin requires much more than 5 people to know what's going on. Once people learn the meta they retain the knowledge.
---
You're right that people can join these and mindlessly zerg them as long as enough people are doing it. They're still fun though. I think one of the keys of a well designed meta event is having required activities that a subset of the zerg will have to do. It would be too frustrating if everyone had to do a mechanic.
---
The real 1 spam is stuff in core tyria like world bosses.
---
I find that kind of attitude amongst raiders, WvW'ers, etc. very disingenuous. Sure, do those modes offer a much higher level of challenge on average then the average PvE meta? Absolutely. On average, your description of what a PvE meta is could apply. That doesn't devalue what those best meta's did upon release. They provided consistent failstates, that in some cases still apply today. Release DS still remains an absolutely unique gaming experience to this day. Unfortunately, it, along with the rest of HoT, got nerfed along with the addition of mounts just making navigating a joke. The praise I have for it barely applies now.
---
-
---
I mean just look at karma farming in WvW. It's just as much of an easy mode. Does it mean all of WvW is easy? No. But it does mean that there are easier aspects of WvW. Just how there are some challenging aspects of PvE open world meta's.
---
You're so brave!
---
&gt; Everything you're talking about is relevant to WvW. I think the change is fine for WvW. My proposed addition to the change makes it not a nerf for PvE and PvP.
---
IF there was a way to change the damage in WvW only I'm sure they would.  To my understanding if it was just a damage coefficient, they can split that between modes, same as duration or cooldown.  But this sounds like they are changing how the ability works, and that can't be split afaik.
---
Oh, Texas
---
Holo is more DPS oriented, scrapper is a bunker. They have different purposes, Holo is mainly better than scrapper not because of the specs themselves, but because FB is here. Being a really strong bunker and an awesome support throw away all the other bunker/supports right now.
---
My point was the current strike mission boss doesn't have any. Not relevant ones, in any case.
---
Thanks :D
---
This, and being stuck in combat for seemingly no reason. The oneshot shadow scales that were untargetable. The hero points that impossible to solo for an average player. Poison, knock downs, chak, chak FUCKING CHAK.
---
Man now that I think about it, why the shit did I even suffer through those maps. For some blues and greens as rewards? I'd sooner drag my balls over a cheese grater.
---
They mentioned that this first one will get boss transformed when chapter 1 arrives. So I guess we are now in beta time window to catch up the rest of possible bugs and then we will get full strike unleashed.
---
HoT does a fairly good job of having enemies with mechanics you have to work around.  
---
Problem is, they're also overtuned or don't have enough counterplay, and the veteran level enemies magnify those missteps.   
---
If they built in better limitations, the HoT zones could be *so* good.
---
Because they be dealin with karmawhores like you
---
Thank you for the table, that helps me understand your point a lot better.
---
Look, I don't think anyone would complain about Hammer doing more damage in PvE.  But the same question needs to be asked about so many other weapons.  Why does Hammer for Warrior still suck in PvE? Or Longbow? Or Rifle?  Guardian Hammer and Longbow? 
---
Why hasn't ANET adjusted those.  Can it be they think the damage for those weapons is fine?  You're guess is as good as mine.
---
I wouldn't object to Rev Hammer doing more DPS in PvE (not sure about PvP though tbh), but I wouldn't hold my breath =(
---
Get some of the vm gathering tools, there's a lot of nodes to gather and thus a ton of vm.
---
"Mini raid" could have been the internal name before "strike missions" but left for coding purposes.  The CM part is some hype they should have mentioned though.  Maybe its meant for the next episode.
---
Sureeee.  That's why.... Any proof?
---
What "sous chef quest" are you talking about? I'm intrigued.
---
When he says coconut.....ooofta
---
if i would have known i was gonna get a ban i would have taken screenshots of map chat.
---
&gt;So anet made raids the most challenging content ever put into gw2 pve and didnt expect players to put in effort or min/max or search for and want to play with other like minded individuals?
---
Expect? Of course they expected players to do that, players always do. However, GW2/ANet have always been anti-elitist and min/max playstyles are extremely elitist and hardcore. Most challenging != min/max. Knowing the encounter and having a good viable build that you know how to play *is* what the mode was designed for..... NOT just for those that want to clear raids fast.
---
Knowing the encounter is far more important than having a crazy strict rotation.
---
&gt; We have had living world bosses that punish harder.
---
Thanks for reminding me Caudecus on his release. This was the first and last time I literally become naked when facing some boss.
---
The spelling and grammar of a 9 year-old didn't help much either.
---
Support should message you letting you know the reason behind the ban
---
With the final boss achievement, you can also just stand inside it, same with the strike mission.
---
Shit no.
---
Can't wait for the new "behind the voice" episodes. They're awesome. Hope Anet didn't drop the idea.
---
&gt; the idea of coming back to the map after every reset to get the one lucky drop is much more appealing in a game where cosmetics matter as much as in gw2.
---
But it completely loses its appeal, once you got that lucky drop because a 2nd lucky drop would be worthless to you.
---
But fear not, the new infusion just dropped and already there are 18 buy orders for 10k gold each, so there you got your carrot to come back every reset.
---
ive been waiting but haven't gotten any emails yet.
---
No no, honey.  Actually, you were insanely racist in your map chat conversations.  I reported someone talking about something similar, but using very racist language (using common pejorative terms for asian people) and typical stupid stereotypes (something about "things" being small or whatever).
---
You're entitled to your sense of humor, but not on a semi-public map chat.  Its annoying, its rude, and its offensive.  Personally, I think a 7 day ban isn't enough, though I do hope you decide to keep those kinds of tasteless comments to just your dinner table in the future, and not subject the rest of us to your racism.
---
You can't really go back. They nerfed the difficulty of the HoT maps through the floor long ago. We literally cannot go back to the 'difficult HoT' experience.
---
Being playing gw for about 2-3 weeks and tried everything beside raid. And tbh i just miss a place where i need to coordinate or play with people. Doing meta, map event, fractal (tier1) etc is all new following and have no idea wtf am doing or why am even bothering.
---
I playd gw2 for almost 6-7 years, and every high end content should be done in a group where we had to coordinate.
---
So is it LES05 or is it a Saga? *shrug*
---
Yeah infusions aren't bound by equipping. Unless of course this is a first.
---
I'm not sure....I had the meta done before hand
---
It's beautiful. Thank you for sharing!
---
Bye, I guess...
---
i have a feeling that some one who doesn't care about infusion have acquired it, without ascended armor and they will keep it in their bank for weeks until they realize how much it's worth
---
&gt;you guys focused on that hearts hate with huge autism
---
Thanks.
---
It sounds like the same concept of the Forest Spirit in Princess Mononoke.
---
Thanks for listening!
---
um i didn't say that i only said Chinese government and Asian architecture and how the Chinese government would block a cantha expansion that and the Chinese client of gw2 was pay to win. what map did this dude you reported say this in?
---
Sigh...
---
They're already touching revenant hammer. I'm not adding anything to their work they're already doing to it. I'm just asking for them to change one number that they're already changing. I'm not creating an additional balance change out of thin air.
---
I'm not saying "Hey, rev hammer is underperforming, please buff it." I'm saying "Hey, rev hammer is underperforming, here's how you could make this change without nerfing it."
---
Also, that's a whataboutism. It's the starving kids in Africa argument, it doesn't really make sense. We're not talking about all underperforming weapons, they are not in danger of getting nerfed further. Revenant hammer is facing the imminent threat of being nerfed while it's already bad.
---
you find him by following the trail when he shoots and you dodge the trail of death by 'gasp' not walking into it. Also there's literally a mastery that lets you see the invisible enemies as a reward for doing stuff in the expansion.
---
I totally missed that! That's really cool!
---
bye be careful what you say about the Chinese government though be safe.
---
I’ve been having a novelty box sitting in my bank for over a year. I’d like an instrument. The latest update made me interested in the bass guitar.
---
However I’ve had people tell me that the best option was the harp since there is less delay or something with the notes. Is it true or they’re all the same?
---
\&gt; i also talked about how anet might skirt around a cantha expansion by saying its just generic Asian architecture to try and not get in any trouble with china.
---
...Do you even get what the problem supposedly was? Because this is like exactly the opposite of a diplomatic solution.
---
It's like if someone complained that you shouldn't have burgers and pizza in the same meal so you stuck them in a blender, gave them the puree, and called it "burgizza."
---
Kinda getting tired of the slayer achievements to be honest.  How many fans spawn compared to the amount of people at the concert event every time?  Feels like 500 is gonna take forever.
---
Forget the demolition derby, that's gonna take me a while, I only have 2 kills lol.
---
I tend to not spend my time in a game I'm playing ranting or whatever about something like that.   
---
I think I'll be fine.
---
Interesting that there is another reward track that simply called "Icebrood Saga" final chest offers choice of materials, whatever it is.. I guess devs will keep adding more stuff in, with future release. 
---
Just 1 chest per track, huh quite greedy Anet. ;)
---
Oh, I already tossed that secret sauce all over him!
---
And used to honey to sweeten things up.
---
Those things are called knock downs and evade frames and pretty much every class has access to both
---
The new ooze thing fails all the time. 
---
And people already saying it needs a nerf. 
---
W. T. F.
---
I heard it looks like winter heart same effect but just light orange color  not worth 500g
---
Is it better to build a leggy or buy one? The money I’ve spent so far is making me seem like it isn’t worth it to make it. =(
---
we also talked about mist of pandaria and how it was banned in china i said they could do that too have cantha banned in china as the Chinese player base was really small. i was only trying to make theoretical excuses for anet to make a cantha expac. weird but funny analogy though.
---
No proof of acquisitions and this sub is not a place to reach customer support and violates our rules in doing so so post is removed. 
---
The NA/EU version of GW2 is not available in china and not subject to any chinese censorship. GW2 in China is a completely separate game.
---
The mob difficulty in HoT was still much harder. Mobs, even post-nerf, can one-shot you. This is simply never the case in PoF. Even if their mechanics are pretty basic, like using aoe to kill a group of pocket raptors or not attacking the bubble chalk, each mob actually requires you to do SOMETHING other than just mindlessly autoattack them. Defiance bars in PoF are entirely optional and most of the mobs either do very little damage or attack very infrequently. The only good mobs are the harpies.
---
&gt; unless it looks like ass.
---
I don't think this is a factor that has stopped other infusions from being absurdly expensive.
---
You have 3 charges, no? Cant you drop one on you?
---
In pve it's pretty easy considering that shades have low cooldown.
---
the instructions on the site say to redeem your code via the black lion window ingame. however i can never find that option, i still go to the main website to redeem a code. am i missing something?
---
Charr rp
---
Remember last wintersday infusion, toyshell one. Initially price spiked to few k gold, but when people realize how shite that thing was, it plumet down to hundred g or so. 
---
Not shiny = bad.
---
You know what I miss Kithicor Forest. Level 1-10 newbie zone by day. Level 40+ deathtrap after nightfall.
---
yes, I noticed those as well as i used reward track potions to complete the one time grothmar valley reward track and the repeatable track that you can do afterwards right after patch.
---
Right now I could probably earn 10-20 of those Icebrood Saga chests per week. Even at 10 chests per week that would result in 100 map currency per week. This doesnt sound much and I can probably farm 100 chilis in a day or two in the new map but since the chest also seems to offer future map currencies, its a great opportunity to get farming new map currency before it releases.
---
Assuming epi 1 will release in 9 weeks or so in november, thats 900 of the new map currency right after you finish its prologue.
---
I found it really strange hearing Braham all over the place.
---
&gt;you don't spent time making it changeable
---
That's exactly what poorly design systems cause, good designs are generic by default.
---
We can always hope, and hope a bit more since we know they read the reddit.
---
I don't think its worthwhile even then.
---
Can't upvote enough.
---
Skill splits &amp; reworks on some skills/traits would solve so many more problems then just nerfing crap across the board.
---
I think they went from really "hard" to "annoying hard". There is nothing worse than things like floaty beetroots and sneaks from the upside down. And they are not hard to kill, they are annoying.
---
Also, mob density in many areas from PoF+ is way overboard. Dragonfall have this sorted out a bit better and new map is amazing. More mobs don't mean harder content anet. It means more buttonmashing and slower exploration.
---
in general, i have no problem with a couple of low droprate high value rng drops from map metas or other chests/events that cant be obtained via vendors to keep replayability value of the map. however, i think those items should be tradeable.
---
Wish I had hope left
---
Eh depends on the meta your in.
---
I tend to run into a crap load of condi so it helps allot.
---
Damn everybody has many gold. :(
---
The mechanic is to stay in the very center of the boss and ignore mechanics.
---
Never lose hope, hero.
---
This sounds to me like they set up the randomizer, noticed at some point that it was grilling water, and left it in because they were laughing to hard to implement a filter.
---
Probably would have been worth getting a player vo line saying "That's boiling. You want the water boiled."
---
The number of chests is time based. The faster you kill the boss, the more bonus chests you get. My first run with six others, not all of us on good builds, went in blind, and we still got 2/3 chests. 
---
Before getting to the boss there's the jumping puzzle with slippery slope, which I found more frustrating than the boss fight itself. However, as long as one person gets to the end a teleport option is made available for everyone to get there.
---
I got that on my Sylvari. I really like it lol.
---
Tybalt never struck me as the kind of charr that would leave his besties suffering.
---
&gt;*I thoroughly believe with all of my heart to the very core of my soul with every fiber of my being that you don't actually know what you're doing???* 
---
And this wasn't obvious during all the chronomancer "nerfs" a year ago that kept increasing chronomancer's dps?  This wasn't obvious after "Purity of Purpose" or all of the other idiotic things anet's done in the name of "balance?"  Of course they don't know what they're doing.  God forbid they admit that spending 5 minutes on a weekend balancing the game is not enough.  Their "solution" to "balancing" chronomancer was to throw up their arms in defeat before gutting signet of inspiration in one last lazy, "throw it at the wall and see what sticks" attempt because someone couldn't be assed to spend an extra 5 minutes coming up with something better.  The last time I played chronomancer was over a year ago now.  I keep meaning to try out the new signet of inspiration but I just can't.  I'd rather remember chronomancer as a team focused support spec than a "me" focused spec with some skills that benefit teams.  Because after looking over the new skill rotation, that's what it looks like it does.  If your teammates won't stand in the well, not your problem, it's entirely "me" focused now. 
---
What does "balance" even mean for anet?  Because whatever it is, it makes me nervous whenever I see the word next to something I enjoy because I don't know if it'll get buffed to ridiculousness, nerfed into obscurity, removed, reworked or something inbetween.  So is it really surprising at all that they'd do something like this to scrapper?  Can you genuinely, with a straight face, after years and years of anet doing this shit not just to Chrono, but other elite specs as well, say that *this* is what made you believe that anet doesn't know what they are doing?
---
The thumbnail image for Grothmar Valley in LFG is missing (honestly pretty funny placeholder image shows up there instead)
---
I'd love to have the option to toggle a Tyria clock (like how we can currently set our in-game clock to local or server time).
---
Mate, he sounds more like an Asura naturally. Absolutely no way would that work.
---
But current Scrapper as a bunker isn't a good bunker, what do you mean?
---
nice paradox
---
Thanks... I guess :D
---
i miss the organization needed to do meta event... at least the first months
---
It's the same effect but you get it when you sit on the chair
---
When they first mentioned strike missions I thought maybe this was a hint they were going to start pushing the difficulty back towards HoT. Could still be a long term goal of the saga to creat a jumping in point and start ramping up the difficulty with each episode... But probably not.
---
I didn't even notice the timer first time I did it. https://i.imgur.com/jXQBpHy.png So the 2nd bonus chest requires you to kill the boss in 4min or less.  
---
The jumping puzzle is annoying to me because of some platforms being slippery, but I got used to it quick.
---
Oh I'm not defending it. Just giving you the information.
---
I recommend you replaying Episode 2 and 6 of season 4.
---
&gt; Knowing the encounter and having a good viable build that you know how to play is what the mode was designed for....
---
A by product of knowing a encounter and having a good build is having a rotation and putting in effort to execute said rotation and the mechanics of a encounter. Gw2 does not need players to run the most min/max'd builds to clear content. It does how ever greatly benefit from putting the effort into understanding how the games benefits from working WITH your teammates vs playing for yourself. We all have a limited amount of time to play video games and there is nothing wrong with promoting and looking for teammates that put in the effort to clear content at a decent (or better) pace and in a reliable way (ie no wipes and quickish kills). 
---
&gt; Knowing the encounter is far more important than having a crazy strict rotation.
---
I get that someone might think the idea of a rotation is strict and it always has to be followed 100% of the time in all scenarios but that is not the case. The rotations posted on placed like snowcrows are there to show you the maximum potential of dps while hitting the golem and more importantly to help players understand where their dmg is coming from so when shit hits the fan the player can adapt to the situation/encounter.
---
I really enjoyed this map too. 
---
I am also hoping there will be a map where there is just a wall of enemies blocking areas of the map. You can either fly over them or storm your way through.
---
&gt; Or the spike-throwers that just vomit projectiles for three minutes while tracking your position for far longer than any block/evade/reflect can sustain while having a breakbar the size of Mordremoth?
---
I hate the bristlebacks well more of the mere fact that their spikes somehow travel over a rock and then down again, yet I am obstructed from killing the f'ing thing.
---
Rox is voicing crecia
---
Well I am AP Hunting and I collect pretty much everything that can be unlocked, so there is always stuff to do for me. In the end I need a target to aim at.
---
The Problem I have with this situation is that I always want to go the fastes path to my target and this time it is again the wallet (gold wallet not rl money).
---
Yes, RNG is a bad system but it keeps me busy. Best would be an hard to get Achivement like a Challenge Mode for this boss or some kind of Meta Achivement.
---
And braham is voicing all the charr race.
---
&gt; 3000+ kralkatite I need for Vision
---
And here is where true problem lies. The Kralkatite farm/conversion is what is fucked up... If they hadn't gone for 10/brick and 25/heart but instead had done 3/brick (like iron) and 5/heart then events would have felt like a valid alternative method of farming the currency... none of the other maps are an issue, because events and hearts feel equally rewarding.
---
The problem you are highlighting isnt about repeatable hearts, it is about the balance between rewarding static hearts and cycling events.
---
Every other map has a better split in their rewards. Just the sheer disproportionate scale of Istan's currency sink is what made you so angry about it.
---
I'm almost certain that LS4E1 was a test to see if currencies could be scaled to higher numbers/deeper sinks to see how the player base reacted, and it didn't go well so they went back to the lower values for the rest of the maps.
---
Why they didn't update/correct the Istan reward structure to match the rest before Vision came out, I'm not sure.
---
All or nothing released in January because it was delayed already and they probably didn’t dare to push even further to angry players even more
---
i find it peculiar that we haven't datamined what infusions would look like and stuff like that. is that kinda stuff possible? just curious.
---
Well today i had a Reaper with 3k dps in my T4 group. and i healed as a Scrapper. No wipes in Twilight Oasis. And in the other Fractals we didnt even have a healer.
---
So, Meta is just an illusion.
---
There is no rotation for scourge you should use as many shade skills as possible when bombing including f3, think about the fight and whats happening don't just use shit because well my rotation says I should use this now and don't not use shit because oh my rotation says not to use this skill so I better not use it yet. On a side note the barrier and damage have always hit 10 targets granted you were in melee distance with the scourge (not sure if you knew this but you didn't seem aware in the post so I just thought I would clarify that for you). The patch won't change anything except punishing bad players (which is always a good thing) by taking away their melee aoe that they can fall back on right now when they waste all their shades, but better players got a significant buff with being able to hit 10 people in both melee and ranged now which is absolutely ridiculous when the entire reason scourges have been busted for the last 2 years is because nothing compares to the 10 man aoe they have combined with the corrupts, and honestly the 10 man barrier as well you hit more often than you would think especially when you're pushing into groups. Anet is really missing the mark if they put these changes through with the 10 man aoe still in place, it honestly feels a lot like Scourge is in the beginning stages of being treated like Chrono where they keep giving it asinine nerf after nerf without actually touching the reason that its strong in the first place until the class is incredibly unfun even for people who enjoyed it in the first place but is still used anyway because of how strong it is.
---
It's very easy no matter what class you play as, as long as your not a healer or tank. You just need to learn the mechanic then its straightforward. All bosses in lws3 and 4 are like that too.
---
Yes, this was my point. It will punish bad shade management up to a point where eventually placing a shade will lead to you having 15 seconds incapability of not replacing that shade because the duration of the shade.
---
That means for the few seconds of value of shade being down, you lose support for 10 allies and expose yourself to massive weakness. This will mean placing shades down is not worth it, feet or not, it would be just better to use the AoE around you, that occurs if you have no shade down.
---
10 Targets on 1 location is also EASIER to hit 10 targets on than 5 targets on 2 location. And scourge will be too easy.
---
I know she's become close with the Olmakhan (has she officially joined them?), but I would think this meeting of the Legions would be a big deal for her/something she'd want to attend.
---
Lol! Oh good old Everquest. Really curious about Pantheon when it comes out.
---
But Olmakhans werent there either.
---
If you think that was just about the bad presentation you should go back and re-read some of those threads. The community was incredibly frustrated, stemming from an overall annoyance at the lack of information on certainly aspects, specifically the lack of information on PvP, WvW, and raiding. In other words, the more difficult aspects of this game. Why was the presentation so negatively viewed? Because instead of focusing on these things we got some story info and 15 minutes of advertising. If the community didn't care about the more hardcore aspects of the game, they wouldn't have been as incredibly upset. Yes, the community was upset about ArenaNets lack of communication. Communication on what? Harder aspects of the game, and the mythical "expansion level content". What is OP's post about? A diminishing of the harder types of open world content.
---
That's the thing. Enough time has passed and enough nerfs have happened that even this reasoning doesn't work anymore. There's plenty of incredibly cheesy and tanky builds that allow for HoT to be incredibly easy, and essentially steamroll it. You just need to go find it. There's a wealth of content in HoT, it can be easy for anyone. I wouldn't really classify HoT as hard anymore. Where even if you had the right set-up, you still needed to play strategically. It was, yes, but not anymore.
---
It's just really frustrating hearing people say this. The game is easy enough as it is, HoT was nerfed because people complained. To hear that people still think it's too difficult sets a very scary precedent. When you strip out any failstate from a game, what game is there left to enjoy? Why can't an open-world player expect atleast some difficulty in their open-world content, why must they be pigeonholed into smaller instances? There's not many open-world ar as left that still have a semblance of difficulty. The vast majority of open world is catered to the casual mindset, to hear that people want to take away what little is left is disheartening. Especially when that gap between someone who can and can't is just arbitrary.
---
Yep! My question above though is about WHICH Shiverpeaks pass chests drop it. Just the bouncy chests? Or do all auto-loot boss chests have the chance to drop? I only received bouncy chests on the first run of the day, so there’s no point in farming if those are the only ones that drop it.
---
Nearly quit after getting to HoT, felt like a hot mess after the core game. Tangled depths especially, where there's death around every corner and the map doesn't matter. Best part of that expansion was the finish.
---
&gt; Since it's an elite spec mechanic and a trade off it should just be invulnerable. 
---
This alone demands an explanation from ArenaNet why they made it complete garbage. It wasn't even that great to begin with and they somehow made it WORSE.
---
If you use cleave skills at range to drop grubs to ~30% health, then swap to melee and lure boss for killing blow, does that work?
---
I like this.
---
It's kind of astounding. Like they could have asked anybody who plays high-end fractals or raids on holo what effect that would've had. Anybody. Yet they made this change for PvP, and it ruined PvE.
---
I miss the difficulty of the first HoT Beta Story event, where we got to run the first story chapter in VB.. Nothing compares to those Mordrem, just bursting down anything running zerk/glass with 0 effort. Then they patched it, adjusted the difficulty, and it hasn't felt the same since
---
&gt; In that scenario how is it any different to current scourges 
---
10 targets around the shade or player is how its different.
---
Thanks very much! All of these brushes are the default brushes in ProCreate on the iPad.
---
Because they don't want to admit they made a mistake when they made f-gyro the f5 skill and removed detection pulse in the process.
---
Is there something about Arenanet's design philosophy that prevents them from making number changes? It seems like they are so reluctant in using small number tweaks to achieve balance instead of reworking mechanics in general.
---
I'm just finding it funny how chronos are lecturing us on what its like to be suddenly made useless. ^^
---
Steam library update? How?
---
sounds wicked cool
---
Prot holo makes a better bunker than scrapper. I know this because I play prot holo and whoop scrapper's asses.
---
I am saying that the day/night cycle itself does not tell you what event is starting and when. For that you either need to have to look it up online or be present in the map to figure that out.  
---
With other timers like chak gerent for example I know for any place and all times when it the event starts by just looking at it because it literally says that. The events in the map don't appear like that after all you are saying the day/night timer is enough... But that literally only shows whether it is day or night.
---
I remember when I first got HoT several years ago after going on hiatus for a while, and blindly went in with a level 80 in rare zerker gear.
---
As a rusty Ele player. Things did not go well.
---
That just made me stop playing the game because it's annoying to plow through.
---
Are you kidding? Reddit went crazy at HoT release because it was too hard.
---
isn't that exactly what the bounty system is designed for? Fights that are more difficult and impactful.
---
It drops from there, so you HAVE to do it.
---
Definitely mounts. Think of all the times you zoom by on your raptor or whatever. Now think of how many times that would get you killed without a mount.
---
Plus griffons and skyscales keep you out of range of most mobs anyways.
---
This post only serves to highlight how little you know about scourge.
---
Yes, I do understand that. XD
---
Again, just trying to find out if it’s the once-daily chests that give it, or the repeatable ones. That makes a big difference between just doing it every day or farming for hours. I only received bouncy chests once a day so far, which makes me wonder which chests the drops are limited to. 
---
I’m legit just here to talk with the community and see if anyone has info, man. I’ll be out there enjoying the map and content either way :D
---
I turned that off over a year ago and never looked back.
---
Yeah no, what you're see is simply a result of the TP cap being 10k. Because no one can post an order for above 10k, everyone posts at 10k and hopes they get lucky.
---
Hey pal! F*ck you! Come over to texas and we'll fry up your disdain! It kinda tastes like a parfait thats hot and cold at the same time.
---
That's a great line with the two charr females talking. Now they have a right to take up arms... they're scared they're not able to
---
For me they mainly feel annoying. Instead of designing a good fight there are these random modifiers of which half of them just lengthen the fight while offering no counterplay.
---
I *looooove* HoT's mobs on an individual level, they're fun to fight every now and then. I just get so very fucking tired fighting them over and over.
---
As a novel, occasional thing defending valuable resources or important objectives, they'd have been a hoot.
---
&gt; It's ok to point out flaws in an existing game and hope that they get fixed.
---
Sure but you still havent actually made a proper case that your suggested changes to the economy benefit the majority of the player base or suggested how to fix these perceived flaws in a realistic manner without micro management from Anet.
---
GW2 would also be an awesome game, if everybody gets a unique skin that only they will own every 28th login reward. Nobody from the player base wold disagree with that. But from Anets point of view, this isnt sustainable reward design becuae their production costs would be way too high for that.
---
You always come with the excuse that the system is flawed and its Anets responsibility to fix it and not yours. Obviously, they havent done anything to fix your perceived flaws of the game because they disagree with your opinion.
---
South would be so so much easier for me if I could actually select the damn bomb with tab.
---
I'm going to straight up say that you're a more skilled player than I am. I've researched and switched builds, I've changed my gear. HoT is still hard. You telling me that it's easy does not change that it's hard for me. It's like an advanced artist telling a beginner how simple and easy it is to draw an eye, and yet the beginner, despite being given all relevant tutorials and materials, still can't execute it. I'm just not at the same point as you.
---
At least you can rest assured that I'm not asking for nerfs. I just mostly keep to myself.
---
only half, the other half is some other voice actor... really immersion breaking.
---
Came back to fractals after like a year, discretize got hybrid chrono listed in "good" and dps chrono in "great" and nothing in meta. Huh? Purity of purpose makes chrono a second rate dps spec?
---
That doesn't mean I should stop pointing out that they still have work to do.
---
Mellitus event in the new map where you need to bring him specific ingredients he is asking for either "whole", "chopped" or "grilled".
---
Did anyone post a screenshot of it yet?
---
Rrecently got a hairstyling contract from a random map comp key I still had lying around. I‘ve definitely used up mine.
---
I can't think of many places in the open world - save for solo challenges - where I need to use many of my utilities.
---
Why not play to open world's strengths instead of its weaknesses? Trying to turn it into a stretched-out dungeon killed it, IMO. Open world content should emphasize exploration and discovery, with challenges being something you track down and get some satisfaction in completing, rather than a constant pestilence chewing on your ankles.
---
Where does it say that the winners would be publicly announced? I see no mention of this.
---
[This is on MTM's site for the event.](https://i.gyazo.com/0964322792b785e1bee6d510888f830c.png)
---
[And the GW2 article for it doesn't event mention when winners would be contacted.](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/win-a-guild-wars-2-mtm-special-ops-hypertec-watch/)
---
To be fair and play devil's advocate a little bit, there were 2 previous iterations of this post where they did ask for feedback, and received quite a lot, and changed things based on that feedback.
---
While Scrapper is certainly in an awkward (read: not great) spot right now, this is better communication and iteration than they've had in the past.
---
&gt; Is this guild full of high school kids, or is it just a bunch of man-children that frolic around a girl cause they are lonely, and a bunch of men with no experience with girls in the real world?
---
There's a difference?
---
Hell no, Guild Wars 2 was marketed as MMO for casuals back in 2012. HoT ruined the game for many people. No hardcore content in my game. Besides random mobs still hit harder than story bosses so it can be hard at time and since we have mounts now it's simply easier to move around. They have that "debuff" in the recent story that because it's so cold, mounts can't be used. So I guess they could use that mechanic in the icy maps and force us to travel on foot which would be cool imo.
---
Invite me to the guild. I wanna sow chaos.

Meh, I like that the meta events require teamplay and grouping up. I like how complex the maps work, so you actually have to explore and find your way. 
---
But sometimes it feels that they added too many mobs in a small area which makes some parts of the map a torture to explore. I don't mind a harder difficulty, but it should be difficult for a reason, not because spots are overcrowded with mobs that all have stuns.
---
I get what you're saying, I just feel like having to use a mount to avoid the enemies entirely is a bit of a band-aid. I don't mind having enemies *period* just them being so prevalent I literally cannot stand still even for a moment.
---
I'm saying that calling HoT "challenging content for veteran players" is inaccurate. Sure, it's challenging for people who are still learning how to play their class properly, but it's much closer to LW maps than it is to raids both structurally and difficulty wise. And we'll be getting more LW maps. Raids are entirely another issue.
---
&gt; But even now, Dragon Stand isn't necessarily a guarantee 
---
I've only done it enough times to get a couple of machined weapons and the leadership runes when that was the boon chrono meta, but I never once saw it fail.
---
&gt;  easier one like Octovine too
---
I've seen that fail a lot
---
sure, if pointing out what other people should do tickles your berry bush. but if you expect them to actually do it, you are dillusional.
---
its like pointing out to someone who just bought their dream home to build a new home by themselves that includes a waterslide just because you like waterslides without telling them how to build a waterslide or how it should look like.
---
The timer Starts when you Start the Boss , so dont worry with the jp Part :)
---
I think you don't understand the concept of being a try hard.
---
We don't miss difficult content in open world
---
This kicks ass!! Would you do the rest? :D
---
Idk. I'm in downstate like all the time. I think this game just isn't for me.
---
If you are having performance problems, the first thing to check for is memory utilization. In this age of browsers frequently able to eat up over a gigabyte of memory all on their own combined with the use of all manner of web overlays, you need more system memory than ever before.
---
**Windows Memory Compression:**
---
The first hint that you are running out of memory usually starts here. Windows 10 starts compressing memory when it would otherwise have to use disk based virtual memory. It's a lot faster than virtual memory, but slower than uncompressed RAM. You can see if memory is being compressed in the Task Manager.
---
Definitely consider upgrading to 16gig if you are at 8gig still. If you're still at 4 your potato needs help. Also, keep your graphics driver up to date.
---
Otherwise, a simple solution is to close the web browsers and remove all the overlays. Keep guildwars2 as the only thing running (pay attention to stuff in the taskbar too, sometimes apps don't really close, they go live as an icon there).
---
Some other things to help with performance.
---
**Heat:**
---
Keep your computer cool. Heat will cause your computer to slow down deliberately as it avoids overheating that can damage its components. This is especially true for laptops. 
---
**Virus Scanners:**
---
I restrict myself to use only the one in Windows 10. Everything else is overly bloated or untrustworthy.
---
&gt; It. Will. Not. Won't. This is the intended difficulty of strike missions.
---
Every time Anet adds something to the game that doesn't live up to expectations, people tell themselves that it'll get better over time because of whatever reason and it never does. Sometimes, the most obvious answer is the one staring you in the face. If people haven't figured this out by now, they never will.
---
I think I can see what you're saying - you feel their overall design direction is skewed towards trivial content, rather than being balanced even slightly to the other side. I can kind of agree with that, as the types of content that I usually found myself getting stuck into (PvP, Fractals, even dungeons [RIP]) haven't seen an update in yonks.
---
I'm of the opinion that the majority of the open world should remain fairly breezy, though. I love having a challenging meta come up every now and then, and I *loved* Dragon Stand my first few times through, but even the most challenging mobs littering the world just become annoying after a time, due to the fact you have to fight them repeatedly on your way through an area.
---
I suppose I just wish they could strike something of a balance. The game doesn't need to be easy *all of the time*, just as it doesn't need to be hard *all of the time*. While I like the direction the new update suggests, I'm a little worried Arenanet won't provide anything to really sink my teeth into when I do eventually get bored of exploring.
---
It's difficult to be in the jungle and I love it. Tangled Depths excellent.
---
I could maybe see if the chair wasn't able to be TP'd but the visage helms that are not tradeable and are a part of ap drive me insane. Have done map comp on 16 chars and the dailys and haven't even seen one decent drop from the recoverred charr artifacts.
---
Thanks! I *might* at some point but tbh the 3 songs are kinda similar to each other so I don't feel like doing that at least for now.
---
You're meant to avoid the AoE by jumping forward while standing on the platform.   
---
As for the tell: It stops and turns to the platform it's going to smash, that's your cue to get on top of a platform that isn't gonna be Detroit Smash'd
---
I’ll have to check where it said it, it specifically said somewhere it would be announced via Facebook on Sept 15. You can downvote if you want while I look.
---
Same but had problems on ESO, not GW2, I fixed it by changing the sound format to 16Bits 44100Hz, give it a try! Microsoft knows about the problems and said they'd fix them on a release by the end of September.
---
Oh, I almost forgot, the best part about the changes was that up until they removed boonshare entirely, each nerf made both power Chrono and boon chrono more powerful.  Iirc the mimic rotation allowed Chrono 100% uptime on an additional boon that the lesser SoI rotation didn't have (can't remember what it was, I think it was either stability or aegis), and I think power Chrono was able to dps at +42k dps.
---
Haha, thanks! Metal often does that lol
---
I made a video about his appearance in new patch and what happen with him there, link below if someone is interested.

---
Then i find all the hidden shortcuts or forgotten routes and realize “oh yeah, TD truly is the best map ever”
---
You guys should really play the events and listen to what NPCs saying during Living Story. A lot of people got upset with Braham during this story because of all the drinking but you have to ask yourself: Why is he drinking? One of his conversations referenced Rox and it shows that hes drinking because she left him.
---
I'm aware - I did gvg &amp; tombs for yrs.   Admittedly, most of their pvp balancing mistakes ended up being pretty fun, but you definitely got the idea that they were kind of just throwing things at the wall on many of the changes.
---
Also Olmakhan are not part of the High Legions, and the events in Bound by Blood are pretty much a political gathering.
---
Nah, they know they're mini-raids. They just call them "Strikes" because there are genuinely people who get emotionally triggered by the word, "raid".
---
Probably using a non steam game shortcut
---
Maybe those all WERE Braham. During his drunken excursion he skinned the charr, took their pelts and armor, and is now running around impersonating them.
---
Knew a charr who couldn’t get enough 'em. Ah, memories.
---
These people can't be appeased.
---
Also I don't know why you think the marketing is bad... they had a huge audience on the stream, they have several teasers leading up to it and the episode is blowing people away.
---
This is no confirmation of that. It's most likely cut content.
---
I would like to see a alternative way to obtain the Super Rare Infusions/Chairs and have them be account bound. By making them account bound you can increase their drop rate(like 1-2%) and have then retain their value from sellable versions.
---
Isn't it just that the bushes are adjacent to devourer nests and those devourers have a chance of dropping them? It can look like the bush spawns them, but it's from the nest from what I've seen in my 100+ nest destroying
---
Kind of like winterberry mob packs, but much easier to avoid and stay OOC
---
As someone whose completed most of pof but not hot, the terrain was my biggest challenge.  The topography can be a real head ache at times.
---
No, it means you're unhealthy attached to this game (or trolling the subreddit because you feel like you're obligated to), and seriously should take a break from circlejerking, if not to stop bringing toxicity to the discussion, then at least for your own good - it's incredibly unhealthy to get this worked up to become keyboard warrior "on a crusade to stop the shills and whiteknighting". IDK how huge is your ego or how fragile it is - but you're not the only person in the world and voicing different opinion than yours doesn't mean that  it is less valid.
---
Yes. To this day I still think HoT maps are more fun. Perhaps they are a bit too map-wide event focused, but at the end of the day they are more engaging maps. I feel like since HoT, world bosses/major events that have been added to the game are too easy and just not very interesting. Kind of killed open world for me.
---
Wow, that was very educative. Thanks!
---
Oh thanks! I'll include the link in the masterpost :)
---
um. no. having a gas field is not free. its taking a skill slot that could be used for something else. every game mode has a rotation. currently the scrapper's bread and butter is 5 skill to stun target then 3 to close in on your target. that is (by its definition) a rotation regardless of the combo size.
---
Incorrect. Still not proven. Still fooling yourself. Still disingenuous. One who has nothing to gain wouldn't be continuing this thread.
---
She’ll come back eventually, she’s just been set aside to give other characters some time in the spotlight. Also gone are Rox (though I doubt anyone really misses her, other than Braham, anyways) and Canach (who is really more like Tyrion than Taimi is).
---
Hearts were turned into events ever since heart of thorns and before.
---
While scrappers have certainly been nerfed a lot in the past (lots of classes have) the difference is that when you get chrono’d, you have to watch as anet removes a bunch of the cool, creative gameplay things that only the top percentile of players were doing, and then replace them with dumb downed, face roll, hollowed out versions of their former selves.  
---
So like, when your sustain and damage got nerfed way back in the day, that’s a nerf.,.  But now that your advanced combos are getting deleted from the game in favor of LULXPUSHABUTTON IN TEH ZERGGGGGG skills, well now yer in chrono country.  
---
And for the record, I’m not a chrono main.
---
dT hasn’t updated in a pretty long time...
---
I mean chronos still fine (if you don’t mind waiting in LFG longer or have a static), but I don’t see how dps chrono can be “great” when weebers and DH’s can phase the bosses before you even get through your continuum split.
