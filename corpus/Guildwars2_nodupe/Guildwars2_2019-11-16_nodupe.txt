So what was the clear answer to why they are rotating them? Didn't have time to watch the stream.
---
---
---
Listen to your friend, they seem to be pretty savvy in what they're talking about. That being said, I'd skip the PoF prep pack, personally. I couldn't recommend that to anyone as a must have. 
---

---
As for your second list, the teleport things (perma WP to friend / home teleport / the boss teleporters) are all pretty useless IMO. Once you've spent a little bit of time exploring the major places your fancy gemstore item just kind of sits there uselessly. Get yourself one of the convenience VIP passes when they come on sale instead (Eg. Mistlock Sanctuary, Armastice Bastion, Royal Terrace are all pretty popular) so you can have quick, free travel to home cities. 
---
I wouldn't bother with home node upgrades. Hang around cities at reset and you'll get plenty of people offering access to their full nodes. 
---
Copper fed salvage kit is definitely 100% the most useful thing on that list. :)
---
Where exactly is this?
---
Good point about doing plenty of farming/dungeons/fractals one after another.   
---
Guess it makes the experience flow better without the occasional restock
---
well my favorite hidden places and secret places were the ones I found myself, like early jumping puzzles in caladon and the hidden spots in heart of thorns and path of fire. I think it was the act of discovery that made me like them, specifically. If I were dragged to them, I don't think they would have that specialness.
---
&gt;Get yourself one of the convenience VIP passes when they come on sale instead
---
Think i already get the Lily one from buying the game ?
---
Would you consider the copper fed better, or just as good as having 3 permanent tools?
---
Got it! I think i'll be running litany on my own exploring while getting used to the build. Don't plan on going into a group (minus world boss) until i'm comfortable with this class.
---
I'll stick with berserker with 3 diviners while i farm the other trinkets off lws3. 
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
Now you can finally quit, sweet release.
---
its been asked for since launch, but they've only been working on it for a few years. and even that was mostly handled by like 1 guy as a passion project, which they fully picked up several months ago
---
Raids, fractals, metas, map completions, pvp...
---
Tengu
---
Okay understood. I'll play it abit more while doing exploration and see if I can get the feel of it. 
---
Can I dm you for future questions too? :)
---
I take it as a “we aren’t going to answer so you will have to see”.  No reason to get hyped or let down until it’s out IMO.
---
How do you get back up on the platform to go to the other eye tho?
---
Digging through the buried convo and adding to it is apparently more interesting that adding to OP's question? Perhaps you agree with me then?
---
With what?
---
Not really hidden, more just unknown, but the high mushroom room in Jahai bluffs.
---
Also, the grotto in the Grove.
---
The cat camp in Sirens Landing
---
&gt; The goal is to make a single encounter valuable for all tiers of combatants.
---
Are strike missions not valuable for everyone?  They are not necessarily challenging, but that is not the same thing as valuable.
---
&gt; The same festivals and events we've been doing for the past 5 years?
---
Yup. But I haven't played their Wintersday stuff in a year, so I'm ready to play it again for a bit. Is it the most exciting content ever? No. But it's better than nothing at all, and like I said, it's unrealistic to expect them to produce an episode's worth of content every month or two, so the festivals are good for filling the time in between releases. 
---
&gt;Warframe, path of exile (both of which are free to play by the way when gw2 is not) seem to be managing pretty well.
---
&gt;As does wow, final fantasy, TESO, destiny 2, fuck even risk of rain 2, payday 2, vermintide 2, killing floor 2, most games with 2 at the end of their name except tf2 basically.
---
None of those produce more content per unit of time than GW2 does. You just seem to prefer the content they produce over the content that GW2 produces, and that's fine, but still just your opinion. 
---
&gt;Fractals, PvP, WvW, Elite specs, and Raids are part of what gw2 is.
---
They used to be, but like you said, they stopped updating those, and really they should have stopped way earlier, because the community largely stopped caring about them almost immediately. 
---
&gt;You see, the kinetic energy generated by you vigoriously riding Anet's dick does not actually produce enough electricity to keep the lights on. The need people to actually play the game and buy shit.
---
I don't think you understand how bussiness works. 
---
You see, the kinetic energy generated by you vigoriously slamming on the keyboard that they aren't doing what *you* want them to does not actually produce enough electricity to keep the lights on. The need people to actually play the game and buy shit.
---
People do. Hundreds of thousands of people who are *not* you play and enjoy this game for what it is, rather than whining about what it isn't. Despite all your whining, this is still one of the top ten MMOs on the market, often one of the top 5s, and has had relatively stable revenue for years in an industry that typically sees much more significant declines.
---
You don't enjoy this game, that's fine. 
---
Others do. 
---
Those others are plenty to keep the game running.
---
no worries, glad i could help
---
as a side note, condition firebrand is far stronger in open world because of f1 tome resets..and honestly it's not that bad in fractals either due to its bursty nature
---
\[PL\]: A potem spotykasz mnie na solo kolejce i robię Ci z dupy Jesień Średniowiecza, idź spać Retardaxar ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
\[ENG\]: Very nice video
---
Nah I play alac rev and dps qb. So I know that these specs have all the utility we need. Including reflects, stab and pulls.
---
Also got 750+ kp so I did my fair share of cms to tell which classes put out the highest numbers. I never said reaper is common but I said it performs top stats when done correctly. Never had any dps pull higher numbers than him/her on most bosses if not all.
---
&gt; That hasn't been my experience, but you do you.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Just don't project that onto others.
---
How many hours did the campaign take you to finish?
---
&gt;None of that stuff, 
---
&gt;new abilities to play with,
---
You might want to start keeping your story straight, because 2 comments above you said that lack of elite specs isn't bad if you don't care about them.
---
So, suddently you do care about them?
---
&gt;The things I care about are new maps,  new events to play, the new story content, 
---
And after you spend the 2 hours that it takes to complete them, then what?
---
&gt;I care about Guild Wars 2.
---
You care about guild wars, except about 90% of it.
---
&gt;Again, that's your playstyle, but that is not how Guild Wars 2 players play. Grothmar Valley was well populated at least up to the Halloween event. Most players play these new areas well beyond "two hours," but if you only want to play for "two hours" then that's your choice.
---
Please, do say. How long did the campaign take you to finish?
---
&gt;I got more enjoyment out of LWs4 than I did out of most of HoT's base experience. 
---
&gt;The maps were bigger and more interesting,
---
And they were abandoned as soon as the new update came out.
---
&gt;the story was better.
---
The story was objectively shittier and you can make an extremely good case for it due to its over-reliance on deus ex machinas, predictable endings, and undermining of its own messages, especially with the themes around death and the arc in the final tree episodes of consequences and attrition of war being undermined by the finale. 
---
Sure you can subjectively like the story, but if we actually examine it objectively and see how it holds up under scrutiny thematically and structually it doesn't.
---
&gt;The only advantage HoT had was in the elite specs, but now I already have some good specs, and haven't even switched many of my characters from HoT to PoF specs, so I'm not desperate for new ones.
---
Elite specs are one of the few things that actually properly shake up the game, they are the only feature that is usable on every single gamemode and drastically changes how you play. Lack of them is a big deal for this reason alone. You not caring doesn't change that.
---
&gt;We don't know what else s5 will bring, what "expansion-like features" it might contain that they have yet to announce. It's possible you're right and at the end of it we'll agree that it could have been a lot better, but I'm optimistic that they will be able to provide an exansion-worthy experience.
---
Anet is not going to unveil a brand new earthshaking feature/update out of the blue that leaves everyone in awe, they've never done it before, and they are not going to start now. The closest they ever came to something like that was mounts, and if you think that we're going a feature on the scale of mounts with lws5 you're insane. 
---
They had the opportunity to unveil said feature in the funko-pop presentation and they did not, and later on in interviews they confirmed that their idea of expansion worthy features are shit like 500 cooking.
---
They are not digital extremes, and gw2 is not warframe. There is no surprising mindblow update coming.
---
&gt;Again, that's your experience, not mine. "2 hours every 4 months" is how long you apparently spend on each new patch, not how much time most GW2 players spend.
---
You can spend 30 hours studying the pixels on a quagan's asshole, that doesn't make it content. Anet adds content that you can start and finish. And it takes roughly 4 hours to finish coming out every 4 months.
---
&gt;Were you actually unaware that you can play on those maps without being in the story missions themselves? There's a lot you're missing out on.
---
Yes, you can also complete the shitty repetitive events that are impossible to fail unless you actually try to on purpose once, which takes roughly 2 more hours.
---
First new strike is out in few days. They have the answer, they just don't want to tell us. (aka NO)
---
I mean EVERYONE, from noobs to elites, whether they're looking for a fun moment or a tormenting crucible. Scale it ALL the way down and up, with increased rewards for withstanding increased difficulty. A single encounter that can individually stand in for multiple game modes, from easy story to raid-tier.
---
Okay but they’re the **best thieves**. I think this is a common problem in the pvp community. See, everybody is copying the builds that the pros are using and they’re trying to copy the play style, but they’re not as skilled so they’re sucking really bad at pvp.
---
You have to build to your play style, most people **need** the stealth because they’re not super skilled and when the gap closes they’re fucked. 
---
If you’re going to play a class, make sure you’re playing it to your skill level. Don’t copy something just because you saw somebody do it really well in a video.
---
My problem was that you used the word "valuable" when by context your meant challenging or enjoyable.  Currently, this strike mission is the only way to get Shoulders of the Ebon Vanguard, which sell for 80 gold.  Therefore, in it's current state, it is valuable. 
---
ANET sold this event a something that newer players could use as a stepping stone for getting into raid content, not a substitute for raid content.  Your suggestions would be great at making it more challenging, but that does not seem like the intended purpose for the event.
---
The only bad part about lily is the mystic forge placement.
---
Made me go ‘phew’
---
I got the impression that part of it was they're trying something different to keep the content from getting too stale too quickly.
---
Like all other wings - to the trash. Charr wing wings look like monkey from ozz https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d0/30/c1/d030c1543fef9778ef8b9a0bb532f419.jpg
---
&gt; Well they are making opposite right now!
---
No need to make new fractals, if people don't want to play them 5head
---
agreed. with less than a week before it launches I wouldn't expect them to do anything now but maybe afterwards. the trailer really made everything look awesome and polished, except for essence manipulation lmao. if we can at least move while casting that would help immensely with the stiff feeling the trailer gave me.
---
Over 1 year ago: FA staff weaver: 43k dps, over 2 years ago: condi weaver 42k dps, over 2 years ago: arcane tempest 43k dps, over 3 years ago: FA tempest 45k dps, also some renegade 38k dps on release, even condi thief once pulled 40k. For the longest time before that FGS 4 was untouched featuring even higher dps but yeah yeah its a bug etc etc but it was in the game for so long its impossible to ignore
---
Boring imo, but that's because I played it SEVERAL times to get luminescent armor. 
---
Why they ever thought unskippable dialog was a good idea I will never understand. Especially since LS2 is a LOT of dialog.
---
Is it worse than Pokemon Swo/Shi~~t~~?
---
They shouldn't design around effectiveness in dungeons and raids.
---
I love that content but its really not where most of the players play. The game should be focused on making new interesting concepts. Not just things that already work. 
---
And range isn't bad in raids. It's just that the fact that you can attack at range isn't used because stacking together is so op.
---
i assumed he was talking about build templates, which might just be the absolute worst update to the game Anet has ever introduced. it is the most outwardly greedy piece of broken untested, unrefined code they have ever inserted into the game and i am completely disgusted by it and their lack of action since its implementation. absolute loss of functionality in game for some inventory space. inventory space is literally the only thing i actually GOT from the update rather than lost. this is like when they gem stored cultural armor and suddenly any race could wear a flaming version of the human cultural armor, absolutely disgusting and greedy as well and one of the worst decisions they have ever made in this game in terms of how "fuck you" it is to the playerbase. if that one was number 1, it is now number 2 under build templates
---
Why would the kneeling restriction even matter? In the vast majority of pve encounters standing still is what you are doing anyway. And in PvP it actually matter it provides counter play.
---
Removing the kneeling component won't fix the issue and will just make for a worse design overall.
---
Is there a recommend path or video to go from fresh 80 to raid ready?  Also, is there an alternative to using Chronomancers in raids?
---
&gt; the stiff feeling the trailer gave me
---
all seems well
---
LOL
---
It's specifically for Open World, so the builds are all self-sufficient, which would be the opposite of fractals and raids, where the ideal builds rely on supports to provide all the buffs so the DPS can focus on the DPS.
---
That said, if you are comfortable with a build that does well in open world, you will likely be fine for T1 (ie 1-25) fractals. Example: while it's not on WP's recommended list, I have taken my open world Axe/x Mirage into T1s and done just fine. People don't generally focus on the team building in T1, so it's not too much different from open world, in the self-sufficiency aspect. Just don't expect it to work on higher tiers.
---
And as a general rule, if you are doing a DPS build on an elite spec that is commonly used for support (Chronomancer, Firebrand and Renegade come to mind, all of which are the choices for WP's open world series), especially if venturing past T1, it may be helpful to let the group know you are using a DPS build, to avoid confusion.
---

---
I think you can not use way point at least. That would solve some of your problem. I feel quite immersed when I play because of the amount of ambient dialogue and because I'm reacting to the world and not the UI.
---
One idea that I used to do back in the day is go to your big map and turn off all map markers by clicking the eye on the bottom left.  No markers on the map make the game far more immersive.
---
do you really think getting the raid legendary is too hard if you compare it to the 2000 wvw rank legendary?
---
And for that reason you will never have in game wealth
---
The quaggan nursery in the zone south of LA. Sparkfly I think? Its on the western edge of the map.
---
Yeah, but new gear is cool, has a differnt look, you actually "feel" the progression. This here is just a super lame "boost that number in that box"-thing.
---
I’ve never tried the map trick, i will certainly do
---
Then something is missing for sure. Take a pic of your setting menu. I'm running high on all and it looks like a dream
---
Happens to warrior warhorn skills too.
---
&gt; How many hours did the campaign take you to finish?
---
I didn't have a stop watch going, but likely closer to 3-4, doing events and exploration in between. Obviously that wasn't the end of my exploration of the content though, I spent the next month or so running events in Grothmar (always very well attended, so I certainly wasn't the only one), completing the daily there, filling out some achievements, stocking up on peppers, etc. 
---
&gt;You might want to start keeping your story straight, because 2 comments above you said that lack of elite specs isn't bad if you don't care about them.
---
New toys can be fun, but they aren't necessarily *necessary.* I mean if they want to throw in more elite specs, I certainly wouldn't be like "no! get away with those!" If any look fun, I'll play with them. I just don't see them as vital to whether the game is worth playing or not. I mean, any new thief spec they add would force me to de-equip my Bifrost, and it would have to be *pretty* cool to do that.
---
&gt;And after you spend the 2 hours that it takes to complete them, then what?
---
Again, stop projecting. It takes *you* 2 hours to be done with this stuff. That clearly doesn't apply to people who are not you. This goes back to my point, clearly this game isn't offering you the things *you* need to be happy, so it would be better for everyone if you found one that did. 
---
&gt;You care about guild wars, except about 90% of it.
---
I play all the parts that *matter,* just not PvP, WvW, raids, dungeons, or fractals. 
---
&gt;And they were abandoned as soon as the new update came out.
---
That's the nature of any maps, whether they are released in LW updates or expansions. People play through them until they've cleared out the fresh content, and then either advance to the next thing, or fall back to the most efficient farmable content available. I don't see this as a bad thing, the new maps add variety over the time that they are fresh, it's impossible for every map to retain permanent "meta" status, people can only play on one map at a time.
---
&gt;The story was objectively shittier and you can make an extremely good case for it due to its over-reliance on deus ex machinas, predictable endings, and undermining of its own messages, especially with the themes around death and the arc in the final tree episodes of consequences and attrition of war being undermined by the finale. 
---
I don't want to get into a semantic argument about how you don't know what "objective" means.
---
&gt;Elite specs are one of the few things that actually properly shake up the game, they are the only feature that is usable on every single gamemode and drastically changes how you play. 
---
Again though, the other game modes are no longer relevant.
---
&gt;Anet is not going to unveil a brand new earthshaking feature/update out of the blue that leaves everyone in awe, they've never done it before, and they are not going to start now. 
---
I don't know about that. I mean, s4 dropped in two unannounced mounts, at least. It added the Sun's Refuge base-building concept. And s4 was always just intended as a follow-up to the PoF expansion. With s5, they have deliberately staked out that they want this to be "something new," something more than *just* the Living World seasons we're used to. 
---
Will it turn out to *just* be another LW season? Possibly, and while I'd be ok with that, I would be disappointed. But I am still optimistic that there will be more to it than that, that there will be "expansion level" content by the end of it, I just think that it's in keeping with ANet's communications policies (agree with them or not), that they would never announce these big features more than a few months before they actually drop into the game. 
---
Remember their "big announcement" over the summer, and how lame that was? Did they mention these new Raven masteries? No. They didn't announce anything substantive, because they don't do that until it's more or less ready to ship. I'm not a fan of that policy, but it does mean that you can never assume to know what the next year or more of content is going to involve. 
---
I'll just throw this out there, I think that by the end of s5, there will be a full series of new Elite specs in the game. Whether they dribble these out class-by-class, or have players quest to unlock them over several updates, or dump them all into the mid-season update, I bet we'll be getting them. Again, I don't see this as absolutely necessary, but I think it would be cool, if done right. One of the kind of lame things about the expansion specs is how they just "appear" in the world without much build-up. It would be better if the story naturally *leads* to and *works towards* these new options. 
---
&gt;You can spend 30 hours studying the pixels on a quagan's asshole, that doesn't make it content. Anet adds content that you can start and finish. And it takes roughly 4 hours to finish coming out every 4 months.
---
Ok, but again, **that is not how most people play it.** Most people who play this game **enjoy** this game, and play it for more than the bare minimum amount of time to clear a story chapter.
---
Any new raid or fractal CM ? 
---
Just kidding D:
---
&gt; No it's not ok but what can we do really?
---
Well, make clear that we're not okay with this. Which means not financially supporting what's currently happening.
---
Dead game.
---
Because they might not enjoy raiding.
---
Arenanet have always been really big into the artistry of the world itself, even since GW1.  Most of these aren't really "hidden" as such since, Anet tends to put things that point you to the hidden stuff.  Far more than GW1 did at any rate.  
---
There are so many more of these too, but generally if there is a Vista, PoI, Guild Trek Target or similar in the area then there's something the devs want to show off there.  
---
Also most of these are from character screenshots or a suggestion I made to them a long while back of assets already in the world that could make interesting guild decorations.

Literally too many to recount lol

Just do a couple of Verdant brink metas the armor there is exotic and allow's you to choose any status, you can buy everything besides the armor from the npc if im not mistaken, the armor you got finishing the night meta
---
It's a bit tedious to make yourself do it all the time, but occasionally I make myself get where I need to go without waypoints, and I always enjoy the trip.
---
What really hurts the immersion, though, is the lack of overland routes to most LW maps, and the lack of a physical connection between Elona and the rest of Tyria. At the very least I would love there to be more lore-friendly "ferrymen" and airship rides to make the loading screen more justifiable.
---
If you want some background on HoT story you should get it. Besides that, it's not that much worth it. The reason is because, without having played season 1 and never being able to, you won't know what's going on at all and if you're not already invested in the characters, then it'll be super dull.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I advise you to look up a season 1 story compilation on youtube in order to learn about the missing chapters of the story (season 1) before you ever even think of getting season 2.
---
Triple dh is far from meta aswell and it will drop hard as soon as they bugfix this broken shit. Its the only class that can cast traps and swap them out after and PI signets shouldnt stack at all. Is a dps dh really bringing stab or reflects? The only boss where you can convince your average pug dh to do this is probably sirens reef or art to dps greed.
---
Reaper has btw a pull aswell and it can boonstrip so ren dps doesnt tank with npng. Reaper golem dps doesnt matter at all since it can camp shroud the whole dps phase. 250kp isnt even high btw. Thats pretty normal to have even for weekend players now.
---
I legit found that today at like 1900 hours!
---
It's fine imo, plenty of other stuff to do.

agreed, that what many players were feeling around that time.  This was during living story season 1, there were a lot of issues going on back then.

That was in fact the point of the post, as a fan of Core Steal. I'd really like it if we could have more choices than this. Trickery is the unambiguous third line, and an obligatory PvP line, for all the worst reasons.
---
GOOD RESPONSE. All the more reason for ANet to make Gear Templates and Legendary gear work hand-in-hand. Still tired of all the folks crying about the buffs other people got.
---
Literally a single type of CC is spammy CC now? It could be an attack with a 4 day wind up and a duration of 1 second on a 4 day cooldown for all we know.
---
Its okay for enemies to have skills and abilites that inconvenience the player, the only the problem is if they are overtuned and there is no counterplay or way to avoid it.

---
i think the general consensus, even for someone like me who literally does not have a reason to utilize build templates let alone waste, and i really mean waste, my money on those overpriced "upgrades", everything about this system except for the 4 freed up inventory spaces has been a literal downgrade. I'm not even one of the people who uses more than one build and it still feels like a downgrade. So much broken, so much basic functionality lost that we already had. this might singlehandidly be the worst piece of code anet has ever inserted into the live game in all 7 years, and i really mean that. the build template update was a pure failure and will require probably as much work to fix as it took to fix HoT, so i'll give them a year (it probably wont be enough time)
---
There is currently no way to get Envoy armor through open world PvE. You currently *have to* run raids, which most players have no interest in doing. Subjective arguments over "difficulty" are irrelevant.

There was a short vid on here of a guy in WvW just tanking an entire zerg without losing much health.
---
Could you imagine if they gave raiders completing (and yes, people buying) the hardest raids something actually cool, and sort of on the level of intricacy as the latest GS lege? Instead you got a continuation of the OW, press-F, legendaries, which, oh-by-the-way, causes a turd to hover over your head.
---
Now try this with 280 ping.
---
Seriously though, it's cool but unnecessary. A backup ensures a smooth run.
---
was it a special halloween skin?
---
Go for the eyes Boo!
---
One time the voice lines of  "Shout" skills could be heard across the whole map. It was quite trippy hearing random voice lines like "Shake it off" or "Stand your ground" with no player around you. Also the same patch caused the party UI to break, specifically the HP bar colours. I dont remember exactly but i think it turned the Downed Red HP bar to green or something.
---
Instead you go back to a game thats rehashing the same game to play in 2019. Tell me more about this integrity you speak of. Lulz.
---
EDIT: Also the most severe bug was that they managed to soulbind every item in banks etc. It was so severe and unfixable that they rolled back the servers.
---
But why?
---
How did you even get those.. you can't even shift click them in game  O_O
---
That one time when WvW became a PvE map as all servers became allies. The only competition then was seeing which server can burn down the grub at EBG...
---
rare drops being valuable doesn't mean much when the drop chance is virtually inexistent. farming gold via the current rando flavour of the season gold farm and then buying those rare drops off of someone on the TP who has better RNG also doesn't feel great.
---
assuming they keep the exact same loot system from the first strike with similar drop chances there is two ways they can provide value:
---
- entertaining gameplay for as many people as possible
---
- tricking players into thinking that dropping a single thing is more valuable than just spending that time farming the equivalent in gold from a reliable farm
---
the latter alone can't carry a mode or meta. stuff like e.g. gerent, AB, and casino are popular because they provide decent base rewards per time spent actively playing with the *bonus* allure of a potential "jackpot*-like drop. however it's the base reward that makes people come back and keeps them interested as that stuff is realistically obtainable by "just playing" unlike some BS carrot on a stick.

Played too much? Thats in Kessex Hills near the beetle race 🤣
---
Thank you for taking your time and giving me lots of details and feedback on the items! :)
---
First of all, when i say "asap" i what i meant was that those items caught my eye and seem like a great value for my money. An example would be getting 2 bank and bag expansions (2000g) but if i buy the Account jump start i will get 10 lootbox keys and 30 random dyes as well.
---
Buying a character slot and permanent gathering tools already costs 3200g, but the PoF preparation pack give so much more for just 300g more.
---
I'm still a F2P atm, and i am enjoying the game a lot, and i am considering buying it soon (like i said, maybe ill get some discount cause black friday?).  As for the lv80 boosters ,yes i was "warned" about them before. My plan is to use them on alts,or on my 8th-9th character on a class that's a bit hard /boring to lvl up. But most likely i'll be using it as a trial a lot.
---
As for +2 character slots (and trying to lvl up all 9 professions) yes i really want to have those, and play trough the story differently on different races. But i am not in a hurry of any kind so i will most likely enjoy the 6-7 slots for a long time and just buy the character expansions when they go on sale.
---
So i see i guessed correctly on the usefulness of those non cosmetic items after all. I'm really surprised on the cash shop and how little must haves there are. 
---
Compared to some other games that i played like eso where they sell event tickets, skill points, entire skill line unlocks, and skipping time gates on trait research and mount upgrades (which takes months to finish them all and is per character).
---
Or bdo..but that's a another whole can of worms there :)
---
My friend told me this is a "casual" game that has a little bit for everyone, but mainly focuses on pve exploration, achievements and story line which gets better and better in quality each season as arena net improved it drastically over the years. 
---
And because of that there are many different kinds of players out there that use (or don't) the gem shop differently.
---
Since release he bought all expansions (cause they weren't bundled like today?) a few character slots , and the silver fed salvage-o-matic (cause he said he was salvaging hundreds of rares for some reason ?)
---
I think we did the math correctly and for him the game costs around 30€ per year, for 7 years which is incredible
---
another one: the fairly recent wvw event that allowed you to pick up another profession's (poorly chosen) skills. apart from the event not activating properly, there alse was a teeeeeeny tiny bug that allowed you to reset CDs...
---
Don't know what point you're trying to make with this butthurt statement. I think we can easily agree that GW2 reminds you of its Gemstore everytime you open the build tab, bank, inventory etc. WoW classic doesn't have such thing and I like it.
---
I never thought about using the gobbler for its wvw and pvp reward tracks. Good to know :)
---
I really liked the BWE1 text with it's nice smooth font and italic leaning. The current font has always looked too rough around the edges.
---
Those were so much fun, especially the Branded battle royale thing at the end of BWE2!
---
Thank you for your insight :)
---
It's good to see that we're all still very mature here
---
I don’t think any other team games have any solution for this
---
Your best solution is like getting yourself in high elo to avoid it
---
this.
---
Someone gathered guardians for Tequatl and they did so much damage so fast that they skipped the invul phases and bugged the entire fight
---
It’s trash. Let the game mode die peacefully.
---
Hello Erik
---
Found them on the background of account sign up page.
---
I see: CI 8H and B48 B ?
---
Happened 4 times today at pre-stacking on diviner which is rather punishing...
---
I think waypoints can be immersive as gw2 isn't just a medieval fantasy game, it has quite a lot of technology influence as well. 
---
What I used to do when I was RPing was to only use waypoints that are in the main hubs of the map or those within fortified sanctuaries and forts, and basically pretend there is only a single waypoint in one map. To me this made waypoints more immersive as while fast travel through teleportation was possible, it wasn't too widespread and it was only to places where it makes sense for the Asura to set up a waypoint (troops congregate there or there are many travelers in the area). 
---
Additional stuff you can do to make waypoints more immersive is to use a techy skin on your char and pretend its like a tuning device that allows you to save the coordinates of waypoints you have discovered, and set those coordinates up when you want to travel to that waypoint. With that device, you can walk under a waypoint anywhere and pretend that you are actually setting up the coordinates and traveling between waypoints, rather than merely teleporting. I personally didn't use a device on my armor (as I didn't want to change my look), but I walked physically to a waypoint if I wanted to travel elsewhere. 
---
If you are really hardcore about it, you can walk to a waypoint while mounted so you can teleport to the map you want to go with your mount. Of course, since you can 'bring' only one of your mounts this way, you can either use only one mount in the map you are traveling to or you can go back and forth to 'bring' each of your mounts.
---
I'm not really the apologist you are looking for friend. I just saw someone in distress and hoped I could help them find a path out of the situation that brought them there. Take care, I am rooting for you.
---
valid point about finances, although i do think that it would be a fair better investment to do what players want that something so broken that causes the same behavior you chose to have, not to spend money, seems like a poor financial plan to ask people what they want and just ignore and do something else, like they did with feedback pre-launch of the system.
---
as for their no obligation to gives us feedback, that is also a fair point, but i would like to point out that if that is their stance then saying things like "we care" or like they said presentation "its the community that motivates us to build the game" should be called for the lies that they are
---
but by point is not one of morality but of clarity, i don't feel entitled to a say in their grand plan, i just ask that when they say they are listning they be honest about it, either way
---
voting with your wallet will never work, they will just put more qol and features behind paywall.
---
of course not! i care about the "quality of life" provided by..what? an extra random clone? or the amazing "utility" provided by having 2 random bone minions
---
the point is those builds accoplish nothing, neither dps nor any other benefit
---
but good reply man, great counterarguments
---
a point i cant disproof, but at the same time even a team of 1 should not charge for work that they didn't do right.
---
i wouldn't pay a painter for half the job we previously agreed upon, specially with no reason or justification.
---
&gt; Please offer your best argument for the lack of any conclusive response from arena net to the feedback offered by the players 
---
It's Saturday.
---
Everything related to dungeons
---
The battle royale at the end of the beta was fantastic.
---
But confusion stacked in duration, not intensity, no?
---
thats a bummer, i would hope at least that they considered the broken nature of the product instead of the time of purchase.
---
If we are going by industry standards (like GGG communication, which is apparently widely praised on this subreddit), then we need to wait month-two for any reaction to the feedback concerning feature of this level when we are in the two week period before next content patch release. Currently devs are working on LS release, then they will be working for a next 2-3 weeks on hotfixing and making changes on that episode - and only then we may see some changes being made to templ.. loadouts.
---
You censored the GM name at the bottom but not at the very top.
---
a point i cant argue, i suppose one could always be on a Saturday morning mood, and that's quite a good idea.
---
The 4th lane in Dragon's Stand. It shows how much of a genius Colin Johanson was with developing HoT, really.
---
How many days since the last WvW tournament? Right, 1996 days.
---
a point i cant disproof, but at the same time even a team of 1 should not charge for work that they didn't do right. i wouldn't pay a painter for half the job we previously agreed upon, specially with no reason or justification.
---
ok repeat that whole sentence but replace Story with Sieran
---
then do it again with Story and keep a straight face
---
People get committed to GW2's story, it's plagued by the same terrible misdirection each new twist and turn. I know few people who weren't VERY upset when Aurene died, and yet, literally five minutes into the next release, that story beat gets undone. Decisions like this, coupled with terrible villains (praise Joko), and utter annihilation being The Stakes for seven years makes the writing shit. Just because it's shit, and it's been shit, doesn't mean people don't give a shit, or that it can't be good.
---
Mallyx on Tev had displace ability on its aoe skills. It went through aegis and stab. 5 mallyxes on staircase meant that an entire zerg was zapping around randomly as they got displaced again and again.
---
Power Holosmith
---
it's kitless, so less of a massive leap up from Necro or Mirage, but definitely a lot of fun. Pretty average for viability in any mode.
---
ANet encourages this type of gameplay. Market is flooding with certain type of material? Have another potentially profitable random sink.
---
For me, the most annoying one was at the release of LS4EP3, Long Live the Lich, where noone could enter the new released map for a whole day until they eventually fixed it.
---
This is 100% subjective but here I go. I really don’t recommend male norn or any char thief. Everything seems slow, and I just can’t enjoy it.  I’ve spent a lot of gems because of that :-(
---
In my opinion, human, sylvari or female norn are great for a thief.
---
It is confused why you would play staff druid in open world
---
Imagine whining for a refund after spending $50 two years ago.
---
Don’t buy their crap then. Inform players how bad the QOL and features are without having to sink hundreds of dollars. Create a negative image surrounding the brand. Greed is the downfall of every company, especially if there are suitable replacements. And in the mmo genre there’s a dime a dozen.
---
Szczerze? Wątpię :P Ale tak swoją drogą, to polecam nie traktować solo kolejki zbyt poważnie. Ona nie ma za dużo wspólnego z prawdziwym PvP. Ot jest to dobre dla casualowego pogrania, 4fun, ale konkretne PvP jest tylko w przypadku kiedy gra drużyna na drużynę.
---
&gt; tight budget small gaming team
---
Its not about tight budgets or a small team, its all about management. Whoever is making the final decision is ruining GW2 and its been obvious for years now.
---
To make icons not jump around when weapon swapping/equipping bundles.
---
Characters can buy additional letters from gem store but the maximum number of letters they can have is 25. Future patches will slowly expand the maximum number of letters, so gem prices skyrocket each patch.
---
The time where epi hit your own zerg in wvw.
---
The China Version is p2w, that is the biggest difference, you can buy so much on the gem shop that is a reward for work in the normal game.
---
Ahh that sucks. You know it there’s any difference gameplay wise? Though I doubt I’ll play GW2 anytime soon on the China server.
---
Replace "bUiLd tEmPlAtEs" with "hAtErS" and you own post would apply to you.
---
I've played thief at the moment and underwater spear #5 was just simply unfair xD.
---
it was a long attacking animation that also dodged during the whole duration. The thing is, with the right traits , the initiative spent for the attack had already the time to get refilled by the time the animation ended. So I could spam it indefinitely as long as I didn't get any quickness buff xD
---
You're barking up under the wrong tree mate. I'm just here for the drama.
---
Biggest difference gameplay wise are the VIP status, basicaly optional subfee giving you some qol benefits. And theres a lot less players than on eu or na. Eu is most active.
---
No https://www.guildwars2.com/en-gb/news/developing-essence-manipulation/. This blog explains it.
---
Fgs #4 into the wall :)
---
Mesmer torch#4 was reworked once and the skill got instant recharge if you auto-attack (no need to hit anything) while stealthed. There was no reveal back then. It was the first, real, legitimate, permanent stealth in-game.
---
I wouldn’t consider it dying, my guild just had a bounty run of 70+ people. I randomly walked in on 20+ people RP-ing in a random bar in Divinity’s Reach. Any time of the day it seems like there are many people on every map I go on, When I start a new character there are at least 10 other people starting toons as well. I’d take the “game is dying” comments with a grain of salt.
---
Digging through the comments means that whomever responded to you obviously liked this topic enough to bother scrolling in the first place and accidentally come across this waste of bytes you call a response. You're not being clever for "pointing out" how your comment is "more interesting" than the topic op posted just like a school shooter isn't clever for thinking that they are attracting attention from people because they think their lives are too boring to interact with and they wouldn't have paid attention otherwise. People are capable of joining the conversation AND pointing out how much of an idiot you are you know.
---
Well there was a time when you could make revenant char on free to play accounts...
---
**Personally this is what I found useful. I'd rank em in order of my preference. The rest has not really inconvenienced me.**
---
**1)  Copper fed salvage-o-matic** 
---
**2.  More bank tabs. I'd say 3 total slots helps  so you don't have to log on to other characters as much, but the more the merrier up to a  point. I have 6 or 7, can't recall at the moment.** 
---
**3.  +250 material storage expansion. Just 1 extra was enough. After that, Characters as mules are probably more worth it to store excess mats and other stuff, instead of just mats.**
---
**4. Character slots as alts and Mules . I have 11 slots and gear 7 characters for active play. You'll definitely play more multiple alts, but I ended up only really playing 3 alot, 2 sometimes, 2 rarely, with the rest as mules.** 
---
**5. Share slots. Buy what you need for infinite gathering tools,**
---
**6.  Silver fed salvage-omatic and  Runecrafter salvage-o-matic . I'd get Silver First, or whichever is on sale first and grab the other one later.** 
---
**7. I thought about  Teleport to a friend  and it's probably useful for new players. If you're a vet, you'll have stacks of the 1 use ones built up, so I'd say useful and worth it.** 
---
**8. Infinite gather tools. If you don't care about looks or the faster gathering animation of some tools, the standard infinite tools with no glyphs go on sale quite a bit(all 3 for 1200, and you can probably get 3 glyphs for less then 200 gold). I just buy the glyphs off the tp. I'd say volatile and our unbound glyphs would be worth it for a starting player. Helps you gear and get stuff needed in game.  You won't be making your money back for these soon, but the convenience is worth it.**
---
**Not a fan of more bag slots. Never really noticed any inconvenience.** 
---
**I have  How to Dance Volume 1 and I like it, definitely worth it for me at least.**
---
i have seen all those arguments and some do have their merit and others obviously not, but i am not even trying to take on the debate of cash grab or not, my point is about their lake of response to not "freeloaders" (witch i personally dont consider anyone to be) but to paying customers as templates are not free
---
what at the core problem is to me is this disrespect to the people that support the game, that bought something that doesn't work as intended, that brings problems than solutions, and in light of that ask for an answer and get nothing, not even "ty for you money idiot"
---
I remember having withdrawal symptoms after playing the beta
---
yet they say "our community drives us" as they did on a live stage, i am not naive to expect them to care, but i would at least expect people to call them on their lies, and "the community" they speak up doesn't exist, it never did, not to them
---
https://youtu.be/oTLD-OJJ1Vk
---
My favorite
---
And you managed to miss the point that I don't give a fuck.
---
And yet you still commented and bitched about someone else making a valid point.
---
I didn't struggle. Like I've said it's possible to find a post interesting and also point out how obnoxious you are at the same time.
---
48% now
---
You can transmute a gathering tool to have the animation from a different one for the faster gathering. I use the unbound logging and mining appearance with the harvesting set to consortium sickle. Right now I have unbound glyphs in everything since I'm farming ascended trinkets for all the alts. and it adds up to less winterberry farming.
---
it was not my intention to call people anything, it was only to refer to a sub group of people that have a position that arena net cant do wrong.
---
also "whit knight" to me is not really a "name" but an attribute, it doesn't define a person but a set a views that a person might have, for all that is worth, i am sure i am a white knight as well but of consumer rights.
---
They already sold you revenant, they don't need to fix it.
---
not gem store related   
---
so they probably wont fix it
---
you still dont understand that i dont even argue with you,im just telling you CURENT META. 99% players gona look on that site,copy build and if you are not in META,they will not even talk with you. 250 is surely low and i had to leave 2 parties today with this number,bcs they died 20x in 100 cm. DH can precast traps and he can use those utilities,no1 saying that he gona use them,but if you are geting butfucked by mobz,they can take it. sadly there are not enough players to support  800 kp pt,so i guess  250kp will have to suffice.
---
&gt; I'm just here for the drama.
---
Not my fault you keep delivering
---
You're actually the one making the drama tho.
---
How? It's not like the first strike died after a few days, how would people who don't play on release get punished?
---
You're replying to a meme. I didn't actually tread your comment.
---
That's even better! :D
---
I didn't disagree with that. Lets not pretend you also said they can contribute and respond at the same time, which they didn't do, and is exactly what I pointed out.  That they didnt do it. So your attempt to "correct me" or "explain to me" failed. I'm happy you find value in contributing your time to me and my thread. It just proves my point that this was indeed more interesting and alluring to people. The more you add, the more I win. Do keep it coming. I'm revelling in it.
---
Popular opinion is volatile for gold because of trophy shipments. I have unbound in mine since I'm gearing up alts in ascended trinkets from season 3 living world and it takes an ungodly amount of unbound magic. Some folks use shared inventory slots to swap the tools around between characters. Does EU get the black friday sale spillover from the US? It might be worth waiting until the end of the month if that's the case.

We get minor discounts trough out the week and the biggest ones show up on friday, but its rarely something like 90% or anything crazy like that.
---
The increase of customers does happen but nobody is pushing or shoving people around..like..ever.
---
It's either the asura bunny lab in Metrica Province, or the hidden ledges atop SCAR in Tangled Depths.
---
It's always easy when one person is giving the answer. When you run a company one person doesn't give the answer. You read the feedback, which takes time, you parse the feedback which takes time, and you make decisions which take time. You discuss. You don't just throw out an answer.
---
On top of that, we have an episode of the living world coming out in a couple of days and presumably Wintersday coming out not long after that. All work in the company doesn't stop because people are angry on reddit, whether that anger is justified or not.
---
My guess is they will respond, but they haven't yet figure out how best to address the complaints.
---
All bugs are extremely high on the pipeline and require little to no additional coding and planning to fix.

I know this will be unpopular and probably downvoted, but I voted for Kiel.

The Fractal was the election issue for me. I didn't want to see the Abaddon fractal.
---
You bought something useless based on a vague statement that it might be improved and stops being useless.
---
I mean it would have been nice by Anet to give your a refund for sure.
---
But damn thats so 100% your own fault.
---
No one wants perfect balance. Imagine if every class did the exact same amount of dps, with the same utility and everything. Every class can do quickness, banners, spotter, might etc. 
---
Class identity and playstyle are a million times more important than mathematical balance. 
---
And of course the games isn't based around raids.
---
Just get both, now that they're on sale. If you can only afford one for now, get LS3. The maps are very different from each other, and all of them are gorgeous and fun to explore. You'll also get some nice skins and rewards, the Lake Doric leather farm, and by far the easiest ascended trinkets and backpacks with Bitterfrost Frontier. 
---
The masteries are mostly useless outside their respective maps, but you do get a couple movement masteries that can be used in future maps, as well as the fifth downed skill that can be used anywhere and will save your life many times in the future.
---
LS4 maps are also gorgeous, but are more heavily focused on events, achievements and collections. You'll get new optional mounts and much more useful masteries to go with them, upgradeable weapons and armor, and a sort of a pseudo-guildhall-home instance area which is a cool concept but honestly offers very little reason to visit much outside of collections. Some of my guildies absolutely love it as a relaxing place to hang out or duel friends though, so you might like it too.
---
Keep in mind that you can use gold to unlock the episodes too, afaik for about 200g per episode, so it shouldn't take too long if you actively set your focus on farming.

---
You can't have a keybindings guide for beginners and not tell people to bind Swim down. 
---
Underwater combat is HORRID without the swim down key because the only way to swim down without it is swimming forward while facing downwards.
---
With swim down enabled, you can keep the camera centered on the target and move in all 3 axis freely. 
---
WvW may be the only place in which people will do any PvP underwater, but it's still crucial to have the swim down key even for PvE.
---
I recommend using the same key for swim down, lock ground target and the second mount ability as it also makes the skyscale fly down.
---
&gt;I should have worded that better; we also got a set during war eternal. What would have been better to say is the amount of full sets of armors added to the game is few and far between compared to the amount of outfits, hats, packages, etc. Anet doesn't seem that interested in making armor sets anymore, especially high level ones.
---
Well sure, because to make a "set of armor" they actually need to make three full sets of armor, fitted to each of eight different body shapes. Compare that to an Outfit where they only need to make one type for eight bodies, or hats where they basically just make one. 
---
I've said elsewhere, one of the biggest changes they could make to the game to improve both player engagement *and* spending, would be to take on the difficult task of normalizing all armor weights in the game so that you can mix and match them at will. This would allow them to take any Outfit in the game and make it into mix and match armor.
---
I'd love if they did release more armor, but I totally understand why they don't, and can't particularly fault their decision given the existing options. 
---
But yeah, they need a way for open world players to get Envoy armor.
---
Also population wise EU is the best, NA second, and 中国 is pretty much dead according to the comments below some youtube videos. 是不是中国人? 不知道你为什么想玩儿中国gw2，这不恨好。
---
The main differences are more predatory monetization practices, less population, and CCP shenanigans.
---

I will not miss those traits.

---
Don't put words in my mouth that I did not utter.
---
You can play thief and abuse stealth, but you fail to truly master the class. You'll have success, but you fail against players who know how to combat stealth. You fail against anyone who just walks away.
---
A thief has to adapt a faster rate than any other class in the game due to the inherent flaws to their core ability to survive. This basis is why I stated players who rely on stealth fail at thief.
---
You can't adapt.
---
I think that you wrote the post in a calm manner and you are close to losing it, but you are self aware and controlling yourself from going full toxic like some of those people supporting you in the comments below. I think the best way to continue is to play the game regularly but not become too emotionally attached. I also noticed that some of us wake up and only think about guild wars, so it is understandable that they are so passionate about change because it is directly impacting their real life. 
---
Focusing on better life balance like work and non gamer friends can really help. As well as setting goals beyond the game. I notice when I talk about these things my friends just nod but don’t really think beyond it. They do love the game, but they don’t let it take over. It’s hard to explain but it’s the best way I can put it.
---
Wait you can white Knight a gaming company? Is anet a female? What up giiirrrrl.

A Lobby for strikes missions could be great, specially since the aerodrome is its own map and it could potentially be expanded. I'd love if there is a new room or even a 2nd floor added to the aerodrome with stuff for the strikes missions.

Game is peachy guys!!! It's just you toxic elitists that complain about everything, anet is just a small indie studio but the game is fine (tm)!
---
&gt;Especially in RPGs, super-especially in MMORPGs, properly conveying information is important, and stylized font should be reserved for stuff like fluff text.
---
To which the obvious rebuttal is that those of us who spent 7 years playing the first Guild Wars game liked its stylized UI font (Friz Quadrata) [just fine](https://www.farazjafari.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Guildwars-Tradinghub.jpg?x87173), so GW2 moving to such a plain font felt like a step backwards.
---
Besides GW1, Friz Quadrata is also the standard font for WoW, the biggest MMORPG of all time, although that game also uses the more "stylized" (and quite ugly, IMO) Morpheus font for quest/lore dumps in much the same way as TES uses Cyrodiil. Although in that game, if you don't like the fonts it's trivial to replace them in mods unlike the Guild Wars games where it's extremely difficult, maybe even impossible.
---
Well I guess it could be worse, if we absolutely had to get a Microsoft sans serif font at least it was Trebuchet and not [Comic Sans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_Sans)...
---
&gt;  I ended up doing most of them several times.
---
&gt;But you have a certain view of completion. It seems to me to be "speedclear to the end of the story mission once, log out, come back in three months." Fine, that can be your way to play, but understand as an absolute fact that plenty of other players do not play that way. They do not rush, they explore. They do not log out once they've reached the end of the story mission, they keep exploring, keep repeating open world events, keep collecting mats and achievements. They enjoy this. You do not have to, this is fine, but they are the ones that keep this game 
---
viable, whether you believe that it should be or not.
---
&gt;No, as we've established, you are only left with 2 hours of openworld content every 4 months. We are left with dozens of hours of open world events of various kinds for a month or two, then we move on to the nearest festival content or whatever until the next story mission drops.
---
&gt;It wouldn't, if that's how I played. But I don't play that way, so I get many times that much content out of their releases, and that is enough for me. If I were you, then I would have stopped playing the game ages ago, and stopped whining about it soon after. Like Anthem.
---
Once again:
---
&gt;As has been stated, because you enjoy counting the pixels on quagan assholes that does not actually make it content.
---
You doing the farm event on queensdale 80 times a day does not mean its month long content.
---
&gt;Words of wisdom.
---
No, words of fanboy customers with no respect for their time and money.
---
&gt;The first rule of good storytelling, break the rules.
---
In order to break the rules you need to actually bother establishing them in the first place. Gw2 introduces rules in the same chapter it breaks them, it lacks any sort of internal consistency or stakes.
---
&gt;Not every story chapter has hit with me, but some of them have been the most impactful I've played. The ending to A Star to Guide us hit particularly hard. 
---
So, how did you feel when the meaning of "sacrifice for your friends and cause" was completely undermined by aurene using the most obvious red herring in history to come back from a cheap death?
---
&gt;for the most part, yeah, but it was an interesting experiment. I hope they do more with it later. With LW development there tends to be a rolling dev period, so stuff they test out in one episode they can't just roll into the next because that one is almost finished already, so it can take a few more episodes for it to come back around.
---
What other stuff have they tested in lw exactly? 
---
&gt;I'm both skeptical and optimistic. I'm not saying that it alone would justify an expansion, but it might be a part of an expansion-worthy addition, like bouncing mushrooms, nuhoc wallows, or jackal portals. Again, if this experiment of theirs is "an expansion's worth of content as LW updates," then you wouldn't be able to judge that project by the first or second release. Only looking back on on the entire thing could you say whether the sum of what they delivered was worth an expansion.
---
lmao no
---
Bouncing mushrooms, nuhoc wallows and jackal portals are not "expansion worthy additions" they are sitiuational map gimmicks. Gliding is an expansion worthy feature, mounts are an expansion worthy feature.
---
Shitty map traversal gimmicks that are only usable from predefined locations are not.
---
&gt;I don't recall them saying so, but I am interested in seeing that interview for better context.
---
https://www.pcgamesn.com/guild-wars-2/pvp-raids-world-restructuring
---
http://prntscr.com/pxtpzz
---
&gt;They didn't announce the Essence/Raven Masteries then either, even though they must have been well into development by that point. 
---
Why would they announce these masteries? The essence/raven masteries are shitty sitiuational map locked gimmicks that will be forgoten 3 days after release, why are you treating them like they're the next gliding? 
---
Charr tail clipping is a more exciting announcement that essence/raven masteries.
---
&gt;Like I said, that's just my speculation, if it turns out to be true, I think that would be cool, if it turns out to not be true, like I said, I'm fine with the specs I got, so that wouldn't be a game-killer for me either way.
---
When you have no self respect or standards nothing is a game killer.
---
Yes, but that requires buying both the one with the glyph you want (a given in your case, as IIRC UM tools are sold as a bundle) as well as the one with the skin you want. Considering that unlimited tools are already not the highest priority for spending gems, I can't recommend double dipping like that for a newbie.
---
Honestly surprised no one has mentioned how fall damage worked for the first idk, year and a half of the game? If you just walked down an incline of a certain degree you could kill yourself in under a second.

I have a friend that runs fractals with me, another that used to but quit the game, and yet another that runs some days but not every day.

The longest one is about 3 and a half years
---
Season 2 (out of 10).
---
Story is pretty horrible.
---
Instances are awful.
---
Also Caithe sucks and i don't get why she's allowed to keep living (she's way more evil than faolain, but anet conveniently forgot it).
---
Man i would pay 2k gems for the option of murdering her. And people complain about traeharne/braham ROFL.
---
&gt; Again, you keep saying "stagnating," I keep saying "stable." 
---
Right, and my proof is the declining/stagnating revenue, the lack of updates in pvp, lack of updates in raids, lack of updates in fractals, lack of updates in wvw, dying raid community, dying pvp community dying fractal community, dying wvw community and sporadic updates.
---
Meanwhile your proof is "but I like counting pixels on quagan assholes so it counts as content and everyone who doesn't like it isn't relevant".
---
&gt;Stable is not bad, most games die off completely within the first few years, or sink to a much lower level than GW2 has before bottoming out. Seven years in, GW2 is making good money for a game of its scope with no established IP to work with.
---
&gt; no established IP to work with.

&gt;guild wars TWO
---
Forgot what game you were playing?
---
&gt;I didn't type that. You did. So I guess the question is to you?
---
Did you not get butthurt and try to throw my own comment back at me because you were too seething to come up with your own?
---
&gt;You can't measure games quantitatively.
---
Yes you absolutely can. Games take certain hours to go through all the content and have hours of replayability and/or rewards that gw2 lacks. 
---
The only reason you don't want to measure games quantitatively is because it shows how full of shit you are.
---
&gt;Hard to say. 
---
They've cut back on wvw, pvp, fractals, raids, abandoned dungeons and open world story updates come once every 4 months.
---
So no, not hard to say.
---
&gt;Again, you keep complaining about "no expansion," but they explained that they wanted to do a new LW season instead. 
---
How does that change the "no expansion" part? LW is not a replacement for expansions, its shitty filler until the expansions come.
---
&gt;Like I said, I don't need a new expansion if they content they produce is worthwhile. 
---
Their idea of expansion worthy content is cooking 500.
---
&gt;The prologue was a very good start.
---
A run of the mill open world map with 3 hours of content, no mastery and no legendary?
---
&gt;That you're confusing "revenue" for "profits?"
---
If they're cutting "worthless content" in order to put out "worthwhile content" should the fact that there's more "worthwhile content" increase customer satisfaction and therefore revenue?
---
its funny because i got the same reply lol =)
---
Ugh. I’m the friend now. It’s been almost a year. I want to go online but my guild had shrunk to almost nothing and I lost the excitement.
---
The logged off in pre-alpha, duh
---
a lot of people already join, i got like 10 alts perma parked there.  only use em for raids.
---
Again you are assuming things and putting words in my mouth. I'll kindly ask you to stop one more time.
---
Now I never said you can't use stealth nor that you can't succeed using it. I simply stated you can't master the class by playing that way. Stealth abuse is the 1st think a player does when picking up thief. It's been that way since the game released. It's the easiest way to extend your survivability on thief. 
---
That said people know how to counter you stealthing  w/out using reveals. What does one do in those situations if you aren't equipped to survive using other measures? So I say if you've never learned how to survive w/out relying on the beginner's tactic to survive can you truly master the class? The answer is no you can't master the class.
---
Conversely players who've moved past the beginners tactics of stealth to play thief haven't magically forgot how to utilize stealth to survive. I log on and I am shocked at how many players on thief can't HS 4x through BP after the nerf on controlling the distance of HS with camera control. So top tier players can abuse the stealth just as much as and in most times better than the thieves who refuse to let go of their crutches.
---
Now you go on further about top players and builds, but you didn't identify what you consider top players. I'd like to get your take on what you consider a top thief player and maybe an example of a player. Post a link their videos etc.
---
Again thanks
---
same :D
---
I wouldn't recommend spending any money on this game until Anet dials their scummy monetization back a bit. Look at all the complaints surrounding build templates, a feature requested since launch, which was released recently.
---
It do be like that.
---
I am the one offline. However I keep in touch on a daily basis with some of the friends I met in GW2 :D
---
it is one of the best solutions ive seen so far, the only game with a better solution is dota, where you get all the money and stuff from that player and also get increased income, so you get a huge boost to carry your team
---
Played through Crash Bandicoot N Sane Trilogy, Spyro Reignited Trilogy, Darksiders 1 and played a little bit of Path of Exile. I have Darksiders 2, Pillars of Eternity 2, Celeste, NieR &amp; Red Dead 2 next on the list. Also I'd like to replay Dark Souls 1 &amp; 3, The Witcher 2 &amp; 3 and GW1 campaigns some time. 
---
Apart from this I started reading Silmarillion (Tolkien) and Witch World by Andre Norton. Also I'd like to reread Witcher books before Netflix series.
---
Haven't touched Guild Wars 2 since Icebrood Saga annoucement. When ANet showed us what they prepared for GW2 I realized that no amounts of feedback and goodwill will make this game better. I've been playing for 7 years and I lost all hope for better future.
---
Tell 'em, this game is dead and they are bleeding wallets dry while the ship sinks
---
Tbh I find your approach sick.   
---
Everyone has their hobbies, true  
---
But your approach can be summed up as 'fuck your hobbies, do sth else and don't worry that a significant part of your free time is slowly dying'  
---
I don't see how playing games is any different from any other hobby, so there's no reason to have less involvement with that. Telling someone to take a break is not fixing anything. Because even if they take a break they might not have anything to come back to.
---
I remember the symbol bug, 5 guard dungeon roflstomps (even though it only sped fights up by about 2 seconds lol)
---
The "bug" where thieves are not effected by alacrity, although should they fix that there would be a small % chance of thieves entering the speedforce and travelling back in time
---
It’s not so hidden but the troll cave in Queensdale that you have to threaten to open.
---
Thanks for the compliment! I'm a Linux systems administrator, so outside of conference calls and trips to the server room I spend nearly 100% of my time at work staring at text. Much of my knowledge about fonts (officially "typefaces") comes from various web developers I've worked with in the past, it's "fun" hearing them bitch at each other about the right font to pick for various user interface features. I just have to make sure the server(s) stay up once they roll out their code :) 
---
If you want to become a font nerd like me, two great places to start are the movie [Helvetica](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/helvetica) or, since we're video gamers after all, the game [Type:Rider](https://store.steampowered.com/app/258890/TypeRider/) which, at only a few hours in length should be a brief, enjoyable diversion from your GW2 career. Have fun!

Triple Trouble was dying in seconds.

u/lordkrall - u here bud?
---
I'd like a new map similar to Aerodrome but not the Aeerodrome itself.
---
Because it's meta
---
I remember someone posted a video, I think on here, about doing CM 100 pug as condi and was usually pulling ahead. Like, I understand in super coordinated groups, power probably pulls ahead, but I don't have friends like that.
---
How about the old datamined Ascalon-themed Guild Hall instead? Map size was adequate (much smaller than regular guild halls)
---
A proper map as lobby is nice but not the aerodrome itself
---
As long as you know mechanics and are either top dps or close to the top, you’re fine. You can even do CMs with that build as long as you have the mechanics down and can keep up with damage.
---
In CMs I'd wager condi would work fairly fine. The only ones I think would give you issues is MAMA with knights (not much time to ramp up) and siaxx split. The rest you have plenty of time to ramp up.
---
Maybe, I do remember something similar but I'm not sure.
---
Also the fall trait from Mesmers dealing millions of damage haha
---
[this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnGDLKQr-ck)?
---
Cool story bro.
---
Pull the brake in a Porsche at those speeds and tell me what happen after you get out the hospital (if you don't die, which is very likely).
---
Pro tip: pulling the brake at 25mph is very likely to cause a crash. At 50+ is pretty much suicide. Please don't ever do that. EVER. for any reason.
---
Oh yeah maybe. Forgot it's SC so like, they're really good.
---
Which is sad, for me it was never even close to as major of a part of the game as GW1.
---
That one time they changed SAB ice floor physics, and it caused raid KC statues to run away from people.
---
Yeah i've played it with pugs and it works, assuming you know what you are doing you can compete with top dps, condi dps or quickbrand does start to fall behind when you start moving towards more experienced groups that phase very quickly,  however in the pug setting its very strong, especially as you will likely do t4s along with cms and it makes the more frustrating fractals such as sirens reef, pretty fun.
---
I'm using gw2hook and I think I haven't seen any AA settings. Did I miss it somehow, or it's only in reshade?
---
That would be awesome, because in-game aa is rly bad.
---
In beta epidemic would transfer condis to all mobs in the zone
---
The biggest problem S2 has is the fact you can’t really experience S1 anymore.
---
Not necessarily, they go largely unutilized by big guilds but smaller guilds I’ve been in hold guild meetings, gatherings, and event preparations in guild halls, often gathering the core group together at them to initiate new members as well.
---
Ok, yeah. That one is... yep... way more goonies.
---
That was me except shortly after PoF dropped. Was an officer in a couple big guilds. Top of the world. Then one day everything just wasn’t fun. Tried again recently but the magic is straight up gone.
---
They don't care
---
[deleted]
---
It should be on the same map as aerodrome, the whole point of aerodrome is that you don't have to changemap to acces all raid content, spliting it from aerodrome would also decrese the probability of new players stepping into a raid wing by accident and we don't want that to happen ;)
---
One of my guilds has been struggling to gather people for activities lately. This thread shows that the issue isn't unique to my guild. Meanwhile toxic casuals: stop crying and feel free to leave, game will do just fine without you :) :) :)
---
The [Borderlands cat cave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENIttdt-p5M) was a cute one.
---
&gt;Adjust pricing and call it a day.
---
unfortunately they will never be able to do that because people have already paid for them, those people will be outraged having already spent money. its too big for anet to go through the refund difference process.
---
I'd rather keep it in open world. I love the feel being in the map of the given strike mission.
---
Hope we get more gem store items!! /s
---
Kind of a shame, really. My friends and I played a _lot_ of GW1. The solid PvP and in-depth build making really helped it's longevity, though.
---
Oh trust me you can get your gems back if you escalate it. I've had them pull those same lines on me before for an item that I bought in the gem store that went on sale a day later.
---
Sometimes you gotta be a jerk about it and for something this controversial you can get it back.
---
I can't even really understand what you're trying to say much less figure out what's wrong.
---
From what little I do understand, seems to me you're not pressing space bar. The jump key.
---
The three new strikes, you can only play one of them each week, first week is the Kodan one.
---
I must belong to the odd middle class of people who play all game modes, sometimes quite seriously, so maybe I'm not the one to speak on behalf of "toxic elitists".. Yet I'm also not out of my mind to tell the casuals to leave. They're the overwhelming majority that funds the game.
---
That's me right now. Before logging on, is there *somehow* I can /age to see my last log in?
---
For PvP it really sucks that you have to kneel.
---
And while it does not matter for most of PvE there are some encounters where it does.
---
Or just grab the gen 1 legendary one and swap whenever.
---
That's what I did anyway.
---
Over all the axe is all around better not just for dps but also CC as the pull &amp; daze can screw over allot of enemies and make them easy for a group to cleave down.
---
That is alot of work for 1 fix
---
From my experience, difficult content is too exclusive in terms of skill and reward. Adding more reward to casual content, adding celestial infusions to non-cm’s for instance, would anger the hardcore community but leaving it as is angers the casual community. It’s a very weird line.
---
I mean it probably would save us some time :\^)
---
My thought exactly. Tired as hell of this “dead game” shit. You are dissatisfied. The rest of us get it. You have good reasons to feel that way but give it a rest. Create r/gw2deadgame and fsck off over there.
---
Honestly, this is one of the most satisfying legendaries to attempt. The achievements involved are such a pain in the ass, that by the time you're done with it, you truly feel satisfied.
---
One of the rare instances where I think time gates work out tbh.
---
Let's put a rollercoaster right in the middle or a trampolines all around with the tech we have already.
---
You can't buy Marauder exotics. You have to craft them or select stats on gear without prefix.
---
And yeah, idk where reapers fit in really. They aren't *that* roamer friendly and it's not meta right now. If you're going roaming, I would look into core necro instead.
---
&gt; physical through pulling the e-brake
---
That seems like a terrible, terrible idea
---
Guild Wars 2: A Realm Reborn?
---
I would be totally fine with it picking a direction. It is an awful feeling starting a raid group and people don’t even know what stats they are wearing. It is equally awful trying to get into a raid group but getting kicked for not having experience or enough kill proof. I feel like appeasing a single community would help a lot.
---
If you're not playing "competitive" GvG than don't worry about having the perfect stats on your armor. Try to get in touch with the class, learn about positioning yourself correctly, anticipating and executing movement  and not wasting your cooldowns mindlessly. When you're doing this i guaranty you your will be better than 95% of the remaining players. 
---
While doing constant WvW collect as much wvw tickets as you can to work towards crafting legendary armor piece by piece. You don't need to grind much for the materials. The most time consuming part are the limited tickets per week.
---
Leveling is fun, level up gives us that small bit of satisfaction were looking for. When you get max level from the start, you get the initial excitement but now you're like "now what"?
---
Even in games like diablo where leveling to max takes literally seconds, they still implement paragon level so people can endlessly level up
---
Better to extra work beforehand than having this bugs pop every now and then.
---
The only one near me is inside an airport, pretty sure it's past the security check point. I was tempted to call and ask if they would mail me some, if I sent them a self addressed stamped envelope...
---
Versus DYING?
---
If I was to go for a legendary axe, I'd be wanting Astralaria rather than Frostfang.  And having just made Exordium on a whim a couple of weeks ago, my gold and materials tab can't handle another Legendary right now. ;)
---
But yes, when you mentioned that the Axe winds up doing more power damage than the sword, the pull is what immediately came to mind as "this makes it better".

Reaper is meh in WvW you'll want to play scourge which you can do power scourge in berserker gear just whack on a scepter and either wh, torch dagger
---
Pulling the ebrake in a car going 50+ (presumably you wouldn't pull it until after your friend was speeding) would substantially increase your odds of dying, not decrease them
---
Two things they mentioned in the livestream were that the strikes were going to be of different difficulties and that the rewards for the strikes were the same across the bosses, so people don't miss out if they miss a week. The Boneskinner would be the hardest one. If all of the strikes were available all the time, then no one would do Boneskinner and just farm the easiest one. Having it rotate forces players to engage with the harder content.
---
Zojja is to prideful to have us watch her learning how to talk and walk again.
---
Yeah, we already saw how the alternative turned out.
---
The richness of the maps is the greatest treasure in GW2
---
I play condi fb in CMs and am almost always top. If you like it and really get good at it, no one will say anything to you. 
---
However, I also never join groups that specifically ask for power dps.
---
It's been a bit more than 28 days since Heart of Thorns
---
I mean sure, if you can see the future then by all means pull the ebrake
---
Yeah. I wish Anet just would say it out loud. The realist in me knows it'll never happen though, hardcores and allies are welcome to leave whenever they deem it's been enough..
---
Normal T4 players will likely tell you pow quickbrand is better, dont listen. If you run CMs, you will see plenty of condi qb pulling insane numbers and also providing all the quickness you need. In fractals, you dont need as much boon duration as raids since you get free boon duration from your fractal pots. On top of this, almost all of condi qb damage comes from burning, which usually is fast enough to get full or near full damage in during a burn phase (compared to say bleeding or poison based builds). This together means that condi qb plays almost like a pure dps, and that dps is totally viable in even the highest dps groups. (Note as well: most non-CM T4 groups have absolutely terrible DPS, so even if pow qb has some edge in burst fights, you likely wont have much burst from your group, and therefore, with the longer fights, condi qb will do all the better.)
---
&gt;I don't think is that hard to understand.
---
I understand why they’d want the skips but at the same time, these are the exact same people who do stuff like clear a raid on day 1 of release and then complain that there’s absolutely nothing for them to do. But even if they weren’t it sucks for everybody else when the game doesn’t even ask you if you want a fully leveled character or not when you buy an expansion and just leaves it available for you. I’ve seen **way too many** brand new players “just try it out” and end up gimping the whole game for themselves because they don’t like not being able to participate in the latest content.
---
I still stand by what I’m saying, the option to pay for a level cap is one of the leading causes for the decline in MMO engagement.
---
Tell me more about the drama
---
But you are Not required to use the app in order to get the game-code
---
I wouldn't call this the "white knight" defense so much as the "realities of large-scale game development" defense, but whatever. First, regarding the timeframe, it's true that the exact extent of the system has been publicly known for about a month and a half, but the system has only actually been out for about two and a half weeks, just 13 business days if you don't count the patch day itself. As it would be almost comically unprofessional of the devs to start making changes a full month before launch, based on feedback to the outline rather than the system itself, the longer time isn't a very good representation of what's going on here.
---
Second, consider this: in order to make any major changes beyond bug fixes, the devs will need to:
---
* Gather player feedback (which they have done)
---
* Sort out the actually useful feedback from what is no doubt a small mountain of unhelpful complaints and clearly unworkable suggestions
---
* Figure out what sort of changes they can and/or should make to address the issues, if any
---
* Get said changes approved by any other departments or managers required
---
* Possibly repeat the previous two steps several times if initial ideas aren't accepted for whatever reason
---
* Develop and build whatever changes are approved
---
* Rigourously test their new build before launch (quite a bit more than they would need to for less volatile systems, as player inventory is something that they are *extremely* careful with, and rightly so)
---
All of this can and does take *a long time*, particularly in a larger studio like ArenaNet. Just ask anyone who works at a large company with multiple departments and levels of management - heck, at my job it recently took me several weeks to get some minor layout and formatting changes to a spreadsheet we regularly use implemented, and that only had to go through two or three other people who were already in favor of the idea. Any sort of meaningful change to the template system is going to take at least a few months to come out, possibly longer, and while that absolutely sucks it's also entirely reasonable. It's also preferable to the alternative; I'd rather wait three months for a fix that works properly than three weeks for a fix that has a 0.01% chance (small enough that they might miss it in testing, but large enough that players will likely encounter it within hours, if not minutes, of launch) of deleting your gear when you try to change templates.
---
Rigorously test their new build before launch (quite a bit more than they would need to for less volatile systems, as player inventory is something that they are we'll hopefully see some fixes with the major patch this Tuesday. Whether or not that was the right call, given the circumstances, is debateable, but it's not like they're actively ignoring either the bugs or the players. ANet has responded to negative feedback with changes and improvements in the past, and I see no reason for this to be any different - and if they don't, rest assured that I'll be among the first to call them out for it.
---
Let's be honest here, the VA is the reason why they haven't used Zojja recently. Just change the voice actor. It's not hard, and is probably cheaper. Why they want to cling onto Felicia Day is beyond me.
---
&gt; porting jumping puzzles
---
You called?
---
“Developers made me quit” Amen!
---
It’s been over 2 years since PoF came out. Back when a fan player made that April Fools joke with the underwater expansion. I got so excited, it’s been almost a year, and we got a dragon. 
---
Before I quit the game I told myself I would explore all of the content.
---
Aurora
---
Vision
---
Legendary Armor
---
Legendary Weapons (1st and 2nd generation)
---
Open the whole map
---
Level all the different classes
---
295 Mastery
---
Now what? Developers won’t take anything in consideration, they just ignore players, unless you open your wallet, and a lot of people complaining.
---
And you are representing all players?  not a single person I've ever raided with has had these problems your claiming.  I've been using arc and raiding with people who use it for years.  
---
Your making up bullshit to try to make Anet's templates not look as bad.
---
Pretty soon they are gonna put that table on top of another table.
---
It was pretty straight forward. I was an officer in EVA. One day the guild imploded because someone got kicked due to being disliked by another officer. A bunch of us broke off and formed EMP, Empowered Synergy I think it was called, honestly can't recall. Half the group I did fractals with left with us, half stayed behind.
---
I'll do you one better. I physically went to Bitterfrost to try to find it on my own and failed to do so. But thanks for the directions Mr. Google
---
Wasn't there a gemstore outfit that crashed people around the wearer?
---
&gt;Hardcore players get bored due to anet's godawful raid release cadence and lack fractal cm's, not because they have the option to insta lvl 80 a toon.
---
Maybe they should be playing WoW which has become more dungeon and raid centric, or FFXIV which was dungeon and raid centric from the very start and has only released more of that content. They won’t though, you know why? Because GW2’s dungeon and raid content isn’t that difficult, these people wouldn’t be considered hardcore in literally any other game. They want to stick to easy street and complain that they’re not getting more of that kind of content from a game that doesn’t try to be a vessel for that content. GW2 is a game that panders to players who want to play MMO’s, not to people who want to play dungeon crawlers and raid crawlers with a lobby.
---
What Guild is that? Lol
---
fans of felicia day like me want her to return, and she has stated on facebook that she would love to return
---
Well not necessarily, she's stated she is happy to reprise the role and was waiting for ANet to make the call actually, unless you mean financially but I don't know that Felicia Day would cost more than Nolan North and Troy Baker for example or quite a few of the actors they have actually, unless she asks a hell of a lot for some reason.
---
I think it probably just is a matter of scope with the episodes really, they're in an unfortunately comfortable position were she certainly isn't required for anything happening and there is a convenient reason not to have her appear.
---
Until they have solid plans for her to actually do more than just be a part of the story for her characters histories sake and the characters we still have around us then I don't see them really having the budget or time to throw in more than just off-hand references to what's going on with her, saying all that I'd actually be happy for more info on it even if it was just text box stuff from a character in a new patch and I think most people would be fine with that actually.
---
Hopefully they have a little fun with it, perhaps having her send us a mail at some point explaining her absence or allowing us to ask certain Asura what they know about it so we can piece things together ourselves.
---
Yes but kneeling is an integral part of the flavour of the skill. It's supposed to be a big hit that enemies can counterplay. The DPS might not be there to sell that but then buffing the dps or adding other modifiers should be done instead.
---
It's the same for skills like Prime Light Beam, Meteor shower, empower etc.. The ability is more powerful than it would otherwise be, because it has a restriction. In this case the damage just needs to be increased.
---
GW2 is already lacking flavour on a lot of skills. And mobility is so abundant everywhere else, that having a few abilities that force you to be rooted is important.
---
...Uh.. what stops you from trying to make a male Nord and checking out body types for him? I remember some lean options there. Just go and take a look.
---
For the longest time I thought Taimi and Zojja were the same character because Zojja completely dissapeared out of nowhere
---
The one thing I do appreciate is that they said they wouldn't be shoving RNG based rewards into this story patch. It's my biggest gripe with Grothmar; I love the shoulders but I can't afford to buy them off the TP :/
---
That and I'm kinda excited for the Boneskinner tonic they mentioned. I doubt it'll be a combat tonic but it'll still be fun to run around as that beautiful monster.
---
True, but when you have system that works as well as /u/deltaconnected version of templates, maybe you should implement it in a similar way, and i'm sure there'd still be a way to monetize it if that's so important.
---
Also as we know TP and gemstore are just ingame browsers, so who knows if hero panel isn't as well. If it is then it's nothing more than an "overlay".
---
And as much as we know and understand there's a lot of legal business before they can give a response at least give us a response that tells us that and not just were looking at what you're writing and then go silent for 2 weeks.
---
Norn males are huge, muscled men.  It's just what they are in lore.  You can try to browse through the body types and there might be one that's more fat than muscled, but 'big' is basically the Norn thing.
---
The wolf form really isn't a good skill to use, so if that's the only reason you're considering Norn and you dislike everything else about them, you're probably better off picking a different race.  Even when you do get that (bad) skill, it's something you can only activate for a brief time, so you'll be spending most of your play time looking at your beefy Norn male.
---
The game's not dying.  Some veteran players are upset with various things, but those are veteran player issues.  If you haven't played for 4+ years, there's a ton of new content waiting for you, so it'll be quite some time before you get to the same complaints they have!
---
Sweet. See you in-game!
---
better rework fall damage soon...
---
Everytime I hear this I laugh at the one who posts this. Pure armchair psychology nonsense.
---
The problem is that you get Drytop and Silverwastes for free anyway, so season 2 isn't as valuable as season 3 or 4 (or 5 will be), since you're just getting the story and achievement related rewards.
---
Currently those who use different gear for different stats can store different appearances in their equipped gear so they can see visually they have different stats as there's no UI element telling you the current gear loadout selected.
---
That cannot be done with legendary gear in different slots, they'll have the same appearance in all slots.
---
They just need to add a queue feature in the UI somehow. Strikes are beefy or deep enough to warrant a lobby place. They're meant to be fast and quick. There is a reason why the public queue option died and LFG is the way to find groups for strikes.
---
This is not a record tho. last time I checked arselkow holder the record.
---
I'm usually the first one out. Then I'll come back years later by myself and I'll usually play for longer, but get burnt out in 2 - 3 months at most.
---
This is a complaint I see from my friends who dont see statics, you dont have to, just need to wait for groups a bit longer (or really, just form your own to play what you want). But condi quickbrand is superior, so totally fine to want to play it.
---
1. Enhanced burn guardian has is power levels of burst 
---
2. F1/5 is basically cheating your way to top burst in encounters
---
 
---
Hello guys,
---
After few years, I am considering coming back to the game. Can you give me a brief summary of what has change since HoT? Is the game leaning towards casual playing or no-life'ing now?
---
Also, are there any active, casual friendly guilds around?
---
EDIT: is it worth to buy deluxe / ultimate version of PoF?
---
Thanks :)
---
Perhaps i do, "getting people on voice chat for raid" is still the hardest boss of raids dispite being in game since HoT relese ;)
---
Condi firebrand does pretty good dmg, but offers no cc (or the dmg buff which you get when you use the bane signet with the proper trait). So in normal T4 groups where you can run pretty muc what you want it's good to carry low dmg groups. In cm groups with high dps the bane signet buff makes power FB more worth it
---
It's not a problem caused by build templates, it's a problem not addressed by build templates.
---
Legendary gear is very expensive, so it should give benefits accordingly. If people have to get ascended gear on top of legendary, what's the point of legendary being able to store different stats in different loadouts?
---
yeah same here, you rarely make any serious connection with other players, which kind of baffles me since this is  supposed to be an mmo
---
&gt;Ascended gear(after all the promise of horizontal progression)
---
And they kept their promise after that. I wouldn't even consider legendary to be a straight up upgrade, just the same tier with added functionality. So you're already factually wrong.
---
Except that legendary gear does store different stats for each loadout. It's ascended gear that doesn't store different stats, its very much static. 
---
Do you not see the benefit of having 6 pieces of legendary armor vs crafting 36 pieces of armor, that need to be stat swapped whenever you want to change your build?
---
This is a fictional problem.
---
Heal ren is a terrible fractal healer though. You might as well just play full dps then. Condi qfb loses the signet share and cc which is quite huge in high dps groups but for average pug that doesnt matter that much. Average pug ren has 4k boss dps aswell for some reason but if phases become really short or the fb can play dh condi falls behind a lot. This rarely happens in pugs though.
---
Yes, but no appearance, making legendary gear worse in that regard.
---
But legendary gear should never be worse in any regard, that's the point of legendary gear. So it has to be fixed.
---
WP did a video on it:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Niz4fkeBs2s
---
Not sure that's as comparable. To me, this game is losing out due to not providing anything interesting anymore. Grinding a new map every month or two hasn't been fun, and learning a new build every balance patch gets old too (especially with unnecessary nerfs). Steam has more competition now, but gaming in general isn't dying... And maybe it could be that some of us are getting older and don't have the time, hah.
---
I don't know why pugs don't do this, make your alacrigade heals, make your quickbrand condi, everything is much smoother
---
At least holo is good for something in pve
---
Well then craft more legendary gear and transmute it to your hearts content. 
---
I don't get why you think legendary gear needs to transmuted for free. Your ascended gear isn't being changed by your gear template its just loading in another piece of armor. So if you want all the benefits then the solution to your made up problem is to craft more legendary gear. One for each gear template you have unlocked.
---
Not sure that accounts for a lot, but I definitely get that method when playing pvp.
---
Expecting anyone to do that is simply absurd.
---
And I didn't say it should get different appearances for free. In the link I gave, I gave examples on other ways to do it, like custom outfits and allowing linking each custom outfit to a loadout so they change together.
---
I still like Skyhammer...
---
You stayed true my friend, no shame in that. Continue playing and keeping the community alive!
---
A GW1 classic relaunch is all i need.
---
I really like the feeling of the world being full of people!
---
Might be because it's a sequel to a game that played in an era of actual guild wars. 🤔🤔🤔🤔
---
Just a hunch.
---
One of my guilds died, so I found a new one with tons of people online.  People come and go, make new friends.  This is the way it is in any game.
---
Despite what a lot of redditors are saying, the game isn't actually dead yet; there's definitely still a population of players still creating new characters and exploring content, even if some of the people who started playing 7 years ago have started dropping off.
---
Hope you're enjoying sliding back into the game :)
---
Thanks for the thoughts :)
---
Currently i'm exploring one zone at a time while doing story on 1 character only. The goal is to reach lvl 80, follow the story and fully explore all maps connected with the story (friend told me the zones should connect with each other all the way to the high lvl zone).
---
So far i'm enjoying it a lot. The combat is sooooo fluid, the movement and jumping so precise and responsive, there are a TON of people hanging around, I've seen a lot of new players running around exploring along side me and some dynamic events were really fun.
---
Like a boy showed up and told me to go in a cave to play with his friends.
---
His friends are playing pretend of some big heroes i assume and are asking me about my knowledge of those heroes (i got no idea about them). After people filled the progress bar the kids started going "in character", running around being all brave till a scale showed up and they just scattered :D
---
&gt; Letting legendary gear save different skins per build.
---
Is what you said, you didn't say having custom outfits per loadout. 
---
I know this is a fashion thing for you. You want to be able to have 6 different "appearances" for your character and you want them to be functional in 6 different ways. 
---
But you know what, the people who actually have 6 different appearances in their loadouts actually have 36 pieces of armor and not just 6. 
---
Thinking that legendary gear should have free transmutation charges because of gear templates is the true absurdity.
---
Some veterans that have played the game for years seem to forget that new people come into the game all the time.  But they look at their friends list and think the game is dead because someone from years ago isn't playing anymore lol.  Wow people come and go, shocker.
---
You should.
---
If you haven't tried or completed all raids, you still have contents to play! Those are fun stuff you're missing out on
---
I do them every day.
---
Tyria is always full of life =)
---
The beauty of Guild Wars 2 is that you can take a break at any time if you want and when you come back you can pick up where you left off without ever feeling that you were behind the other players.
---
I will.
---
Gosh, how I wish I could screenshot that dude in Amnoon Oasis bragging about being able to kill things on his power mirage using greatsword, but freaking out because anyone in mapchat who gave him advice was "elitist".
---
I never say thta. I said it should be possible to save different appearances in different loadout slots, so it can do what players can do with ascended gear.
---
I didn't say it should be free, or not require "apeparance slots" that also have to be purchased, or that it should not take transmutation charges to save different appearances.
---
All I said is that there should be a way to legendary gear to do what can be done with ascended, without getting more legendary gear.
---
Don't forget before everyone was their own blinding star with stupid overdone effects everywhere. It actually had a style then.
---
&gt; ay it should be free, or not require "apeparance slots" that also have to be purchased, or that it should not take transmutation charges to save different appearances.
---
Dude I copy pasted what you said. There's nothing you can't do with legendary gear that can be done with ascended. And the real kicker here is that you don't want to get more legendary gear.
---
Imagine if you said this. "I want to save different appearances in each of my gear tabs without getting more ascended gear."
---
How do you solve that problem right there?
---
Yeah you might get more enjoyment from a charr. They're not really wolves but you might be able to get close (with horns though of course)
---
Just replace the VA really if that's the issue, wouldn't be the first time
---
&gt;however arcdps templates were a read memory/overlay system, and anets designs were directly coded into the game. they were incompatible
---
As a end user of templates I really don't care how the saussage was made. If it brings higher quality (features) there is really no reason for the bad quality expensive variant from anet. You basically pay for a worse product just because it has the official stamp slapped on it.
---
A large reason for that I think is that GW1 heavily promoted party play and people actually communicating to form said parties. Guild Wars 2 always had an every man for himself feeling to it, other players were pretty much NPC allies when you needed a group to kill anything.
---
First of unless you have a proper save/load function, we arent talking about templates. These are loudouts. Templates give you the option to "hard save" a build, even if you tweak it, even if u just change 1-2 pieces of gear or runes or move them to another character, as soon as you press that load button and the gear is in your inventory (they should have made them account wide instead of inventory based) the originally saved build will automatically equip. THESE ARE TEMPLATES.
---
This is what arc offered. Free, limitless, proper templates at a push of a button. Deltaconnected managed for free to do it while a bunch of paid game devs completely missed the mark. Do you remember the guy that created the first dota maps a decade ago? Guinsoo? Ye did that stuff for free. Then riot hired him and revamped that "custom map" into league of legends.
---
Anet should have just hired deltaconnected to do their job for them as they dont seem to be able to handle it properly.
---
It's okay. There are some interesting fights and moments, (one fight in particular has a challenge mote that I really enjoy).   
---
Also, if you need core tyria masteries then LS2 is the easiest way to get them.
---
No, you're fine. This Strike Mission mostly teaches you to group up and stay grouped, and to spot the animations of major attacks. As long as you can clump together, you're mostly fine. Your guild might up the difficulty a bit by not bringing a healer, then you're required to also avoid all the smaller attacks. But that's unlikely.
---
No the first one is easy we don't know how hard the new ones on Tuesday will be
---
I left GW2 back in June after playing since pre-release. I feel highly incentivized to spend ludicrous amounts of money on the cash shop to properly enjoy the game and decided that wasn't healthy for me.
---
Moved onto FF14. I pay a sub fee every month but it's costing me waaaaaay less overall because the cash shop is completely unnecessary. I enjoy the game the way it is.
---
You can see events on the map by default in an orange outline or orange icons. It should be in the settings (?) Or should be there already. The only thing map completion earns is some items to create legendary weapons with.
---
Problem is, even thought I agree a new gameplay/mechanical change for Scourges isn't necessarily the issue itself, those changes aren't currently consonant with the elite spec. Many of its traits are dependent on, very simply, casting shades at things - or, even simplier, casting a shade. They don't work at all as the focal points of strategical gameplay that they - I assume - were supposed to be; they serve merely as secondary, static placeholders for an actual (mostly offensive) skill to take place, either passively or actively.
---
If this "patch" came as an actual rework and changed the scourge's traits such that they work accordingly to this new gameplay direction (e.g. making [Blood as Sand](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Blood_as_Sand) grant reduced incoming damage for standing on a shade, rather than by spamming them), I would perfectly agree; I think it's perfecly fine for Scourges to trade its mobility for such tremendous versatility. But how can you push for this new gameplay with traits that favour another? This sincerely feel like a temporary - so I hope - disablement of the class.
---
you realize that its full only,bcs its on megaserver and all ppl playing on one map most of the time?
---
Why do you care about what other peoples responses are? Every person have their own opinion why do this bother you? I mean how will you deal with life in avrage when people do not want or feel the same thing as you do? Do you force them? Do you accept them anyway? Are you able to agree to disagree?
---
Imo the only thing that is important for you here is your opinon and A-Nets opinion. This give you options to make decisions that feel good for you. What ever those are is only up to you to decide about.
---
except for mounts, masteries and elite spec. yes, it's more. story, maps, events. it's way more.
---
No future, but you still here lol, sure.. gw2 still the best mmorpg out there. Not so hard to change sub r
---
It's more about content. Hardcores are legitimately pissed because there's no content for them anymore, all focus is purely on living world and gemstore. Casuals are openly gloating and telling hardcores to be grateful for what we get now. Here you go, how to split the playerbase 101.
---
Well you also get either transmutation charges or BLC keys with map complete.
---
They're easier to find, but not necessary to complete any map. Events are triggered based on what's going on in the map and depending what time it is. Sometimes if an event fails it'll go on cooldown and won't start again for a while. Usually you can see the direction of any events on your minimap.
---
I don't think you decide what is worth for someone and what not.
---
You have maybe 4 years of content ahead of you. But beware, a good portion of that content is locked behind living stories. There is a good discount on those packs at the moment that i would recommend. The maps are still played because there is many achievements and objectives across all the maps.
---
You have to enable the content guide, and disble story.  
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Options#User_Interface
---
When the content guide is set to Events and map, but no story, it will point to the nearest event if there's any in range.
---
Until you complete the map, it may point to an incomplete point instead.
---
It does make a difference in a good way. Look at WoW. They have the same sorta of idea with realm sharing and phasing zones together, but the game is always empty. While GW2 has mega servers where they just put everyone on the same servers over only a couple of them. It makes the game more lively and zones more active.
---
If you ever reach a point were you want to make the first generation of one of the legendary weapons you can make the mapcompletion then. Does not matter what level you are or when you do it. So if it is boring stop doing it and do stuff you enjoy.
---
Well, glad you're enjoying yourself. It sounds like you've already got some people supporting you, which is great, but if you have any questions and they aren't available feel free to drop me a line.
---
Thats what i'm saying. They don't use the same model. There are differences in posture and visible information such as the direction of the chest, arms, face and neck that don't line up between pictures. Sure superficial elements like patterns and attachements might have been copied over. But the character themselves is a seperate drawing, not a redrawing.
---
I left shortly after launch because end game didn't exist. The past year we have been in a similar predicament. End game exists now, but hardly any players are playing wvw, pvp or raids these (for NA) these days
---
&gt;Moved onto FF14. I pay a sub fee every month but it's costing me waaaaaay less overall because the cash shop is completely unnecessary. I enjoy the game the way it is.
---
Would you recommend ff14 over wow and gw2? I'm losing interest in the game right now. I tried the elder scrolls online but the game is like 100 gb of space and the graphics are like 😣😣.
---
Taken! Thanks alot :)
---
That’s a very reductive way of looking at what it means to level up and I don’t really have to energy to write paragraphs about why for somebody who probably doesn’t care. 
---
When you look at a video game as a series of gated content because you can’t look past the zeroes and ones, they stop being fun. Saying what you said is like saying “dungeons and dragons is, is a bunch of people sitting around a table doing math and moving hunks of plastic on grid paper.” Like technically you’re not wrong but if that’s how you see it, of course you’re never going to enjoy it. 
---
If your instinct is to suck all of the fun out of things that other people enjoy, then maybe those things just aren’t made for you. If all GW2 is to you, is a grind for loot, then maybe it just wasn’t developed with you in mind.
---
Whoever opened a very specific panel, crashed and couldn't reconnect  in PvP until the match was over (think it was friendlist?). 
---
People in would try to bait others on the enemy team into checking their friendlist so they would DC.
---
Another one is the ranger spirit heal one. When you used the chain skill of the spirit, there was a ~4 second window where you could keep spamming the skill and it'd heal you every time it was pressed. Rangers were unkillable even by 5 players unless someone literally oneshot them, because they'd heal like 40k per second.

Anet spent more time adding more invisible walls in Divinity's Reach, than fixing wvw mounts in order to prevent them being used for exploits such as breaking into tier 3 objectives (still, even to this day it is possible).
