Commenting to probably watch this later. Been like... probably two years but I used Engi to cheese towers due to large amounts of AoE knockbacks. I guess thumper doesn’t work anymore so it wouldn’t be as useful anyways. There is the uh, explodey boy tho. Blast gyro, shield 4, and big ol bomb work well, stealth gyro and smoke fields for stealth to get there without CC.

Curious to see how it goes on Mesmer as I’ve been out of it for a long while.

Your expectations for GW2 casuals and GW1 casuals are just way too different, dude. Let's use GW2E for a rough comparison. 109,226 linked accounts have the Traveler achievement, or 5 points in the HoM. 8,932 have Legend of the Mists unlocked, or 45 points in the HoM. In other words, I had more HoM points than 92% of the GW2 players who played GW1. It's actually worse than that because I was close to max on most of the titles I was missing. You were able to carry people who couldn't use their skills properly in GW1? Congrats, you can do the same thing in GW2. Maybe you're not good enough at GW2, just like I wasn't good enough at GW1.
---
On top of that, your expectations for GW2 design are nigh impossible. Sure, perfect content would be accessible and fun to everyone. But that will not happen. Realistically, you just need to accept that they need to make different content for different players. If you're upset about the amount of content for small teams (I think that's what you were talking about in another comment in this thread), don't take it out on raids, because they just aren't where a lot of the resources in the game go. The largest issue with content development in this game is their focus on content that isn't designed for replayability. The more players like you bitch every time there's content for PvP or WvW or raids or anything you don't like, the worse off the game is as a whole.
---
You remember when GW2 was trying to run a competitive scene with Pro League and such, right? Well, Pro League had issues due to the balance team (Bunker Chrono permanently marred it), but it still more than paid for itself by their own metrics (they had metrics of view converting to game purchases and stuff like that). Originally, they were advertising the stream for each weeks match ups in the game launcher. They stopped that because it was too upsetting to PvEers that PvP had anything going on when they were experiencing a content drought. They stopped advertising something that was pulling more resources to the game for everyone (and the money came from the advertising budget, so it wasn't related to the PvE content drought) because they couldn't stand others having content they didn't enjoy. The fact is, this game needs different kinds of content to maintain a healthy player base.

Teapot is doing raid guides, albeit slowly.
---
But unlike ALL other decent melee classes it lacks mobility.
---
This has been my method so far and I'm at 10k Taffy...
---
1.Hit pinatas each day until they no longer produce Taffy.
---
2. Complete dailies as they reward Taffy and coffers. Every 5th day you get a chest from the "Party Commander" that has 5 Jorbreakers as a selection option.
---
3. Stampede is an option but it seems rather inefficient in terms of time and waiting in between rounds so I don't bother.
---
3. Dragon arena is an option and far more efficient if you can get a group that can kill each boss below 2 min, otherwise it's also a bit of a waste.
---
4. Farm gold elsewhere and buy Taffy. It's far more efficient than farming coffers for Taffy by a Longshot...
---
I consume Glint facets all the time.
---
I never said there wasn't. There's just nothing revealed. If there is none then it's going to be effectively stagnant population wise. If there is one then hopefully there will be a population injection or at least get some players to return.
---
Thanks for answering, i will try and experiment then
---
I was speaking skritt...thank you very much!
---
As much as I like the caldera, imma have to pass on this just like the warclaw pack until we have selectable licenses
---
Thanks, i'm currently using that build, i will try it ASAP or create necros since i have level 80boost
---
Thanks for the tips, lots of encouragement from you guys make me pumped out to try it haha :D
---
Herald is amazingly fluent for all PvP modes. In WvW hammer herald is probably the smoothest zerg class with amazing spike damage and defensiveness. Not every day can you find a build running zerk/scholar and surviving in guild and open field fights. PvP burst is insane and apparently will be nerfed soon? Maybe that's just a rumor though, haven't kept up with it.
---
Podcasts, lore videos and occasional stream-VODS in the background.
---
Only exception is the woodenpotatoes lets play of core tyria... It was simply to high value to ignore it.
---
but...you’re the only one flipping out for no reason..?
---
Honestly I just want the OG storm daggers back. They were elegant without being over the top. Need them back in my life
---
I think you meant "Surprise Mechanics!"
---
It's for dramatic effect go show everyone what bullshit the issue is in general
---
except it only serves to “stir the pot” and start some sort of petty controversy debate
---
Lmao right.  You need economics 101.  And a philosophy check on what it is you're actually "doing" when you game.
---
Let me guess - the male Sylvari is just as pale as the rest of your characters but stayed outside for 5 minutes after forgetting to apply sunscreen? (and regarding the voice acting: male norn ftw!)
---
lulz
---
wasting time?  
---
like wasting time when going to a drink with buddys? i don't know about you and if you grind away your life in games, but i play with my friends in endgame group content and do not give a single shit about any grind.
---
It's still a grind lol.  And wow teamwork, meh...  I value personal skill much higher then shit you can get carried through.
---
Twitch.tv is the 25th most visited website in the world and it's entirely dedicated to watching others play video games.
---
I recall someone claiming to have gotten a free transfer after submitting a ticket for the same situation, but this was years ago.  If CS doesn't give you a free pass after submitting a ticket, you may have to just front the Gems to transfer again.
---
Nice try ea your loot boxes are shit, pray on young kids and ruin games. You can fuck off with your shitty boot licking
---
You may have to wait the six days anyways even if you did delete your characters for the free transfer. Otherwise you'll have to spend gems to transfer back to your old server while retaining your characters.
---
I suggest you dont do any luck related stuff for at least 1 year for I'm afraid you've used all your luck today for the next year
---
Viable in what? 
---
PvE? Yes, basically everything that makes some kind of sense works in PvE.
---
PvP? Yes, there are other skills that are much stronger than kits.
---
WvW? Yes, but you might want to use the Mortar Kit since it's very potent there.
---
Um what he stated is pretty much the consensus view on Wildstar now.
---
I never understand the logic behind this "why should I watch it when I can play it myself". 
---
Maybe the streamer is a skillful PvP player asking donations for tattoos and baby stuff? Maybe the streamer has a big c OMEGALUL mmunity with big memes and lots of raid content? Maybe the streamer casts PvP tournaments like a monkey, and you have a chance to learn something?  Maybe the streamer teaches you PvP roles with a sexy asmr voice? Maybe the stream shows you a "Waiting for TD meta" timer? Maybe the streamer smashes the table so much that you don't need to? The possibilities are endless.
---
Same as I'd be saying why would I watch football when I could play it myself, or asking why would I watch a debate when I could go debate my friend about it. But maybe the people I watch are far more better at it or have far more vast knowledge about the thing than I do. Also Twitch ain't just a platform where you watch someone doin something, you can also interact with that person and the people watching. Live chat and everything
---
Puppet and grind are just a state of mind so everything you say dosent mean shit.  Life is a grind or you can enjoy it and insist its not either way does it matter, you're still trapped in your body, have to eat food and you die.
---
Yeah that's the guide. I set up the dragon hunter dps build from metabattle since it was the closest to my current gear. I guess I should look for t2 pugs til I find a guild.
---
Don't submit multiple tickets.  It can actually slow down the response since they have to merge them.  As for cost, not sure.  Hopefully CS can help you.
---
I insult people in WvW on a monthly basis (when I go to afk farm Gift of Battle) when I say: WvW is a joke mode that the worst players in GW2 flock to. It's for people that can't successfully do hardcore PvE, nor Structured PvP.
---
I just afk after I say that and let the world burn.
---
oh, if you enjoy lootboxes, [i have the right game for you!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/889240/Loot_Box_Simulator/)  
---
if you can't see the difference between a ingame rng lootbox which you get in your free time in a game and a ingame rng lootbox (still in your free time) which you can only aquire through a currency which you get in your working time which is there to support your life then i really sorry for you.  
---
what comes ontop depending on the game is that those lootboxes are made predatory enough so you keep spending.  
---
if your life choice is to give away your money so other people can enjoy their life to the fullest then do it. i will certainly not stop you from that. BUT if i or the fun i have gets limited by such practices, i will certainly voice my concerns and will definitly vote with my wallet.
---
Wait, is the sanctuary up for sale again?
---
So true. High IQ people should also understand how to capitalize their damn words.
---
It's a build meant for raids, so it's optimizing for best DPS, so feel free to swap things around a bit to be a bit sturdier. Also apparently the focus doesn't drop DPS at all because last time I checked this, it had sword/sword + greatsword as the optimal. 
---
https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/power/
---
 Well now you're being dishonest.  There is no difference. All the lootboxes in gw2 can be bought with in game currency.

Wtf? Weird people. lol

Arenanet will probably move away from the MMO market with their next game. They have doubled down on storytelling in gw2 as their main focus the last few years and are neglecting all other modes so i wouldnt be surprised if they're going with something like a AAA adventure game next while keeping gw2 on life-support.
---
Do you have a job?

Obvious troll is obvious.

Reminds me of the time in Runescape when I changed my armour from full black armour to full rune armour. Someone reported me because I had changed my armour appearance. I guess they thought that was an offense? XD
---
Bitch what
---
That moment when I saw the title I was like 'ooo let me go look up some cool names with meanings that relate to the appearance of these new weapons'... then I look at the post and I realize Anet's already chosen the names and you're only given a few options - so in reality, you can't ACTUALLY suggest a name for these weapons :-(
---

I see the Skyscale Club is up to no good today ;) Question is, why wasn’t I invited? (Probably because I don’t have a skyscale yet.)
---
19 and 20 of what?
---
You can track them together and then reorganize them so the dalies are on top, since they'll likely be gone first. That's the best way to handle it.
---
why would you attempt to guest in the first place, that option has no purpose or effect since the megaserver system was introduced. your story makes rather little sense. while i can see support mentioning the option to delete your characters, i find it highly unlikely they'd advise you to.
---
you either transfered accidentally, in which case ANet has data on that regardless of whether it was free or not, and support is unlikely to refuse a reversal, or you're trying to get a cheap ride onto another server, potentially motivated by the relinks. in any case, this situation isn't difficult for support to figure out.
---
&gt; I didn't intend to transfer but I simply wanted to guest to one of the servers.
---
I can't help with the other things, but I can help with this. Guesting does literally nothing. Servers only exist to separate worlds for WvW, and region is the only thing that matters for playing other game modes. 
---
If you don't do WvW, and you don't have friends on a different region, there's no point to changing servers.(or guesting, but there's never a point to guesting)
---
kek?
---
If that’s actually true then it would really not be cool to make fun of them.

it’s 50/50.. either you get it or you dont

For the tower Chrono: How did you solo cap consistently with only one gs5? Do you have to pull off center? Just want to learn. Thanks!
---
Nobody is making fun of them 
---
Oh wait look a Reddit post 
---
*Grey area insues*
---
as dailies are achievements too, you can put them on your tracker just as well as any other achievement. and you even get a convenient list of them, ordered by game mode, as you first log in on a given day.

i'd rather see options to have less clutter in that area of the screen than (a rather pointless) one for more.

Open world? Berserker gear
---
* spite 1 2 2
---
* Soulreaping 1 1 2
---
* Reaper 2 1 3 ( or 1 1 3 if you like to shout)
---
GS and Axe + your favorite offhand (usually warhorn but dagger is good too with condi transfer and aoe boon corrupt+bleed)
---
On raids the build stays same but you gotta add few assassin's gears to get crit cap now that reapers mid trait is 1 instead of 3 (2% crit per vunerable stack, so 50% at 25 stacks). Or you can pick that trait and be full zerk.
---
Utility is sorta personal preference. On raids tho it's well of suffering, signet of spite, golem, shadowfiend and bloodfiend (heal minion). Some minor changes per boss can happen. See snowcrows guide for those.
---
On open world I like to run shouts due trait lowering their CD and "Suffer!" Is fun condi transfer and "you're all weaklings" does stunbreak and applies weakness.
---
If you go with bloodmagic, it's 1 3 3(or 1 non-solo to be safe) and use well healing.
---
Thankfully, judging by these downvoters, you're not alone.

Know what the funniest part about my statement is? It's true, and everyone knows it...including the ones getting hurt; which stings even more.

Have a ton of alts. Wait for your birthday gifts. =)
---
Mad? No!
---
Unorthodox!
---
Nah, I just think it’s the most neglected game mode by ANet. Most of the best players in this game (PvE and PvP) used to play WvW and stopped due to lack of updates - our last meaningful update was a mount that few core WvW players wanted. In fact, the only update for WvW that was well liked was the WvW masteries update back in 2012
---
My point was that non arenanet applications have better api crawling than their own support team it seems..
---
I mean, medically speaking there's *a lot* wrong with pugs.
---
Well...yes. And we need solutions that don’t put more animals at risk, while saving the ones who are still alive. Though...sadly, breeding dogs to be cute does work.
---
...man.
---
You can just feel the 15 year old dripping off the way he talks. 30 years old my ass.
---
I need more character slots so I can have more alts. I only have 7 lol

"our"...it's almost like you own the game mode and anybody else that has a different view of the mode is an outsider, regardless of if they play it or not.
---
May shock you, but that is not the case.

Lily of the Elon is a bit better, no eye-burning infusion stackers there.

You can see ncsofts strategy with lineage 2 earnings. They rose significantly and its attributed to new content in game. Ncsoft likely told anet hey, go make some fucking content.

This is just a pathetic attempt at validation. Scourge has its only stun break on CD, and was chasing a mirage which spammed it's disengage potential. Yes the overall duration maybe high but this is poor lack of awareness/game sense of chasing a mirage when you're on cds ( scourge counters mirage could be why he chased)

Impossible to be 100% consistent with insta cap solo tower. We needed a bit of rng for this. If u want to make it each time, u have to wait the cultist to summon a minion, kill it, grab and push.
---
Ah that makes sense. I wish I could buy the full game but can’t due to my vacation for another month or so. When I do buy the game do I buy the expansions to relieve the restrictions or is there a guild wars 2 actual game I have to buy.
---
Escrot has already been solo'ed in a non legit way or at least there has been the proof of concept that you reach the "boss" and can kill the split of McLeod with only life steal (the player did not went on to to the whole boss because killing the split that is not you color with only lifesteal takes ages :p)
---
Donations to the poor are always accepted.

You just have to have a really high IQ to understand the intricacies to this person's sense of humor.
---
Sorry I'm out of the loop with gw2 for some time now, what do we know about upcoming updates? Is there an expansion planned? Or more living world?
---
u wot m8
---
No afaik, if you buy the expansion you will automatically removed from the restrictions, considering the expansion price, if you're wondering, it's really worth the price even more (speaking price:content ratio) and i highly suggest buying both expansion to play the storyline

I met my boyfriend of 3 and a half years thanks to the game! We actually met in Latin class at university, and I saw a WoW Horde pin on his backpack. I asked him if he also played GW2, which he did, and we exchanged toon names to play together. I'm in \[SAND\] and used to, on occasion, command the Uplands event circuit. I invited him to a run so I could show off my commander tag to him. After a few months of playing together and talking on Skype (remember Skype?), we ended up getting together as a couple and we've been exploring Tyria together ever since. &lt;3
---
That person has some personal issues to work out (elsewhere). Perhaps they were just being salty about something else?
---
I always use Power Lock to interrupt cultists, and there is always one "corner" on each tower thats more favourable to push the enemies into - it takes a bit of practise to do it fairly reliable
---
He’s technically not wrong
---
Found the player who keeps dying constantly in WvW
---
I get it, black lion chests = gambling but dye kits arent? lmao..... I'm positive none of you play gw2 or games whatsoever.
---
There is also the fact that the map was hidden on every screen he capped a tower, hidding the position of Glenna
---
'I need to help uncle Jack off the the horse' and 'I need to help uncle jack off the horse' are very, very different phrases...
---
Use "u" and "cause" instead of writing the complete word...
---
Because ArenaNet never put clear UI indicators hinting at that functionality. This is just bad UX on their part.
---
Then you'd have to sacrifice one of the two wells skills that are meta in WvW. At that point you cannot compete with scourges. Or you don't take "nothing can save you", but that skill is pretty much the main selling point of picking reaper over scourge.
---
I would also recommend aiming for the Critical Strikes traitline as your first traitline from 21 - it will help increase your damage and help progress a little quicker.
---
To clarify, when you change the order of the items in the watchlist section of the achievements panel, it reorders how they appear on the achievement tracker on  the right side of your screen. I do this all the time. I keep all my achievements I'm actively (or even semi-actively) working on in the watch list and then I just move the ones I am interested in at any given moment to the top.  When I'm done, I can reorder it again. Takes a few seconds. I find it really useful.
---
Racist! Just kidding XD There seems to be a black and a white dragon, amongst the red, orange, yellow, green, blue, pink, and purple dragons. So both the black and the white ones aren't technically a part of the rainbow, but it looks rainbowy enough :P heck, the marshmallows in my supermarket have the word 'rainbow' in it, yet they're pink, yellow and green! Not rainbow at all!! :P
---
Yeah no doubt. Trying to take the high ground by sounding smart.
---
I pushed a bit randomly but i never had any capping issue after the push when there was only 5 mobs. No need to find a specific spot for me. Why using PB ? Is it in case u fail ur first gs 5 and u don’t have any previous bad spawn ?
---
It is incredibly useful. I'm amazed how I never noticed this was possible. Can't wait to try it out once I get home (in 10 hours). 
---
Your should post this as a GW2 LPT :-)
---
Was this before link? Or are you talking about the actual link right now?
---

---
/u/uwutranslator
---
Welcome to the game. More a general tip. If you don’t know if an item is worth anything or if you don’t know what it’s used for then use /wiki “item name”. For the item name most of the times you can link it to chat. That will open a browser window outside the game were you can read the wiki of the item. Game is complex especially since it’s your first MMO. So take it piece by piece and enjoy ;)
---
I've seen him too. Considering how many people *have* seen him I'm inclined to believe that his playtime is around the 18k mark and he literally does nothing but play this game, all while losing his grip on reality.
---
Also lol
---
The sad bit is that he probably is 30. He just hasn't changed for the past 15 years.
---
The fractal vendors and instant fractal access + more accessible crafting station to trading post make up for it. Sadly there is no portal to crystal desert maps , the only reason I use my lily for. Getting to PoF maps without exiting mistlock beforehand

---
owo is just wounded edges of uwu change my mind uwu  
---
Don't forget teef!
---
I am not saying making a ‘gw1 fractal’ is impossible or harf, but that the effort to create a new fractal that resembles a gw1 dungeon for gw1 players who already did that süngerin numerous times is betten spent to create a new fractal with a new setting and concept that would be exciting for everyone.
---
It is also besides the point how easy would be creating assets that resemble gw1 assets, as we both can expect that the fractal would be released at the same release schedule (once every 2 chapters) regardless of how easy it was for devs to make the assets or fractal. They kept to this release schedule rather consistently.
---
The bug with akili not being able to pass was fixed a while back.

In your case he either died or there is some new kind of bug.
---
Holy mother of Lyssa, this deserves more upvotes!
---
How have I played this game for 6yrs and just now I'm finding out you can rearrange achievements in the watch list...
---
First and foremost, get the Dragonbash achievements first.
---
check GW2efficiency with what achievements you are close to completing. Story achievements give a lot if you do them like personal story, Living world season 2, HoT, PoF and others.
---
Just wait until you hear what happens in real life.
---
Exploration + story. Just scroll through the general achieves.
---
Okok ty i will check! I’ve already finished those of dragon bash!
---
Honestly that's not the only thing. I've been accused of speedhacking from the mix of Superspeed and Executioner's Axe movement techniques because I covered a large swathe of ground in a short period of time. Funnily enough it was Plains of Ashford and I was just using it to run to the Ascalon Catacombs waypoint so the new player aspect was a given.
---
I have wished for this as well.
---
Season 1 and monthly achievements :P

\*Cries in Asura\*
---
You seem to act as if only gw1 players would get anything out of such fractals when honestly, gw2 players would likely get more since itd be a brand new experience for them, and without spending money to buy a new game.
---
As to whether the effort is more compared to something new, the effort is effectively the same. So long as it isn't done constantly I don't see an issue with one or two being geared to the theme of "experiencing gw1 stories in the new gameplay and engine".
---
Yeah very funny :D

You're got your frame rate set to unlimited. This means your system is gonna run full load to try and get as high fps as possible. Your GPU in that case is more likely to take a beating. Limit to 60fps unless you're on a 60&gt; monitor and you will balance things out more evenly. Furthermore, it's almost always bad/not worth it to not limit framerate. Power consumption (electric bill and heat output), instability and thermal throttling can occur and you speed up the natural process of electrical components degrading over time. You're also most likely running into screen tearing assuming you're not using adaptive sync, which means the game is gonna look jittery regardless of framerate. Vsync would solve that but would add input delay. You can somewhat diminish V-sync input lag by setting framerates to 58-59 to keep a 1-2 frame buffer and the screentearing will be mostly gone.  
---
The fact of the matter is, a mid range GPU from 2012 (when the game released) could max out GW2 in any scenario (minus supersampling which is a terrible form of AA). The fastest single core CPU on the market today is not gonna maintain 60fps in heavily crowded zones due to limitations in the GW2 software. A 1060 is able to push GW2 three times on 60fps with ease in terms of raw power.

Please, stop putting the burden of idiocy on minors everytime, just please. It's hurting the society as a whole, and delusionning people that no grown man can be capable of that. It's just false.
---
Comparing 1Q2019 with 1Q2018 and 4Q2018 can sometimes be inaccurate.
---
1Q2019 had "All or Nothing" + Super Adventure Box
---
4Q2018 had Halloween + Wintersday + Roller Beetle races
---
3Q2018 had "A Star to guide us" + Four Winds Festival
---
2Q2018 had "Long Live the Lich"
---
1Q2018 had "A bug in the system" + Super Adventure Box
---
4Q2017 had "Daybreak" + Halloween + Wintersday
---
Player population can go up and down and we have no idea of the evolution (A.net do however).
---
There's also the new items released in the gem store. I cannot find any timeline, but some sells better than others.
---
If players disliked the items released during a quarter but loved the items released during an other quarter, it'll have an impact on the quarter since GW2 has no subscription fee and their revenue mostly come from gem store (expansion sold after their launch is negligeable)
---
Ah so it was the exact opposite as my memory was leading me to believe; my bad!
---
But now, it's made me want to do this JP again... :P
---
Of course it's wvw.
---
I always felt wvw ranks are way too hard to get for new players yet they determine so many important things such as mount use, gliding, and pip rewards. Well I think pip rewards are the easiest to tackle to make it not so bad for new players by making rank a smaller factor in pips.
---
Perhaps using Diamond Legend with 2nd place and loyalty as a base line of 12 pips per tick, I would rather have it as 24 pips per tick with each chest doubled so it still takes the same time. So 24 pips would be 7 from rank, 2 from loyalty ( ramps up over 2 weeks), 15 from 2nd place (1st and 3rd can be 16 and 14 since no one really cares about ppt outside of fixing their next matchup)
---
That means that a new player would get 0+2+15= 17 pips from just playing for 2 weeks, or if we use the current denomination of pips, 17÷2=8.5 pips, which is way better for a new player as it is 70% of what a full rank player gets as compared to the current split of 41%. Well I feel some high ranked players maybe feel like their efforts maybe be devalued, but lets face it, farming eotm before it was nerfed shouldn't be the biggest factor  for rewards. In addition I feel the rank locked skins are decent enough as a reward and being sniped easier in a zerg is your 'prestige' factor for the high rank.
---
It is not disregarded as a notion, but as a basis from which you can draw "intelligence" conclusions. Like, measuring IQ of young students to get them the best studies is not a bad thing per se, allowing people to pursue their potential. That does not mean they're above all of us or should get special privileges though.

Let's not forget the Twitch speech - LUL OMEGALUL pog

I am on the opposite side of your world, so 8:14pm in your country is 8:14am in mine. Try setting up an anomaly kill in Timberline Falls at 8:14am in your country and see what happens.
---
True xD
---
In the domain you don't have to listen to all the dialogue flash backs. Just chase the spirit raven without stopping.
---
Jumping puzzle is one of the fastest if you haven't done all of them yet, story achievements and LW episodes can give a lot too. Also currently Dragon Bash give a good amount of AP too.
---
Just don't forget to do your daily achievements, doing 3 of them daily will give you 10AP a day.
---
I demand 1 gold from every player.
---
It's 2019, you have to use a specific number, like 200IQ or 12 billion IQ
---
There's a less known tip for leveling: killing yellow named mobs usually gives you more exp than the red named ones, because of how exp bonus works in GW2.
---
So if you have exp booster on, you can use them on unlocking WP and vistas also killing those flocks of Moa birds.
---
And I agree. Why is people downvoting my comment. I'm totally into that too! . All what I said was that we should keep supporting them. That's all. 
---
We should encourage them to change their way of doing things. I said let's keep support them. It's our part. I'm complaining regarding THEIR PART!
---
of course I don't want shitty skins I don't care, in the store. Less if it's another useless mining tool with just a choya animation!
---
We all want a Gem Store with more/better QoL and content. That I would continue buying. Happy. The rest... Season skins for weapons?... Wtf. That's bs for me
---
But people pay for them. 🙄
---
This art is by me! 
---
I drew my husbands GW2 character tonight. It took me about 3 hours to do, and I'm very happy with how it turned out. &lt;3 She's a sylvari. Enjoy!
---
Intelligence is the most overrated property of the present.
---
Just sayn.
---
-A better fking Gem Store!
---
Less shitty useless skins behind walls (available only when they want... Wtf is that!)
---
Less useless mining tools with worthless animations.
---
Less of the Miniatures...
---
-... Add more and accesible QoL assets; cheaper or affordable bank slots (at least make available a half tab that we can buy and later add the other half of the tab, so we don't have to pay full price at once), character slots packs with discount (i.E. 2 slots for 10% or 20% discount. It's a Win/win)
---
-More mini-expansions (LW Seassons are awesome in my humble opinion). Let's just add more areas content wich is connected to metas in the world so there is an actual good reason to return and not an intense farming and never to see it again.
---
-A blood DLC! I would definitely pay for that! Wouldn't change the game but live up the graphic and gore of the battles. Specially in PvE or against Wolrd Bosses.
---
-revamp the UI: better fluid Gemstore, less pressing in the Trading Post, Inventories distribution, an additional customizable skill slots for food or boosts.
---
* there is an option to lock skills at maximum range
---
* breakbar "damage" on skills would be nice when shown
---
* the full chain incl. stealth and ambush is already shown
---
Im f2p so masteries and dlcs are unavailable to me. But thank you. This was helpful. Im thinking of upgrading. But its a lot, when im so new to mmos
---
As, also, demonstrated in the video; wells are not necessary in WvW group roaming. Shouts and reaper shroud allow for more precise and consistent AoE damage. controlled direct damage &gt; scourge in certain scenarios.
---
Can I be in the debate between the content creators? No -&gt; So I watch them, if the subject is interesting for me  
---
Can I create all the Memes for myself? No -&gt; I look at other memes
---
Can I be on the sofas on Guild chat? No -&gt; I watch it, if the subject is interesting for me  
---
The question was about Gw2 and what content I consume and I don´t like watching something that I can do right know at this moment myself. I rather play it myself.
---
lol... sorry
---
Thanks so much :D
---
\^\^
---
i have a 144hz monitor and g sync. in open world i get ~100fps in a lot of areas unless im zerging ofc
---
Very nice story.
---
Stories about close friends starting out together and growing in game are always interesting to hear :)
---
Hope you found better friends since then tho
---
They better did but if they don’t announce that they are making new content then there will barely be people to play it
---
Go for it! And should it break your spirit before you reach the top, my mesmer can give you a lift. :D
---
Skype? Remember msn? :)
---
Well Anet definitely can do something about it -- it's an online game and it should be as much resistant to random disconnects as possible. One obvious thing is to keep instance locks per player: instance is not scrapped right when user disconnects, rather than it waits for, say, 15 min or an hour, for the user to reconnect.
---
Yu
---
I've only got a day to play Dragon Bash, what should I focus on doing?  
---
Any achievements I can do in a day with interesting rewards or something like that?
---
Nah, we still need PBS for break bars.
---
Make it pull instead.
---
That page is super outdated, but nothing has really changed for healers.
---
There is also an important group of GW2 players that think we have an abundance of content that returns or re-explores GW1 content, which would very much be in the dislike/indifferent if a new fractal was GW1 nostalgia and would be like/indifferent to a fractal with new setting. Even if we assume that each group has the same amount of people (which I don't think we can, considering that it is unlikely that the newer players also played gw1 simply due to how old the game is), that would put the 'liking' on both sides to a roughly equal scale. 
---
We can see people in this group, here, speaking out against the suggestion by the OP. I consider myself to be in this group, and think that by sheer exposure to the references and retreading of GW1 stuff on GW2 I have a reasonable knowledge of GW1 stuff enough to say that a new fractal that returns to a GW1 dungeon or place would not be new or exciting for me, or atleast, I wouldn't be on a neutral or indifferent ground. 
---
&gt; Thing is, it isn't "the same dungeon" really. It's only the same story; mechanics and map layout would have to be fundamentally different due to the structure of GW2's gameplay and fractals (respectively).
---
As I mentioned before, my gripe with this is that since they would essentially make new content that looks like old content, they could also make new content that is different. We have amazing stuff we can touch on that we cannot really experience outside of fractals, like when/how Gods came to Arah, planet humans came from or the planets Riftstalkers came from, older races, how Norns and Asura lived in ancient days etc., hell maybe even the future. Going instead to the same place gw1 explored to do something teeny different feels like wasted potential to me.
---
&gt;And no one, anywhere, is saying that such cannot ever occur even if some gw1 dungeons were turned into fractals.
---
I have made a comment that is relevant to this previously:
---
&gt;Yeah, I am not suggesting we have all new fractals that never revisit gw1 stuff. Its good to have bit of both.
---
However, we have to keep in mind the pace of which new fractals are released. At the moment new fractals are released once every two LS chapters, and each chapter is released once every 3-4 months, so we can expect only 1-2 fractals every year. So not only we won't see a huge number of new fractals in near future, but the time between each release is rather long. This is important because if a new fractal visits gw1, players will need to do the gw1 themed content for 6-8 until a newer fractal that explores other stuff comes. For those that do not like gw1 themed stuff or feel like we have abundance of it, this may be a too long of game time.
---
I also distinctly recall (but cannot give sources) that devs want to have 25 distinct fractals at the end so there is one of each fractal in every tier. If they intend to stop there or at least halt the release schedule temporarily, we can expect only 5 new fractals as we have 20 distinct fractals currently. While this is not too relevant to this discussion, I think the potentially small number of newer fractals is related to the variety of content we would get there. Even 2 gw1 themed fractals would affect the variety significantly.
---
What does gender have to do with this
---
Actually the dye packs were from black lion chests.
---
Send him some salt (the item)
---
Ye and sAbIR for air
---
-Tracking of achievements in a separately manner. I. E. Daily achievements and Story,/region/area/hero/collectibles.
---
You took the tower cap strategy from me.. some credits would be nice
---
&gt;So that argument is imo complete bull.
---
I was considering the gw1 retreading in general gw2 rather than fractals only, and even when fractal alone is considered I would not find a gw1 themed fractal interesting. So we can agree to disagree there. 
---
&gt;I've seen a dev comment that they've not given consideration to a max of unique fractals but are willing to make more than 25 unique fractals. Counter to your thought.
---
To this I said:
---
&gt;At the very least we could expect some additional work as they come up with a way to handle 25+ fractals each tier. This may result in some delays in the new fractal releases too.
---
So it is very likely that 5 fractals may be what we get in the foreseeable future until they find a way to change fractals to accommodate more. Anet hasn't always been super fast in potentially major or structural changes so I am guessing there will be significant delay.
---
nope, would require too much coding.
---
Guard is an excellent choice. 
---
Use Zeal 323, Radiance 333 and Dragonhunter 123.
---
Skills: litany of wrath, save yourself, stand your ground, procession of blades, feel my wrath.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy
---
**Gambler's fallacy**
---
The gambler's fallacy, also known as the Monte Carlo fallacy or the fallacy of the maturity of chances, is the mistaken belief that, if something happens more frequently than normal during a given period, it will happen less frequently in the future (or vice versa). In situations where the outcome being observed is truly random and consists of independent trials of a random process, this belief is false. The fallacy can arise in many situations, but is most strongly associated with gambling, where it is common among players.
---
The term "Monte Carlo fallacy" originates from the best known example of the phenomenon, which occurred in the Monte Carlo Casino in 1913.

First of all, the serious advice:
---
GW2 isn't a game about facetanking enemies by having a lot of armour or a really big health bar. There's a big emphasis on movement, dodging and using abilities to block attacks rather than passively relying on numbers. Prioritise your damage output, defensive stats are a waste if you never get hit. 
---
And then the other advice:
---
Grab two pistols, press 3. Have fun.
---
What's home instance?
---
I hope you replied to his magnum opus with 'lol'.
---
I will definitely get better at movement and ability dodges for your serious advice and your fun advice intrigued me...I’ll try it next time I play
---
Tengu.

Any improvements for dx12pxy on medium to low pc setups?

Y typ mNE letR wen ltl do
---
Turkey.
---
Nope , she kinda failed to come back :D.
---
Ah looks like I’ll have to get a good bow then. I have an old one that I near used because I thought the damage on aoe attacks was bad
---
As a German that looks fine for me. 
---
/s
---
or we could you know have dungeons again and use them for world building instead of 1 off content that's detached from so much, or reused assets from living worlds.
---
After a break of a few months, jumped back into fractals last night as a Druid and got (gently) criticised by one of the people I played with, and perhaps rightfully so. I'm wearing full asc Harrier's and have updated the build the small amount since I last played. I know that it's harder to judge my performance than DPS classes, but is there a boon uptime % or healing benchmark I should be aiming for? I'm guessing these numbers would be heavily dependant on my party stacking?
---
tl;dr where I do I try to improve as Druid in fractals
---
No, it's 100% chance because it's already happened.
---
this is how they deal with this problem in Chinese client. https://i.imgur.com/XKEUJyl.jpg
---
If they add a living world daily panel, that will be much better.
---
Careful now, u dont wanna grief others.
---
Not really how technically works but whatever, people seem to agree with you.
---
Huh
---
Psuedointellectuals do
---
Old habits die hard I guess.
---
Exactly! :D
---
I heard a while ago that people were having issues with buying from other sites and that some people even got their account lost/banned in the process. This site is safe? 14$ for is a steal.
---
You can buy them only through the gem store! There was a time you could get Season 4 for free before episode 6 came out (when they had the recap or something) and there is a post on reddit two months ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bkl2w0/living_world_season_2_is_on_sale_44/) that said Season 2 was on sale.
---
though 2 bucks for an episode is very cheap, even for the full price.
---
Ah thanks my guy!
---
Then you can also get Armistice bastion. Ye, it has interfaces with WvW, but offers absolutely gorgeous map and usually is populated just decently.
---
I once soloed one path of Sorrows Embrace. It took me an insane amount of time.
---
I was using a Viper Scourge, with the blood magic traitline for more survival.
---
even the mastery update wasn't very well received. as so many things back then, wvw ranks were still character bound, effectively locking you into one class. the update was also hyped by collin as a super huge one, when in fact it had almost no impact on the gameplay with one exception: guard stacks that were so utterly OP that everyone was virtually forced to unlock them before anything else.
---
Usually around 15-20 minutes.
---
Asshole wandered in from WoW, is my guess.
---
I was half way to agreeing. Then read everything after.
---
Saying lol sometimes is mindless, but it's still something.
---
Upvoted this hard, this has irritated me for years.
---
&gt; ...he could mean "Our" as in the entire player base of GW2.
---
Exactly who are you trying to fool? Yourself?
---
...I wonder...
---
that only ever happens to people buying from shady resellers that often get their hands on keys through credit card fraud. these however are official resellers and they are trustworthy.
---
VISA is just a "messenger" to your bank. VISA can make the payment through, that locks amount from your account to be paid, but then when bank actually goes to process it, they could have some automated system to flag it and the whole payment is stopped.
---
It is pretty much common problem, and usually easily solved.
---
Why would I want to buy another pass?
---
The amounts of people would be absolutely big, in high thousands, that means huuuge network issue. Also it would be just messy and probably filled by advertisers/spammers. Also, per-world chat does not really make sense with megaservers (aka whole EU together)
---
If you want such chat with people at such hours, probably easiest is to try open squad in LFG. That way you can chat in sqaud chat across maps, while everyone is doing whatever they want. But if many will connect is different question. There is usually mentor parties in LFG for new players to ask questions, and maybe some RP people, but otherwise hard to say until you try it out.
---
Or just try to get in touch with people you encounter, join their guilds, or make new one...there is a reason why you can be in 5 guilds at once.
---
go into wvw and take a good hard look at team chat and what it got swiftly twisted into (imo that is in large part due to it only being made functional after anet already severely offending the driving away the dedicated veterans and communities that encouraged some semblance of order, but that is another topic, and OW content lacks a substantial equivalent for its size). neither you nor anet want a server chat. such a chat offers little but a sublime stage for idiots and trolls to spew their nonsense into a (in many cases way too well receiving) audience.
---
a case could however be made for a megaserver chat - which in my interpretation would be a unified chat for different shards of the same map, though i would exclude *at least* cities and hubs from that 🤔
---
How long have you been on the internet? :)  I've yet to encounter a global chat channel in an MMO that wasn't a toxic brain-cancer inducing hangout for the terminally trollish.  At least in map-chat ppl tend to talk about things going on in the map.  If you remove that hook what do you think the loudest people will talk about?  Politics, racism, your mom, and other wholesome topics.
---
Have you considered looking outside your timezone if finding an active guild is an issue?
---
raids get pretty goddamn boring after a while so they aren't missing out on much
---
&gt;Don't get hung up on one very particular use of a word that doesn't really define the rest of the argument.
---
Again, zoom the point goes right over your head.
---
Master level troll. Got you to post to social media. 🥇
---
Idk, the last time I was to wvw we were discussing whether muslims should be allowed in EU, I had the least extremist opinion, for once XD
---
A little temp ban would make these people think twice about going on ego tripping tirades and insults in chat.
---
Mystic salvage kits if you don't have the infinite one, otherwise I would gamble for precursors with cheap exotics.
---
Already got the infinite one.

direct buy or order?
---
Nuuvem it's 200% safe.
---
They are projecting their behaviour onto others to avoid feeling bad about themselves whilst being abusive douches. These people with a little bit of power as commander or raid leader lets their angst run wild against anyone willing to talk back to them.
---
it's listed in Brazil
---
You mean 13 living world daily panels. 'cause that's how many of them categories we have today. :(
---
What are music box drops and how do they work?
---
Also, "each map", would that be i.e the Desolation and then Kourn or something?
---
Good job! Reminds me of Lee Moyer’s art from the 13th Age RPG.
---
Ty sir
---
Gw2 got around 300 players online. Others are just bots
---
Music box is just a gizmo ( rare drop hence the price) :P if you're in EU I can show you one. Also the maps are the PoF maps ,i.e, crystal oasis, Elon riverlands, Domain of Vabbi and the Desolation ( desert Highlands does not award any gemstone ). Kourna is a living world season 4 map. The 4 pof maps I mentioned has metas which award the daily regional chest. If you have HoT, each of the 4 maps have metas which award a chest as well which give gemstones.
---
Isn't that achievement awarded immediately after you do so, though?
---
I've noticed the few people that do talk like this in mapchat and full groups are always the same egotistical trolls. Whilst almost everyone  ignores their spam, there are always a few who take the bait and get stuck in flame wars with these types of egoists who just want an argument and seem to be triggered by anything that doesn't agree with them. You can see it in most MMOs but it's especially apparent in pub raids and elitist guilds who think they are Gods gift to gaming.
---
I'm sure Anet had metrics on everything seeing what difference it made to keep people around, and I'm guessing it wasn't that big of a deal if they didn't bring them back.
---
But personally, it just seems like it would be something that would keep people grinding out stuff for at least the first half of the month. Give people rewards for just logging in, playing a bit every day, but also playing every month. I think maybe even yearlies might even be good for that as well, but perhaps the rewards would need to be too good to convince enough people to do them.
---
I would be for their return though.
---
I like the Idea of yearlies:)
---
One yearly I would want to see is "Run every Fractal...twice" and "Run 800 T4 Fractals":D
---
unlikely but not impossible because rng is rng.

1. Join a dueling room on the PvP game browser.
---
 2. Find a build on metabattle.
---
The ustistic comments maybe are a bit wrong. It is just how I sort of think about chasing achievements and collections. I remember a game called cookie clicker. I can't remember how exactly it worked, but I sort of remember it went along the lines of pressing a button and the score increasing. It seemed to me people who enjoyed it for any length of time may be on the spectrum. 
---
I was going to disagree with your comments, but I think in general you are actually right. Technically what you said is content, but not content I would ever consider doing for fun. It is the content that I find fun that is voer in a couple of hours, technically there is deffinitely more content there.
---
Also I think you are right about in the GW2 themepark  devs aren't going to be able to keep up with content, even for a lot of casual players. Thinking back to games I have played over long periods of time, they was more gear grind orientated. I mean in ANarchy Online I never actually fully geared a charracter in ten years of having a sub. It is obviously very different in GW2.
---
I just had a sort of epiphany moment responding to you where I realsied that most of the game feels very stale to me. Maybe I need a break and to come back if there is an expansion. I hav eall story done, and like 8k pvp matches played. I have got plenty of play time vs money spent. I am probably whinging too much, as I imagine there is plenty of people who enjoy the content I don't.
---
They do have annual achievement if I am not mistaken
---
People say bad things about every single MMORPG out there. Even the most popular MMO of all time. If an MMO isn't dying, it's buggy, it's pay to win, it's got a content draught, it's unbalanced. The problem isn't the game. The problem is that you're letting other people tell you what you should like. 
---
I agree certain areas of the game should be more cared for, however, I've played quite a few MMOs and I've never found an MMO that I prefer to this one. Not even close. 
---
Saying that the game is a waste of potential is silly, when we don't know how successful it would have been if it fulfilled it's potential for any specific group of players. Maybe it would be more successful...maybe it would be less. Either way, who the fuck cares what some people say about it. Anyone who laughs at something I like isn't worth my time anyway.  Shrugs.

&gt;particular world

All worlds merged into megaserver, except WvW.
---
&gt;certain guild
---
/r/GuildRecruitment
---
If you use a timer site, like gw2timer.com or the wiki events timer page, you'll find out where and when groups of people are. There's always people at the HoT metas, the PoF metas (these days anyway), the new festival, Tequatl.   
---
Learn to use a timer site and the LFG tool and find yourself a decent guild. I play with people 90% of the time I'm in game, and I play every single day.
---
I'd prefer they lump historical in with the cap and increase it so that we can have a level playing field for achievement points.
---
Interesting idea.  I think it would be a troll's dream and so toxic most of the time, but it would certainly allow for chat on some of those Tyrian maps that seem deserted most of the time.
---
I agree, if they just brought back the same format of monthlies we had before it wouldn't work. They weren't a good incentive for people who didn't play much, and people who did, could finish them in a few hours of one day. I think if reworked, they could offer some fun goals to take on over the course of a month with a few rewards for doing so.
---
Worlds only mean something for World vs World. The game moved to a mega Server system a while ago which means that you play on instances of maps with everyone from your Region.
---
It can happen that you are put on a new instance that is created because the others reached the thresholds which could make it look empty.
---
r/guildrecruitment/ is the place to look for guilds.
---
How about this:
---
Increase the cap but have the limit be equal to the previous daily + monthly cap but add living story/world 1 to it. Most players have absolutely no chance of competing in AP because of season 1 and it seems like it would level the playing field without having to actually add anything else.
---
"another [insert game here] is dying because [insert game devs here] are a bunch of big dumb dumbs"-thread.
---
"Huge waste of potential" sums up pretty nicely.
---
How many times will you post this same type of thread
---
&lt;3
---
Bacon walking
---
Yeah I remember doing them quickly on patch days, hoping something would bug out and you'd get double the AP
---
All good points but OP is just strawmanning to try and justify their opinion
---
For casual fractal runs Chrono + Druid is still fine but you can have either a smoother run or a faster run with FB +Ren (applicable to "bosses" fractals with limited amount of skips or groups where people have portals all over the place). FB + Ren also help have smoother boon uptime: missing a well is very bad but missing 1 quickness proc from a FB mantra is not that bad because the stack/CD is shorter.
---
For Raids Druid is still going strong even if you usually don't take more than 1 per group (the 2nd Druid usually does not provide much compared to adding almost any other healer).
---
I completely agree.
---
Until something changes I use an android app to track long term achievements, so I can have my watchlist empty and therefore able to see the dailies. It is far from ideal, but I thought I should share in case someone finds that useful.
---
Should also include AP from festivals &amp; retired achievements.
---
I have a "gaming" laptop with a 1060 maxq and dx12pxy completely removed the stuttering issues i had! It didnt improve the FPS significantly but it feels a LOT smoother now that it doesnt stutter.
---
When did :DDD become a classic ._.
---
I may have become an old.
---
No, its 200% chance because it's already happened twice.
---
So, if I understand you correctly that this would mean that those players who didn't play the game while season 1 was available they should be able to get those AP while those who did play it are not able to get those AP?
---
&gt; have absolutely no chance of competing in AP because of season 1
---
This is absolutely not true. Season 1 "only" gives around 2500 AP total. That isn't really much and you can still compete in AP.
---
However, SHOULD YOU be able to compete in AP with someone who played the game for 7 years and with every content while you (general you) only played for a year? I hope not because staying with the game would be meaningless with that sort of thinking.
---
I'm okay with a cap increase because everyone is then able to increase their cap but I think it is a very bad sign to single out your yearlong loyal playerbase by making it easier to get to the same level for everyone else.
---
What this is an actual sub?!
---
Not every core class works well in PvP. Kind of a shame, because I would love to see core classes be just as capable so everyone has more options, but it's just how things are.
---
Remember, GW2 isn't trying to be a F2P game. It's meant to be played with the expansions, and I'd argue it's worth it for more than just elite specs.
---
That being said, if you are just looking to play PvP and don't care about them, there are core classes that work better in PvP. Thief's top build is core. Warrior and Guardian also have competent builds in PvP. I think Necro has something that's okay, but could be wrong.
---
What App do you use?

Sockpuppet account of /u/90Art90 which is obviously a troll account

Thank you for your time
---
Glad you got out
---
In that case I agree, and wells are actually bad in smallscale fights. But I wasn't aware that there are people still roaming nowadays, given that there's no point in it (personal rewards wise).
---
From someone who was there at launch, lost interest till the expansions, recently picked it back up, and recently lost interest again - here is my take.
---
**Too many fucking systems**
---
I was doing fractals, needed agony resist, purchased a few items with laurels, was told by other players how dumb I goofed because apparently it wasn't the most efficient means, but more importantly it was just convoluted feeling.
---
It's not fun to feel like you're playing wrong. With so many systems going, it's easy to feel that way.
---
and easier. spending 30 minutes by completing three daily achievements is something different than getting "Six Minutes to Knightfall" in season 1. Significantly easier.
---
Weeklies that make people map complete/dungeon clear for gemstore stuff, like maybe a key?
---
What is harassment, you say?
---
It's what I want it to be, you toxic asshat bigot.
---
Especially when everyone just grinded them in a day
---
&gt;A general tip for life. Never let how others feel about something determine how you should feel. If they're detractors then they probably already don't play the game and aren't up to date with the content here.
---
IDK, I think it might be a little odd in the case of GW2, some of the community here acts pretty schzophrenic, I have some friends (and I do still consider them friends) who spend so much time complaining about the game in a very similar fashion to OP, they will be on the official forums for hours bawling their eyes out, opening tickets with [a.net](https://a.net), writing online petitions (LOL) etc etc. They seem totally miserable but when you see their outfits and look at their AP/mastery scores it's obvious they live in this game. 
---
Meanwhile scrub casuals like me with barely 7k AP and 100-ish mastery spend 90% of my gaming time playing something else (mostly consoles), we hardly ever post in forums (this is my first time writing in this sub... this year? IDK), if something happens in GW2 that annoys me, like getting whacked by some Thief in the centre of SMC 10 seconds before the lord goes down, I just go play console games for a couple days and come back and all my GW2 saltiness is gone. 
---
TL;DR I think the most vocal GW2 detractors are actually hardcores who have run out of stuff to do
---
Oh God help the person who picked up that stone near the troll cave in Queens dale
---
My friend played gw2 before me, probably a solid few years before me. He didn’t get too far, not max level that’s for sure but he has “looked down” on me for admitting i love gw2. He called it just a wow copy and I really couldn’t argue back. All I said it’s probably more casual than wow and he would like it since he doesn’t care about gaming as much as he did when we were kids. But the older and older we get the more and more considering and friendly we get (not on the internet tho, here i can let out my inner asshole) and he too. Now he was kinda interested, not in gw2 itself but like ‘heck man what have you been up to? you say you still play gw2 and you really seem to enjoy it’. Point is people grow older and in a way wiser. The people you talk about that look down on you just for playing gw2 are either not interested whatever you say or are just in a bad place/bad mood. Second point is, never be ashamed of what you love, never. People will respect you far more if you’re honest with them and more importanly for you, if you’re honest with yourself. Gw2 is good. It’s damn good. I hate the MTX. I wish we lived in a world where such things were not a thing but I don’t have a solution either, other than becomming a billionaire and buying anet itself. If i was a billionaire I would buy anet and honestly I would not care if it would cost me more than it would being it. But that’s just me. I hate that that we’re not getting enough content especially the neglected PvP and WvW scene even though I really only play PvE. I hate those things because i love the game and I know I’m far from being the only one and I want everyone- the casuals, the eliteists, the MLG pro quickscoping PvP players- to be happy. And you know what? I’m sure most of anets devs feel the same. I really do think they feel that way. Who else would make skyscale acquisition easier just because there is one person out there who has some illness and can’t react fast enough. Only a good caring person would.
---
ohh boy though...see you in some other post where i go total apeshit again.
---
If you end up getting heart of thorns then thief becomes the god of dodging with the daredevil elite spec. It's a subclass entirely based on bouncing around like a rabbit on crack and smacking people with a staff.
---
While path of fire will instead take you down the Deadeye route, the importance of dodging and evasion still can't be understated. You don't do any damage when you're dead after all.
---
When you add LS4 maps in, then yeah, there's going to be overlap.  But there's so much game that there's always going to be overlap somewhere.  Both of those metas also overlap with Shadow Behemoth, and you might not finish Palawadan in time to do whatever comes at :00 afterwards, too.
---
Because Palawadan is tied to the day/night cycle, there's nothing else that can be done with it.  It starts at nightfall, just like Verdant Brink does.
---
If only it hinted at just those of the incel type
---
Well, Anet did add a sink to convert excess luck into gold:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aip91d/drooburts_ghost_is_frozen_in_ice_and_asking_for/
---
The issue is the excessive amount of clicking.  But as far as price goes, it looks like the comments put it at a little over 1 silver for 1 exotic luck.
---
&gt; Monthlies are dailies with bigger numbers.
---
Well yes, but actually no. I might not have time or want to play dungeons or JPs *today*, but will want some day during the month, and now there's an option. They are more flexible *even if* some will choose to rush them.
---
&gt; I'd rather see something fresh and different and new.
---
Real content takes way more time to develop; adding monthlies would take a fraction of the time for significant boost of engagement for those who want an extra reason to play already.
---
I agree, they would definitely need to be revamped to work.
---
bad placement? If any it's the contrary, events like Junundu -&gt; Augury Rock/Doppleganger -&gt; Pinata are placed so you can jump from one to another as soon as one ends. And then after Pinata you can do another round of Junundu and from that point chain to Serpent's Ire that starts at the same time but that will be still going on when Junundu ends. And after Serpent's Ire you can do the doggiess if you want.
---
Where's maw? Well, i just do it when there's nothing else and it's up. I prefer junundu because it doesn't bug and rolls double for elegy mosaics (besides it has a chance for the junundu mini).
---
ANd buried treasures, well, that's not an event really. I got bored quite fast.

I tried that, got some gold, but i broke my mouse, literally.. hope next year we'll get a better vendor

Use:

ingame to see boss stuff
---
I would order or use what I get from drops.
---
How about weekly Dungeon achievements in hard mode. You give incentive for players to return to Dungeons and challenge the hardest difficulties so they all get best drops (make Dungeons drops great again) plus the achievement reward (rare mats, laurels, AP points. Etc.)
---
That would require Anet to actually plan out the ultra high AP achievement awards.  Currently Anet hasn't figured out what to put at 45,000 ap, etc
---
250 days, so not even a year.

Diviner
---
50% more health for your minions so they can tank longer and some extra Toughness for you for each one. 25% more damage and condition transfer. A cheat death proc that works with Desert Shroud and Harbinger Shroud. 
---
It's for survival, not edging out even more damage when you already deal more than enough to kill anything. You, like the other person, need to learn to think outside that tiny little "DO MORE DAMAGE AT THE COST OF EVERYTHING ELSE. EVERYTHING THAT ISN'T DOING MORE DAMAGE IS SHIT!" box you're trapped inside because of raiding.

Whilst I don't recall having said "Everything is viable in open world builds" in my previous reply, I do agree with the sentiment. A full minstrel firebrand with rune of the sanctuary (or whatever the uber tank rune is nowadays) is completely viable for open world, you're just going to have a Very Bad Time actually managing to kill things. It's not that you won't, you're just going to be there for *quite* some time. As a result, I wouldn't dream of recommending such a build to someone because whilst it's viable, it's not useful due to the complete overkill on sustain. 
---
The same applies to dear old death magic. I wouldn't recommend it to someone because, not only will you have enough sustain through BM, it's just *bad* and it doesn't bring anything to the table. For context, the last time I used death magic was over a year or two ago to solo Mai Trin on condi reaper, back when she was still the highest fractal tier, and even then it was just to abuse the not-yet-nerfed "Rise" minions. That was a very niche encounter and since "Rise" was changed, there went the one reason to use the traitline. 
---
Like I said, if you really do want to, go ahead and use death magic, play the game in a way that you enjoy. However, please don't misinform players and tell them they "SHOULD" be running bm + dm for open world, because that really is objectively incorrect.
---
Try blackgate
---
**TLDR:** Ultimately it would bring bad publicity to the image of our otherwise atypically helpful community :(
---
I miss Age of Conan's global chat channel, it really was a sight to behold sometimes.  With that said, having a global/server channel would produce some ugly and very public effects.  
---
Anet would be forced to act on players being abusive or otherwise malicious because transgressions in this chat would be visible to potentially huge numbers of players.  That last bit itself would be a huge draw to trolls, gold spammers and other problem causers.  Currently, a problematic player in chat can affect at most ~150 other players in a given instance;  That's a drop in the bucket compared to the whole game or server's population.  
---
Anet as a company is known for being or allowing moderators who work with their stuff to be extremely heavy handed on censorship.  A global chat system with this level of knee-jerk censorship would not be able to fly very long because they'd end up having to block so many people out of these channels for a multitude of reasons.. Not the least of which has to do with what is considered acceptable in a public chat in a given region of the world;  It's actually not the same everywhere.  Also the topics would absolutely get steered towards topics that are known to stir passion and anger in people;  A "master baiter" (lul) needs only say 1 line to start a single topic arguement that can carry on for several days (Seen it).  
---
Individual players would have to take responsibility to manage their own emotions (God forbid...) and do things like reporting and blocking the problematic player.  I've had way too many conversations with people who just can't bring themselves to do it for whatever reason... You had exactly ONE job there.  This one actually does piss me off because no company or even government can save people who won't stop being a victim... When they do, it leads to the kind of censorshit mentioned above.  
---
This is what I consider to be the root of why we can't have nice things like a global/server chat in GW2.
---
Thanks. I'm scared to use dx12pxy because I don't wanna wake up and randomly get banned one day but maybe I'll check t out
---
A solid choice.
---
I mostly want them to cap the AP for dailies and monthlies separately so they show up as even numbers on my AP screen. The weird split I have now makes me . . . anxious.

Diversion: Strikes up to five targets within range 
---
Does this trait apply increased CC based on the number of illusions on all targets? In other words: could this be used to CC the 3 mortar adds on Trio by simply using sword 3 -&gt; diversion?
---
It's called choices. Do you want want Loot/Gold or Serpentites? Do you prefer all the Awakened/Dervishes/Paragons or Branded/Riftstalkers? Laying siege on the Corsairs or being sieged for  Charging Crystals?
---
Well if you got no expansion, it will be rough for you m8.

I use it all the time along with Dune quotes.

It is, if only that is axejaw LUL.

What is gw2 radar? Sorry I dont use addons and dont know what this does.
---
Says they are harassing them through the map chat by harassing them with a mail ....
---
he pulled a Banksy, now you see it, now you're not.
---
Well, Anet did make GW2 happen, which is far far more than what the 'waste of potential' crowd ever did.
---
So these beautiful, very competent persons should get ahold of themselves, stop being lazy and quit wasting the potential of their own game and make it happen already. We are waiting.
---
Don't want to trust Anet? Good. Trust yourself and do better! You know you can.
---
Yeah but sounds like OP won't have Reaper, only Necro and Scourge.
---
Mo ltr mo prblm
---
I don't know who you are supposed to be, but this way of capping is very obvious and has probably been found independently by many people. It's been used for a long, long time as well, so long that it would be ridiculous to credit someone even if there was a single popular video etc. that sparked it.
---
Best art post today, cant see anything wrong with it.
---
MightyTeapot has released an excellent guide for Adina on youtube.
---
While I'd say that you *do* want to eventually become level 80, I'd strongly suggest against any power-leveling/speed-leveling methods. If you do decide to buy the expansions (yes, I'd *highly* recommend them!), don't use the level-80 booster. You wanna learn the game by leveling first.
---
I just want them back because I hate seeing the Monthly AP number not maxed out and never will be maxed out.
---
Oh I know.... yearlies!
---
Do you really need to bring your personal drama excerpts to forums
---
GW2 is a very big game, with a wide range of gamemodes and complex mechanics. So just getting to the point of "the streamer cant tell me anything new about the game" takes you months and months of watching.
---
After that you keep watching because the streamer is entertaining, organizes events or discusses the game with the viewers or other streamers.
---
Twitch is a healthy mix of educational and entertaining TV, with the added bonus of interaction between viewers and streamer.
---
I dont mind, but if they still count for the 15k AP cap i probably wont do them much.
---
I dug out my eyes, nothing near that size. I'll pick some up at the hobby store. I must have one of these. Thanks again for posting the pattern.
---
It's not about opinion. It is about being less relevant to the game it's in. The Mystic Forge is an often used part of the GW2 world known to basically every player. Bastion of the Penitent is relevant to people who know a specific GW1 character who was thought to be dead.
---
Wow, that was educational.
---
It's guaranteed if you don't get something else
---
Actually I don't believe we will kill another dragon. We just killed Kralkatorrik because 1 we had someone to take his power and 2 he was getting really dangerous and if we didn't kill him Tyria and the mists would be destroyed. If these 2 things hadn't happened we would have stuck to our original plan in protecting the Elder Dragon.
---
No
---
but GW1 allows you to reconnect ...
---
yeah thats true. i guess i didnt bother too much because there was nothing of much value on that acc. but i guess i could try :)
---
i'm going for A and C
---
What a riveting story. Thanks for sharing!
---
ooooh gotta save this! &lt;3
---
I want it all! I want it all! I WANT IT ALL! AND I WANT IT NOOOOW :3
---
Love love love this so much! 
---
Do you have a page on which I can follow your work? &lt;3
---
There really are a bunch of idiots working in management at ArenaNet. The only fix would be to fire them, which will never happen.
---
I just recently came back to GW2 after six year hiatus and am playing on my ancient PC with Sandy Bridge i5 at like 3 ghz and a GeForce 590. I’m playing the base game on medium settings right now at about 30-45 FPS. Are the expansions add any resource demands to the game? Would I be able to play the game with the expansions and get the same performance?
---
It *is* about your opinion atm.
---
Another +1%xp gain increase, 2g and 2 laurels obviously.
---
I'm aware of that. Which is why I want them back. So I can have a nice round number.
---
Dragon's Stand not included because it's long af:
---
* 00:00 Elon Riverlands - **Doppelganger**    
---
* 00:04 Domain of Vabbi - **Forged with Fire**    
---
* 00:09 Verdant Brink - **Wyvern Matriarch** (this one needs a character parked at the spawn platform)    
---
* 00:12 Crystal Oasis - **Choya Pinata**  
---
* 00:25 Tangled Depths - **Chak Gerent**  
---
* 01:00 Auric Basin - **Tarir Meta**   
---
* 01:30 The Desolation - **Junundu Rising**   
---
* 01:45 Done  
---
You should also consider doing the Leyline Anomaly as it rewards a Mystic Coin, and I believe those are around 1g50s each right now. And it's significantly less effort than most of these.
---
It is already possible to get more coins per month than back when monthlies were still around ...
---
One of the last monthlies I completed within 1 hour after reset :D
---
And double the rewards :P
---
I think they lowered the population threshold for a server to become "full".  It's very noticeable in NA as well.  I was on a server that was full for months where the only queue we would ever get is one map on reset night.
---
not really, it was one more of those things u rush tru in a day or 2 max, and forget about
---
Doesnt the amulet and other ring have the same stats combo? :P If you knew them you could choose the same for the two unknown to you :D
---
So I'm doing PvP for legendary armor. I was told the mantra bunker build on Metabattle doesn't do well in random fights / solo q (like I'm most likely to be doing), so I'm playing blood sage scourge / that annoying mirage build instead.
---
Is Firebrand really that bad by itself? Also are there any builds that can win a match by itself in solo q and/or the very low ranks (since I still need to get my pvp rank to 20 to start actually working on the armor)? I'm able to play/learn every class and I enjoy just about every profession.
---
Dragon's Stand can take 30 to 60 min so it's hard to pin point when it's best to hop in.
---
Someone stole the plantforce of power. Only courage and wisdom remain :p
---
That spot is filled if you have everything, but I forget with what
---
Yeah, i remember before Hot came out i always entered it one of the Hot events and always managed to catch the towers ending, but I cant for the life of me remember which
---
&gt; personal rewards wise
---
As someone who spent a huge time roaming while actively playing, I have never did it for rewards nor remember any time it was good anyway. Also, people who actively roamed did it for fights and fun either. Who the hell even roams for rewards?
---
Really often, actually!
---
Apologies for incoming wall of text
---
There are some things the game just never explains to new players. The biggest, worst offender has to be [cc bars](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Defiance_Bar). For your own sake and that of everyone around you, please take the time to read that page. When you see people calling for cc, this is what they mean. When an encounter seems like it's too hard, there's a pretty good chance it's because you're not breaking that bar at the right time... or at all. Learn what skills you have that do cc, and always keep a few ready.
---
If anyone ever says anything in chat that you don't understand the meaning of, ask. Most of the time people are happy to explain.
---
You can ping items, waypoints, and POIs in chat by either ctrl-clicking on it (instantly pings in chat) or by shift-clicking on it (adds the ping to your chat bar at the cursor's current position so you can type around it and put multiple pings in one message).
---
Make liberal use of "/wiki" to pull up the game wiki. Even better, you can use "/wiki Grenth" to instantly search the wiki for "Grenth" and go to the most relevant page. EVEN BETTER, you can use "/wiki [ping goes here]" to instantly go to the page for whatever thing you pinged. This is exceptionally useful when you're starting out, as you're going to be getting a lot of items that you have no idea about - any time you don't know what it is, use this command!
---
This game is all about movement and positioning. Learn your hitbox, learn when to dodge vs. when to just walk out of an attack, learn to watch the tells, and learn what those tells mean. The core game is notoriously easy, so if you haven't learned to position properly by the time you get into expansion or endgame content you're going to have a bad time.
---
Don't worry about your gear too much as you level to 80. Levelling happens so quickly in this game that you'll outgrow your equipment before it was ever really worth fussing over. If you're struggling with something before level 80, it's almost never about your gear. Try a new strategy instead. 
---
That said, when you get the choice of what gear you want before 80, I recommend focusing on power damage. That means power, precision, and ferocity - in that order. You don't have to stick with that forever, but for the levelling process that combination is good. Avoid putting stats into survivability (toughness, vitality), as being tanky when you're learning the game will teach you bad habits. Even extremely tanky endgame builds require you to know how not to take damage in the first place.
---
Lastly, there are players that sometimes just sit in early maps with mentor tags to help out new players. If you see these players, they're usually the best people to ask questions. Also, I'm one of them. If you PM me your account or character name, I'll send you a package of stuff to help you get started.

this isn't true with current balance.

No, it still is.

Safe bets are scourge if you pair it up with a support, soulbeast, holosmith and spellbreaker.

Herald right now is probably the top pick though.

Hello! :) Thank you so much for the lovely words! ;o;
---
You can follow me on my Instagram: brittneykay21. Anywhere else I post, I also post there as well. :)
---
but it's not. Not saying mirage is bad, just saying it isn't a "monster" anymore.
---
Because it isn't.
---
Aw, thank you! :)
---
Thank you!! :)
---
Ahhh! Thank you so much! ;o; I really appreciate it!
---
With tons of community event we get lately. Im pretty much cant keep track of monthly if it brought bsck.
---
For PoF, every class except renegade (revenant), has a top tier build- so play what you’re comfortable with and practice. There are pvp builds on metabattle that you can use and then tweak as you see fit once you understand how your class works.
---
Your  girlfriend is a lady of fine taste :O
---
Aw, thank you so much! ;o;
---
That’s stunning!
---
Love the colors, is your girlfriend predicting an upcoming Cantha expansion by any chance?
---
Could you link to their statement on this? I'm pretty sure I'm developing carpal tunnel
---
lol k

can i see wvw dailies in armistice bastion instead of pve ones? ty
---
I quit playing because of this. When laurels were new and valuable it was extremely frustrating that some players could just get double and anet just continued to allow the exploit to exist
---
Can we finally just have a way to make the word vomit in the top right just fuck off entirely?
---
As others have stated. Get shards for fighting bosses (more for kills) with a weekly cap. Random ascended drops (any trash drops can be salvaged for shards that DO NOT count to the weekly cap) and doing the raid legendary armour achieve will get you a full set of armour.
---
Thanks!
---
Could you post the rank you are atm? Your other comments on this post are showing that you don't really PvP/ no understanding of any form of semi-high tier PvP and also are pretty childish. Loads of people have already pointed out here that maybe chasing a mirage as scourge on cds is not in his/her best interest but you seem adamant on blaming it on class and not skill.
---
Core2Quadim
---
There is a substantial difference between a 30 day window and 24 hour window, even if the total goal is bigger for the first. Monthlies are much more managable for people who can only play for blocks of time on certain days.
---
Dailies feel like a chore pressuring you to log in.
---
I don't think ArenaNet will bring monthlies back because they want the pressure to log in each day. They probably think dailies keep the population active each day, while monthlies would probably just be an additional reward for people already logged in. The goal is to log players in as much as possible and dailies do that better (it's why every MMO does them while few MMOs do dailies).
---
There is... So very much Arena Net could do to improve the UI. They could let us track the following:
---
* Story quests
---
* Crafting recipe requirements (like Mystic Clovers)
---
* Unlockable skins/dyes
---
* Map Completion
---
* Personally-picked Armour Sets for Fashion Wars purposes
---
As well as let us choose to enable individual quota bars which we can set to either track our bank, amount of *new* gold gained, or Map Completion %.
---
Ah, but that is a pipe dream.
---
Wiki says hi
---
Meh not really. If he had a 1% chance to get the dye, it would still be 1% and 99%. Just because there’s only two outcomes, it doesn’t mean that it has to be 50-50

Thank you so so much!! ;o;

As a thief main I have to disagree. Sure, you can be powerful in a PvP game but if we’re talking **top-tier** then deadeye does not make the cut.

There we go with the Menzies meme again.

It's pronounced "Kadeem" or "Gadeem" depending on the accent.

Personally I hope they don't increase ways to get keys. if keys started becoming abundant they would just nerf the chests even harder to compensate IMO
---
but still not Quadim :D

Set it to 1, or you can find your own sweet spot.

The old Kessex Hill screen was crazy cool, sad it wasn't a real place in the game
---
Yeah I agree 100%.
---
In their old form? Not really. Those were more like "weeklies" with how easy they were to complete and how little they gave. And one of their primary purposes was to add more AP at a time, but by now a lot of folks have gotten very close to maxing the daily/monthly cap so as they were would be useless to most players.
---
Thanks for explanations. I didn't know I needed to learn that. Impressive.

As a MAGI member proud to support this!

Roaming for rewards was never a thing. People just did it for fun. Same for old GvGs

Good point—I think I’m definitely due for a break. I’ll return once the next chapter is out :)

Path of Exile is amazing if you can make a commitment to learning a new game.  I think dungeon crawlers can be pretty cathartic compared to the frustration of pugging in GW2; you get to build up a character well beyond your "limits" in GW2 and go ham.  There are some ridiculously silly, fun and awesome builds that you can put together.  Getting valuable drops in this game feels *amazing.*
---
I've put in something like 200-250 hours in since June, and I have no plans of stopping.  GW2 is a good game and it's putting out a pretty regular amount of casual living story content and festivals, but the game needs new elite specializations sooner rather than later.  If we assume that LS5 is going to last ~ 6 episodes, then that's another 12-18 months until we *maybe* get another expansion. 
---
Elite Specializations in GW2 are core to the game's PvE &amp; PvP because they provide varying gameplay patterns.  You have different goals and combinations of weapons, traits and utilities relative to the intended purpose of a build.  In my opinion GW2's current iteration of elite specializations is getting really stale, and it's hard to stay motivated when the gameplay is aging.
---
Don't you have goals, long term goals anymore ?
---
Yes they do
---
Or they can add option for instance reset, you know...
---
i agree with you. Additionally to that im always getting sad that we dont have land polearms in the game
---
What? No! QUADIM!
---
Thanks, [getting that fixed](https://github.com/baaron4/GW2-Elite-Insights-Parser/pull/409/files) :)
---
Honestly, people that have issues with others should just contact support and block them. Messages like these are bound to make the get teased even more.
---
Holosmith is a great all rounder for PvP. But every spec but renegade has meta build.
