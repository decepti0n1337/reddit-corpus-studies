Logging in is fine, but for the last month they've been making the LS4 episodes available again after the initial window for people.  They were doing this by making them 0 gem purchases in the gem store for one week each.  That's what you're seeing there.
---
---
---
[removed]
---
Lol.
---
that would be great, but I'd be fine with just it being turned into a novelty
---
They would just pick the trait which gives 5s bonus Berserk time and be done with it.
---

---
Between 3 skills (7 8 9 keys) which can fit in the middle slots, with exception of Outrage which is valued for a low cooldown stunbreak, rest are situational increases at best.
---
Sundering Leap vs Peak performance Bull's Rush? I'll stick with Bull's Rush tbh, if only because the cooldown is better meaning more CC and chances to proc Peak Performance.
---
Wild blow is a 3 second increase vs again, 3 charges of Kick with Peak performance.
---
I would still use Shattering Blow but gotta pick between it and Outrage which is a 10s Stunbreak which gives 5 seconds of Berserk on breaking a stun.
---
I honestly rather upkeep Peak Performance than upkeep Bloody Roar Berserk mode which will end any way regardless if I blow 2 extra 20 - 30~ cooldown skills with low utility.
---
Rip my sweet GoE. I knew thee well
---
When im buying something, id like to know what. is that strange? idk maybe just me
---
Anyone have idea if PoF will be soon on sale?
---
I'm unfamiliar with the law though.  From what I've read I'm sure other games have just fully blocked that sort of content from Belgium, which if applied to GW2 would just completely remove the ability to open BL chests.  If Belgians can still get the level 10 key then it means Anet hasn't gone for the burnt bridges approach.
---
Yeet
---
waitaminute did somebody give me gold??? omg thank you what do i do with gold
---
You can't play berserker and be BS at the same time, it would be ridiculously bad. Much better off with core warrior for that. Berserker is meant to be a personal damage option but it's very lacking in damage as of current.
---
No its only needed to play the content.
---
Well said post...!  I do sort of disagree with this tho:
---
&gt; I still want more active involvement and seeking player feedback from devs...
---
I think this is never going to happen (and probably shouldn’t)...  The VAST majority of the player base instantly goes defensive and hates/complains about any changes to their class—even good ones.  Anet taking the instant-doom-and-gloom cries of the general population to heart would lead to nothing good.  Especially because a lot of players don’t even understand their class/the game.   
---
I could list many examples, but a quick one that comes to mind is how just, so, so, so many Revenant players hate offhand sword and want its changes reverted.  They legitimately want to give up a huge source of burst and arguably one of the top three mobility skills in the game to get back a 2 second block, despite the fact that oh sword is probably the biggest thing keeping the class competitive in PvP atm.  
---
While sometimes it may seem that the anet devs don’t understand their game (especially with glyph of stars, which I agree is straight up baffling), letting all the players have a voice before they’ve even actually seen the skills is just as bad, if not worse.   
---
Maybe they could have select players test things on an ongoing beta server, that could be interesting/highly productive I think.
---
Look in your hero panel under Story Journal and then click through all LS4 episodes. You don’t have those with the 200Gem tag but those without are available to play(when you have PoF).
---
*You didn’t have to massacre my children*
---
Friend tested it and claimed that Bloody Roar is bugged and only gives 10% damage increase as of current, but I haven't tested that myself to confirm it to be true. I guess it might explain a lot since people are saying the damage of berserker is still really bad.
---
Yeah, if I could get ahold of the Unbound (or volatile) sets I'd certainly pick them up, but unfortunately they're not available with no clear indication of when they will be again.
---
To preserve the way birthday gifts work and a reason to reach a 2nd b-day on each character.. the birthday blaster would have to be locked in the novelty slot if your character hasn't reached the 2nd birthday.  Is what I would suggest.  This way you don't have a bunch laying around taking up space.
---
That's why they have said that S5 is going to shake thinks up as they noted that the community was getting tired of the S3/S4 formula.
---
This is what confuses me about op's post. It seems like the entirety of the post may be summed up with: give me just one button to push to do everything.
---
They lower druids offensive support in favor of more defensive support. If I wanted to play a support with these traits, I wouldn't be playing druid in the first place. Where is the diversity?
---
I shit you not I thought I was on r/imsorryjon
---
I see it as "we got hit hard with layoffs, let's make the game look more profitable so we don't get hit again"
---
Providing regen, protection, and vigor on druid is currently amounted to spamming your spirit skills off CD. Regen and protection right now *is trivial*, requiring very minimal skill and is extremely passive. Something like Glyph of the Stars, which has a long channel and is punishing if you don’t stand in it, is more active.
---
And again, this actually frees up a utility *and* healing skill. It’s not a matter of trivializing boon support (there would be no change in boon output except for vigor, but that can be reworked to have a decreased duration if it’s *really that much of an issue*). It’s a matter of introducing more flexibility, which increases the quality of life of a class without making it dominant like GoE did.
---
Full spirits is just lame.
---
Everything in the pack is cosmetic only rewards. If you are new and thinking about spending money on the game there are many things you should pickup first that would improve your gameplay/quality of life before you start buying cosmetics.
---
We have changed the “Steal” skill on Daredevil to a new skill called “Shitty Steal” that is the same as steal but slightly worse.
---
I've been told by someone in Belgium that they don't get keys anymore regardless of how they do it.  They said they did even the lvl 10 story without doing it after months and didn't get one.  Unless things changed since (which I doubt).
---
I found this page on the wiki https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Lion_Outfit_Ticket
---
The bonus events looks really good, I just hope Anet doesn't mess it up and let some exploits get through.
---
I'd rather live in a world where I could buy the products I wanted, like I used to. You know, rather than being forced to gamble if I want to make a purchase. Because it turns out exploiting gambling addicts and children who don't know better is actually more profitable than selling an honest product. So they stop selling direct purchases of items, and just sell mystery boxes.
---
Whole lotta choice I'm seeing when every new AAA multiplayer game is rolling out loot crates. I sure love all this freedom of choice. I get two whole choices. Either gamble - or don't!
---
I don't.
---
I'm afraid your math is way off for scenario B, since it doesn't matter which order you get your most preferred and second most preferred in, as long as you get them both. So, if you use the adoption license first, you have a 2/15 or 13.3% chance of getting one of them, then a 100% from the select licence of getting the other. That's 13.3% chance of getting the desired outcome.
---
Don't settle for that! Demand a sylvan hound themed mount pack!
---
Master of Manipulation trait is in chaos; Chaos isn't really run in pve in the first place

The thing is, they DO balance based on player feedback: They balance based on the people crying the loudest on reddit/forums (nerf chrono and druid, buff deadeye, nerf condi), and they nerf whichever class is the highest on SC's benchmarks, regardless of how viable that class actually is (nerfs to berserker, staff ele, renegade, spellbreaker).
---
It’s not like these boons are rare.
---
If other specs fail to upkeep them, then they should receive buffs instead of gutting a play style and making it passive.
---
 rotation is sloppy...but a fluid rotation didnt bring me above 30k - dont wanna grind too much. had some tries without headbutt (outside opening) and was around 29,8k
---
I think Earth autos have to be limited because Earth can get immunity to crits if traited for it and also gain protection.
---
Thematically I don’t mind it being a spike attack. Staff and sceptre already throw rocks or spikes.
---
Earths only strong attacks, staff 2 and dagger 5 both have long wind ups which seems like a good compromise for the protection that earth can offer.
---
isn't the new decapitate suppose to instantly recharge if it hits? it's not working for me
---
This ^
---
Imo druid should be the norm of what a support should be able to provide, it has pros and cons to it as well. 
---
While yes. For good grps 1druid is mosre than enough healing, for pugs it lost certainly is not which is why pugs run double healer (or triple) comps with (sometimes) different specs. And any boon problem in that regard is NEVER an issue since hey, you had 2goe, all spirits, warhorn 5 for each sub 
---
But in high end grps where you want to run riskier comps with 1 or 0 healers is where all the gimping and nerfs happen, instead of course bussing the the capabilities of other supports to be "greedy"
---
I can see it being useful in Volcanic Fractal for example, like a larger Healing Spring. The 72s cd (traited) is too much though. Maybe 60s or less would be better. IMO, too weak of an elite at its current state.
---
I absolutely will! I originally had a herald crazy healing tank build but now with renegade and the changes they've made throughout now it seems that it has more of a support ability that I will definitely dust him off respect his armor and see what he is capable of!
---
Yes, but it is 2g \*once\* per day. That's confused me :)
---
Yeah the bug seems to happen if you queue up any skill (including auto attack) while casting a banner. Super annoying.
---
Ooh i want to see your herald crazy healing tank build! I can't live without swiftness. Lol. And herald just seems to be better cuz perma pumps. I try to stray off meta and make some decent survivability build too.
---
It does matter because one is a GUARANTEED pick and one is RANDOM.
---
We have so many other long skirt outfits though, it seems strange to make such a huge restriction to avoid a graphical hitch that already exists in many other places.
---
You seem confused, and I'm confused by the wording of your post, so I'm just going to explain how the whole system works and hope that answers your question:
---
Living World episodes cost gems in the gem store.
---
You will automatically unlock the most recent living world episode for free just by logging in. It will unlock even if you are on a free to play account. For example, if you created a brand new account today and logged in, you would permanently unlock season 4 episode 5 for your account for free. You would not unlock any previous episodes.
---
There has been a weekly event going on for the last few weeks that has been offering episodes from season 4 for free in the gemstore. During the first week of the event, season 4 episode 1 was available for 0 gems. During the second week of the event season 4 episode 2 was available for 0 gems, but season 4 episode 1 went back to full price. This continued in a similar fashion every week. It is now week 5, which would have offered season 4 episode 5 for 0 gems, but players will already unlock it right now just for logging in so there's no point putting it in the gemstore.
---
Season 1 is no longer available in game and cannot be played by anyone, due to the method used to implement the episodes.
---
Season 2 episodes can be played by anyone with the episodes unlocked.
---
Season 3 episodes can only be played if you own the HoT expansion, even though you can unlock the episodes without owning the expansion.
---
Season 4 episodes can only be played if you own the PoF expansion, even though you can unlock the episodes without owning the expansion.
---
This is to say, if you are on a free to play account and have logged in recently, you already unlocked Season 4 episode 5. You will not be required to purchase this episode to play it, but you will be unable to play it until you purchase PoF.
---
You may have also unlocked Season 4 episodes 1, 2, 3, or 4 if you "purchased" them from the gemstore for 0 gems while they were available there for free during the current ongoing event. Again, if this is the case then you have unlocked those episodes, but will be unable to play them until you purchase PoF.
---
WoW ... DPS and food choice ( top qualifiers )  **resets stats for PVE**
---
The fact that one is guaranteed and one is random is precisely why you should do the random one first. If you do the random one first, there's a 2/15 chance you get one of the two want on the first attempt, and a 100% chance you get the other you want on the second.
---
If you do it the other way, there's a 100% chance you get one of the two you want first, and a 1/14 chance you get the other second.
---
2/15 chance of getting the two you want is much better than 1/14 chance.
---
I sadly trashed it because all it had was just insane healing output. Great for WvWvW running with a small group of 2-3. Everything else is selfish haha! Tons of blocking and invulnerability use that what would have is who I roamed with would die and I would just runaway with 3 guys trying to kill me with all they could.
---
In fractals I could tank/block a lot of attacks that killed everyone. But other then dragging on a fight for hours you could not win since damage output was shit.
---
As far as I can recall I was using Vitality - Toughness - healing power on everything. I ran staff along with sword and shield (shield 100% forgot main hand) for traits I used herald and Ventari tree's. I basically stayed in Ventari stance forever using shield and staff skills to block and dodge everything. Then in oh shit moments I had the herald skill that casts that shield dome skill on critical. Then I could cast it AGAIN! While using tablet to heal me back to full health. Switch to glint activate and use all signet's and repeat weapon skills. Then when I was back to full health I just stayed in tablet till I critical again.
---
TLDR: because I threw up a lot of shit
---
Herald tank build had way to high healing output and selfish survivability.
---
Repeater also shows up after you use the 3 skill with pistol/dagger, its not just an empty hand skill.
---
True, although it would be positively silly of them to miss such a golden opportunity. It also seems a bit odd that they started the Welcome Back thing halfway through the Super Adventure Festival; they could easily have delayed it a week or two to line up with the actual release if it ends up coming out later in May without anyone being the wiser, so why double up unless you have a deadline to meet?
---
&gt; competitive environment.
---
I laughed at this. The mount might have some issues but the current balance with Mobility/Stealth/Buffs/CDs is so insanely bad.
---
Is someone forcing you to buy gem store stuff?
---
Honestly, Decapitate seems to be doing very low damage. It's pretty disappointing.
---
The female meta truly has changed at an alarming rate
---
Really brings me back to the days of playing the first Guild Wars. This was my favorite class, and I was so excited to see they made this reference in game with an outfit!
---
There's a theory that he killed Menzies awhile ago thus enabling him to turn his attention to the dragons. There's a scepter called "The Fate of Menzies" that's a horned, burning head on a stick. But think about it, he died and his mantle was shed in a magic explosion. Where did it go?
---
Took my Daredevil to ranked. One of my teammates asked me why I was even playing thief. I’m very well known in NA ranked PvP and that really hurt for me to read because WHY DOES ANET BUFF EVERYBODY BUT THIEVES
---
This finally did me in. I come home exhausted as hell and I sit down to see this and I just can't deal with it right now
---
Time to retire thief to the winterberry farms. Again.
---
And what are you wearing *now*?
---
*giggles in Memebeast speak*
---
I've done a solid rotation with axe/axe alone and pushed it to 29.5k DPS without infusions, it's really consistent. However, I've gotten 36k DPS bursts with a really difficult gs+axe/axe rotation that I believe can hit 32k+ DPS but it's so difficult and unrealistic that I don't think I wanna bother grinding it out.
---
No pay to win, no subscription, no RNG in the package itself (just in keys that it contains) and great value for its price.
---
Of all the nasty things the monetization people could do, this is not one of them.
---
You think GW2's microtransactions are overpriced? Compared to what market? 2010's? 
---
You can make a separate argument that gaming as a whole is in a bad place right now with microtransactions as a whole but a claim that GW2's are not right in line with the current market for cosmetics just doesn't hold any water.
---
So..you are telling me that Berserker is now viable in both power and condi?
---
Yeah. People should focus on how they do it, not whether they  do it or not.
---
Those bills won't pay themselves even if we got Universal Basic income.
---
What exactly impact DD so heavily again in PvP outside steal range?
---
/signed
---
You can make a separate argument that gaming as a whole is in a bad place right now with microtransactions but a claim that GW2's are not right in line with the current market for cosmetics just doesn't hold any water unless you literally haven't played any other games that have microtransactions. Hell GW2's prices are in line with MMO's that also require subscriptions.
---
And "You can get a few new games for less than X" is a pretty empty argument when you can get games for pennies thanks to digital sales. By that ridiculous comparison literally anything you buy that isn't an entirely new game is a bad value proposition.
---
Looking through my wardrobe I saw these shorter tops available for humans.
---
The noble coat or the lunatic noble coat if you want something a bit rough.
---
The Duelist coat
---
The Priory medium armor
---
Vigil armor
---
Scout's coat (human only)
---
Strider's tunic (gem only)
---
Which is weird because I would *love* to play that version of sylvari.
---
Or at least increase the distance of the evades. Dash sometimes feels as slow as if you were dashing place even with that 450 unit distance it's supposed to cover, and Bounding Dodger in particular feels like you are not covering any distance at all.
---
For most power builds Ferocity is effectively equal to, or very slightly better than power.  There are a few exceptions to that, but that's generally true.  
---
Precision is definitely better than Power point for point.  However, power is, for all intents and purposes, equivalent to precision on buffs because you can freely swap between power and precision with food, infusions and zerk &lt;-&gt; assassin gear to hit your required precision levels.
---
It's just a start. Now that Steal and Swipe are separate skills, they can be changed separately.
---
If they see 600 range is too short, hopefully they'll change that, but the important thing is that any future changes will be separate from changes to Steal.
---
"make healing more interesting by changing this skill"
---
suggests to change skill by removing its unique aspects and having it provide higher uptime on generic boons
---

Human - Mesmer / Thief

Make it a Boss Week instead just a weekend, and we have a deal.
---
18 in most of the world, but ya.
---
Kill for that helmet piece as a standalone
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
Druid will always be meta in PvE as long as it has the best buffing capabilities. 
---
Better to have support specs be well-rounded than one-sided. Druid actually has some of the best healing of any spec when traited properly.
---
Right click them.
---
They come with a glyph, so you'd be replacing it, not adding to it.  Putting a different glyph on the Unbound Magic tools would return the first glyph to your inventory to use on a different tool.
---
which makes it unique in regards to aoe channels
---
u/skelk_lurker what do you think of this?
---
https://gfycat.com/diligentgaseoushusky
---
I'm assuming even just the longbow autoattacks prevented them from appearing.
---
Not every class gets buffed. Guardians have mainly been getting these weird asides, that aren't really buffs or nerfs just "ANet clearly doesn't know what else to do here anymore" things. Which isn't necessarily bad as Guardian has honestly been pretty stable in multiple game modes with multiple builds for quite a while now.
---
Charr elementalist can get flamed tails... that’s enough of a reason for me
---
also guy doesnt think past a single raid wing where sure this skill may not be useful.
---
forgets raids are like 10% of the game and this skill could actually end up being used alot in other aspects of the game.
---
The changes to beastmastery made hybrid soulbeast a actually somewhat workable dps build! As far as gear goes, I'm not sure I had the most optimal setup, as the main goal of the build is to reach crit cap and bleed cap, so there's definitely room for improvement. I doubt this build will ever see any real play do to relying on whirling in fire fields, but it's a fun build that combines a little bit of power and condi soulbeast into a weird package.
---
Yep.  They are.  I hate this.  They replace the f1 burst and should count as t3 bursts.  At least berserk mode counts for 3 stacks.
---
Stop posting terrible memes back to back is a good start.
---
&gt;Furthermore you've suggesting removing the unique effects
---
Because they are worthless with such a long cooldown. There is 0 reason to use new glyph for this "unique" effect.
---
As long as they give us enough space in the novelties for it and easy ways to access.
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
They decided to make it super spammable rather than super high damage...which is kind of funny. Its predecessor from GW1 was specifically made as the biggest damage axe skill, but it got rid of all energy and adrenaline, so you can't use it often and it pretty much makes you unable to use any other skills for a little bit.
---
outside of that, the tradeoff for range is something that's quite worthless.
---
thieves can already get an unblockable steal (and unblockable anything, really) with basilisk venom, one of the most commonly used elites in the game.
---
and even without basilisk venom, a traited steal can punch through almost everything short of channeled blocks, evades, and invulns, due to traited steal's interrupt and boon stripping capabilities.
---
it'd be a lot more interesting if the new Swipe is more fundamentally changed. for example, i think it'd be interesting if Swipe is a leap instead of a teleport. but as of now, Swipe is nothing more than a downgraded version of steal, and that's both uninteresting and an unneeded nerf to daredevil.
---
It's too bad they apparently stopped making new mail carriers. :(
---
From what game mode perspective? The changes were overall a buff for PvE
---
If *all* the players had 1000g, you can be sure the price of the Supply Drop will be closer to 240000 gems.
---
&gt; Banners: Adjusted timing for skill warm-up visual effects.
---
Its fun having banners be broken. Even if you let the cast time finish when casting a second one it will eat the first.
---
I think it's an overpriced gimmick to get more money out of people who absolutely can't resist a "sale". 
---
There's zero reason for the price to increase as time goes on, since they're the ones that set the price. Notice how they don't frame it as the price increasing, but rather as people getting "less of a discount". It's pure psychological manipulation.
---
Other than that, I don't think the content is worth the asking price. It costs nearly as much as the expansions.
---
thanks! i hate it
---
Yeah, wouldn’t want them to pay their employees, the bills, and have a profitable game.  Don’t fall for a company trying to make money selling cosmetic items that aren’t required!
---
Auric Basin when shiny bauble is in rotation!
---
While I agree that something is to be desired from the glyph in pve, I can definitely see this glyph as something meant for wvw. An immunity to condi application is massive in wvw. The fact that it resses people as well is just the cherry on top.
---
In pve, the only optimal use you'll get out of it is vigor as the only sources of it on druid are rather limited (traited pet swap and sun spirit activate). You wouldn't really need prot now because there's no reason to run anything else in place of goe and you didn't need regen because of healing spring. With that said, it's clear that it belongs in a pvp format rather than pve and your proposed changes are pretty heavy-handed. I think the boon duration could be increased a little to give maybe 60-80% uptime assuming verdant etching and perma alac but that's about it.
---
Like when they let raid guilds into beta tests about 3 years ago?
---
Yea... that worked great.  {sarcastic eyeroll}
---
&gt; relying on whirling in fire fields
---
:(
---
At scenario B, you have a chance to roll your most and second most selected mounts at the same time, isnt that single roll a 2/15? And the 100% second pick comes only after that.
---
..I should have known from the font.
---
Reminds me of Vermintide.
---
I think you are way over exaggerating this.
---
I don't think its at all unreasonable for an adult to dictate how they spend money in a video game.
---
I don't think the government has any place in a decision like that.
---
The point where governments should step in is far beyond something simple like a personal video game microtransaction.
---
My emphasis is on using the tricks ie. rng/gambling boxes which most of the contents are. Sell items up front.
---
Does it still grant that 10 adrenaline when you're not in berserk mode?
---
&gt;search and rescue
---
Maybe if your group is bad
---
&gt;Protect me
---
On any other fights than sloth, why? Even on sloth you could have daredevils steal skill to group stun break
---
&gt;Guard
---
Why? Not really great for group support
---
&gt;Muddy terrain
---
Not necessary on many fights. If you need immobs then run jacaranda
---
&gt;Glyphs
---
Alignment is bad if you're running support, if you need the raw healing that badly then something is wrong with you or your group is facetanking too much damage. Tides is ok in some scenarios but mostly useless. Unity is ok but it's the same deal as with alignment. Equality might be nice for the extra cc but if your group hasn't been struggling with breakbars then there isn't but reason to take it.
---
Ultimately, you'll just take stone spirit so the group has perma prot for better scholar uptime
---
&gt;I'd rather live in a world where I could buy the products I wanted, like I used to.
---
But that's not what they have done here.  They have taken away the ability to purchase most of the things entirely.  I don't think it's the right decision.
---
So why not just make sure using superior pounce puts you into combat?
---
I'll come back when thief is better and we can 1v1 again which might not be ever.
---
&gt;somewhat workable
---
yes
---
Don't. I tell people if they want heals, they hug the tablet or a warband member, because if they don't I'm not bothering to chase their ass and leave others to die.
---
You're right
---
Robert Gee previewed HoT chrono with a fucking staff in PvE, that tells you everything about how these people approach the game.
---
Not sure about it being balanced but don't those 3 boons have almost 100% uptime anyway, in a "normal" raid scenario?
---
It may shock you to hear it, but there are a lot of people who don't run 100% meta comps everywhere.
---
Even in meta comps, you'll be getting prot from chrono shield phantasms and alacriade spirits at a minimum.
---
Until you realize you'll get mostly soft and green wood.
---
Don't like it, don't buy it. Simple.
---
Instead it will be a foam pool noodle with a hilt.
---
If you want to play both roam and Zerg on the same char, I would go with the spellbreaker because thieves usually get booted from squads. 
---
Nothing stopping you from playing both however
---
&gt;They are not fun. 
---
I find them fun.
---
Couldn't have said it better myself.
---
Ok I thought I was just going crazy because I kept losing track of one of the banners. Turns out it's a bug, thank f--k. Assuming it'll get fixed quickly, cause it's pretty bad.
---
I like how they said in the past that the raid wing is basically finished already but they still didn’t finish it until now :)
---
Yikes
---
I think so, I guess Anet uses your IP to determine your location.
---
Use some server somewhere else and it should work.  It may be enough to just activate it to buy stuff.
---
https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/the-arenanet-streaming-schedule-for-the-week-of-april-22/
---
Scepter, staff, focus would make the most sense as they usually used staves in the first game but focus would be a good psuedo urn item.
---
Warrior is easier to pick up and arguably easier to play, thanks to it's built-in defenses, high damage, and decent mobility. Also, warrior excels at 1vX fights, especially spellbreaker. It also has greatswords so if you like them there's something in favor of this class for you.
---
Thief is harder to learn and probably to master because of low defenses and higher complexity, but it has excellent mobility and can spike down opponents if you time well your attacks (i'm not refering to bursting down lowies from stealth but to legit figths).
---
I find this thief he most fun to play but a warrior main will say the same about their class, so I suggest you watch videlos and streams of each class, try both a little, and stick to the one you most enjoy (or both if you like playing multiple professions).
---
Aye, the lil drone thingy is frickin' adorable! Would LOVE to have it as a Mail Carrier! :D

There is no reason armor would take much longer than outfits.

Who you again?

Money. It cost money to develop an alternative. And it probably isn't profitable, or ArenaNet thinks it isn't profitable to develop an alternative. So the restriction is ArenaNet's decision, not that of the Belgium government. The Belgium government is just more consistent in applying the gambling laws in their country (or have more balls to do that). I just hope more countries will follow (preferable some big ones, come on Germany and France!) so ArenaNet (and other game developers/publishers) has to develop alternatives for gambling related loot boxes. After that the rest of the EU hopefully follows.

Patch on my birthday?! NANI!?

Love some of the new mount skins though!

Can you grow up?

Lots of the bottle necking happens at the CPU level and only on one CPU core. It doesn't handle multi-threading well. When you have 100+ players all at once in say WvW it slows everything down, best thing you can do is limit character models.
---
There's only 1 podcast on the list and it's in german.
---
the only thing i'm looking into herald is boons. i wonder if herald could get perma alacrity? xd or i'm just too noob for this class to understand. lol &gt;&lt;
---
Staff is already used as a melee weapon for the revenant. I could see the scepter being used, or Anet could pull another Spellbreaker and provide us two weapons at once (scepter + focus).

If there was no Ele around in the group I would suggest we keep that as a new feature :p
---
So I messed with Druid a fair bit in WvW today, and the new elite is actually pretty potent. Blocking condis entirely is a pretty big deal when Scourge bombs are so decisive, you can't play upfront like a Firebrand would and I'm not sure if it's enough to put Druid on par with Firebrand, but it's a huge step up of pre-patch Druid for WvW, imo.
---
teatime would be your best bet

OP didnt specify a language and basically any live-stream that has been made available on demand is a podcast.
---
well I've updated it now so that nobody gets shamed ;)
---
that's what you get when you vaccinate yourself

if every game that had microtransactions became an instant 18 / 21 age restricted title with ratings on the box and actual legal punidhments for selling them to children regardless, lootboxes would die out faster than you can say Shazam.

Could make a specialization change the purpose of a weapon.

Hosts of Ascalon in spotify.

Bad reputation. At begining it used to not have open source and do have network code in it.
---
Just everything that is wrong with guild wars 2 today. Make people pay for some nostalgia and fan service yet there is no substance. This series really has lost its way.
---
Asc Gear is only Acc Bound, not Soulbound.  That means yes u can craft ur Armor on a other Charakter. By Exo Gear so far i know it works too, so long u not use it.
---
Third endurance bar, improved dodge roll?
---
why does it not work with sleight of hand?  what does that mean?  is it bugged?  or do you just not want to ever use it because it's closer range
---
Yeah, now I'd just like a better visual to see how long my berserk-mode is active.. kinda like lifeforce, it would be nice to have an indicator as to how long time I have left.  
---
Either by means of a cooldown timer on the f1 icon or changing berserk burst skills into flat cd's and make the berserk adrenaline slowly decay as time goes on.
---
An other Guardians here testing [Zealot's Defense](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Zealot%27s_Defense) for its damage has been increased by 50%?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
On the tooltip it states that its gonna hit 8 times and should deal more damage than those 7 hits of [Whirling Wrath](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Whirling_Wrath), but anyways ingame it only hits four times.
---
Is this skill bugged / glitched in PvE?
---
Thats sad, was looking forward to use 1H sword for fractals etc.
---
Sc/w Tempest is also above 30k dps bench anyway https://youtu.be/DL4aQShmSxA
---
What do you mean? I can hit a well playing daredevil roughly 4 times per minute. Don't you see how unsafe that is?
---
To be honest, it's more "meta build or we're carrying your ass", in some places.
---
Sylvari Soulbeast!   
---
I run the t3 cultural with GS caladbolg and Kudzu longbow. You literally look like a plate of salad but if that's your thing, great combo!
---
There is a bug with the new glyph, though: it doesn't trigger Verdant Etching, and subsequently doesn't trigger Grace of the Land. Not like it's gonna change much, though, since the glyph won't see much PvE use outside of some very particular situations (e.g. denying Sloth's shake), but a bug's a bug.
---
I'm not saying there shouldn't be easy builds at all, or that they should be performing as poorly as to not be able to complete content efficiently. But I really don't think there's good risk/reward balance when it comes to complex builds. Mostly because they tend to be much less reliable. Mistakes in these builds lead to much bigger performance drops and they generally require more of your attention to be played efficiently meaning less of that same attention is free for doing mechanics or staying alive. The performance gaps are small enough so they don't really justify all that extra risk. 
---
And it's not like I'm playing ele "because I like min-maxing". No, I'm playing ele because this is what I play since launch. It's my class. So my choice is either "git gud" or "play something you don't enjoy". As you can surely imagine, forcing such a choice onto you doesn't feel particularly good. And it doesn't help when you choose to git gud and you encounter an actual good player playing one of the current FotM builds. Then it just feels like a lot of wasted effort.
---
&gt;Nobody asked for a berserker spec rework, especially not after 3.5 years of it being in-game. 
---
I've seen so many posts from people crying they wanted berserker to be a power spec again though...
---
and then after adding tools, they can add another category for any portal scrolls/lounge passes (permenant passes only obviously), and then another so we don't have to carry around/burn a chunk of storage for books.
---
Sure, but that doesn't necessarily require redesigning the entire spec.
---
I am kind of shocked at how bad focus 4 and warhorn 5 is on necro. They can't crit and the life steal is small. 
---
I am so confused as to why they put in work to change them to this. I am not sure if they meant these changes as a nerf or a buff.
---
The increased range on gs5 in pvp is nice though. Especially in colloseum, dragging people off boxes.
---
Is 42 better than 61?
---
Need👏more👏
---
yeah just sad, also i think power classes outclasses condi more and more, when condi does the same dps as power theres something wrong (they dont get their dmg cut off from phases, invuls etc.), while they always overperform them in burst fights like fractals
---
Seems you miss the point of all this.
---
And in terms of fairness ... the over all gem cost for the items you get are above what you pay.
---
It feels like an premium membership thing, thank god it’s only cosmetic.
---
they can rez you when you are completely dead and they are out of combat, that is enough
---
Illusions most of the time if you want to optimal
---
that's wh
---
Friendly reminder to anyone at Anet that there are indeed still a few Holosmiths left. We don't need much, actually we just want acknowledged ;_;
---
I have been playing power shatter since long because I played wvw more than pvp before and it just seemed more viable than condi there. With this patch I am sure there would be massive nerfs to power shatter soon because people will keep crying rather than learn to play against 5 skills. It is like they buff a little but as per history when they do nerfs it is like they break both the legs with bats.
---
Its apparent from blinding and mirror changes in dueling trait. I really can't understand the reasoning behind them. It was like okay so you have 2 good traits, why not we nerf both of them instead of one so you have nothing good left.
---
 I kinda justify some changes to mesmer though, scepter 3 was ridiculous tbh, being a condi weapon it did too much damage, however with this + scepter 2 nerf I think it is no longer viable. 
---
And the superspeed buff is useless, there are better stealth options, than wasting a mesmer elite just for stealth.

[no more](https://www.reddit.com/user/unpopularinfusion)

hb and all utility skills shoud have been reworked to be physical atk,but as i was expecting,this is alpha version of new berserker,so its gona be in beta in next 6 months. casting time is there for no reason,12 sec cd where you cant burst is just dumb and WHEN YOU AS ONLY CLASS GET DEBUFF -300 toughness,BCS YOU WANA DEAL DMG is retarded,at least in curent state.
---
&gt; when you're out of berserker, rage skills give adrenaline
---
Can you really not generate 30 adrenaline in 10-15 seconds it takes berserker mode to recharge? You must be doing something very wrong then.
---
Now if rage skills would instead reduce the cooldown on berserker mode...
---
Please, tell me about all the options you have when an algorithm is determining what you actually paid for. I'll wait.
---
And really, a 300% mark up without loot crates? Quite the imagination you have. That markup is already a reality. I mean really - 250 gems for a revive orb, a one time utility item, costs more than an entire map with story content? It's worth 20 gems at the most. And it's priced that way to make the crates look appealing. Value obfuscation and RNG prevent normal market forces from working properly by exploiting addiction, ignorant children, and the mathematically inept.
---
I'm sure some desperate shareholders would insist on sticking with that pricing model, eager to make yet another quick buck and see how much further they could push gaming, already the most consumer hostile market in the economy, into bold new frontiers of exploitative monetization  - really go for broke, you know? And hopefully go broke in the process. Some whales might be willing to eat that shit, but I doubt the majority would. And if the majority would, I really cannot fathom what goes on in their minds. Here's my prediction for what would happen if lootboxes were deleted from existence: rather than taking from addicts who can't say no, or tricking children and the mathematically inept by using value obfuscation, publishers would be forced to sell their products at market value, or starve. Just like every other market. I don't know if you remember when microtransactions actually were micro. A few dollars for a skin, if that. But there was such a time. And hopefully, it may be returning.
---
Sounds like a perfect plan to me.
---
If you cut out the dyes and even the statuettes entirely you're still saving gems buying the bundle for the 2 skins and makeover kit. You're getting all 3 for a lower price, and also getting a bonus of random dyes and a currency.
---
Yes it does.
---
Eh. Less DPS is good in my opinion. 
---
The new zerker is more about bursting than dps.
---
I don't know what other games you've played, but prices like $30 are not for whales. Whales spend hundreds if not thousands on their chosen games. GW2 is so tame in comparison. If you treated buying gems like a traditional MMO sub, you could buy most of the items available on the gem store.
---
I occasionally buy stuff I'm interested in to support the devs. I'm no whale, I just use money I earn from working like any other person
---
New player here. It's because WoW is on the decline. I honestly didn't think I'd enjoy GW2 this much, but I am loving it! Gonna get to 80 and then buy the expansions
---
The release schedule is a bit rough lately so it's harder to pinpoint when a patch will hit with the amount of data I've got.
---
The 3 weeks is based on the amount of new gemstore we've got available, they always will push a new patch once they run out but sometimes (like this week) they'll push out a patch a week in advance before releasing all the new items.
---
"Heavy armor" gives you 304 defense, compared to light. So with this thing you literally have to same damage resistance as ele, while still having twice as much hp. 
---
Nothing to complain about, really.
---
I hope the same stance on gambling is adopted here, too.
---
Nope, everyone was able to buy them (but not able to play them without the expac). I know I did on my alt vanilla account only.
---
Just development costs and will.  They are pretty resource constrained with respect to improving their code base, but as something so close to revenue I would think they would prioritize it.
---
I see Griever meme is alive and well.
---
they are souldbound you can never have 4 blasters on one char to toilet them
---
One day Anet is going to come up with a use for those extra Mini Queen Jennahs and when it happens every player who's committed Jennahcide will regret it dearly.
---
That doesn't change the bundle being a total of 50 gems more expensive then the 2 skins and the kit. The statuettes and the kits make up the remainder but neither actually have a fixed value since neither can be obtained from the gem store (barring the indirect acquisition of statuettes by store-bought chest keys). So if you're gambling your real money with this dye pack like you're suggesting you'd have to spend a minimum single payment of $35 to get a single dye pack. Directly converting that currency would net you 752 gold guaranteed, compared to gambling 457g worth of it on the only one-time dye pack and directly converting the remaining 1100 gems to a meager 295 gold. The average gold value of these packs is very low, and imagining someone buying this bundle with the goal of gambling is absolutely ludicrous to me.  
---
Instead of gambling on this you could do plenty of other safer gambling methods like buying keys, or converting into gold and using that gold to gamble for precursors, or just converting to gold and calling it a day.  
---
I'm entirely with you complaining about the mount adoption licenses, black lion chests and dye kits that release on their own in the shop-- but I think this is extremely petty and hurts the validity of any complaints about truly abusive and manipulative market practices when people are getting equally worked up about something so minor.
---
&gt; but to be fair everything in the blc is
---
Except its not. You have games that have monthly subs AND a cash shop and their prices either match or are higher than GW2s. To me your comment reeks of "I play GW2 only so these prices are high" when you haven't looked at other games and their prices. 
---
Fun fact: Doing a server change on WoW is $25. Doing one on GW2(even to a high pop) is around $23 to a High Pop, $12 for a Medium and $10 for low.
---
I quite like the design. It comes with a trade off (the long channel) and is a nice alternative on some raidbosses - but its not so OP you are now forced to bring 2 druids again.
---
The changes you want arent taking into account a lot of things. Like quickness, chrono boon extension, other effects of the glyph beside giving boons. Sorry to say, but I fully disagree with your changes.
---
Hot metas - Verdant brink, Tangled depths, auric basin. (Decent money and daily gems)
---
After tarir you can go straight to branded shatterer
---
Then go farm istan for a while until paladawan and GH starts. 
---
Daily fractals.
---
Those should get you started.
---
You have the option to buy gems with in game gold so you don't "gamble" with real life money. For example I tend to spent a fair amount of gold on black lion keys every time they update the chests for the thrill of it. They should give people the option to buy the "banned" items , that their government has blocked , if they buy their gems with in game gold. There is no reason why gambling with in game gold should be banned , like the ecto gamble or the material packages from living story maps , it's an essential piece of the games economy.
---
&gt;I did not at all participate in the shit-slinging that was going on. I made multiple posts expressing how disgusted I was with it
---
That's nice virtue signalling right there. 5/5.
---
&gt;Since that event I have no longer actually felt like I'm part of this sub, nor do i really want to feel that way any more.
---
And yet here you are posting.
---
&gt;It was so wide-reaching and so venomous.
---
If you mean the part when an employee badmouthed customers of a company? Yep that was pretty venomous and had some irritating consequences of attracting incels and other nutters to this sub.
---
I'm pretty sure it was Anet themselves who cited that as a reason though I'm 100% on that ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ . 
---
Also  armor sets are modular and have to be able to fit with other armors which I, making some laymans assumptions, would assume would make it take longer. I would also think needing to be able to split the model at specific points would restrict what you can do with the design.
---
Patch note for this particular skill 
---
Arc Divider: This skill has been reworked. It no longer deals bonus damage to low-health targets. Instead, it now spins and strikes 3 times. Each strike increases in radius.
---
He was so OP. Good times.
---
Can anyone tell me please how long does the might given by Sigil of Ruthlessness (PvP) last? I can't check it online now and I'm not sure if the wikipedia page is right (as it says 5 might stacks for 3 seconds)

staff renegade would be the closest we can get

When i was a teenager (over 10 years ago) i used to go into walmart, open up a box, type the CD key in to my flip phone and put the box back on the shelf. I did this multiple times for my friends for Guild Wars 1 and WoW. None of the CD keys ever got disabled. I never got an email. No GM's messaged me in game. Nothing. I always wondered what happened to the person who bought it. Im sure walmart just exchanged it, reported the loss and never notified ANet or Blizz. Either way, developers still got paid for it in the end and walmart took the loss so i dont feel THAT bad for it...  
---
(disclaimer: i don't condone this. I don't do this anymore. I buy all my games now and every copy i have is legit. I've spent WAY more money buying gems than I care to admit because i felt guilty for my young thieving.)
---
This law is not to protect the customer, they just want to sell a licence and get some money  ;-)
---
&gt; Anet would have to find solution
---
Yea, move to Asia.
---
Just a wild Idea from me. This is the final episode of LW season 4 and this time, it was actually planned to have 6 episodes and not like season 3 with the tucked on ending. Maybe this patch is a bit bigger and actually a two parter. First release beginning of May, where we deal with the consequences from last episodes ending and second half end of May/beginning June where we set up either another assault on Kralk or actively setting up LW5 in a big way.
---
I mean, we can't go around preparations for another attack on Kralk. But I don't see why this should immediately happen within another 2h story patch where we also need to sort out some other stuff that happened. But this gemstore item heavily implies exactly that.
---
Or maybe end of May is correct and the delay is a direct result of the lay offs that happened. But I hope for the future (as in LW5), that with the overall higher headcount working on GW2, the episodes also become a bit longer and handle some things more in-depth than up to now. Maybe with these slip episode formats that we get 2 releases for one episode and both are around 2h long. A man can dream.
---
we would have seen something by now if we had but i wouldn't put it past the writers to do a rowling-esque retcon and introduce it with no foundation supporting it
---
Ooooh that's a big compliment, it's Voices of the Lifestream that made me start doing video games music remixes and motivated me to create this community :D
---
Ty!
---
Coil whine has nothing to do with CPUs. The difference between 1080p and 4K on a 15.6" screen is nearly biologically imperceptible. Also, even if you get a 4K screen, you can run the game at 1080p and it will perform the same as it would on a native 1080p screen.
---
The foundation was already built. They just never followed up on it after the initial introduction of the idea in LW3 episode 1.
---
I use a newer AW 15 with all similar specs to what your looking at (HK chip, 32gb mem, it’s basically max everything with the Max Q video just like your looking at). Very sturdy, easy to carry, easy to use (and you can turn off all the crazy AW lights and junk so it’s basically just a super epic computer once you do that... although I do love backlit keyboard so I leave that one on)
---
My experience with gw2 is flawless.. I play 100% on WiFi and NEVER EVER get lags! (Not meta events, not PvP, not WvW.. I just never ever get lags) so any of those notebooks will be great for gw2.
---
My advice is to get the best warranty over more features (for instance I get the top 5yr Dell/AW full service warranty.. so they send techs to you and you never send the computer away). I also work from my notebook so I cannot allow games to take away (or kill) my computer.
---
You sell the computer when it still has 1-2yrs left on the warranty so it also sells at a much higher turn over point (And is still under active warranty when sold so it’s a perfect pc).
---
My 2nd and greatest of all most usable tip... 
---
Go SSD and ditch any physical HDD. If the machine supports multi SSD then get x2 and use one as storage only (the other as a cloned boot drive). You will get near instant starts for windows and basically just speeds up the machine to a rate where you can never again go back to spinning HDD. (And you keep the SSD so it’s a rolling investment)
---
I actually just clone the out of the box brand new HDD drive onto SSD and disable the original drive (and just leave it in place). This way when you sell the computer you just remove your SSD and internal storage drives. Hook up the original unused HDD that came with the computer and it’s back to brand new (same day you bought it). Now you can sell it quickly and without hassles OR having to do hard drive wipes since... you never used that HDD (you used SSD’s and keep them for your next notebook)
---
After that just install gw2 and kick ass!
---
I doubt anyone buys the ritualist pack, because of the dye package.
---
Exactly.
---
Just curious and looking for somebody to discuss: what's the point in having 2 different power specs? Wasn't the berserker spec meant to be condi altogether from the start? What's the point of having all these burns effects if now condi dps is lower than power? And we already have a core/spellbreaker power build that is viable? What about team utilities? (Banners, phalanx strenght). 
---
This update confuses me, i am missing the point of these "tradeoffs"
---
Thx but no thx, you are a bit too ill-informed to discuss anything.   
---
Cheers
---
Now, if they fix it and make verdant etching activating with each pulse, that's may be interesting. but I highly doubt they will \^\^  
---
On a side note, you can start the cast of Glyph of the star in celestial avatar, immediately exit celestail avatar, and the glyph will keep applying it's celestial avatar effect for the whole 7secs activation.
---
Grognok just trying to return hammer. How Grognok supposed to know hammer so heavy? Grognok carry hammer no problem.
---
which they do anyway. we are simply noz an attractive market anymore
---
And what exactly are "people like me"? 
---
People who want to buy a bundle and not being forced to pay more money for less stuff, only because any knickknack is seen as a "dangerous gambling trap"? 
---
You know I'm right, that's why you answer with a stupid saw and not with an actual argument.

Hi all, can someone confirm that I am able to choose ANY outfit from the BL outfit voucher? There is an outfit, Ice Encasement outfit, that I really want. Would like to be 100% sure before spending 2.4k gems. 
---
Thanks!
---
Also, make the elite reset the cooldown of Berserk so I don't have to leave berserk :)
---
dude that's not constructive criticism, which OP didn't ask for anyway so you're just being rude
---
&gt; Otherwise the promo week they were doing would be really weird.
---
I didn't notice, oh well. It did make sense to me, because it sends the message: "Returning players: buy the expansion now and you'll get LS4 for free!"
---
Every char has to be 2 years old to unlock the blaster. Making it a novelty means every char can use it. And that means on the one hand even chars younger than 2 years are able to use the blaster, and on the other hand newer chars would get one gift less on their 2nd birthday. 
---
See what happend to Queen Jennah mini when minis became unlocked account wide. Your first char unlocked the mini and every further char just have one item to throw away. A pretty bad birthday gift imo.
---
Mini Jennah **with** shoes
---
I just use the numpad, just came back after 6 months of not playing and I still know em all :D
---
how does AR affect concecration? Also can't test that (limited rescources in game and gw2skills not uptodate)
---
Aslong as people tell themselves random dye packs and black lion chests are a fine way to finance a company anet wont change that.
---
The sheer amount of skins that get put on the market every time they change the pool of the blc is ridiculous. So the number of people that buy Keys has to be as extreme. Sure, some stuff is available through the "tokens" you get nowadays with every box, but the true gems that are hidden inside are the one time exclusive things, that might or might not get added later on to the list of items you can redeem via tokens, are the stuff what people are after.
---
In other words. I would be happy to see Anet put less hours into scamming their loyal costumers and produce quality stuff that wants to get bought instead. It seems people are happy to spend 2000 gems (that's 25Euro if you buy those from their website) on one skin, how cant that be enough for some of the BLC exclusive Items?

Wait to judge until people post clean and optimized rotations.

Yeah... problem is, I'm not.

I actually have a short Norn that I head canon as being a tall human. I just like their animations and options much better, especially the staff animations.

What do you mean by "head to louis rossmann youtube". Is that intended to scare me off of apple products? Because that was my first instinct when I saw the front page of the channel
---
BOOM! HEADSHOT!
---
im guessing that they wanted to make alternative builds to the current core meta at the time by using elite specs but they really fucked it up with berserker, it's like they just completely ignored the theme and came up with something just mediocre
---
The Mist Mobility Potion converts AR into Concentration. At 150 AR and a Large Mobility Potion you get 15% Boonduration
---
They are birthday gifts. Look what happened to the Queen Jennah mini. After your first chars first birthday it's not a gift anymore, it's a thing to throw away.
---
Thanks, I'll try it again next year.
---
If you cast one, queue the second and queue autoattack or some other skill, both banners' animation will go off, no banner will spawn, and you will be left with 0 banners and 80 seconds cooldown on both. Can't pick them up either as they technically didn't spawn.

It might either scare or assure you that he can fix anything, but a lot of "inside" details about macs. Very recommended for educational purposes.

berserker *really* should have been a power spec in the first place, which is the main problem with their design of the spec.

That aside, you can't link URLs ingame, so as a commander you have to retype 9 URLs from your game to your browser. That would be really annoying and wouldn't get a common thing imo.
---
If the knickknack instead offered the option to choose your item from a pre-selected and advertised list, then yes.
---
The current implementation, regardless of whether it can be subjectively considered dangerous, is still gambling in a game without an age restriction. Any form of RNG is.

&gt; It's quite literally a business practice that's taught in school son, not a conspiracy theory.

&gt;I swear to god there needs to be some sort of test before being allowed to post online
---
I agree, that would save us all from your rubbish.
---
Some projectiles (especially in dungeons) could be "destroyed" but not "blocked". Now that you cannot destroy them anymore... you dont have to destinguish between blocking and destroyin...?...yay?
---
You can never have too much treasure.
---
Well isn't it the case when you get keys directly from map completion/story? We already have that....
---
Nah, commie government caters to predatory companies, this is the opposite of that.

My favorite design from Factions. Rolled Ritualist just so I could look that cool.
---
Yeah, cause other light armour would actually protect someone.
---
r/unexpectedavatar
---
variety?
---
permanent uptime from a single skill is NOT the direction the game needs to go. if anything the amount of boon uptime needs to be drastically reduced across the board. protection is not as meaningful to gameplay when its up 100% of the time
---
Plot twist: it was a rampaging bear in disguise.
---
Better yet, get rid of "micro"transactions outright and just let us get what we want in the game we bought. Unfortunately that's a completely alien concept to today's AAA industry.
---
festival ones when they are relevant, rest is random

I would say simple shoes make it walking over snow or dry grass a bit less painfull.

Good bot.
---
Mirages as well
---
&gt;  It's clear you have no clue what gambling actually entails
---
Oh, I know, but I just think realistic. 
---
I know that a dye pack contains a random dye and that it's gambling and so on. 
---
But I'm talking about that Ritualist package which contains a dye pack. 
---
By thinking realistic, nobody would fall for gambling because of this package. Nobody, absolutely nobody in the words, would start buying this package over and over again, because he wants to gamble with the dye pack. Therefore my statement -&gt; there is no "dangerous gambling trap".
---
I think it's a good deal and I am very pleased that Anet are looking at optional subs. I've been speaking about this in my stream for ages.
---
No, it would specifically be BLC because the stuff inside them comes from the gemstore, I think it was an EA sports game im thinking of that did it this route, the packs you could buy with irl money became unavailable even through gameplay, something like that. But it's seemingly irrelevant because Belgians can still get keys from the 1 or 2 sources in game.

---
(M)Human Revenant  
---
(M)Charr Warrior  
---
(M)Asura Elementalist

doesnt take new Life Attunment into consideration for boon uptime
---
Speallbreaker is not supposed to be a dps, but a support boonstrip spec
---
&gt;I think this is extremely petty and hurts the validity of any complaints about truly abusive and manipulative market practices when people are getting equally worked up about something so minor.
---
The thing is, it's the *same issue*. If you allow yourself to exempt examples of manipulative practice on the grounds that they're on a smaller scale, you open the door to valid counter-criticism and accusations of hypocrisy, along with the same slippery slope which led to the issue in the first place. A stance has to be taken as to what should and should not be permitted.
---
Those who are getting worked up are doing so because they have taken the stance that lootboxes are a form of gambling and should not be permissible in unregulated markets. At that point, the perceived value of any individual lootbox in any particular game is irrelevant - it still falls under the same blanket.
---
If you say "look here, this lootbox is bad because it's clearly manipulative, but this other lootbox over here is sort of okay because it's cheap and in a bundle", you're allowing subjectivity to dictate gambling laws, and handing the power back over to the producers and letting them decide what *they* think is permissible.
---
If you look closely, you're also seeing the necromancer sucking out his life force

I've optimized my car by removing the airbags, seatbelts, paneling, ac, and windows.

Kept the mirrors and wipers to keep it street legal, though.
---
Yes, I guess it's similar to what he's asking, but the closest we can get is with account bound currencies.
---
This was a year after the game went life though
---
Looks a bit like Wildstar art style.
---
Not in the bad way, just similar.
---
I would love to have one as mail carrier
---
The map wasn't great but please, the fight against Joko, the cinematics and the roller beetle were incredible
---
Probably just the human or any other mob death animation added to the children cause it would throw errors up or make people crash or other issues if there isn't a animation set.
---
Or even if the npcs die for weird circumstances.
---
So just add it.
---
Is there any sense to turn it into hybrid of power+condi? Griever mixed with berserker and viper?
---
RIT. BELONGS. ON. NECRO.
---
Free stuff!
---
All it EVER should have been was a speed boost. Giving it any combat abilities was a huge mistake in the first place.
---
Mechanically, how would it differ from renegade?
---
perhaps but it's a different issue that requires a different solution
---
So if someone asks you for an optimal necromancer build, would you just say there are none, make a deadeye?
---
that sucks
---
Last 2 seconds: *How the fck do I stop the recording!!!* :D

Using  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OudscwkX1-8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OudscwkX1-8) as the reference.
---
Even if you consider managing 10% for Havoc Specialist instead of 15% the 5% loss makes the build still neutral or still a very slight buff. The previous benchmark being 34,000; the current 34,400. A 5% loss of 34400 is still 32,680 and only considers a 2 empty bar while reserving 1 bar for emergencies.
---
&gt; I'm waiting for a big discount for PoF
---
https://www.nuuvem.com/item/guild-wars-2-path-fire
---
It's already on sale for the lowest price you're going to see for at least several years.
---
&gt; They are birthday gifts.
---
There is no "they". We're discussing one specific item.
---
Naw son.
---
It is all bout keeping berzerk up.
---
Devs focused around that, not making you a sustainable class.
---
The whole point is to make this a high damage and very weak class otherwise.
---
hehe, that was fun. I don't think they dropped anything of interest, just generic mob stuff.
---
Was when they released a new rune... perplexity? maybe? Something that had a set bonus to confuse on interrupt.
---
support necro is optimal carry potential
---
power reaper is optimal edge lord
---
Random question, but how do i see what color dyes i just unlock? I unlock several earlier today, but didn't pay attention to their name, just that i haven't unlocked them yet.
---
Thank The Five. I used some and now I'm down to about 820.
---
That's because it's the only place.
---
Yup. I was sometimes even losing both of them for some reason.
---
I don't run non-cm group and I'm too scared to predict what people are going to do there, tbh. I don't think diviner is going to be enough *everywhere*, so if you are only able to do one gearset, go for healing. 
---
But maybe they are going to already run "healing fb". Maybe they are going to run away from your cats and tablet. Who knows. In decent kp cm+t4 pugs diviner renegade is totally enough for every cm boss, except for maybe 2nd boss of 100cm, sometimes.
---
Yeah, it was perplexity which put confusion upon stun on the affected enemy then.
---
Can't wait for the updated builds.
---
I have been playing heal alacrigrade for the past 2 months in t4 fractals pug and i had 0 problem getting in groups , not even once. The build is a lot of fun to play too!
---
If you have the ressource to build it go for it!
---
That's the joke
---
D:
---
I was talking about PvP.
---
That dolphin swim phase always gives me anxiety so i would do 42.
---
They can't even give these away. I wouldn't log in for those. For the daily log in chest I would. But not those.
---
It is. It's the human male animations.
---
yeah one build is all i can do. ill mostly run with a friend who changes DH to Power FB so i should be fine.
---
ty for your help
---
Nah, i would state the most optimal necro build but I'd probably say that there are other classes that would do alot better
---
i asked for it, stop saying nobody! power berserker feels so good to play again in pvp!
---
I get that part, and its a very good idea, but its not done all that well considering that for being such a high damage class (supposedly), its damage is not nearly as high as other classes. Either berserker needs to get more damage to counter the loss of damage without berserk or berserk needs to be more accessible. Just to put it into perspective, the newest benchmark for the class was around 30k. If we assume that a streamlined rotation puts it around 32k, its still worse than other classes even though its designed to be a "high damage, low survivability class". Its a direct downgrade to power dragonhunter which has comparable dps but much higher burst, and the option to use range in instances where range is required. There's very little reason to use berserker for dps as its dps isn't better than any other dps even when all the utilities you take are purely for maintaining berserk uptime, and its impossible to take utilities such as banners because you need physical and rage skills to maintain dps.
---
Ok thank you, hope it's soon then. The random licenses aren't available in my region so I'd have buy several 1000 gems to get a skin for each mount. This bundle would be sweet.
---
iirc they are highlighted in the dye panel until first use/loading screen
---
Can you post a video with the 31.5k benchmark? Would love this spec to be better then what I could achieve :(
---
Although it would be sad not using gs - F1 feels amazing and axe camping is boring af
---
Because support confirming  the bug linked above doesnt matter. Kiroho knows it all.

Fun isn’t something one considers when completing the world map. But this… does put a smile on my face.
---
Daredevil is mostly 3-5 targets... just sayin'
---
Chinese have even worse regulation. Their authorities thus far turn a blind eye to the "crafty" ways (they are pretty obvious really) of avoiding the law but it won't last forever.
---
It takes about 3-4 shots to dismount a player with a power build. So a "small zerg" or even a little roaming group can easily kill him. 
---
Oh wait, maybe people should stop b\*tching about ranged classes and realize that they are useful for such things.

The fact that other games overprice their microtransactions doesn't invalidate the fact that GW2 microtransactions are overpriced.
---
Why would Rangers not be welcomed?  I did my first bout of WvW on my Revenant yesterday and felt pretty useless vs zergs and figured my Sic'em sniper Soulbeast would be way better..?  
---
And while it was pretty fun I had a hard time figuring out what was the "point".. at the end of the night I checked the vendors to see what I could use all these new currencies on and nothing really interested me.

Good thing I play soulbeast now.

Manda pm para IntrépidoColosso.8549 que te explico tudo o que vc quiser saber. Tem inclusive guildas BR que jogam wvw regularmente. Vou estar on hoje a noite a partir das 20 horas
---
Please just delete banners from the game so you can stop constantly inventing new ways to eat up our utility slots and we get our functional base class back.
---
This, over the past 2-3 years, everything of value that could be obtained through gameplay without the gemstore had been devalued significantly. Exotics, t6 mats, ascended mats, rare gear, and ectos are a fraction of what they once could garner you on the TP. This would tank dyes due to the lack of demand.
---
Power shatter is not better in any way with this patch, as the main burst comes from shattering 3 clones on F1 - something you can't do if you F3 right before.
---
How do I combine skimmer pup minis in the mystic forge? I've got 3 blue ones and 2 unidentified dyes but can't click forge when I put them in.
---
What did you play on rev? If it's not power hammer herald then I don't blame you for feeling useless. 
---
Rangers are either focused on single target, projectile based ranged damage or melee damage with low mobility. None of those are useful in large scale fights. Its support capabilities are also not even close to ones of more popular supports.
---
Anything RNG related is blocked for Gems in Belgium.
---
They are below competition as much as they can afford, are they overpriced, how do you measure?
---

critical strikes -&gt; bottom grandmaster trait

also the new adept trait on daredevil (top) and "mug" from adept deadly arts help a lot

btw, there are no forged in HoT
---
I'm not on EU or in a restricted purchase area, but yah it's definitely not ideal.
---
Ah, scaling changes from toughness to vitality actually explain a lot why condi fell out of meta from fractals. Thanks!
---
Btw, any of the currently desired classes actively use staff for fractals / openworld ? I kinda remembered i completed Nevermore just before i quit, it would be a waste not to use it.
---
Most people only care about WvW and PvP anyways.
---
So, really,.....
---
And you are? Mr. pissed off?
---
Nobody denied any bugs, so what's your problem? 
---
I just said that OP is exaggerating, when he says that all instruments are broken (because they aren't). 
---
Things are not black or white, good or bad, broken or unbroken. If you don't understand that, learn it and stop your feign rage mode Mr. pissed off. 
---
Thanks and good bye.
---
Tbh you appear as pissed off with that post :)
---
They look so young man
---
Woops
---
But I like the kind of lootboxes Anet give us...
---
&gt; popular argument of "don't like it, don't buy it"
---
this argument should go like "cant afford it do not wary about buying it" as a more correct version. maybe someone likes it, wants it, and not being able to get it frustrates them and then they are hit with short version "don't like it, don't buy it" which might make you think people who use it lack foresight, but they don't.
---
Just saw the other post here about Belgium... That sucks man... I've never gifted anything before, but maybe someone can gift you the rng-stuff you want.
---
Nah it's okay, you'll soon learn what it means if you keep being such a cunt on the subreddit :+)
---
It's part of the model of not having a subscription by default, the game needs to continue to generate revenue to exist lol.
---
Subscription based monetization is all but dead with few exceptions. It may be optional in some games with lots of perks, but it's bad for business these days to lock your entire game behind a sub.
---
Oh i just saw that now, but is it safe to buy this way? And what is difference btw that and buying on official site? I mean its the first time that i want to buy any game so i dont really have experience.
---
Uuuuu I like internet threats
---
Daredevil, check metabattle.com for builds for any gamemodes
---
By calling facts and mentioning that OP is exaggerating? 
---
I don't think so. 
---
I think you read my comment less neutral than it is.
---
You said they are working as intended while support confirmed a bug. You are the obe denying facts.
---
It’s already confirmed that they don’t work as intended. You and Music guilds won’t notice it as much cause you are not able to play as fast as a macro. Something got changed in the speed of instruments which results that all song people made over the years are broken
---
It’s because at the time, warrior has no way the play a viable condition build. Berserker was intended to allow warriors to have the option to take that kind of play style.
---
150 condi damage is not worth losing the expertise conversion from vitality, the additional poison every 5 seconds and the poison modifier and extra poison on beast skill usage.
---
By claiming something works as intended you deny the existence of the bug. The bug is confirmed by Anet themselves, which means instruments are not working as intended. Even if it's not 100% occurance, it's still not working as intended.
---
Because it's meta for a long time now. Rene+Qbrand outclasses druid/chrono by far. And if you need skips/portals, Weaver with blinks and Xera portals are usually sufficient.
---
Definitely. In a perfect world IMO, berserker would be a toggleable ability that might give you like a stacking degen where rage skulls might decrease the stacks. Considering that the damage is just okay, berserk needs to be more easily attainable.

Was so glad to see these. Been making a bunch of new characters and have been switching around gear, so I completely burned through all my Transmutation charges. Its been hard getting them back, so these are more than welcome.

Thanks, I thought PoF but wrote HoT. I'll check those out
---
&gt;mount with skills and gimmicks is 
---
Mount without skills and "gimmicks", is pretty much useless speed buff.   No thanks.
---
Pretty sure that warr mains are tired of being BS and would play anything that has some new and shiny animations.
---
I already know that. Actually I have some macros myself that I can't use anymore. 
---
But I never denied any bugs, there is a bug that makes macros useless, but that doesn't mean instruments are broken. That's all I said, because OP pretended that instruments are broken like "you can't do anything with them" since that one update.
---
&gt; By claiming something works as intended you deny the existence of the bug.
---
&gt;Did you know there is a bug with Rangers longbow 4? Guess what, and yet it works as intended.

Learn. To. Read...
---
It's not that hard, son.
---
I know I don't buy dyes in GW2 and I haven't even opened a single Black Lion Chest despite having a bunch of keys. I've found a few dyes that I liked among the ones I've unlocked that work well together. I'm sure that as I get more dyes over time, the set I use will change, but I'm pretty happy with the ones I have now.
---
Dyes are something I kind of view as having pluses and minuses in GW2. The plus being that once you get a dye, you don't have to buy it and it's available account-wide. The downside is that you can't target specific dyes. I'm used to FFXIV where you buy (or craft) a dye and use it, then it's gone.
---
I'm sure I'll eventually end up opening the Black Lion chests, but I'll probably wait a bit longer still.
---
Hmm...
---
Human pairs well with Guardian and Mesmer.
---
Charr look awesome as Necromancers and Engineers.

Asura look great as Engineers and Elementalists.

While the idea for using rage skills to extend berserk mode is great in concept, in the current balance state it doesn't seem to be worth it, at least for power. 
---
As of this morning I believe this is the highest rotation posted so far for power at 32.5k, and it does nothing to try to extend berserk mode. 
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoMV-2g0Gp0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoMV-2g0Gp0)
---
It's one of the easier rotations so on weaver, Engi etc he would have dealt less. So the player is just .. meh. Can't do anything about that. Also Gorse is one of the only bosses that is an actual dps check. On most other bosses dps is never the problem
---
Honey, no. You f3 before you pump out shatter fodder, while your mirror blade bounces after a blink during burst sequence. This way you only use F3 with 0 clones, and then have shatter fodder to execute the F1.   
---
Power mesmer is still weak because relying on one stun to 100-0 someone these days is like relying on stellar cosmic event for timekeeping.

I mean if your bags are filling up completely I guess that could happen.  Or do you keep your weapons at the top of your bag like some kind of weirdo?
---
I’m gonna get chased forever while doing dailies...
---
Not salty about scepter nerf at all. Salty that they made chronophantasma trash because apparently mesmer can't have a normal bruiser build, though. Again, kneejerk move that made a lot of chrono builds you could do worse while the problem - chronobunker - found a way through their overbuff of scepter power coefficient. Also, sword is overnerfed to bits too.
---
priceless!
---
What's the alternative?
---
If he had played any other class he probably would have looked into the rotation in the first place. I don't have a problem with reapers. It's usually the "reaper main" that's the problem. Sure, I've seen bad dhs, bad deadeyes but rarely has a reaper pug surprised me in a positive way.
---
so just by paying a "little bit more" makes me get things for free. ok.  
---
nice logic there.  
---
the worth of a statuette is not set in stone btw. you could get 10 transmutation charges...which are easy to come by ig and not even worth buying. you could get some minipets which are worth 1g15s right now....which would make it basically worthless.  
---
or you have to gamble even more to get more statues if you want some item which costs like 60 statuettes. so basically a initative for you to start gambleing.
---
a dye is not worth more then 50 gems, if you get a shit dye for 1 silver...here you can already see, that it is a gamble.  
---
arguing with insults? i mean its pretty obvious that you can't grasp that concept why this is a gamble / incentive to start it and bad practice (for customers) overall.
---
Yeah, I feel you
---
or...buy gem cards cheaper elsewhere.
---
&gt;gambling regulation laws are garbage
---
would you kindly throw yourself off a cliff
---
It still delays the whole burst sequence slightly, especially if you compare it to the times we had stun on mantra. If you pre-stun in any way, that makes it super easy to dodge (considering the enemy has a stun break aka everyone).
---
Nerfing stun on mantra killed the build for any serious top level gameplay (not like it was widely used before anyway).
---
I think grinding on children is a whole different crime.
---
Eir died for this
---
if $30 is a "whale" to you, perhaps get a job that pays more than minimum wage.
---
Have a friend that is like that. Maybe it's a curse xD. I often play PReaper but never in a lazy way like those mains
---
The unblockable is completely irrelevant text. Like straight up, does nothing. Its only ever relevant against channeled blocks, and why would you ever want to steal through channeled blocks? In essence, this change wasnt a downside for an upside. It was halved range for no benefit.
---
&gt; the worth of a statuette is not set in stone btw.
---
It's between 35 an 125 gems per statuette according to this post. https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bgu439/skritt_math_for_war_eternal_supply_drop_its_a/

Well she can't until next week. So far you can only get 2 skins of the set through the weekly supply drop package. They will officially release on the gemstore next week.

I love gw1 ritualists and gw2 deadeye, thematic-wise.
---
they pussy
---
&gt;when he says that all instruments are broken
---
I never said that.
---
A decade ago was a different age and a different mindset that the common gamer had towards monetization of games. This has changed over time. Subscriptions might have worked then, and like I had inferred with ***few exceptions*** some may still work now, but this is not a feasible or sustainable market practice ***right now***.
---
I played Asheron's Call for years, but that doesn't mean that model is going to work now. Time's change and so do the expectations of the general market.
---
Oh so they cannot buy Unidentified Dyes with Gold on the TP?
---
You either love or hate deadeye. I feel like many people have no motivation to play a sniper in an rpg where there are warriors and wizards. But it does have a great theme and feel to it!
---
Impressive
---
Your functional base class...that included banners.....okay.
---
&gt;You can do everything with instruments you could do before that one patch, therefore instruments still work as intended.
---
Being able to do something doesn't mean it's working as intended.  
---
The added delay made things more difficult to play properly. The change made in the November patch ruined macro's as a whole. Definite loss to the musicians in Kryta if you ask me.
---
I got that but now unsure about my mount decisions. was standing with a guild mate and compared our mount skins. it cost me a full evening to colour them still not satisfied. didn't expect that comming.
---
DE has easier time to get accepted I think. GW1 was fully fantastic world, but gw2 is moving towards steampunk, with more and more relevance of technology. It goes both for asuran magitech and charr industrial steam machines.
---
They could fix that by making self-induced CC ignored by stability.
---
That would also include the Engineer rifle.
---
Or they could make Outrage deal damage, and make the extra duration based on hitting, not on breaking stun, and instead make the damage greater when breaking stun.
---
Yo, how's that boot tasting?
---
Yes, I'm aware that people are far more accepting of viciously predatory monetization these days. Apparently so much so that it's not even worth speaking out against here. Yikes.
---
You have the option to say "no" when asked. Try it next time.
---
Charr - Druid toooo OMG
---
Invisible bag in the last bag slot, store all weapons/extra armour sets there. Never fills up unless all the other slots above are for some reason full.
---
Pretty sure you do, considering ideal circumstances that allow permanent berserk barely let you scratch 30k.
---
The whole post and comments on it is full of guidance how to do it.
---
No, you are too cheap
---
&gt; As a result, druids are now significantly worse off offensively in all game modes [...]
---
&gt; What are your thoughts?
---
Why should the druid be good offensively ?
---
You implied that having played a subscription game would shift the perspective of the conversation completely ignoring the context of change over time. 
---
Subscription games having existed previously doesn't change that there are more important details to observe when considering whether they are still sustainable.
---
You can have a dissenting opinion all you want, it doesn't mean your reasoning makes sense.
---
I think the pet nerf makes sense in raids/fractals/pvp, but that’s about it.  
---
Open world was already to the “why bother” point for playing Druid, but now on top of that you do even less to the HP sponges known as world bosses/metas.  Guess I’ll just continue to use tempest in open world stuff. :(
---
WvW is the only one I’m clueless on if it was a good or bad change.
---
you mean most clunky,lowest dps class with 0 teleports/invis and 80% skills missing targets if they moving? now thats god like indeed XD
---
it's better on every raid with mechanics that require you to move out of melee for any significant time
---
Tbh? The Charr race is the only reason why this takes so long. All other races have pretty much the same body structure just with different scales. But the hunched walk plus tail on the charr, complicates it A LOT.
---
It's almost like upright walking charrs would have solved that issue almost completely. As the community requested when GW2 was announced.
---
By the way. Charr and Tengu bodystructure is not that far away from each other. Depending on the tools Arena nets Devs have to their disposal, it should not be that difficult to adjust an armor set to a Tengu character model.
---
And we will stay there until they remove them
---
yea i have accounts on NA, i originally played there for a few years before i moved to EU. I know a lot of other skips too just decided not to put them in, i learned most of them myself

&gt; the soul eater trait is useless because you can't cap crit at all with it at base form. base form full glass cannon berserker stats you have only 50% crit chance 
---
First off, with raid buffs, base form necros with full Berserker/Scholar has 84.5% crit chance, 91.5% with Sigil of Accuracy.
---
Secondly, the change is likely made to give Reapers the ability to choose between min-maxing critical chance, or getting more sustain. After the change, I would probably recommend Soul Eater for open world, and Decimating Defense for group content. Having more meaningful choices is always nice.
---
I just dont get it from a PvP perspective.
---
Pets were nerfed multiple times, particularly Smokescale/Bristleback because people disliked them being so strong while a Druid was so durable and self-sustaining.
---
Then Druid itself got hammered multiple times with Staff damage nerfs, multiple healing nerfs, a nerf to Verdant Etching, and Celestial Avatar increases from 10, to 15, then to 20s. 
---
Now this happens. 
---
So, can we see those pet damage reversions now that Druid will be weak at self-sustaining AND dealing damage? What about a staff rework? Why not make Verdant Etching cleanse 2 conditions so that taking Glyphs seem like a feasible idea again?
---
You can't gift that item.
---
Just delete warrior from the game then you don't have to play it Pog

I also posted about this a while ago (3 months) while I haven't tired them at all since then.

Keep in mind your Gorse numbers are going to be “low” because if the phasing. If you save your arc logs and use a parse website you can see your spikes compared to others. 
---
I don’t play DH so I don’t have specific tips but using a parse for raid encounters are a great way to compare yourself to others. Plus you can see your boons which will greatly change your numbers.
---
Yup, sounds like me! Where can I sign up? I mean... I will be a god afterwards. And yes, I deserve this.
---

---
Well, current DPS on banner builds is good enough to not yet warrant "just drop banner+low dps and add regular high dps player". But it's creeping closer in that direction. And in pugland a good banner is, like, 3rd DPS. Soooo... we can live with it for now.
---
Clunky rotations is the new thing for Anet though, it's saaad :(
---
if nothing else works paint them black ;)
---
Yea but then he’ll get kicked and theyll look for another warrior to fill the banner slave role
---
If you're joining trashy groups, you get trashy responses. There's nothing surprising about it.
---
Condi zerk was one of the highest dps specs in numerous encounters; unless of course you sucked at it.
---
I have a full asc set of Minstrels/Monk armor from my WvW guard. Naturally, the dmg is abyssmal with it. But does it matter that much?
---
I have another full set but converting it to Harrier and then back to Diviner's seems expensive...
---
You could do this with costume brawl skills, Get players who never cleanse to keep fighting you and stacking confusion on themselves.
---
I PLAY COSTUME BRAWL FOR KEEPS, MAN
---
Lmao, kids.
---
So, once you check if there's an issue with your rotation you should look at your positioning and buffs. Doing burst during break or spinning your GS exactly inside the hitbox make huge difference.
---
No. But then again I didn't ask whether VPNs are OK? What about "it's fine if you drive to France to make a purchase"?  
---
There's also the second question.
---
That looks like the GW2 client itself having issue connecting to the servers unless launchbuddy messing things up with one of the commandline arguments.
---
Surely that npc hasn’t been killed in... forever, why the low bonus Xp?
---
Can't use "F" skills that come with gyros underwater.
---
I say 32k dps is ok. Scratching 30k is not.
---
oh yes, setting yourself ablaze would fit perfecly thematic - even though that might seem similar to the holoforge
---
They're definitely a bit on the pricey side by modern loot box standards, although this is somewhat offset by the fact that they're fairly easy to grind for, by MMO standards at any rate. I'd personally like to see them brought more in line with what I would grudgingly call the industry standard, both in terms of price and how they function (that is, moving from a key-and-box system to a single-purchase model), but I doubt that's a particularly high priority for ANet at the moment, and might hurt their profits too much for them to justify.
---
No real difference on your end, and as long as you use one of the websites that are listed by ArenaNet (check the link I attached) then it is perfectly safe. That being said, if it isn't listed, I would be careful buying from them.
---
Engi and Necro are both doing pretty hot in PvP and WvW right now. Population for PvP has always been meh as Anet hasn't changed much since you've left. WvW is heavily dependent on what server you're on.   
---
Outside of PvP and WvW there's tons of stuff to do now. Anet has been trying to balance out the reward spread such that there isn't one obviously best farms, which means other content will actually get players now. World Bosses still always full, HoT map metas are more popular than ever. Only things that are deserted are the PoF maps.
---
I hope changes towards power Warrior will get it back into "speedkill meta" --&gt; no confusion towards pugs
---
While a lot of players are expressing moral outrage over loot boxes, the Belgian gambling regulations are not rooted in moral outrage.  You can tell when a law reflects a moral stand against gambling when its essence is 'gambling is illegal in Belgium'.  That is not what is going on here, as gambling is clearly legal, just regulated.
---
Regulations serve two purposes.  First, they provide consumer protections against predatory or fraudulent business behavior.  Second, they serve as a barrier to entry, protecting incumbents from competition.  The former is generally good, the latter generally bad.
---
While there are elements of both in all regulations, you can distinguish the primary purpose by their implementation.  Clear requirements and organizations streamlined to minimize the cost of compliance show focus on consumer protection.  Opaque or cumbersome requirements and intransigent organizations reflect a real purpose of protecting incumbents from competition.
---
I agree 100% that loot boxes and similar products need prohibitions against the predatory elements of that business.  However given the details I am deeply skeptical that this is the purpose of the Belgian ruling.  There is a real need to examine the issues around loot boxes, and the Belgian rule isn't helping with that at all.
---
Dude confusion was so sick back then. I remember screwing people up in Wvw using an engineer, just pull them towards you and smack em with some confusion and watch them instinctively dodge roll away, attack and panic and they suddenly start dying really quick.

Has anyone tested out the new Berserker yet? Should I switch from my condi build or stay on it?
---
Well i saw one 50% sale on Nuuvem but its not available in my country so i think i will just wait for another sale on official site or just buy game with original price.
---
I do miss the old Obsidian Sanctum.. fighting each other. First to the top. Ugh. Delicious.
---
I agree with this but I also feel like a mediocre fb+renegade duo with one of them being a healer gives a smoother run than a mediocre chrono+druid. Maybe it's just my experience.
---
Hey there! So, I was thinking of picking my old Druid back up as I really started liking it again, but since I hated it once, I only have zerker gear on it.  
---
I was also wondering how would I go about gearing my character for Raids/FoTM since I'm mid-way through gearing my DH, so any suggestions about that could come in handy.  
---
Cheers!
---
It might be difficult to channel human god forms now that the human gods left Tyria. Also, Joko forbid worshiping the old human gods. In Joko's kingdom, we only found hidden sects of people worshiping Kormir. It would be too difficult to channel a god form in Joko's kingdom, and if a dervish was powerful enough to do so they would be killed and converted into Joko's minion (like High Priestess Amala). There are some dervishes in modern Istan, but they don't seem to practice any god magic.

The command line is empty, if I start GW2 via Launchbuddy. Starting via GW2 launcher shows the normal path ülus arguments.

---
only 100 for onyx and branded qeapon boxes is stupid
---
There are some different elements of loot boxes that need to be unpacked.
---
Some items are only available via loot boxes, but the whole contents of those boxes are then free to be traded - like the dye packs.  There's actually extra value created by bundling these - A.Net gets to average their prices and sales over the bundle, and players can use market prices to allocate them more efficiently.  There are a lot of gains here and it's hardly exploitative.
---
Then there is stuff that is account bound in a loot box, but also available to be bought directly.  These loot boxes are sorts of 'grab bag' of stuff, where you get a lot at a deep discount instead of picking individually.  There are some elements of gambling here and it could be predatory, but these also tend to be win-win: players that just want to spend a lot of money on stuff can get a lot of additional value, and A.Net sells more.  I tend to think this is ok as well; even though it may appeal to compulsive gamblers it is not structured to exploit those tendencies.
---
Then you have stuff that can only come from loot boxes and cannot be traded, like the black lion exclusives.  This sort of box item is *clearly* predatory and makes money off our worst impulses.  The black lion statuette workaround on that doesn't fully counterbalance it and is at best a dark gray area.  This sort of loot box would clearly be banned by a reasonable set of consumer protections.
---
This is where smart regulations would be immensely valuable.  Companies do need to fund their games and randomness is a valuable tool for doing so, but predatory usage of it ruins it wholesale.  Unpacking it and establishing clear practices would be best for everyone.
---

Sw battlefront 2 seems to do very well. i play the game almost daily and it's a great game and has a good playerbase.  EA on the other hand has a very bad reputation for milking players and lost many players because of it.
---
Well if a company mostly focus on gemstore the game just gets less interesting for other players. I also know many people who stopped playing just the way they were heading with it.  Lootboxes has made the gaming industry lazy and bad. Much companies prever to focus on lootboxes or other gambling ways instead of content. Even much more games release unfinished.

Asking around and "selling" per message (you send the item, the other sends the gold)
---
Wouldn't recommend it tho. There is no safe message trading like in WoW, so you can't be sure to get your gold. Even worse if the gold comes via real money trading it could lead to accountsanctions (banning) on your side.

Netherlands followed, investigations are ongoing in multiple countries, USA included.
---
This was what BE wanted to achieve, not a full solution from the get go (you never get it right the first time), but breaking it open so it would be investigated further.
---
So, here's my take on the Master of Manipulation change: while the Reflect effect was nice on paper, practically speaking it didn't really mesh with the skills in question. The only skill that it had any sort of synergy with was Arcane Thievery, with all the others either being too valuable to burn for the Reflect, already offering defensive effects that render the Reflect pointless, or they just give the effect without the Trait anyway, and at that point you might as well run Feedback.
---
Superspeed, on the other hand, has interesting synergies with most of the Manipulation skills, particularly when applied to all targeted allies in addition to the user. It's still a nice bonus to have on Arcane Thievery, but it also enhances the mobility of Blink, gives anyone affected by Illusion of Life more mobility during their window of opportunity, and is a nice addition to the newly-buffed Mass Invisibility (and it's in the same Trait line as Prismatic Understanding, meaning you can have a full 9 seconds of Stealth every 48 seconds before Alacrity, plus the Superspeed, which could be very interesting in PvP or WvW as well as some parts of PvE). It also isn't redundant with the effect of Mirror, which is a solid improvement.
---
I think it's worse than sb/sb in every real raid scenario except sabetha
---
The item in question is currently selling on the TP for 2800g and buying at 2100g
---
Recently, I started playing Warframe, and 90% of their cash shop stuff is the *opposite* of lootboxes. Meaning, you can play the game and get RNG drops for things like weapons, warframes, whatever, OR you can go to the cash shop and just buy the thing you want without having to wait for RNG to bless you. Everything else is stuff like hats &amp; capes &amp; outfits, and, again, NONE of that is RNG. You buy a cape, you get a cape. It's not so much pay to win as it is "pay to go a bit faster and look fancy."

Oh back in that area.  Didn't even know it was there.  I know a festival NPC is back there but not that.
---
you should have checked the items he did the math against, which where exactly 3. of which one was transmutation charges which i mentioned before, the other one being a revive orb...i bet they are the most sold item on the store LOL, and the last one being a heroic booster which is the only useful item for some. i wouldn't spend those statuettes on either of those.  
---
a dye pack is a gamble box. check this one just as example:  
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Frost_Dye_Kit

now ask yourself: how many gems would you spend on it.
---
In pug groups previous builds were on average 12k DPS. If new rotation are clunky enough to have pugs go back to 10 DPS is it still worth it?

The only thing that saves deadeye for being totally uninterested is that they use magic on their attacks. Not only in their cantrips and marks, their rifle shots also seem to be magic-related, even if they shoot actual bullets.

I'm a simple man, when I see Belgians complaining about gem store items being locked I upvote

You are an adult. This game contains children.

I'd be fine with a law saying nothing more than games with lootboxes are treated as gambling, and must follow gambling laws, including having a duty to ensure their players are adults.
---
Who ever went druid for personal DPS? On almost any encounter, they are barely a blip on arcdps. They could reduce pet damage by 300% and make them heal enemies and youd barely notice a change in druid dps since its so ridiculously low in general.

And to what end was such a nerf deserved in PvP when Druid isnt even relevant in any sense? It hasnt been a viable node-sitter or a support since the end of HoT/early PoF. The changes dont do it any significant favors vs other supports either.

ISP messing with web traffic wouldn't actually be all that surprising although something that corrupts data would also be very noticeable
---
GW2 is all about active defenses, kill the thing faster than it can kill you while dodging/blocking shit. Essentially gitgud. Assassin pieces are commonly used together with zerk pieces, but only for the sole purpose for getting 100% crit chance. No amount of vitality/toughness can save you, since it doesnt offer much and on the downside you have less dps.
---
Honestly, gw2exchange carries virtually no risk if you use a middleman (Costs 2% I believe) and if your buyer has a good reputation there, it’s a very small risk.
---
recreating my accounts helped, thank you. :D
---
&gt; We do not suspend users for one, single, offhand "fuck off". If we did, the PvP landscape would be utterly deserted. For a suspension, a user needs to either spam that; they need to use MUCH stronger language; or they do something else that breaks these rules - and get reported for it.
---
To follow up on this:
---
I can understand that a bit more slack is given in pvp environments regarding verbal abuse. But in a case where no infraction/suspension is given because the verbal abuse wasnt too toxic, are warnings being given out? 
---
I think warnings may go a long way in making offenders aware of their offense, for example:
---
"You have been reported for verbal abuse in a pvp environment. While we determined that your offense wasnt big enough to warrant a temporary suspension, please review your conduct in the future."
---
Since you have full Exotic Berserker's stats, you might as well go Power Soulbeast on your Ranger.  
---
As for Dragonhunter, I'll find the link for a gearing guide give me a bit.
---
I love how Guild Wars 2 Necromancer's aren't evil by default.
---
There are some really interesting conversations with the Necro NPCs that cover how they view death as a natural part of life. Regardless of race and culture.
---
Without having lfg be part of the API, I don't believe it is possible to do so
---
As if proper tanking/aoe positioning was difficult lol. Rip sb once the tank has to move or the boss turns around to attack.
---
There is something to play outside of pve, you know.
---
Just getting back into the game after a few months break. I'm trying to get the new Warclaw mount. The last time I played WvW was probably in 2013 or 2014 (of what I did play, I wasn't even max level and was doing it purely to explore that area of the game, so I didn't know much about it then), so I basically have no idea what I'm doing. What's the point of the four different zones? Where are the largest amount of people usually at? I'm cycling through the zones and I can't for the life of me find any friendlies that I'd be able to follow around until we captured a keep.
---
With regards to aesthetic I think elementalist artwork I see is the best even though necromancer is my favourite profession to play where they unfortunately use an asura as default artwork.
---
Assassin won't help you survive, it has no defensive stats either.  Sometimes, as mentioned in another reply already, some Assassin pieces will supplement Berserker to ensure maximum crit chance.  But the main thinking behind the offensive stats is that your character's block and evasion skills, plus your two dodge rolls, are all just as effective when you have no defensive stats as when you have all defensive stats, so depend on those to survive and depend on your offensive stats to slaughter enemies quickly enough that you don't run out of defenses.
---
There are situations against certain elites or champions where you will run out of defenses before you can kill them.  That's where group play comes in, or where you keep a ranged weapon in your off-hand slot to kite and buy time.
---
Few things I would like to point out from the calculation
---
**Week 1**
---
- The dye pack contains 5 different dye kits, each of them is usually sold for 125 gems for 1 or 500 gems for 5. However, that price is only worth when new dyes first come out and the prices of the exclusives are high (~100g). In this bundle, 4 out of the 5 dye kits have appeared in black lion chest recently, causing the exclusive dyes to crash in price (to 10-20g). As a result, it's very hard to put an accurate price around it, maybe 200-300 gem would be fair
---
- Mount miniature set has 5 different minis which are all around 1g each (they are black lion chest guaranteed drops from the past), so that section is just about 5g
---
**Week 2**
---
- Onyx and golden weapon only appears in 2000 gem bundles (usually contains an outfit, a glider/backpack and some other consumable items). It's similar to immortal weapon from couple years ago, and those are available for 150 statuettes. That price is way too expensive though and I don't think anyone would purchase. A more fair estimate would be a standalone gem store weapon skin, probably 500-800 gems.
---
- miniature claim ticket is really useless. Most of the time 1 ticket you can only buy a blue/green mini, and the value of the ticket is around 1-2g each only. However, during some periods of the year (festivals mainly), you can use the ticket to exchange gemstore minis, and the rate varies a lot. Best deals are like 1 ticket for a 350 gem mini, and worst deals are like 5 or even 10 ticket for a 400 gem mini. Overall it's definitely not worth much. I'd put it at maybe 100-150 gem per ticket as best. 
---
** Week 3**
---
- black lion statuette is an interesting item, most people don't use it to buy transmutation charge or revive orb or boosters, but instead save enough to buy a gemstore skin. Some properly choice are
---
- 15 for a guarantee wardrobe unlock (~100g value)
---
- 60 for a black lion chest exclusive drop (~25 key value, 2100 gems)
---
- 30 for an outfit (700 gems)
---
- 25 for a gemstore weapon skin (600 gems)
---
Roughly you can value it as 25-30 gems each
---
- Bonfire / heroic boosters feel pretty weak in terms of value, and I doubt anyone buys them at their gemstore price, but since they are sold separately at such price I'll refrain from commenting
---
**Week 4**
---
- black lion keys were never that cheap, the anniversary sale was 1470 for 25, at 30% off. So that would be 294 gems for 5.
---
- branded weapon select box is likely the next black lion ticket set, which is usually around 50g when first released. (50g = ~150-200 gems)
---
- I would put guarantee wardrobe unlock at about 300-400 gems (to accounts which unlocked all the cheap skins already, see the section above for statuettes)
---
Ah ... that issue. It is because -shareArchive prevents the client from updating the dat files. I am going to skip the other stuff that can be said about that but maybe try https://github.com/Healix/Gw2Launcher instead? I mentions dealing with these other issues.
---
Is there a way to get that staff?
---
I play warrior in fractals, and I couldnt get banners to spawn at all in the daily Aquatic Ruins.
---
Other than constantly fucking things up in Tyria, what have the Gods actually done? I hope Aurene eats them all.
---
But those summaries of runs contain my data, if I was a part of it. I still don't like that.
---
&gt; i hate being 1 shotted by a random elite mob (when im out of dodges)
---
No one is *forcing* you to use berserker/viper gear in open world. You can take soldiers/knights/trailblazer if you want, just expect fights to take twice as long. If it's happening in fractals, dungeons or raids, well, everyone else manages perfectly fine, maybe it's time to stop blaming gear.
---
In Raids with toughness tanking mechanics, having toughness is bad because you could end taking aggro away from your group's dedicated tank. Other than that, you can run the stats you want.
---
However, keep in mind that most builds recommend either full Berserker (sometimes a mix with Assassins) or full Vipers because that results in the highest DPS for the build. Every now and then you come across a Grieving build for hybrid Condi/Power damage, and in WvW you need more survivability so you'll see Marauders or even Celestial.
---
The expansions go on sale several times a year. I believe the highest discount is 50% off, so feel free to pull the trigger on anything over 40% off.

Even if Arenanet confirms that they'll suspend trolling players, you should turn the chat off anyway.  There's people who'll troll regardless of the consequences, so if the sanctity of the movie is important to you, don't take chances.

My point was it was already bad and it was made worse in that mode. Which to me is silly.  I’m sorry that my descriptions came off as “whining and crying.”  That was not intentional.  Was fully intending to explain where the change did and did not make sense.
---
I doubt ArenaNet really had much say/knowledge of how things will be handled from KFT's end, so I wouldn't really say fuck ArenaNet for letting them. 
---
Anet was probably aware from the beginning that some aspects of the giveaway would only be able to happen in the US, and KFT probably made a load of promises about how the thing would run and how the info would be presented. 
---
I bet it all looked good from ArenaNet's perspective, and that of their marketers and lawyers, but things fell apart pretty quickly when we all realized just how shitty the KFT web-dev team was when making their app. 
---
Given the state of the app, I wouldn't doubt that the KFT marketing team and those that worked with Anet were just as incompetent.
---
How did you get your code? I made an account but received nothing :/

That's the plan. Now i buy one, the next sale from Anet/sellers (seems one each month or two) I buy the other. Problem is, i don't know which to buy.

Could be a few gold
---
As others have mentioned, there's quite a bit of flexibility in how you can build your character and what classes fill what roles, although this is reduced somewhat in late-game group content like Raids. Looking at Rifle for Warrior specifically, it's a perfectly functional weapon and entirely viable in most content, however it's a bit on the bland side and it has a strong focus on applying Vulnerability to enemies, which is useful when playing solo but largely unnecessary in a group. More broadly speaking DPS Warrior is entirely viable, just not necessarily the absolute best option under every circumstance.
---
If you want a better idea of how builds work in GW2, here's a general rundown of how to put something workable together:
---
1. Find a weapon you like (Rifle, in this case).
---
2. Look through your Traits to find the one that enhances that weapon (for Warrior, that would be Crack Shot in the Discipline specialization) and work towards that.
---
3. Pick other Traits from that same line that fit well with how you like to play and/or how your weapon works.
---
4. Rinse and repeat for your alternate weapons and utility skills, which should leave you with most or all of your Traits filled out.
---
5. If you still have a slot or two open, look for traits that have synergies with what you're already running, or just look interesting if you're at a loss for ideas.
---
This is glossing over the intricacies of stats (hot tip: Rifle is a Power weapon for Warrior, so Power, Precision and Ferocity are the stats you'll want to focus on for increasing your damage output) and picking utilities and such, of course, but it will be enough to get your through most of the game, or at least to a point where you understand the class well enough to figure out the rest for yourself. That said, if you have any questions or want a hand figuring anything out, feel free to drop me a line.

Two tips for Power Dragonhunter:  
---
1. Lining up the burst phase   
---
2. Retaliation up time
---
A big trick for Power Dragonhunter is ensuring your full burst rotation lines up with the Defiance Bar being broken and Exposed is applied on the boss. Between Rune of Impact, Exposed, and your full burst, you should be hitting absolutely monstrous spikes after each break. This will mean using more filler such as GS auto if you expect the Defiance Bar to come up soon.   
---
As for the Retaliation up time, it's pretty self explanatory. You gain a huge dps boost when you have Retaliation. You should be self generating Retaliation as part of your rotation (GS 4, F1), but if you find yourself without Retal and those skills on cooldown, pop your heal skill for another source of Retal. Again, make sure Retaliatinon lines up with your burst.

Tell me something. How hard is open world PvE life?
---
I personally would suggest waiting for a sale to buy both, but if you need to pick 1 right now, I'd get PoF because of mounts.

At least this time it doesnt come bundled with Heroic Accounts for free dailies.
---
You start tunnel bear, then copy the NA link (na.alienwarearena.com etc.).
---
Open it in an incognito window (not sure if this is needed), register. It will send a confirmation to your mail adress, confirm this. Then the page will load and you enter a name, surname, etc. and then enter some state in the US. After that is finished, there will be a popup window with the code. 
---
It worked for me with chrome.
---
US only huh? 
---
Yeah that feels good after playing and supporting the game for almost 7 years. I swear, if this episode is delayed for so because of some stupid US only pr bullshit I am going to be so fucking mad.
---
True, but there's a *small chance* it will be worth more!
---
In terms of DPS builds, you are always going to be choosing between 2 options: Power and Condi Damage. Both of them rely on specific stats (Power, Precision, Ferocity for Power and Condition Damage, Expertise, and Precision for Condi) to maximise their damage outputs. Other stats such as Vitality, Toughness, and Healing Power do not affect damage output, meaning that they are not really worth it for DPS builds, as their whole point is to do as much damage as mathematically possible. However, there is some variance in which stat combinations are taken.  
---
* Power Builds
---
   * **Power** for obvious reasons: it increases the damage a skill does. All Power builds want as much Power as they can get. 
---
   * They need **Precision** as it increases the % chance their hits have to ciritically hit. This one is a bit more variable. Classes like Reaper (with Decimate Defenses), and Guardian (with Righteous Instincts \[not as much as it used to\]) can forgo a few pieces of **Berserker** Gear (Power ++ Precision+ Ferocity+) for **Valkyrie** Gear (Power++ Vitality+ Ferocity+) and get the same results as the extra precision is wasted. For classes without a lot of Crit Chance increasing traits, you nee to prioritize getting capped, so sometimes **Assassins** gear (Precision++ Power+ Ferocity+) is used to help reach 100% Crit Chance.
---
   * **Ferocity** increases how much extra damage critical hits do. Similar to power, you want as much as you can get here.
---
* Condi Builds
---
   * **Condition Damage** is to Condi Builds as Power is to Power builds. You want as much as you can get as it just straight up increases the damage your conditions do.
---
   * **Expertise** is also extremely important as it increases the duration of your Conditions, up to 100% (at which point the conditions applied do 2x as much damage). Some condition builds need a lot (Renegade, Mirage) because they lack an inate way to increase their main damaging Conditions. This means they need a lot of **Vipers** (Power ++ Condition Damage++ Expertise+ Precision+) to get that Expertise while also getting a significant ammount of Condition Damage. Other builds are able to Cap their primary  damaging condition (such Firebrand with Burning) without any Expertise at all and are able to use **Grieving** (Power++ Condition Damage++ Precision+ Ferocity+) or **Sinister** (Condition Damage++ Power+ Precision+).
---
   * **Precision** is somewhat important to Condi builds as some of them have traits that apply damaging conditions when they critically hit.
---
True. The chance of it being worth the effort is too low to bother any further.
---
So it's way less public than I thought, okay. Thanks for the explanation.
---
How hard is it to have a thread based conversation instead of passive aggressive bashing?
---
Open world is forgiving, and of course it’s easy to spec for damage.  That’s irrelevant to what I was talking about though.
---
Took a break from GW2 to play another MMO thanks to a Twitch promo and Anet really aren't trying to win me back. Between that and the return of City of Heroes I don't feel so bad about no longer purchasing gems. I have high hopes that since the restructuring GW2 will end up back on track but this is not how you treat your international playerbase.
---
Finally. I got a code from KFT back in the day, but didn't use it because Anet asked everyone to hold off until they got things worked out. Then they announced that all unused codes were invalid. I'll never wear this outfit, but it scratches my completionist  itch.
---

Not only was it a perfect opportunity, they intentionally overlapped the recap with another major event to fit that timeline. If the plan was always to release E6 on the 21^(st), it would have made significantly more sense to start the recap on April 16^(th), minimising the overlap to avoid dividing player attention. They also started hypeing E6 way too soon - the first teaser was revealed on April 5th, which would be a full six weeks and change before the 21^(st). If they were releasing it that late, they should have given us the teaser *now*. The only way I can see a release that late after all the buildup making sense is if they've somehow, after nearly a year in development, managed to hit eleventh-hour delays on this thing, which would just be embarrassing. If we don't get it next week, I would expect the week after at the absolute latest.
---
It's not so much a "simply don't buy them" issue though. No one ever takes the "click here if you are over X years old" buttons seriously. And the marketing in many lootbox cases is so insidious and predatory that it compels those with little self control. Much like some OSHA standards protecting the clumsy from self inflicted accidents, these types of regulations are designed to protect the psychologically vulnerable from impulse buys. 
---
That being said, I'm not against random rewards, just make it so that there is some way (no matter how convoluted or expensive) to get to the reward you want. That's why dungeons have currency, bl chests have statuettes, etc. There should be no item that is solely on a random loot table - you should be either able to craft or buy it in addition to rolling for it.
---
Elu uploaded a 32.5k today. This is not a good rotation so looks like I was right. Apology?
---
https://youtu.be/WoMV-2g0Gp0
---
What are you happy about exactly?
---
Yes ANET did do something in response to regulations (disabling gemstore items based on ip) but that's it. The issue is invisible to nearly the whole database and there is no motivation to work towards better solutions.
---
I have no choice to buy the items I want or participate in promotion sales. Let alone all r other promotions that are region locked.
---
This is not me but I found this video useful for improving my DH play. So maybe it can help you too.

Tbh, Eggs for Europeans and the rest of the world are kinda insulting ;s. I'm always getting same minis whenever I manage to get eggs from BLC.
---
Wish they for once could do a EU+rest exclusive promotion, so we could have cool items as well.
---
thats simply not true
---
The outfit and mini egg are not linked to the quests. They're gained on registration.
---
The theory of the exchange is sound, sure. It's the people in charge that are the weak link.
---
I rather like Norn engineer, gives me a vibe of Hiccup from How to train your dragon.
---
For Sylvari I rather enjoy necromancer. The whole circle of life idea, returning to the soil to be called on by a plant, hilarious.
---
Asura are great thinkers and I like the idea of Mesmer being that magical saboteur, lots of set ups to trick and deceive.
---
Humans... Typical guardian or warrior class, so bland, so average... Humans.
---
When you verify your email and complete registration by choosing a username, password, name, country, and state/province, you'll be presented with a popup for the outfit and a link to claim the egg (the latter says "not allowed to access" for me).
---
just curious, aren't codes region locked themselves?
---
Yep! I'd recommend setting up an account there though regardless of if you want to be private (if you were private, it'd show "PRIVATE" instead of character/account name on whatever role you were for the run). It's either a nice pat on the back for performing well or a way to check your progress / skill level without needing to install arcDPS yourself.
---
Genuinely curious. Why they can give away toy eggs (ingame item), but can't give away outfits (ingame item)?
---
I think I dont get your points right, you are complaining about banners, because warriors are bannerslaves.  But this patch is the whole oposite, now you can decide if you want to run condi , zerk, or bs... and the dps from these are very comparable if you can play your class.
---
I never got the pop up, so I made a new account and got it, thank you!
---
What about  
---
&gt;Queen Jennahs' for everyone!
---
If your rotation works you should be as much time outside of berzerk now as you used to be inside before, maybe even less
---
Disclaimer: I watched this at 2x speed with no sound
---
You missed a lot of little things that would have made this run smoother. Not reflecting the blizzard elemental's projectiles to protect the bonfires, wasting firewood on fires that are already full, chasing down the despawning adds after the elemental dies, and focusing on the corrupted ice when you could easily ignore them with a decent healer. This was just an average T2 run overall.
---
No.
---
I play at times that barely anyone is on. I ran this with randoms because none of my guildies are on, and it took me 2 days to find randoms because this fractal wasn't in the dailies. I agree that the gameplay could have been better but I think I made up with it with the commentary.

Why Endgame? How about Luke's father identity?

&gt; this is not how you treat your international playerbase
---
This is something you would say if ArenaNet literally did something that was, for example, racist towards a group outside their home country... Not when their promotional partners' events don't apply to your region. The logistics of certain things (such as organizing an international promotional or business partnership) are no doubt pretty complicated.
---
They give out the Dragon T-shirt codes at conventions, and they frequently attend such events in Germany, France, and the UK. The item has also been available from EU fansites in the past. 
---
In fact, here's a table showing times this item was available in the EU versus times when it wasn't.
---
Available In EU | Not Available in EU
---
---|---
---
Sixth Anniversary Meet &amp; Greet by ArenaNet (Cologne, Germany) | Kung Fu Tea Promotion
---
Sixth Anniversary Livestream on Twitch | PAX West 2018
---
Paris Games Week Expo 2018 | Post-Launch Events 2012 (May also have been available in the EU - need more info)
---
Halloween Diorama Contest Prize | 
---
Gamescom 2012 (In-Person) | 
---
Gamescom 2012 Follow Up (EU Fansites) | 
---
ArenaNet treats their international fanbase just fine - they have official translations for three languages outside of English (Four if you count KZ's efforts in China,) *do* attend international gaming events, and have community partners and host those individuals' streams, contests, and other events frequently.
---
Yeah this seems like a halfway decent bundle. I went ahead and got it, really hoping the Wild Magic Glider/BP is in the Week 3 selection. Been wanting that one for awhile now.
---
Just use a VPN and register yourself.
---
ty!
---
Mario would be a better game is you got a gun and it was a battle royal.
---
Tetris would be a better game if it was had stats and you could level up your blocks.
---
Guild Wars 2 would be a better game if you had to grind for gear.
---
What you describe is literally the point of the game. It is it's defining characteristic and its major selling point: You never have to grind to have fun. You can just... have fun.
---
Of they changed this the game would be dead in a week. Because everyone would leave. If you want to grind for 50 to 100 hours before you're allow3d to have fun, there are games that do that better than GW2 would.
---
Regardless, it's a major setback from the original items that did work fine using macro's. It's a small issue in the grand scheme of things, but should be addressed. Many players expect to be able to macro and purchase the items only to find out A-net killed them off.   
---
Depending on your definition of broken. They ARE broken relative to what they once were. That much is clear.
---
:O  I said NOTHING
---
You’d be my saint good sir!
---
Are you running a vpn through the US?
---
I am using an incognito window in chrome also. Not sure, if that makes a difference.

off topic, but this is the cutest bear ever
---
I didn't realise they still handed it out at events, that is good to know. I have obtained an outfit from this promotion anyway thanks to other replies on this post but that's a fair point. Arguably the biggest promotions have excluded the EU though. Not everyone is able to go to a convention and the US and the EU aren't the only places on Earth...
---
For openly calling attention to your shady practices.

No, just a little when I was starting out didn't really know what to do, and later It didn't even join me so I kinda gave up on it.

&gt;This promotion provides different kinds of prizes depending on where you you live, because of the way our partner Alienware built it (the Dell part of this is not available outside of the US). European players are able to grab a Miniature Egg if they register to Alienware Arena. We're working on promotions that will be available to our European players later.

I used to think exactly like you then I started to enjoy the game for what it provides rather than hating it for what it does differently.

I suppose I can see the argument being made that they aren't as fair to players outside the US and EU (and, maybe, China)... But I doubt they have the budget or other capabilities to visit every region on Earth. No doubt the US and EU are where their players are - with the exception of Australia and Asia, those two regions are the ones where you will find the most gamers, after all.
---
Hey mate, u can get ban for it? I want to get this outfit too
---
I agree, but what perplexes me is what kind of punishment would those players get? A week or so of chat ban sounds reasonable, but banning the whole account would be too much as afaik there isn't a movie spoiler policy under ToS.

I get an infinite registration/login loop.  I'm logged into the site, but the vault wants me to login, which I can't do because I already have an account, so it tells me to login with an existing account at a linked login page, which just refreshes the page vault page.
---
Even with level scaling, the difference between a level 10 character and a level 80 in a starter zone is like night and day. You have better equipment and fully trained skills,  you can easily dunk on early game enemies if you tried. As for reaching max level - are you really expecting to do insane damage to enemies in level 80 zones? You want things to be faceroll easy up there? Where's the fun in that?
---
If you approach this game with a different mindset you'll find that the lack of "factions" encourages people to work together, and it fosters a generally friendly community. It's refreshing and can work to your advantage in many ways. There's a separate mode called World vs. World to scratch your open world PvP itch (and yes, your gear matters there).
---
A nerf is anything that weakens or reduces the effectiveness something. A profession or build/playstyle is considered nerfed as a whole if the amount of nerfs in an update outweigh the buffs. However, the things that are buffed could be buffs to other builds/playstyles. But if the overall potential of the profession is reduced, no matter which build/playstyle is being used, then the profession is nerfed.
---
TL;DR something is nerfed if it is overall worse
---
No, that's Niv-Mizzet in the Novel.
---
Wait, so who has to go up his ass to win this
---
if you already have alienware accounts can you not get the mini toy egg and outfit? I'm not seeing any place to get it once logged in.
---
Third endurance bar is pretty insignificant (its one extra evade per fight, no matter how long that fight goes), and the improved dodgerolls come with their own downsides (And the most used one has the biggest downsides by far).
---
US fucked EU again XD
---
As a player with 3500+ hours i would like to share my opinion on this, as I feel there are a few things that should be mentioned.  
---
Regarding your first point of mobs scaling, your armor is what will make the biggest difference to this and somewhat counters your third point, with a good full ascended build you will notice the difference in damage you are dealing. Armor really does make a difference within PVE and WvW, although as you say does not affect PVP and is implemented in this way so that PVP stays balanced for all players. For end game content such as raids, good armour is a must.  
---
As for your second point you should really try out WvW, where there are huge battles between multiple servers in order to capture and defend objectives. This is the closest to the Alliance vs Horde mechanic mentioned that you will find in the game. Again your build and armor will make a huge difference in this area. Also, I believe the game really begins once you hit level 80, this is when you can focus on gearing you characters and tailoring them for the desired end game content.   
---
Overall I would recommend looking into getting ascended armor and trying out Fractals/Raid/WvW, to get a good measure of the game and what it has to offer post level 80. Hope this helps and gives some insight into what else this gear game has to offer.
---
It's when you shoot plastic projectiles with suction cups on your enemy. Legendary pistol gen 3.
---
It doesn't need to make sense lol, read your combat log to understand the damage it's doing. ANet fucks up a lot of stuff, a little tooltip inaccuracy is the least of their mess ups
---
We only maintain a list of accounts that we suggest to our regular users not to trade with because they broke subreddit rules, scammed another user (which also is against subreddit rules) or broke GW2 ToS (which is also against subreddit rules).
---
One of our moderation duties is also assisting users in finding fair pricing and if we find unfair or unreasonable pricing, we let our users know. 
---
No one ever claimed that you were a scammer, you were banned for insulting moderators, which is against subreddit rules.
---
I was able to redeem the Dragon Emblem Outfit codes on my alt accounts. The Toy Miniature Egg page is broken, though, but probably not worth the effort.
---
There are some other stats combos than just Berserker and Viper that are useful, but as others mentioned, those tend to be the best for DPS which is why they are used most often. But depending on what you do, you may not want to be full DPS. For example, I know some WvWs mix in more survivability with stuff like Marauder rather than full Berserker.
---
Also, it is worth mentioning that while full Berserker with Scholar runes or such may be ideal for max DPS, if it doesn't work for you then I'd say it is fine to use other stats. For example, my Ele has had Soldier Armor and Berserker Trinkets as my main gear for years with a Berserker Armor swap if I really need the extra DPS; though since I am pretty familiar with Ele I've been working to swap Soldier for Marauder instead. I also have Diviner Trinkets so there are a decent number of combinations I can have depending on what is needed.
---
So while full Berserker would be best DPS, for stuff like open world or story I'd say it is fine to use gear like Soldiers to take more than two hits before going ingdowned. But if you do start to get better at playing the profession with dodges and such, it can be worth transition more to full Berserker/Viper or at least having a gear swap for when you can pull it off.
---
Because giving something worthwhile instead of an egg requires them to do an entirely different promo.
---
This led me on a skin unlocking quest... bounty hunter chest with elegy legs. Fashion Wars 2 continues.
---
They said US only, but it was really easy to circumvent those "restrictions" and get a code anyway.
---
However, this time it's clear from the start and is probably enforced more strictly.
---
I'm already registered because of the Festive Hat, yet this shovelloginware site is asking me to create an account *again* even when I'm already *logged in*!
---
And I can't even find those darn toy eggs on their promo pages. I wish all these sites burned in fire together with all the useless adcrap that their customers are forced to pay for if they just want a darn simple physical object.
---
Well thats exactly what i think Silver but it seems on reddit the gw2 playerbase does not want this. Weirdly enough on other forums/Reddit pages other people also want the lootboxes gone and say it is ruining games. But as soon you talk about it in Gw2 you get downvoted this also has been proven multiple times.
---
From your other comments, seems like youre just starting and already saying alot which, if you had dived into more game modes wouldnt have been an issue/complaint for you.
---
As others said really try wvw and raids: they seem like the 2 things you're missing. 
---
And yea, theres loads of different gears looks with u only really needing ascended stat as the highest/worling towards leggy. part of the game is collecting all the different types tho, and as youl find out gw2 has real fashion endgame :&gt;
---
Lastly mastery points will be good to keep busy, 283 is max atm aquired thro mixed Content. The HoT mastery tracks will keep you busy for a while with a mix of raids/lws3/adventures/metas/events and story. Anyway hope you find what youre looking for ^
---
Why would breaking subreddit rules mean my GW2 account was listed as Do Not Trade? How are those two things related?
---
Lol, try graduating school first before talking like you know how businesses should operate
---
Give me a date and I tell you if I'm ready.
---
They could just give us the outfit like they are doing with the mini egg. Its the least they can do.
---
Cool story.
---
she has a personal grudge against me and got banned after insulting and blocking me.
---
I was only able to find the Toy Miniature Egg claim page from the modal dialog with the outfit code (which is US only). But I don't have permission to access the page.
---
One of these days I'm going to get my AWA level up just in case they give away something big again. They gave away Heart of Thorns to at least 10,000 people, but only if your level was high enough.
---
*crying in noteveneuropean*
---
Just tried with Chrome and it didn't make any difference, I'm running out of mail address x)
---
I am not getting the pop up.
---
I think it's justified. Banning you from the subreddit wouldn't be sufficient to prevent you from contacting people making trades on there. Though it might incorrectly label you as a scammer when you're not, it's still more effective than a mere ban.
---
Ah, I’ve explained it a bit wrong maybe. The EPIS exclusion system is separate from the license governing. If tomorrow it would be decided that a new license is created for game publishers and it’s decided that they will need to use EPIS, then this would not require a lot of work. There is already a system in place for online gambling websites (eg unibet.be, ladbrokes.be,..) that can be used for this.
---
If you read the report of the commission, one of the first recommendations is actually to create a new license for game devs/publishers: https://www.gamingcommission.be/opencms/export/sites/default/jhksweb_nl/documents/onderzoeksrapport-loot-boxen-Engels-publicatie.pdf
---
However, the commission can not write laws, it can only ask for new/updated legislation and provide some input.
---
So now it’s a waiting game until politics think it’s a good time/idea to put this in a law of some sorts.
---
I can't even find a link to the toy egg page anymore after closing out the outfit code page.
---
I wouldn't buy either until you can get Both, as both together is actually cheaper than just one most of the time and you're wasting money.
---
If someone put a gun to my head and made me pick, I would pick Heart of Thorns. Next in the story, still some DPS specs, and most important it's more replayable than PoF is.
---
PoF was the better initial playthrough experience for me, but when you're done you're done. HoT has more events to keep you occupied until you can buy Season 3 and PoF.
---
Uh.. ok
---
Legendary items are just skin and convenience, they don't offer extra combat stats compared to ascended.
---
I think we would make a bad job as moderators, if we would recommend to our regular users to trade with accounts that we would personally not trade with because they broke subreddit rules.
---
&gt; If you're expecting to do a lot of damage, while spec-ing for tank and heal, then you're nothing but an idiot.
---
I never said I was expecting to do a lot of damage.  When specing into Druid you give up a trait line that could be an offensive trait line (which was perfectly fine) and now it’s a double-down with a decrease in pet stats.
---
Thematically, it has been rationalized and I can buy into the logic.  It’s just weird given how the ranger traits synergize around the pets and a trait line now has anti-synergy with the pet.
---
&gt; Also, you may want to work on that replying tactic. You don't need to downvote to reply to someone (they're 2 different "buttons")
---
Two different buttons with two different functions.  
---
But since you seem to care I only downvoted your comment about ‘IQ’ because it felt (to me) to be unconstructive to the discussion at hand.  Feel free to maintain that opinion.
---
Did you tunnel to the US with TunnelBear, register for AWA, then verify your email in an Incognito window, then chose a username, password, country, and province/state, all with ad-blocking software off? Those are all the required steps.
---
I'm sorry, is he off some importance?
---
Hey if we can't talk about issues with some of the new class changes in this community where can we? 
---
I could always post over at /r/mmorpg but I figure this community would be more apt to listen and discuss than get an outside community to rip GW2 apart.
---
pretty much any support spec helps carrying a lot. popular support specs include but are not limited to:
---
boon chrono: quickness+alacrity + a lot of utility/QOL tricks
---
druid: heals+might+spirits (got nerfed a little with this last patch so jury is still out on how good it is now)
---
healbrand: quickness+heals+aegis spam
---
renegade: alacrity+heals
---
scourge: barrier+resurrects
---
heal tempest: TONS of heals+ auras
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
I already have a firebrand, sorry I should have stated it was support :P
---
So, rythlock dies?
---
enter "10 minute mail" in google and use any of those. they worked for me. 
---
are you sure that you are running a vpn with a US ip?
---
what
---
US only, US only, yay a Miniature egg.  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I still hate whoever came up with the term "BS" or "bannerslave" for a banner warrior. I didn't like it to begin with, but seeing the entire community addopting these terms just caused utter hate to grow inside of me. It's just disrespectfull.
---
&gt; there aren't any hard enemies I could come back to after reaching some high level to feel like I've gotten stronger and can laugh at him after giving me harsh times in early levels, because everythings scales with your. It feels like levels doesn't matter, leveling to lvl.80 is fun but after I do it I don't feel anything like ''I did it'' because I just do slighty more damage to mobs I fought 30 levels ago.
---
This is such a weird argument to me. Like, you think the game would be improved if the entirety of the 1-80 world just disappeared once you hit level cap? I'm sorry, but I think the sheer amount of opportunities for *actual gameplay* to occur in a level capped zone far outweigh the benefits of feeling big and strong because you did 341690725 damage to a level 1 trash mob.
---
why do they even have death animations
---
Open world isn't how you judge your progression when you are level 80.  Doing fractals and raids is end game, and the way you judge how you've grown as a level 80.
---
Gear isn't as big of an advantage as other games, as gw2 end game is more built on skill and having a good knowledge of your classes full kit as well as learning the mechanics and tricks for each fight.
---
Condi Berserker is currently the fourth best Small Hitbox class on Snowcrows. Sixth best DPS overall. Not only does that seem pretty good, it's competing with Renegade for best condi class overall.
---
Anyone have a link to the egg?  I never got the pop-up.
---
I thought he "retired".
---
hey, that's me
---
NP I'm [patient](https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/)
---
A full continent not drip fed over several years a la guild wars 1 Elona for example in one go rather than over 2 years. Everything in my opinion at the minute just takes far to long to get anywhere. I don’t mind the he actual content in living story per se but it’s just so slow moving and seems to focus so much around the cash shop than anything innovative.
---
I agree 100 %
---
Link to the post pls.
---
Ooh. So renegade to go then. thank you for clarifying xD
---
Wrong functionality of Sleight of Hand interacting with Swipe, the trait is giving the Daze but it's not reducing the recharge time on 20%.
---
There can definitely be a case to make for the benefits daredevil gets not being strong enough to make up for the drawback, or having design flaws that make them non-ideal. Just stating the unique things daredevil does get on top of what regular thief has, because they are there :p
---
So I assume you like to look at small penises.
---
Oh I'm sorry. Are you angry I didn't post fan art or another terrible meme?
---
Should have I posted a comic that looks like it was drawn by a 5 year old instead because that seems to go over well also
---
The entirety of Boon Chrono's existence.
---
But like, he said nothing of substance.  If you want to add something of substance to build from his sentiment, I’d invite you to do so because I’m interested to hear it.
---
But saying something is awkward without saying what makes it feel that way makes it hard to discuss.
---
As the adage goes: “Without data you’re just a person with an opinion”. In this case, the data would be the interactions with descriptions and reasoning.  Until then it’s a soft squishy opinion.
---
True, but the benefits already came with drawbacks. This is just another drawback thrown ontop of it that destroys the balance.
---
I skipped the 50% deal once, so unless there is an additional benefit to that deal, buying it now would make my patient waiting until now go to wast. Then I could've bought it back when it was 50% off the first time.
---
They technically just humans in terms of rigging and animations.
---
Worked out, thank you for foolproof instructions!
---
Charr warrior riding Badger bunny - is that like Ungat Trunn riding Lord Brocktree! xD
---
I am not angry at all. I just thought I give you some pointers, why your post is being downvoted.
---
Why does this scare me?
---
That 10 minute mail is a blessing.
---
Yes I am sure, I'd be redirected to the european site otherwise.
---
2-3 more tries later and I still haven't gotten a pop-up, don't even really know when it is supposed to happen :(
---
I also like downed state but dislike rallying.
---
I wish they would make everyone spawn in downed state. Maybe you could like slide along the ground or something.
---
This is a not so rare chance to observe an idol worshiper in its natural environment.
---
&gt; wait for benchmarks
---
I'm going to have to agree with that after looking at that gw2exchange thread lol
---
Thank you for this, was able to get my code from EU!
---
Not a paying player yet so sadly I can’t use the Trading Post :(
---
But if I get to level 80 without quitting, which is what normally happens when I play an MMO, then I’m buying the expansions!
---
its not dead,its REPLACEBLE for months now.
---
I love that the desert fox is there.
---
This really takes me back to a simpler time.

Sound like a new thief elite spec.

This happened to me.  I did a reset password and got the codes.

Bound and Impaling lotus interact poorly with stealth, but also "retaliation" type effects. Biggest case would be Full-Counter which *really* hurts. They can also be interrupted, which results in on-interrupt triggers which also often really hurt. Dash has the downside that if you get crippled or chilled, you seriously screw up your endurance regeneration.
---
:D

flute used to auto stop note and play again if you press the same note twice. now the second press does nothing but instead extend the note length. this kills any sones you want to play that has repeated notes. a 800gem item, broken and unplayable :&gt;
---
Yeah awaits US residents only apparently
---
I don't think they have an issue with how you get your gold since you always know what you get ( 400gems for 50g or w/e the ratio is ).
---
If that was a problem ecto gamble would be "illegal" as well.
---
They could create another currency that has the same value as gems and can be used the same way gems are used that's acquired  by turning your gold into it ( same way the gold to gems conversion works ).
---
This way the gamestore would allow you to buy the "illegal" items but only using the new currency. Even if you buy gems turn them to gold ( you're safe here ) then turn them to the new currency it's still not real life money gambling.
---
Honestly the whole system is weird imo and there are still many ways around it like VPNs. It's mostly an inconvenience for people that want to buy them.
---
I waited the last time when the outfit was available through a giveaway because i thought a similar event for europe would arrive sooner or later. But now: fuck this, VPN works, i'm not fooled by your lousy game again
---
Any change they do to impact support Chronomancer
---
Thanks.

Lynx, axe/axe, Gs
---
@since we run out of time, just go with 1:51. Reeee. I only hope pugs take 5-10 mins on last boss on terrible instabilities day.
---
I don't even trust my own server in WvW, so I guess I can't log in at all then.
---
Sorry I was rude 👁️
---
&gt; I agree the hella damage is fun, but I feel like the rotation is completely borked to get to that 30k range.
---
For me, executing the same rotation over and over again is unfun and boring in general.
---
Seeing as he's one of the people who pushed for these berserker changes, that must feel pretty bad for him. Design is hard
---
I think I won a key for Path of Fire? Is that actually one of the prizes?
---
That's pretty much the meta for leveling. You can grab all the pets you can. At L80, grab the new pets from expansions.
---
What does the outfit look like? Is it that shitty white t shirt and khaki shorts one? If so big pass.
---
Thanks :)
---
Paths. There are different paths you can choose to complete the dungeon. Makes for solid replayability and different strats.
---
Glint: Did you Brand the world?
---
Kralk: Yes.

Glint: What did it cost?

Kralk: Everything.
---
Nice. I like giftable free stuff.
---
I, for one, welcome our Bloodstone Fennec overlords.
---
Well I think Anets main class design goal is to create fun gameplay in general in all game modes and not to optimize min/maxing dps rotations for content that is only played by a small minority.
---
Doesn't seem like it, but I'm taking it as a satire over the white male crybabies who whine every time there aren't at least 5 white male characters on a movie poster.
---
Thank you :)
---
Yes.

---
It would also be weird to have a month long Return to Tyria promotion and then not release the episode right afterward, but here we are.
---
Basically this.  Daredevil was nuked pretty hard in sPvP from the HoT days.  Thief's strength as a roaming +1 got pretty silly when combined with strong dueling power from daredevil.  It really couldn't get buffed much while it worked so seamlessly with a roaming build.  While the latest patch certainly didn't get it all the way there, the extent to which swipe really hurts a thief's rotational power opens up some budget to actually make it a useful duelist.
---
I thought he quit GW2 at some point.
---
Well good news is there's not much point buying gear before 80 because you'll outlevel it quickly :)  Best of luck!
---
like that desert fox in place of Rocket
---
Ok yeah. I don't want that lol. Shouldn't even be in the game it looks ridiculous having people walking around in modern day clothing with a GW2 logo on the shirt.
---
indeed, my friend. Medium and Light armor IMO.
---
Few words about the movie, that are enough to make it unfun to watch, just few words that describe the whole thing, only shows how bad the movies are nowadays; should anyone care?
---
Bait title and omegalul gameplay.
---
OK ty
---
kinda redundant don't you think, when just 1, 2, 3 would be enough.
---
People might be a little more receptive if this wasn't just clickbait.  I'm not super fond of the new berserker either, but he doesn't actually talk about *how* or *why* Berserker is awkward or unfun to play.
---
Assume whatever makes you happy, MP.
---
A miserable little pile of weaknesses

Fuckin good, I actually have a sub I can browse for the next week or two now. Thanks &lt;3
---
I don't see Koss
---
Spiderman comes  back and thanos loses
---
I can't look now but if I remember right most players PvE than anything else from previous stats.
---
They seem to tweak most changes to balance PvP which is definitely the least played mode.
---
I just assume you get off on spreading sexual insults in game forums when you run out of arguments.
---
No, but PAX West is out of the way for many US players as well - Needing to travel is NOT a requirement that is specific only to EU players! For both NA and EU there are options available from home (streams and anniversary events), and other regional events that are available to them, based on whether or not they are willing to travel (or jump through the hoops of some contest or promotion.) 
---
But, you also have to understand how much easier it is for people from certain parts of Europe to travel as well. The cost is always going to be there, whether you're driving or flying from Canada to the US, or taking the same methods in the EU. However, as a former resident of the EU now living in the US, it's far easier to travel between countries that are part of the EU than it would be for, say, a resident of Mexico to visit the US.
---
Of course, this won't apply to everyone, and the cost and distance definitely factor in, but the EU generally has far better infrastructure that makes traveling even across country borders a lot more time and cost efficient than it is to travel between countries (and, sometimes even states) in North America.
---
\+1 
---
They worked so hard to make awesome enemies and animations and you almost can't see them cause all the effects...
---
It's not a sexual insult. It's about your massive ego, which I assume comes from a lack elsewhere. Who knows, it might just be that you have a shitty personality.
---
Send them to me instead  (ノ￣v￣)ノ
---
I can promise you that if they were able to, they would have. It’s not like they purposely want to shaft other countries. They have a timeline of events in place for the season finale and them delaying a promotion all because a few countries can’t get an outfit right now is not feasible what so ever. 
---
Be glad they gave you anything.
---
This is my opinion as well. I believe this makes for a stronger foundation, though perhaps there shouldve been changes to improve dueling in this patch already, seeing how infrequent gw2 balance patches are. But I think it's a good change.
---
I'm not a pro on dh cuz I'm new to the class myself but been playing him for roughly 2 weeks now. 4 weeks would be exact but i don't like being 11k health so i took almost 2 weeks of crafting my own build and ran a bit off meta. Dps is still very competitive. Easily hit 21-28k on Xera, Gors, Deimos pug range. 
---
I learned a few tips from a friend. I'll share what i remembered. he gave me lots of tips but i honestly didn't know much about the class at the time. so i was ooh ahh the moment i figured things out. 
---
Always get gs2 in a symbol, aka gs4, it'll up your damage. 
---
Activate f1 whenever it's off cd. And try to get gs2 and/or focus4 when your f1 is on. If you switch to scepter/focus and your f1 is off cd, then hold focus4 till then. 
---
Retaliation helps line up the damage too as it gives you 25% more crit chance. Reta from your f1, gs4 and your heal. during Gors breakbar, he has perma retaliation and it hurts if you go full burst. I'd use my heal and burst quick when my reta still up to squeeze out bit dps also protect the damage from you for a short time. 
---
Speaking of breakbar, you'd do more damage during this time when bar is broken, try to time and get your burst in. 
---
I really enjoy dh now but I'd probably fix my build to increase more damage. Glhf!
---
 Following the battle, the Avengers hold a funeral for Stark. Thor appoints [Valkyrie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valkyrie_(Marvel_Comics)) the Queen of Asgard and joins the [Guardians of the Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(2008_team)). Meanwhile, Rogers returns the Infinity Stones and Thor's hammer to their original timelines, but decides to live the rest of his life in the past with Carter instead of returning to the present. Now as an elderly man, he arrives to pass on [his shield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_America%27s_shield) to [Sam Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_(comics)).
---
By a few countries, you mean 160+ vs the one they are offering it to. Lol. They could have, it’s the lack of effort that has been a pattern is what I think most people are frustrated about. They got the backlash from the Kung fu fiasco, they should have planned better and put the effort in to make over half their user base happy too.
---
Thematically I think Necro would be closer. Rev deals with the mists and the echo's therein. The necro deals with death and the afterlife. And while generally necro deals with the corpse (matter) and lifeforce of a deceased person, the ritualist deals with the spirits and the spirit world. You could say the spirit world in Guild Wars is the mists, however the mists is also much more than that.

After looking through all the comments and trying several suggestions by other members I thought it might be useful to compile a step-by-step for anyone who is struggling with accessing the code(s)/outside of the US. Credit to everyone who pieced together what worked for them, I had to do a bit of wiggling myself to get my VPN to work (tunnel bear wouldn't connect properly).   
---
Step 1: Get Google Chrome (even if you just toss it out after, I could not get it to work on Brave or Firefox)  
---
Step 2: Get working VPN (many have recommended tunnel bear (didn't work for me very well) ) - I ended up using [hide.me](https://hide.me/en/) VPN  - Make an account/download whatever you need and boot up your VPN of choice. **Make sure to set it to USA.** 
---
Step 3: With VPN enabled, boot up google chrome. **Make sure you have no ad-block on in case it bounces the popup with the codes!** 
---
Step 4: Got to [10 Minute Mail](https://10minutemail.net/) or use an email service of your choice (10MM lets you use a throw away that gets recycled). Be aware when you sign up in the next step you might have to re-try registering a few times if the mail addy is still being refreshed from the last recycled use (it does work though!).   
---
Step 5: Go to the Alienware website link [here!](https://na.alienwarearena.com/account/register?promotion_token=41fba16c-111b-42db-a261-f3018b2442e5) and follow the instructions:
---
\- Fill out the first part of the form   
---
\- Refresh 10MM (use the link on the page itself to refresh) or just check your selected email/inbox.   
---
\- Click on the activation link (I clicked on the URL directly just in case)   
---
\- Fill out the rest of the registration, ensure you have USA and a State selected!   
---
Step 6: Once registered fully a window should pop up fairly quickly with your code for your **outfit.** ***DO NOT NAVIGATE AWAY FROM THIS YET.***   
---
Step 7: Screenshot/copy paste your outfit code for redemption, then make sure to click on the blue hyperlink **above the** outfit code that tells you to *'get your mini egg'.* It will then open another window/tab with the same info, click the small **x on the right hand side to close the tab with the outfit code on it, then you should see on the main screen of the new tab/page a 'get code' button beside a very large picture of an egg.**   
---
Step 8: Click 'Get Code', copy/screenshot your code and then follow the instructions to redeem both of them on your account!  
---
**ENJOY YOUR FREE LOOTS.**  
---
I also have **one** outfit code for I don't need for anyone who is having trouble. The first person to ask for it in a reply will get it via pm but I am happy to try and help anyone if they get stuck!
---
The fact that you feel a slight pet nerf invalidated druid in OPEN WORLD is the funniest part of your rant.
---
The fact that you are crying so much over a slight pet nerf verifies how overpowered pets were, if you were able to do comparable damage with an AI while spec-ing for tank/heal yourself.
---
&gt; ...you seem to care...
---
You think I care about internet points? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
May want to go scan through my comment history and come back to me about that one before you look like a bigger idiot than you already do from crying about open world effectiveness of druids after a slight pet nerf, especially one that's spec'd for healer/tank.
---
Right in the spot [https://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/img/xLgPeuq6CW9A2N2V2kKmhMT6h2o=/1092x0/2019/03/14/dd4d8d9c-5f16-4f6b-a7d8-65a00d095c2c/avengers-endgame-poster-square-crop.jpg](where Rocket is) on the Avengers: Endgame poster. Hilarious.
---
A lot of guilds have moved from server to server or quit/broke up.
---
You are probably left behind on one of the low tier servers.
---
Use gw2efficiency and search the servers by activity to find a server that has high activity during your playtimes (then eat the transfer fee)
---
That’s your best bet to find an active server which will also have a few guilds running at your own active playtimes.
---
Good luck and welcome back!
---
Hey, that's you
---
The stupid outfit is HIGHLY sought after. Gifting that to US citizens only while gifting a ~~used cumsock~~ Mini Egg to everyone else really isn't too bad a reason to flip them off.
---
That should not have made me laugh, but there you go.
---
hmm maybe Gorrik is the ant men.. you know the bugs etc
---
&gt; people walking around in modern day clothing
---
I can't tell if your bitter or insane? That outfit fits in the game perfectly fine. If anything, other than the logo, its more normal than a lot of other outfits.
---
Ok, what does that do for me in Canada? Hi, I'm NA but always excluded anyway :)
---
My name is Fennec Montoya, you killed my father prepare to die!
---
From raid clearing I think. You can still see him playing open world and buildcrafting, and he's relevant in this case simply because he really wants Power Berserker to be good. Sounds like he's disappointed with his results so far. I still want to try it though. Power Berserker looks fun.
---
Out of curiosity, what Traits would you replace Berserker with to end up with more damage? I'm no expert, but I'd imagine that the combination of Always Angry, Fatal Frenzy, Bloody Roar and Berserk's inherent 15% speed boost (not to mention a T3 Berserker's Power buff, seeing as Berserk is now considered a T3 Burst skill) would be hard to top in terms of raw damage output.
---
Is this about the t-shirt with the Gw2 logo? I thought those were handed to people in real life events. Isn't this like making the Royal guard outfit available to everyone?
---
Ffxiv is so well optimized but I still love gw2 more for some reason.
---
Being max level with all your traits and a decent gear setup is a huge difference from a level five character in low level gear and no traits. I can go to queensdale or metrics province and 1-2 shot the majority of things there compared to a fresh char who doesnt have gear.
---
Beware gw2 pvp has no 5 man queue ranked, making it even more meme than it already is.
---
i know, it's exciting
---

This was once fixed but it came back like a week later and is still bugged.
---
The funniest part I find is the triggering by the open world piece of my original comment and having nothing to say or add besides regressing to insults.
---
You do you salty-McGoo.
---
Thank you!
---
Guardian, but I've always been a sucker for paladin type characters.
---
Yeah, it’s honestly one of the things that keep me from playing this game for long periods of time. It just makes doing trains abysmal.
---
It's kind of depressing seeing so many people here complaining that the rework is bad just because it doesn't do good DPS on the testing golem.
---
I'm just happy that it's fun to play and viable. That's all I ever wanted out of the spec, and it's the reason why I played it through the years even though it's terrible.
---
The GIF is only 30 fps, but the actual flickering is much faster.
---
How is it gay?
---
I would rather have something personal, something tied to account that I can take other people in like the home instance, I often take my friends in because it is something I have worked with collecting nodes and cats. I have done a lot upgrading and decorating for my guilds hall too but it very much came down to just a handful of people to contribute since people lacked interest if there was no return, or they can just get the return from other peoples contributions.
---
Thanks, that worked.
---
report sent to anet. thanks for the heads up
---
For most recipients, it's a net loss to redeem the egg.
---
This theory is anisinine.
---
But Taimi is likeable...
---
For me it would be 
---
1. Inventory slots 
---
2. Tools
---
3. Salvage-o-matic 
---
4. The rest
---
What d/d nerf :( my condis gone or what ? Been been away for a little time now
---
Wait are you serious? I don’t own any of the skins so I might have to try this😑
---
*Daily Ambient Killer flashbacks*
---
I love charr revenant. It suits the lore perfectly and the animations are great. 
---
Also norn necro and sylvari necro. I love sylvari humor, putting together with necro, death humor is lolling worthy. Norn lives a simple life and a norn necro just looks and sound badass with tattoos added on top.
---
i believe one of the SAB launcher ads already had a similar issue. not pretty.
---
I might be stupid but what exactly do you lose when redeeming the egg?
---
Notice how i said "if ANYONE is lyssa"? I don't think she's hiding as anyone, but they have shown powers most similar to hers, that is on the scale of what she can do.
---
That's true. They could actually just call them either spirits or turrets, in the same way that any profession gains skill trees not usually available to then once they specialise. But it would be a bit odd.
---
This is exactly what I'm talking about. Moderators should have more maturity than making passive aggressive comments and name-dropping people they're having personal disagreements with.
---
You say that it makes sense, from a design perspective, to be super strong while in Berserk and weak outside of it, then you go on to complain about why it's not a good thing?
---
A big part of this rework was to make Berserker feel like an actual Berserker class from other games and less like Core Warrior v2. The fact that Berserker is weak when outside of Berserk mode is a fine niche for the class to be in, and if anything, they should look to buff the actual Berserk mode if need be (which I don't think it really needs buffs anyway).
---
At the end of the day, it's super fun to play and it's viable in PvE and decent (if a little cheesy) in competitive modes.
---
that's "benchmark" where there's no moving no dodging no bs of any kind where alec is 100%. the bench also has kind of unrealistic precasting to inflate the bench number. You'd be lucky to get about 70-80% of bench in raids while other classes can get higher with lower effort.
---
Times like this I wish GW2Hook had the ability to do this.  Considering it can remove fog.. you never know..
---
The average value received when opening a Toy Mini Egg is a tradable mini worth less than 5 silver. Even if you don't own the mini, in the time it takes you to go through the entire process of registering for Alienware Arena and claiming/entering the code, one could earn a lot more than 5 silver doing just about any in-game activity.
---
"wait, we're fighting who now?"
---
I would have prefered (is that even english?) to be a berserk, instead of having a berserk mode.
---
The two things that got me hyped for the game before launch was a devblog about mesmers, and one about the sylvari.
---
They looked so awesome I decided that I had to get the game as soon as it came out, and I wasn't disappointed.
---
The DirectX 12 mod solves a lot of those problems. XIV is still better optimized, but the mod closes the gap significantly.
---
&gt; yet is still worse than core warrior dps wise.
---
That more the fault of Axe Mastery being super over-tuned than Berserker being flawed.
---
I'm a deadeye hater. Pew-pewing from afar looks cool but I found the gameplay novelty wears off and I just go back to the high-octane fun of Daredevil. 
---
Playing against deadeye is just a bore. IMO a sniper has no real place in a game that aims for you. Especially on thief, which is supposed to be a high-risk class.
---
... enlighten me on this mod...
---
Where's Logan
---
I'm worried about this poster because it doesn't show Kas or Jory I really hope Dragons watch will come back together completely to fight the dragon.
---
I personally just can't stand FFXIV's mostly static gameplay and the horrible fetchquest chain that the (fully mandatory) main storyline is most of the time.
---
It's okay, I'm already a BL Chest whale so I'll pass /s
---
whatever, snowflake.
---
took me a hot minute to figure out, but i noticed it happening consistently during key runs, even on pretty much empty queensdale maps.

Why is this garbage trash movie so overrated and overhyped holy fuck its pissing me off
---
TIL that those green orbs are not representation of someone getting xp
---
Finally, a meta build that my dog can play. I'm sure he'll be hyped about this.
---
Not the "one". Fifty. 'Murica is fifty states.
---
I hate fetch quests :/ the combat isn't too bad for me. There's a lot of skills and the timing matters with chain attacks so I actually find the ffxiv button mashing more busy and requiring more attention. The actual mechanics in gw2 though are so deep and definitely provides out of the box gameplay and improvising.
---
My unpopular opinion is that I like my banners, granted the community is mainly at fault for the 'every warrior has to be a BS mindset' just like with the chronojail thing. Anet wasn't the one that said Warriors need to constantly run banners for group content.
---
And even if they *did* remove banners, they'd have to rework Inspiring Banners (which would most likely be a nerf to the overall DPS of the class if ANet replaces it with something that isn't a damage modifier, though they could always turn around and make yet another upkeep trait to contend with).
---
Personally, banners are a necessary evil, but that doesn't mean you're required to slot them, more than enough people (like myself) who enjoy the build enough to follow around DPS Berserkers like a squire to their knight.
---
I'm pretty sure the Alienware graphics amplifier only works with select Alienware laptops, due to it using a proprietary port.
---
There are other external GPU boxes that use thunderbolt 3 ports. If your Mac has those ports, you'd be able to use.
---
Don't run the fb as the healer, it totally defeats the purpose of running the FB/Ren duo.
---
Here is something that will blow your mind: Your ~~soul~~ personal details are probably already exposed through something else. ISP, cell phone, etc.
---
Berserker is perfect for what I want to play and the rework made it even cooler &lt;3
---
No other game's Berserker class feels like GW2's and I love it.
---
What do you want to see? People calculating real price of the package? It is overpriced package for 1 mount skin, 1 outfit and 1 glider, I would price it at 2000 gems tops. But for someone that package is real deal and every item make it worth.  If that gets game going forward I am not really care.
---
[Insert joke about GW2's endgame]
---
wtf why?
---
i can understand why the Dell/Alienware promotions are locked in the US for potential legal reasons.
---
What i don't understand is why the outfit is once again locked behind US citizens. Especially after last time when EU players weren't technically allowed to get it without circumventing your ip using a VPN after KFT changed the promotion. Just like now.
---
If they can give away such a shitty reward as a miniature egg, why not give the outfit too? Aren't both ingame items that Anet should be able to have control over?
---
 Hell why the miniature egg at all? It basically amounts to giving Alienware your personal info, just so you can have an incredibly shitty lootbox. I bet that even the best possible mini drop is worth &lt;50g. Even a single black lion key would be more attractive.
---
Thanks! Worth a check :)
---
It is severely disappointing that Anet continues to have these wonderful ideas and then abandons them. They could have added to Sun's Refuge every LS episode, and turn it into a quasi-home instance, but with non-node upgradables. Instead, it's a one-trick gimmick that has no use outside of achievements.
---
Pretty sure they said that last time.
---
Do people really shun characters like that?
---
I'm just going to point out, those numbers are out of date after yesterday's balance patch, and due to the fact that berserker can no longer use combustive shot (which was previously so good that you would purposefully use your heal skill to double cast it), could be quite inaccurate.
---
wtf why is the t-shirt for new registrations only?
---
Use a VPN, my dude.
---
I don't really get the whole thing about level scaling, I'm doing significantly more damage to enemies on lower level areas, and can handle champions that I couldn't even look at without being defeated when I was still leveling up
---
Just checking but you're sure [this pack](https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-heart-of-thorns-path-of-fire-us-43911) is more more expensive for you?
---
Marketing. The promotion is primarily targetted at Alienware Arena users that do not yet play Guild Wars 2, followed by Guild Wars 2 players who do not yet use Alienware Arena.

you should not be playing condi slb on any of these bosses if you care that much about the difference between sb and d/t tbh
---
...For a sec I was confused was I in the wrong reddit when I saw that pic, currently playing both GW2 and Final Fantasy 14 xD
---
Ironically, this seems like a nod to the Command Post in Nightfall which served similar purpose and was as useless as Sun's Refuge currently is. And also it was location almost at the same spot (actually right before the northern gate that leads to the inner sanctum of the refuge). 
---
Command Post, Hall of Monuments in GW, Home Instance and Sun's Refuge in GW2 fall in the same category: nice ideas that were never devellopped to the full extend of they potential and forever looked like a gimmick. At the the Hall of Monuments gave us something for GW2...
---
&gt; Mid strat was the BEST strat
---
please kill me
---
It's not meta, but it's fine. If you're decent at playing defensively, you should be okay.
---
I found most of the rotations quite simplistic. Then again I mostly played BLM with long casttimes and not much interesting going on rotation wise, just doing the exact same thing always while standing still a lot.
---
I did enjoy savage primals and raiding, but the grind to get to them took all the fun out of the game for me and I quit. Mandatory story, boring dungeons with insane queuetimes, non-functioning rotations until reaching max level just burnt me out so much I couldn't even enjoy the only good content.
---
Eh. Chrono's in a sad place because your utilities are always locked by 2 wells and SoI (so basically 2-boon-bannerslave), but people still are okay with chrono+druid, alarev and quickfb aren't really pushing them out, just give an alternative.   
---
As for bury, they're trying that for years now. At this point, don't worry. Unless they remove quickness/alacrity from you entirely, you're safe. Also, there's a respectable power DPS build for chrono (it can pump out 30+ish k dps assuming no perma uptime on Danger Time), so there's always something to statswap into if things really go sour.
---
thnx hero, dont quite understand why i had to restart chrome but that did the trick.
---
Used windscribe (free version) location washington.
---
If anyone wants to help a new player out and has excess transmutation charges, I wouldn't mind free charges!
---
My display name is:

Shadowsych.3462
---
Or they could just get rid of lootboxes altogether
---
copper one is a must
---
I've actually got 9 bowls of that sitting in my inventory for whenever I decide to go collect Lady Whisteria.
---
&gt; For the average pugger, you go with viable classes.
---
Oh really you believe so? Well then tell me when was the last time you saw a pug group that was looking for DPS for Twin Largos other than Mirage? 
---
People are just catching up how team composition works, most 'good' (~250LI) groups will force you to have best (or second best) in slot DPS class for given boss. At it's a good thing, because GW2 doesn't have vertical progression and making alts matter is a very good sign for the health of the game. I, myself have 4 condi specs, 3 power specs and 3 hybrid specs ready for raids. The problem begins when you hard stack a single power class for power encounters or a single condi class for condi encounters - and it's more and more prevelent thing. This means that some classes are so strong that they make other classes and their unique mechanics obsolete.
---
Haha. Also why I quit. Gw2 &lt;3
---
I think problem is that Renegade leads to Firebrand and Soulbeast which often isn't actually run by pugs. Technically you could probably play Chrono with Renegade nad the Chrono just stops supplying alacrity
---
Braham should have just went smh 😤😤
---
were you able to get the outfit code in Canada? I have no idea how this shit works, the links either direct to nothing, or asking me to Register (when I already have)
---
An hour ago, ArenaNet said that "There are still codes for Miniature Eggs available but [they're] investigating an issue where it shows the wrong message."
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/897339/#Comment_897339
---
Could be related. Historically, some AWA giveaways have restocked, I think.
---
I'll yell at the guy who decides who gets which keys, thanks.
---
That dog-thing be like: \*Dafuq am I doing here?\*
---
Look at how excited Aethila is!
---
Yes, I connected to a US TunnelBear VPN. You must register for a new account to get the outfit code, then go through all of the validation/account completion steps.
---
How does the outfit voucher work? Is it literally “pick an outfit” or is it a currency I need multiple of to actually get anything good?
---
*Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.*
---
And to think we all thought [this item](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Endless_Miniature_Tonic) was just a novelty.
---
I did create and register a new one, but apparently I would still require a VPN for literally any of it, so fuck it, not worth my time.
---
For the mini egg, try the link in [this tweet](https://twitter.com/GuildWars2/status/1121143197441384452). I couldn't find it either and I guess lots of other people were having issues too.
---
For the quests, it might be because you're outside of the US. When I go to the quests page to complete them, I get a pop up (differs for each quest, mostly you just click things inside of the pop up). For example,[for one of the quests I had to choose a few answers like which race "speaks to me."](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/254827756003524609/570693885798383626/awre.jpg?width=953&amp;height=609)
---
question: geomancy vs malice sigil ?
---
Installing TunnelBear and uninstalling it is pretty fast and painless. I'd say it's worth it.
---
Everyone needs to be very careful in this post. There are people pm'ing spoilers with every mention of this movie.
---
Just take out the black lion keys and lower the gem price a lottle for the people who have this.
---
What server are you on?
---
Will send you one here in a moment! :)
---
 I got my eggs for Bart!
---
i am not gonna create an account at awa for a lousy mini that i can just buy off the tp after finishing my daily
---
I've got a particular preference for Firebrand Guardian. I like the idea of the virtues and tomes and the visual flair they have.
---
Storyline is painful, nothing else.
---
anet as always been very shy and limited about modifying their engine or offering more customization options, so i doubt we will see anything worth mentioning on an already old game sadly
---
Where do you see the servers on gw2efficiency?
---
PvE perspective: Heal renegade is very strong. New Berserker works great for flavour; needs tiny bits of numbers tweaking or rotation changes but once that settles things should be fine.
---
No, I despise superheroes in tight, often spandex suits.
---
But I can't wait last episode of Season 4!
---
3 downvotes from idiots which trying to prove nothing and they already failed like anet with this rework. i hope reedit gona make visible every person which downvote or upvote something,like facebook. i whoud like word or two with you dumb ppl.
---
https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy
---
It is a high risk class, it only depends on how you play it. 
---
Personnaly i play deadeye with a lof of mobility instead of stealth, thus, i become unpredictable and i can kite my opponent. Perhaps i have like 11k health leaving me weak to any burst, but it's the risk of the class and i love it. 
---
I scare the opponent at the beginning of the fight so he wastes all his counter projectile skills and then i kite him as shooting him. 
---
It's a very funny gameplay and very original when you were playing backstab daredevil :)
---
But i can understand your opinions, most of the deadeye don't play like this, you can see it as they struggled to nerf the stealth 1...
---
I just think that the spe doesn't deserve so much hate :)
---
Yeah, died to it twice this weak at Thunderhead Keep (when the game caught up, I was at 50% health surrounded by branded mobs. I hope ANET fixes it.
---
Can you get the code multiple times..like for your friends?
---
Oh man... that would save me most of a bank tab...
---
And... keep with me now... a *bookshelf*... that you can put *books* in... that is not your bank...
---
Get ready for second Miniature Egg lads Pepega
---
Yeah, there's an archway underneath Tarir that always gives this effect, it's annoying when I'm trying to loot quickly and catch a spawn on a map elsewhere.
---
yeah but its open source so no shady code from this mod and anet will never ban for purely visual mods like these, no matter what they say
---
Already had an account, so it was a quick password reset for me and then a free egg. :D
---
I believe it was snowcrows.
---
Wait, you think bannerslaves should be condi berserkers still?
---
Oh wow. No wonder you're clueless.
---
But its FREE.... or is it? :&gt;
---
Thanks :) I really appreciate that.
---
Some more finetuning needed, but overall good changes for PvE.
---
People straight up sleeping on how the dye packs are absolutely the worst case of gambling box Anet offers. There's not even a guarantee you'll get 1 of the pack's new dyes. It's gross. They should definitely replace them for other countries but I wish they'd just completely change that bullshit in the first place.
---
&gt; the return of City of Heroes
---
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
---
Whoa.
---
BACK THE HELL UP.
---
What's this about a return of City of Heroes?
---
With other DHs you get retal by being in their gs4, right ?
---
Is the class able to play well if its the only source of retal in the squad in your experience ?
---
WvW has peak aka prime time depending where you are and your server. NA prime is 8pm and EU is the same. Your server has probably guilds running which also run their own raids alongside random pug commanders. Your best bet is to notice guild tags around or ask in team chat which guilds are your server’s and if you could join one etc. Unless your server is a Tier 4 one which stuff are pretty tight and dead there..
---
Right, so you tried to take my example of the ranged doing it when ranged are meta and change the conversation to be about that, and now you're trying to accuse me of moving the goalposts.
---
No orb clear is only the best strategy for comps that do not include a ranged character. People don't clear them in current comps because melee clearing it is too much of a dps loss.
---
Every single time ranged have been meta, the best strategy has been for the ranged characters to clear them. It's better to clear them that not, but it's not worth melee running to them.\]
---
soulbeast clearing the orbs is the BETTER STRATEGY. Clearing them with a ranged has always been superior to not clearing them which is superior to clearing them with a melee.
---
How much delay is reasonable ? Should I like, auto for 7-10 secs before it pops ?
---
Which cooldowns is it really important I save for the post breakbar burst ?
---
Old LA. Now im sad :(.
---
&gt;No orb clear is only the best strategy for comps that do not include a ranged character
---
Incorrect, no orb clear is the meta strategy.
---
\&gt;  the best strategy has been for the ranged characters to clear them
---
To which condi berserker lost no dps doing, so it always did it, while classes like staff weaver still lost dps orb clearing.
---
\&gt; Clearing them with a ranged has always been superior to not clearing them 
---
That's not meta, thats a pug strat. There's a difference.
---
The real issue tho is that anet is pushing more and more towards no classspecific buffs whether we like it or not. I think that there is a high rusk/chance of them changing banners to just pulse a boon and removing all the traits like spotter emp allies assassin's precense etc. I think this is a bad call but it seems that this is what we are getting
---
I'm not Belgian, so i've got no problems with it. :D 
---
Anet Should just add non rng options that are compliant with the law tho tbh.
---
Yeah, it prolly includes cleave, which gets in the way of accurate numbers, whai I mainly meant was that even though I can't realistically get 32k like the bench, I want to tryhard and reach 85-90% of that in as many realistic scenarii as possible
---
It's minion Voltron!
---
Really, we're going to do that now? I guess since Murica apparently counts as 50 countries, there are actually 244 countries on the planet, not 195. Are we going to count each German state as a separate country too?
---
sounds like this can be boiled down to the fact that you just don't want to like GW2.  you want to like WoW.  that's okay, but go play WoW.
---
Oh no you just got cyberbullied! You should do a thread so sjw will cheer you up because you can't do it yourself!
---
In the time it took to do all that and enter the code you still probably could have done anything in-game and gotten more, but at least you got the suspense of *possibly* getting something worthwhile!
---
This event was awesome... I'm sad it's not a recurring event.
---
AGREED! I want my character to be using flashy/awesome effects, but I sure as hell don't want other's effects destroying my eyes &gt;..&gt;
---
&gt;Incorrect, no orb clear is the meta strategy.
---
 Incorrect, no ranged is the meta strategy. Which means no orb clear. You do no orb clear BECAUSE  you have no range, not becuase it's actually better.
---
There has never been a meta where ranged are part of the comp that did not have the ranged clear the orbs. Because it's not better to have ranged characters and ignore them.
---
No im posting this for people to see what this person is and 1% chance anet to do something.
---
There's a special action skill to kill yourself, or you can just bleed out until you're defeated. If you keep using Bandage, of course you're never going to die unless someone hits you.
---
Also, you didn't link a screenshot.
---
Everytime I read war eternal 1st thing come to my mind is fissure of woe.
---
Reminds me of some minecraft shenanigans where you can set any number of creatures to "ride" on one anothers head.
---
So you can have a Zombie riding a cow riding a Ghast riding a spider riding a villager riding a Minecart riding a Bat.
---
[WoW did it first!](https://i.imgur.com/dZhda9I.png)
---
Happy to help you out in-game with WvW and explain how it all works!
---
If you want anet to do something about it report it in game when it happens. If you dont tell them directly there is little they can do. Also your link isnt working. 
---
also also. pvp brings out the worst in people you should try to develop a thicker skin for little things like this (spamming a finisher move) or you are going to be tilted forever.
---
No we are really Logan just pretending to be Aurene
---
If you can figure it out be sure to let me know. Under the information it says you had to already have a dell rewards, according to alienware I do, but when I tried to sign into dell rewards with my alienware info (they are the same company) it said no account exited so I had to make a new account. Making that new account, I signed up for dell rewards but couldn't actually login, it just kept bringing me back to the sign up page even when logged in.
---
I also couldn't find anyway either through the sites or through searching to connect your alienware and dell accounts if they are different. Only thing I found is that alienware gives the credit to your dell account but I made my dell account after even though alienware said I had a rewards so honestly I have no idea if it's going to show up or what. 
---
Alienwares site also says it can take 30 days for credit to show up so I'm going to just check again in a week and hope that maybe it's there.
---
Nice, congrats! I've gotten some okay pulls from Toy Mini Eggs (20g a most?) in the past but I only got three 5s minis from this promo.
---
So because it took me longer than I care to admit to find out what the hell Alienware Arena even *is* (this is my first time hearing about it), here's the description from their [About page](https://na.alienwarearena.com/about), in case anyone else wants to actually know what they're signing up for:

YES i was there and playing in the weekend! and just earlier today! dm me and ill send you info!
---
All sent!
---
I ran frostfire too! Maybe we were in the same team who knows!! so happy to be back though :D Are you in the discord?
---
A fellow SUPERHEROO!!!
---
Same here I have also been playing it the last 4-5 days, nice break from GW2!
---
instead of reinventing wheel,by most demented way,they shoud just remove whole berserker stance and make it BASIC BURST WHICH YOU CAN USE ON NORMAL CD. just stop with this fucking gimmick +2 sec + 5 sec+ 2 sec +1 sec.
---
The squad!
---
It’s literally one letter. And look up the definition of redundant.
---
I really liked the Heavensward story, but the base game story and the quests are *terrible*.
---
These settings are to a tee exactly the ones Colin Johanson promised, together with a return of the skill visuals nerfed in HoT. He left the company before this could be realized.
---
that headset thooooo
---
This bullshit just reinforces my abstinence from the gemstore, still going strong since wintersday, thanks for saving me money ANet!
---
Is it wrong to hope we can recover Blish's consciousness and adapt it into even more adorable Fennec form? 
---
I would greatly enjoy a fuzzy portal specialist.
---
You are not along. Used to use xmouse to help me with limited success.
---
1 voucher = 1 outfit
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Lion_Voucher_Dealer#Outfits
---
Faren: "Not to worry, Commander. I'll SHORTLY have this UNDERtaking accomplished."
---
Depends on the server you are on and what time of the day and in what region. Hard to tell without that info.
---
Use free vpn like hide me vpn and get it anyway.
---
&gt;!Blish was able to imbue his soul into a fennec fox from the mists, horray! !&lt;
---
I wouldn't necessarily see their form of balance as a good thing though. Where GW2 tries to aim for differentiating classes, FFXIV's aim has ever been "You can do everything with every class because in essence they are all catered to play the same". 
---
Both mindsets give you different can of worms, but FFXIV is hitting a spot where YoshiP himself is stating a problem with the mostly static healer and tank balancing that needs to be changed, and I personally much prefer the GW2 approach, because it allows for far more flexibility.
---
I love both games though.
---
This is true. The creator released d912pxy with performance log uploader code and was closed source because the code was messy. After the outcry, the creator open sourced the code for review and removed the uploader code. People are downvoting because they never heard the update to the story. 
---
If you want high framerates, this addon delivers, but the con is that it also breaks support for gw2hook, and has some graphical glitches.
---
I sure do hope so! I do want that outfit, I've been playing religiously for years and giving them money; it might be just an outfit in a game but it still feels kind of shitty. VPN isn't working for me either for whatever reason. Knowing me I'm probably doing something wrong but I've been at it for over an hour and just given up. Hope everyone who does get the outfit enjoys it at least! :D
---
But what if you were already registered/already have an acct? How do you go about getting an outfit?
---
I'm so glad I managed to snatch one, lady luck was with me and I got a mini that was worth a full 7s as a sell order (4s buy orders).
---
seriously, NA gets their otherwise unobtainable t-shirt, EU gets something with an average worth of a few silver. it's Kung Fu tea all over again - remind me, where was the EU specific giveaway back then?
---
at some point these lazy, country specific promotions are gonna do more harm than good. if they knew Alienware was gonna be NA only, why not find an EU partner immediately?
---
Register again with a new email address and username.
---
i've watched this so many times, I love this thread
---
Ad then proceed to fail and die due to bad DPS lol.
---
will do! Cheers
---
Well from an American's point of view everything was easy and quick. I have been wanting the Dragon Emblem Outfit for so long and all it took was me registering. It's definitely a step up from Kung Fu Tea which didn't work for me one bit. Anet is taking a step in the right direction, now to help our European bros.
---
I would hold off on any changes till the builds are updated for the patch from yesterday. [There are some early tests with power berserker](https://youtu.be/j3dxHjtXBBg) now and that may be the go to build, still a little early to say what the best setup is though.
---
So what you are saying is that you would GW2 to be like other MMO were you will stay level 80 and then go to a lvl 5 area kill everything just by blowing air at them and one shot world bosses (as you can in other mmo's) to make sure the low level players get a chance to even hit it. Because this makes you feel powerful?
---
How about you go to expansion area and start dealing with the mobs there and actaully learn how to play and use your skills. Becuase that is what you get from GW2. Skillbased. And if you don't have it or learn it your gear means shit. As it should be. What should matter is that you get better at the game and learn. Not that you gank with your gear.
---
With that logic there's no purpose to running Druid with Chrono, since it totally defeats the purpose of running Chrono in fractals. Pugs do it anyway.
---
Pugs are gonna use what pugs use, and I third the sentiment above that mediocre FB/Ren groups in my experience are smoother than Chrono/Druid groups.
---
Don't understate the value of:
---
* much higher stability output
---
* the sheer amount of CC Renegade brings to the table + that of a warrior which pugs also use - with how CC intensive fractals are, after the chrono nerfs... 
---
* much simpler alacrity output and more frequent quickness output - no reliance on wells or tides of time, and somewhat less reliant on prestacking to actually maintain boons
---
* far greater heals than that of a druid from either FB or Ren
---
Yes, running either as a healer defeats the purpose... the purpose - for the hardcore players - is the much greater DPS. For your average pug group? Nowadays I think I rather see them run FB/Ren than Chrono. Because - even casually - I think they have much better toolboxes that help carry your average group so much more than Chrono and Druid ever did. Especially now that 🦀 GoE is gone. 🦀 
---
I can't blame pugs for not running Chrono as often, now that it's not as strong alone for 5 man parties any more. It has portals, and a bunch of utility - sure. But portals - that's stuff a group with a healer probably won't be using to begin with.
---
Ah damn glad I wasnt around at the time, that sucks man
---
Aurene became a Fennec fox ...
---
ok cool
