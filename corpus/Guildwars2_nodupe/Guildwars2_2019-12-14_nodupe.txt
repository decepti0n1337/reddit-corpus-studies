NA is literally America - tipping is theoretically voluntary, but if you don't tip enough, people will spit in your food, shit on your doormat, and slander you online.

Imagine a guy wanting to raid but all things are 20000 KP please. He knows the fight but not that much as he hasn't raided to much. Made some few mistakes, gets block listed by raiders. And people wonder why raiding community is lowering when getting into it is either be good or get block.
---
You will be sorely missed Eris, i will always miss the good 'ol days of reset static to get instances. Downstate weaver won't be the same without you yelling at me to stop that.

Unfriend them and see if they're in your "Followers" list. Then friend them back. Or don't, that'll teach them!
---
There is a "Followers" tab on your Y panel. These are people who have friended you.
---
Will add everyone in due time I’ve just been a little busy these past few days :&gt;
---
if theyre offline you can see the achievement points etc. of those that have added you aswell
---
&gt;Uhm, no it wasn't.
---
To me it was, big enough to make me lose the little of interest that I had on the story of the game...Aesgir wasnt this badass Norn choosen of the spirits or whatever, reason why he was able to damage the dragon, he was just a guy with a magic scrool...wow, that is really more interesting and fun...the whole prophecy of the norn hero that would harm the tooth and lead the norn once again against Jormag was just made up bullshit...and now Jormag actually let Aesgir run...why did the Spirits died again? They werent buying time keeping Jormag busy so the norn could run away south? But its said on the journal that Jormag let Aesgir and the norn escape...
---
"\[...\] I could return to my village with the fang. Present it as proof a dragon  can be harmed. And then lead them south, to safety. Jormag wouldn't  follow, the voice said.\[...\]"
---
 "\[...\]The voice spoke true. I'll carry this burden for as long as I live. I  only hope whoever takes it up when I'm gone can handle the weight of it.  "
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
This whole thing makes no sense...to me this not only bad, but really boring writing, they literally took all the cool elements of the race and left then naked without anything going on for then, maybe thats the goal, Norns should be just giant humans that just get drunk and talk shit all the time.
---
not sure where the salt is from but I dont harass people that did not tip me for an instance
---
FF14 sub fee.
---
What if I truly made my KPs but my dps is sub-optimal?  
---
Your Mad King says: ponder!
---
\&gt; "You're arguing *very clearly* in bad faith and are upset that your gross joke got you banned." 
---
No part of this is accurate. I wasn't banned. I received a suspension. The joke was tasteful, not gross. Being kink-related is not "gross," but I understand it's not to everyone's taste. If you're going to say kink is "gross," I will point out that you're just as bigoted as anyone who would say homosexuality is "gross." 
---
\&gt; "You didn't post that because you suffered from a paraphilia, which by the way if someone with a paraphilia posted the same thing as a result of their paraphilias, is still Their fault which they'd still be banned."
---
This is just as bigoted as it is inaccurate. Again, I was suspended, not banned.
---
\&gt; "It's not discrimination in any way shape or form and you know that."
---
It *is discrimination*, because it's the ostensible application of a rule, when the rule was not violated. It's application of a bias against kink, because some people find it distasteful. It's like not permitting someone to eat at your lunch counter, because they're not your race. You just don't like *that kind of person*, so you treat them badly. It's the very definition of discrimination.
---
you are dumb-shaming yourself
---
Well, I'll say this for your comment: you're living up to your username.
---
So you were trying to be funny, edgy and pushing the boundaries of what could be considered a bannable offense, then you got caught and went on a childish rampage claiming any and all bullshit you could pull out of your ass, then came to reddit to appeal to the masses when you are clearly in the wrong. Good luck.
---
Followers are only people you didn't add as friend, but they added you. If it is mutual or you added them only then it is on friends list.
---
amazing advice full of foresight!
---
so you're implying one should remember at least 49 names(per train run nonetheless)? all this assuming people don't just join for 1 hero point then get replaced by someone new increasing that number further!
---
oh and now the best part! what if you recognize the name but that person STILL wanted to grief you for whatever reason? maybe they asked a question and you replied in a manner they found rude or any other reason to fuck with you
---
i mean the 2nd example is a guy banning their friend as a joke so yea..
---
I'm glad you're amused, but just keep in mind that if rules can be enforced unevenly, inconsistently, and in a discriminatory manner against people you dislike, they can be enforced unevenly, inconsistently, and in a discriminatory manner against people you like. Today, it's me. Tomorrow, it could be you, your friend, or a member of your guild. Discrimination isn't something at which we should laugh. Discrimination should be discouraged.
---
I think OP secretly enjoyed that and the whole messages exchange with support
---
&gt;I posted the following tongue-in-cheek message, which I intended to be both humorous** and a little suggestive**
---
grats someone picked up on the suggestion
---
all i want is for this trash company to get its shit together
---
So all this whinging, all this outrage and righteous indignation is over a 4 day ban? Just take a 4 day vacation from the game and learn from it.
---
I'd rather OP shared their username so we could just add to our block list and kick whenever they show up in squads/parties. They don't seem like a very pleasant person to play with
---
you're not explaining shit, you're just justifying a bad build that nobody should really play..in a way that strangely reminds me of gish galloping
---
but i give up! and i'm honestly looking forward to more of your carry builds such as: autoattack only DH, power "turn brain off and mash buttons" scourge, maybe some condi spellbreaker abomination?
---
btw you should look into woodenpotato's open world builds for inspiration, you both seem to have a similar perspective on the game
---
You're a horny creepass who got banned for a week, chill the fuck out.
---
&gt;Ultimately what matters is that Anet said no and you still did it.
---
That is *not at all* what happened. ArenaNet did not expressly or explicitly prohibit the mere suggestion of kink-related discussion. Read the rule. There is nothing in the Rules of Conduct or Terms of Service prohibiting what I said! 
---
The rest of your argument is just as wrong as the portion quoted above. You need to pick up a copy of the DSM-5 and do your homework. It also wouldn't hurt you to hit up the website for the [National Coalition for Sexual Freedom](https://www.ncsfreedom.org/). They have educational resources from which you would benefit.
---
&gt; what if you recognize the name but that person STILL wanted to grief you for whatever reason?
---
In these cases, the gold isn't directly coming from the folks in a Hero Point train - it isn't coming from their accounts or characters. It comes from an third party gold seller. 
---
But, if they accept gold from a gold seller first, then they would be the one to get banned. You may receive a warning, but it's unlikely.
---
So, yeah, advice still stands. Don't recognize the name? Don't accept. It really isn't that hard. And if you do accept on accident or without knowing, submit a ticket immediately so you don't get flagged.
---
&gt;Kids play this game, that's why they ban stupid shit like this.
---
First of all, whether or not "shit like this" is "stupid," is a matter of opinion. Second of all, I wouldn't expect "kids" to get the innuendo in what I said any more than they would get all the innuendos in Shrek, and other programming to which kids are exposed, these days. This is a silly position to take. This had nothing to do with protecting kids; it's just prudish.
---
[removed]
---
Yes you are and perhaps even subconsciously because instead of understanding that some behavior is socially unacceptable and by breaking it you have to face consequences, you went full nuclear with this defense by what's most ridiculous for me, trying to bring down your fetishes to the same level as it would be a sexual orientation - don't even try to spin this around, because I'm not interested. You clearly enjoyed the whole situation and went full meta with you kink fetish. 
---
If your post history is real then for fucks sake, you're 37... Whether you like it or not, living in a society requires following some rules - even if you don't like these, even if sometimes things seems to be not fair.
---
Many thanks from \[oRly\], we'll miss you Eris
---
Well, it's not for everyone, and that's okay. Still, a 96-hour suspension is unwarranted by the fact that one's taste in humor may differ from mine. The point is that no rule was broken, yet a 96-hour suspension was handed down.
---
You're a moron.
---
Working as intended
---
I was asking because I am gathering evidence to make the case to anet that they should consider taking a look at and raising the abysmally low guild hall local area deco limit. Not sure why you guys are downvoting I’m literally trying to help everyone lol.
---
&gt; But majority of players/group kicks you or read description. 
---
Can't agree here. 
---
When I started raiding I joined groups that wanted more LI than I had very often. I told them about my LI and asked if I can stay. Some groups said that they will kick my, if I'm too bad, but absolutely every groupe gave me that chance. 
---
Same when I was in raid groups and another player joined with the same thing. The commanders always let them stay for at least one try.
---
This guy 💝💝

Small tip: when blue circles spawning and are about to teleport you away, you can hear a specific *charging* sound. This way you don't have to be paranoid 24/7. Hear the sound? Look around and walk/dodge away, then carry on.
---
I'm gay. I'm in the BDSM community. Holding hands with my bf while walking down the street is inherently different from rigging him in our sex-swing and wheeling it down the road in front of people. If you can't fathom the difference than you're willfully blind, or simply stupid. Either way, you're a disgrace to kinksters. Enjoy your ban.
---
I don't disagree, but anet took it very differently. It's been noted that if tournaments were to happen again, they want some way to manage player playtimes in a way to try and prevent no-lifing the event which was seen as the major primary problem in post.
---
[I don't know why but playing this while reading this post is gold.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag1o3koTLWM)
---
I was waiting for this post!
---
Just because I've shown you that your Quickness only build vs My build is an unbalanced comparison and that you're wrong about just about every argument about the build, doesn't mean I haven't explained anything. It just means that you don't want to accept it. 
---
Unlike AA only DH, Scourge and Condi Spellbreaker, this build is actually comparable, within 37% of 50% BD Chrono and &lt;200% more boon generation. Where as those builds would bring nothing new to the group and closer to a 70% DPS loss. You really gotta work on your comparisons my friend. Next you'll be telling me that Condi Weaver is bad because Condi Soulbeast can Stance Share. Completely irrelevant of eachother. 
---
I didn't explain anything did I?
---
I explained how boon overcapping does actually benefit the opposite subgroup. You said it Doesn't. I explained how you should compare build that generate the same boons, rather than a lopsided comparison which you tried to hand out. I explained how the DPS is comparable (within 7k DPS) when you once again tried to compare it to a Quickness only build. You originally said that the DPS was potato, which it's not hence being able to get 11.5k w/ IA. |
---
Everything you have stated is inherently wrong. Would you like me to explain anything further?
---
KP and LI is stupid anyway.
---
&gt; After reviewing the incident in question we will not be overturning your account action.

So where is the gameplay? Shes talking about a game. Why isnt she showing the game?
---
Yes, the quaggan hat is adorbz.
---
Ok so firstly, being gay does not preclude you from being an incel lmao. 
---
Secondly, evaluate why you have such a negative reaction to women who put on nice makeup, do their hair and wear a shoulderless top for a special video. Oh, and stream clips wearing t shirts and a sweater. Because that's literally all there is here, unless I'm somehow missing the part where she twerks in booty shorts for chat donations whilst pretending to pick something up off the floor, or whatever the fuck happens on twitch nowadays.
---
That's not what I meant with "original" hence the quotes. I was specifying SPECIFICALLY between ESO and GW 2 and it wasn't at all either a serious accusation.
---
I am well aware, as an avid gamer that prefers fantasy genres, that elementals are not anything new.
---
In all honesty, from a fairness perspective, I'd advise you try each race at least once. I forget how many character slots you have, but there are &gt;!bits of later stories that change depending on your character race!&lt;(not really a huge spoiler, but I tagged it just in case). As for *starter* race, I'm personally a huge fan of the diminutive Asura - they're smol sciencegremlins- but what you pick to start out is largely going to A) not matter, and B) depend on what you wanna be looking at for the next few hours of your GW2 career. For example, I hate the way Charr and male Norn move - they feel entirely too lumbering and slow to me - whilst some people hate the way Asura move (rats on crack, I think I've heard them called). 
---
A few things to note about the differences between races (or lack thereof):
---
* The *biggest* difference is in the low-level story. **Again, some slight spoilers here**. 
---
   * Asura are all about magitech, fighting the "just evil enough that we don't invite them to dinner parties" Inquest, and some weird politics with the asuran government.
---
   * Charr are all about honoring the legions, dealing with past dishonors to the legions, and generally being a good soldier
---
   * Norn are mainly about proving their legend. In GW1, this was very pronounced - Norn would literally not even talk to you until you proved that you could beat them in a fight - but it's been toned down since then. If you remember the Sovngarde characters in Skyrim, Norn are kinda that same mindset.
---
   * Humans are... middle of the road. They don't like centaurs, and centaurs don't like them. They like their gods tho, so that's cool.
---
   * Sylvari are based largely on Arthurian legend, mixed with the naïveté of a race that is only 25 years old. Expect a lot of discovering what is righteous, and sometimes ignoring that. 
---
* Races do actually move at the same speed, in terms of distance covered per unit time. However, since a max-sized male Norn is obviously a lot bigger than a min-sized female asura, the asura will flap her little footsies a lot faster than the male norn will stomp his feet.
---
* There is generally no major advantage, gameplay-wise, to one race over the other. There are racial skills, but they're generally agreed to be extremely weak. As a (perhaps bad) comparison, the Human-only "Prayer to Kormir" skill and the warrior "Signet of Stamina" skill have the same cast time and recharge, but while the human one removes 3 conditions (and that's it), the Warrior one removes *twelve* conditions, and also increases how often you can dodge while not actively being used.
---
* Asura are best tho. Because asura master race &lt;3
---
She is? .\_\_\_\_\_\_. She's talking about her journey throughout her first year of the game, and showing us relevant clips/memories. If it were a video guide on how to do Dhuum, or something, then I would agree with your last comment.
---
Why doesnt she show clips of her journey? Shes still talking about a game
---
Read it again, the person you replied to said they wanted OP’s account name so they could block *them* saying that they don’t want to play with OP
---
She does, though? She shows multiple different clips of her playing pvp, playing wvw, trying out different classes, learning raids, and iirc some open world, too.
---
Right at the end for 10 seconds...
---
&gt; I'd rather OP shared **their** username so we could just add to our block list and kick whenever **they** show up in squads/parties. **They** don't seem like a very pleasant person to play with
---
Okay, so either you skipped through the video and missed the other clips, or I'm living in a parallel universe with a different video, because there's undoubtedly more than 1 lol
---
If you can afford it, there’s no reason not to. But I’m not sure how often it goes on sale, or when it will next ho on sale. 
---
The story is better than core, for what that’s worth (bit of a low bar, I suppose). Playing LWS2 will also help in understanding what’s happening in HoT. It’s a decent chunk of story you’d be missing otherwise. If you care about story, good and bad, it’s still worth it.
---
It’s also an easy source of **8** Core Tyria Mastery Points - that alone is underrated in how useful it is. Also, you can make Mawdrey and Mawdrey II - one is an ascended backpiece (but I’d note: ascended backpieces are much easier to get from s3 maps!) and the other is a bloodstone dust eater.
---
This is not accurate. It’s more in the 45-55g range per piece.
---
No, but if you do win you'll get the rewards faster. I was garbage when i first started pvp and it took a while but it was a lot more fun than I was expecting and after a few seasons i am now in gold 2-3 tier and actually competitive.
---
But the other guy talks about "them", plural. How could he talk about OP in plural?
---
The 100g per piece thing stated elsewhere is not accurate. You can check out https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/ascended for cost breakdowns. Normally will be more like 40-60g.
---
Idk why you’re so invested in this but https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they
---
It used to be, but it’s not that much of a savings anymore. By the time you buy the other recipes (alternative armor recipe and insignia recipe) and calculate in the mystic forge costs, in most cases it’s so close now that I find it not worth it. 
---
You can use https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/ascended to break it down and compare.
---
Thats so sad i wouldve loved to know about that during regular gameplay.
---
Ooooh, almost. Based on a video of a guy walking around LA on Youtube, there was a swastika near the portals. [https://youtu.be/tp2g6WwlJ18?t=226](https://youtu.be/tp2g6WwlJ18?t=226)
---
This was my way to get ascended diviner set. Just crafting that God for saken armor normally is so much time wasting. Other than that idk if its efficient or not
---
I'm losing brain cells trying to figure out your sentence structures.
---
It'll do this regardless. Not sure if it's always been there, but it is now.
---
If they add you, you can see the rest of the info.
---
You can cancel the end animation of Guardian's symbols if you stow your weapon. It's useful for your dps rotation which saves you a couple from waiting for the animation to end.
---
Run now before it's too late.
---
Not really a tip/trick for any particular class as it *was* mainly a camera "exploit"  (stressing "was" as it's now been removed), but for thief you used to be able to dagger 2 in place when you moved your camera in the same (or opposite, can't remember) direction as your leap.
---
This effectively increased your stealth duration as you were able to fit more leaps into your smoke field (leap + combo field). 
---
I used to do this all the time when I mained PvP. Good times.
---
Can't speak to the implants, but these are not Sylvari statues.
---
Note that still requires you to have 500 crafting to make the marks, so some think you might as well make the armor the normal way. 
---
After getting full ascended armor for T4s and running those, my group went into learning raids, and I've gotten way more ascended drops from there, its very common.
---
Also, raids don't require ascended armor so you don't need to worry about that. You will do more damage from learning the fight's mechanics better, or knowing how to play your class well.
---
If you are interested, take a look at [https://snowcrows.com/](https://snowcrows.com/) for good builds and a link to the Raid Academy training discord.

Warrior banners don’t disappear properly
---
Exactly that, if someone has a full-cleared wing they can respawn any boss in that wing to clear again.
---
A majority of MMOs have a friends list that you have to mutually agree to add someone to.  GW2 is just "Oh I'll add this person." with no notification to the other that you've ever added them.  And then they tab into their follower's list to find someone they've been playing with and it's 600 players big.  That's the problem.  You don't need any of those other things you've listed if adding people was a mutual endeavor since you've access to 5 guilds that can be used to do such things already (High level PvE, PvP, WvW, RP, etc).
---
Now that's big brain. I respect.

Except you wouldn't be able to bannerspam because the local decoration limit is restrictive as fuck.

It's mostly server lag. Though a powerful pc helps, and especially a powerful cpu since gw2 is a cpu heavy game. There are options to improve fps, there are options to turn down the amount of players loaded, and to not show character skins. Though it will always be crappie, especially in eb since the gameservers can't handle that many people in a tight spot. The good part is you can feel the battle coming since you will start lagging.
---
UN headquarter?
---
This is my current build too, I use a snow owl merge for the leap and the heal...that heal has saved my butt many times. I used to run scourge but the roaming SB is my favorite by far. There is nothing like being able to just nope right out of a situation with the F1 leap, F2 swiftness and GS Swoop and repeat.

Yup, LA is a crazy melting pot of different cultures. Asura there who are less obsessed with science and progress and try their hand at farming and merchantry, Sylvari who don't care about the dream or the nightmare and try their hand at being pirates, Charr and humans

so why is it on these meta maps there's bunches of banners all stacked in one point, so I can only claim one bonus.
---
you can tell they're stacked coz clipping and names
---
As the comments pointed out in the old topic - the results will not represent the game's population - reddit is maybe like 5% of the whole player base, not only that, it tends to bring together rather specific type of people.

Nevertheless, surveys done.

Why exactly?

The first line should just be "~~viewing the~~ banners in aerodrome."

You don't mean the [mossman](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Mossman) right?

So if I play 2 accounts and pass gold from the alt account to the main, I can be banned?
---
nice :L)
---
Actually this is incorrect as I'm the person that made the banner in the picture. How it was done was simply patience. The banner will overlap if you don't place is correctly and it will not default to the edge if you misplaced it. As you can see there is one random battle standard and if the map is still accessible another line of banner of strength and defense where the distance is slightly off. This is because there was two person that tried to help without understanding how to place it and don't realize the repetition of the banners pattern. The whole process took 4 hours with me alone placing the banner and 2 alacrigade standing besides me. I rely on the line of the mystic forge as point of reference to make a perfect circle and the warrior symbol when you try to put the banner to get accurate distance between two banners.

You might want to change your graphics settings a bit or get a better pc if you want people to watch your videos. The framerate is way too low to enjoy watching this.

as for entertainment, well if we'll get wvw tournaments i may consider upgrading my gear.  thanks though for that advise. =)

Nice banners, sadly the forge itself is asymmetrical on the ground (light part vs dark circle around it)

And no, this is not attention to detail. This is stupid design.
---
Done, please post results when you're done.
---
No. RMT gold comes from accounts associated with third-party gold sellers. Assuming that your alt account does not work for a gold seller, its gold is clean.
---
Additionally, if ArenaNet wanted to ban you for some reason, they would ban all of your accounts at the same time, as well as any accounts that have logged in from the same PC or network as yours. So, if you got sent RMT gold on your main account, both of your accounts would get banned.
---
Just saw something in a thread asking about game performance which made me question something.
---
If you set the detail settings in-game to "auto-detect" does it scale the settings up and down while you're playing the game? So, like, the settings would lower when you're in Palawadan but go higher in a solo instance without you having to do/change anything?
---
Or does it just measure your performance at the instant you select the option, and use *that* the whole time?
---
Cool stuff I wished I knew much sooner for thief:
---
Thief wall/high ground jumps/teleports. A crap ton of those spots everywhere, from core tyria to bjora keep. Doable with mesmer blink as well, except thief can spam it with SB5.
---
I'm not joking, in WvW EB, you can literally shadowstep from the red keep to the edge of a cliff, or up some hills equivalent to a full charge T3 springer jump. (Won't work in JPs)
---
SB4 consistenly interrupts enemies channel. Very good against mobs with channeling attacks without a breakbar.
---
S/D or S/P 3 has a short evade frame. Can be paired with traits that rewards evades like Swindler's Equilibrium or Upper Hand from Acrobatics trait. Practiced right and you'll be sustaining in fights much longer.

Not as long as you got that gold by playing the game or converting gems to gold. If you bought that gold from a third party seller for cash or someone did and then sent it to any of your accounts you might get banned.

would be nice if in glunt rev twas jormag not glint talkin
---
Yeah, man, especially Tangled Depths is just something else. I've been there a hundred times and still have no idea how to navigate this 3D labyrinth.
---
Depends of node. For ascended cooking its bounty. For rest, its mostly volatile magic or crucible/industry.
---
Who pooped in your spaghetti?
---
Personally the one with AoE Gathering, but that might be just QoL to some. Makes gathering stuff like flax and wood extremely fast.
---
I think it came with the skyscale harvesting sickle.
---
The quickness-while-gathering is quite useful if you're often harvesting in areas with lots of mobs because you can gather before they engage and mount back up to move away.
---
Habe never heard of this, thank you really much
---
Nooo anet it's not bug. 'If it works dont fix it'!!
---
Accept that all things pass.
---
Yes, but Dishonored is better.
---
Tangled Depths and Draconis Mons are two of the bests zones of the whole game, imo. There's nothing like them in any game out there, sans a few single player platformers.
---
Imagine a whole MMO built following the design philosophy of those two. Imagine a whole dwarven underground city like that. Yeah, navigation could be better here and there, as could content, but I blame the deadlines more than the core design.
---
It's so sad to see ArenaNet leave the types of content that made GW2 unique behind. PoF was a big step backwards in zone design; don't get me wrong, they're great, but not as great as what came before.
---
TL;DR: Wasted potential.
---
I still remember the [Molachev Cocktail](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Molachev_Cocktail) invasion, but couldn't find any screenshots of it :I.
---
No, dipshit - it needs to be fixed.  We shouldn't have to change our display preferences on account of ArenaNet's oversight and players' mental disabilities.
---
Yeah it said "Lactating Tomatoes" i have no idea who or what that is, but these banner arts are evrywhere \^\^
---
[Yep](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/649007968724975638/655247233104740363/unknown.png).
---
It def changed. Rifle deadeye does a ton of dps but the rotation is far from brainless. You mess up 1 thing and youre fucked. That being said, thief is one of the meta raid classes and defi itely playable
---
Specially, don't use longbow 5 then longbow 4.
---
I want to kill myself every time I see that, and it happens way more often than what I'd like to.
---
Here, have a list of what I've observed as to why that website has been stagnating for the past few months.
---
* Drama between players, guilds  or otherwise
---
* Exclusive Cliques that make up rules for public spaces then ban you ICly for when you unwittingly break one of these rules
---
* Lack of any ability to criticize guilds or a player's OC on the forums to help them keep in line with the lore
---
* Overbearing mods on the forum that also don't play the game anymore
---
On ANet's side of things there's these:
---
* lack of ingame support for roleplay.
---
* Lackluster chat interface that can only have up to 5 tabs reliably
---
* Character limit of 199 characters
---
* /E and /Emote can't  be set as the default chat option
---
* No way to change the chat color.  You're stuck trying to read gray text on a darker gray background.
---
* Very few new emotes
---
* Very few roleplay friendly aesthetics
---
* Hardly any home customization
---
So in short, drama between players with ANet seemingly ignoring this side of the community in what's already a minority of players causes them to cannibalize themselves or leave to other games.  However, the website is still used to announce events, and there is a GW2RP discord server, that is actually ran by people who play the game on the regular.  There's still some RP to be had if you know where to look.
---
I can also only speak for the NA side of things, I've no idea what's going on in EU aside from it's already shot itself in the foot, so to speak.
---
Judging from the amount of people still watching this torture today, it seems to be entertainment for at least some. Maybe more about fame&amp; money for the fighter, but I wouldn't know
---
Its good on many raid bosses, but for fractals and wvw zergs there are better choices. 
---
Smallscale wvw is fine, but i wouldn‘t recommend thief for big zerg fights.
---
Problem with thief is, there are many classes that offers More support with same or More dps. But if u know how to play, your dps should be fine to clear every Pve content. 
---
Maybe some fractal groups will Look for specific classes and don‘t wanna have a thief, so your search will take a bit longer.
---
&gt; but take a character slowly, on foot, and play them as they were meant to be played first
---
Which is a huge time investment that many players just don’t have. A significant chunk of the player base was very unhappy with this expansion for this reason. It’s like ArenaNet tried to artificially increase the longevity of the expansion by cutting you off of 90% of it unless you invested X number of hours, and once you’ve done that you’re actually playing the expansion. 
---
&gt; They’re really a marvel of level design I think, as there are so many interesting places within their depths to discover.
---
I don’t think too many people stuck around long enough to discover those depths, because the barrier to entry is so high.
---
If you're barely going to show game content, at least show more nudity.
---
Any condi necro can use an amazing combo of poison cloud and epidemic during for example last boss of snowblind. First, you cast cloud on the boss so everyone can stack there being protected by projectile destroy for 8sec. Before it ends you cast epidemic to destroy all ice turrets.
---
Those are breast bones
---
MBTI has been debunked for not being very useful, FYI.
---
why do you look like Shreck ?
---
Draconis Mons is hot garbage because it makes the minimap even more useless than TD.
---
TD also had a lot of issues on the minimap, but at least it was somewhat usable.
---
DM was abslutely 100% worse than any of the core HoT maps.
---
I've yet to meet a gay incel. I think you underestimate how easy sexual engagements are for gay people. Anyone can correct me if I'm wrong, but I'll be damned if I EVER find a gay incel.
---
Secondly, having critique on female gamers trying to manipulate their male audiences by showing excessive nudity is a fair point of critique. I've yet to see a lot of shirtless male gamers trying to show off their bodies in order to attract a bigger audience. Most regular people just know how to dress up appropriately in the current age, especially when you know how many people are opposed to females trying to use their bodies to attract larger audiences. 
---
This just seems like a hackless attempt to appear "cutesy" and "adorable" without bringing anything substantive to the table.
---
They never had that issue in GW though. In fact they scrapped Utopia (the expansion after Nightfall) to create GW2, which then caused them to make Eye of the North to bridge the gap between the 2 games. The expansion model was always good for them in that game, so it can’t be a flaw with the expansion model itself. It must be a problem with the time it takes for them to make expansions in GW2, or limitations with the game’s mechanics.
---
I meant 1 each. 2 Firebrands/Scourges/Mirages against a team with none is still a lost game.
---
It's really up to player skill.
---
Thief is a really high skill ceiling class. They can't 1vX, and generally aren't even supposed to 1v1. That being said, when you up against a team with a good thief, you'll definitely see what makes them good. They will keep things decapped and +1 seemingly every fight. They will be everywhere at once, you won't be able to hit them, and they will just be the biggest pain in the ass you've ever seen.
---
The downside is, a bad thief is going to be worse than basically a bad anything else. They are easy to kill, most builds don't really have a random attack that can do a ton of damage, and aren't going to offer much to a team. They depend on a high mechanical knowledge of the class, their opponent, and the game in general. They aren't a great first class to learn PvP with.
---
On the plus side, sword/pistol is finally catching on. My personal favorite build for the past year. The downside is now it's probably going to get nerfed since people are using it, and that makes me sad.

Believe it or not, silk has actually been holding its relative value pretty well since the reintroduction of FotFW.  Since this last summer the sell price has been hovering pretty steady around 20-22c each.
---
Whew. It is sad that you are not happy about it. I pity for you :(
---
Simple, add craftable ascended/legendary capes and you can make them the silk sink we are looking for.\^\^
---
I agree, I think they are looking for stable income over big bursts. Plus with the new restructuring it will take time to make a new xpac.
---
"New design subreddit"? What's this?
---
That would require capes to be outside of gem store
---
Interesting, so maps are closing from too many banners. Basically if there's a map with a bug event you need for a collection or something, just spam banners to get an unbugged map.
---
Is there a way to just erase myself from the story?  I suffered through the B-team to get on the new map and got myself settled in to enjoy some proper horror vibes.  Turn a corner and Rytlock's whining to someone about how they don't take his tactics seriously.
---
I'm sick of it!   I want to adventure and have fun.  Not babysit these fictional adults who keep acting like children  I want out.  Is there a way to avoid the teenage drama without quitting the game?
---
Those statues depict Melandru, the Goddess of Nature, Earth, and Growth, and the tree motif is a reference to her scriptures describing her possibly creating the first [druids](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Druid_\(group\)) to act as stewards of nature. Interestingly the dervish's avatar form of Melandru is in fact depicted as a [sylvari-like creature](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Avatar_of_Melandru_concept_art.jpg) in concept art; we also see it during the fight against the dervish Warden Amala in her Melandru phase where she actually briefly turns into a sylvari although that may just be simple asset reuse unless there's some deeper lore connection to it somehow.
---
I always found it curious that the texts about the goddess describe her as follows:
---
&gt; Orrian history scrolls:  
---
&gt; Next came the goddess of nature. Wise Melandru, oldest of them all, made of Orr a green and flowering expanse. She urged peace with the races already present on this world, but her advice was not heeded.  
---
&gt; When she saw destruction, she brought creation. Where she saw anger, she grew love. With this, Melandru prepared for a future she knew would be troubled.  
---
&gt; Scriptures of Melandru:  
---
&gt; And it was that a tribe of godless humans wandered the land. Where camped did they lay waste, senselessly destroying everything nearby.  
---
&gt; And so the tribe set out to find another camp, when suddenly sprouted a wall of thorny branches, which blocked their exit.  
---
&gt; Then saith Ewan, leader of the tribe, "Know ye our ways. Whosoever does magic in this tribe shall be put to death."  
---
&gt; Yet none comes forward. Then, from the earth grows forth a large tree, and unfurling its branches, reveals the upper torso of a woman. Saith She, "I am Melandru, the Mother of earth and nature. Henceforth I bind ye to these lands. When they suffer, so shall ye suffer."  
---
&gt; And as She saith, so was it done. From their limbs sprouted branches, and the blood in their veins was the sap of trees. Then was Ewan and his tribe converted, and became they stewards of nature.  
---
&gt; Parable of Melandru:
---
&gt; One day, the goddess Melandru came upon a den of foxes, and she heard within the hungry cries of kits. She bent her ear to the ground and learned that the mother fox had been killed by a farmer.  
---
&gt; The cubs were doomed to starve to death, and thus was the way of nature. Melandru sought out the farmer, and asked him why he had killed the fox, thus condemning its kits to sure death.  
---
&gt; The farmer explained that the fox had killed one of his chickens, and therefore he had taken his vengeance upon the fox. "Thus," said Melandru, "is the way of nature."  
---
&gt; Later that year, the farmer prayed to her, calling her name in his darkest moment. In his presence, she saw that he was in mourning and asked what had happened.  
---
&gt; "Wolves," he said, "have taken my daughter. Can you not bring her back to me?"  
---
&gt; Melandru was not unkind as she said, "No. Thus is the way of nature."  
---
She is "wise Melandru, oldest of them all" whose parable is arguably the kindest depiction out of all the six gods in the [Siren's Landing parables](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Parables_of_the_Gods), yet she never became the leader of the Six Gods despite her seniority, caring nature for all creatures of the world, and pragmatism. There are some suggestions that Abaddon may have been the original leader of the Six until he was replaced by Dwayna; if so, I wonder why Dwayna was chosen as leader over Melandru as surely Melandru's wisdom and knowledge could've been a guiding light for the rest of the gods following Abaddon's imprisonment. Was Melandru simply content with being a kind of wise old vizier to guide the younger Dwayna, or was Dwayna more assertive as a leader that Melandru ultimately approved of for "a future she knew would be troubled"?
---
It would be fun if the story ever explored these topics about the gods' early years (as we have already been told about Grenth's predecessor Dhuum, Abaddon's unnamed predecessor who some speculate might have been Arachnia, Balthazar's unnamed father who might have also sired Balthy's half-brother Menzies, and devs mentioning how the cancelled GW1 Utopia expansion might have explored other so far non-canonical gods like Dwayna's unnamed father) and if we learned more about their respective histories to lift the veil of mystery surrounding these great divine figures just a little bit to satisfy our thirst for knowledge. :)
---
If you unlock the pattern it’s really easy.i try to do map comps for keys nowadays
---
Learning some of the secret tunnels and shortcuts are game changers.  That and Griffon, of course.
---
While OCEAN is superior, there is still a lot of usefulness to MBTI and 16personalities in particular has some nice parenting articles tailored to the personalities.
---
Anyway, INTJ and Necro.

Put some music on, find some guildies (/r/guildrecruitment) and just talk through the whole thing. Your character is the commander whatever you do.
---
What should I be doing with my excess hatched green chilis?  I don't want anything the vendor sells, and can't seem to salvage or merch them.  Any suggestions?
---
New reddit is bad and I personally applaud this sub for not supporting it.
---
True omg
---
There has always been and still is ^^
---
Griffon made me hate TD even more. There are countless invisible walls all over it.
---
It's a combination of tradition, greed, stubbornness and pride. 
---
As long as there's tourists that keep going to see it and the checks keep rolling, the other excuses will be enough to allow the government to keep it going.  
---
One doesn't have to be a separatist to have a harmful nationalist thinking. That's why the conflict in Catalonia isn't one between 'separatists' and 'constituionalists', but "whole Spain nationalists" and "regional nationalists".  
---
Instead sitting to talk and changing the constitution to make it work better for everyone, they instead lock horns to see who gets to impose their own nationalism on the rest.
---
INFP-T. Right now my three main classes are Elementalist, Thief, and Ranger.
---
Yeah. It doesn't seem like the elder dragons get to use new magics instantly. They have to spend some time to 'figure it out'. They may even be holding onto some magics they never bothered learning how to use because they never had the need to, and suddenly come up with a surprise or two.
---
It could have been that Jormag had the magics of the spirits all this time, but never bothered with using them.
---
ForFansByFans has some great HQ Merch. I gave my BF [a Taimi Mousepad](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/196359381304999936/563719359923486740/DSC_0693.jpg?width=377&amp;height=676) for christmas last year and the quality is amazing. I've got some other goods as well such as the plushies and they are pretty neat too.
---
I would also take a look on Tumblr, there are a lot of artist there who are open to GW2 Commissions as well. I've commissioned a few and was very happy with the results.
---
Just type "ice golem" on Google images...
---
Yeah, too bad for the most people the new design is the default and mods didn't updated shit, so the new design doesn't even have a fucking proper sidebar with links to resources.
---
I prefer the acronym CANOE :)
---
Honestly,i would rather wait longer but get a match i can actually win. No one enjoys getting spawncamped due to matchmaking.
---
&gt; There's nothing like them in any game out there, sans a few single player platformers.
---
I'm curious, what platformers are you keeping in mind?
---
Hm, I see your point. Then how about we do a mystic forge event with shitty rewards that requires the playerbase to dump ungodly amounts of silk? D:
---
Edit: Came out saltier then intended, but well...
---
&gt; I really, really miss HoT times, good old metas, commanding to even get TD meta
---
On EU HoT metas are still being run every day (at least during peak time).
---
I feel this way more in PoF maps. I just want to look at the scenery without being eaten *for once*. What's the point of all the beautiful landscapes, if one has to just rush through them :/
---
It is not your GPU, I believe it is a combo of arch (AMD, Intel) + NVidia driver +  game client, it is happening to me now for a Ryzen 5 3600x + EVGA RTX 2060 SUPER
---
And I just finished playing RDR2 which ran at 100+ FPS and it was fine, this is a new PC built on November of 2019
---
Why applaud this? This is a user preference, by having one half not up to date, you are just altering the experience of your users. For the worst.
---
Official reddit application is also based on this design. And by sticking to legacy design, you are also limiting yourself when it comes to new features (event posts, scheduled posts...).
---
I still cannot navigate tangled depths. My brain doesn’t work that way. I’d get lost and starve or more likely get killed and eaten, or even more likely killed by being eaten, within 30 minutes were I there in body.
---
It's a shelf for drinks :-)
---
Might be a recent refugee from the official forums xD
---
&gt; online count still has a year old joke about Skritt Math.

[It doesn't.](https://imgur.com/a/2Hjxrcq)
---
Out of interest, what do people have against condi builds? I can see why someone might dislike a weapon, but liking a weapon only if it does a specific type of damage seems strange to me.
---
There is a better/accurate personality online test? Just curiosity
---
The last two Living World seasons have had something at the end where you need 250 (at least) of each map currency, so stuff them in your bank and hope it's something cool.
---
So everyone wants the same thing out of a MMO?  Hardly. Yet that’s what you are implying. I could not agree with you less. Some people play for immersiveness.  Some people play for fun random encounters with other players. I absolutely don’t care about loot rewards, and my game playing goals are as valid as anyone’s.
---
I enjoyed my first time with Hot as well. Although I do have to say Playing opening night of path of fire was some of the most fun I had. No one knew the maps. My guild and I only had a vague way point of of where windswept haven was. Exploring as a 10 man raptor squad was hilarious.  Wish I had more time for gw2.
---
A strict profession cap has the downside of giving certain professions way longer wait times when that profession is very popular that season.
---
Now that we have the 'loadouts' to quickly switch builds, one possible way to avoid that problem and allow faster matchups would be letting players queue with multiple characters, up to 1 for each profession. 
---
It would also require locking characters so people can't switch at the start of a match, and keeping more strict separate ratings per profession.  
---
You'd go to a new tab in the PvP panel that can also be opened by talking with a certain NPC that introduces the feature and explains how to use it, then you'd see a list of all of your characters, and you'd be able to select up to 9 of them, 1 of each profession, to queue with them.
---
So if you queue with 1 profession, you'll only get into matches as that profession, but if you queue with all 9, you'll get into matches as any of them and can't switch once the teams are made, but your wait times would be way shorter as you'll get in first as soon as two teams are already full of popular professions. 
---
Going one step further, what people could queue as is not professions, but specific builds. You'd go to the queue settings tab in the PvP panel, set up to 9 charactes and up to 3 builds for each character (as long as the builds are not too similar, so there would have to be an algorythm to determine 'build similarity'), then once inside the match you would not be able to change profession or elite specialization, but you'd have a few points to 'pay' to make small changes to your build, like traits and skills, so there's still some room to adjust your build to the enemy at the start of the match, but at the same time, two players in the same team (or even the same match) can never have the exact same build.  
---
Kind of like how you can't have the same hero twice in either team in several hero-based games like mobas.
---
I run CCleaner at least 10 times per day. I also have removed personal user account Temp-folder completely (that one in %appdata%) after deleting personal user account environment variables, so all my temp files always go to Windows/Temp.
---
Once I accidentally ran CCleaner while GW2 was still running, trading post went crazy. Restarting fixed it.
---
I am in exactly the same position. I’m a professional with a busy life. I can’t play everyday and can only for an hour or two when I do. Is it frustrating sometimes? Yes. 
---
I don’t blame the game’s design for the limitations of my adult life.
---
The official answer devs gave for female sylvari having boobs is because the Pale Tree created sylvari as abract-ish versions of humans (due to being planted on the graves of Ronan's family) and made them look aesthetically pleasing to other races instead of making them look too alien, thus making female sylvari resemble women in as many ways as possible just like male sylvari resemble men (although if you look closely at the models, you can see these forms really are merely approximations given how the Pale Tree interpreted human anatomy).
---
Sylvari are known to have sex and have the "equipment" for it even though they can't get pregnant or impregnate anyone, so breasts likely also serve a purpose as sexual stimuli as they do with humans. :)
---
i thought a lot (sexually) about the one who made https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tangled_Depths . Oh the interesting ways of torture just for him/her and the one who approved the design. Map completion and achievments can change a man.
---
Damn man you have a heart of gold. I can’t deprive you of your book though
---
Why use percentiles when there are only 2 capes in the game? 100% of your comments that I replied in this thread should have 0% unneccessary percentiles
---
Like mounts, chairs, gliders or any new cosmetic feature they have added, the number of cape skins added to gem store will increase like mitosis with each patch while there will only be few new in-game skins added, if any.
---
Necro wurm summon is great for stationary bosses that fire projectiles. Very useful in the uncategorized fractal. Place it in the middle of the poison golem and on the asura at the end to save your friends a lot of damage.
---
Scourge F2 converts condis. On console stuff in fractals, using it on immobilize gives you resistance so you can easily activate all the consoles in say cliffside or aetherblade.
---
Blood necro is a thing. Got a group struggling to stay alive in fractals? Have a necro go 133 Blood and take the well heal skill. Best to use with condo scourge, but reaper works too. Now shroud skill 4 teles downs to you and heals, when you revive someone you drop a potent revive well, and you have another as your heal skill. Just carry carry carry necro friends :) (USE THIS IN UNDERWATER FRACTAL. Rezzing is scuffed underwater, so ya gotta cheat. Use blood)
---
Got a lot of boons to deal with? Of course condi scourge is great at it, but so is reaper. GS 4 pulses boon rip, axe 3 aoe rips 2 boons, focus 5 rips 3 or 4 boons. Need even more at all times? Corrupt Boon is a skill. It rips 3 boons and is an ammunition skill. Can also use spite 3. grandmaster so going into shroud converts boons.
---
Miss the good ol' days of epi, but now you play reaper? Well just use Spectral Grasp. Pulls 5 enemies to you for ez cleave and gives you a big ol' life force boost. Take it in place of your life force utility skill, like shade. Shade is not that good. Necro is broken because of it utility. Also a good CC choice. On the second boss in Observatory fractal, it is great for CCing 2-3 of the clones that spawn in the CC phase. Also great at pulling annoying mobs like in the bosses in Chaos that shoot CCs, and most anywhere epi was good.
---
Lastly, you fools who think condi scourge is dead in fractals are wrong. I can ez out dps most people I run with, right after reset or not. It has great utility and survivability and can carry with blood when needed. Most scourges I see are just bad, so learn how to play it proper!
---
&lt;3
---
If you like brawlers, play with the weapons they have, if you're gonna already be negative or dismiss things with a half hearted attempt then you're never gonna find anything you want.
---
Spellbreaker, Soulbeast, Scrapper, Holosmith they're all brawlers, but they use certain weapons you might not like but they're the weapons best suited for the playstyle (look at PvP builds).
---
If you care about what weapons they weild or look vs how they play then you're gonna find it impossible to play anything.
---
My suggestion, ignore the look of your character, if you really want to run around with a longbow then equip it, but it's not gonna be great on some classes. If you want to be competitive or relevant then spend time on class based on the class's mechanics.
---
Heart of Thorns was criticized too hard and too early. I hate that the criticism was listened to. My interest in gw2 would have lasted much longer if Path of Fire was more of what made the core of HoT while learning from its mistakes.
---
The worst part was that people spent so much time crying about how few maps were going to be in HoT. They ended up being so content dense and so much fun. That sense of adventure was something I haven't found in a game in a very long time.
---
 I'd tag some of the devs right now just to let them know my love of that content but I'm not sure who.
---
I loved Draconis Mons, and enjoyed going there daily to get the backpack.  I know it's not everyone's favorite chore, and I typically despise those kinds of things.  But that will always be one of my favorite LW time periods.
---
welp, you hate at least 1 thing in every build that you made. To me, it all looks balanced like everything should be. I don't see a problem here. 
---
The only option for you at this point is to try one of the other classes you mentioned like Mesmer, Rev, Necro, and Ele in succession and try to find the 2 things you like and the 1 thing you hate about each of them as well. Once you complete that you will have reached your ultimate destiny - the perfect balance as it will cover all the areas. 
---
I am partial to Guardian and Mesmer myself but I play mostly PVE with some PVP. If I was playing mostly PVP I would go with Thief, Mesmer, Ranger or Guardian in that order or Necro.
---
If you are partial to Ranger and like the GS go for that or also consider Gurdian DH, or  Necro.
---
I would like to add, you can cast meteor shower in Max range and then flash away further to saftey while channeling. This is super useful in wvw. 
---
Other long channel moves I like to combo with flash is earth 5 on dagger(this one can be hilarious in PvP/wvw) and staff air 3. Try to hit you Target with flash at the same time the animation ends since flash does additional 2-3k dmg
---
Depends. Did you play wvw before changes? Did you play pvp? Those have ascended gear walled off by some grinding, but if you like that, it should be the place to try. Otherwise, just craft your first set and purchase trinkets+back from LS maps.
---
I wish they made it so that the 24+ slot bags required a lot of them
---
watching this video kinda gave me the feeling that we could be able to do a barrel roll with griffon
---
Get trinkets first. LS3 &amp; LS4 maps give stat-selectable trinkets that will give you a total of 5 infusion slots (10 if you've infused &amp; attuned your rings &amp; upgrade your backpiece)
---
slot +9 AR into each of the ascended pieces you have so you end up with 45AR before upgrading any of your items; 90AR if you max out your infusion slots on your rings &amp; backpack)
---
weapons also have 2 slots; so you +18 on those.
---
Fractal 75 requires 106AR
---
this gives you plenty of time to get the ascended gear either through crafting, loot or buying (WvW &amp; PvP give Grandmaster Mark Shards; 10 of which give 1 Mark)
---
Something for a Lion's Arch chiropractor to work on :)
---
OK mate you're starting to look a bit pathetic doing this now...
---
Actually you can at least 3 if you manage to unlock the last chest on the Byzantium progress.
---
But I dont know if you can get more from it even tho it being repetible.
---
Dude... If only gw2 could lol

Elementalist tips:
---
Use Fire Staff 4 and then precast Meteor Shower for long-distance Meteor Shower.
---
Lighting Flash doesn't interrupt spellcasting, e.g. you can begin casting Earth Dagger 5 and then teleport next to someone right before the casting ends.
---
Switching elements also doesn't interrupt spellcasting, e.g. you can begin casting Meteor Shower and switch to other element immediately.
---
Mist Form doesn't interrupt reviving and finishing foes, i.e. begin reviving someone and go into Mist Form for invulnerable reviving.
---

---
may be this is the reason?
---
Half the playerbase plays Necromancers cause they have crazy base health, crazy healing on most specs and crazy damage. That's just common sense. In a real mmorpg like WoW, classes (specs) are properly balanced within their role.
---
What is a bloodstone dust eater used for? And whats bloodstone dust used for?
---
You mean two tokens and a blue?
---
The only problem with HoT I think is that, ironically, the heavy emphasis on meta events did not fit extremely complex map design.   HoT is structured so you want people to explore, but all too often they get pulled away from them just to gather at one point for a meta.
---
In the case of Verdant Brink, it works because the maps really do get harder at night, and the bases are spread out everywhere.
---
But in TD and AB, the metas are isolated to a single area of the map. I feel like it somewhat contradicts the goal of HoT maps on exploration.
---
I feel like the meta events should've been part of PoF with its simpler to navigate terrain, while the exploration focus should've been part of HoT with its more complex map design.  Instead, GW2 has it the other way around. Why?
---
Going into Druid CA mode,  Firebrand tomes, Elementalist attunements, and Engie kits all count as weapon swaps as well, for proccing on-swap sigils.
---
LOL, sorry I trigger you with % usage.  
---
Historically, back pieces have been items that can be acquired for map tokens.  Hopefully this trend will continue and we can get one with the next map's tokens.
---
Wtf? Idiots, idiots everywhere!
---
DEEEEEEEAAAAATH!!!!
---
I am not really holding my breath, they will most likely milk the fuck out of the capes

Well he needs that extra space for his pampers, obviously. Adventurer's life is very busy. Nature can call at the worst of times sometime, like when you're fighting a boss like the Shatterer. Which works two ways, coincidentally, cause you'll be shitting your pants when facing the Shatterer. That's why they call him the Shatterer, cause everyone will have shat their pants when facing him. So yes, armor practicality checks out.
---
Not so much here :(

And necro shroud. It's handy when paired with a sigil of Hydronancy for keeping up chill.

Mesmer should get rifle for Rip Van Wincle esque elite spec.

* Elementalist: Greatsword, but 1200 range spells like mesmer
---
* Engineer: Staff. Caster staff
---
* Mesmer: Hammer, duh
---
* Necromancer: Also hammer, fuck shield
---
* Ranger: Hammer
---
* Thief: Greatsword
---
* Warrior: Scepter. Caster, not clubbing things with it.
---
**ENFP-T**  
---
Mesmer (formerly boon Chrono) and Ele (Tempest Healer), sounds about right.
---
I kinda want a bow for necro, is that weird?
---
I have a similar set up and can get 30-40 fps in WvW, which is very playable. Turn off player's names, set character limit to very low, and put shadows to low or medium at best.
---
Yes, I played HoT then PoF in a row. Leaving so complex level design for the desert hurt me A LOT
---
The cons are trying to map 10 skills, movement, camera, jump, dodge, interact, special action key, mounts and the multitude of different panels in any sane way onto a controller.
---
What do they farm it for that's better than other fractals?
---
Thank you! I will definitely remember this :)
---
Thank you very much!! Xx
---
Thank you!!
---
Thank you xxxx
---
Bloodstone dust is a material for making ascended weapons! You'll be getting a LOT of it soon. Like, tons. They will flood and consume your bank :(
---
On the other hand, a 'bloodstone dust eater' aka mawdrey II acts as a trader in bloodstone dust for special loot bags, so basically it helps rid of extra bloodstone dust you don't want while giving you other stuff in return, mostly other crafting material. You can check out what it can give you [here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gift_from_Mawdrey_II).
---
just cuz you play with people that are so bad at the game they get outdpsed in fractals by one of the slowest ramp up condi builds doesn't really mean anything
---
similarly, necro isn't "broken" because it doesn't really have utility! the boonstrip is indeed nice but banish enchantment is a thing, the pull is fine but guard gs5 exists and so does fb tome pull etc.
---
you're really overhyping the worst pve class in the game and the first part of your comment about going blood reaper makes me think you probably do like t1 fractals or something
---
Yeah, a well balanced mmorpg, with new content you don't just finish in a day after waiting for 6 months and a player base bigger than the population of vatican city.
---
Ya hear that, boys? GW2 has less than 1k players, and any game with less than 1k players is an morpg and not an mmorpg. That and if you do more in the game besides play through the meta and story once, then youre playing the game wrong. Only losers collect achievements, legendaries, cosmetics, compete in speed runs and hard mode challenges, or sit around and socialize with other players. Thank you for enlightening me, kanami. For a moment there I was confused that there was more to an mmorpg besides the measure of time it takes to reach the end of the story in an offline rpg.
---
Unfortunately I can’t be facetious about your comment on balance because it’s too degenerate for me to even pretend there’s some logic to it.
---
Sounds like it's putting a version of your bin/bin64 folder in your temp folder? In my case it just has a folder with a few extension-less files in it and a folder with some files that seem to be related to the gemstore.
---
Maybe /u/drstephencw knows what's going on for you?
---
Gw2 has so many other problems and you focus on this?! Its fashion wars, put something else on!
---
BEST HOTFIX EVER!
---
how am i supposed to revive my friendly squadmembers in tarir now?!
---
hi, you reccomend to use volatile tools or volatile glyph?
---
I hope they tell us for how long so we can plan our involuntary time off.
---
Most rewarding public event
---
Can't they just make banners into buffs that get cooldown reset ooc?
---
because disabling banners everywhere is the best solution to this problem
---
..what?
---
There was a discord for 42 farm, not sure if it's still active, i still see 42 farm every now and then on LFG, though at least on NA usually takes a while to fill and it's not really that fast with pugs.
---
I've never left though
---
No the fix won't take them more time than 1 hour or so. But I guess they have implemented it on a branch with other content that isn't finished or shouldn't be released yet.
---
i too rolypoly
---
now you'll actually have to work for your AP &gt;_&lt; it makes for a weird shift in completionist behaviour. I've found myself doing a ton of content I had long since forgotten about just for AP now. pretty neat going back through the game this way.
---
You could have just said you don't like her videos because it's just her talking and no game play and left it at that. But instead you kept up with the very sexist comments. So yeah, people are going to call you out on that.
---
Oh boy the weeb eles and thieves would blow up
---
My eyes are just fine, thank you for worrying.
---
All I'm saying is that it's crazy to have a profession that has mostly easy to play specs and 20k health in the same game where you have a profession that has mostly hard to play specs and 10k health. They also have similar damage outputs in most situations. How is that balanced?
---
And the fact the game is almost certainly in maintenance mode is pretty obvious at this point. They clearly weren't working on a new expansion as of September, in fact I think Icebrood Saga was supposed to be a new expansion and they just scratched it a while back. And the quantity and quality of content they're releasing is crazy. Just think of what they released in the past year. A few short stories, a few masteries, a few achievements, a few mounts and a billion gem store items.
---
And don't get me wrong, I'm not a WoW player. If they release a good expansion, I'll play it, but the current one definitely isn't a good expansion.
---
There's no reason to be hateful or rude, I just stated my opinions. This thread is about profession distribution based on the player's personality traits. My main point was that the game doesn't have an even profession distribution because some professions are clearly easier to play than others. (which on a skill-level is fine, the base health portion of it, i don't agree with).
---
2 week content, that never returns.
---
yes it is. but its also very triggering when you wanna do hardcore stuff in this game and already have limited time.
---
the relevant dev post: https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/94146/temporarily-disabled-warrior-banner-skills
---
which tells us nothing beside confirming the fact they are disabled. some ETA would be nice considering how much use these abilities see.
---
&gt; We’ll re-enable them after the issue has been corrected.
---
here i thought they'd keep them disabled no matter what...
---
The game is badly optimized and there's not much you can do besides using the DX12 patch, overclocking the fuck out of your CPU, and running potato settings.
---
&gt; Yeah, fuck dynamic and novel player vs player content.
---
Gamplay loop: (I kill you. You kill me. Repeat for adrenaline.)
---
&gt; I’d prefer drip fed shallow pve instances and microtransations!
---
PvE doesnt have to be shallow quests and instances.
---
Both can be dynamic. Both can have microtransactions.
---
I don't wanna be that guy, but how have you not known this? How long have you been playing?
---
With that much AP, it's pretty surprising you haven't thought of checking the wiki or your gw2efficiency account (assuming you have one).

Sure buddy, though you may be right with it being implemented later
---
Oh look, it's Addec, shitting on GW2 again.
---
Well i mean you can not only pull it between two game who both have used something that go way back even beyond Everquest. It makes no sense. But if it was meant as a joke i just leave it at that then :)
---
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. When the community decides to encourage stupid spamming behavior to abuse a bug, they can't be surprised when ANet takes action to ensure the bug doesn't disrupt the game.
---
This is the right move - disable the problem until it can be fixed.
---
With Banners disabled, could we possibly use Revs as an alternative? AP
---
thief pretty much always had a place in pvp..maybe not always the best but until recently s/d condi was an oppressive abomination that thankfully got nerfed! it's still playable and pretty good though
---
wvw roaming you already know it works fine and for zerging there is a staff daredevil version that can provide quite some value, despite not being that great
---
in raids you can play it at all power bosses and it's meta for quite a few of them..it suffers in the condi department, especially after pvp-oriented nerfs harmed it in pve too
---
for fractals there is indeed a stigma against thieves because they're viewed as squishy and lacking burst! the burst part is true but you can still hold your own and the squishy part comes from bad players that dunno how to actually dodge
---
another great thing is that it has tons of personal utility! between blinds, blinks, dodges and stealth there is so much you can do and be very self-sufficient
---
**tl;dr** thief is fine, it's no guardian for sure but good enough
---
r/guildrecruitment
---
Of course it doesn’t, but we’re also on the gw2 sub.
---
Also, if pvp is a loop, story driven pve content is a straight line.
---
That's ... [Logician](https://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality)? I generally wind up as the [Advocate](https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality), myself. INFJ.
---
I like playing a ranger type because it means I get to have a buddy with me.
---
Judging from comments, disabling banners made raids too hard. Ty anet for finally making some hard content.
---
I've heard it before, too, in Psychology class. We took the test anyway, just because it's fun to see our results and compare.
---
Which might work in NA were there are many times zones whilst in EU it is night or day and servers Like BB and a few others simply play during night and ppt doors day in and day out and abuse the fact that most EU players sleep during this time except the few who play from other countries with a time zone or work odd hours and so on. 
---
This can never be fixed in EU, and why nothing will change with alliances for us. 
---
So instead of picking their most active WvW region apart with the alliances they could just remove the links and give us torunaments and let us try and solve the issue our self as was done in the past henese the burn out because people did stay up all night because it was a shorter period and why they needed a longer time to recover after that. But hey i guess we gonna wait and see, and then when we all realise alliances change nothing we will be even fewer players in WvW, well unless NA have not already died by then.
---
I swear, ANet couldn't spell 'QA' if you spotted them two letters.
---
W-Why are you replying to my comment? :O
---
I want a hammer for Ele, but i guess they will be boring and make a torch which is probably more relevant.
---
  - Revenant channeling Menzies with Greatsword and utilizing Cantrips that play mindgames with enemies and inflict cascading status conditions (x leads to y leads to z)
---
 - Thief with Greatsword and Mantras, a parrying defender class that reduces damage for allies and counterattacks enemies
---
 - Ranger with Hammer and Physical skills, a "play dead" Elite that lets the Ranger take direct control of their current pet for a time, buffing all that pet's stats and gaining access to a full, pet-specific set of skills. Shouts and Physical utilities could still be used by pets, other utility types (spirits, traps, etc) could not.
---
 - Mesmer with Short bow and Shouts, singing discordant melodies that beguile and harm their foes while soothing melodies inspire and comfort allies.
---
you can go to the lone person and gank it 2v1 then snowball from there but this all depends on the enemy rotations..which is why "cold" advice for it is pretty silly to give! just pick engagements you can win
---
firebrands give a lot of value but most of it is in tomes, if you force their f3 or renew focus early with say a rev going ham on them they will die! if you casually poke the scourge while fb casually heals it then it's a player mistake not a testament to the greatness of the combo..i bet you guys even let them get signet rez off
---
the fact that you say "whathever the hell scourges do" makes me think you don't actually know their abilities..i mean if you stand still and facetank all shade skills then yea scourge stronk! 
---
they only have 2 fear sources besides corrupting stability, hardly "spam"
---
scourge didn't get nerfed a bunch, it got freaking deleted! the moment they place a shade they gotta stand inside it or can't self-peel and are just punching bags..being confined to a 180 radius area is a death sentence in pvp, even if you can create 3 of those areas
---
i actually played very few games lately(since pvp is so trash now lol) but they were within gold 3-plat 2 and i saw like 1 scourge maybe? it's pretty much core for condi and reaper for roleplayers..maybe it's an NA thing or whatever?
---
all in all, objectively speaking, scourge is literally the worst pvp spec right now by far and it should not pose a problem, even with 2 firebrand babysitters glued to it
---
edit: wanna know how bad scourge is? metabattle, the place that lists even the memest of meme builds doesn't have one for scourge and they have pistol condi deadeye listed
---
Too much to drink last night.
---
You can see the daily cap by hovering the mouse over your AP in the achievements panel. You will see permanent, daily and monthly AP if you have them.
---
I like how they picked the day before raid reset to do it. It is right, but also at the same time it is incredibly stupid and just creating a handicap for next week.
---
I don't think a better cpu will help you much, they easiest thing to do is to set the settings of your secondary accounts to the lowest. It is only for farming to looks should not matter that much.
---
And that's why it took.. how long since PoF release? to notice and popularize this interaction. Because 5 minutes on test servers (where 99.99% players don't even test the mechanics and just fuck around) would made every single bug in the game fixed.
---
Changing between them whenever I get bored
---
Sure you can clear, but Op is talking about hardcore guilds. You can not set a record without banners (with a few exceptions).
---
You should probably look at their tag. By "Hardcore" they're probably going for kill records, not just kills.
---
Paralyzing? More like giving everyone a few days to realize warriors can be great pure DPS too.
---
You can't do "hardcore" stuff without BS in current balance state though, except extreme lowmanning (ike 2-manning strikes). You can't speedrun, you can't speedclear in lowman scenario. You can casually clear the raid or w/e you were thinking about, but hardcore, the actual hitting the top and testing the limits is not possible.
---
It's not about getting the kill when you do hardcore stuff.
---
You want to squeeze as much out of your comp as possible, and with Banners being disabled the overall Group DPS takes a massive hit.
---
Also, why take a warrior in the first place if the only reason for bringing one is gone?
---
L M A O
---
Okay, so, let's see here.  The options are all defaulted to the current game default and with no information on these controls, people are free to send mail and invite to party as they wish.  No problem, right?  But that completely defeats the purpose of these options when people come to reddit/forums/support asking for such things that already exist especially if they're tucked away.  This bloats support and the forums with useless threads because people can't google things.  Just reddit had people asking what these capes are and complaining about no free capes earned ingame when the guild cape was released along side the emblazoned cape.
---
These options you've laid out seem needlessly complicated to myself.
---
&gt; Allow whispers from them.
---
Just go invis if you don't want whispers from someone.  Alternatively, if they're harassing you, block, report, and don't look back.  If ANet just changed it so it was "Allow whispers from (Contacts only, Guild &amp; Contacts; Contacts, Guild &amp; Followers; and lastly anyone) sure.  Anything deeper than that is asking for far too much.
---
&gt; Allow mails from them.
---
&amp;
---
&gt; Allow mail attachments from them.
---
Just blocking mail from people who you're not mutual contacts with or share a guild with seems to be enough.  Having these two be separate options seems needlessly over-engineered.
---
&gt; Show them your location.
---
&gt; Show their location market m in your world map.
---
You can already do this by not representing a guild.  Boom, your yellow dot isn't on the map anymore.  If this is about adding this feature to extend to mutual contacts, then this makes sense.  Now about mutual contacts being able to see your location even when invisible, that's only a problem when you're marked as invisible (and that should be fixed, honestly).  You took the conscious effort to add the person to your contacts from your follower's list.  If you don't want them to see your location and, conversely, don't want to see their location, remove them from your list.
---
&gt; Accept party invitation from them.
---
Party invites are already on an accept/decline basis, and blocking someone stops specifically them from inviting you to party.  What's this option even going to do other than make it convoluted to invite some people to party when asking about forming a group in mapchat?
---
&gt; Let them inspect your build.
---
Why's it matter who sees what build someone runs?  If it's about someone being toxic because one trait is taken over another, they'd be an asshole about not being able to see the build to begin with. 
---
In short, I believe you can condense all of your options into the following:
---
**Allow mails from:** [Mutual Contacts only, Guild &amp; Contacts; Guild, Contacts, &amp; Followers; Anyone, no one]
---
**Allow whispers from:** [Mutual Contacts only, Guild &amp; Contacts; Guild, Contacts, &amp; Followers; Anyone, no one]
---
**Show location to:** [Mutual Contacts only, Guild &amp; Contacts; Guild, Contacts, &amp; Followers; Anyone, no one]
---
**Share Builds with:** [Mutual Contacts only, Guild &amp; Contacts; Guild, Contacts, &amp; Followers; Anyone, no one]
---
Thanks guys! Hope it's fixed soon! You're doing great!!!! I love your game!
---
If dungeons weren't abandoned content, people would know this from Cadeceus' Manor
---
yea fb itself is extremely strong, just wanted to point out it's not impossible to deal with
---
but a similar argument could be made about thief really..back in the day it was mandatory because if only one team had thief it was autowin for them due to decap and +1 potential
---
even release scourge(op af) had the trademark necro weakness of succombing to pressure! 
---
having a fb of your own can negate a lot of their pressure..but you simply have to adapt and change stuff
---
i heard scrapper is making a comeback, pre-nerfs it was quite strong and shutting scourge pressure down..not autowin but eh
---
My assumption is the bug has existed since the hotfix that fixed banners disappearing and going on full cooldown if they were interrupted or a skill was queued after. Maybe the mount interaction came from the latest change to banners, but the /gg interaction was definitely much older.
---
Great work, keep it up!
---
Agreed, and I would add Bloodstone Fen and draconis mons into the list too since they have such similar design.
---
Wouldn't that just be a rebunking? Or a bunking?
---
If you're still enjoying the game but not getting any toons to 80 I don't see a problem. Play the game the way you want to play it my dude.
---
Release the quacken!
---
Scourge shades
---
Cool man, I can't wait to play this video game that you've coded 100% bug free. Sounds amazing! What's it called??
---
Until that happens, you have no business criticizing the hard-working people who bust their asses with deadlines to meet. Shit happens. If you're that salty about the game you should probably either go play something else or learn how to leave constructive feedback. :)
---
Signet of Humility turns Moa's into random variations/colors of Moa. Using it on underwater enemies turns them into Tuna.

Call to Anguish, Mallyx rev's aoe skill works similar to Into the Void of Mes focus 4 wherein it will pull enemies in a sphere radius with no need for line of sight. So you can pull enemies from higher ground or on the other side of walls.   
---
Fighting stealthed enemies in pvp/wvw:  
---
1. You know they're still around if you're still in comba
---
2. the Minimap will show you their last known location before disappearing. As long as they're in radius of your character (despite not being in your Line of sight) the minimap will update their location. If they go down, it will show in the minimap.  
---
3. Skills that channel track enemies even in stealth.
---
4. Players tend to forget this but just because an enemy stealths doesn't mean they're immune to damage. Keep attacking the general direction from where they disappeared from.
---
Almost...
---
the mesmer goose that plants the portal on the first chest is missing.
---
That was not the issue, banner buff was not staying on forever, but the banner object itself was staying, and if you have a lot of people "having fun" with this bug it can make some maps/clients lag very hard because of too many entities in it.
---
It's not mentioned in the game and very easily skipped single sentence on wiki (if you ever need to visit daily page).
---
Alliances: Soon^(Tm)
---
But they were so festive! :(
---
Okay I'll try to help you, verdant Brink is a heart of thorns map (the first Expansion) and heart of thorns introduced gliding and some other masteries. Many are used to help you navigate those maps. 
---
There is a difference between heart of thorns(hot), path of fire (POF, second expansion) core tyria (Vanilla) and now ice brood saga masteries. You have to be on an corresponding map to earn exp for the mastery. Many masteries get unlocked through advancing the story. Belove me you'll finde a place to spend those points.
---
For your questions regarding elite specs (berserker or spellbreaker for warrior) you also have to trait the elite spec in the third row of your build (check hero pannel)  to equip the new weapon and skills.
---
If you have any more questions feel free to ask
---
this is rev's time to shine for raids
---
You can't really close WvW maps unfortunately and I don't remember if they can deactivate a skill based on the game mode, so if they can't then that may be one of the reasons.
---
Lmfao.
---
First, VB in HoT is kinda hard to get around, and it'll be way crazier once you get past Auric Basin to Tangled Depths.
---
If you have the GREEN (not red) HoT mastery points, you can start training these masteries by leveling. You can spend these points once the leveling/mastery bar is maxed. Mastery points can be obtained by communing in the map or by achievements.
---
The elite specialization is a selectable trait in the build tab. You can select the elite spec trait in the 3rd slot/line. You need the Berserker elite to be able to equip torch. 
---
To confirm that you are a Berserker, not just a mere warrior, you will see the icon change in the hero panel, from a winged helmet icon (warrior) to a fiery sword (berserker). You can google the other 18 elite specs icon.
---
Banners are disabled due to a bug. Plenty of reddit posts just a couple of days ago. 
---
And yes, mastery experience is very slow. But don't worry too much about it, just have fun doing events, story, getting to know the map.
---
If you're having a hard time, join a HP train from the LFG. My recommendation: please do not try to solo one. It isn't as any easy as core tyria.
---
Can they be permanently disabled?
---
Please?
---
you are not answering any of my questions and tbh a 3 months break for any AAA MMO is pretty big, the genre revolves around continuous playing hence why you have **so many daily tasks**, lmao
---
And just like that, warriors were not brought to raids...until people figured out they bring top end DPS even while wasting 2 utility slots on banners.
---
With Launchbuddy you can launch the game with minimum settings on both accounts, then relaunch your main account with your regular settings when you're done
---
Edit: just checked - running two clients on a half each of a 1680x1050 screen with minimum ingame settings takes about 1.6 GB RAM each, with 15-20% of my Intel i5-2500 3.4GHz CPU.
---
nothing has really changed since your break
---
yeah that is what I do.
---
Main reason why I quit a year ago. The living world is the main content in the game so how is it that it's so bad. You have no idea when it's coming out and what's in it. Sure we know it's usually 3-4 months (it used to be 2-3 but whatever) but most of the time theres a delay. These patches do not have 3-4 months worth of content for being the main content. It's barely a week. The things that do take longer than a week are usually time gated and require you to do dynamic quests that you have to wait for it to spawn or a group to do it. 
---
Anet has nothing to show. Theres no obtainable mount skins in game, gear sets have to be purchased and are not unlimited and for what? Occasional mediocre content? I used to be a diehard fan for 3 years and now after playing other MMOs (like ff14) I can say gw2 is heavily flawed and it wont change because of these guys.
---
Was a pretty shit joke.
---
that would still be Bethesda. See Fallout76
---
lets hope its not gona be same as it was with chrono trait... till next balance patch XD
---
i play a revenant and test result showed iam infj-t
---
And even if they could get everything to fit on a controller, they'd still have to code it and create a UI for it. Given what I've heard about their UI coding, that would be a pain and require at least one person being pulled off another project.
