gw2efficiency can tell you whether it is more worth it to craft or buy
---

---
In general, crafting first gen legendaries might get you some other small gizmos of note, or some interesting lore points, and it might just be interesting to do the collection
---
But other than that, the second generation legendary weapons (HoT onward) require crafting, and cannot be purchased off the trading post
---
---
---
People do pay others to craft the final step (gift of battle, gift of exploration, other minor account bound parts) for usually 400-600g. For me personally I enjoy the collections so I want to craft and complete them (and sometimes get a minor savings doing so). If you're just trying to get it for as cheap as possible you can save a little by avoiding the TP on big ticket items or craft the precursor and pay someone to finish it.
---
Well I guess this is getting fixed now. GJ OP.
---
Largely, the benefits are:
---
* People may have the gifts readily on-hand, negating the extra time cost.
---
* Personal satisfaction of having done it yourself (your mileage may vary)
---
* Being able to work on it incrementally, especially for players with chronic spending problems who might otherwise spend the gold before they save enough to buy a whole Legendary
---
* Because you want a second Gen skin that isn't tradeable
---
Sounds like you're looking for WoW. It's over there ---&gt;

Crafting a profitable recipe that was implemented and left in the game
---
ive tried other races but asura personal story and going with the durmand priory has been the most interesting story ive read on a mmo
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
i dont know about hot or pof tho, dont have the money to buy them.
---
Damn, I always spent my badges so I didn't have that issue :D.
---
Well I did sirens reef for the first time today, and got nuked out of nowhere and instantly downed. Wondering wtf happened, I opened the combat log and saw a shark attack hit for more than all of my health. I read the description of this crazy skill, it claimed it split damage among nearby... I ran to allies the next attempt and survived.
---
It's still stupid, but I managed to find it at least.
---
Also you actually have to play the map to get the keys, not like all the other maps where yoiu just have to play 15 min for the meta.
---
We still didn't get any Skyscale skin, so... What is the complain about?
---
Away from the dragons for the next LS season.
---
Just trait for traps and take the trap heal.  Plenty of cleanse there with CA 2.
---
No the reason you haven't seen an update is because it's normal for support to take a couple days to even get to your ticket, and it was also the weekend
---
Under the bosses name it says she splits/shares damage or something along those lines. Once you see someone die or nearly die to the shark it makes sense to stack on top of that person.
---
Probably different people who implemented it?
---
Rip dailies and recs.
---
I really wanna see the Woodland Cascades or the unknown continent, Wetlands/Howling Peninsula. Honestly tho I think the Charr homelands would make the most sense rn, Bangar Ruinbringer could possibly renounce the charr/human treaty since the threat of dragons and the flame legion are gone. This would be the perfect time for a Charr civil war type story.
---
Yeah, my guild had a party up in the uninstanced version of this back when core guardian had tomes as elite skills and Oiche's conversation was a topic of much humor.
---
The Claw is also a legendary now, but idk if the legendary weapon is supposed to be a replica.
---
Got the same problem too
---
There is no Skyscale skin yet. Neither a singel skin nor in a pack. 
---
However, since there is everything in the store -&gt; single skins, packs *and* choosable skins from a pack, there is no reason to complain. 
---
Also the Rollerbeetle never was a part of *any* mount pack, so there is *really* no reason to be afraid that this could happen to the Skyscale.
---
It's not that it was censored. It got really negative feedback.
---
In my opinion, it'd be interesting to see the story continue in a few smaller stories for a little bit.  What I mean is if LwS5 spends 3 or 4 episodes doing individual short stories and then begins the next major arc with it's final 3 to 4 episodes-leading into a third expansion.
---
For example, LwS5 Ep1 could take us to that area east of Tangled Depths and south of Brisban to follow up on the Mallyk plot hole. We can finally get closure with it.
---
Then Ep2 could take us back to Rata Sum and hear what happened to Zojja, giving us a final departure from her character (maybe she succumbs to her injuries from HoT or she just retires).  We can also use that episode to focus more on the "dying Taimi" subplot where maybe Gorrik turns her into the next Blish.
---
Ep3 could allow us to see the Dominion of Winds and give us some Tengu lore to satisfy those who are obsessed with them.
---
Either we continue to do things like this, or we use the remaining episodes at this point to begin a new saga.  The datamined map shows a lot of space in the east that we can't see in game. Perhaps we go there to deal with some bad guy, or we do a charr homelands saga.
---
Personally, I'd love to go back and see the rest of Elona that we didn't get to see, but everyone else always complains about desert maps and sand so I don't think it's likely.
---
It’s an API issue however these websites are overly dependent on API. They should manually save their builds so that these don’t keep happening
---
It's okay. Ask him to remove SA from Minecraft instead.
---
I'm just trying to pin a date on when this thing started so I can try to find it if this was ever brought up with shadow warrior around its release.
---
The Earth rotates around the sun
---
oh i agree, but we've seen anet "fix" things that were working as intended before
---
[deleted]
---
Kinda seems like Aurene is the new god.
---
They have two booths in the concourse but it could just be to showcase the game. It's not the same as a private meeting room like the last couple years.
---
I do, however, expect a season 5 teaser.
---
Technically we could go north to Cantha, it'd just take a while.
---
My whole idea was that you only get the increased reward if you do it in challenge mode (which would disallow you using portals, mounts, gadgets or other means that trivialize the JP). And challenge mode only being able to be toggled on at the entrance/beginning of the JP.
---
People would still be able to get portals from friendly mesmers or use port-to-friend (and/or now mounts and gliding), but they'd just get the current shitty rewards.
---
All the one time only that gives BL keys.  
---
Seasonal ones from festivals can be good money.  
---
I mostly run whatever I need for achieves (LW episodes ones or maguma/PoF ones)
---
Should have told him we are bonded for life
---
If you’re on Windows 10, this is no longer true. Borderless has zero FPS hit.
---
Believe what you want I guess I haven't played in months started back up after living story released. Talked up how well it was, did a few complained about people complaining about skyscale, bought some gems to support the devs. Played a few metals without saying anything. Made that typo, did a meta and was about to switch toons and got banned so believe what you want it happened that quick though.
---
There are real places with the same thing: Pennsylvania comes to mind... Penn being a person and sylvania refering to a wooded area.  Penn's Woods lol
---
Dragon Ball
---
with good dps,final boss last like 60 sec. like every boss in this game DPS&gt;MECHANICS. stop joining groups with 4 necros and you shoud be ok.
---
Don't worry, your precious skyscale will get its own unique 2k gem skin and plenty of milked to death reskins for slightly less. No need to whine about that one skin you cant get separately.
---
It took a bit when I had that happen,about 5 days iirc. My experience with support has overall been pretty solid.  My suspicion is it's taking so long because it timed out to hit a weekend, and you will hopefully hear by about Wednesday.
---
Try before you buy.  Talk in map chat and get to know people  then decide if you want to plunk money down (wait for a sale for the two xpacs).
---
My money is on Dragon Prance.
---
Make it yellow instead and it becomes Octodad
---

---
Reminds me of octodad
---
So since gen 2 legendaries are finished.. Will gen 3 be more pof specific? I don't believe they won't come out with more...
---
There's a version of this somewhere out there with an asura golem carrying the sign.  Unfortunately I've long since lost the post that had it on imgur :(
---
It could just slowly eat through stacks of stability the longer you "stay" in the field; every 1.5 seconds/ stack maybe?.  So it'd give value to skills that provide multiple stacks of stability like F3 (5) on Firebrand or Stand Your Ground.  I don't think anet would want us to be able to fully ignore a mechanic, but it having a certain level of counter-play would definitely be nice.
---
&gt; people would opt not to actually play the content in this video game
---
Not just this game, any video game. There is a reason why Cash Shops have become insane money makers. It gives players instant gratification that they need to enjoy a video game. Did you see how the community lost their mind when they couldn't get the Skyscale in one day? Yeah, this current generation of gamers are pretty cancerous.
---
Looks like French is their first language. Not english. You often end up with strange wordings when using a language you're not fluent in.
---
My beef with Siren is that the efforts are not justified by rewards. It's long, the ghosts don't drop loot and I hate the pointless maze.  Even better if I get a pug that triggers the spawning of mobs in the maze. 
---
And I'm saying as someone that has beaten the fractal during the horror days of pre-nerf We Bleed Fire + Birds + whatever damage multiplier instability (NPNG, AR, Outflanked, Afflicted etc), which makes the current iteration of Siren incredibly easy in comparison.
---
I do think Sirens Reef as a whole could use a balance patch but I see SA as a good mistlock. It punishes you for mindlessly moving around(which all of you do, don't deny it). Rather than trying to use strategy and planning you would rather it removed. All I will say is git gud. The fractal isn't hard if you bring a healer.
---
DLGamer's prices are usually among the best you'll get outside of a sale. Otherwise, I know the expansions will both go on sale again during the Anniversary.
---
Nuuvem (official Brazilian retailer) should have a 40% sale starting tomorrow from what I saw on their page earlier today.
---
It's actually shorter than "The Golden Child" in Tarir. It requires 100 spikes, but you can do more than 1 per run.
---
It can also be done even if the meta fails, as long as you can do one lane solo. 
---
Still it'd be more fun if the meta attracted more regular players.
---
Imagine playing a game because it's fun
---
um, holiday weekend in the us.  wait
---
But hey, getting there is now easier with the skyscale.
---
I personally find it fun. It is the only one of the few fractals which was able to wipe my party on first attempt.
---
Here's the base rule : anything can work in open world.
---
Anything works decently. 
---
Trying to get the most out of it is another question, but I guess yur not looking for that.
---
Just go ahead and run Full Zerker and camp GS if yu like it, swap a few pieces with Soldiers if yu find it too squishy.
---
Traits would be most likely Strength Discipline, even if yur not weapon swapping.

I logged onto gw2 today after a 3 year hiatus.  I was on maguuma server but now it seems im on a diff server? did maguuma have a merge or something?  When I click wvw I dont see maguuma and only see crystal desert and some others.  How do i even check what serer iam on?

this is why i said "but ok"

---
WvW now links smaller servers with bigger servers and this changes every 2 months. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/World#Currently_linked_worlds
---
Maguuma is currently linked with Crystal Desert, so as far as WvW is concerned, you're playing with CD until the end of June. You can still see your actual home server on the character select screen.
---
Where did you see this from?
---
Okay thanks :)
---
Okay thanks for the tip :) don't want my account getting banned haha
---
I want something simple. Something that’s not universe threatening. From the beginning we’ve been battling threats to the very existence of all life on Tyria. 
---
I also want something that isn’t firmly rooted in Guild Wars 1. Elona was nice and all but I’d much rather go somewhere that doesn’t have half the community thinking “why is the other half so damn awestruck?”
---
No more dragons. Not now. Something easy. Charr civil war. Humans we’ve never heard of (not Canthans), Norns we don’t know. Hell, I’d be keen just to go north of Divinity’s Reach and deal with new centaur. 
---
Don’t one of the Orders (Whispers I think) have a globe that indicates hotspots in the world? Pick one, and let’s go there. We know two bands of pirates with Airships. Let’s go.
---
Bruh have you seen power reaper benchmarks and the ease of the rotation it’s been weeks since anyone has beat my dps and most of the rotation is auto attacking
---
I love the hectic fun of it.

---
Eh, they dropped back to the level they were at when istan was the thing for months and months.
---
I think they're largely happy with this level, just wanted to push istan out of the prime slot so this map would get a fair chance at doing well.
---
I'm currently recording about 24gph consistently, which is slightly shy of riba and would possibly have still been overshadowed by istan if you could still farm it 24/7.
---
Is Oiche's name ever voice-acted in game?
---
Anet did a cool thing in giving a lot of the Sylvari Irish names, but they *really* butcher some of them when they get said aloud, so I'm just curious if we ever hear "Oiche" anywhere, I'd like to see what they came up with.
---
(The way they say "Niamh" makes me cringe, for example)
---
It's a continued wager. Has to pay off eventually, right?
---
Wish old LA was right there
---
If what you say about voice acting is true, then I'm glad I don't have to deal with that as a deaf person and just enjoy the aesthetics!
---
If out of the blue someone random sends you something valuable or gold and you werent expecting it, the safest thing to do is return to sender and then open a ticket to inform anet.
---
What I honestly have found with CS if you are honest, open, and understanding they will (as they can) move mountains to make things right. Most of my more serious issues got corrected well above beyond what I expected. If you lie, try to make up stuff, or just act like a general assbag, good luck.
---
In general, life terms apply here just like everywhere. If you are a pleasant human being and patient, good things will happen if you have issues.

---
well,normal meta pt,shoudnt have any issue. 4x necro is kinda last hope for plebs...,but with fb+rene or chrono and decent dps,you shoud kill boss without any issues,ppl just need to stop HUR DUR IM DOING MY ROTATION AND IM STANDING STILL (or IM RUNING IN CIRCLES LIKE MADMAN,which for some reason ppl still do) and focus on pushing mechanic,bcs thats basicly only thing which can kill you. ppl need to understand,that they can CHANGE utility or build to make final boss easier,ofc 99% ppl which failing dont do that and are used to be carried by perma quickness/ala+heals so they doesnt care,which is why there is still so many tears over siren and twilight oasis. ppl just need to learn mechanics and stop eating every shit enemy throws at them. in short GIT GUT.
---
Spellbreaker is nice but I feel like scrapper is more what you are after. I am not that familiar with them but some scrapper builda sacrifice some bunker for more damage and seriously hurt while keeping decent sustain
---
You mean *splat*
---
Confusion is good but I feel like torment is more painful because everyone is moving always (and if thet dont you can fear them to make them move) scourge necro excels at this in aoe fashion. I think revs are decent at condi torment builds too.
---
it's an inconvenience for later convenience type of grind.
---
I am now essentially using two mounts mostly now.  griffon and skyscale.
---
griffon for in light speed gliding and switch to skyscale for climbing challenges.
---
the beetle is reserved for flat land sprinting.
---
I pretty much dont use raptor or springer much now.
---
the dragon fall boss meta run you can pretty much get to the target faster than before, provided you are familiar with the boss location and terran.
---
Ooo I've heard this riddle before. The answer is nothing.
---
Dragonbatics
---
Oof doing story...
---
Also it doubles up as a big ass torch. So great for the pitch black pirate jp in LA.
---
Because you want it that way, here is where YOU are wrong.
---
&gt; I had to read it three times to get that it isn't new players that "aren't capable or willing" get into higher circles, but someone else is supposed to carry them there. Sorry what.
---
Group content isn't a one-way road. You need to have people wanting to do it on every applicable level, but you also need groups that offer places to those. It's not a matter of carrying, but when the only kinds of runs you see are 150 or 250 KP runs, and then a very rare group that doesn't care, everyone that is below 150 KP is stuck in the lower group. It is obvious that this leads to conflict in several different ways. What you need is people that would usually go for the high KP groups purposefully going with the lower level groups, so that lower level players have an opportunity so learn from higher level ones, to even out and raise the average skill level over time. This isn't some theory, this is literally how every other MMO with similar content handles it.
---
&gt; No and NO. There are things that experienced players would prefer to do and that statistically don't lead to faster clears and sometimes need to be retried. And NO, carrying a leech though the content isn't fun.
---
Ignoring the oddball tactics some people might try to spice something up, how are you going to measure skill then? If speed doesn't matter, why are people leaving groups because of wipes, when the only thing you lose is time? Why are people going for killproofs beyond excess and actual proof that you know content? Ah yes, because speed is literally the measuring stick in high end content.
---
And calling everyone worse than you a leech is just confirming my assumption that you are completely delusional and oblivious to what the average actually looks like.
---
&gt; No. Or next time we'll start balancing content around roundworms. Somewhere a line should be drawn. And as I've said, there are THREE more easier tiers of fractals. But somehow people don't like to see themselves unworthy for the highest one, with the best rewards. #raideasymode
---
Again, like it or not, T4 is content for the average player. That is literally Arenanet's stance, indicated by the introduction of challenge modes, and by tying "average player" rewards to T4 fractals. And when the bulk of the bell curve can't handle something that is meant for them, and you missed the opportunity to take the direction of pushing average players instead of helping them (like Arenanet did many years ago), you have to adjust the content. If you don't like that direction, play something like Final Fantasy 11 on japanese servers, then you have some resistance.
---
And of course you insult the idea of raid easy modes, even if the introduction of such a mode would literally take away nothing from those that clear normal modes fine. More signs of what I mentioned above.
---
&gt; Really? I've literally opened lfg right now and there is a 3/5 100 cm training run. Right now, :40 And also 99cm+t4 run that only requires a title (one kill). Sigh. And quite often there are some "any kp" runs. And you can put up your own lfg.
---
Of course your mileage may vary. There's a good chance that I'm just missing the runs I seek, but how big is the chance when I sometimes camp the LFG for hours every day. "Quite often" looks different.
---
And I have put up LFGs for the things I seek many times. I put up an LFG every single day for 100CM for my first kill and it took a year before I got a group together. I put up a group for Spirit Evader every day since the fractal launched and I haven't gotten a group at all so far. 
---
&gt; But right, it is elitist community that is incapable and unwilling to carry you. 
---
I never mentioned carrying anywhere. There is a difference between carrying and playing with those of lower levels, but you are appearantly too dense to understand that.
---
Thanks for the laugh. It would be the first thing I would think of I'm sure.
---
I've been saying in similar threads, the PR for this episode was atrocious, at best completely disingenuous.
---
The one thing I’ve noticed with this boss fight is that it punishes groups that have insufficient condition removal.  If you have the amount of condition removal that is required for this fight (which is very high) then it is easy. 
---
Generally when I encounter this boss, I have to respec to Druid in order to provide the group with the required amount of condition removal.  It’s gotten to the point where I literally have a “Captain Crowe build”.
---
i really don't like the new social awkwardness, i hate that other people are able to move you. i wouldn't mind it so much if it was just "you cannot cross the bubble around other players" but having other people move you into danger is just unbearably annoying. i wonder why they removed slippery slope but left this trashy instab in

Think of it like a Venn diagram, rather than as a set of individual events
---
Is Season 2 worth getting it for the rewards?
---
I heard the story isn't amazing, and is something you can just watch on youtube.
---
Yea it's shorter than tarir but the fact almost no one does the event and most people who are just rushing spikes... It doesn't scale well.
---
They should scale how long you can spike based on # of players.

Combination barber and sandwich shop is an untapped market. You could found it tomorrow and own the entire market share. There's no way you can lose.

Mess around with it and find something you enjoy. Half of the fun in this game is coming up with your own builds that work well together.
---
Delicious
---
Subway
---
Pick one
---
That also wasn't a change to traits. It is also not something you can easily stuff into every class.
---
Yeah, my complaint was mostly just referring to stomping around on post-250-year-time-skip GW1 Tyria locations. Story wasn't really a consideration in the gripes I have with the game or it's potential future direction.
---
Your bit on the state of Cantha illustrates my dissent with what I assume to be the popular opinion (LET'S GO TO CANTHA) pretty well. We could be written in that direction... and, whatever, I'll accept it - but as it stands there is absolutely nothing suggesting that it's likely. Quite the opposite even, from what you've stated.
---
&gt; Now we have the Tengu dominion, near the sea, there is certainly potential there for the water elder dragon along with a place that would both give cantha players some nostalgia and others who want breath of fresh air.
---
More Tengu! Sweet DSD package deal. I certainly like the sound of that.
---
The difference between the PvP Area and here is that the PvP area requires you to be top ranked in an AT or top ranked in an actual tournament to get into.  It's a prestige place.  This is a jumping puzzle that requires you wait 10 minutes to kill two easy mobs and go through a portal.
---
&gt;Additionally, we’re taking the opportunity to bring some Fractals of the Mists rewards into parity with the way we deliver raids rewards. Daily rewards obtained from fractals that provide a choice of ascended armor will now contain a choice of heavy, medium, or light attribute-selectable gear associated with their prefix (Assaulter’s, Defender’s, Healer’s, Malicious) instead of a long list of choices of gear limited to attributes available in the base game. This change will be retroactive and apply to any chests currently in player inventories.
---
It actually sounds like any chests you currently have will be changed.
---
In Teq's defense (or more specifically, in defense of the offense against Teq the offensive), we were shooting it in the face with a bunch of turrets (at least when people would actually be on them) as well as a megalaser.
---
That would make me want to die.
---
You could try the [-bmp argument](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Command_line_arguments#-bmp) which will give you lossless shots.  I'm not sure, but turning Render Sampling to supersample might help as well.
---
If it makes you feel better rare bags of gear give you unidentified rare gear, a box within a box how grand.
---
The 1660Ti had a better price/performance ratio.
---
It gives your current guild a random tactic or improvement [from it's list](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Improvement_and_Tactic_Pack). That item gets added to your guilds storage for them to use at claimed WvW structures. In WvW when you open the map and click on a structure (or talk with the quartermaster) you'll see the auto upgrades in the first tab and the tactics/improvements in the second tab. The guild that owns the structure picks what they want to use as their upgrades once they become available. I have my suggestions [listed here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Objective_Upgrades).

I hear BFA is lovely this time of year.

Really looking forward to Dragonfridge

Have you never ate at any other sandwich joint? Or even made your own? Both are always better and generally either around the same price if you are going out to eat or a lot cheaper if you are making your own. Regardless of which option you pick it will also be higher quality and not just turkey with a little bit of another meat mixed in.
---
Well GW2 not only don;t make any scratch to yours MMO itch, but make it even more annoying.  
---
It's most resident sleeper mmo in which I ever play. Exploring world around you and do random events is fun, until you realize that is most common way to lvling in this game. Yeah you can get exp from crafting and later on you unlock dungeons, but still mainly what you do is looking at screensavers, completing local events and similar stuff. 
---
Awful combat visuals not only in terms of special effects to attack, but also in terms of how combat work. Red tine line of circle without color filling is danger and don't stay in them. Green tine line of circle is a good place you can stay in it. Sound legit? No fucking way, simple example those two AOE type can overlap each other color, making some sort of blend between them. And this placed on dirt, grass whatever else. Ofc with more practice you can get to that. But still.
---
I can make tons of complains about this game. And all of them will make sense in some way or other. But I am still playing this game and enjoying it in some weird way. It's a good game to just chill after work or whatever else you doing. It give you feel of progress without any effort. And community kinda fine and fun. Story pretty fun and entire concept do whatever the hell you want and you still progress is good to relax. As everyone saying to just try it, since it only cost your time.
---
Bonus recommendation after completing tutorial go to the PVP lobby. Inside it your character is max level and you can try how class feels. Cause it can be annoying playing for day or two and then realise that class don't "click" for you.  
---
P.S I know that I am not target audience of this game, but who say that I can't have opinion about it)
---
You're Never Gonna Keep Dragon Down
---
The ones with bonus like unbound or volatile magic can be more useful, since you gain extra stuff every strike.. but yes you still need years of gathering for them to pay off
---
You misspelled Rata sum. It has a WP in the middle of the bank, TP and guild hall. Crafting stations are at 2 raptor leaps away all at the same distance from the center.

1. Leap to crafting station.

2. WP to TP

3. Repeat.

Aurene is a now a dragon like modremoth, zaihtan, kralkatorik, primourdus and jormag. She has the magic of Balthasar absorbed, but what is with kormir, lyssa, melandru, grenth and the others? The are gone.

In America, they are the lowest quality chain sub place you can go to. I could pay $7 and get 8 slices of meat on really cheap bread or I could pay about a dollar more and get an 8" sub from Penn Station and it would have about triple the meat and it is by far higher quality.
---
Its so sad because I feel like Ellen just won because she is human and most play human.

Reminder that we'd gotten an Abaddon raid/frac if Evon had won. They exposed some of the winning development ways while the vote was still going and Evon had so much more stuff that catered to the classic mobkilling dungeon oriented MMORPG player.

&gt; They make it somewhat difficult to access all the stations bank and tp in all non-lounge map to encourage you to buy a pass key.
---
Didn't have to go that far; making LA into Concrete Seaworld where all the buildings and the ground are the same freaking color did that for me. Now I go out of my way to avoid Lion's Arch.
---
Thank you!
---
Why not anger Bubbles so that Lion's Arch gets demolished again and build a new one that isn't dreadful?
---
Dragon tales dragon tales!
---
Rest assured, no matter what comes or where the story goes Asura will find a way to infect it. PoF managed to hold steady on the Balthazar story sans Asura (excl. Taimi) but as soon as the reigns were free, *bwoop*, Asura everywhere, including conveneient secret bases all throughout Elona.
---
So. You're saying you want to see this a thousand time... Just like Mordremoth cutscene ?
---
Remove social awkwardness so that people are unable to push you out of safety bubbles anywere, please*
---
Just give us the old one back :(
---
Why do people need a guide to complete a collection with hints and marked locations? Is it that hard?
---
Yeah that's how I felt as well.
---
The expansions were bare bones and didn't come with raids or fractals... either the expansion cost covers that or it doesn't and is terrible value.
---
Why not? The skin is unlocked. What's the harm in deleting it?
---
Hard to do when new content isn't included and the content that is no challenge even on joke builds with greens.
---
think of it as having "melee attack assist" forcibly turned on for other players then, you cannot enter their hitbox but if both of you are somehow teleported to the same spot then you can just walk out then. better this way?
---
*'gud' is not a git command. See 'git --help'*
---
If we are isolating each and every armor piece you have there then yes - the gloves are minimalist by themselves. You could even say the rest of your gear  is minimalist, when they are viewed individually.
---
However having armor pieces with 5 distinctively different sets is not minimalistic (hood, shoulders, gloves, boots vs the chest and leggings).
---
Imagine having two sets of minimalist pattern, they will no longer appear minimalistic if one is to be placed on top of the other. 
---
I will not comment on your actual look, as it is YOUR look - the most important factor here is how YOU feel about it.
---
How screwed am I if I start the Aurora collection? I'm making a star-y themed character and those planets effects would really suit him &gt;!plus having a legendary amulet is cool too!&lt;
---
&gt;i really don't like the new ~~social awkwardness~~  instabilities
---
Fixed that for you. Every single rework for them they did is terrible. How about actually designing good boss fights instead of random annoying stuff that comes and goes
---
I believe it's from the first Wintersday when the PvP wardrobe was still a thing
---
You can usually divide traits into
---
Power dmg increasing - like most spite traits, up, mid, mid for example, some in soul reaping also increase pwr dmg greatly like up, up, mid
---
Condi dmg - curses traitline
---
Egoistic support - like death magic, giving you more toughness but also a bit of dmg increase like the minion trait
---
Altruistic support - like blood magic
---
The elites are usually leaning towards power with reaper and condi with scourge, to scourge its amazing support
---
Now that you have the traits, you can start getting the right stats for your gear and experiment with runes and sigils :)
---
For Ash Legion!
---
I don’t see any tracks that give BL keys. Would you mind pointing them out??
---
One interpretation:
---
The story can enrich the world you're playing in, giving context to how and why things are the way they are now. It provides additional context to your gameplay to further increase the enjoyment.
---
If only that area didn't have what feels like all the players of a new map meta event cycle. Extreme loading time due to this. Also minor incovenience being that your orientation upon loading in is chosen at random. Mistlock Sanctuary is certainly great, but far from perfect.
---
I'm a simple friends, When I see a like I man

Oh, right, of course...

Very rarely and even more rarely for artistic changes. Those dragon designs are older than the game and made to be epic, that's the whole point of promotional art, they are not possible to do in-game and would be a very stupid move. Or do you really think they'd fit in a dragon as big as mountain range and as large as 3 GW2 maps? Who the fuck would animate that sort of thing and what monster of a PC would you need? Dragonfall is as close to that as your gonna get and it's literally a call-back to that specific concept. Or that original piece of Primordius where he was 5 times smaller than now?   
---
You'd be wise to disconnect promotional "concept" art and the game itself, art has the freedom to do whatever it wants, a game doesn't and shouldn't.
---
Getting two factor taken off of an account should require the most security checks and would likely take longer. If you have all your details, it shouldn't take much longer once you actually get ahead on the queue.
---
This seems like the only comment implying you understood the joke. I feel the rest of the thread is either not acknowledging it or just missing it :p
---
I mean, it's not a baseless statement, fractal CMs and raids have been getting less and less attention over the time. As someone who mainly raids and feels like anet really hit a sweet spot with some of the bosses they released, I want their team to keep releasing stuff, but with the layoffs and the amount of time the rest of the team is probably spending on continuing LW and adding new features for pve casual content, it's always a possibility.
---
I'd just like some transparency from anet, it feels like they know the invested players are doing raids and fractals, so they think admitting that their production is super slow now will make them go away, but that's already happening because we have no info about content releases besides the cookie cutter story. At this point I wonder if they put more thought into skyscale than w6-7 combined.
---
[removed]
---
I’m working on it right now, just finished the first collection. It isnt especially hard to complete!
---
The sentient seed to start the collection is just a bunch of scavenger hunts. Easy enough with a guide, a little bit of time and you’re done. The converters are hella nice too.
---
The biggest roadblock is probably the first collection for each map. This requires you to get achievement mastery of each map, meaning getting most of the achis for the map, including story ones. Then all the hearts and some specific killing ones that are trivial. Then, you have a few pieces of gear you need to purchase from the heart vendors. These total to about 950k karma, 100 jade crystals, and 200 oyster pearls. Then you got the big boi wayfarers henge achi. This is the time gated one from draconis mons. Do the hearts everyday, and buy the druid stone from each. This takes a week or somethin. Also you need to kill the meta bosses in draconis mons. The maps is dead, so you’ll have to solo or duo a lot of the pre events. You should lead these, you’ll get one boss per run usually. There are dulfy guides I think of every map mastery, so gl. Just get started on the stupid timegated hearts.
---
Meanwhile, you should already have built up 21 lumps of mithrillium because of the time gate with the druid stones. Craft the [ingot thingys](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Xunlai_Electrum_Ingot) and scavenger hunt with them. Then BOOM collection done.
---
Then all that’s left is crafting it. It’s the same crafting as a normal gen 1 legendary. Costs 1300g right now with no previous mats. Then BOOM legendary trinket and purpleness around you :D
---
Just remember this: have all the lw3 episodes, grind the druid stones in draconis mons, grind mithrillium ingots for the xunlai electrum one. The rest is just scavenging, achi grinding, leading a few events (one in lake doric on top of the draconis mons bosses) and crafting a leggie :D
---
Not a hard collection overall
---
Yeah ... if only we had thought to play from the beginning. Silly us.
---
We will go straight into to water and recreuit water elves and with them we are going to fight the mighty Bubbles of the watery domain. It is going to be epic!
---
I agree. This part is so easy it’s silly.
---
Just in case anyone tries this as of 5/28 it's still broken.
---
Normally you only talk about the body when the person/animal is dead, otherwise, you'd just say: "What Kralk looks like before the map resets". No matter I thought he'd die in this episode anyway.
---
It still doesn't work tho sadly, nothing happens when you get to the end of a rift
---
Is there something wrong with the metabattle site? Most of the images are not loading for me. It looks like this https://i.imgur.com/3X5fG0D.png
---
Under no circumstances is SA a good mistlock.  It is counter to the fundamentals of the combat system.  Being near your teammates is suppose to be a good thing.  No pain, no gain is a good instability.
---
Is that what we voted for way back then?
---
You can also get a cheap base version of PoF. Super duper editions come with extra stuff that's generally not worth it, they do not come with Living World passes. You can upgrade your account later if you end up wanting some collectable from a higher tier edition, so it's not an issue in any case. I'd skip them for now. During a sale you can get Path of Fire for 15€ and a bundle including Heart of Thorns for 25€ (50% off). 
---
Expansions continue the story in all new maps filled with all kinds of new stuff. HoT adds gliding and PoF adds mounts. Living World continues the story between core and each expansion. Season 2 is available with just core (F2P), season 3 requires HoT, and season 4 requires PoF. It's likely season 5 will also require PoF. Note that PoF does not require HoT (nor vice versa), both expansions work standalone.
---
Newest episode of Living World is always free, you just need to log in to unlock it. If you don't have PoF, you can still unlock the episodes, and they'll become playable once you purchase PoF. This is worth keeping an eye on, especially if you decide to start with HoT and go for PoF later. You can very realistically acquire past Living World episodes with gems you purchase with in-game gold, so expansions are the only thing you need to open your wallet for.
---
Thanks! That's what the original does to me
---
But meta builds are good here. If you run rene/hfb and 3 dps its easy. The only issue there is is that everyone has to do something... Which is supports doing everyday job and dps doing good dps instead of mediocre/bad/shit and playing attention to whole three mechanics, something proven to not be obvious for our regular pugs.
---
Honestly you could invent any old excuse to "re-experience" the Zhaitan fight, from a lore perspective.
---
Maybe a raid wing based around some sort of artifact that allows Glenna and the raid squad to view and experience battles from a time long passed.
---
Could be a cool excuse to fit other battles within lore into a raid.
---
Alright, ugh. I feel like I'm missing soo much important stuff
---
Did you boost? Thats a definite symptom of people who boost their first character.
---
Some people would love it ... and others would cry the story is locked behind raid content, as they did for first wings.
---
Thanks! 
---
Dunno what's "a while" but I loved PoF and the living world season 4. The latest map is beautiful.
---
That's shitty, damn
---
Yeah - I addressed that in my post.
---
I'm aware that putting a fight as significant as an elder dragon fight in a raid would piss off a lot of people, which is why I think they could get away with it for Zhaitan. His lore is all established, and doing a fight in a raid would add very little lore, and would almost solely be just the fight.
---
are you at least in exotic gear?
---
I boosted my first character then leveled my second one through the story. I just don't know how to get exotic or ascended gear.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character
---
Here's a great guide! Honestly, the cheapest way for you to get a mice full set of exotics is to get the temple gear for Karma, that's what i wore for a long time, and it'll have matching armor sigils.
---
I assume you boosted your character to level 80? I would recommend relevelling another class from the start to have a much better understanding on how combat and gear works in the game if that's the case. Also revenant may not be that newbie friendly of a class. I highly recommend trying out warrior, ranger or necromancer if u are new :)
---
Guilds are great! Social aspect of it, guild missions, guild hall decorations if u into that. Highly recommend you find one that has peak online time that meets your play schedule :)
---
I'm not sure they would accept that so easily. "But it's just a model, we could call it #RandomMinion1234 !". Yeaah ... with Zhaitan skin, flavor and design. So still story.
---
That’s so true. I love the original, but your version nails the spirit of the song and adds another interesting layer to it 🤘🏼
---
They're the Jungle Rank tracks that give a finisher at the end. Might have to rank up to get it since the first track requires Rabbit. There's 9 in total and they require the previous track's completion and a high enough rank.
---
Indeed. Each explorable dungeon gives you 75% of your current XP bar. I leveled a few toons using this method and a few good friends. Pop a booster on top and you can get a whole level in a few minutes. Mind to add that ANet stated that their ideology for time invested for a level using open world stuff is around 2 hours. Which means this method might be 6-7 times faster.
---
Did you make this all? Where you made it in? ableton, fl studio?
---
Ah shit, here we go again.
---
You can also pick up exotic gear with karma from the vendors at the temples in Orr (Straits of Devastation, Malchor's Leap, and Cursed Shore zones). Each temple has a different type.
---
The stat selections are fairly limited but they do have Berserker (Power, Precision, Ferocity) and Rabid (Condition Damage, Precision, Toughness) which are both useful. Could also pick up Soldier gear (Power, Toughness, Vitality) which will make you hit like a wet noodle but if you are indeed bad at the game the survivability might help you out.
---
It's a great way to kit yourself out if you don't have much in the way of gold or crafting materials. Just be aware that the vendors only show up if the pact is in control of the temple in question.
---
I want Selbbub to melt the canthan crystal sea so we can go there
---
That's factually wrong.   
---
If we had gearcheck tools in-game you'd see that most of you warriors or soulbeasts don't run a mix of assassin and berserker, which is a combination someone sat down and calculated was the best, they might not even run full berserker. It's not the issue of meta/non-meta or good bad. Your idea that there should be tactics that are good for everyone is not feasible, you cannot connect top 1% and dogshit players who aa on condi gs mirage in shaman armor without some scripts that would scale boss' damage and health on the fly according to gear of the party. What is more, even if such technology was time and effort efficient, you wouldn't have much use in this game because we have a huge focus on rotations. If you don't know your rotation and a boss you're a dead weaver.  
---
I wholeheartedly second Ivris, not all content is for everyone. If you can't manage something, either learn how to or skip it. Or find another game, I've heard those mobile titles play themselves, you don't need much skill, only a meta credit card :3
---
Back in Time. No further explanations. Just a complete reverse.
---
You'll probably want to get power based armour and weapons as a rev, condi requires more investment so I'd recommand: [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Devona%27s\_armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Devona%27s_armor) 
---
look for the above armour on the TP, don't buy the generic berserker set as that will cost you alot more (about 5x-7x more)
---
then get yourself 2x berserker swords and either a berserker staff or berserker hammer (staff has better CC, hammer would give you a ranged option), you can even grab both if you want to be able to choose as you need.
---
for your build, use something like this: [https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Revenant\_-\_Power\_Sword](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Revenant_-_Power_Sword)
---
Thank you soo much!
---
But then you can use the upward momentum from springer's jump to get wherever you want to -- they'd have to have some sort of special "no mount" debuff that specifically allows raptor and beetle, but not the others.
---
no problem, hope you enjoy playing and with abit of learning I dont doubt that you can solo all of the story on a revenant without a problem, I've done it and I'm not that great of a player lol
---
I think this is a consequence of their model of condensing living world episodes to one new map: the new events in central tyria need a place to happen
---
Lake Doric was a great repurposing of a map that was presumably scrapped before release. With the Asura you might be able to conjure up a "ruins of rata sum" map. But the rest is going to be difficult
---
Rubble LA was my LA, you never forget your first. I miss western ward and fort marriner.
---
With an 8700k and a 1080ti, its just player density in the direct vicinity that dictates loading time. Empty areas load within 5 seconds.
---
I'll have to dig out one of the old two week passes and try that out for a change, thanks for the tip.
---
make it a mini raid, like the snowman dungeon. him dying like this without any fight is just stupid af.
---
Probably because a company is going to pay more for better voice actors in the target language and feed the financial table scraps to the others.
---
&gt;Could maybe be plausible lore wise (I think) as we don't actually see him die, just disappear after beaming him.
---
And his magic gets spread out and absorbed by other Dragons, which is a very conclusive evidence that he is in fact gone.
---
Still cant believe they translated the "Rock Star" title to "Meister der Steine".
---
the comment I was replying to was not talking specifically about this item.
---
As an aside, not sure anyone has mentioned that yet, but the game is pretty stingy with trinkets, which consist of 6 pieces of gear and give quite a lot of stats. So when gearing, make sure to fill out those slots too. And if you go for full damage gear, you'll still have to learn how to quickly blow up enemies and dodge their most powerful attacks, so it'll still take some learning even if you gear up.
---
I saw that you are playing revenant. Try out [this](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vlAQJApnn3geNSuQvJRboHlsP0kS4I6SJ4EtrkFUlh9onqKNgCSwO91rH-jBiAABA8AAiRPwTK/S4EA8g5PY2fYWlgBp+DA-e) build if you can. It shouldn't cost you too much gold and you should be able to solo most content in the game with it. It will cost roughly 15 gold to get with the armor costing about 2 gold to get all 6 pieces with runes costing about 50 silver to replace them and the trinkets and weapons costing about 2 gold apiece. If you buy rare trinkets of the same stat, they will hold you off until you can upgrade them later.
---
This build is super easy because the damage is very simple to get down and you are insanely tanky with 1300 toughness and 26000 health, while still bringing good damage for clearing mobs.
---
With this build, just activate your facet of darkness and your facet of strength for permanent fury and 15ish stacks of might and use your elite skill and your facet of elements off cooldown for the consume's damage. Your main source of damage with be your mace 2  which creates a high damage fire field and your auto attacks. Use your other abilities to add more damage when needed but it can make your energy go a bit low as your upkeep is going to be +1.
---
You should have a "free" transfer with every expansion you bought.
---
Don't know if it works for changing region too.  
---
I'd open a ticket and mention the free transfer for having bought the expansions.
---
It does, but the consuming rate is 0,5s per stack
---
You say that those people are not capable of burning down the bosses.   
---
How many hours do you think they devoted to practicing their rotations and reading guides and stuff? Cuz I think their time spent preparing is in reverse proportion to the amount of issues they have in the fractal.
---
well,there are meta nazi which doing cms+t4 in 1 hour and there are ppl which are not able to burst ooze in taumanova. you must find middleground XD
---
Basically what I'm suggesting is that this fight with him always happened, but was just never shown. It wouldn't contradict any prior lore/story this way.
---
I too am a man of culture
---
Cant believe they still charge R45 for Joko...the bottom row is where its at for tea. Joko is just leaf dust.
---
I just hit lvl 80 and I feel so lost at the moment that I just walk around LA thinking about where to start.
---
So I'd like to ask for help with (playing warrior):
---
* Gearing: where do I start from when it comes to Ascended gear? Currently I'm wearing full exotic armor + weapons. Have ascended rings with +9 and + 10 agony resistance. Weaponsmithing is at 375, armorsmithing at 120-ish.
---
* Fractals: is there any way to get ascended gear from t1 fractals? what useful loot can you get in t1 fractals? Since I can't do t2 fractals due to agony limitations. How do I move onto higher fractals?
---
* Entering lvl 80 zones: this might sounds stupid to some of you, but I'm having real problems entering lvl 80 zones. Can't find gates, walking in circles and this is ruining exploration to me which was one of the best parts of this game so far. Is there some sort of map with gates visible?
---
* What else should I be doing now as lvl 80?
---
thanks in advance!
---
If you care about story, don’t skip season 2. It’s got one of the best twists in the game, and really sets you up for HoT. If you don’t want to spend the money, you can join a friend for them, but you’ll miss out on Central Tyria mastery points and achievement points.
---
THIS SO MUCH.
---
Would be a REALLY cool fight then. Just like how they made that REALLY cool fight against Lazarus. Personally one of my favorite moments in gw2 killing such a good character from gw1 in a hidden cave made his death that much better since he didnt deserve a better fight/death than that. Hope anet does more stuff like this were prominent and evil figures have the feeling of being all powerful but just dies after I spammed 1 ten times on him.
---
What is he going to do? 75% of this world is human women, which he will not harm.
---
Yeah I really want the transparency too.
---
All story content is designed to be solo able and also unfailable
---
Wow! That's strong quality tea!
---
People need to realise e3 isn't just for the customers that play games.
---
I don't have problems with the furry community, but it's indeed a minority group.
---
And probably too late in the night for me, thanks for the explanation.
---
Thanks!
---
U/thespiffingbrit 
---
How do you feel about your holy truth being a lich?
---
Well green and necromancy is weirdly connected in a lot of games, but this is something else… 
---
Also that Reaper E
---
Personally, I think that the fight against lazarus was the worst that happened in all GW2. Lazarus had a vast amount of lore behind him not only through season 3 but parts also in raids and, more importantly, through the history of guild wars all the way back to GW1.
---
Gathering the aspects together and then stabbing him with a weapon we just acquired by joining a human only group as, possibly non-human, was very weird and didn't do justice to the whole situation, the lore behind all of the parts and the characters.
---
I just had the exact same problem, I had to wait 10 days to have the authentification with my old telephone number suppressed. It happened to me at the time time as the War Eternal release so it was probably lost in the bug tickets, I hope it won't take that long for you!
---
Hmmmm, lekker teetjies!  
---
*Translation: Tea... goooood!*
---
Also, the skyscale makes idle sounds from time to time. You can hear where it comes from and how loud it is to get a good idea of where she is. Turn up that volume people.
---
In the lvl 10 Charr quests your first blood legion recruit yells out that she’s going to serve the flame legion a “steaming hot cup of death”.
---
Wonder if this is what she meant.
---
I would come back, get a character to level 80 and see how you feel after. The game is enormously improved with the two expansions. Not only the extra maps , but the elite specs , mounts and gliding and raids. I couldn't imagine it without them. As you already have the base game, may as well dip in and test the waters before you commit to the two exps.
---
yes
---
Ah yeah that's what I do. I use Jackal to travel through the wallows and the beetle through Nuhoch Lane to Ogre Lane.
---
Glad to hear we are of the same opinion. Now you can probably understand why I will say what I am about to say. There is 2 ways to go about making a good fight in gw2.
---
Making gw2 evil figures into a raid boss. This will give more depth into them and will give them a fight were you feel that they are strong and cant be taken on alone. Because lets be real our character in no way should be as strong as these figures who managed to absorb so much magic and ensalve this many people. That is the whole point of why we need the pact and companions to help fight them, because we arent strong enough alone. We NEED other people to help us, and a raid needs 9 other people to help YOU kill a raid boss. So imo putting a boss like lazarus in an instance content would be not only justifiable, but also good for the game. I can see the downside to this and I can understand people not liking it but I feel lazarus deserved better than he got.
---
Another way to go about it is simpler and better for the casual part of our community. I need to first say that I liked the fights against balthazar in PoF, and feel these are way more difficult than what we normally get. So my other option is to make the boss fights like balthazar fights were he is pretty strong and you feel it. He got some mechanics that feel like you need to dodge instead of face tanking everything since you will die.
---
So thats my opinion on it atleast I feel the evil figures dont get what they deserve and that makes killing them that more bitter since you knew the would have been better used in a raid or something. It would give them a satisfying ending too. Sauls arc imo ended on a good note and I am glad he was in a raid so I could experience it too
---
Ps. Would like to clarify I was being sarcastic in my first comment as it seem it didnt come out the right considering your reply I hated the ending to lazarus and feel he got that ending since people complained about w3 story too much.
---
You can have fun on your own for sure just be active in chat and joke around. But i do rec finding a group of people you end up liking and play the game with. This is coming from someone who has played almost every game solo, never stuck around in clans/guilds and finally found a guild and has stayed eith for almost 2 years now
---
Pretty weak, but still a massive dragon.
---
yeah sure they should have never added the only interesting piece of pve content this game has, lets just faceroll more 10mn fractals and complain when any kind of content that requires minimal effort is added and watch the game die in 2 years =)
---
I've opened a ticket and there is an option about recovering deleted characters. I was very definitive about my character, it's create and delete dates tho. My character is +3 years old so i don't think there is absolutely no way recovering your character. They probably couldn't find it.
---
I hopped onto the next best world boss. Claw of jormag is a rezzfest. There is no way you can leave without a very good amount of rezzes, if not all of them.
---
Lone is ok with the right people its more fun
---
I play alone for most of it and I can assure you, it works. But dungeons are pretty much dead and you might need to use LFG for Fractals and Raids, although for the latter a guild would be better.
---
Catching up with mechanics of certain meta events might be hard too so I'd suggest the wiki. But usually ppl don't mind explaining to new/ returning players.
---
For the social aspect if the game I chat or join map zergs. 
---
For everything else I walk alone. I walk alone.
---
No ring? :P
---
This ^
---
Also there was a comment a while back from a dev that said if you for example made a lot of key runs and there for have a lot of created characters over the years it will deffo be much harder to find them.
---
NO. No more raids. I want open world. I want to 1111 stuff. Go play some other game.
---
The game went from a believable shanty town (even if it was weird that it never changed over the years) to a believable pile of rubble after one of the most fascinating pieces of storytelling I have **ever** seen in a MMORPG (because the story moved with or without my hand in it, it just... happened!), to... a marine themepark.
---
Modern LA isn't **bad**, but it's disappointing compared to what came before it. :(

No one thing GW2 does better than any other MMO is it separates main story and side stories. In WoW you kill the lich king the main boss in a raid in GW2 they do not lock main story behind raids even the first couple with the white mantle was technically a side story that bled its way into main story.

I think it would be much better, if she was returned in the middle of episode, but not in the first couple of minutes. Like The Commander goes to cover retreat of survivors, Aurene's body being moved to another place for proper rituals (Crystal Bloom might be introduced here, they could, for example, volunteer for this mission and prepare her for rest), everything is bad, people are broken, Branded are strong, The Commander holds them and grieve about their loss (maybe a little bit of Sergei vibes here, if you know him); maybe even some timeskip to show us that some time passed, even if it's several hours. Commander starts getting overwhelmed, and then KA-BRAHAM Aurene kicks in and save the day. That's where they could use the lone about "Brand struck in the heart, hard to mend". It would take one instance more for that, because Crystal Bloom could be introduced in the first instance, and the next is where Aurene saves Commander, *and after* that is chasing Kralk and so on.
---
And still it would be better than resurrecting Aurene in the first minute.

Twoloop waypoint was translated with two loops (Zweischlaufe) for years in german until someone noticed that  it is a proper noun. But besides that the german translation of core tyria story and text has way less typos than the english one. So it is not everything sunshine and roses in the source material :D
---
It’s disgustingly fine to play this MMO solo. Ugh.
---
The season is always 56days (8wks) and it is always 14-21days break between seasons to match them with the annual calendar.
---
The season is 56days is part of the timegate for the legendary wings “the acension” because the quest takes 15x4 participation (and you cannot get 60 in one season)
---
Aurene tea bags joko, all 60 of them
---
&gt; put more thought into skyscale than w6
---
This is hyperbole. Wing 6 is a *gorgeous* area, with a ton of unique assets and mechanics (moving platforms!) with a lot of voice acting and such. The story of Wing 6 is totally original, not going off of *any* established lore in the way that Wings 1-5 were "Hey you played GW1 right?".
---
I love to play alone!
---
Well, people are friendly, as long as you don't tell them they should improve instead of asking for nerfs
---
This game is a singleplayer rpg with a friendslist.
---
Great suggestions and details I didn't go into! I will say though that ascended armor really should be the very last thing you do once you're done with T3 fractals (51-75) and moving on to T4 (76-100) since you can do all of T3 and below without armor just fine and it's a ~2% DPS difference. 
---
I still find crazy how a question can be posted over an hour ago and we both replied to it within 35 seconds (?!) of each other.

Glint's prophecies and plans had nothing to do with the other elder dragons. She was entirely concerned with Kralkatorrik's demise. With this now accomplished, her role is complete and her story is wrapped up and done.
---
Aurene may yet have a role to play, time will tell, but it will be separate from any of Glint's plans.

Are you from Aurora Glade by any chance? :D

Okay wow i didn't expect that. Kudos to you, thats a tough thing to solo
---
this. They seemed to not realize most mmorpg players create human (or if feline exists, feline humanoid) females.  Just be clear here, most players still are male and find male characters gayish. It's a fact. It's rare you have a man creating a bare chest go wild beast of a Norn.   
---
What they should have done back then is a vote about which development way they should take. However, they couldn't do that right? That would be like saying they are insecure of the future of the game.     
---
 (pshh, reminder that FFXIV head did a vote on twitter if they should change their model to F2P+microtransaction or stay subscription based. So what did the community vote on? Hint: Players knew F2P meant loss of quality or thinner content.)
---
Well... don't know where your assumption comes from regarding the conversation chain that was explicitly about gw2 and overwatch. In both games there are no cheap actors. It is quite the opposite. Especially for video game voice work where most of the time va's are getting payed above normal margins to get them going in the first place or otherwise they would not leave there tv and series studios which will net them with more work than they can handle. At least in germany. So yeah ... that is the point. The voice work as well as the localization is on the highest technical level you can get within germany as well as inside the "barriers" of the german language. There are no "better" voice actors for both of these games. Only others at best. What was you initial claim.

Nuuvem (an official Brazilian retailer) seems to have "up to 40%" sale starting tomorrow https://www.nuuvem.com/calendar

&gt; and since they made it free I never played
---
Where is the logic?
---
I like to think Charr would build and set up a stable supply line / ISS, and upon making the first steps onto another world would discover the wreckage of several expansive yet exploded asuran bases, a glichy asura gate and a half-complete terraforming effort.
---
Asura would be first to land, and first to scrap the effort and move on to something else. Charr are slower but more resilient.
---
Looks like any random big dude with armor.
---
Try appealing it, you might get lucky
---
&gt;Great suggestions and details I didn't go into! I will say though that ascended armor really should be the very last thing you do once you're done with T3 fractals (51-75) and moving on to T4 (76-100) since you can do all of T3 and below without armor just fine and it's a ~2% DPS difference.
---
Thanks :&gt;
---
He's still a handful of daily crafts worth of days away from getting a full set, so to start working on it asap should be one of his top priorities. Also, take into account how many characters he can farm map currencies with. Winterberries really shines if you already have a handful of lvl 80 characters, but if he only has 1 lvl 80 character any source for AR slots is more than welcome imho.
---
&gt;I still find crazy how a question can be posted over an hour ago and we both replied to it within 35 seconds (?!) of each other.

Ah, gotcha. Thought you meant guesswork was involved because you thought it was randomised.
---

---
Yes it is, but the truth is we got w6, an amazing new environment, in September, we got sirens reef, an OK fractal, in January. Well it's the end of May and we don't have a single release date for another fractal or raid. I hate to be pessimistic, but it is an understatement to say instanced group content is on the back of anets mind right now.
---
It's possible. Depending on your skill level you might need to corpse run some bosses
---
&gt; no one complained about this one right?
---
Boy, you have no idea.
---
Hahaha this was the first thing I thought! Shame it's not Rooibos, but it'll do!
---
Rooibos or bust.
---
God forbid there exists any content that requires you to actually try
---
*shrug* Sometimes that is the only answer to give. True, Siren's Reef can be a nightmare with the wrong combination of instabilities, but SA is not among those. It's basically a non-issue in that entire fractal.
---
One of us, one of us!
---
That's the whole stich of anet. They use the promo art for their artistic trailers. If you want to prove your point you really need to give specific examples because I didn't see or hear anything that would ever indicate this being significant to lore AT ALL. Considering anet didn't even make up the story of how elder dragons came into being I highly doubt they'd do something like this...
---
The only dragon we actually saw more than once is Kralk and he was exactly the same (kralk who also was ENTIRELY different in concept). Or do you suppose he absorbed some sort of rock magic that turned him like that as well? Looking at all the elder dragon concepts the most true to in-game ones are those by Ruan-Jia who exaggerates the hell out of what actually makes it to live game just cuz it looks good, as it always is with art.
---
I've been playing several thousand hours of playing as a lone wolf, and for the most part, **you are fine**... but:
---
There are several modes designed for groups in this game, where you can use LFG or play with a static group. In **Dungeons** and Fractals up to Tier 3, you're completely **fine** using LFG (I recommend using a Guardian or a Chrono for dungeons). In **WvW** (I had a brief experience as a static player), once you know what you're doing, you can play in an open raid and be **fine** with it (success comes more from # of players knowing their stuff and paying attention to the comm than from extra layers or coordination, where the value is added *when* the players involved know their stuff and pay attention to calls). **sPvP** only "*requires"* a static if you're interested in ATs, but you can play soloQ and be perfectly **fine**. **Open World** and story, mostly **fine** as well.
---
Now, for **T4 fractals** (5-man PvE endgame content), pugging is really painful, specially when it comes to daily CMs. If you really get into fractals, once you're there you might want to **find another 4 players** to play with. Some achievements, like HoT's migraine, are really painful to do as a solo player, so having some friends is recommended. The problem with Open World/Story stuff is not 5-man difficulty but that LFG is rather dead for them, so it's hard to find some people for doing whatever.
---
And then we have PvE Raids. First ones you're fine, as you're still learning and excited and all. You can join a training Discord and learn all the raids as well. The problem comes when you want to raid regularly. I have right now only about 250li, done via LFG, and I'm really pushing myself into just getting done some of the easy encounters each week, until I get burnt out and don't touch them in one or two weeks. Maybe you wait for an hour waiting for a tank chrono, then the handkiter fucks up, gets tilted and rage quits, and you have to wait for another hour for a new handkiter. Everyone, standing still in the same place, for almost 2 hours for a chance to get 1li. Or maybe it's just Sabetha but people can't stack and ignore their big bombs, and ignore the green bombs as well, and the 1-3 cannon guy gets ultra mad and he rqs and you get a new one, and the same happens because the problem is not him but you're not the comm and you can only keep trying until something appears in LFG that is not a guild selling you the freaking dps-golem Gorseval for 80MC special offer. 
---
If you really want to **raid** (raids themselves are *really* cool, if stars align and you get a good pug group you'll get to experience that better), get yourself at least a few friends (chronos/druids/firebrigades if possible, maybe a bs, so ideally **at least 4-5 players**) or search for a guild or something, but doing them as a solo player is annoying and really time-consuming. Don't be the masochistic me.
---
Except that it can [still be bough](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gift_of_Quartz)t for 25 laurels and 15 gold, no one is left out.
---
Yes, i boosted my first character which was a mistake. The second one i leveled myself.
---
Main story should never be in raids until raids have a story mode.
---
Story mode should have all the mechanics of normal mode with more lenient damage numbers so people can use them to train and learn the raids, but no currency or account bound rewards of any kind, only a bit of karma and gold, and very small chances for tradable drops that can be already bought from the trading post with some grinding so they are still available without raiding.
---
Well, they also announced that they are working on legendary runes, so....
---
I know, that's not the issue. The issues is the missing years of gathering.
---
Open world is just playing alone together :/
---
My default mount is raptor and I WvW a lot...this has never happened to me either? Check your keybinds? I have a separate hotkey for griffon for this very reason anyway lol
---
Sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn't. More irritating because of this.
---
I think that using warclaw and playing some time in wvw cause this but not sure.
---
I didn't use Nuuvem but it should be just a serial key. If there even is an option for physical it's probably just a piece of paper with the serial code (I'm not sure if the expansions were even released on CD).
---
I bought the expansion bundle from the main gw2 website (so Digital River as the retailer) and got a single code that unlocked both HoT and PoF.
---
Unpopular opinion : 
---
I believe that this version of social awkwardness should've been baseline for the whole game with a hitbox that fits the character's size
---
Got friends? Dungeons. Don't got friends? Send me a PM, I got friends, and we do dungeons.
---
Super easy way to get exotic gear, and we can help you on a path so you can solo stuff. HoT was designed for people doing endgame in core, so it's a massive jump in difficulty following core story. It requires a little understanding of your class, and having a build and gear that makes sense.
---
There are chat methods still available. You can still use the friends list and whisper friends, you can still join and chat to a guild. 
---
Free accounts are restricted from using map wide chat and whispering non-friends so they can’t be abused by gold selling bots etc. 
---
Other than that the accounts are pretty open and plenty enough to get a feel for the game. The only thing to keep in mind is the story content in the expansions is significantly better than the personal story in the core game so don’t make any excisions based on story. 
---
If you end up like the game mechanics, combat system etc then you’ll really like how things progress.
---
Think of the mount as a legendary, it takes multiple days and different collections to complete. So yes, it's rather tedious and if you're like me, pictures and notes are a great help. Especially since this day consists of jumping puzzles in which not many players are graced with the talent or patience to get through. :)
---
That see with Braham dying of laughter and yelling PRAISE JOKO had my dying.
---
You are only looking at the overall shape. That won't do because of the different art styles. 
---
You have to look into the details. 
---
Take the Vigil cinematic showing the concept of the shatterer that looks more like made out of metallic bands and less crystalline. That fits how the branded have changed from their first appearances in core Tyria, more gray, less bright, with a different crystal style over their bodies, and then you have the new branded models seen in pof and the shatterer rework, that have deeper and brighter colors, with more crystal and and lightning effects. The branded earth elemental is the clearest example of this. 
---
That also matches how what we could see of Kralkatorrik in GW1 looked more like a brownish mountain, but in GW2 he's charged with magic and his crystals are bright purple, and his body looks more bluish like metallic rock.
---
As he and his minions grow stronger and get more magic, their skin gets more of a purple tinge, and their crystals get a brighter and deeper color and appear clearer.
---
Just like we have "Istan". Those are not zone names though.
---
Good bo... oh...
---
Then people would not run there with their mounts, showing off the skins so people covet them more.
---
I still want them to add "Fractal Rift" portals in locations that have changed over the years, allowing us to revisit the original maps.
---
That would also free them to make any changes they want without fear of making a drastic change, since we'd be able to revisit the originals anyways.
---
outflanked is way more dangerous in siren's
---
It's a 0% chance. There is no difference in eu or na accounts, just what server they're currently on. Server transfers(free if you have no characters) can change what region you're on just as easily as changing servers within a region.
---
They shouldn’t focus majority of their time on living story anyway but rather the stuff that can be done every day/week. 
---
Give more attention to wvw, pvp, fractals, raids and so on
---
Cheap xpac keys can be had from many 3rd party retailers, check first page of google :)
---
I think in this case, "since" is about time, not a synonym of because.
---
Direct salvage results do not factor in rare drops of higher quality. If you are directly in need of such materials (i.e. ecto from blues and greens) then opening is preferable.
---
If you personally need a significant fraction of the salvage results (i.e. T5 mats for precursor crafting) then salvaging is preferable unless you are an expert TP trader because you will definitely save the TP fees, potentially twice on first selling the unid and then buying the mats you need later. No idea when opening would be preferable to direct salvage in this case if you ignore the previous point, the drop rates of certain mats might be slightly different.
---
Dang it! I know a lot of Saffas are on AG, when I started playing it was recommended to me so I could join the SA guilds but to be honest, it never really made a difference. :)
---
Aurene: I see you have an undead lich over there

I'd just prefer if mount ability 2 would be free fall "stance" instead of descending, or at least make it a bit quicker.
---
You can get up to 15.000 achievement points from doing dailes for 1.500 days (10 ap each day; a bit more than 4 years). APs aren't really super important, but if later on you want to become an achievement hunter, it'll be good to have them. Also, free 2 gold and 3 spirit shards (you will need shards later for crafting; same as APs, they aren't really super important but you'll benefit from having a good amount sitting in your wallet. You can also make some gold with them).
---
Doesn’t matter anymore due to megaservers
---
Uhh, he used to wear dark spiky metal armor with red accents, now he wears dark spiky metal armor with green accents... Roughly equally "edgy anime evil guy" in both versions

All servers are effectively the same server for your region. It only matters for WvW.
---
No, its The End

Dragonflight is an effect you get whenever you lose control of your character during the chase

It's a common thing in cartography to not include possessives that way, or at least modern cartography because making exceptions for punctuation is a pain.
---
The old version felt "fatter" and he had way more presence. Like an evil Overlord type of Character. Now he kinda feels like something you'd see in a fantasy shounen.

Anytime I want to craft, I miss Postern Ward.

I'm hoping this provides some insight into the GW2 graphics settings. I've seen a lot of people asking why their game is running like crap and i wanted to create this video as a way of making sure everyone has a pleasant experience.  Adding this topic to make sure the reddit search engine can find it when people search for graphics settings. Feel free to ignore this thread if it's of no use to you :)
---
Also, i'm sorry for the length. While i'm sure WP would be proud of me, this wasn't really the time i had estimated this video would take.
---
Cheers!
---
45$? Holy shit....
---
This happen to me nearly always and i also have friends moaning about the same thing so it deffo is a thing. 
---
Just as maul do not work if you use space and hit maul it just goes on cooldown and you have to use x to get off your mount. Having to always be aware of not using space bar before maul is annoying since if you fail it you sit on your mount for a brief second in the middle of a fight until you realize that maul never happen.
---
&gt;Personally, I don't have the time to play raids
---
Anyone who says this is BSing.
---
You have time to

The old version looked like a goofy clunky toy model you'd buy at the dollar store for some 7-year-old into edgy stuff. Now he looks like he belongs in modern League of Legends.
---
Since when was every other player a cartographer?!
---
How dare you
---
As a general rule of thumb, I am selling the rares only if they are more expensive than an ecto. The greens and blues usually just sell them anyways if have a few, if I geather a stack and more during a farming session, I unID them and salvage. You can get rares from greens IIRC, sell them only if more expendive than ecto, otherwide wait or salvage
---
I think those Clean Air Vehicle decals have been expired for 6 months.
---
Servers no longer matter for PvE, and they "soon" won't matter for WvW either. Everyone gets lumped together dynamically.
---
I suggest finding a large roleplaying guild instead, since that will more easily let you switch to the map version where the roleplayers are.
---
It’s Rand 😅😅😅
---
That's not the case. 
---
Take the Elonian people. All new models, but there's no visible technical differences with core models. 
---
Karka models are one example of a new tech used in models that allows gradual stages as their armor breaks, but you don't see that used often after that. 
---
The new destroyer models in S3 are not particularly detailed compared with core destroyers either. They instead showed their change with colors to signify the new magics they got, and with size to signify the increase in magic.
---
The End is the first instance, then you go through the portal and a new instance loads, called Dragonflight with a picture of Aurene flying besides Kralk.
---
&gt; Rand
---
Oh! :D
---
&gt; Oh, i see. You're right, and i hadn't noticed that doing a barrel roll without gliding didn't drain endurance.
---
It does, but the endurance recovery is much faster than while flying.
---
&gt; Didn't you say at the highest point of your jump?
---
You will end up at the same height as the highest point of your jump. Bad description, sorry. :)
---
&gt; But it occurred to me it could work like gliding: hit spacebar to jump, hold it down to jump into a glide. Would that work for you?
---
I think that would be nice for both ways. Hold for no extra flap, double tap for jump + flap. :)
---
&gt;I am playing maybe 45min before work to get the daily done. 
---
Why is it taking you 45+ minutes to get dailies done? 
---
And why are you entitled to it? Dailies aren't a login reward. They are something you have to put a minimal amount of effort by seeking it. You can choose to do something else.
---
&gt;So no, it is not about "effort learning the raid" but rather that I want to spend my time doing something else
---
So do something else. But don't demand ANET dumb their game down because you are bad at time management.
---
If you'd rather do other things than raid, then don't raid. But don't act like you are entitled to the raid content then. 
---
&gt;Maybe I play a couple of hours on the weekend
---
So you DO have time to do raids, and you just don't want to. You are not entitled to the raid rewards/story then.
---
Never change your Audio Language... You get used to whatever you are using, after that everything else just feels wrong.
---
I definitely agree with it diving for its engage skill. Hell, for extra awesomeness it could breath fire as you do so, and scorch the patch of ground you impact at in the act of dismounting, rather than the little fly-away-and -immolate thing it does now.
---
&gt;Strange statement considering most people have a life outside of a casual game like GW2
---
If you have such little time that you can't raid, that means you have no time to do meta evens either.
---
"hurp derp ANET shouldn't put this collection for skyscale behind world boses!"
---
Guild wars 2 is an MMO where people are playing alone together.
---
They were more scattershot in their designs and artstyle compared to now which is more clean and consistent.
---
Zhaitan is the defining boss of the vanilla game, how would it add "very little"?
---
That sounds cool!  I never really looked at Scrapper because it seemed like that was the De Facto PvP build.  I'm definitely going to be looking at this spec today.
---
I feel like people either forgot or were never around for the battle for Lion's Arch, where Evon Gnashblade flees through an asura gate then disables the gates from the other side, trapping everyone still trying to get through and forcing them to go back through the burning city they just fled from to escape via another route.
---
Fuck Evon Gnashblade.
---
&gt; "But Grandmother!  What big teeth you have," said Little Red Riding Hood her voice quivering slightly.

Heat is just a finite resource.  You use it, and then you have a cooldown phase based on your traits.  The holosmith grandmaster traits tend to interact with heat; expelling it, adding extra heat capacity/boon/enhancements or adding some extra damage.  It's a little scary at first, but ultimately not really a huge deal unless you're already kind of low HP from risky gameplay.  
---
The GW2 API is down which means that sites like Metabattle, SC or Discretize are kind of dead in the water at the moment.  The builds look fine.  You may want to occasionally swap in a Rifle or a Grenade kit. Open World isn't always melee friendly, and sometimes it just pays to set rifle (1) to auto-attack and kick back a bit.  So long as you familiarize yourself with the notes on offensive and defensive gameplay and get some practice in you'll be fine.
---
If Zhaitan isn't dead then the story isn't done. I don't know why you would expect that to fly for any non-raider.
---
&gt;Its almost like meta events happen multiple times a day, 
---
So do raids. Except you have more control over when a raid is organized.
---
&gt;don't require as much dedication 
---
Boo hoo. You're not entitled to the raid story/rewards then.
---
&gt;and aren't as much of a gamble groupwise
---
You're *supposed* to fail sometimes.
---
Being casual just means you take longer. So what?
---
&gt;And yea good luck getting into raids reliably as yet another Power role
---
Easily.
---
&gt;Anyway you don't seem like the type of person thats going to understand this, you're gonna be in for a rude awakening when you get older and have less time for videogames
---
N U
---
Someone has major issues, both video game addiction and time management issues, if they spend 45 minutes each day doing dailies before they feel like they can spend their time on anything else. 
---
If you have below an hour each week, maybe raids aren't for you. And neither is the raid story/rewards. Don't feel entitled to it.
---
Fact is you DO have time to do raids, because you have time to tailor your schedule to meta events. You just don't want to put the effort into it because you are addicted to a rewards skinner box.
---
Mystic forge for sure is the biggest draw to LA.... if you don't have a lounge pass. Today the only reason I'm in LA is to access the legendary crafters whenever I'm working on a legendary.
---
As much as I wish we had an elder dragon as a raid boss or any significant enemy in the main story, it wont happen. In my head the normal humans Sabetha and Xera should be able to solo elder dragons just because they are harder fights compared to the first try and success of fighting every elder dragon and sadly the amazing Joko. It sucks, but too many people will complain about this idea. I just wish anet would do it anyway, but yea. On the bright side the Wizard Tower might be a raid or lead to one.

Awhile back that_shaman found an update to the northern section of the domain of vabbi. If you use his GW1 map overlay it shows that the Hidden City of Ahdashim (the djinn hidden city from GW: Nightfall). Considering that the GW2 team said its continuing the Qadim/djinn story that makes the most sense.
---
Basically, Palawa Joko is an undead lich who played a major role in Guild Wars 1. He pestered and marched into Vaabi with his awakened troops and got challenged to a duel by turai ossa. Joko lost and got sealed "below the sand of elona".
---
When Abaddons magic seeped out of the domain in which he was imprisoned it weakened the seal of Jokos own prison. The heroes of tyria freed him to cross the desolation and gain access to the rift of Abaddons domain and defeat him.
---
Joko hated the sunspears and relentlessly pursued, killed and even turned them into awakened. The sunspears where the only force that could really stop him and with them out of the way Joko could conquer elona and rule over it.
---
A lot is described not only in the story but also about the history of certain maps like the desolation.

You are defining quid pro quo.
---
* Always open them.
---
* Salvage fine with basic kit.
---
* Salvage master with runecrafter kit.
---
* Salvage rare with rare kit.
---
You can also salvage any reclaimed weapons with a rare kit to get higher chances to get reclaimed plates and save coin if you are going for legendary armor. I have gotten about 80 ever since I started salvaging all fine and basic reclaimed weapons with a rare kit.
---
Many other classes can kill you in 2 seconds flat.

At least you see the fcker and can prepare. Unlike thiefs and mesmers who can simply kill you from stealth.
---
What do you mean, "openness" of its death?
---
Upon an Elder Dragon's death, the other dragons have been absorbing its magic power, Mordremoth started making Mordrem clones out of corpses (from Zhaitan's Death magic) and upon Mordremoth's death, Kralkatorrik absorbed both Zhaitan and Mordremoth's power and made the Death-Branded minions..
---
Even Primordus and Jormag in their "waking slumber" started creating new minions based off of Mordremoth and Zhaitans spectrum; remember Primordus' Death-Touched Destroyers?
---
Zhaitan's dead, baby, Zhaitan's dead ;)
---
Berserker (sometimes with a mix of Assassins) and Vipers are the top dmg stats, of course they are going to be strong. What kind of a question is that? Stat's never changed in game, class balance does.
---
As far as i remember there was opinion about glider, like "Skin for achiev? Will not happen".

memes aren't a good indicator of importance

'tsek with your Rooibos.

I don't get the downvotes tbh, because particularly the latter part sounds very relatable to me.
---
GS Arc Divider build that everyone is running everywhere now, you just press 1 button to kill everything
---
because you're the type of person that uploads a picture of a black screen like that'd help
---
Now THAT’S quality tea!
---
Sounds like a new djinn riddle.
---
I don't mind the subs themselves, it's the smell that I can't stomach. A sort of sickly sweet sauce smell that's so strong you can smell it in the street, almost as if it's a fast food joint. The smell inside is even worse, when they could have the smell of fresh bread instead.
---
People are still crying about thieves in 2019? The class is a joke in PvP. Git gud!
---
This is about the warrior elite specialization, not the stat combination.
---
I did a bit of searching for you and found this: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3a3rfv/random_black_screen_issue_fixed_finally/
---
Hope it helps more than your screenshot :p
---
As op's wish comes true, everyone in LA hears a voice in the wind "Alright hello hello hello everyone, welcome welcome"
---
It cannot be, because the elite is not that difficult to deal with and can't really do one shots unless you like to stand still and look at them while they do an Arc Divider. 
---
Most of the time they charge in with their stances up or stacking knockdowns, and you just have to stay back, wait them out, and them counter attack.
---
Does anyone know how much worse Hybrid Weaver (with greaving gear, like this https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9ed911/gw2_hybrid_grieving_weaver_34193k_small_hitbox/) is compared to meta power Weaver in fractals? I really don't like the way Power Weaver (or tempest, for that matter) plays, since I really do not enjoy the conjured weapons... Would I be holding back my groups since I cannot burst as hard? Or is that only an issue for "speedrunning" groups? (Playing with friends, currently in low T3 fractals)
---
Yeah, true. Though, I've always used my class skills over those anyway, I guess.
---
Oof if so, I'm sorry OP, I can agree with you if you're talking about a class balance :)
---
Honestly, I didn't even know lounges existed until today. Just got back into the game after a 4-5 year hiatus so missed a lot. Got the new expansion and didn't realize it have me a lounge pass.
---
This topic reminds me Dragonriders of Pern book series :-D
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pern_books
---
You're right, conjureds dont add much on small hitboxes and elite FGS is insignificant in all scenarios.
---
I finished it a few hours after that, but thanks.
---
I'd rather see a large scale map event for him, maybe in the future LS or something, as putting Zhaitan in a raid would just cause a bunch of complaints from non raiders and the open world stuff is more popular in the first place.
---
Roleplay has in been a steady decline for a few years now and it has a hit a whole new low when it comes to EU. If you truly wish to dedicate your time into roleplaying, I'm afraid you would have much better luck searching in the NA servers (and sacrifice your sleeping schedule for it as a result). 
---
There has been too much drama going on when it comes to guilds over at EU that the majority of people interested in this kind of thing have either left or bubbled themselves up with friends. There are only a handful of guilds that can still be considered 'active' on EU, but they aren't anything special and are known for their share of problems and restrictions.
---
As much as the Olmakhan could be a natural splinter group for a society that is completely devoted to violence. I still feel they were created partly to have charr in the story while being able to write them more like regular humans.
---
but that is expanding the story. He's now alive after you would have killed him in the personal story, even if only for 10 minutes. Not to mention the lore implications of having you PC both on an airship and also on the ground; unless it's a random group of adventurers that are the real slayers of Zhaitan
---
You can try the [Official GW2 Support page] (https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/115015860488-Error-Code-42) on this error code. 
---
My advice would be to put an exception in your firewall for the ports (80, 443, 6112) specified on that page. You can find instructions to aid you in doing that on the page.
---
Nope, I get the same FPS at 1080p as I do at 4K. In either GPU utilisation is no where near maxed. Definite CPU bottleneck. 
---
Of course this doesn’t mean a ten year old budget GPU will run the game perfectly.
---
probably pvp.. with 20 chars its normal
---
Totally fine to play alone. It's one of the reasons I love the game is because I personally can't commit to a lot of time. I can still be social on my own time
---
They call them balance patches. I call them new meta patches.
---
I'm guessing responding here might be a touch futile, but having the time for meta events in absolutely no way suggests having the time for raids, flexible schedule or not. Raids have an organisational barrier, a practice barrier, a knowledge barrier and a time spent failing barrier. If you have a challenging schedule, or work from home, it is far easier to quickly spend 10 minutes on a meta than it is on even trying to put a raid group together, never mind getting a kill.
---
Of course, all of this just demonstrates why there should be an easier difficulty for raids. There are plenty reasons for why people don't raid currently and, valid or not, less people raiding means the resources being used to make that content aren't utilised fully by the community. Easier difficulties would be a good thing for people with difficult schedules or fear of getting into raids and, more selfishly, might result in worthwhile repeatable difficult raid content.
---
The mods delete a lot of memes for some reason.
---
I have like six 4+ year old characters that have at max 2% map completion.
---
I am one of those thiefs.
---
I only play WvW.
---
Tybalt would be proud of all the apples
---
You expend half your energy, and regain flight juice when you have the third mastery. So you launch up, and can even fly further up. Griffon wasn't that great without maxed mastery either. 
---
I think it's pretty great tbh. And it'd be broken if you could trick it into climbing on walls, as most walls aren't straight vertcal cliffs.
---
I used to post my outfits there a lot, and rated and commented on a few. Heck, I still even have a few screenshot sets I was thinking about posting on there, but haven't really felt the need to.
---
I think there are a few reasons why I slowly started moving away from the site. 
---
Firstly, it started feeling a bit demanding. At first you could post your character, with two or three more screenshots to give a better impression of their attire. However the last time I posted I was bugged into posting more screenshots of my character. Looking around, it seemed like people were uploading eight to ten screenshots per look. 
---
Secondly, it felt like people cared more about the presentation than the actual armor/dye combinations. When I was my most active, it always seemed the the characters with the most flashy looking main photo always got the most votes. Heck, for their Look Battle section they had to make a rule to NOT have a picture that was  photoshoped as the main/preview screenshot.
---
Overall, it felt like the outfits weren't really what people would focus on, so I kind of lost interest in posting there. Maybe I misinterpreted the culture, or just posted on bad days, but that's how it felt to me every time I posted on there.
---
The website itself is just not very good - it's annoying to navigate. On top of that, there hasn't been a consistent stream of new armors to come out.
---
Out of the loop. Can someone ELI5?
---
I don't do my dailies every day but at least every other day it feels like sirens reef and deepstone end up as a daily or rec. Tbh I think the last boss of sirens reef is the only super obnoxious part. Idk. I think it's silly to tell people to just not do it. That feels like you're damned either way. If you do it you complete your dailies and get your rewards but have to deal with sirens reef. If you don't then you lose out on rewards and people hate missing out on shit. I think the complaints on reef are valid.
---
This is pretty damn accurate. It was more to do with the presentation of your character than the actual skins and dyes.
---
Russian profanity arranged in a way so that it sounds like the name of the gen 2 legendary shortbow.
---
May I ask why you merch the green stuff instead of using the rubecrafters salvage thing on it? I've been doing that and getting decent symbols etc.
---
Ohh man, can’t wait!  I hope it comes with a full underwater season and maybe some underwater wvw maps... 
---
/s
---
Just to say that Logan is dubbed in french by the same guy that dubbed Thor (Chris Hemsworth) in the MCU.
---
Good explanation.  I was looking at heat the same way I looked at the revenant resource, already forgotten the name.  I was horrible at it lol.
---
I actually reported myself for a name recently.  I don't remember how i decided that was a good name and it was great for a sylvari necromancer but oh so inappropriate... but most importantly... I HAD SPELLED IT WRONG.
---
Couldn't live with a misspelled name.
---
Why "I made my first legendary after 6 years" threads get more upvotes than Fractal solo's?
---
Because you fully a trident pre as a drop?  I get making one later, but as your first has me intrigued.
---
Gotcha. That’s pretty funny, but why force him to change his name? Is it really *that* bad of an obscenity? What’s the translation?
---
&gt; Of course, all of this just demonstrates why there should be an easier difficulty for raids.
---
I fully support introductory tutorial raids. We need more introductory content to teach players team structure. More things like Secret Lair of the Snowman.
---
I do NOT support an easy mode for existing raids like Dhuum. Killing Dhuum should be an accomplishment that requires the whole team to work together. Same with Matthias, Sabetha, Keep Construct, Xera, and Qadim. 
---
&gt; If you have a challenging schedule, or work from home, it is far easier to quickly spend 10 minutes on a meta than it is on even trying to put a raid group together, never mind getting a kill.
---
Doing an event for 10 minutes may be easier. So what's the point?
---
Not every breathing minute a player is logged in should be constantly rewarded. God forbid a player earn a ill over a difficult boss.
---
Honestly what GW2 needs before doing that is what FFXIV does for their raids. Every raid has two difficulties, savage and normal. Normal is for more casual players to experience the story, while savage is for the actual raiders.
---
For rewards, normal raids give players weaker versions of the savage gear that can't be dyed. GW2 could do something like that. Make normal raids in GW2 give exotic gear that's not as fancy as the higher difficulty versions. This allows casual players to experience the raid story while also being teased into the harder raids for fancier versions of what they get in normals while still giving hardcore raiders what they want.
---
What part of "games should be fun, and if you hate this piece of content so much, don't play it" is silly?
---
It's a game, not a job. So you miss out on a little bit of daily reward; so what?
---
Ah, Aurene's favorite brand.
---
This post makes very little sense to me, unless your message here is that if you stand alone in the middle of nowhere with no players near you, you have like 340 FPS, while your GPU is running on 100%.
---
&gt;Bitch and Champafuck
---
Love it
---
Very good text explanation. More than  actual player need to know this.
---
It’s probably one of the most common insults.  “Fucking bitch.”
---
Agreed. I5 8400 would be a huge improvement and the non k is pretty cheap.
---
I guess that's because cloth and metal are relatively cheap compared to wood and especially leather, while symbols are varying in price and even if you get some it probably not worth it
---
oh wow, congrats
---
Finally someone who's not calling him a major character in GW1. He's pretty important in the overall lore of the series, sure, but as far as GW1 goes he shows up suddenly, teaches you how to ride Junundu, then chills out at the bone palace as an npc for the rest of the game. He's literally a minor one-off quest npc. (He does show up in the norn fighting tournament too, if you want to be picky.)
---
There really wasn't anything believable about old LA, at all. It screamed "game environment" with very little in the way of town going for it.
---
Ruined LA was the best in terms of usability and believability, but new LA by far makes more sense as a inhabited town, instead of a level designer's fever dream.
---
If istan taught us anything it's that people value the shit out of rewards. I already explained why "just don't do it lol" is silly but you only seemed to attach yourself to that part of my comment.
---
Give us a legendary Pegasus skin 😍
---
This has been bugging me for quite a while, but I eventually found a workaround: not going to WvW.
---
Shouldn't the Big bad wolf be wearing a grandma outfit?
---
Screenshot from phone. Reeeeeee.
---
They've had 6 years to do story mode, they can't complain.
---
This is very much what i'm saying. Unfortunately i seem to have limited my fps to 120 with 3rd party tools meaning i wasn't properly able to show this off. When there is noone around your cpu doesn't have to do too many calculations. This means your cpu is able to send a lot of drawcalls to your gpu. Your gpu will then (depending on the cpu / gpu speed relative to eachother) try and create all the frames your cpu is requesting. 
---
When your cpu is asking for 200 frames but your gpu can only handle creating 120, your gpu is the bottleneck. When your cpu is the bottleneck however, you gpu will simply be underutilized because it's nowhere near the max amount of frames it can create.
---
In the end if your cpu can provide enough frames to max out your gpu, your gpu will be the bottleneck. When it can't, your cpu is the bottleneck.
---
The problem with gw2's engine is that it relies very heavily on a single core and is thus incapable of dealing with the calculations required to keep track of all the other players. This is why high single core cpu's are generally better. If your cpu was able to utilize my 8c/16t for example, my gpu would most likely be at 100% at all times because it's being asked to create way more frames than it can handle.
---
Sorry for the huge wall of text. I went on a bit of a ramble and am currently at work so i can't structure it properly
---
Well officially it was US-only so only intended for those living in the US, but yes, it was possible to obtain a code with a VPN
---
I will look into this . I'm assuming i messed up my game design knowledge here. Thanks for pointing it out. I'd hate to spread false information so i hope people see this :)
---
"was" its not possible anymore even of I live in the us?
---
Nope, the event ran for a week but they ran out of outfit codes within ~12 hours
---
Idk I lay waste to things in the lower zones I used to struggle in. Combo of better better and knowing my character and having good gear. Explain that you can't lay waste in low level zones?
---
oh, do you think there's someone on reddit that have an extro code and be willing to share it? (maybe stupid question)
---
This isnt the place for advertising guilds fyi.
---
There must be so many new things to see and do!!
---
Well I guess you’ll find out. I only commented to you let you know it will return at some point in the future
---
Wish me luck, thanks for the info!
---
I think when they changed the voting system from simple medals to the sliders with topics like "screenshots", "description" etc. the people simply went with that concept instead of just voting on the look alone.
---
Personally, i really enjoyed the slider-system, since people got quite creative with screens and stories, which was a blessing to the looks. Seeing them in a cool environment with cool poses etc. was much more exciting than just a screen from LA or the login-screen.
---
I understand why people wouldnt want to invest that much effort into their uploads though.
---
Why do we still give advice to learn a character from lvl 1 in GW2? Other MMOs I can see but here with these mechanics? How does fighting lvl 5 gral prepare you for various mechanics in lvl 80 fights with your prestige class?
---
Yes you can do it solo.
---
No you don't have to lvl up a character to learn how to play.
---
You get two prestige classes with the expansions that have different mechanics from your main class. 
---
LS episodes offer mechanics and tricks that don't come up in classic zones.
---
Reading through those patchnotes, this seems like the PoF 2.0 patch. Increased rewards for all metas, upped droprate for the rare minis (e.g. djinns)...
---
i wish the bot can find some of my old posts about Joko Coco To-Go is Loco. we made so many run ons
---
And to think, some people thought that the Skyscale was meant to be the season's legendary collection.
---
Damn maa - the surprises in this patch @&gt;@
---
&gt; Note: Parts of this collection require acquisition and mastery of the skyscale mount,
---
Welp, fuck that then. Not happening.
---
Hm, I see you didn't play for that long or did you simply forget?!
---
Arah Story path is mandatory to complete the personal story. It was also a group instance at release until they changed it because the community complained about it being locked behind a group. They also complained that dungeons were too hard.
---
I agree with the part that a personal story part shouldn't be dependent on the success of your group but I disagree with it being the way it is now.
---
No, You don't need story mode dungeons to take players out of their comfort zone. That is not how those story dungeons are because they are side stories except arah.
---
To get what you want you have to make the game harder, across the board. Give players the tutorials to know about combo fields and combo finishers, what break bars are and generally help them through learning the combat mechanics like buffs, blocks, invulnerable and everything else. You will not achieve that by putting story content behind a wall that they can't climb over because they only see the wall but not the rope that they have to braid themselves.
---
The comparison to GW1 is also weak because this is a hugely different game and was hard from the start. you had to go through a single tutorial that taught you the lessons and then send you through countless zones like Ascalon, Kryta, Maguuma and then Elona that all challenged you in some way or the other. You were decently prepared at that time and even then if you failed, you failed.
---
What this discussion is about, in comparison to GW1, would be to put the last fight against the Undead Lich at the end of the Prophecies campaign behind beating Urgoz Warren. The principle is the same.
---
So, Of course, you need to give the players some incentive to do certain things but, as I said initially, the community reacted already negatively towards a somewhat main storyline in a raid. This would be even worse. I'm up for more raids and there are many things that could get into a Raid encounter but Zhaitan is not one that I think would A) be very enticing and B) wouldn't make much sense from a story progression point of view.
---
This sounds really good! I like that they kept us waiting a bit with the trinket. People have now finished or are about to finish obtaining the skyscale so this is just in time to keep those maps populated even longer.
---
No idea what that skyscale chair is supposed to be though. I got a few vague ideas but they all seem really weird.
---
Oh god, and I'm barely halfway through Aurora.
---
Don't worry, it took me about 15 minutes of staring at it to work out what the fuck the statistics were trying to say xD
---
there's nothing wrong. 250 isn't much.
---
actually it says you need to have the skyscale done, so i really hope you dont need 250x6 again lol
---
NOO! I always used to see your charr waiting for the wyvern at VB, your name never failed to give me a good chuckle.  
---
So long, soldier.

---
what about it?
---
Wait wdf is the Raid Leggy Ring out?
---
What about them?
---
That was a damn good name. :&lt;
---
Really weird, it's like they knew exactly what they needed to change in PoF but decided to wait a year or so to actually do it.
---
now thats what I call a good patch
---
Likely they wanted to give people a couple of weeks to get the mount as it looks like you need to have it to help with the legendary.
---
I need that skyscale chair :/
---
Today's patch gonna be lit!
---
It's abusive.
---
&gt; As such, ranger shout skills have been reclassified as command skills rather than shout skills.
---
If PoF wasn't already released, I'd say that sounds very Paragon-esque.
---
It remains to be seen if the increased rewards and changes for PoF metas will usurp HoT metas (they probably won't), but they'll go a long way to at least giving players options, which is never a bad thing. PoF maps will have a nice non-skyscale uptick in activity for a bit, at least.
---
Music boxes drop rate buffed and trade able?! Oh lets go
---
Why not both
---
This seems like an awesome patch! New legendary trinket, better rewards for the PoF-Meta events and the gear rework! Good job A-net!
---
With the next wing
---
Nope. The one from today's patch is new trinket (the 3rd one).
---
&gt;Hm, I see you didn't play for that long or did you simply forget?! (Not judging, just curious)
---
I remember when Arah Story Mode was mandatory.
---
I'm saying every other dungeon should've been mandatory too.
---
The controversy over Arah Story Mode is BECAUSE the game did not force players to group up at lower levels. Doing it right at the end was a shock.
---
Oh, and apparently the new raid (next month) is the Key of Ahdashim! [(Mentioned here.)](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/dont-forget-to-select-your-attributes-in-todays-release/) People did expect it to be in the hidden city, and I suppose the name is talking about a key to unlock access either to the city or to that huge golden vault from the end of the GW1 mission.
---
Yeah lol, I seriously would of put down money on the skyscale skins coming today, at least the 2000 gem one but nope. Chair.
---
So their was actually a cancelled map/ dungeon from launch that would have had us running around zhaitan corpse. Sadly the only we got to see of it was the map data.
---
&gt;Ysshi Hessani's base health has been reduced by approximately 15%.
---
&gt;Pek Rakt Grag's base health has been reduced by approximately 10%.
---
Why?
---
If anything, these bosses needed a buff...
---
Took them long enough...
---
To be honest, now is the best time to implement this change. These metas will be much more popular while waiting for season 5.
---
Uh never hopefully? There are 2 scenarios this happens both of which are easily avoidable.
---
1.) You're running around in PvP and WvW in full glass berserker gear with no defensive stats, in this case you should be getting pretty much 1 shot by most classes. Next time use proper defensive stats or just resign yourself to dying to stuff like this. 
---
2.) You're not watching tells, most of the time the berserker will pop signet of fury to get full adrenaline before the engage, if you see that wait 1 sec and dodge out, you should be fine. 
---
Also for the record post Arc Divider nerf in order for this thing to do any sort of damage you have to pretty much sacrifice any defensive traits and go full offense so berserkers are easily CCable and kitable. Basically and I'm not trying to be insulting here, the only people that get taken out by this are people who are not setup or prepared for PvP or WvW and doing most things wrong. Adapt and you'll find berserkers are a huge joke, in fact core warrior is a far better straight up roaming spec than them and you should be far more afraid of those.
---
Hope you all allready farmed another 250 map currency after the skyscale for the new trinket....
---
&gt; All Path of Fire meta-events now begin at consistent times. 
---
whoah... does that mean a timed Maw of Madness?
---
Uh
---
As someone who played pretty casually I had 250 of each currency laying around (except the newest of course) so I don't really see the issue here.
---
Read the post? It's the first thing in there.
---
Welcome to GW2. This is normal. We want to throw stuff at people. TAKE. MY. STUFF.
---
Oh fuck, the skyscale chair is awesome. I just can't resist the whole dragon fantasy..
---
whoah...
---
Looks quite good imo
---
Feels similar to the HoT patch we got that reinvigorated all the metas and revitalized the maps.
---
New legendary trinket!! FeelsContentMan!!
---
Lol, a new legendary trinket comes before the legendary ring, which got introduced over a year ago. Sometimes I wonder if Anet is actively trying to bully everyone out who's main interest is not living world.
---
I wonder when the backlash from needing to own a skyscale comes in
---
I need a Skyscale skin :/
---
Probably a little bit of story prelude to the next raid release.
---
Necromancer tricks wolf into believing itself to be a grandma and turns it into a zombie?
---
Its funny. I joked about making Glint's body a gemstore chair and here we are with a skyscale chair. Close enough, I guess.
---
Oh, hey, they just fixed PoF.
---
&gt; New Legendary Trinket: Vision
---
Motherfucker.
---
PoF meta events rewards are now interesting, rejoice!
---
Isn't it just...like.....same as aurora????
---
Returning the game post mastery update makes each decision seem kind of important leveling up. If I recall correctly you can get everything by lv 80 and mess around with builds then but until then I would like the strongest build sequence for a necro wanting to use dagger main hand that will eventually spec into the reaper elite mastery.
---
sounds like something i would do if i was in starting areas bored off my arse
---
"Significantly increased the drop rate of the Mini Air Djinn, Mini Fire Djinn, Mini Water Djinn, and Mini Earth Djinn from the "Defeat the grand elder djinn" event in the Domain of Vabbi."
---
Holy shit finally!
---
Chests containing ascended equipment (Healer's Chest of Coats, for example) are now stackable.
---
A new item, the Ectoplasmic Stone, is available for purchase from Miyani in Lion's Arch. This item functions like the Mystic Forge Stone and gives a chance to receive new rewards from the Mystic Forge. (cant wait to try to see what pops out!)
---
The Zodiac light, medium, and heavy armor skins return to the Style category of the Gem Store as part of the seasonal inventory swap, which will continue throughout this week. (HEAVY HYPERVENTALATED BREATHING!)
---
I can't even feed my starving kids but I was about to drop my last dollar on a premium skin :/ anet really out here saving lives
---
I like this one, this is a good patch!
---
&gt; As such, ranger shout skills have been reclassified as command skills rather than shout skills.  
---
I though for a moment that since they change it to command skills  we where going to start calling our pets by name every time we use the skills.
---
ikr? im tired of waiting. wait till new raid wing
---
Tutorial raids are a waste of resources for Arenanet. Variable difficulties aren't and with an easier difficulty there is a better chance of getting some actually challenging repeatable content that will keep players like myself better engaged. It also means a more natural progression path and a way for new players to get into the content without relying on external community efforts. Raids in Guild Wars 2 absolutely suffer for lacking both of those. 
---
If that means an easier difficulty Dhuum (that rewards less and still teaches mechanics) then so be it. Dhuum isn't exactly a challenge now for experienced players and pretty much all the bosses you cite (bar Qadim that is already easier than Dhuum) are grossly out of date and in any other game would have been retired more naturally with gear progression. More challenging difficulties didn't remove prestige either from games where it was implemented, just changed the target of the prestige.
---
This isn't about rewards so I'm not even going to address that point as I didn't mention it in the first place. Metas are easier to do on a limited time commitment, that should be clear, and raids have that against them for attracting new players.
---
Fuck I get that makes sense because they are separate teams but, feels so bad to have that incomplete precursor and having to start on this one in the meantime.
---
That particular boss is also one of the more poorly designed fights. IIRC, big AoE(that is also a CC) on small platform. Hard hitting attack without much(if any) of a telegraph. There are also some pots of poison around the platforms for you to use against it.

&gt;Attribute-selectable gear has been updated with new choices in today’s release! You can read all about it in [this blog post](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/upcoming-changes-to-attribute-selectable-gear/) and find the full [release notes](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/77925/game-update-notes-may-28-2019/) on our forums.
---
&gt;Make sure to check your equipment and re-select attributes for any gear that’s been reset. The Key of Ahdashim raid is coming this June, and you don’t want to face Qadim unprepared!
---
&gt;#### Legendary Trinket: Vision
---
&gt;Relive your journey with Aurene and experience the past from a new perspective to craft this legendary trinket.
---
&gt;#### Catch up on “Requiem”
---
&gt;If you’re returning to Tyria for the Living World Season 4 finale, welcome back! We released three short stories exploring the thoughts of three of your allies between the events of “All or Nothing” and “War Eternal,” featuring art from ArenaNet [creative partners](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/meet-the-creative-partners/). You can read the “All or Nothing: Requiem” series [here](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/the-game/releases/january-29-2019/).
---
And finally the mini djinn source is revealed.
---
"[Shouts, now calledcommand skills] keeping their voice callouts and all their pre-existing functionality, but they won't be affected by the Rune of the Trooper or Rune of the Reaper."
---
Dammit, I loved Runes of the Trooper.
---
We already murdered our new pet and turned it into a chair? Damn ...
---
I think it allows you to pick a material (for this one I would guess a specific LW4 map currency) that you can pick up every day. Basically a customizable home node.
---
Achievement for djinn minis?
---
&gt; Added a rare chance to obtain Mini Air Djinn, Mini Fire Djinn, Mini Water Djinn, and Mini Earth Djinn from Superior Buried Treasure.
---
Probably more from this change than the other change
---
This chair is adorable and kudos to the artists who made it.
---
LOVED doing Aurora, one of the best pieces of content outside of Raids imo. So glad they decided to do it for LWS4 as well. This is awesome :)
---
It'll bring in a couple items from the map you choose. Mostly a few of the map currency (one of the 250 you'd need for the Skyscale), and some random other doodads like wood or ore.
---
Well, the raid is coming in June, so the Ring almost certainly comes then as well.
---
Meh even if there were 4 or 5 skyscales I will still have enough
---
I don't like the fact that this is the way we have to get new mount interactions, but ok. 
---
But, and I don't know how the code works in that regard, can we at least have the skyscale we use as a chair use the coloration of our skyscale mount ? 
---
And if possible, use future skyscale skins as well ? I don't mind them looking goofy or some clipping every now and then, but if I want to sit down with MY skyscale and not the default one, this chair is currently not appealing.
---
Absolutely this. I waited for a trinket since ep5 (because I thought it could be the final one) and was disappointed after seeing no trinket with ep6 release.
---
That's the tea, sister.
---
Was just about to post this! A sneaky little remark that they hid in the news about stat resets. 
---
Awesome, people really have speculated about the wing being Ahdashim, and now we know the raid is coming in only a few weeks.
---
omfg there's a huge nerf for the dozen of "shout' rangers. not even compensated with better cooldowns.
---
 Make sure to check your equipment and re-select attributes for any gear that’s been reset. The Key of Ahdashim raid is coming this June, and you don’t want to face Qadim unprepared!
---
Finally
---
They made the skyscale a lot easier to get though?
---
It may be related to a necromancer minion spec, which replaces our shroud with command skills seen in the Joko minions instances.
---
Probably next Tuesday.
---
Three months are over, so here's my promised update: Yes, in fact the Warclaw made me play WvW more often. First and foremost, because I had (and still have to) grind quite a lot of WvW XP for completing the mastery. Still, it's nice to be faster - although the mount is not as fast as I had hoped, but that may change once I get the higher mastery stages. I can't really say much about balance yet as I still lack a proper WvW build and armor. It's a bit sad, that WvW. Finally, it's a bit sad the gamemmode is kinda low-populated in the afternoon, which is my primary playtime. After all, I stll think it was a step in the right direction.
---
lol true. My guess is we'll either see them in the data mining of the patch for next week or next patch in 2 weeks for sure.
---
Might be something related to the next raid wing
---
New raid wing hype!! Do you think there's a current event in game?
---
Scroll down. They're all getting down voted in typical Anet brown nose fan boy style.
---
I'm simply not going to do a huge time gated collection for a mount and if that means the trink too? 
---
Well alrighty then Anet...
---
FYI looks like its been removed with the latest patch
---
This is exactly the problem I have with it. I don't like the idea of them selling us new mount interactions like this, but if it's the only way, please make it at least so that it's the mounts we have (colors, skins) and not the default ones. Otherwise it'll feel like a huge disconnect for me each time I use it.
---
There are some things to learn no doubt. However if the idea is to quit playing your level 80 and start at level 1 to learn something. There is the implication that something happens from lvl 1-79 that cannot be learned at lvl 80.
---
So what makes it so that a lvl 80 cant run out into dragonfall and fight regular old brand and learn to dodge and skill rotate vs being a lvl 10 fighting wolves or moas?
---
I don't raid, but that's nice there's new content coming out so soon. I recall there being something for non-raiders to participate in as well.
---
&gt; A new item, the Ectoplasmic Stone, is available for purchase from Miyani in Lion's Arch. This item functions like the Mystic Forge Stone and gives a chance to receive new rewards from the Mystic Forge.
---
Im excited to see this!
---
That is unfortunate. I was planning on buying one, but if it doesn’t even take the appearance as your current skyscale I will pass.
---
Legendary Trinket! And it's Aurene Themed!!! Now to work on that Skyscale so I can do this trinket! =D So, so excited.
---
What is there in PoF that's really worth farming though? I guess if you want some of the new armor sets?
---
From map chat, there are new ectoplasmic stones in the mystic forge vendor. 25 ecto for one. Recipe requires those + ecto + two other things that I haven't seen anyone find yet.
---
Some of my items that should get reset didn't. Icebrood horn backpack, Black Ice Band, Mist Talisman, etc. They got reset on the characters I play most often, but not some of the ones I play rarely. I have logged in to them all within that day because of flax farming.
---
The average player had a lot of difficulty with almost everything about the event.
---
I was just thinking this! Did they seriously forget to finish the ring?
---
Seriously, we worked hard to get our daughter, let us spend quality time with her too!
---
Do the 2 metas daily (north/south), then assemble the plate and find 9 Dwarven Chests in the vaults. There's 2 chests per regular room, 1 chest in the final Green room, and then 2 more in the upper hallways. You can get about 5 Jewels per day on average. I think the most I got was 7 or so.
---
I mean I wasn't going to do it myself because I hardly pve anymore. But hey, I'd do it for a legendary lol. Voicing discontent over content or its implementation is fine as long as its constructive.
---
Tragically, nope
---
I'm sorry, then. I'm at a complete loss. Something causing the key to be held down is my only reasonable thought.
---
Ooo can’t wait to see the collection, looks like doing the dumb robot was worth it!
---
It is working fine, but templates part is broken, for me do not change traits, other things like gear skills legendary stats work fine, but traits will no change even when you create new template.
---
wow
---
Nah, Aurora gives an all over glow effect, so I think Vision will be a halo or other head visual effect.
---
FeelsCharrMan
---
Holy hell, these meta changes are amazing. Maybe I’ll actually try to get all of the rewards for PoF now!
---
Your loss. You could easily just break it up and do it slowly at your leisure and have it finished, time gate regardless. I don't see why you have to be able to do it all in a day in order to bother doing it at all.
---
For build templates, only my legendary stuff can be changed.
---
Talked about it, people where saving up living world season 4 currency for this trinket
---
With this thing.. debatable
---
anything with core stats stayed, anything with PoF/HoT stats seems to have been reset for me. so zerker is fine, viper etc not.
---
If people are so salty about raids why dont they just......join a raid guild and learn??? Makes no sense
---
You can get it from the one in Dragonfall near the waypoint, it's in one of the tabs
---
Same.
---
This x 1000. Like skyscale is a tamed version of any légendaires. It's even worse considering the first generation couldn't be done in steps
---
I'm talking about the mount, which I did want until I saw the stupidity of the collection. 
---
The trink? I can get any Ascended I want just from farming my home instance. I've got enough mats already stored for 2 full stat sets.
---
hope your right!
---
There is nothing wrong with doing what you just said. I have said things along the same line in other places.
---
This is not about things that can't be learned at lv80 but not everyone responds equally well to being thrown into the deep end.
---
Haha I can't believe we're getting a skyscale glider skin before an actual skyscale skin
---
Guess they're giving people a little more time to get the Skyscale first
---
Its pretty strict tbh, but they can be slow to find you. I had flatulence in my main's name for a year until they forced me to change it.
---
Oh my, that glider is too cute.
---
I need insulin, it just gave me diabetes.
---
&gt;Forget little red
---
#Rytlock's calling the police
---
probably still coming with w7, as has been suspected since the release of w6, as that didn't finish it.
---
"Skyscale Squadron Glider"
---
We disney now, boys.
---
Damnit ... I don't want a skyscale squadron glider. Give me a flyping pig squadron glider -_-
---
Not only that but also added to the Superior Buried Chests from Desert Highlands meta
---
I rarely play any PvE and can't use the mount in WvW, so it's not a loss at all.
---
When I saw it I thought, ok. Then I saw the collection and thought, not ok. No loss at all.
---
Shouldn't it be Dragonroll? 
---
Wait... are we teaching dragons how put out a fire on themselves? Stand (stop), fall (drop) and roll?
---
See that's the thing.  I have a lot of none core stat like viper or griever or minstrel that weren't reset.
---
Yeah no skin until June 11th I guess
---
Well, in terms of open world content they still haven't peaked HoT.
---
No... skyscale skins?
---
Mystic Infusion, interesting
---
You sir are disgusting &gt;(
---
Guess no money will be spent for at least 2 weeks
---
Definitely not yet, but I expect we'll get there. Unlocking it does take a while after all.
---
According to efficiency, over 7,000 players already have it. I think it was about 40 on the first day it was possible to get it and when I got it on Saturday, it was still below 5,000.
---
40,000 players have the warclaw, and that got its own set of skins for 2,000 gems (which almost 5,000 players bought).
---
Does the latest update fix the Skyscale achievements?
---
oh....yeah, agreed
---
We can't preview the new trinket? :-(
---
The Stone does not show up
---
[https://i.imgur.com/WJWzLEZ.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/WJWzLEZ.jpg)
---
edit -- restarting the client a second time fixed it
---
New raid wing is mentioned in passing here: https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/dont-forget-to-select-your-attributes-in-todays-release/
---
&gt; Make sure to check your equipment and re-select attributes for any gear that’s been reset. **The Key of Ahdashim raid is coming this June, and you don’t want to face Qadim unprepared!**
---
[Emphasis mine]
---
My guess then is raid wing release either June 11th or June 25th.
---
Anyone have a summary for those of us stuck behind work firewalls for another 8 hours?
---
Mystic Infusion is interesting. I've seen some tinkering of the new Ectoplasmic Stone in the MF, I wonder if the Mystic Infusion is related to the new MF recipe(s).
---
So far a guildie found the Ectoplasmic Stone can pair with an Ecto, but nothing else discovered yet.
---
That's what I thought, too
---
well, legendaries didn't reset for me either. but all LS3 trinkets only reset if they didn't have core stats. all of my plaguedoctors also reset, while magi's stayed.
---
either way, it's obviously depends on each item itself, but I think those that were set to core stayed, but stuff that had HoT/PoF stats reset IF the item itself got a bigger selection after the patch (i.e. items that already had all stats probably stayed as well)
---
&gt; While the Search for Buried Treasure meta-event is active, Treasure Hunting Kits will attempt to reveal treasure that is not extremely far away when possible. 
---
Hallerlujer! When I was doing this the other night it kept making me cross the entire zone.
---
That legendary collection looks intense
---
The hero of Bag Wars 2!
---
That gold humble flex though.
---
Nice, we're getting a new legendary accessory before we can finish the legendary ring that has been there forever xD
---
I can understand that. I felt like murdering mine during that collection.
---
That glider is glorious
---
it's 8 dollars for a static pose with an item / thing we already have. if we're being honest it's really 10 dollars because of the trick they use where you can never just buy the amount of gems you need, you'll almost always have some extra that will make you want to buy more gems so you can use the ones you already had. you can be fine with wasting your money but don't try and lie to yourself and others about what it is, it just desensitises you to egregious practises. back in the day something like this would have been free as just a kinda cool unlock, it's sad to see the way MMO's and gaming in general are going.
---
Alright, good luck sitting on your skyscaleless ass when everyone's hovering on their dragon in Lion's Arch !!
---
I don't think there's a method to dye toys like chairs, but it'd be cool if you could
---
Feeding hasn't reset. Still locked for 24 hours, by the way
---
I have 3 of the exact same ring, with two that had reset and one that hadn't
---
Did it actually break or is it because you have a bunch of gear with selectable stats and now they have no stats?
---
&gt; And you haven't bought anything since the last expansion nearly two years ago.
---
I'd rather pay and have decent content than get fake freedom while every cool item is locked to the gem store.
---
Skyscale is totally worth it, and with this patch it's barely timegated now.
---
I absolutely love the  Torch²,  must have!!!
---
you could say it's a glory of dragons that's the proper term XD
---
I saw a guildie mention it can pair with Globs of Ectoplasm, sorry I don't have any more details because I'm at work.
---
Was inspired a lot by the latest episode, and decided to go ahead and make a fan trailer/tribute video for War Eternal. Hope you like it.
---
I can't remember the last time I was in LA. Mistlock Sanctuary Pass was worth it.
---
Vision looks like a "complete LS4 100%" kind of thing, which I'm personally okay with. As long as it's not tied to a raid, haha. I hope it looks good, as I wasn't a fan of Aurora's effect, but would love a legendary trinket down the line.  
---
The new community meta sounds fun (and trolly, what with a reward chest tonic :V)
---
The full text of the notes is pasted automatically in the comments here by the bot.
---
Stat select works fine. Skills and traits don't.
---
I think the exclusivity of old WoW’s raid content is what made it feel so much more rewarding than every other MMO today. Seeing things like the Sunwell was a lot cooler back then because it was hard to. I think locking the story behind a raid wall would be a good way to motivate people to play the game. If you want to learn the story without playing the game, there’s always YouTube
---
Seems like based on achievements its gunna be 5 tiers. We don't know what the other 4 tiers are yet.
---
What’s an easy class for 100 CM fractal?
---
...And that's the tea
---
Don’t get me wrong, I love all the skyscale stuff we’re getting. The chair and glider are both must haves for me! But when are we getting skins for the actual thing?
---
I'm not sure if it's poor wording or not. You could read it as set your stats for W7 and W6. Could also mean what you're saying - as Ahdashim will probably have a Djinn or two.
---
No its not because you are stopping people who like to play casually and for the story from getting to fight the main antagonists. Thats why raids in GW2 are good they decided raids are side stories.
---
I agree that it wouldn't be a bad idea to let people with the existing ones trade them in but the simple fact is that probably 0.1% of the population of the game even has these boxes. 95% of the population has no idea they even exist, so overall this is a good change.
---
Tons of new weapon skins. That’s odd. Any idea on how to obtain them?
---
I think youre probably right. Despite popular community opinion, the devs arnt idiots. They would have had to known the success and strength of the HoT metas and rewards, so maybe they were trying to make PoF metas feel unique. Ultimately HoT metas are strong for a good reason.
---
Well, nobody knows that. I believe it when it actually happens.
---
Our favorite ingame conspiracy theorist, Wild-Eye Miller, is currently gathering Mithril Ingots to throw them into the mystic forge, with no discernible result thus far. 
---
Have seen up to 23K ingots donated, but nothing is happening, except a bar that seems to never progress past the first 30% and Zommoros exclaiming that he has seen better.
---
I hope with the HBO series showing how horrible it was, no one reports my name, Charrnobyl :(
---
Did I see that ending posted earlier? 
---
Anyway. It's a good video :))
---
That explains why Astral Weapons were removed from the Guaranteed Wardrobe Unlock. But god, having to complete ALL of the weapon/armor collections from S4... that's quite the legendary. Wouldn't be a legendary without an obnoxious collection I guess.
---
Well regardless the breakage isn't too surprising **IF** we assume ANet is actively working on their implementation that they have said they were doing to do. Laying the groundworks for that might require changing some functions and/or behaviors that arc relies on
---
It's pretty damn lame, when it could have been just a mount animation instead.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm not against paying, but this chair is dumb since you're forced into the default skin, with no dye whatsoever.
---
hope its not dead or theirs at least an backup from it
---
game is buy to play. if there was a subscription i would been more critical, then again you have ff14 selling emotes for 12$
---
Some of these weapon skins remind me a lot of core game skins, in a good but weird way. Some of them obviously are core skins (literally the lion shield, and ghostly versions of some skins) but some of them just feel like they really fit with the old skins.
---
And I really want that [Scryer's Circle](https://i.imgur.com/wWunfie.png)!
---
No, just make it open world instead, like Dragon's Stand, specially now that we can ride airships properly across a map.
---
It seems like the map metas for Crystal Desert would be included so possibly all of the above (though I have no idea how Buried Treasure is a map meta?). Possibly not Casino Blitz but that still requires multiple players to coordinate and then destroy the Bonus Piñata so I'd guess if they are awarded then it's only if the map can defeat the Piñata.
---
Totally agree. I don't want to loose my prestige on efficiency
---
I delayed feeding yesterday since it would have ended up being 4 days anyway, but I didn’t see the change note.
---
Shield of the Lion is one of my favorite gw1 shields, I will get it.
---
I was able to complete the one needed for the new Legendary accessory at Necrotic Coast in Dragonfall.
---
Told you. XD
---
It should have been a mount animation instead of a dumb chair -_-.
---
shhh don't say it outloud
---
Never met a gaming community that matches with how nice GW2 is.
---
Magnificent.
---
Now lead the choya and rule the world.
---
They said they would change it in today's patch, but you're right in that it wasn't in the patch notes. Maybe they forgot to (or decided not to) include it in this patch.
---
Glad they finally realized Domain of Vabbi meta was unfun and insane
---
No, I'm pretty sure this always happens when new content patches are released.
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/dRbamC1](https://imgur.com/a/dRbamC1)  Some quick screens of new weapon skins o7
---
Did you find out what those tradeable containers are called? I dont see them in the trading post
---
3000 ? I thought you need 500 per astral weapon, and ppl said you need to collect all those. That would be 8000 of the map currency + same amount of rose quartz :(
---
You got to have the rare thing while it was still super rare, for months or years. You got the thing without spending hundreds or thousands of gold on the trading post. You *have the thing*. Why would you be upset that other people are also going to have the thing?
---
It's like people who bitch and moan when a game they paid for goes on sale or goes free-to-play. You got to have the thing the whole time, you clearly believe it was worth what it took or cost to get it when you got it (or else why did you get it?), and someone else getting it for a different price doesn't impact you in any way. Why are you complaining?
---
Leveling to 80 gives you enough to unlock all the core skills and specialization.
---
doing all the core map Hero Challenges gives you most of what you need to unlock one Elite Spec.. you'll be about 50 points short to unlock the last 2 items.
---
if you play a bit of WvW you'll get Proof of Heroics which you can spend to complete random HoT Hero Challenges.. just need 5 of those to finish off your Elite Spec.
---
Wow, so the mini really was just unbelievably rare after all.
---
Armor sets, weapon sets, lots of nifty tonics and minis, and just straight gold from stuff like amalgamated gemstones. 
---
I don't think HoT alone (not counting Season 3) had much more than that, right? Viper stats were super desired of course, but I think the big difference now is that there are many more ways to get the stats you want.
---
Oh nice. I bought 50 rose quartz a week ago for a reason I can't even remember (I thought they were going to go up but I can't remember why), so that's a few gold profit.
---
So the stowed visual for Vision is identical to Aurora? Do they stack? Will the unsheathe be the same, different, stackable, or more visual bloat? Can’t wait to find out 🙃
---
2nd this. pretty pweeeaaase!
---
The achievement is based on the amount you donate, so you have to donate 386 ingots for the full achievement
---
Which trinkets in particular are you talking about?
---
I don't see any problem whatsoever with a PvE exclusive mount requiring playing a lot of PvE.
---
Can we preview the new legendary trinket tho?
---
You need 6 weapons
---
Extremely hyped about this.
---
I feel like a kid at christmas that was hoping to get a playstation and got something else, which was still a nice gift, but then discovers that he actually got a playstation
---
i had equipped berserker trinkets that got reseted, bags and bank did not tough
---
Go to LA, there is a current event, he's asking for a bunch of mithril ingots near the forge.
---
they might be connected to those new weapons that have been datamined. if that's the case, rip me, my gold, money and lyf
---
The collection says you have to craft only 6.
---
No you can't preview trinkets,
---
edit: this ended up being a rant, so you were warned.
---
___________________________
---
Lmao oh my god. I actually didn't know people like you existed.
---
Berserker is probably the furthest thing from viable right now in competitive formats.
---
Even Renegade (power build not using Kalla) is better than Berserker because at least Renegade has a niche.
---
All you have to do is just focus the Berserker and he literally can't do anything. People are so braindead and used to not focusing a Warrior in teamfights, but they still haven't picked up on the fact that Berserker die just by looking at it because the toughness loss is massive and everyone just plays squishy yolo builds in an attempt to make the spec worth playing over Spellbreaker. It's like playing a much weaker and squishier version of Reaper with no condi cleanse OR resistance, is easily kited, has no sustain, has long channels with no access to stability, and zero LITERALLY ZERO fighting potential when out of Berserk mode. We even force ourselves to run Signet of Fury because Headbutt is so fucking slow to point where no idiot would ever fall for it. It's honestly more likely to get Aegis'd if they have something like a Firebrand on their team, in which case they don't even have to worry about it at all. **THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT YOUR ENTIRE ELITE SKILL AT ALL**. You might just say "Oh yeah, just run Rampage and stomp people," but that doesn't work with Berserker since the only decent skill the class has is Arc Divider, which is completely locked from you during Rampage. 
---
Playing Berserker in PvP is such a fucking chore because trying to make it playable is extremely inconsistent and requires way more than OP's pathetic description of "press 1 button and kill people." Good luck playing it against competent Mirages, Soulbeasts, Heralds, because you stand no chance. Any average player will just not allow you to function properly and it will basically be a 4v5 for your team because you're playing the worst goddamn spec in the entire game. As someone who has played tons of it both before the rework (when it was about as extinct as Renegade is currently) and after, the rework was nothing but a massive nerf to the class and made it nothing but a pubstomping AoE burst spec that does a lot of damage (not enough to 1 shot you like it was pre-nerf), but faints into dust when someone just looks at it. 
---
Berserker is garbage, you are garbage for thinking it's good. Fuck I need a new PvP main.
---
Thanks for this info. This helps me a lot in deciding.
---
One problem is the website allows you to create as many accounts as you like and spam votes with all of them, so you can spam Gold on all your looks to artificially inflate them, or spam a lower vote on looks that you don't like. (The site requires a comment for a very low vote, but not for high Bronze and low Silver, which will still hurt a look's overall score a lot.)
---
The community there a couple years ago was really clique-y, and if you weren't in the guild or friends with them, you were vulnerable to people being harsher toward your stuff, whereas they would go easier on their guildmates' submissions. It was pretty easy to identify when it was happening, not just people getting salty because their stuff didn't get gold.
---
The population's taste in fashion tends to lean toward "realistic" looking armor with "natural" dye tones, and at least 3 different armor sets per look. This is *really* niche, especially considering all the great newer armor sets with particle effects or otherwise shininess. GW2 is a high fantasy game, but people there prefer low fantasy armor setups, so...
---
Edit: And generally it took so long to prepare the presentation. If you wanted to be successful, you needed to have at minimum ten great screenshots in a variety of environments and exciting poses, and you needed to write a page essay or longer about the look's background. They're an all-day project, like you'd expect to spend maybe 10 hours just preparing the presentation, let alone preparing the look itself. That's too long, imo.
---
Aurora was timegated with the backpiece, I don't see how this is any different, except you get a flying mount instead of just a backpiece at the end of it.
---
&gt;I'm also very much interested in getting a Ryzen 3000 series cpu. Would it be interesting for people here to see a comparison between second and third gen Ryzen if i do decide to pick one up? 
---
Yes.
---
Also, I've tried the DX12 wrapper "add-on" that was talked about on this sub. It works wonders on the minimum frame rate. You should give it a try.
---
It’s not a sustainable price given how much of the stuff comes out of home instance nodes.
---
They're in, they're just not in the notes.
---
I like it XD
---
both will take approx 30min if you rush it properly...
---
If you're new and dont know what to do expect 1-2hours.
---
Also, don't all those metas give good loot/gold similar to HoT metas?
---
&gt;Last question, how do I choose which masteries I wanna lvl up?
---
Open the masteries tab of the hero panel (button at the button of it or click the exp bar) and enable the track you want to level. When your experience bar is full, open the menu again to spend some amount of mastery points to unlock the mastery.
---
Yay I love current event, thanks for the tip!
---
Yeah im kinda ready for some wonky ass abstract monster like Gorseval again
---
Anet actually listened, Impressive!
---
...the Skyscale is a requirement, so there's your time gate.
---
They were “dropping” but like, only a handful of them ever.  (I think it was like 5-6 iirc)
---
Could see a potential for other classes (most likely Necro) to get Command skills somewhere down the line. One of the common ideas for a new Necro spec would be one focused heavily on summons; a semi-permanent summon that you created (maybe with your shroud?) and then could command via Command skills would be pretty dope. I could also see them reflavoring the current Necro skills which summon a minion -- those skills flip to become an order for the minion, which might eventually be given the Command trait (though I'm not sure if there are any current examples of skills changing traits like that). Less likely might be other classes also getting some sort of summon as part of a new elite spec - a single powerful clone for Mesmers, an elemental for Elementalists, etc. It would be natural for those specs to also get Command skills.
---
I think the Ranger getting actual shouts might be less likely; they're an easy enough thing to add, for sure, but they'd have to do interesting and different things than the current skills the class has access to.
---
No way, final rest literally didn't drop. The event the dev said final rest dropped, was being done in a consistent basis by hundreds of people everyday. This event is incredibly well hidden and i doubt anyone ever did it short of achievements
---
I'm talking about other achievements that seem to be there, rather than the 3ap one with the title. I heard a guildie  mention there seems to be 5 achieves or something and that you can find them if you type mystic forge into the achievement page.
---
Could the ears PLEASE not come with the stupid forehead piece? At least remove it from the non-shiny version?
---
Might want to edit that part at the end about there being no trinket...
---
Isn't this the patch that's supposed to help with the Skyscale timegate too? Didn't see it in the patch notes, but I'm pretty sure they said it was gonna be the 28th...
---
That'll help with the Skyscale numbers significantly, I expect. I mean, I'm still falling behind on Charged Quartz (why tf did I have to make and sell those ley whatever tools? -_-) but only waiting 2 hours between collections should help a lot.
---
You have to buy something to get something...what's new
---
Never doubt the reddit arm of the community.
---
&gt;but all LS3 trinkets only reset if they didn't have core stats.
---
I had a Black Ice Earring berserker that got reset, and a Black Ice Earring berserker that didn't.
---
SO, in a round about way, are you saying you a little peaved that you opened your box and got a musical box - instead of keeping it like others as they can now sell high and buy it back at a lower price once more stock floods the market?
---
Yay the season ended and Anet didn't clarify us regarding the queue issues many of us experienced yesterday and also days before for some. Why shouldn't i get a try at finishing my last reward tier when it wasn't due to not logging in yesterday?
---
Gonna be nice for them to actually use their maps they painstakingly create and pour so much love in for 2% of the community. Maybe someone will actually appreciate them now
---
S E A  D R A G O N
---
It's definitely funky, people who have the exact same gear with the exact same stats are all reporting different things with regards to whether stuff got reset or not. It varies from character to character and person to person. There's definitely something weird going on. Hopefully whatever was used to wipe gear gets done again or something :)
---
So far two sets(back, 2 acc, 2 ring, amulet) of equipped trinkets have  been reset. One diviner, one marauder. 2 rings in bank got reset. Two back item in the bank did not(magi, berserker)
---
Whoa, they fixed Vabbi, the madlads.
---
Source for people calling BS: https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/dont-forget-to-select-your-attributes-in-todays-release/
---
Seem pretty safe to assume from the context that this is Vision we're seeing. My guess is that the unsheathed effect will be somewhat different to Aurora, even if the base effect is very similar
---
Unfortunately, for a lot of people I think Anet would need to do a \*lot\* of things to make Norn interesting. -\_-
---
Name a single collection in the game that you progress by literally collecting one item. C'mon. It's a treasure hunt around Dragonfall, that's it. It doesn't take long, and there are ample guides out there to make it even faster.
---
Skin gallery please and screenshots of whatever can be done
---
I think the reset might just not have worked properly. I had some reset that were equipped and some not reset. I had two of the same item ( Black Ice band) where one of them reset and one of them didnt. Hopefully they fix it
---
was one attuned/infused? I've seen more inconsistencies as well by now, it's kinda hard to figure out if there's any rule or reasoning behind it.
---
this guy is just epic❤️
---
That hovering hand over the one thigh is kind of weird to see in a promotional video for a release of a gem store product. Maybe it’ll look better on Norn and Charr for once.
---
Not unloseable, but clearly better designed with the current playerbase in mind. I dare say: 90% of the GW2 players are really bad at the game and they play mostly for cosmethics and socialisation, many, many people don't knwo what selectable stats or CC Breakbars are.
---
Making events like Serpent's Ire for a population that clearly has no idea what they're soppused to do without a commander super coordinating them (and sometimes not even that way, see Dragon's Stand) was a bad idea. I'm glad they made this change.
---
Exactly what I thought
---
oh ok didn't know that. I only crafted the Juggernaut and I expexted, that the newer legendaries had at least some form of collection to them.
---
Agreed! It's got nice moves :)
---
At least we can farm meteorites again. It's really easy to get if people do.
---
I am currently using that. It's used in the creation of this video. Thanks for the recommendation though. Spread the word, its good stuff
---
Only a couple of my trinkets in my inventory were reset but none of my equipped ones (same rings but with different stats) were. I really hope they do another complete reset.
---
Only in your head + incest
---
Just checking, but you know that Coalescence 1 and 2 require you to raid a bit already?
---
it's always like this
---
**Newbie to the game**: can you help me with the build? i am 80 with rare gear, it's condi  thoughness damage on a thief ok?
---
**Me, being a dude with full ascended set, together with half guild and other random people**: "TAKE THIS ZERKER GEAR"
---
[Can’t describe how happy I am to know where it comes from and why it was so rare.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bqy22l/who_are_you_and_where_did_you_find_the_mini_fire/)
---
Holo, warrior, dragonhunter, thief, reaper, and soul beast- in no particular order. 
---
Pick what appeals most to you or is cool in your eyes.
---
What about all the wanna-be "barons" that bought a hundred stacks of mushrooms and got burnt? Some people make it big, most miss out. You just don't hear much from the latter group.
---
That's only the first set of collections tho.. god knows what follows afterwards..
---
There is a "Mystic Infusion" in the data-mining post, it could be that.
---
I still found the Skyscale way better to do than any legendary. Legendaries are 90% spreadsheet bussywork crafting and crazy currency farming. At least this one was an actual long collection-
---
Noooo, we were fishing!
---
Sounds like you need to... lighten up
---
For me, it was character-based. The characters I played a lot got reset, but the characters I didn't stayed the same. Even though I've flax farmed on everything within the last day or two. Black Ice Earrings are accessories, so they can't be attuned/infused, I had 8, 5 reset, and 3 of the 5 had infusions. All of my attuned rings reset, and only one of my infused rings didn't. All of my transmuted back items reset(mostly Icebrood Horn Backpacks), but then again, some of my non-transmuted ones got reset too.
---
&gt; Name a single collection in the game that you progress by literally collecting one item. 
---
None that I know of, because I rarely do them. I'm gaming to kill things. 
---
I'm really not here to run to Place #1 and Press F, then run to Place #2 and Press F, then run to Place #3....
---
I'm sure you get the idea.
---
But wait! There's more! There's another collection you have to and it's so exciting! You run to Place #1 and Press F, then you run to Place #2 and Press F, then you get to run to Place #3...
---
I'm sure you get the idea. 
---
But Wait! There's more! There's actually another joyous collection and it's so exciting! You get to run to Place #1 and Press F, then you run to Place #2 and Press F....
---
Kill me now, or just let me kill 10 rats fer fucks sake because honestly if this is what gaming is coming to it's probably time for piano lessons. No wait... There is an F key on the piano too.... &gt;&lt;
---
&gt;Sometimes I wonder if Anet is actively trying to bully everyone out who's main interest is not living world.
---
Game's focus has been heavily leaning towards Open World content for years tho. Just ask the Dungeons.
---
Carefully. He’s a hero.
---
Thats a stretch imo, but we'll see.
---
I think we can unpin this now and make a Vision megathread.
---
wow o.o thanks bros.
---
New trinket. Is that another Amulet?
---
Minstrel Heal Firebrand, Diviner Alacrity Renegade, Berserker Dragonhunter, Berserker Holosmith, Berserker Chronomancer... those classes are somewhat meta and have excessive amounts of stability and class specific mechanics to survive properly.
---
Fractal CMs are no playground anymore, you are forced to bring dps and can't fail mechanics since they're usually groupwide oneshots.
---
Dodge Heal Druid / Support Chrono groups if you're new, those two are not as failsafe as they used to be (never were lul) since those lack defensives and you need to watch out for many more Boss mechanics. Join into Firebrigade Team compositions where the Guardian(!) is Healer and Revenant Support, those are usually the most versetile groups with highest selfsustain since Healbrands are usually more sufficient keeping people alive than Renegades. Also don't join into 5x dps where both Firebrigade members are either Fullzerk or Diviner, I know those runs and they're a clusterfuck as you need to play ultra clean and avoid to take damage on top of maxing out dps - that usually never works if you're new and even for me who allready clears it daily its a chore if you enter one of those. 
---
If you plan on doing it daily go for smooth runs where you have some error margin, joining teams wich group composition requires actual perfect gameplay from a newer player are those who wipe at Arkk five times and disband.
---
Raid specific chests (like slothasaur glove chest) doesn't stack.  
---
Hopefully that'll come soon as well.
---
In this case there might be a recipe that lets you go specifically for a sword or any other weapon which might be linked to the datamined weapons. I will try to find the last component, thanks for the hint!
---
How the hell do I enable the routes visually? I can’t figure it out.
---
Yeah, I think you're right. I remember farming HoT like crazy because there were so many things I wanted (mostly stats). Now it's easy to get them other ways so I can see why PoF never had that same impact to me.
---
I didn't see anything about this in the patch notes, and still at work. Is there a collection for them now?
---
You need to kill your mount to make the chair.
---
I've been calling the bow cyka and chunkybutt.
---
I like you.
---
it works with other swords. but you can't use 2 swords
---
Yea I did the same. Sucks.
---
Fascinated by these.  Could these be just another set of exotics to find as drops, or something?  They don't seem to have any consistent theme or relation to each other visually.
---
Could have just made it a /sit animation while mounted. Would have kept the skin. Guess we'll never see that now.
---
I do and that's why I'm not getting it. I'm a casual player these days and only get legendaries for the visuals - I don't like Aurora so I didn't complete it (although I have all the "difficult" achievements for it done), Coalescence is out of question because I don't raid. So I'm hoping that Vision looks good and doesn't require raiding because it sounds like a nice long-term goal to have.
---
Desert Crafting Material Coffers will now offer Flax Fibers and Pitchers of Desert-Spiced Coffee at the top of their choice list, rather than the bottom
---
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
---
I came back after a couple of years, only to find myself locked out of my account. I have my original key but don't remember my characters name (didn't play for long). I have made a ticket couple hours ago, how long should I expect to wait before a response?
---
Took me over a year before I saw someone mention it on reddit and felt like an idiot.
---
Best news today after the changes to stat selection.
---
I lost a few skins to that old transmute, including some SAB skins (that are still locked because I replaced the skins back in the day). It was a flawed system. Thank god for all the QoL features.
---
Ye I had same happen with an Etched Sword too
---
Ospaki is pretty much a high functioning alcoholic. He's never truly sober and it's never long between drinks. His father is a Raven shaman and passed on his spiritual sensitivity to his eldest. Ospaki wanted nothing to do with that "mystic weirdness", but gets all these strange and ambiguous visions at times because, well, that's how Raven works. So he boozes himself up as an escape.  You can say that he's trying to shirk himself from his duties, but he's quite a reliable and stubborn fighter. Ospaki doesn't rely on brute strength to win fights, using strategy and his guardian magic to try and outmaneuver his enemies. His magic is more potent to where he can concentrate his guardian fire to a point where it turns into electricity. And although he is young, just a few years into adulthood, he makes up for his inexperience with tenacity.  
---
  
---
Generally, he's pretty easy going and chill with a grin on his face if he's not fighting. Always up for a party and some fun.
---
Omg I just realized I spelled Canach’s name incorrectly. I was hungry and probably thinking of chocolate ganache when I wrote this.
---
Mithril - the new leather
---
Mithril Ingots just went up on the TP from 3.78 silver to 3.99 silver in less than two minutes.
---
wait what? it requires astral weapons?????? i thought it was weird enough i needed to go back and craft elegy armor. why am i being punished for skipping the basic step reeeee and i already spent so much time farming stellar/requiem
---
Hey that's pretty neat
---
Why did they add random metal pieces to the Shrine Guardian Ears?!? That's not how it looks on the outfit at all!
---
&gt; Increasing the drop rate is totaly fine, it took waaaay to long to get one by yourself, but making it tradeable completely ruined the feeling of accomplishment, since it's now worth just some gold, and nothing personal anymore.
---
Yes, which is why no one values or feels accomplished when they make Legendaries.
---
And here I was told before episode 6 that the only new legendary trinket we'd get was the ring. I'm glad to see the end of season trinket trend continue.
---
Thats odd, for me it wont accept the Anthology into the recipe...I have tried a lot of things including eldritch scroll, some orichalcum weapon parts and loads of different materials...nothing
---
Edit: Nvm i does now for some reason after trying several times over, same as for you tho with the animation and all
---
Just edited the post, got mine about 20 days ago after farming for about 13 months. And now the first musicbox sold on the tp for 700g...
---
You just need the skins unlocked, don't need to craft additional weapons.
---
I don't think the Buried Treasures have TACO routes since they're approached from multiple routes and it would just clutter the screen with all the possibilities. The icons help pinpointing where the chest may be combined with the Special Action.
---
Yeah but hot has unique infusions. Why would you do something else without the same difficulty for fewer rewards?
---
Id be okay with it because it wouldnt clash with aurora's colours, since you cant turn off trinket effects
---
Count me in for the Maw. Only missing the 100 portal spikes in Desolation and i really want the title, i gave up after a few weeks of trying to do it. Think I'm only at like 15/100
---
This update is more exciting than the last 5 living world episodes for me. All the pof maps are amazing in so many ways, and now (maybe) i'll get to play them everyday
---
Gw2 is such a wonderful community. I'm salty about balance and salty about Devs and salty about content schedules etc etc but we all know the pain of inventory management. I've probably sent at least 30 or 40 18 slot bags over the years and I know I'm not alone in that.
---
Åå
---
I've said it before and I'll say it again...nicest community in gaming!
---
I think it is more likely they are going to be giving ranger actual shouts next spec
---
Being a lvl 80 player in the starting area be like
---
**Me, a god in a glowing white set of armor, descending from the heavens on top your skyscale:** "Good day, mortal, let me be your guide"
---
Just kidding, I have neither infusions or a skyscale
---
Look in your keybinds for "Mount Ability 1"
---
I don't understand the part where the middle chunk of the story is gone? Granted I'm not the most well versed in lore or the most consistent player around, but I can't recall an instance where I balked at the suddenness of the events?
---
We got core game, Scarlet. From Scarlet we got LS 2 which gave us an entry to HoT. Following the events of HoT and the ley lines we got brought from Ls3 which wrapped HoT and opened PoF with balthazar, LS4 and cumulated into LS5 with Kralkatorrik.
---
Dungeons have been abandoned for a long while. It's not a lack of consistency if everyone knows right off the bat they will not be implemented anymore. They have been, since then, replaced with Fractals and Raids which have consistent new release.
---
World bosses of core tyria have been elevated to map wide metas since Silberwaste which makes a way more immersive and interactive event rather than a spam 1 festival.
---
Yeah, I did this when I played. Hell, I still send out gold and goodies when I log on and see a new guy playing the game.
---
I edited the post and answered other people. I have over 20k gold and the first box sold for 700g. I very much would prefer to just throw 700g at it, instead of having spent 13 months of farming.
---
Funny how friendly a community can be when the dev's dont make the entire game around players competing against each other.
---
Kind of opposite of the post, but I'm wondering what colour to dye the Skyscale to best match the chair.
---
But as it sounds now this trinket is even grinder than Aurora.. As you need Skyscale to do it (and Skyscale is so much grind that people actually assumed that it's there instead of legendary trinket...)
---
Ah ty so much &lt;3
---
I am bummed that I sold all my mithril ingots for the going rate yesterday.
---
Edit: I guess mithril ingots gets autocorrected to mightily.
---
It probably wont work like that seeing as though they will add skyscale skins soon too.
---
For what it's worth, I much prefer having the raid release on its own.
---
Not forcing people to choose between raid prog and new story content/map exploration is quite nice.
---
Well, NCsoft has them walking the plank. They either fix their mess and attract new players or they jump into the maws of a shark.
---
Not sure what this photo has to do with anything..its just a normal price inflation.
---
How do you have the patience to farm for a legendary, but not for the skyscale?
---
Good. At least now we can see they actually do something.
---
do all items with selectable stats reset? coz not all of my items with stat selects had a reset.
---
it will cycle to silk then leather
---
Lol same, 28k mithril ore yesterday for Exordium. Dodged the biggest bullet
---

---
That might be the effect it has when your weapons are away. Aurora has a similar effect on you in that state. But then it would presumably do something much different when you go into battle.
---
It will still take a month to complete because realistically there's only a set number of rewards you can maximally obtain in a day. True, artificla time gates are annoying. But each collection takes at most 10 minutes outside of the saddle because of the currency. And even that is now lowered by 22 hours for every collection.
---
It's not nearly as terrible as people. Make it out to be and I refuse to consider a time gated collection equivalent in grinding to any legendary currently in game.
---
Maybe it's because I'm used to artificial timegates from other games, so I don't find it nearly as bad as some people. I've had to wait multiple time to grind my way in mats and gold and it feels way more daunting that way than have to wait for a timer reset. At least I know I can finish it. It's not like any of the skyscale collection can hardly be done in 24 hours.
---
And let's be honest that the first generation legendary are even worse because of the precursor system that can't be crafted but must either be bought or looted. That is infinitely worse than the skyscale imo.
---
Hai Zhaife.

Well done bot..... Slow claps 😉

OUR KITSUNE PRAYERS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED

*Now, about that tail backpack...*
---
Anyone can say/link what kind of trinket Vision is and what it looks like for those of us at work? Estimated amount of gold to craft? Been waiting on a new legendary for a long time, I think this might be the one I finally do!
---
hnnng this is so good
---
btw, does any of you what the event does? I'm guessing something happens when the bar is filled up but I don't know what yet, it's pretty slow in my map!
---
This game is basically a massive sandbox. It's not a super deep one so you can't craft your own world, but this sandbox is LOADED with toys. At max level you can go anywhere and do anything,  getting mounts makes getting everywhere faster. There's gear, exploration, dungeons, raids, skins, events, races, pvp, anything you want. I switched from wow to this because wow was a game that I only logged in to do what the devs told me to do whereas here I log in to do what I want. There's no urgency to get anything done before it disappears. I'm doing some content from years ago and still having fun and making progress on my character. The sense of freedom here is really awesome and wow simply does not have it. Wow is much tighter in structure and direction and imo that is not good, I like the freedom

lws1 is missing

It's on efficiency. If you refresh the thread you'll see I've linked it in another reply.

(Obviously those aren't the exact numbers, only the accounts that are registered on efficiency.)
---
Problem with CPU usage counter is that for heavy multicore system you will not see clearly that  1 core is maxing out
---
im pretty sure its just the capstone achieves. im not home to check but thats what it seems like
---
Yea that'd be cool if they did add more features to the skill bar. Would definitely help my OCD LOL
---
I have never seen this. What server do I need to switch too every time I play I'm asked if I want to volunteer and change maps
---
They're also bugged and consume additional encapsulators if you repeat the collection objective...
---
Had 6 encapsulators in my inventory, ran the Dragonfall ley-infused champs, and it consumed all of them.
---
There's an achievement for donating 250 total, then one for 500, then one for 750, and then a repeatable one for donating 1,000. Rewards are just more of the crappy loot bags.
---
I think it's more like they didn't have time/manpower to make these changes while working on S4 at the same time.
---
This kinda makes me want to try this game, majority of the reason to play an MMO  is the community, and a certain MMO I currently play has next to none.
---
I just have a hard time getting past the “No Trinity” ie tank dps heal.  Such a staple to MMOs.
---
I killed a few for my beetle mount. Thought it was pretty neat so I'll do a few more next weekend.  I'll probably try to kill all if them at least once to say I've done it
---
I had a magi's ring equipped that did not get reset (Attuned Black Ice Band). A attuned viper's Black Ice Band (Infused) got reset, also equipped.
---
2 blues and a green! \o/
---
Anytime a friend starts the game, I toss them some bags and some gold. I've given such to newbies in my guild too. I think I had someone do the same for me as a newbie, so it's my way of paying it forward
---
&gt; then leather
---
and then no further progress happens
---
Yeah, but don't you need 250 to make the gift?
---
Here's some food for thought.
---
While the changes to the PoF Music Boxes are certainly surprising, they're not undesired.
---
Those who had found music boxes already have had their time of exclusivity, which is now passing.
---
As someone who diligently searched for them for basically over a year now, 
---
great enjoyment was already had in the process of seeking such exclusive treasure.
---
Having found three, I'm at liberty to describe this process.
---
First: Tinari's Music Box,  found within a Great Elonian Chest inside the Sanctum of Nabka in Crystal Oasis.
---
Finding it ignited my passion for the search, hearing it provided a comforting ease knowing its rarity.
---
They were like an aural aura with impressive range and enticing effect.
---
From there sights were set on the other boxes.
---
Began parking characters at random chests on all the PoF maps.
---
Came up with methods of utilizing Griffon Flight Adventures to fly to chests all over.
---
I would fly these patterns on multiple maps, daily from then on, for months.
---
Second: Nightingale's Music Box, found within a Bust of Joko inside a cave in Domain of Vabbi.
---
Was actually recording game-play while finding this, my genuine excitement humorous to re-watch.
---
It was the night before Halloween 2018, so throughout the rest of the event I would play my music box and haunted gramophone together in a sort of creepy hypnotic melody.
---
This was, of course, my favorite of the five boxes and having searched for months and months at this point (almost to no avail)  I was mostly sated.
---
From there my passion faded a bit and skip days for my flight patterns became more frequent.
---
And so months and months passed once again searching on and off.
---
Looting chests on parked alts, flying the patterns when I had the will to.
---
Third: Hafez's Music Box,  found within a Forgotten Debris inside a cave in Elon Riverlands.
---
Happened just this past Friday, believe it or not.  Was showing my brother a character who just so happened to be parked at a random debris.  Out pops the box right before his eyes and mine, much to my surprise.
---
So with all that said, my daily flights were mostly unnecessary.  These boxes were found randomly by characters parked  on top of some random chest that they had opened a hundred times before.  It's tough to say what effect magic find or diminishing returns has on all this.  Either way, that's how I found my three boxes, through my own diligence (or luck), not via gift or gold.
---
Being keen to their existence, I'm always keeping an ear open.  Can say with confidence that in my playtime since PoF release I've only came upon about a half a dozen players who openly play their box.  Though there have been past reddit posts where players have shown their collection (someone has four boxes, not sure if they got the last one) or described their search, there wasn't much interest remaining in the boxes.
---
Now, wax poetic over, 
---
Is a trade able container with a music box selection a "good thing" for the game?
---
Sure.
---
Do those who found music boxes previously have something to be concerned/bitter about.
---
Not really.
---
Does this change de-value the music boxes rarity?
---
Almost certainly; they were priceless, now they have actual gold value.
---
Anyway.
---
Anticipate hearing a lot more boxes.  
---
Enjoy the increased opportunities to find your own.
---
Give a big shout out to Maclaine Diemer and the rest of the Anet sound team 
---
for coming up with such a neat in game gizmo.
---
🍀 Good luck on the search for treasure!
---

---
I think the bar is game wide, and once it's filled the npc asks for something else. Pure theory though.
---
Theoretically, flipped engi turrets could also Count as commands
---
Yep, just lost 4 additional encapsulators to this.
---
This is one of those patches that feels like they actually care about the game again, instead of clandestinely shuffling people off to work on other projects. It actually feels like the attention GW2 deserves. Bam, legendary trinket. Bam, a bunch of data-mined weapon skins. Bam, reworked PoF metas. Bam, a bunch of QoL. Bam, new cosmetics with unique animations.
---
Excited to see what's next. It's a night and day difference when Anet is actually working on GW2 versus pretending to work on GW2 and hoping nobody notices.
---
It only affects the daily reset wait between collections, and feeding is a single collection
---
I'm a little confused on the stat reset. I have precursor legendary armor on two of my characters (one was sitting in bags, the other was equipped on the character) and none of them got reset. I had earned these through the collections. Was that not included in the reset? Was really looking forward to resetting those stats.
---
Can you give any proof and maybe show which ones you got?
---
Aaand *sold.*
---
PvE are mega servers so your server only matters for WvW
---
I'm not sure if you've stepped into LA recently but the fiesta over there is crazy. People are encouraging people to buy Mithril Ingots and trying to trick them into buying them and dumping them into the Mystic Toilet.
---
Plus, this:  [https://www.gw2tp.com/item/19684-mithril-ingot](https://www.gw2tp.com/item/19684-mithril-ingot) is anything but normal price inflation. This is insanity.
---
I think they wanted to make it less spammable, but they added a cooldown to it and also the 5s cooldown to mount up, and maybe only meant to add one of those?
---
....fair enough; just 1 atm.
---
It got nerfed as well from daily reset to a 2h wait
---
You must get tired of complaining then, because literally every release since Season 1 has had some kind of non-combat, exploration-based achievement or collection. Many of the biggest rewards in the game are tied to such things. If you're just looking for a murder simulator, maybe an RPG that is at least pretending to be about a living world with interesting, non-combat-related tasks and sights isn't the best fit for you.
---
Or maybe just stick to those parts, and don't complain when content that is clearly not made for you and you will never enjoy is continually released. It's clearly not going anywhere.
---
Part of the reason I keep coming back, the community is probably the best video game community, idk any other that rival it, minecraft maybe? Gw2 is the best
---
While unfortunate, I don't think it's technically possible for chairs to pick up colours from anywhere with the current tech. But then again, chairs are essentially stationary mounts, so... yeah.
---
(But that also explains why skyscale chairs are being offered before any of the custom skyscale skins - it just clashes less now so more people would be ready to buy one.)
---
That happened to me yesterday in sandswept Isles!!
---
what's the top red's wearing?
---
Feeding is still on a 24 hour wait IIRC.
---
I would say GW2 has a "soft" trinity so to speak. There's several forms of end game content (fractals vs raids, for example). Once you get to the higher levels/elitist groups, they'll almost always want DPS players and some sort of heal/support in the group. Tanking is really only relevant to raids, but there are different mechanics that dictate exactly who is the tank. However, that being said, it's definitely flexible, which is I think Anet's primary goal with avoiding a hard trinity. Many classes can get different sets of gear so that they can fit the different roles, and it depends a lot on what your particular group wants. Players have the flexibility to choose the playstyle they like.
---
GW2 certainly could do better with encouraging group play (story missions are all soloable, for example, there's never really a time in story where you are required to go get other players) but I think it's actually in a good spot where group stuff happens naturally, mostly in the open world.
---
The No Trinity thing is somewhat outdated. All classes can fill all roles, and all classes can do things like heal themselves at least once without needing a dedicated healer, but you still find a soft trinity in most content (you'll have DPS players and dedicated healers who can still do SOME damage). Tanks are really the only thing not seen prominently outside of a couple of encounters in raids.
---
Maybe OP is referring to how LS1/Scarlet’s story was transformed into a tiny recap that skips over all of the little details during that whole arc? 
---
As someone that missed most of LS1 and then came back during HoT years ago (only to buy LS3, PoF and LS4 a couple months ago when I started playing again), I went from seeing regulars like Logan, Caithe and Rytlock to never seeing Logan again (maybe?), trying to figure out Kasmeer and edgy girl’s place in the world and only just now noticing Taimi’s limp. 
---
Great story but I would have loved to have LS1 in game somehow! Even as some “projection” that shaves off the busy work and allows you to face the “big moments” (since LA has changed). An addition like that could lead to us playing ancient battles (though I mean, isnt that what Fractals are? oO)
---
But youre complaining cos you got your music box free from opening chests and u WANTED to pay 700g-5k (its 4.999know) to not waste time o.O
---
Iv done the run in highlands for a 2 months for nothing, its time consuming, but its easy and free. I dont know why youre complaining - IF youre entire argument is that you just want the option to sell your box, i can totally understand and anet should un-acc bind it in someway. But i read you wanted to buy it and not waste time farming it by spending an 1-2hrs each day... Seems like a weird complaint considering you have the item is all.
---
Oh, well thats surprising and good to hear. Thanks for correcting me.
---
rip
---
Man, I need a Bag sender like that. I barely have 8 slot bags. 2-3 of them and I can't open any boxes since my reagents banks are full, have to waste most of the loot :D
---
Hey bb
---
About half of my stuff got reset.  Didn't matter if it was in my bank, bags, or equipped.
---
Condibrand here.. Yea that was painful solo
---
True. I initially displayed every single core to show it off but i decided that would clutter the screen too much.
---
Since it's about displaying the general impact of settings and informing people about their options, i decided to keep it cleaner / simpler.
---
I took this philosophy about the time guild wars 2 came out because I got married and advanced my career to the point where free time is my most precious commodity. Guild wars 2 became one of the best games I've ever played because of this. I take nothing too seriously and just do whatever sounds fun for the night. Just got my beetle mount over the weekend and have a lot left to do. I don't feel bad I'm behind because guild wars 2 really doesn't care, i can do whatever I want whenever I want and still make progress.  Perfect mmo for busy folks
---
I mean, who doesn't have like 40 18 slot bags just sitting somewhere?
---
Stellar weapons were removed, not Astral. Stellar were ascended weapons so it makes sense they were removed.
---
Thanks for the continued QoL changes! :)
---
Those are white stockings. Thought that would be obvious.
---
You need the currency for the sky scale either way.
---
I normally use the wiki, but this is pretty good too as a boss-checklist:
---
http://timer.silversunshine.net/
---
Chairs *are* technically mounts. But I imagine that this in some way different from just arranging the player character and the skyscale model in a pose.
---
Its bound to left click by default ;)
---
That is how you Tea Bag in GW2, dayum we need an 18 slot Tea Bag.
---
I took a 3ish year break then picked this up right where I left off with an impossible amount of content to go through. Love the game for that
---
They posted [a picture](https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/e921fVision-Trinket.png), actually.
---
Ah, this makes a lot of sense.  I like a lot of these, I hope they aren't account bound or something.
---
also paysafecard or stuff like what privacy.com
---
I think some CC companies can also issue you different card numbers for online as well
---
Fully agree on your statement. However there's no way to clearly display 16 threads on the screen at the same time without creating a big mess. The reason i felt it was fine to go with CPU usage in general, was the visible impact on fps. Most settings that heavily impact the cpu will also display said effect in the fps.
---
I'm not saying my method is optimal, but that was my though process. If i ever do make a specific CPU based video i will probably just include them all for the sake of giving the best possible image.
---
Edit: Might be an interesting idea for a future video. Displaying all cores and just seeing how they behave in terms of usage. Display how good / bad the multicore scaling is currently
---
It's not supposed to look exactly like the one on the outfit.
---
Also on postprocessing gpu usage: as postprocessing is done for entire screen, it's effect on GPU usage are directly depend on screen resolution. 
---
With postprocessing set to high, you can switch render sampling and see that.
---
You don't need to craft Elegy armor.
---
Qualitea
---
I fed mine this morning, but cant re-feed them post patch. /CryingFace
---
Can confirm this, I got like 10 of the white mantle chests and sadly they're not stackable ;(
---
A lot are reskins and returning skins from GW1, which makes me wonder if they're raid-related.
---
random exotics or like 3 bows and a stone for example?
---
Hold on.. do both of The Desolations meta events share the same Hero's choice chest? And it's once per account per day, so doesn't that mean people are likely to only be interested in doing one of the two of them in a day rather than both?
---
The little city in the South west corner of fields of ruin was my go to. There's even a portal in did divinities reach that takes you there.
---
Joko rises.
---
Maybe there some kind of "show only 2 maximum used cores" setting, that should lift all problems.
---
It's very subtle, looks more like an infusion.
---
Unfortunately I can't last more than an hour at most when farming. My brain turns to mush when doing something as dull as pressing 1 and running around in circles.
---
Don't use CDKeys. Many of their gem cards are fraudulent and will get you banned.
---
Criminals steal credit card data from people, then use that stolen credit card to buy digital goods like gem cards, and then sell those gem cards on CDKeys for cash. When the victims of the fraud realize their card has been stolen, their bank reverses all the charges. ANet gets hit by a chargeback from the victim's bank, and bans the player that tried to use the fraudulent gem card.
---
Is there a way to disable the effects on them? I would love stat selectable gear that didn't make me look like a sparkledog.
---
I know but I have a lot of stat selectable gear that didn't reset.
---
Oh that's an interesting thing i did not even think about. I knew the post processing was scaled to your output resolution but didn't think about render sampling. That might actually be a great reason NOT to turn on supersampling in general.
---
Do you have any idea what ratio supersampling uses anyway? I've not been able to find any proper source.
---
There may be changes in-combat like with Aurora.
---
Didn't test it much, just threw in exotic weapons. Mystic forge stone makes it unreliable which end weapon type you get anyway so I don't think it matters what type.
---
The [sub-collections of the Vision collection](https://i.imgur.com/YyjU30q.png) should clickable for QoL, just like the [Skyscale collections](https://i.imgur.com/RX7eqPP.png) were.
---
I rechecked the thread and according to [one of the posters](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bu2hld/new_ectoplasmic_stone_research_thread/ep6e351/), you just toss in the new stone and three exotics for a chance at one of the new skins. Plus that person was able to sell the skins so they aren't account bound. Pretty expensive at the moment but that's going to drop as more people figure it out.
---
The initial push can be tough for some people, but once you start unlocking specializations and traits the sense of progression gets a lot better.
---
All I know (from getting the link in chat) is that it's an **accessory**.
---
Interesting idea. I was initially looking to display just core 1 through 4 or something. But oftentimes a random core will be used instead of the expected first core (to be honest i'm not quite sure how the cpu decides which core to put the load on). I'll see whether it's possible to display the current most used cores. Should be a great fix if that's in any way possible.
---
Being primarily by myself doesn't really help. But who know's perhaps farther along I'll meet some people. I did re-install the other day so who knows.
---
That’s really cool of him.
---
Nice, thank you! So it is actually the weapons that were datamined. Now we only have to find out about the recipes that seem to be specific to some weapons. I wonder if it has anything to do with the researcher in LA, maybe they unlock if we give him enough mithril?
---
Its completely wrong though... There are like 380 hero points in core maps, totally enough to max almost 2 elite spec. 
---
It would take an insane amount of time compared to just doing HoT or PoF maps hps though. 
---
No idea why these people are telling you its impossible.
---
Edit: Im not so sure anymore. Might be my memory playing tricks on me.
---
It's not just if they were or weren't equipped.  I have several 'anomalies' on my account that I can't explain.
---
For example, my ranger had sparking petrified wood with vipers stats, not equipped, that was reset.  My mule had sparking petrified wood with rampagers stats, not equipped, that was NOT reset.
---
Mesmer had two ruby bands, not equipped, both with same stat.  One reset, one didn't. 
---
There's really no rhyme or reason as far as I can tell.
---
Yeah, I feel like that should just be a button in your inventory not part of a dropdown
---
I felt the same way. I was really proud of myself when I lasted long enough to go through 2 Palawadons in one run. I am a bad farmer.
---
What they really need to add is an ascending list of percent map comp per character per zone. That would be game changing!
---
If they do an improved Zhaitan fight, I'd rather they either a) just rework Victory or Death instance (ideally with a PS rework to make it replayable), or b) make it a fractal.
---
You must have missed when they added a new one to the gem store for HoT metas. They will most likely do the same for PoF soon.
---
&gt; The chair won't update to the new skin anyway
---
In theory, it could. It's "just" a character model/rigging and some animations. It would only look a little off if any skyscale skins have models that make its body much smaller or much larger so things don't line up. And some skins might have a new set of animations, but that's unlikely.
---
Are you sure doing 100% map completion doesnt give more than 250 hps? Im pretty sure it has like 350+, remember seeing that number somewhere. 
---
Guess I could be misremembering though.
---
To add on to what other people said: Once you pick a type of material, you just get the materials sent to your mail every day. No need to gather them in your home instance.
---
Though to be fair, a nice looking set of armor and a mount alone is really impressive to new players. Especially if you have a shiny/wing backpack for some reason.
---
Oh snaps, I did miss that! Guess I'm getting that and another shared inventory slot. Hopefully they'll update it for PoF, but I don't have issues shelling out for a third portal device either.
---
Do you know the name off the top of your head?
---
I don't have any character slots open for new toons, but I'm totally down for shooting the shit/helping out if you're looking for conversation and advice. My main is Thadjarvis, if you want to add me and mail me/whisper me at any point.
---
In a perfect world? Yes, update the game to the newest possible engine and enjoy smooth 60-150 fps in big zergs.
---
However.. Realistically speaking it is very much unfeasible. Anet would have to dedicate a huge amount of time / resources to this project that would take away from other content being developed. Now i am not a game designer but with the little coding experience i do have i'm pretty confident revamping the entire engine would take months upon months of dedicated dev teams working on it.
---
The question to ask is "Is it worth the time and resources when it can also be spent elsewhere?" and unfortunately i have to say the answer seems to be no.
---
Now before people respond by saying blizzard did update world of warcraft (the common response). Blizzard is about 30 times bigger (on top of my head statistic here) and has way more disposable income than Anet will most likely ever have.
---
So while i'd very much love to see the game running smoother (there's a reason i have my high end pc), i think it's not worth it for both the development team and the playerbase.
---
Some stat selectable items didn't get reset. Everyone has a different story for which items failed to reset. For me, it was character specific, for some it was specific stat types, for some it was equipped vs inventory, for some it was invisible bags, etc.
---
I don't raid (yet! Might get into it soon!) But the amount of communication on ANet's part is so refreshing. 
---
It feels like the game at launch, when there was so much input from Devs to see the game launch well. The communication now feels like the game is getting some kind of second wind, right when the game was proposed to end for good... 
---
Brb gonna say thanks at the gem store...
---
Idea for a condi thief with shouts? Give it a warhorn and call it a Banshee!
---
Don't project.
---
not so unique any more ;) there is weaver now too.
---
I love this community! People are usually so helpful, its refreshing to play a game where other players are mostly nice.
---
People in GW2 are so nice it's kinda crazy to me. After coming back to the game after many years me and a few friends were doing a jump puzzle, a pretty damn hard one too in my opinion. This one Mesmer kept following and rezzing us and teleporting us to higher up spots throughout it even though we kept failing and falling over and over. He just wanted to help. We were there for over an hour possibly even 2 hours, few times I fell from the very end and had to start entirely over and he came down and helped me again without asking to the point I just felt really bad but he was so chill.
---
Did not get credit in '[Visions of Jahai](https://i.imgur.com/UJI8JWY.png)' for '[The Convergence of Sorrow I: Elegy](https://i.imgur.com/3YRcIZN.png)'
---
I had the [Shield of the Lion](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Shield_of_the_Lion) in Guild Wars 1, but blue dyed.
---
In general I like these skins :D
---
All the single completion ones do.  
---
The jungle ranks, the hero minis, etc
---
dropped more than 2k when the game started, no pres, im very unlucky ;)
---
confused, is this like last meta rush? no cap per meta event?
---
Seems like Arc is working just fine actually.
---
edit: Build Templates are failing to apply Diviner stats to legendary equipment.
---
No, it was pushed to its own release to have it full release on its own. Today you got pre-event in LA for it. Probably there will be stuff like that throughout whole time until release, in similar way how we found dead bodies before hall of chains.
---
I wonder how this will work with Augury Rock, in particular the doppelganger and the ghostly trio thing. Will it still just happen ~20 min after killing Essher? It probably will, but then it will overlap with other metas as well. And the doppelganger is arguably the best part of that meta.
---
There was a time when collections didn't exist and people complained they didn't know what to do in game. Collections are effectively a quest log built into a different format that can only be tracked up to X amount at a time. If you don't want to do any of this, then don't as the game isn't forcing you to do so. You make your own goals here.
---
I forgot about this site... and how annoying it is to customize.
---
I don't know, I haven't started them because the achievements are broken.
---
Sad to see some meta's excluded on this (i.e. Auric Basin, LWS4 etc.), but overall looks like another fun event. 
---
I hope the tiered reward structure feels more rewarding than the RNG boxes last time.
---
That's where they sleep and nest.
---
That's possible.  I think they just wanted to disconnect Ranger shouts from runes that benefit from shouts, for balancing sake, presumably.  That can't really be done on the rune's end:
---
" +125 Toughness; remove a condition from each affected ally after using a shout skill, **except if used by Rangers.**"

&gt; # Late Notes: May 28, 2019
---
&gt;# 05/28/2019—Late Notes
---
&gt;## Living World
---
&gt;### New Legendary Trinket: Vision
---
&gt;**Appended Note: ** The Memory Fragment cinematic within Jahai Bluffs may cause seizures for those who are photosensitive.
---
&gt;### Bug Fixes
---
&gt;- War Eternal—Descent: Fixed an issue in which Aurene would fail to appear at the start of the instance for some players.
---
&gt;- War Eternal—Descent: Fixed an issue in which some visual settings could create strobe-like effects during the final encounter, which could negatively affect photosensitive players.
---
&gt;## World Polish
---
&gt;### Dragonfall
---
&gt;- Chopper events have been appropriately flagged as group events.
---
&gt;- When players exit conversations with vendors, the achievement panel will now open to show progress.
---
&gt;- The requirement of a daily reset between skyscale collections has been replaced with a 2-hour wait.
---
&gt;- The skyscale hatchling may now be fed four times per day instead of three.
---
&gt;## General
---
&gt;- Hoelbrak: Updated the collision on several of the halls to prevent players from falling through surfaces when exploring with mounts.
---
&gt;## Items
---
&gt;- Spearmarshal&amp;#39;s Plea can no longer teleport characters below level 80 to the Griffon Sanctuary or Sun&amp;#39;s Refuge.
---
I just did both for collection's sake.
---
Me and my guildie are currently both unable to craft Extra-Pungent Skyscale Treat.
---
Because these clearly are not from the outfit. Look at the Revered version.
---
Make crap, get crappy reviews.
---
Did you speak with Amira in Sun's Refuge?
---
&gt; Some builds, particularly for engineer and elementalist, just don't have melee or ranged options.
---
Excuse me, but what? They do.
---
&gt; What do I do now?  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;YOU RIDE THAT SKYSCALE! Work on the masteries, dye it, etc.  
---
&gt;... And then you :( that there wasn't an LS4 legendary trinket.
---
He-he-he
---
m.o.x. play the sun beyond the peaks
---
Never done the meta, but seen the mechanic a number of times elsewhere (Dragonfall meta &amp; bounties).
---
My main issue with it, is that when I am in melee range and 100 people are all attacking the enemy, I have a hard time seeing the ground to see if I should be at melee or range. I also have a hard time seeing if I am doing 0 damage. I'll find that I go wham on some cooldowns only to realize after that I didn't do anything.
---
TL;DW -- Salvage lots of cheap blue gear.
---
nooooo. i wanted that tital Q\_\_Q
---
Anyone have any information if you still get rewards (or what ever happens) after donating and then logging off?
---
This probably includes all/most the armor pieces you can choose from, but it's hard to Fashion War with it because it doesn't show how pieces mesh together.  
---
Use the wardrobe tab in your bank to play with each piece individually on your own character for best results. You can preview anything you don't own too.
---
It's so freeing once you get used to it!
---
Oh, I see what you mean, thanks.
---
I still don't really like either mechanic.
---
Yeah, I'm equal parts surprised that HoT meta events were included due to how often they're run in the first place, and that Auric Basin was left out of the bunch. Perhaps there's just a limit as to how many events they can include?
---
On the other hand, Drakin Cinderspire is about to get a week straight beatdown to make up for the years of being ignored.
---
For all the ones I got, crap. Spent 8g on ingots, got about 1.5g back in junk and unidentified gear. But got AP and a title so not really that upset.
---
I didn't realize this, as some had unlocked automatically. For the Dragonfall armor unlock I had to buy an item for 5 gold at the magic vendor, too. Thank you!
---
Cool.  Thanks for the info.
---
&gt;I hope the tiered reward structure feels more rewarding than the RNG boxes last time.
---
That statement makes no sense since you can literally see the reward structure, so surely you wouldn't need to wonder?
---
Doesn't mention if you have to even participate in a meta to be eligible for the community goal.
---
Unless, I'm blind, either way I love this. Gives me a nostalgic feeling of the GW1 bonus event weekends.
---
How often does event occur?
---
this changes things
---
Yeah it didn't unlock so I read the description :P
---
As an engineer, using the grenade kit for example. Do I do more damage with the grenades if I have a 2h equipped or two 1hs? What does it base the dmg of.
---
Good luck to the both of us then :)
---
Gw2 community is the best community. But also how have you not had 18-slot bags. Bags are the first thing I get on any character. I'm a loot Horder. Haha
---
Because the Elementalist doesn't have weapon switch, he's kind of screwed for half of the event.  If he's wielding a Staff or Scepter, all of his attacks count as ranged and they get blocked when only melee works.  If he's wielding a Sword (not even sure what Dagger fits under), then his attacks count as melee and they get blocked when only ranged works.  Unlike other classes, the Elementalist can't weapon switch.  Their only option is to bring a conjured weapon that covers whatever they aren't using, but you've just had to set up your utility slots for CC for the previous phase...
---
I have both sets unlocked and all achievements and it still tells me to go craft one. WTF?
---
Having an entire Sandswept Isles map doing meta just to unlock/start a fishing event for the collection. Spending 30-60 mins waiting. Then finally get the event to spawn, you catch some fish like crazy because the bar is like insta filled after 10 seconds, you get event rewards but no collection completion. ggwp. Some of these collection requirements are not well thought trough imo.
---
How do you get one? I stand there and donated multiple times, but nothing...
---
The first iteration is still up.
---
Good catch! That's exactly what I was thinking about for the Necro summon skills. Thanks!
---
I'm noting with the Orr events it's specifically listing the temple capture events.  I'd sincerely hope that ANet isn't making the mistake **once again** of encouraging people to fail the defense events by blocking them from contributing to this bonus event.
---
Worth noting, it's account bound.  Makes it even more valuable.
---
No, because the first event hasn't ended yet (despite the bar being full)
---
Those are aileron rolls.
---
Really not much happening after the bar is filled it seems... did we get bamboozled?
---
2k gem mounts still follow the skeleton of the original mounts. Some skins might look wonky with the chair then but I'd rather have a few weird ones than no variety and customization at all.
---
I expect it'll roll over with the daily reset, giving most people a chance to get the first set of achievements, and then updating with a new crafting material so it can progress again over the next day.
---
The flavour text from NPC's around the forge seem like hints to new recipes being unlocked at the forge once enough "rocks" (the sink collection, so mithril ingots right now) are thrown into it. Could be a thing  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
*Eligible Guild Wars 2: Path of Fire™ meta-events will be updated with gameplay adjustments*
---
It's happening, guys! :O
---
when the the first event even started lol
---
you have to talk to the guy and donate on each tier. doing each tier once finishes the achievement and gives you a title and 10 bags.
---
Just want to let you know I'm looking into this.

Umm I'm curious about this armor skin that's worth 3k? What's it called?
---
I tried GW2 a year ago or so and played for a few months. I loved the game - and the community was insane, so many people were willing to help me. I wanted to grind after that to get the gold and items to pay it forward. The GW community is by far one of the nicest communities I’ve encountered.
---
Nah bro, I don't want an ugly noisy waypoint in my chill zone.
---
It is global event so I expect global rewards regardless if you participated or not.
---
And the last day global reward will be opening of raid, and if we fail it, we won't have any raid :^)
---
Yep, and fix the pathing bugs where people get stuck
---
"So soon" as in a month after episode 6 release, not since the previous raid, take it easy. It's a good way to address future complaints of "content drought". What does this even have to do with giving them money? 
---
Regardless, I stated that I don't raid, but I'm glad raiders are getting their new content next month. I'll make the best out of what relevant content to me is included in that release.
---
This's so annoying. There's literally no scenario in which I'd wanna use warclaw in pve. Every now and then I mount up without looking and get bamboozled as my griffon doesn't fly.. Wait.. It's no griffon.. *unintelligible disgruntled noises*
---
is it really recruiting friends to the game without sending 4 18-slot mithril boxes and some starting gold? 🤔
---
This. Please reset all LWS3 and LWS4 trinkets/amulets/backpieces.
---
Didn't that already happen today?
---
Trinket collections make heavy use of the Skyscale so you'll need to spend that anyway.
---
Lol I know
---
I put three Pearl Daggers and got lvl 78 Exotic Hammer :/
---
That would probably require a fairly large amount of work modifying how chairs are displayed, if it's technically feasible at all.
---
Nailed it. Never really liked the site, it seems more like a database of RP characters than actually critiquing style.
---
You don't even need much for this, it's like 10 gold lol
---
I like this event, there is so much mystery going on. Which is fitting, for a "mystic" ~~forge~~ toilet.
---
&gt; Many of the biggest rewards in the game are tied to such things. 
---
Yeah. I play WvW. I know we're the red-headed step-child in this game. Anything good comes to us last, but I don't get tired of complaining because eventually Anet realizes just how pissed off WvW players are about the lack of rewards in the game mode we prefer. 
---
We did finally get reward lines, and better drop rates, ascended gear, and now we can even make Legendary armor. 
---
I actually like the story line stuff but even getting the griffon mount was the limit of my patience. This Skyscale collection is pure bullshit, and tying another Legendary item piece to the collection is even worse.
---
I can hardly wait to see how Anet makes it worse, and I'm predicting maps that require the Skyscale mount.
---
Lunatic Acolyte Coat :)
---
Warframe is the only other I can think of!
---
Im not sure if its a bug, but i did the Vision of Landscapes - dragonfall till the end, collected all checkpoints and then.. nothing happens. no achivement at the end-rift. so i stuck with my trinket achivement .
---
 i have not tested other maps visions but i saw many players having issues at the same final spot in dragonfall.
---
Well, it's the clipping I meant.
---
I hope you find a game you can enjoy buddy
---
Are you having a stroke?
---
tHe miGhTy zOmMoRos iS AmUsEd bY yOuR oFFerInG
---
Yeah, I mean I haven’t even played GW2 in a few years now and I am still active / subbing to this subreddit because of the community and the nice updates 😊
---
looks random between junk to doubloons and i even got emperyal star...
---
Allright, thanks for the clarification.
---
why it taking so long , is it a meta that popup every 2h
---
I've still got my infusions inside of all gear that was reset. 
---
Best way is to contact support and ask them to look into it. They can see if they disappeared or not.
---
Something was wrong, it got fixed.
---
There's no point on an item that exists solely to be enjoyed if nobody will get to enjoy it unless they forfeit their normal lives for an infinitesimal chance to get it.
---
Just be happy for those who will get to enjoy them now.
---
Yes, but what I'm saying is that I had previously made 70 crystalline ingots, with the intent of trading them daily with the primeval steward. Now, it's not a valid currency and I'm stuck with about 40 of them that I had purposed for one thing and don't have anything else to use them on currently.
---
For reference, the TP’s supply of mithril ingots shot from 1.1M to 440K within 2 hours.
---
Thank you all!
---
None of the vision of landscape for the collections are working for myself or my friend, we reach the end of the volatile magic trail, but it won't let us interact with the rift
---
Isn't that base one? Remove Skyscale. After removing it is called Burnished Steel.
---
Same thing happened to me with that ring
---
When you group up with people to take turns jumping to your death so you can Rez each other for Dwayna’s Directive or whatever it’s called...that’s what I call a community! I usually play solo and have no friends and I’m a noob, but when I do interact with other people it’s always been super helpful and/or fun!
---
Really? Can you preview any pieces you dont own? How?
---
&gt; this was a sad way of clearing the Mithril economy
---
This was 100% the desired effect.
---
you just got got homie
---
The dye on my skyscale is the base one aka Burnished Steel. The chair has no actual dye counterpart as it seems to use multiple dye channels especially on wings. I want my gems back.
---
Look at the final rewards on the wiki and decide which one you want to go for.
---
my infusions on a lot of trinkets are gone
---
I have two Caladbolgs and none of them got reset
---
Is this really all the raid gets ? a throwaway line hidden in a blogpost that's not even dedicated to it ? Not surprising people are not aware there are raids in Guild Wars
---
Base damage is based off your stats - two 1-handed weapons is usually the same as one 2-handed weapon, stat-wise.
---
I think they test the community goals for the next week's Meta-Event rush.
---
They didn't work for me either
---
I did it when I was very newb, I actually freaked out a bit because I had a lot of "valuable" mats (for a noob, like silver and some monster parts) and couldn't find them at the bank or anywhere else...It took me a month to learn it was in a different bank tab entirely and understand I didn't destroy my mats !
---
Cdkeys is so cheap because cdkeys buys bulk codes when gems are low price and then cancels the cards later on. Once they do that, your account gets banned. It's uh, not good, to say the least. Do NOT buy from them. Tons of people have had their accounts banned because of that.
---
Using the in game gem store is the easiest way, and yes, you can use debit. Put your card info into the game (or maybe into your anet account on a browser?) And it will work fine. You'll just have to live with the 40~% price increase for legit sellers or risk losing your whole account.
---
Tfw I had the opposite issue. I knew it existed and I used it but I had no idea where those materials were going.
---
I reported you : &gt;
---
Translation:  
---
Arena net, can we have furry cosplay asura?
---
No, we have furry cosplay asura at home.
---
The furry cosplay asura at home: furry cosplay asura
---
Or just not buy gems 😉
---
I suspect these are related to the new mystic forge recipe
---
&gt;non-outfit fox ears
---
jesus christ how horrifying
---
Some are, like the Crystalline Wings backpack (or something close to that name) but some like Ad Infinitum are only earnable through mostly crafting or achievements.
---
I'm not surprised to see AB left off. That map is prime for MM abuse with this event. It and Istan being removed is essentially a must.
---
Que?
---
Commands for next necro's elite specialization focused on minions. FINGERS CROSSED
---
i would have atleast liked to get the item most other people got for donating.
---
So I guess the over 5000 ingots I threw were for nothing. Great.
---
Yeah, I left the map and everything suddenly concluded about a minute later. Came right back. No karma thing.
---
Nice timer it seems. Got mine yesterday. And I really took it easy to unlock. No rush. That's perfect. Let's start the journey. 
---
... Oh wait I still need to defeat Quadim -__-
---
No, it's not a possible request, unless you want a new chair with every new skin...and it will never work with dyes.
---
PS: Being sensitive and downvoting me instantly won't suddenly make you smarter, nor correct, about the situation.
---
The event states that it's global, so no point moving maps.
---
Did you get down there in the same way i did? Or is there another way?
---
I'm actually wondering for  a portion of these, if they were older concepts that just never were fleshed out and someone one day decided to update and implement them.
---
Okay but the point of the event is that it's a material sink, presumably to unlock mystic forge recipes or similar. There's a number of new weapon skins that have no names which are likely part of some tiered reward for this global endeavor. I doubt it's meant to have significant personal rewards.
---
And the skyscale, and the mastery achievement of each episode...
---
fuck man
---
It's indeed completely pointless as it is. But that said, I would never pay for a freaking chair in a game anyways, it's just insulting.
---
I don't think a new elite spec will use pre-existing Command skills, rather it's more likely a new elite spec will add Shout skills back to Ranger.  Based on how all other elite specs have worked, they all add their own new skill type.
---
It's possible, especially if they intend to add future runesets that involve shouts.  I'm not sure if Trooper or Reaper are strong enough to justify the change on their own, though.  I mean I like trooper but still...
---
I have to believe this promotes clarity for the sake of future content, rather than purely existing content, whether it's on the shouts/rangers side, the commands/other classes side, or the runes side (or a mix thereof).  It feels like overkill if it's not laying the groundwork for new content, IMO.
---
That is true. I'm afraid raiding is just not my thing, so I'd rather spend what little free time I have on the parts of the game I do enjoy. I didn't mean to imply it's completely impossible for casual players. :)
---
Qadim didn’t die, he fell into the Caudron—which he was planning to use to create new life by combining aspects of different creatures in his menagerie. 
---
I suspect it will be some kind of mutated, coagulated Qadim in wing 7.  Like, a Qadim-Voltron of different things.
---
Your agressive behaviour won't get you anywhere either.
---
Edit: I am sorry. Haven't seen your name before the conversation.
---
I spent 1 mithrill ingot and I got it. So it doesn't have sth to do with the tiers.
---
Or make the effect an infusion. I’m fine either way.
---
Hey! No need to apologize, I'm always happy to help if I can! I get exp scrolls from doing my daily quests.
---
But the scrolls I'm referring to are the instant lvl 20, 30, 40, etc. Those come from your character's birthdays.
---
I wish, it's the only thing holding me back from making Aurora
---
my berserker stat mawdrew got reset and so did a couple zerk rings. i have no clue
---
Not  topic,no answe, ty but where did y find in my ? "swap".
---
buddy i think that was the fix. Im not sure why you think otherwise? that was a message minutes before it ended.
---
maybe it reset its stats if they were selectable?
---
I don't really know how i did it. It happened only for once and it's been a while. But i guess i was trying to get to the border of the map while gliding then i've found myself at the ground.
---
I lost one somewhere too. I made 6 and did all events. Only killed one ley champion though. When I did the thunderhead keep one I didn't get the achievement. Unsure when my 6th disappeared.
---
On one hand, this sucks for people with epilepsy. So thanks for the heads up.
---
On the other hand... *lights up weed*  Yeah, I can't wait to experience this 8)
---
Yes I understood that before reading your comment but thanks anyway. (-:
---
Wow, that's lazy.
---
Hmm.. I don't like Aurora. Oh hey, a new legendary accessory! If I like it I might make it. 
---
(It is Aurora) 
---
:(
---
Gift of Battle Track grants you Clovers and some LS3 Map Tracks give you cool Skins for Armor and some of those skins you need for Aurora Legendary Trinket so the easiest way to get 'em is from WvW...
---
But otherwise yeah, just look it up on wiki.
---
Yeah i only have experience in some of the raid  fights, mostly ones where thats a thing, but thats why raod chronos were usually set up with lots of toughness
---
Nice work! Congratulations. :)
---
So you start the video with both legendaries?
---
* [Comment by ANetCameron](https://reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bu5ogy/vision_effects/ep7808h/?context=1000) - 2019-05-28 21:20:57+00:00&amp;#009;
---
It's shown in the video, it's literally the same as Aurora. Only in combination you get a new "skin".
---
Half of the servers had wrong translations (Google translator?) for over a year after release. They eventually figured it out at least.
---
He removes Aurora at 00:23 but for some reason it appears again on his character (balls are still there).
---
You saw it in the video. It IS aurora. Effect gets upgraded when you have both.
---
You have to pay in gems yes but I bought them very long time ago when 100 gems were like 3 golds. I managed to drop precursor at the very old queen karka event. And converted all of the profit in gems, hoping for a greater benefit over the years, didn't miss :)
---
Rumor is you only get collection credit if you contribute fish before the bar fills up. Which would really suck, because everyone wants to do this now.
---
I remember this event being bugged during the backpack collection, too.
---
Skyscale is not really a grind. You mostly have to travel all around Tyria and do some JPs. Aside from a few locations you have to visite twice, there is no repeat -&gt; no grind. 
---
The 250 map currencies *could* be called a grind, but each map has so many sources to get currencies, you can get your 250 currencies from each map within 2 or 3 days with barely repeating anything.
---
&gt; for some reason
---
The reason is that Vision is the same as Aurora, the only difference is the name.
---
i think its good couse another aura will make more visual noise and now with this looks like upgrade
---
In other words: both of them give the same effect, but combined they have a new effect.
---
So, it combines with aurora into this effect. Seperate is the same as aurora.
---
**Materials are:**
---
100 kralkatite ore, difluorite crystals, inscribed shards + 1 elonian wine
---
100 lumps of mistonium, branded mass, mistborn motes + 1 elonian wine
---
these two gifts combined with 100 funerary incense and a bloodstone shard
---
gift of energy + gift of the mists + 100 icy runestones + shattered gift of prescience
---
mystic tribute
---
precursor
---
Edit: you need the skyscale with rift repair mastery, so basically 350 living story mats in total.
---
Thanks for the video and congrats!
---
It's beautiful, particularly the combination of the two, but it's not for me. That saves me a lot of time thankfully.
---
.....that's it?
---
Andt hard trolled me. I thought there’d be no trinket this season so i went ahead and made exordium. F
---
It will one day sell
---
This is the best actually!
---
Does anyone know the significance of flagging the chopper events as group events vs. non-group events?
---
Curious how that system works.
---
What the...
---
Such disappointment. I wanted leg trinket which doesn't have floating balls around (playing warrior) and they gave it once again?
---
Wait, so if you equip just Vision you get the same effects as equipping just Aurora, but equipping both is what give you the new effect?
---
AB is still run so much because of Viper's gear, not just the loot.
---
Gratz Rumpo
---
Thanks for your well thought out and complete comment. In hindsight i do agree that some of my tests may not be as representative of the game as i might want them to be.
---
By doing this video i seem to have opened up more discussion than i had anticipated. My original plan was to have an up to date video for new players to reference were they to run into issues. Considering new players start in the base game, i took this as a point of reference.
---
Your points are all valid and i will take into consideration doing a revised version. For now it might be best i close this thread to prevent more harm from being done.
---
Oh thank god that I saw this comment, I was afraid of what this + Aurora would look like.
---
Thanks for sharing!
---
...and there's the downvote followed by a nonsensical comment, once again. Lol.
---
How predictable...and sad.
---
I really hope there is a "hide"-checkbox in the works for the people that like to be full legendary without the need to roleplay princess bubblegum.
---
I once left my character on auto run for a good 30min, saw on mini map he got ported back to centre a few times but he’s now at the edge of the map “under water”  
---
was able to swin around for a bit and stand on some invisible floor. pretty cool.
---
Yes. But after the first you have to craft some of the materials  so it's more expensive.
---
got it... ty :-)
---
How to take precursor?
---
Hm, that's kinda lame and clever at the same time...
---
Cool, do you have any pictures?
---
For 95% of the game it is still, yes. Exceptions are instanced endgame content in T4 fractals and raids
---
There's already [a video up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4&amp;v=BNUXTSxWxeY). It does appear to be identical to Aurora, but they stack to form a different effect. The aura is silver-white instead of blue and purple, the floating balls 'stretch' occasionally, and they leave behind trails of silver sparkles.
---
I DESERVE REWARDS FOR NOT READING
---
No. I don't think so? I thought the entire thing was you still get credit for something even if you left the map, you just don't get notified.
---
They already said that this will be not possible because, trinkets and back items behave very differently than weapons and armor in their code
---
Holy stroke, Batman!
---
That's disappointing...
---
Did they finally remove the no fly / no mountzone at the city gates?
---
Test in arena and see if it does comparable damage. No one can see which build you're running, so if it's not dealing terrible damage there's no harm in playing it. It's worse than viper for sure, but not much.
---
Time gate achi, yay... i hate that map.
---
Have we recieved info on the bugged skyscale mastery?
---
it has actually nothing to do with it, but that is what immediately came into my mind :D
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0fxuoJGdGs
---
So glad Serpents Ire is in !!! \O/
---
Yep, exactly like that for me and my guildie. The bar completes, but nothing happens.
---
Man, really? I thought Vision was only going to be the understated aura around your character, but drawing weapons brings out the lights/bubbles? Pass. If it were just the aura I would have really liked to make it.
---
They did it with the gathering tools too, so maybe transmuting trinkets could work.
---
anet dev 1: how do we get rid of all the cheap as mithril
---
anet dev 2: let the players destroy it themself!
---
anet dev 1: but how?
---
anet dev 2: let them burn thousends in an event and reward them with 15 ap and 5k karma, kappa
---
anet dev 1: ok, implemented. still better than 2 blues and 1 green!
---
anet dev 2: wait. lets implement a bug, so that it looks like the event is stuck at 100%. more burned mithril.
---
anet dev 1: way ahead of you! programmed it to get stuck for about 1h.
---
anet dev 2: great. we will just explain that 1h delay was for people to catch up! *flex*
---
-------------
---
side note: remember that 1 halloween where we burned the complete stock of t5 leather? atleast we got some nice port scrolls out of it. 5k karma cant even buy me 1 ride to the desert!
---
One of the worst meme formats I have ever seen.
---
Only shit part is stupid istan weapons. I hated them to begin with, due to time gate , and now they are needed....
---
Hey! You did a wonderful job as usual, buddy. You never let me down.
---
His alcoholism is my excuse as to why I mess up my DPS rotation. Frequently.
---
The lightning hammer is my excuse as to why I accidentally made Mjolnir instead of Foefire's Power. In my defence, they both are blue.
---
just buy the Skyscale Chair to pretend you already have your flappyboye and then cry because you can't change its color
---
Same effect as Aurora? That's kinda... lame.
---
I didn't like the moons from Aurora and got excited with the more colourful icon (hoping for something redder similar to how the new magic is redder), but if it's the same style and even gets weirdly bobblier with both equipped... I'm not as excited anymore =/
---
The only way to solve this is to
---
So that's not a bug, the base effect *is* identical to Aurora, not even of a different colour?
---
In raids or full properly grouped fractals n stuff where u can cap crit with zerkers gear, the dps is obv gonna be significantly higher than marauders, but what about in a situation without capping crit, like going solo or partying up without a ranger/bannerslave? What's the dps difference between marauders and zerkers then?
---
And you're a bunch of cells and I think you're pretty crappy. /s
---
At least you had 5k karma.
---
They don't call it the mystic toilet for nothing!
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
Good way to get people to get aurora now as well.
---
I never liked the blobs and always wanted just the aura for my mesmer. Now making the second trinket for my main will make the blobs even bigger and also psychotic :(
---
Will they expect me to know what I'm doing though? Cause I often don't :&gt;
---
Oh you got a good point there.
---
That happens to me sometimes too, I think it's because of my connection, also I got desertion in 2 matches because my game crashed, not just the game, but the computer and the connection too
---
when I got back the match was finished and it counted as ragequit or something
---
I still post there sometimes, but more as a personal archive than anything. I miss when things were more active.
---
That said, I know [SIGfigures explicitly quit](https://gw2style.com/profile.php?id=1732) because of the toxic clique-based community that was rising in it. It's a real shame because /u/SIGfigures has really great work. Unfortunately, I wasn't involved enough to know much more about that situation firsthand.
---
Beyond that, I know the "Site News" section hasn't seen an update since *December 2016*. ([Source] (https://twitter.com/GW2Style)) So the mod is effectively gone, meaning we can't really expect to see any updates to make the format more appealing.
---
Even when new members have come in and breathed a bit of life into the site, they quickly realize how dead it is and slow to a stop as well.
---
It's really disheartening because the idea of a fashion site that allows you to show off the armor pieces and dye combos in such an easily-identifiable way along with screenshots and everything is a fantastic idea. I wouldn't be surprised if the fashion community were to rally behind any new reliable site with a similar presentation format (though hopefully a more effective navigation format). Here's hoping.
---
Wait a minute isnt the ascended stellar many times harder to make than the exotic astral?
---
I was in LA for over an hour before and after we reached the goal and didn't get it because i left :(
---
 [https://gw2.ninja/timer](https://gw2.ninja/timer)
---
So then (I'm playing fa tempest so I want to get as much crit as possible) i should just sub out zerk for assassin's instead?
---
No lol. The tag is only expected to know what to do on meta events.  For random champs its just a hey everyone come here.
---
No reason to fear tagging up
---
If you have a friend in game, you can send them a mail with 5 items in it and just ask them to hit 'return to sender'
---
As long as you do not take the items out of the mail, you will have those 5 slots and then once you salvage, you can pick up the five items from the mail.  I also tend to use my Shared Inventory or my bank as well.
---
IF you have a guild with a guild hall that has the Scribing station, you can port into the hall and acess the bank from the scribing station and use your bank slots for inventory management.  And once you are done, you can hit "leave guild hall" and it will plop you right back to where you were!
---
I find it disappointing... Although copying Aurora's effect is a bit lazy at first sight, my real problem comes with the stacked effect. If you already own Aurora, paying like 1500g+ only to get a slightly more fluid animation is a bit.. lacking.
---
Don't get me wrong, the new animation looks pretty good, and it would be amazing if it was Vision's own effect and the Aurora one could be added on top.
---
Another suggestion is increasing the number of balls/moons to 6 or 7, so it really feels like you're actually wearing 2 legendary trinkets.
---
Need to make the 1 minute intro graphics
---
It cleared out like 75% of the supply of ore on the TP but the price is already starting to recover, it looks like.
---
Did that happen just now?
---
do it over until you get a buff when you start
---
Or just let us have 4 balls instead of 4
---
so it just *sometimes* works?
---
yes, with todays patch.
---
Hmm, maybe this is their "solution" to the visual noise that would have happened had they given each of the 5 legendary trinkets a unique effect. All 5 at the same time would probably be crazy distracting if they all moved around AND looked different. 
---
Having the 5 trinkets be the same effect but slightly changed in color/animation depending on how many of them you've stacked seems like a clever workaround to the above-mentioned issue. 
---
My other solution would have been to only allow one of the 5 effects to be active at a time to make sure visual noise is not a problem. But that would require ANET to implement some sort of UI addition that lets you place a "tick" on the trinket whose effect you want to prioritize and that just sounds way too complicated to implement.
---
4 18 slots bags, never had an issue even before unidentified gear.
---
I'm no expert but I think grieving is not as bad on FB as on other condi builds because most of your condi damage is burning and you can reach 100% burning duration without being full viper's. Not sure if sinister's would be better than grieving though.
---
Wait a minute chairs are coded as mounts. There has to be a way to dye them
---
I also wished for something different.
---
I hope for a skin rework on Aurora too tbh. I feel like almost every new skin is aimed at purple mesmers. I want to have Aurora and plan to get Vision eventually, but those colors just don't work really well with anything for me. Everything else has enough options (or can be reskinned) but the leg. trinkets will destroy your fashion wars if you want the convince of stat changing. 
---
It would be great if we could dye it OR disable parts of or the whole skin. If I could only disable the aura I would be immensely happy.
---
Okay good to know, thanks
---
I raid, I do fractals, I run open world, from time to time Ill dip into WvW and PvP though Im by no means actually good at either. Im not in the mood to argue but theres a need for any MMo to keep endgame players invested, and part of my annoyance isnt that Anets release cadence is glacial, its that they've utterly failed to engage any of the playerbase in raid content. The fact that Raids are only played by such a minute amount of people is a complete failure on Anet's part. Everyone should aspire to raid eventually, it should be the PvE endgame, and yet its a niche that has no way to ease into the actual content.
---
Yeah it is not good. It used to be really good though.
---
Fits my daredevil that has bifrost and glint wings aswell :D
---
The interface made it seem like you could solo the copter event, but the mobs spawn too quickly for a non-optimal build to actually solo the event.  So the interface just now has [Group Event] on the event description on the right side of the screen.  No difficulty change in actuality, just better display of information of the event.
---
same goes for named chests.
---
In fact only very few types of ascended chests do stack :(
---
Just hope it doesnt clash badly with vision/aurora colourwise
---
\*Error: Could not parse text.*
---
I need some advice for my condi berserker (for casual and solo open world stuff). All of my trinkets stats reset like they should after the patch and even without them, my condi duration is 35.86% and if I mouse over my bleed and burn duration is at 68,86%. I haven't played in a while and I don't remember how this works, if I combine those percentages it goes over 100%, now that I can select their stats again, what should I do? Metabattle recommends that I go FULL viper but why? condi berserker's main dmg comes from burn and bleeds and that's capped, isn't going for something like Sinister a better choice?
---
&gt;Am confused... So your alt's have to have the same birthday as your main in order to get multiples?
---
No.
---
by any chance do you also know the requirements for 'come to the aid of a peaceful people?'
---
You need to hava all PoF done . All Living story done. All achievements and collections done. Weapons wich are not even in collections of achievements. Astral weapons are 3 000 Kralk Ore wich I would gladly buy for more then 10 000 magic. You need to have all the mounts and Skyscale to get what exactly ? A COPY OF AURORA ?!? You got to be kidding me. All of that just to get this ? 
---
I feel like they are not even trying anymore. They will just thow everyhing together to get nothing. This is a joke ?!? Literally all of this for nothing ?!?
---
I can't go a day without getting a stack of mithril.  What gold?
---
The idea of having a combined effect when equipping Vision and Aurora is neat, and I do like the effect. But a 100% copy paste on its own just feels lazy. They could have tweaked the colors of Vision to make it more blue or more purple, change the orb appearance or swap it out for something else like swirls, etc., so it would still "match" Aurora but stand out as its own, unique skin.
---
Eh, my enthusiasm kinda took a dip after seeing that I'm essentially making the same thing I already have (combined effect aside).
---
I'd be happy enough if we could hide the effects altogether.
---
That, or being able to make legendary trinkets with no effects out of ascended trinkets after getting level 500 legendary crafting in artificer.
---
Yeah, I'm bummed I won't be able to get on until the price has mostly recovered, I'd have dumped a few of my own stacks otherwise :)
---
&gt; Literally all of this for nothing ?!?
---
**All** f**or Nothing**
---
I don't think so, I think if there were a new BLC that would have been datamined, and it hasn't even been a month since the last one.
---
Maybe Coalescence comes with the raid.
---
I sometimes make bags and send them out.
---
I'd like to see what it looks like.. &gt;_&gt;
---
No clue where it drops or what aura is, any info would be great\^
---
Tech is meant to be enhanced. So same for me, I'll buy this chair if and when it adapts my current skyscale skin and colors :)
---
What website is this? I'm a returning player from way back at initial launch and just finished the PoF story. This might help me find the money I need for the gryphon!
---
I sure as hell nope not. I switched map after waiting it refresh a few times.
---
I'm not crying! You're crying! *sob*
---
You've always had ways of converting karma into gold, though I wouldn't recommend it.
---
Yes, I'm aware of it. Again, her prophecies related to Kralkatorrik. Her legacy was to provide a means to replace the elder dragons with her own offspring and I'm sure she'd love for all her offspring to have survived to do the job. But they didn't, and she never prophecised that they would. As far as is possible, that has now been accomplished. We still have other dragons to deal with - sure, fine.
---
But glint's role in that (beyond anything she can do over in the mists) is over. She has no further offspring that we're aware of, and her prophecies have all been fulfilled so there's nothing more she can do. Her storyline is essentially over.
---
So can we assume the legendary ring will also add to the globs? Is us being consumed by a legendary slime the ultimate end goal? What else could upgraded globs look like? Maybe a more solid form?
---
Funny thing about that Hoelbrak note. I actually ended up under the map while trying to climb to the top of the Great Lodge this last weekend. 
---
Also Amalgamated Gemstones in the desert? Fuck yes! I am hyped for being able to do these metas for once. I literally have mever been able to attenpt the fight with the hounds of balthazar.
---
Hmmm... I forgot about that... Maybe. It would still likely require either some UI work or a moderate amount if work patching the two parts together.
---
Nope. Late notes have it.
---
Supposedly it comes from the end of the item gathering event at the mystic forge (currently disabled because it bugged).
---
I didn't even get the karma reward at the end.  So I can't say for certain.
---
win-win.
---
The aura system needs an overhaul. Such effects should be decoupled from actual items. Auras should be integrated into the Wardrobe system, with several Aura slots per character, and Auras that get unlocked account-wide when you consume the Aura-granting gem/infusion, like with other cosmetics.
---
There was one listed on the TP before that ended, I'm assuming it's from the bags given for donating for now.
---
thanks \^ shame people who got it didnt send a ss or vid before listing...
---
Wait seriously? I am one of only 7k people to have the skyscale?
---
&gt; you need to feed your hatchling twelve treats
---
Twelve pieces of skyscale food, not treats. Treats are a completely different achievement, there are 14 treats rather than 12, and you can dump all 14 treats down the gullet in one visit.
---
all Harrier stats picked from Assaulter Pieces seems to have that
---
It would be indeed be cool if they integrate this tech, even though syncing a sitting character with custom skins seems like a daunting task.
---
But then they can actually sell all of the mounts as "chairs", and it would be a cool thing to buy for more people than those who're fine with a unpersonalized stock model.
---
There's a FoW card of that. The fiend of dark pyre. My favorite.

I'd be for ever in your debt if you took one for the whole community and bought, and posted pics
---
&gt; snacks are still limited
---
There's food and there are treats. There are no snacks.
---
Just buy it and show reddit it for free karma
---
I’m happy, but I’m sad.
---
I guess I don’t want them to be reduced to another Dhuum throne or stack of blinding infusions.
---
And now look at dungeons. It's almost like the design of the game changed over time. I guess you can just ignore the rest of my points because I put a TLDR. Nice job throwaway account.
---
Ah damn that sucks. I wonder if that is true for a "global event" I guess it is.
---
would love to buy one but TP seems to be down atm
---
Apparently it looks bad, but the person that got it refused to show it so he/she can sell it before people realize its ugly.
---
Viper trinkets give you 20% condi duration and considering that most (if not all) condi builds use condi duration food to maximize their damage, I'm pretty sure that you'll be fine in full viper.
---
It's likely something that didn't quite make it into the game, or was around during the beta, and is useless now. Like those rare low level weapons (sword, axe, etc) that are on the TP for thousands.
---
Gw2efficiency
---
Your charr is showing.
---
Also this doesn’t include any solo piece like specialization rewards and lw rewards. So these are your full sets there are a bunch more to mix and max.
---
Human underboob chest and the winter scarf, too?
---
Now you :D that THERE IS A NEW TRINKET YAAAAAAAS VISIONNNNN
---
FYI - That is not Vision showing in that picture. Vision's effects are the exact same as Aurora.
---
2nd accessory wish [granted](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Vision).
---
1st ring wish [granted](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Key_of_Ahdashim).
---
How are you doing this? Ask for more stuff, quick!
---
Ehh... no. 
---
If you want Viper's gear, you do AB only 2-3 times to get the recipes for insignia and inscription. Then you craft/get other armor and change stats via mystic toilet. 
---
But people do VB daily. Viper's gear is definitely not the reason.
---
Hmm.. then maybe I'll get one after all. Now if only they'd bring back the baby griffon glider, which is what I really want.
---
It came out with the latest patch.
---
Shit really? And here I thought there would never be a chair I'd buy.
---
I don't raid, so i don't really care what Coalescence looks like. Just copying the effects from Aurora, though... it feels wrong.
---
Does the mystic infusion which you can see on trading post have been found to have any connection to this event?
---
Weird that this is the effect, but I really like the combined effects. 
---
Could be bugged since the picture ANet posted with the Don't forget to select your attribute article is literally called [Vision-Trinket.png](https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/e921fVision-Trinket.png). Maybe this is the mystic infusion instead?
---
5k karma
---
I don't really run with meta groups much though, a lot of just running around with some friends who don't really play that meta or are that good in general, so it's not really a secondary set. Damage obviously gonna be bad compared to a meta group, so I kinda wanna make it as good as I can (barring obscene costs). Also, I already run arcane, as I find that the 2% damage per boon can pretty much make up the difference with fire, and then having the extra utility that it provides is worth it.
---
It works now, lets go! JUST DO IT! ;)
---
Someone report Gorrik, too.
---
I’m a lvl 500 leatherworker and could easily make a saddle.  But this guy says only he can do it and he needs a bunch of dangerous, magic, radioactive ores??  He’s conning me and I demand justice.
---
Sounds convenient.
---
How many did you have to throw in?
---
The Dungeons are, technically, part of the grander story that introduces players to Destiny's Edge, who even now are still fairly major players in their own right (well, two of them). While they're not the focus of the story, it's still good to get some idea of them before they just show up in Arah like you're friends.
---
Yeah, I meant food.
---
I've never seen such a horrible patch ever. I spent one and a half year grinding my music boxes got 3 because of them being unobtainable in any other way. Then all the suddenly Anet decided to up the drop rate and make em tradable. I am so done whit this shit game and Anet ruining game mode after game mode. Now they even ruin the real rewards in pve. It's time to move on let's all play wow classic in august.
---
You've had like [2150 days](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=days+from+july+9+2013) to acquire 22 Charged Quartz. If you didn't bother making them, that's on you. It'd have been enough to make one every three months or so and you'd have more than what you need for the Skyscale.
---
I haven't seen anyone ever complain about the other daily crafted materials, so I really don't understand why people are throwing a fit about this one. It doesn't even require you to level up any crafting disciplines!  
---
The only annoying part is that they can't be taken from the material storage, but other than that it's as easy as pressing a button or two and waiting a few seconds.
---
I don't think Kralkatorrik's Torment should be beaten so easily, nor' should difficulty be dragged down.
---
A casual player is capable of the same things a hardcore player can do. They just have less available time.
---
I'm more upset that rose quartz is expensive af now, and I'm starting with none.
---
Do it.
---
I'm guessing there are private servers out there? Or did they bring it back up?
---
That's pretty awesome. I've always felt that the player base is really nice overall. I've only just returned after a couple year absence and I still see people helping each other and politely answering questions, etc. So many other MMOs players shut people down for not knowing what's going on. It's a great game and I wish my friends would get into it.
---
&gt; Isnt that also changed to 2 hours wait instead of daily reset wait?
---
That change refers to starting a new achievement. When you complete an achievement by going back to Gorrik and then you have to wait for an email from him before starting the next achievement. Previously, you had to wait until the next daily server reset. That's been changed so you only have to wait until "the next day" in-game. The day/night cycle is 2 hours.
---
Lol it really did do the whole 'you just crash landed here and aren't welcome here'. vibe of a hostile jungle really well in retrospect. But at the time it was like why is this game so hard.
---
wait what. I literally agreed the game has been getting dumbed down for the worse and this entire thing started because some guy said he didn't have time to raid and you insisted that he was wrong for some reason.
---
Could be bugged? ANet posted a picture called Vision-Trinket.png on one of the new articles on the site. https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/e921fVision-Trinket.png
---
Could've been a mistake though, and this could be the mystic infusion effect.
---
Thanks for the answer!
---
But that's the thing, I'm already at 100% for both bleeding and burning wasn't that the cap? Why isn't going sinister for more condi damage the best option?
---
VM nodes became dark red after redoing a couple of times; collected every node sequentially, still nothing. Redid the course 4x :/ probably just wait for a bugfix if its a bug.
---
In that case it doesn't even matter what you use as long as you're having fun with friends. Players die anyway, and so do bosses. Minmaxing in such groups is pointless.
---
They just updated that today
---
This combined effect actually looks uglier than just having one trinket, I think Im just gonna stick with my season 3 trinket. Poor effort on this Anet.
---
yep sadly &gt;&lt;" time to afk alot for meteors to mine, cause screw buying the dust at its current price.
---
I have a guild per game mode I play (fractals/WvW/open world PVE) along with a large social guild, so can chat to others.  Guildies are always friendlier than map chat and help each other out when they can.
---
Large guild does a lot of open world events so easy to come and go.
---
Guild hall has harvesting nodes for some easy materials.
---
Suggest you play the game modes you like, and keep an eye out for common guild names, then ask if you can join.
---
Oh hey I saw you in the sanctuary! Gathered a crowd quite fast!
---
How does it look together with Aurora?
---
Wow, so [much free bank slots](https://imgur.com/Hbul15Y) I got now. 
---
(But seriously, good change.)
---
&gt;Removed the daily purchase limit from Funerary Incense purchased with Elegy Mosaics.
---
not anymore.
---
I have these items but I'm too scared to use it. Can confirm it's a recipe.
---
https://i.imgur.com/g7qr43g.png
---
([symbol recipe for comparison](https://i.imgur.com/BQnmjAb.png): gives a random superior sigil)
---
It's cool that stacked they create a new effect altogether but themselves alone they are both the same effect which is disappointing.
---
Even so I would have preferred a unique aura different to aurora's but I guess some people will enjoy this. Waitingfornexttrinketgang
---
This would make more sense to me.  Super rare drop from a repeatable achievement reward.
---
Do it !
---
The way it was designed, yes - the legendary trinkets share a base effect when equipped on their own, and upgrade to the new effect when you have both.
---
Gz on the Legendary Lava Lamp
---
And what about the base 35.86% condi duration? Or is the 68% I see already taking the 35% into account?
---
Have been removed actually! If you’re willing to spend a little gold, the shortest time to get the skyscale now is 2 resets. Feed before, feed after, feed after.
---
Gift of Upgrades
---
He's being sarcastic
---
The latter one.
---
nothing happens wont let you forge it
---
Why do i have to change the URL to [https://i.imgur.com/ivReER0.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ivReER0.jpg) to actually get the image displayed? :(
---
I'm really excited for this. My guild used to run Orr Temples a ton back in core gw2 and early HoT, but it fell apart eventually. Having a valid reason to run them again is exciting a lot of us who used to run consistently
---
There's a recipe that uses 10 motes and 1 of each of those symbols to make the Superior Rune of Infiltration, and similarly using the other symbols makes the Superior Sigil of Peril. 
---
Seems like a bug? I don't know of any MF recipes that both use the exact same materials just in different numbers.
---
Visions of Dragonfall ask for heavy corsair chest instead of boots. All other Vision collections reference the armor pieces that were given for mastery achievements.
---
Sadly not . Maybe a bug ? I have no clue
---
So I guess the legendary trinkets set will just be this effect getting more and more complex with each additional trinket?
---
Thank you for the statement.
---
However, I hope the dev team takes into consideration the community feedback regarding this shared base effect, expressed in multiple posts both in this thread and [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bu6a4q/request_please_make_vision_at_least_a_recolour_of/).
---
For real, I've been playing for nearly 5 years now and I had no idea who Drakin is.  But now that I know him...I hate him.
---
Cheaper waypoint cost lel
---
aight let's go:
---
-  new expansion
---
- new raids
---
- update dungeons
---
- rework sirens reef
---
- swiss tournaments
---
- wvw alliances
---
@Anet tnx
---
There are also mastery and hero point trains on the weekends. People will get raids together and hit up all of the hero points, waypoints, masteries.
---
or just get it cuz its 1 step closer to a full legendary character
---
Gotta admit that disappoints me.
---
I've always enjoyed a more defensive style of approach to games.
---
Basically I prefer to not die.  My reflexes aren't very good and my internet is a little bit on the slow side to make matters worse.
---
I also end up playing alone a lot because nobody I know plays games like GW2. 
---
Any recommendations on Classes/weapons in regard to that?
---
I like it personally. Grabbing it once I'm done with skyscale
---
This is how my guild leader nabbed my asura 3 years ago. I still have that 18slot leather bag after 37 new characters.
---
while i am a raider and understand what you mean, its not completly true.  
---
gw2 is just some themepark mmo for most, they dive into it to enjoy stuff and chill while they do not need to think or put some heavy work into.  
---
just like some people go fishing and pop a beer or throw a frisbee or whatever there is where you actually do not have to be competive at all. and there are plenty of such activitys where you do not have to get better because its just chill.  
---
if you look at the content which arena net releases for the most part, its exactly what they want for most of their players and how they think the game has to be played.  
---
sad, but nothing you can do. i wouldn't be suprised if this was the last wing we ever saw...i hope this won't be true, but i wouldn't be suprised either.
---
As soon as I discovered that functionality, I started spamming it as much as I could.
---
and currently, mesmer clones get the combined effect with only aurora
---
Oh boy this didn't age well
---
I like that it’s not super visual bloat but I’m a bit disappointed with it since it’s not entirely new
---
ok its hours later still nothing hmmmm
---
7000 registered GW2efficency accounts.  So more likely to be about 14000 actual players if not more.
---
I'd argue that swapping for 4 seconds to do repeated berserker mace things the loss would be still better than core warrior.
---
I agree. Being that glint/aurene use blue as a theme, and the combined effect is more blue than Aurora, and with the raid wing taking forever, it would make sense if Vision gave us blue balls

Eh, you're probably right. Shame they abandon or barely work on every fucking system they have except shit tier story though.
---
Absolutely. But the sad fact is that most new players ignore those stories and only follow green starbursts. Which is why I say that there's never REALLY a time in story where you need more players (hell, the story paths can even be solo'd though that wasn't my point).
---
"Completing those events will also contribute to a tiered community goal: each time the participants reach a goal, they will receive rewards for that tier, and a new tier will unlock. Keep an eye on the event tracker in game to see how close you are to the next tier."
---
It says participants will receive rewards if they reach a goal
---
Path of Exile's community is nice too.
---
27 chests may be the reason I think
---
Uhh... More than half of my stuff has not been updated to allow me to select my stats. Just to name a few: spellbreaker helm, Eclipse (and the other two), Inquest Apparatus backpiece, the Elegy set (was this stat sellectable?) , My Transmuted Lava Skull Backpack, Tempest's Warhorn, my transmuted Reaper's Greatsword, Caladbolg Rosa
---
Plus I'm getting the error: The game client is unable to gain access to log-in server at this time.
---
Additionally, can't access gem store.
---
It's the reason that the ANet DBadmins hate the lack of time limit for sell/buy contracts
---
&gt; like the ghostly appearance from Omnomberry ghosts.
---
Oh, I'd do a ton for that effect.
---
Nope. Not there.
---
the anthology of heroes with t6 mats are probably to change stats of mystic infusion...that makes me more curious for the recipe with globs^^
---
Or not because you can now get any-stat ascended trinket with simple LS currency farm, instead of going through the whole ordeal and paying the premium price of a legendary.
---
The chest and leggings don't have particle effects (the rest of the set does). The "scales" glow but their intensity can be muted with the right dyes.
---
Hammer Guardian. It's not Meta, but even with an full offensive layout, the weapon provides a lot of protection.
---
18, to buy the 6 items you need for the 6 subcollections (3 ingots per item).
---
Was this just one time event? Cause I never camp in LA so I missed it :( I'd love to burn my mithril for a title! :D
---
leaked legendary runes and sigil recipes?
---
nope, tried running the maw today and east was still bugged out
---
Also me:
---
[gw009.jpg](https://postimg.cc/v44KPncB)
---
Tailoring, Leatherworking, and Armorer player crafters can make them too (in with descriptions appropriate to the craft.) There are a zillion of them at the Auction House, priced very reasonably, as making a bunch of bags is often done while leveling crafting skill.
---
This is honestly really cool, would be awesome if they kept the "progression" with the two rings, giving you the fully evolved effect once all 4 are complete
---
I dunno about other folks, but when I saw that Vision was tied to Aurene, I was **really** hoping it would utilize the crystal aura effect from Prized Possessions when drawn.
---
The fact it's identical to Aurora is boring, even if they change the effect when stacked.
---
I never crafted Aurora, despite having all the achievements done and that unique gift fully made. I didn't because I don't like the effect. I was hoping Vision would be different, or at the very least we can hide the effects.
---
I'm a bit worried Coalescence will end up being the same thing as Aurora and Vision, with a bonus effect change if you have all three....
---
Unless it gets updated, I'll probably only finish the group events for the Vision achievements, and work on finishing Stellar, Heroic Dragonsblood, and other things before returning to finish Vision.
---
I just brush them off at this point. Or banter at them and salt them up.
---
thanks! seems weird we still dont have a megathread for the collection yet
---
Not all heroes wear capes
---
TTS used to do it once a week. I did it several times, as recent as a few months ago.
---
I just finished my first legendary last night. I think I lucked out on that one.
---
Definitely thinking that
---
This was my reaction too. I love the idea that combining them gives a new effect. But alone they’re both the same? Such a disappointment.
---
Yeah he can do that too...just doesn’t usually. Too bad they haven’t fixed this since I’ve reporter it probably 30 or more times since PoF release

Is this legit? Not just somewhere in your inventory? Typed in the search bar and everything?  Not stacked with other +9s you might have in inventory? 
---
I’ll be hella pissed if any of my infusions are missing
---
Only 500k? Those are rookie numbers boy
---
Ahh I expected the draw effect to be something like the aurene ascension effect but its the same flying balls with the "cells attempting cytokinesis" effect when combined &gt;.&gt;. A colour change wont make much difference for me since Im a necro main and this effect (and most legendary auras) does not hv that 'spot on' aura for a dark-themed character :(
---
I agree in principle, but I fail to see how the test environment would miss how it would work on the live servers. The failure of the rewards to trigger is one thing, but I think the bigger issue is 5K karma for such a huge amount of resources is... not good? Like, anyone with a brain would tell you that this isn't a good idea. Hell, if ANet wanted to do this, why not just add a vendor who converts Mithril to karma at some fixed rate? Lore justification being that we're donating building materials to Elona.

If it's anywhere remotely evening-ish NA timeframe on Friday or Saturday I'm at work. I can play earlier in the day most days of the week (up to 3pm Mountain time) but that's never when anyone organizes anything. Even on weekends things get planned later, around reset time (3 hours later).
---
jokes on you,i found out about this *event* from reedit and i missed it completly. rip my 5k karma
---
Yeah, the last part of the event badly needs a rework, the invulnerability uptime on the boss is way too high. It needs more than just a slight reduction on the bosses' health.
---
OMG YES
---
Yours is always the one I recommend!  Love it's minimalist aesthetic.
---
Confirmed. Happened to a bunch of us. And this is an **old** bug too. wow
---
Still have Almorra and Dwayna's directive buffs despite. Oh well.
---
Well I sure as hell didn't attune and infuse rings and not slot agony infusions in there... And yeah I searched my bank and inventory.
---
This, I really don't like the effects of the legendary trinkets and not being able to toggle it off means I won't waste time working towards it since I know I won't use it because of how it looks...
---
While we're at it how's about fixing the animation so the balls orbit smoothly without stopping for half a second after each animation cycle
---
atleast make the ball colorable
---
Tempted to get both for the bubble effect, but most of the reason I'd go for the trinket rather than a weapon is because the trinket is half the cost... looks incredibly meh without both though.
---
With both, love the bubble effect. Weird that they share the *same* graphic so if you only wanted one accessory the choice doesn't matter.
---
The roadmap we got a while back mentioned legendary runes and sigils. I'm betting this is part of that, which isn't meant to be visible to us yet.
---
Mr. Miller is homeless no longer!
---
Low key hope he becomes the next hobotron.
---
Uhhhh that sawed off shotgun pistol, yes please.
---
New legendary trinket good thing ive been saving my gold.
