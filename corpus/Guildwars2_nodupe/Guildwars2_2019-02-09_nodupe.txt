Well yeah.  You don't think Stephen King gloats about how he scares his readers?
---
---
---
And once someone will check and post the result here... Pandora's open.
---
That happened to me so many times when I first did the personal story. The final instance was hard enough without having to do it 10 times due to random DCs.
---
Can't decide on a class, huh? There is so much to choose from, I know...

For any story chapter, only those who have unlocked the content in their account will get rewards from intances. 
---
For season 3 and 4 you won't even be able to enter the map without owning the episode.
---
I'd recommend getting the episodes one or two at a time for the both of you. Take your time playing the story, completing the map, and getting the achievements, then get the next 1-2 chapters.
---
They are only 200gems per episode, so if you get the chapters instead doing something else like going to the movies once a month, you'd be able to get 2-4 episodes per month each.
---
Yeah but captain marvel and end game tho 😂
---
i wouldve loved if theyd omitted that canach line about aurene being 'the grandaughter of an elder dragon afterall'... its so fucking stupid considering what sylvari are; what he knows sylvari are
---
You may want to give the parts of this that apply to you a skim: https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guide:How_to_Gear_a_Character
---
Depends entirely on what is it about playing any MMO, not just GW2 specifically, that makes it enjoyable/worthwhile to you. 
---
This may have been why it didn't affect me emotionally all that much. They tried to make Aurene more likeable but because she can't communicate it fell flat for me.
---
Do you not enjoy playing the actual game? I'm serious. Are you only driven by the loot, and not the gameplay?
---
You need to do it twice for Aurora.
---
Yeah these streamer reaction videos (in general, not just the specific ones featured here) are of professional performers entertaining their Twitch viewers with a performance. Even emotional people don't look like that when they go through emotional moments in games - because most of us aren't entertainers giving an audience what they want to see. Somewhere along the line creators took the bait and started pretending these reaction videos are genuine and not performances for more viewers, maybe because they want to believe this is how audiences react to their stories.
---
People never behave the same when they know they are being filmed, especially when they get more viewers/money for being more animated and responsive to their audience. Content creators like to believe these are genuine responses to their work because doing so convinces them their story content is convincingly hitting the intended emotions.
---
its in the Black Lion Market (Gem Shop)
---
So I've played mmos my whole life, before this I played BDO for 2 years. I really really enjoy the combat, community and graphics but I think when I completely bypassed the gold making and gear acquiring process it cut out a huge part of the game mentally for me. Because with gear progression comes dungeons, raids, fractals etc. So in my head there's no point in me doing any of the above because I have "all I need"..Im just in a weird mental limbo.
---
Pretend loot doesn't exist. Do you stop playing the game if there's no loot? If yes, then it's time to take a break.
---
On the other hand, if you want to enjoy the gameplay, then start setting challenges for yourself. Try and improve your DPS. Clear events faster. Solo champs and bounties. Participate in more competitive or high-end game modes (PvP, WvW, Raids). Don't aim for loot or rewards. Aim for achievements and self-improvement.
---
Or if you don't want that either, try to do something relaxing. Sometimes I just turn on TacO routes and follow one for open world gathering or map completion.
---
Lol, I used a guide and it went pretty quick.
---
Hoping to stop someone from buy an expac they can't use? Good will? Trying to help? IDK, maybe I'm not a cynical dick?
---
Totally Gimli.
---
The Desolation borders Orr by land? Huh, TIL. 
---
Well never blue but...people put weird things up their ass. I can never unsee it...
---
I wish i could give you one.  I have at least 5 of them.
---
Luck gives you more account magic find, opening the envelopes gives you a decent amount of luck which gives you more account magic find. You also get a minor amount (0-24%) from achievements which is added into your account total. If you got everything (including silverwastes) but no boosters, you'd hit 460% with your magic find. With boosters that's 760% which would be close enough. Drop research from last year and this year were saying that around 600+ is when you started getting more than the money you spent (last year) but this year they look to be giving more and at ~900% were dropping 1.4g worth of junk along with all the other items. If you were to sell your envelopes right now for 1.4g you'd only be making ~20s after fees and at that point I still think it's worth it to try and open them for the extra loot.
---
200 gems is about 66 gold. That is a lot, but yet it isn't. You can make 20/hour easily running meta events. More if you know what you're doing, or have high magic find , etc.
---
It's Urist!
---
It says I can't watch it because it's not there?
---
What gear/outfit are you using btw? o:
---
You created this problem yourself, lol.  Those sorts of goals are meant to take several months worth of playing... 
---
I feel like it's just common sense to not chip in and give purchasing advice based on how things *used* to be, especially with such misguided authority. Sure, mention how it used to be if that's correct to the best of your knowledge, but at least have the sense to say 'It used to be like this, but it could have changed'. Like, I haven't played Runescape since 2007; I'm not gonna go on that subreddit and answer someone's question about buying membership based on how I remember it being back then, because there's a good chance my information is out of date. 
---
They were announced over a year ago and it appears the changes won't occur until at least near the end of this year because anet hasn't devoted any extra resources to it. This delay has meant the bleeding of players hasn't stopped.
---
You used to be able to troll bosses with it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hG9w_cdoR8o
---
thats the only real reaction right there
---
There are plenty of prophetic characters in GW1, I remember being pointed out. Someone with more thorough lore knowledge could probably list them. So it's never meant to be implied that Kralk-related entities are the only ones who can see the future.
---
From a storytelling perspective, the thing is that so much has been retconned and added about our understanding of Glint (and related entities) that it's hard to know exactly what's what in regards to prophecy.
---
Do they see *the* future or possible futures? Can they tell the difference between those? Why was Glint so confident in her own visions that she decided to write them down?
---
Before this knew information came to light, I proposed the idea that the reason Glint was such a potent seer was because she A) could live well beyond the lifespan of any human,  and B) explicitly knew about the Elder Dragons. But now that we know it runs in the family, I don't really know what to make of it.
---
Plus, the Dream itself is still oddly mysterious, seeming to originate with Mordremoth but be able to exist without him? Maybe? And it connects the memories of existing sylvari to be passed down to unborn sylvari, but also provides glimpses of the future?
---
I really don't know, to be honest. It's a tricky subject.
---
I've been stranded at 49/50 for ages. Nothin but boring grindy titles left.
---
To me, what really destroy my heart in this Scene is hearing Taimi crying her eyes out...
---
&gt;The fact that nearly everything can be traded in GW1 saved me a lot of grief.
---
That's how I got Closer To The Stars... was stuck at 28 points a few months before GW2 came out and one of my friends who used to farm the Realm of Torment for "fun" just flat out gifted me a couple Torment weapons for my Hall of Monuments. 
---
Fallout 76 got released last year, for $50 USD. GW1's a highly polished game, and 14 years on it's STILL getting QoL updates.
---
I just did the story mission where the Pale Tree guided me through Orr, so it's fresh in my head.
---
She said that the future can change in an instant.
---
Its more likely that prophecy is more of a probabilistic analysis than a certain thing.
---
Then again, I'm pretty sure when the commander was killed, the wraith that we talked with mentioned a bunch of other commanders in parallel planes, or hinted at this possibility. So fate may exist. But its possible that fate may not be discernible to an entity observing within the system. Fate =/= Prophecy.
---
Consider: a component of a system, if it wants to be certain of what the rest of the system will be doing from now until forever, has to observe the entirety of the system (including itself). In order to observe the system, it will need a way to gather and process that data. Since it exists within the system, it can only rearrange parts of the system to meet its observation and information processing needs. If the goal is absolute certitude, the system will never be able to meet those needs.
---
So instead you use heuristics to analyze what data you can gather, and those predictions are "close enough." That would be prophecy.
---
Seriously, the semantics between 'game', 'standalone campaign', and 'expansion' are pretty much meaningless. You can 'buy in' to GW1 with either Prophecies, Factions or Nightfall - EotN is the only one that requires one of the former. Each campaign has version exclusives, a unique story of roughly equal length, along with the 'core' content (mostly skills which appear in all 3 campaigns and the PvP content, plus the Core realms of the Gods, Underworld and Fissure of Woe.) 
---
If I might use an analogy, the GW1 campaigns and their interactions is sort of like if Pokemon R/B/Y, G/S/C and R/S/E could interconnect with each other, and you could travel between the three regions at will. Each builds off the former game, but is a game in their own right. (GameFreak, pls call me)
---
You can see all the F2P restrictions [here on the wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Account#Free_accounts), specifically: "gems to gold exchange available, gold to gems exchange unavailable". That means you can't get any gems without buying them for real money. 
---
To remove the restrictions you need to buy one or both expansions. You can find them for up to 50% off fairly often ([38% right now](https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-heart-of-thorns-path-of-fire-us-43911)). Once you are no longer F2P you can convert gold to gems and purchase things like the [living story seasons](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Living_World_Season_3_Complete_Pack).
---
I found it.  I also had a very nice mesmer escort me up so it was actually pretty easy.
---
Like I said, not a fan of Aurora until they let you turn off the stupid balls, so will probably never revisit it.
---
Yess. More important character deaths! Keeps things fresh. 
---
Now u need to learn to play as u are most likey terrible and have no idea how to build eCT make every class and start reading wiki is ur friend
---
Oh wow, that really takes me back. Link your hall, it'd be fun to see it! Here's [**mine**](https://hom.guildwars2.com/us/#page=main&amp;details=oJIAAMhPAQBIAAAAggDAAEAAEAQAAAAAfMEQQAAAAAA)**.** Looks like my gift was actually one Tormented and one Oppressor item, hard to believe it's been 7 years already...
---
They started doing it in the last living story episode for season 3, which was great because everyone kept getting disconnected lol.
---
They really need to go over some 1-80 stuff and polish it up.
---
A challenge. Raids will give you a challenge
---
Juicy
---
That bundle didn't include EotN. Even if it did though, this bundle will end up being cheaper for anyone who wants to play GW1 in 2019, when you take into account the price of the flux capacitors, temporal crystals, dark matter and a DeLorean to go back to 2008 and take advantage of that ~$5 discount.
---
It's amazing how self satisfied and brilliant they think their writing is...….
---
Hey mate, if you're a lore nerd (like me), you're going to get a lot more mileage out of the game than the average player. You've got 50+ missions, a bunch of dungeons in EotN, ~7 Elite Missions/Zones (Underworld and Fissure of Woe are Core, Tomb of the Primeval Kings and Sorrow's Furnace is Prophecies, The Deep and Urgoz Warren in Factions, Domain of Anguish in Nightfall), and WAY too many quests for me to give you a decent ballpark figure. Plus, there are several zones which are entirely optional for the average 'beat the story and move on' player, far off the beaten track. I'll log in just to explore; no quests, no missions, just heading to a part of the map I haven't seen before. You'd be surprised at how much of GW1 is at least attempted to be translated into GW2.
---
Yeah, the sheer variety of ways you can go about it is such a strong appeal for it. No matter what, you walk away feeling accomplished, but your path can be wildly different than someone else's.
---
Mad props to whoever designed it.
---
Nah, someone was a fan of Dragon Age Origins and made a statue of a paragon.
---
The avatar does not hand out wyld hunts, she’s only the dreams caretaker. Wyld hints are “received” from the dream, but as far as we know the avatar does not have that much power over the dream to so strongly influence the Sylvari. Though she did protect the dream of dreams from Mordremoth, thanks to our aid in the Sylvari tutorial
---
She’s not a scion or minion of Mordremoth, Ventari somehow cleansed the seed of the tree from Mordremoth’s influence and corruption, otherwise the pale tree would just be another blighting tree. And the avatae obviously doesn’t need Mordremoth to keep living, she was already recovering when we reforged Caladbolg 
---
The dream “hints at the future”, but that’s not a prophecy. The dream just takes the collective knowledge of past and present Sylvari to understand what is happening and from that guess what can happen. It then tries to alter the outcome by giving out wyld hunts to preserve itself, to neutralise threats, or simply to expand its knowledge of the world
---
Anyway, the dream can’t prophesy the future, it’s just collective knowledge from Ventari and all Sylvari
---
Ouch. Well, I have some silver zcoins saved up for the Fissure of Woe scroll! So keep me posted, I've needed a reason to go explore there. I just figured I'd be wasting the scroll if I went alone.
---
Fallout 76 was released at $50USD and that was like 10% of a game. GW1's 14 years old, sure, but because the complete edition is the 3 stand-alone campaigns and an expansion, this bundle has WAY more content than most modern games. It has actually aged quite well; very smooth, awesome graphics (particularly with the recent High Definition patch from the GW1 skeleton crew), and a really in-depth skill system that allows for some amazing buildcraft.
---
Zhaitan’s corpse, you used to be able to boundary break the final story instance and get to the bottom of Arah where he falls.
---
ikr, should have worded it more as an "if" than a "when".
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
one can dream of a brighter future, even if it's through a pipe.
---
Its one of unrealised anets dreams and wishes.
---
&gt;I'd say new maps
---
Even with dev support I don't think we'll see a new map after how horrendous Desert's launch was. Which is 'unfair' in a myriad of ways, but a likely reality.
---
To small groups getting ran over by large: The major goal of Desert was to stretch the map and make travel time too long for a single group to train around, that against one large force, smaller groups could work on multiple objectives and literally pull the larger force apart unless it wanted to constantly lose stuff to the group it couldn't get to. However with the added thickness of Desert's walls vs Alpine making it easier to place pretty BS siege, invuln tact, EWP, disablers, dragon banner, and gens, the opposite happened. Whether or not the map could serve it's intended goal will likely never be known, because stalling on defense is so mind-numbingly easy and ridiculously effective, with EWP allowing for reliable fast movement, that big groups can get around even \*easier\* than before. So in our post-HoT world, big groups are just more effective than ever, and will likely continue to be as such until the game dies unless some huge and sweeping changes take place to unexpectable proportions.
---
I want a warrior elite spec where the function keys work like an engineer and ele but each one is a different weapon, so you can have access to multiple weapons at once like a real weapon master
---
I can't wait for her to stay dead just to spite you people
---
o_O  holy cow ..
---
As a gw2 noob gw1 vet, I cant wait for chaos gloves back in rotation so I can recreate my Assassin character
---
What are the lyrics to this? I can only understand probably half of them.
---
cringe compilation
---
Welp, good thing opinions exist huh?  Don't think I'd enjoy yours.  I'd never play any game.  
---
Amazing, once again. You got me hyped a few weeks ago with the WIP8 (I think) and here we go again.
---
If you decide to buy an expansion. Buy gw2:hot from dlgamer. I found it the cheapest there and it is an official retailer.
---
Torr, Seiran, Tybalt...
---
Look at that hammer, though.. What savings!
---
Oooh, I didn't know that. Thanks!
---
I wish it is just a big log and call it yggdrasil branch or smthng. Just a casual tree as weapon.
---
&gt;The WvW features they delivered with HoT were accompanied by a mountain of bugs and absolutely horrible WvW changes. The backlash wasn't solely about the map (which was unplayable during the Oasis event and clearly untested at HoT launch) but wide-ranging \_awful\_ fuckups.
---
I've heard tales of lag from high-tier players of that time, but as I wasn't on one of those servers, I didn't experience that particular issue. I don't recall the other bugs, but let's be honest, any large content update is likely to have them. That's why WvW players spend most Fridays after Living Story updates logging back into WvW after "server crashes" and various other PvE-only updates are fixed.
---
I agree, Anet are losing customers because of this. I finally convinced an old guild member to come back to the game after 3 years. She is pretty computer savvy and suffered from the same problems. End result was that she couldn't finish off where she'd left off from last time, Victory or Death and her personal story in HoT went down the drain, as she had to skip ! skip ! skip ! as much as possible in order to get through personal instances ASAP for fear of disconnecting again. Now she has not logged in for more than a month and has probably has quit the game again :(
---
Usable in Fractals/Dungeons but only if they're out of combat (generally you cant summon a novelty while in combat). Thats because the Bouquet is in the same set of bovelties as the Executioner's Axe which is a good mobility item for slow people in those types of content.
---
Naturally raids are unaffected as pretty much everyone is pulled into combat when the encounter starts so you cant troll mid fight and with almost every raider having a DPS meter pre-using the item and sitting in your ass not doing your job is a dead giveaway as even healer roles are still dealing damage. Hard to fake your 20k+ dps when you only have your utility skills to try to troll mid raid.
---
You're luv of propper spelling has made me loose my mind in shane.
---
Hehe thats a high quality shit post. Such wasted potential :(
---
Guilty as charged. 55% winrate on weaver vs 68% on mirage. Easy choice.
---
In my defense, I'm just doing it to get some tomes to jump start my alt account
---
Your comparing arguably one of the biggest failures in the last year to an average game from 15 years ago.
---
No 15 year old game is selling for that price, It's absurd.
---
Gw1 is dated, graphically and mechanically. If someone wants to play an RPG there is plenty of better options out there for cheaper. Divinity original sin 2 for example.
---
Oh, sorry. ..it wasn't me? Look, there! Behind you!  *flees the scene*
---
F2P? You literally have to pay €40.
---
Wouldnt it be interesting if she really is dead and he is "released" comes back and we yet again have to make another deal with him to fight the Elder Dragon? History sometimes repeats itself. 
---
Not really. IIRC only 1 group needs to kill the Aspect at the converged area, which ideally is you and your 7 heroes.
---
I've got a better idea- let us desecrate The Great Lodge in Hoelbrak as a mini questline and steal Fang of the Serpant hanging there and we just wave it around infront of all the salty Norns. 
---
If they removed it, I'd wonder why? But, as it stands...
---
Nah, I took ArenaNet's middle finger (the trebuchet), as a sign, for the "playstyle" they wanted to enforce, and would not bother farming there again as a result. That "Farm" may as well not exist, to put it another way, and DOES NOT exist in any sort of "daily rotation" that I would wish to spend my limited time on. :)
---
I don't see things changing anytime soon, just a IMO :)
---
Work on aurora. Takes forever and isn't p2w. 
---
Pvp wings as well
---
It just kind of felt like they were rubbing it in. Like, "Hey, check out how our writing surprised people! Expectations denied! Very pro writers are we. You're not the only one who was blown away by our totally not doing what you expected! It's a very common occurrence because of how cool we are."
---
I mostly just wanted to punch them in the face, which isn't really the kind of reaction that's easy to express on a stream.
---
I get that some people think it's great that they can catch us off guard like that, but I think it's important to stop occasionally and ask not whether they *can* do it, but whether they *should* do it. We just spent years hatching, protecting, and raising that character, and now they're killing it while gloating about it.
---
I don't think it's a permanent death, given how she recently ate the magic of an undead lich. But that doesn't make it okay to flaunt it like this. It's like saying, "I'm sorry, your dog ran out in front of my car. I couldn't stop in time." Then a few months later, shouting, "JUST KIDDING! Your dog is fine, I was just hiding it because I wanted you to feel strong emotions and not think that you could just have fun and win all the time!"
---
Yeah, a nice punch in the face. That feels right. 
---
I don't know what would be fun in Queensdale but I've done that on other maps and I was surprised to find that you swim up beneath enemies and fight them through the floor. I had some fun helping out the Meta in Tangled Depths that way. Keep in mind that they also got back, though.
---
Your mind has been ruined by korean mmo where grind is the whole game now when you come to gw2 where everything can be maxed fairly easily you are having trouble getting yourself to play the game as you think you have already completed the game.
---
What you can do is try doing challenging content like raids/fractals and try to clear them all first. You can also try pvp/wvw simultaneously.
---
That shit took forever and was boring. I prefer the parts post gleam
---
Nope, cost analysis just factors in the cost _to_ forge. Since this was mainly meant to be a look at the probability between the two and the drop rates of alternate items are near-identical in every [chart](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mystic_Clover/Drop_rate) I've seen, I decided not to bother with that. 
---
The only time that would come into play would be when one version finishes before the other (likely 10's), due to the cost of a forge of 10 it's highly unlikely to recoup the cost of not ending at the same time. The only exception would be getting the 1% mystic coin jackpot, in which case you'd end up very much in the positive. 
---
I _could_ add in a more accurate cost analysis that uses the drop rates of those items to calculate cost/forge etc but that may be better off in it's own spreadsheet.
---
So I'm in the process of leveling a norn ranger to 80. What are some good builds to use Before and after 80 and what should I invest in along the way? 
---
&gt;Plus, the Dream itself is still oddly mysterious, seeming to originate with Mordremoth but be able to exist without him?
---
It's never really suggested that Mordremoth is the originator of the Dream. Especially since both the Dream and Nightmare creates Wyld/Dark Hunts to fight the Elder Dragons, including Mordremoth as a sylvari PC reveals during The World Summit to Trahearne.
---
Furthermore, not all mordrem/sylvari are connected to the Dream, as we know via Malyck, while in HoT promotions it was stated indirectly that the Dream is what prevents sylvari from being corrupted.
---
Then we have the White Stag, an animal that is connected to the Dream in the same manner as the Pale Tree.
---
It seems more that, like the Pale Tree, Mordremoth, and the White Stag all have the same level of connection, but Mordremoth's domain of mind allowed him easier manipulation through the mindscape that is the Dream.
---
i mean the game is f2p buds &lt;3 they gotta make money somewhere
---
&gt; I don't think most of us are particularly expressive when we play games.
---
This is probably the truest statement for how my "reaction" or play through's go. lol
---
Image is all blurry when you zoom in to read it 
---
That’s just a preview image generated by google sheets. If you click on the link in the post it’ll take you to the actual table!
---
Damn, you're right. So the Dream is a totally different plane of the Mists that we haven't even begun to properly research, I guess? This is why sylvari need story focus again someday. There's still so much to discover!
---
🌚 helpful Op is helpful
---
A number of the reactions were pretty good. I don't think I am ever that expressive, plus it was spoiled for me so I already knew the end. (kind of like titanic)
---
❤️
---
My reaction: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWqMDBi6TcY
---
Good to know, I didn't play much GW1, it just seems everyone is making a huge deal about Kralk seeing the future.
---
Ogden was a monk...so big nope.
---
it only does a set amount of damage, split between everyone who gets hit by the shark.
---
So 1 person takes the full damage, 2 people takes half damage each, etc.
---
So you actually want to stack whenever the shark comes to reduce damage per person
---
If you have the timing down, you can dodge it.  But the damage is divided evenly between everyone in the circle.  So it's much easier if your whole party just stacks every time someone gets it and everyone takes about 15% damage.
---
Inquest Grenadier \#397, Son of Svanir \#45329, the pirate with the cannon we slaughter over and over and over again...
---
Well it's definitely new information. And when you start playing with the idea of seeing the future (and all the ways media portays it), it's easy for speculation to go wild. I mean, what happens when you pit two seers against each other? Whose future is the true one? Or are they both true, just different perspectives on the same thing?
---
Like Mike Z said in the recent interview, when you have seemingly conflicting prophecies, it negates the likelihood that players will feel that everything has been spelled out ahead of them. I think this means they gave us only enough details to have a prophecy, but there will be many twists and challenges along the way.
---
While I'm not sure about the "doppelganger as decoy" idea, the entire instance had a vibe that ascension is the topic, even before Glint says it herself before separating you from Aurene with the portals. 
---
You just don't drop a line like "There are things about the ascension only dragons can understand" (paraphrased, I'm too lazy to look up the actual quote) for nothing.
---
Funny you should mention Friday nights. They changed WvW reset to Saturday at the HoT launch too.
---
Other bugs included towers upgrading to T3 walls in 15 minutes. Guild hall upgrades for WvW required items they had removed from the game. Getting the WvW guild vendor required Badges of Tribute, which were only available from the vendor.
---
And the Oasis event lagged out the entire map, it was completely unplayable.
---
Now this is a meme I can relate to.
---
Howl, Gavin, Apatia, Hekja, Kekt, Zott, Tegwen, Havroun Grechen, Theo Ashford.  
---
  
---
Killing off developed characters is part of gw2's core dna
---
The daily Mirage crying. Lovely.
---
Yes Mirage may be extremely strong in gold and lower (due to people attacking with 20 confusion) but not even remotely strong in mid plat and higher. It's almost a meme to hate on Mesmer in general at this point simply because people refuse to actually learn how to counter them and LOS. 
---
Instead of crying about a noobstomping spec we should talk about the actual unbalanced things; the (unblockable) powerburst of Rev, Deadeye oneshots out of stealth and the unbelievable sustain of Soulbeast aswell as the synergy of FB+Scourge on mid. Because, let's be honest, how often do you see a Mirage destroying someone in an AT compared to a SB sustaining against 2+ man and still making it out alive or even downing them?
---
My memories of the specific visions she had  is fuzzy because, I'll be real, my investment in the story is incredibly limited and I pay little attention to it.
---
The visions were varied, right? Well, there were a million and one ways that insane plan could have gone horribly wrong. A different future for each potential way to fail.
---
OP here, thanks for the tips, I didn't find anything interesting, just swam beneath some waypoints and ported out. And yes the glitch happened while mounting, guess this is just a PoF kinda thing. Kinda surprised it didn't happen to me earlier.

Congrats! It's a really huge accomplishment, especially these days when obtaining the resources and achievements necessary for HoM points is not as easy as when the game was more populated.
---
It's personally my favourite title, I display it about 95% of the time (5% othrr being a new shity title, until the novelty wears off) 
---
Alliances arrive 2 years later, while slowly 2 to 3 years of players gradually leaving WvW/the game.
---
hmm, don't see this person offering anything of the sort, only that they apparently have dev mates. Misleading title
---
0/10

Relevant username? :\^)
---
With a name like "admin-eat-my-shit6" I guess I can't expect more.
---
Not only that, it punishes you for pressing skills, it punishes you for moving or dodging, it punishes you for wanting to cast a skill while blinded, more than enough stealth and detargetting, oh, and dont forget that beyond just the insane condi/raw damage burst, they can also disengage/engage at will. It goes beyond frustrating....
---
Recently tried out Mirage after maining mesmer and chrono for years.
---
This is 100% true holy shit it's so easy now.
---
I'll have to check out Caledon again. You're talking about the area near the Nightmare Court right?
---
Another way to get into the centaur area, all you had to do was use the Springer where the wheelbarrow was and smash it. It seems like they fixed it recently however.
---
I tried that and unfortunately it both dropped the performance and didn't change the appearance of the text.
---
"it actually wasnt aurene, it was her evil twin who died!"

soap opera level story here
---
That's some great evidence you got there! 
---
if you use tarrktun instead of merchant, then there's only the TP NPC so no duplicates to get in the way.  
---
but, yes, super annoying that each one is interfaced differently
---
You can get a few if you mine it from the sprocket generator, you can buy one I think with laurels or just use someone's home instance who has that one. 
---
Also a small chance when killing mobs from aetherblade in fractal and dungeon ta lvl 80.
---
I hadn't seen that concept art before.  It looks like the corpse might have been a small cave.  Wish we could have seen it!
---
Urge to kill Rising!
---
Maybe I'm in the minority but I liked the farm before people started using engineers there. I didn't mind the run up to the top, killing as I went. The trebs make that far more annoying and it's just not fun anymore, which is a shame. 
---
For me, the engineer farm ended up destroying what before that was an enjoyable activity that I could do periodically. I didn't do it was an engineer and I wouldn't do it now.

What’s your monitor’s native resolution? Do you have DPI scaling enabled? Which OS are you using?

Just don't attack back 4Head.

Dope. Can we see a screen of OC for reference?
---
I appreciate statistics posts, and don't mean to undermine any of this, but it's basically just the Law of Large Numbers in action: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers
---
I.e. more trials means you converge closer to the expected result.
---
**Law of large numbers**
---
In probability theory, the law of large numbers (LLN) is a theorem that describes the result of performing the same experiment a large number of times.  According to the law, the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value, and will tend to become closer as more trials are performed.
---
The LLN is important because it guarantees stable long-term results for the averages of some random events. For example, while a casino may lose money in a single spin of the roulette wheel, its earnings will tend towards a predictable percentage over a large number of spins.

Good bot... I'll have an Americano, please.

Omg I love this!!! Thank you!!!

I'm not 100% sure but I think that large lake on those maps is meant to be the Crystal Sea, which is now the Crystal Desert and the Desolation. From what I understand, it was once an inland sea which had the land raised when the human gods left Tyria in 0AE. The water that was there emptied into the ocean and what was left behind was the Crystal Desert in the north and the Desolation in the south. 
---
The map that /u/that_shaman made is based on a texture found on the Threat Assessment Board in the Chantry of Secrets. While it's in the game, it and the map in the Durmand Priory are the only official map artwork that I can find anywhere that includes what I assume is the Crystal Sea. Every piece of official artwork from both GW1 and GW2 does not include that massive lake; they just have the Elon River with the Crystal Desert and Desolation to the north and south respectively. Examples include: [GW1 pre-EotN map](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/File:Tyria_unexplored_map.jpg), [GW1 post-EotN map](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/File:Tyria_clean_map_2.jpg), [GW2 CE box map](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91w4BX5otCL._AC_SL1500_.jpg) etc. 
---
I'm thinking it's either an in-game reference to how cut off Elona has been from Kryta and how the Orders only have access to some very old cartography gear left to them from their gods pre-Exodus, or that it's a detail that was missed by the developers when the new maps were made. 
---
The mesmer class.
---
Fucking up the GW franchise for almost a decade.
---
Transformations can cause that to happen
---
That happened to me few times in Malchor's Leap as well and recently in Thunderhead P.
---
Btw, what's the distro and how GW2 behaves under it?
---
Nah if there are a million players, you're bound not to be the only one. But most of the people I talked to were pretty impressed...really sad or really angry.
---
People hate this specific build on mirage because it's extremely overloaded and cancerous to play against, while requiring 0 skill at all
---
There's one more episode in Season 4. Then we go straight to season 5.
---
You know that Soulbeast is cheesy too. Definitely not the ridiculous level of Mirage but pretty close to it.
---
It DID happen while I was showing off a really great gliding effect to a guildmate while I was using an ooze tonic. Even more reason to always have one now. :D
---
FRENZY MENDING WILL NEVER DIE
---
Ah ok gotcha. Definitely curious to see what happens next
---
Playin Mesmer since Beta. Stopped aroukdnthe end of LWS1. Came back recently. 
---
Seems I should do some PvP while this said OP thing lasts. 
---
Can someone explain how it works?
---
Such a wasted opportunity never implemented in the final game..
---
I may not remember well. Don't take it that bad. Or even dishonest as you say. And I didn't blame the people who were in anyway. The only to be blame is anet and only anet. Even the alliances is kinda too late for many people who already quit. 
---
Seriously, I don't understand how soulbeast is overlooked. I never play ranger, tried it out in unranked and it's so brainless I could 1v1 and even 1v2 pretty much right away. It's easier to play than mirage imo and I've mained mesmer forever. 
---
But that would mean the minion doppleganger “branded” Caithe as well. 
---
Ned Stark... oh wait I'm confusing
---
Yes it did.
---
Make sure youre maintaining as close to 100% regeneration uptime as possible. Regeneration is the highest source of healing on druid, thats why harriers is so important.
---
Hey all, come out on Monday 11 February with all of your Divine Lucky Envelopes and let's get some loot!
---
\-Laser
---
or May. With season 4 they are consistently delayed so don't get your expectations too high.
---
Agree, even on SB playing vs other SB is frustrating. All because the reworked Wildernes Survival traitline buffs boonbuilds to another level...
---
We never know, it's always a mystery!
---
How about throwing the roses at open world bots  C :
---
I do them to save on Tomes. So most of my toons have story forever stuck at Orr parts heh. 
---
what if aurene actually got branded and killed while ascending, and in the next episode we get the evil double.
---
They seemed like perfectly normal people to me.
---
Raids will give you fun. I reckon a big part of raiders play raids because it's fun. It's a weird question to ask what some content will give you to want to play the game. Isn't games played because they're fun?

Yesterday I played against 3 mirages and 2 scourges in a game, today I am still having epileptic seizures amd nightmares. 
---
And here I am still playing chrono in pvp. Seems like I‘m doing something wrong. 
---
I have never had issue finding people to do world bosses, hot metas, events etc. Maybe you should actually go into the world and not wait someone make LFG for events in auric basin?
---
Not really, as this version isn't an official song but just a cover I made, and I just hired Asja as the lead singer. Same goes with the lyrics of the full version "once again, give us your strength and fly" is just a liberty I took (because I'm still in the "deny" part of my grief ahah) 
---
Elementalist isn't dead, shit meme. As if one of the top-tier power DPS right now was 'dead' when frequently used in fractals and several raids. 
---
It's funny how Anet completely redesigned Mesmer for GW2 because it was not fun to play against in GW1, and over the years they made it even less fun to play against in GW2. 
---
In GW1 at least mesmer was one of the hardest things to play, in GW2 it's absolutely braindead now. The specs that take skill are no longer rewarding.
---
\&gt;Instead of crying about a noobstomping spec we should talk about the actual unbalanced things
---
\&gt;Deadeye oneshots out of stealth
---
swap deadeye and mirage around and your post is accurate
---
You can totally do WoC with all or mostly heros.. some spots are challenging and probably want consets but it's definitely doablr
---
Same!
---
I literally meant the streamers were all over the cringe scale, from all good to cringe af. But maybe I am getting old and don't see the appeal of fake streamers.
---
I always roll 10's i do this part first so that the extra T6 mats can be used in the other parts of crafting or to sell for more mats I need. I usually come out with more than I need. Plus I dont have the patience for rolling 1's. lol
---
trading post is getting way laggier the further on we get
---
but don't worry the actual gem store is fine
---
gotta love anet /s
---
It can be soloed but you do need to be able to solo at least a couple of hard zones (depending on which titles you want to go for). It might be possible to avoid any of those, but you would likely need to near legendary ascalon title and all the grindy ones.
---
I have 49/50 and my only non PvP ones left are challenge areas like UW,urgoz, etc. Only exception is luxon faction but I'm a long ways off from having enough since I never farmed it.
---
I had the same happen to me before with my elementalist Charr, but first time seeing a clone having different clothes from your real character!
---
^(F)
---
Imagine selling something more valuable...
---
I always figured they had to redesign it because so much of GW2 is a solo game and the mesmer, being a shutdown/supportive class just doesn't work in such a setting. The problem was, that the mesmer, being a shutdown/support class does not work if it also has tons of damage. We saw that in GW1 and we see that in GW2: either the class need to be severely limited in its damage potential, or the game is simply better off without it.
---
But hey, pink butterflies, clones and stealth!!!11!1!1!1!1!!1!1!!1
---
Wood Potatoes Potato?
---
2016 mesmer's Ether Clone used to be a projectile attack and if you reflected it back you would be the one who gets the clone.
---
So for example as a warrior you could get a clone that way :D
---
It is nice and all but it also means you cant relog if you failed some achievements, which is infuriating.
---
I think he left because his target was dead 
---
holosmith is literally just another kit
---
If you just want tokens and have griffon and portal/rewinder device, there is much faster way https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ObPEZmSsV0Q
---
You get the same rewards you'd get for doing a non-daily (or an already completed daily) fractal. Some relics, some encryptions, etc. It's easier and faster to farm these in other levels, but there's nothing to stop you from doing it on the CMs.
---
are you using this? it helped me a lot.
---
https://immortius.net.au/wardrobe-unlock-analyser/
---
Ehh? Reworked Wilderness Survival? The traitline has remained mostly the same for years, and has been a staple ranger trait line in PvP for just as long. The same goes for Nature Magic.
---
And repeatedly micro-stun you and put your skills on GCD constantly + all that and even more without even really trying that hard.
---
Then you probably don’t understand what makes it strong in relation to core ranger. And you probably won’t care if they just simply nerf what is currently the ranger’s band aid to it’s damage and pet management/pet usefulness.
---
Not that 1v2 in unranked says jack shit to begin with.
---
even got new layout for are convenience.
---
If he could finish us off he would stay. We are a threat too. Probably he was weakened. 
---
but you need a base game; it's therefore an expansion. A really good expansion, but an expansion nonetheless.
---
I love staff ele, I rarely play anything else, but only pve. Against some friends I played some matches in the guild hall and sometimes I tried wvw but I always got stomped in duels after using my CC skills.
---
Do you have a guide, a video or just some tips to get started? I'd really like to try it out.
---
WvW seems like a running simulator most of the times, mayne allow mounts on ur teritory so there is more action?
---
Step 1: be mirage
---
Step 2: shit out clones
---
Step 3: dodge
---
Step 4: blow up clones
---
Step 5: return to step 2
---
99 fractal with challenge mode active, sometimes drop 50-200~ shards. 
---
How do you deal with something that has stealth, invuls, blocks for days, hard to track and deals massive damage?
---
You don't. You turn into a ball on the floor and pray it goes away.
---
P.S. They aren't that better in wvw roaming either.
---
To cite blizzard, "do you guys not have phones?"
---
&gt; I don't think it's a permanent death, given how she recently ate the magic of an undead lich. But that doesn't make it okay to flaunt it like this. 
---
It would arguably make it worse, a lot worse.
---
we never left the trials but everything was a vision of the most likely future, so the next map will remain the sam but the story will be different
---
What a mess
---
i like how i posted basically the same comment and got upvoted for it
---
Using the site that was just linked, I have 511 items of less than 2g that I can buy. That's 511 items that I would need to type in the names for when searching on the TP if I was using my phone as opposed to copy and paste with the web site or, as I suggested, a simple check box to only show the ones that I haven't unlocked yet.
---
Ah yes, E-surge nukes along with Mind Wrack spam (or Panic/CoP spam in PvE) were definitely signs of brilliant design!
---
The class worked as long as it was built around shutdown. But since GW1 moved away from that, and since GW2 is beyond removed from that, the class is a pink nuker now. In both GW and GW2.
---
Is Assassin's Presence really all that valuable for condi DPS though? And while Renegade does have higher healing is it practical for a fight like Largos? What with the tablet needing to be very close, and Mirages tending to move around a lot. 
---
Mesemer **is** meant to be frustrating to play against. Confounding and confusing opponents is the entire point of the class.
---
While it's a nice concept vs non-human enemies it's complete and utter bullshit in any PvP scenario. Unfortunately Mesmer is also Anet's golden child so will remain OP and forced into relevance until Guild Wars as a series eventually ends.
---
I play mesmer in PvE and even I feel called out. 
---
Well, that was partially the point I was making. It is balanced around an AI, and the ranger's own weapons has lower coefficients because of having an AI, etc. etc.
---
I'm not gonna say removing it entirely was the only option they had, but they sure are deep in it now anyway.
---
Top kek worthy truly.
---
Sad thing is this is nothing new, as others have pointed out. I do genuinely enjoy the PvP or at least the idea of it but ever since elite specs things seemingly got to difficult to keep scaled for ANet, I do believe they are trying, perhaps even to hard to try and make the elite specs feel more valuable in PvP as well as PvE.
---
It's a shame really, I don't think it's nessecerly a too little too late situation though but that certainly won't last forever and frankly that was over for many within the first month let alone six years (not that I believe the state of PvP balance has always been quite as bad as since Hot)

---
Some backstory,
---
3 months ago my accounts was suspended for failure to respond during my visit to the halloween labyrinth, i saw my characters being teleported and moved them away from their new location, but did not pay attention to any messages sent to any of my characters. A few minutes later my accounts were banned.
---
A few weeks ago my accounts wree unbanned and i continued my multiboxing, this time more aware of my surroundings my chat. I invested in a second monitor and i changed the way how i play.
---
Recently Anet updated their policies so i made sure to follow them throughly so i wouldnt get in trouble again, not much changed other then no multiboxing allowed in player vs player enviroments. It makes sense, i was a little sad i couldnt multibox in wvw beacuse sometimes i would scout my server and command on the main account, but fine, if its not allowed i wont do it, and i havent since i got access to my accounts again.
---
Today i was doing my daily run of metas like i normally would, tangled depths -&gt; auric basin - &gt; branded shatterer, i went to the nuhoch lane like i normally would and waited for the meta to start. I lined my characters up like i normally would and waited. Randomly my characters were being teleported to some nearby cave, a cave which i had not explored on my characters before. I know this is something GMs do to see if people are responsive so i type "bruhb" in my chat as they were teleported to show i was responsive, i ask in say chat and map chat for the GM to whisper me. With no success.
---
I finish the meta and begin to write my ticket to support asking whats up, I miss the timer for auric basin so i join a done map instead (normally i always do the meta) after finishing clearing the chests i decide to do the pvp dailies, there is a arena i usually do it in, its called Tekkit's Arena, owned by a guildie of mine, who multiboxes himself and does dailies in there himself. I finish the dailies and log my characters standing in silverwastes, i start my boss and my accounts are suspended.
---
Not for macros, or botting, but for multiboxing in an player vs player enviroment, the thing is multiboxing is allowed in custom arenas http://prntscr.com/mirdlz
---
For what it's worth, any time I see someone flaunting a Plat badge out in the open world it is more likely than not a Mesmer. It's gotten to the point now where if I see a badge I could confidently bet hundreds of dollars that it's a Mesmer without breaking a sweat. I'm not a betting man.
---
They really nailed the tragic end here, seing Aurene dead in that position makes you really deeply sad and weak. Hope she's going to be back :( And well done Anet!
---
I am delighted that you got Asja to sing this! Can't wait for the full version, really well done so far. 
---
After my first suspension i started recording my metas, and other things. Beacuse anet have terated my pootly before so i wanted to have proof of me playing. 
---
this is the recording of me doing dailies in the arena https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ME1JVV8js0&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
as you can see the arena is owned by rozbuska, and the arena is called Tekkit's Arena, Tekkit is a gw2 partner and multiboxes himself.
---
Looks like you were multiboxing during the TD meta event. That is not allowed as far as I know.
---
I don't agree with the way some people multi box for rewards, but then again anet explicitly allowed for this so I don't see a reason to get banned for it.
---
Power Leak was divine: that was energy denial at its best. But as I mentioned, then came the mesmer rework and it was Mind Wreck and E-Surge spam. Where was the skill in that? Throw MW on a target, cover it, spam mesmer skills to edeny them. It was a chaos ele. And it's been a decade since the mesmer went from something that was skilful and amazing to play to something that was much simpler and it hasn't been anywhere near that in GW2 ever.
---
Not sure its worth coming back when this suspension runs out, dont get me wrong i love the game but the way they have treated me I'm not sure i wanna continue playing.
---
When you have lead GM's justify suspensions to stay on beacuse of "offensive names" names which had already been greenlit as okay by their own support you know they are incompetent.
---
This same GM was the one who suspended me last time, even if i was aware of the teleportation of my characters and moved them right away.
---
The Malyck plot is still being worked on by Matthew Medina who apparently had a rather compelling idea for how it would play out although there's no idea when/if it might return to the story as the idea is apparently extensive (which suggests it'd require a living world episode treatment of development).
---
As Peter Fries stated, the problem with Malyck is that only sylvari players who specifically chose a specific branch out of three sylvari stories would've experienced Malyck, so his history and importance would have to be summarized to other sylvari and non-sylvari player characters in game first, which according to Fries presents its own set of problems that the narrative team need to figure out due to limited word count budget per episode etc.
---
Then there's Angel McCoy's comment about Malyck's story supposedly contradicting some parts of later sylvari lore that they need to figure out, possibly referring to Malyck not being connected to the Dream (although there could be many possibilities to explore this as I don't necessarily see any of it contradictory, especially if there are multiple sub-Dreams).
---
I feel that one of the potential ways to write Malyck back into the story is the future storyline shifting from just dragon battles and Aurene to hunting down other needed replacements for the remaining Elder Dragons to keep the Antikytheria cosmic mechanism for Tyria stable enough. Based on what we currently see in game, we need at least four replacements although there's a possibility of having all six dragons replaced (if we can figure out how to extract Zhaitan and Mordremoth's magic from beings who hold control over it at the moment), or even dividing their spheres between twelve individuals. One such candidate could be Malyck's Tree (others being Pale Tree, and good dragons like Albax, Kuunavang and Shiny), thus making us seek her out while also allowing a continuation of the Nightmare Court storyline as we'd no doubt interact with the splinter factions and maybe ally with the less evil splinter faction led by Duchess Chrysanthea.
---
Personally ANet has comedy gold waiting to be mined with interactions between Canach and Malyck. We have a sarcastic antihero jokester meeting a more serious and contemplative antihero, and I could imagine how Malyck would view Canach's constant quips. Then add to that the tension between Malyck (and his people) and Chrysanthea's sympathetic Nightmare Court faction as Malyck just wanted to exterminate all Nightmare Court in the past, the reasons for Malyck's Tree not being a Blighting Tree (likely having to do with the origin of those seeds Ronan found in the cave and why they were placed there), as well as what the Dream and Nightmare are and why Malyck isn't part of our Grove's Dream, so the plot practically writes itself and allows for a smooth continuation of the sylvari storyline while tying it to the bigger "balance of magic" narrative GW2 is currently pursuing with the Legacy plan. :)
---
they ban bots all the time, the bots just don't come to reddit to complain about it.
---
It would be an interesting idea if absorbing more magic leads a being to have more and more accurate visions of the future. If the Pale Tree ever replaced Mordremoth as an Elder Dragon in the All and got that juicy boost of magic, her deep connection to the Dream might then allow her even more accurate visions of the future than Aurene is currently capable of if this theory is pursued further. :)
---
œuf 
---
Thanks!
---
Man I'm glad I don't have to GM a game like this
---
Yes it is allowed, its not allowed to just afk and reap rewards, but i make sure to actively do the mechanics and hit the boss. I have recordings of todays meta and others and nothing i did would be less helpful then a solo player. 
---
Its so obvious the GM continued to monitor me after this meta just to find somethign to justify suspending me, its clear i did nothign wrong during the meta. The thing is multiboxing in custom arenas is allowed, and the arena i was in is owned a guildie who multiboxes himself, and he is also a gw2 partner.
---
Anet opened up pandora's box with their multibox policies and several game discounts and free giveaways in the past and they don't know what to do now. I mean, it's just obscene how much gold i make during Lunar New Year with 10 accounts with minimal effort. And that doesn't even involve multiboxing.
---
l2p
---
Things that are 100% confirm: Season 5 and WvW Alliances. That's it.
---
The only thing we definitely know is wvw alliances. 
---
Someone mentioned that the next (and last?) raidwing is already done or nearly done, but thats not confirmed.
---
In terms of balancing, Irenios post on the forums reads like its gonna be more changes in the future towards more dps/boon support builds offering boons... but who knows.
---
Next living story will start soon, which nearly certainly includes a new mount (god I hope not) and "expansion level content" - whatever that is.
---
Thats what I know of. You can always check on the english gw2 wiki for upcoming changes. Thats where rumors are getting put.
---
Are there any upcoming sales? I've returned the game after a year now, and I have HoT. I haven't finished that yet, so might  wait for buying PoF
---
They are constantly working on bug fixes, new story, new fractals, new raids and WvW alliances.
---
Next story is probably due in late April, and will probably come with a new raid.
---
I'm not sure wether to be mad about my accounts being suspended or the fact Anets GM's are so incompetent. They tell their players to read their goddamn policies and their GM's have not even read them.
---
Well, this sucks. I guess you already sent all your proofs to the support? 
---
This kind of thing only happens because Anet's multiboxing policy is an unnecessarily nuanced mess: you can do it there but not here and if you do it there you have to do it in this way and we reserve the right to teleport you around just to make sure. It doesn't surprise me in the least that people can get falsely banned.

Honestly I loved Vanquishing for my Savior of Luxon, and Kurzick titles. There's a lot of gold that comes with completing a map; not to mention the drops, and chests for Lucky/Unlucky, Treasure Hunter, and Font of Wisdom titles. Speaking of Treasure Hunter, Easters soon. Friendly reminder that each egg you pick up counts as one Treasure Hunter pip. I wouldn't have gotten my Treasure Hunter title without Easter. Raptor farming for Eggs was a favorite pass time of mine. ^_^

100% legit, they updated the tos, and told everyone, that multiboxing in wvw and pvp isnt alowed.  so, better read tos before using 3rd party programs :)

&gt;Guild Wars lore makes it clear Glint had various eggs in her lair that you could steal

&gt;Aurene is called the second Scion in Heart of Thorns , while bards kept calling Vlast with another name: Gleam, the first scion.
---
&gt;He was kept hidden in a Forgotten City by the Exalted and the Brotherhood of Dragon, he broke free a few years before the current events while Elona was out of reach of Tyria because of the Dragonbrand and Kralkatorrik (see the huge wall near Ebonhawke).

You could reach it only via airship, a luxury that you could afford being the Pact commander.

Im not arguing because you posted no proof to argue with. Im correcting your patronizing post where you state your assumptions as fact.

cool, thanks for that.
---
Im not really impressed with neither map nor instance design for episode 5. They are shallow and pretty generic. The only reason some people consider this episode exceptional is the emotional writing at the end. I am looking at an episode as a whole, not just silly story. In those terma, kourna map was a disaster, but final joko instance gave me more fun gameplay than hitting pinata giraffe called kralkatorrik.
---
Grapevine says that production of new raids might actually stop, with next wing being the last one released. Dunno how true that is.
---
No problem. Lets hope my teachings will guide you through dangers of the internet
---
Meh, core Guardian laughs at mesmers
---
Can you give an estimation/comparison of what you'd need to do in GW2 so that it's comparable in effort/time-investment to GWAMM?
---
Woaw i never though of that theory of grenth being the son of malchor and dwayna , its pretty cool that various mortals can ascend to godhood like kormir and grenth maybe at the very end of gw2 the commander may ascend to godhood would be interesting...
---
Can some courageous US commander make something similar for us xD?
---
how big is the actual download size? because ive just gone past nearly 65GB downloaded, but the official site says its 50GB on disk
---
Actually playing Mirage in WvW roaming with all the ridiculous endurance regen/gain buffs and broken Trailblazers gear is like playing with godmode turned on. If you take the game a little more seriously, there is completely no point to play anything other than Condi Mirage. Although even if you play for fun, your fun ends when you meet that cancer cus unless the enemy is extremely bad, you know that you can't win. What is more if the Mirage player is at least mediocre, he can 1vX easily and never die.
---
While i don't care much for aurene ever since her sugar coated this-will-sell-tons-of-minis-and-plushies introduction, having her not return  is about as likely at the moment as having balthazar turn out to be a good guy who just want to have a cup of tea with you at the end of PoF after he spent most of his time stomping around, killing younglings and shouting how angry he is at everything.
---
Neither balthazar nor the yellow eyes blue dragon is something i agree with, but changing trajectory right now even if done for a plot twist is how i fear we get lazarus being balthazar.
---
What is important however is that there needs to be a cost. Even if she returns it might be that she literally turns into kralky and is mentally as well as physically affected by this transformation or something to that effect. The problem with the PC death is that you walk it off in 5 minutes, you return from the dead in just a moment and land on your feet running. It even gives you an edge in the form of scarab-be-gone. 
---
So while i'm sure aurene and even blish will return, the event still needs to be a tragedy. There has to be scars to show for it.
---
I am not gonna lie, i used to pvp and most of the time i had ABSOLUTELY no idea what I was doing. (Mesmer main)
---
Not even, literally spam clones and let them autoattack will usually win fights
---
I kinda expected this buddy. Sure you learned your thing after Halloween but HoT metas with multiboxing is so gray area it hurts. 
---
Even if you do a thing on every event with every open instance, you still would have to leave your other instances unattended while doing so. Dornsinger told me that’s gray area because it’s “not the intended gameplay”. (I wanted to multibox the Wintersday dungeon)
---
I think the final kicker however is, with this you take spots on the server of regular players away and they don’t like that? Well whatever it is, I guess the more this happens the clearer their statements get hopefully. 
---
It's no different to a Reaper minion master setting Nightfall to auto-attack and standing in a mob spawn area and AFK farming, and they're ok with that.
---

I have a hard time conjuring up sympathy for someone admittedly banned in the past for multiboxing (not his fault last time too), who feels like he's being watched by GMs.
---
Maybe quit playing on the fringes if you don't want to get ban hammered.
---
That desk is so nasty. How do you live like this?
---
Probably laughing from Silver
---
&gt; i have only played 1 match today and its in a custom arena, multiboxing is allowed in custom arenas.
---
so you probably got banned for multiboxing in competitive pvp yesterday or the day before.
---
This is becoming such a circlejerk but honestly i'm fine with it because Anet definitively has to do something with mesmer. It's been their golden child for too long.
---
&gt; And nobody cares, really.
---
Well, at least 23 people who downvoted do :3
---
Dunno, I didn't mean the comment as a derogatory one or something; I felt like the poster would sorta feel good that s/he "won" in the joke race with a good idea, thus my comment. Now I wonder if people actually saw it the opposite way: "Hey poster, this joke wasn't good enough for me to get up, but cool if it was good for you." /shrug
---
Chrome caused short freezes/stuttering for me. Using Firefox  instead fixed it.
---
It's very difficult to make such a comparison. GWAMM basically means you finished every part of the game and grinded some more titles. In GW2 it's difficult to make a comparison because there's no such thing as hard mode for pve or vanquisher (clearing hard mode pve areas), and the achievement system is much broader and scattered. In GW1 the selection of things needed to be done was slim. I guess you could say complete all story episodes and all expansion/LS achievements combined with all raid achievements or something, but that doesn't include anything grindy really. Maybe if you include Envoy's Herald, I don't know.
---
How do you guys find the on-going living story? 
---
Rather than shoving your tinfoil hat down onto your head as tight as you can as fast as you can, consider a practical explanation.
---
It's entirely possible that Anet partners sign a few things when *becoming* a partner that makes footage of their streams easier for Anet to use, legally speaking. 
---
This obscure attitude is one of the biggest problems with ArenaNet, we live in a constant state of uncertainty. We don't even know if there's going to be a third expansion.
---
Community-based games need roadmaps to give their customers clear expectations, or they will never get 100% invested on them.
---
Keep dreaming, people has been saying for about 4 years that Anet will do something.
---
She ate a lich and got its powers. I doubt she's gone forever.
---
Have you:
---
Master your class
---
Explored all dungeons
---
Completed all raids
---
Progress through fractals 1-100
---
Finished world completion, (Core, HoT, PoF)
---
Collections and achievements
---
Crafted a gen 2 legendary
---
These are just off the top of my head. If you feel fine with the game, it probably means that you are.
---
I don't know but I kinda was expecting that ending, it was spoiled in the previous chapter on her visions and I still don't think that's the real ending. There were many other scenes I loved like when Taimi was captured in Istan, it made me really anxious, this one didn't have much impact on me.
---
Uh, okay. Their reactions seem genuine to me, so I can't help you with your feelings.
---
Haha, 3 key??  Use a mouse and that key won’t wear you out!  Also, mouse click all skills to make the game more fun!!  /s
---
Thanks! Hopefully it'll be released this month, on my channel :) 
---
Extremely 
---
&gt;You don’t think the *massive* expense going into every bandwagon server migration isn’t generating gem revenue for ANet?
---
Comparatively not much, no. Pretty sure those happen seasonally, not constantly. Unlike gem store sales of skins and gold, which are constant. 
---
ANet has the data and knows where their bread is buttered, and as a result have chosen to prioritize new PvE maps and content ~four times a year, and new WvW maps every four years.
---
&gt;The reason they haven’t prioritized it is they simply haven’t figured out how best to monetize it.
---
Don’t hold your breath, they haven’t been able to do that for ~7 yrs so far. WvW just isn’t easily monetizeable, regardless whether server based or alliance based. The truth is, WvW and PvP players don’t spend on the game like PvE players do. Having been primarily a WvW player in the past, this shouldn’t really be news to anyone. 
---
Do you get a crash report / dump?

On NA there's a guild that does the farm for 2 hours on Sunday starting 2pm est. They post in lfg. I did it last week and still enjoyed it

Not accurate figures of course, but - the diehard raiding community is a subset of the GW2 community.  A small one.

Man, English is hard. Especially seeing as it’s my 256 language.

Amusingly, your image wouldn't load for me.

Well. They sell 2 mystic clovers a day for

150 fractal relics
---
3 Globs of Ectoplasm
---
2 Spirit Shards
---
1 Mystic Coin
---
Each. I believe you get enough fractal relics (Pristines included) a day to buy two. 
---
Oh yeah, that'd make sense! 
---
Because of your comment and couple others mentioning return from T6 etc, I did a bit more API magic and pulled together an average return on non-clover forges and used that to calculate new statistical costs to futureproof it a bit if/when prices change!
---
Just covering my bases before reddit grabs the pitchforks for me not giving them the benefit of the doubt :)

I should probably have updated the post, I just used "restore windows" on windows 10 and it works fine since.
---
I got a Guardian, Warrior and Rev on 80 and got full ascended berserker gear. I wanna make a second gear set but I don't know which one.
---
I mostly play Open World and T4 Fractals only with pugs. My first thought was Harrier to play support FB/Renegade but I've read they are not really that accepted in T4 at the moment.
---
Any recommendations?
---
I'm sorry man, but you are one of those, if it's not (explicitly) prohibited it's allowed.
---
I logged in, started cleaning up my builds and all that, then thought to myself "I should show him PvX too"  
---
[https://gwpvx.gamepedia.com/Build:Team\_-\_7\_Hero\_BiP\_Caster\_Support](https://gwpvx.gamepedia.com/Build:Team_-_7_Hero_BiP_Caster_Support)  
---
Not only did they update their builds, but their meta 7 hero team is now exactly the same as what I would normally run. They used to have a good team up there but many didn't consider it to be the best. The one that's up right now is perfect, though. Definitely run the Signet of Spirits hero instead of the Pain of Disenchantment one. You'll understand what I mean when you see it.  
---
Run that and you'll faceroll pretty much the whole game as long as you flag your heroes half decently and prioritize healers as ping targets. They have a melee variant of the team if you're playing warrior or something.  
---
If you ever invest in mercenary heroes, then a 4th mesmer is absolutely OP, though in my opinion running the Minion Master instead is more newbie friendly since the minions tank everything.  
---
Runes WILL make a huge difference. Attributes first, then the best vigor runes you can afford. Don't sweat it too much, +30hp ones are more than enough. The PvX page tells you what to get.  
---
I'm writing this in between two things, I might be missing things. Don't be afraid to ask me any question, I love this stuff.
---
Yup! I know about the fractal clovers (best way to get them btw!). 
---
But yeah, I think it'd have to be something extensive where it takes a few weeks to grind the achievement, and maybe a cap on how many you can get in a certain timeframe. 
---
But you're right, it's probably not necessary for all the different ways we have of getting clovers. 
---
Don't use that's 2 years old lmao. 
---
According to Gw2 efficiency, based on 200k accounts, 30% of players cleared at least once VG. 
---
The Undefeated achiev, no one dying in W1, was unlocked by 15% of the community. 
---
20% of players cleared the first 3 bosses of W4, while 15% cleared Deimos. 
---
20% of all players own at least 10LI. 10% own 150LI. 
---
Small numbers still, but not 5%. A lot of work by the community has been done in order to put more people raiding. However, there is still this idea that you have to achiev 35K dps or kick and you must play what SC tells you to play. Also there is this stigma that all raiders are elitists and because there aren't enough people playing, finding a group takes ages. At least in EU that's not the case. 
---
I usually hate seeing these kind of caracter, but I must admit your last pic made me change my mind on this one. Well played :'D
---
Core Guardian built around survivability/condition cleansing can SOMEWHAT repel mediocre Mirages (as in, make them run away while you're capping a point), but amount of awareness it takes vs buttons pushed on the other side indeed favors Mesmer.
---
Also, one will struggle to kill anything with such a build, so yeah.
---
inb4 mounts and everyone hates it
---
A Norn so ridiculous that Issormir, Mordremoth, Zhaitan, Balthazar and Bolo killed themself to avoid the humiliation of being killed bu this man. 
---
I am also fairly new to wvw. I dont know what you are talking about. I dont like wvw because ranger 1shot from 10miles, mirage clutter spam and thief 1shot and long travel times finally to be ganked by one of the above. Zergs are pretty fun but damage is till over the top there too but you atleast have a chance there with support.
---
Oh, I just switched out the armor after she appeared so I could tell the two apart. She was around for a while before she despawned, so I had a bit of time to play around with the screenshots I was took. I can put up another with the same ones if you'd like. 
---
Given their attention to festivals over current events (yeah those are kinda gone now) I think SAB3 is on the horizon, if not this year, the next. 
---
Not sure if they have plans to bring Dragon Bash, if they do plan it for this year, maybe SAB won't get World3, who knows. 
---
WvW rewards for a new player are an order of magnitude better now than they were before the changes. If your reasoning were valid, WvW would have ceased to exist years ago. 
---
Good
---
Or, just don't multibox and you won't get banned
---
I think its totally worth it to get lw season 3 for you, its by far the easiest way to get ascended accessories. If youre in a guild, guild missions are also a good way to at least get berserker trinkets. There are also the Fraktal Trinkets available, with these you can even freely choose the stats. I thinn thats the best option, you should have a few Pristine Fractal Relics lying around to easily purchase them. 
---
Another way to upgrade your Ar is by upgrading your Infusions. Its worth it to go to +9 on Rings.
---
Just do low level areas. Loot scales to you and since you're downscaled, the effect of gear won't hit you too hard. It helps you catch up in gear and helps if you ever decide to do world completion.
---
Least, that's what I did when I came back a few weeks ago.
---
The OP meant another branded Aurene, a doppleganger. 
---
Late March for me.
---
Thank you. That's what I figured, but wasn't totally sure. Are items on any kind of rotating schedule or is it more like... SURPRISE!
---
Very frequent AoEs that inflict massive damage and launching/knockdown (been a while, don't remember which) if you don't run out of the orange circle or dodge in time. Get hit with two or three of those, and you're going down. Turrets don't stand a chance.
---
It's not like other centaur areas where you can just destroy the trebuchets, either. They're always up, all the time.
---
I agree, it would be nice to filter out already unlocked items. 
---
In the meantime, I’ve used gw2efficiency for this. You can do amazing things like go to Dyes, show only locked, sort by price ascending, then buy those off the TP. And use the site to look for sales too. You can do this with dyes, miniatures, skins, finishes, mounts, etc.

Wow, really well written
---
WvW rank is the issue for me.
---
One of my WvW goals is the mistforged armour set which I think are awesome, but 1500 WvW rank when you get like 5 ranks an hour if you are lucky and using a bunch of boosters sucks. I get that people who only play WvW will easily have this, or people who have played it intermittently over the past x years will easily have this but as a lowly rank 60 it feels like a goal that would take multiple years.
---
I'm close to the equivalent PvP armour set of rank 100 which is way more achievable while still being extremely hard. With PvP you can usually just jump in at any time and play a couple of matches whereas for WvW I feel it is only fun when running around with a zerg which are not always present as well as it only being 'worth it' if you stay in the game mode for hours.
---
Lots of people in WoW raid.   
---
If they cannot find party they go with raid finder :) 
---
attacking Stonemist and all of a sudden 50 Griffons divebomb your zerg...
---
maybe the s *nazi* ko
---
No they are no dumb enough to implement mounts without these restrictions. No one is.
---
I didn't even notice that...
---
Its something that has been circulating through several raid discords since before last christmas. As I said, I dont have a definite source on it, but tbh, I wouldnt be too surprised about it.
---
It might also be something as benign as "last raid for living story 4"... really Ive heard so many rumors regarding this... mainly because Anet doesnt say anything ;)
---
I like the idea that the Dream tries to neutralize threats, but I thought that the Pale Tree was a Scion of Mordremoth. I know she had the corruption cleansed, but so did Glint. I guess I missed the other Blighting Trees in Maguuma. I'm reading about them now.
---
that's how wvw works
---
Needs an option for "Open game for log in rewards then leave and come back tomorrow"
---
Heh, fair enough.
---
I'm not sure exactly what you're suggesting... But it seems like you're wanting to lower the Rank needed for bonus pips? Personally, I don't think there is much of an issue there. Whether it is rank 20 or Rank 150, it still requires a fair bit of commitment for a new player so it may not solve as much as you're hoping for.
---
Also, I don't think the lack of Pips for the early Ranks is what will drive players off from WvW. Even if you do get a couple more Pips, the rewards don't improve that much since the Skirmish Rewards are just a bunch of WvW currencies that are harder to apply a value to compare to PvE's sellable rewards. Like all you get is a chest with a bunch of WvW stuff with the only obvious sellable thing being a 10S dye, 1-2 8S crafting materials, some reward track progress, and some WvW currency that you'll need a lot of to buy anything notable ontop a bunch of those 8S crafting items and usually some Gold. Even if you can get Skirmish chests more easily, I don't think those rewards will entice new players as much as other rewards.
---
Personally, I think the bigger issue with WvW is how many systems are in play. You get standard loot off of Players and NPCs, you get Rank Up Chests from WvW Exp, you get Skirmish Chests from Pips, and you get Reward Track Loot from Reward Track Progress. While they are generally all earned from the same things, that is a lot of different systems to wrap your head around. It doesn't help that you have to set your Reward Track, which can be easy to miss and it isn't too obvious which would give the rewards you may want.
---
And out of those, I'd say the World Rank Chests feel the most lackluster because they are the only one you directly work on instead of being passive through participation and with how seldom you can get them, it is always disappointing to open it and see 30S and a couple of green items. I mean it does have the chance of rare items and even Ascended Gear, but the majority of the time it is pretty lacking. So I'd say it is more a combination of killing stuff to get normal champion loot, leveling up to get about the same loot as running around Queensdale, and then passively getting reward chests that are mostly WvW stuff that is hard to place value on that would discourage new players more than a lack of Pips.
---
Griffon who?
---
I somehow feel like this is something that'll make everyone go "Wow!" for a day or 2 then everyone realizes it solves no issues and WvW is probably still gonna be trash. We'll see though.
---
No thanks. 
---
I dip my toes into WvW and PvP every now and then and I honestly believe that most players will just avoid those modes like the plague. Ill use PvP as an example because the same problems are present in WvW (to a large extent). I remember in PvP you used to have the problem of bunker builds that you literally couldnt kill, now you have the total oppose, burst and dead. Most times you get no warning, it becomes a straight you caught them first or they caught you; there is no time to learn, just one(ish) shot gameplay. This also leads to certain classes being outright broken. Similarly in WvW, you have mostly ZvZ and your Z will either sufficiently blow their Z up or they will blow your Z up; there are more defensive mechanics at play in WvW, but the average person will not be able to see them as things often happen to quickly and it generally becomes a number game.
---
WvW, when I first started playing the game (since beta) has been a mix of PvE and PvP, and I think it should emphasis the PvE more. Player damage should just get an overall, flat, decrease when damaging other players, not NPC--its easier to adjust NPC health pools and evade mechanics than 9 classes dps and mechanics. Then, NPCs should be given bigger importance. Objectives should be made more important, even small ones, to encourage players to try to support NPCs, even small objective ones that contribute to larger objectives. Players will be able to fend off other players in these NPC objectives, but the fights wont be burst fests, perhaps focusing more on control and making the fight the offense players trying to overwhelm the NPCs despite defense players efforts.
---
In either case, I think something fundamental should change because right now its just blob v blob with massive rez recovery time as you have to run across a giant landscape.
---
random siege weapons revamp
---
From a UX standpoint it might work better to highlight locked items - a subtle background color in the table cell would draw the eye without cluttering up the interface.
---
"extremely awesome". We'll see how this plays out. Get ready for extreme baby rage I guess.
---
they'll only significantly rise again when the next LNY comes around. either sell them now, or stack some MF and open them.
---
Your best bet is going to be making a ranger or some other ranged class. Deadeyes and mirages are gonna be super annoying no matter what.
---
Gw1 mesmer: skill
---
Gw2 mesmer: smash your head on the keyboard- win
---
Both are pretty viable.
---
The balloon got me.
---
Nah, play the game like a normal person and you've got nothing to worry about.
---
Something's most likely stopping those files from being downloaded on your computer, probably a firewall/antivirus. I recommend adding gw2 as an exception to all of those and/or temporarily turning them off.
---
**Weapons**
---
Probably best to aim for a weapon first - depending on your class I'd see if the Elite Specialization weapon from Path of Fire works for your build - its a cheap ascended weapon which you can complete for less than 4g but does require some running about in the desert. You can stat swap these in the Mystic forge if required. This gives you two infusion slots - stick +7's in these (total 14 AR)
---
**Backpieces**
---
Ascended backpieces are given out like candy from a lot of achievements (i.e. usually free). Every ascended backpiece starts off with a single infusion slot - stick a +8 in this (total 22 AR). Optionally you can infuse the backpiece to potentially add a second slot but this is kinda expensive, don't bother until later.
---
**Trinkets**
---
If you're going for a power build, there's a lot of easy vendors with Berserker attribute trinkets. [wiki search](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/index.php?title=Special:RunQuery/Equipment_query&amp;Equipment_query%5Brarity%5D=Ascended&amp;Equipment_query%5Bsupertype%5D=Trinket&amp;Equipment_query%5Bprefix%5D=Berserker&amp;wpRunQuery=true). Be sure to buy different rings and different accessories since you can't equip two identical items.
---
If you're going for a healing, utility or condi build then I agree with r-LAWninetynine - buying the LWS3 episode "A Crack in the Ice" for access to Bitterfrost Frontier gives you easy access to Rings and Trinkets.
---
In the two accessories you'll get 1 slot each, put a +9 in each of these (total 40 AR).
---
In the two rings you can cheaply [attune](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Attuned_equipment) both of these to gain 2 slots on each ring, put a +9 in each of these (total 76 AR). Just like backpieces, you can also infuse rings to gain a pair of extra slots - again this is expensive and leave this until later. You can use an [Infusion Extraction Device](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Infusion_Extraction_Device) when you later decide to infuse the rings.
---
**Armor**
---
Do this after the above as it is really expensive to put a complete set together. This does however give you an additional 6 slots (put a +8 in each of these).
---
Always be worried when they touch wvw

Uuuh siege skins, I like it. 
---
We know Mordremoth covers the domain of Plants and Minds, but we only know that Kralk covers Crystal. My guess is the second domain is something like Prophecy since that seems to be a recurring thing with those dragons.
---
So assuming the Pale Tree/Grove/Dream did inherit some of Mordremoth's abilities, it seems their future-telling is more tied to Mind than Prophecy. But the whole Pale Tree and the Dream thing is left pretty ambiguous with how it all works and its connection to the mists. She was able to give us a vision hinting at future events so she does seem to have some control over that stuff, but whether that was a prophecy or just a displaying of things known within the Dream is hard to say.
---
Uh oh.. 
---
I believe they announced that they're announcing something "WvW related" next week (and it's not the Alliances system). It could be rewards, since Raymond did say he wanted to work on that after World Restructuring/Alliances.

I'm kinda in that boat, I was honestly starting to play mesmer more with my guild so I wanted to just get better in general, doing PvP Mirage is kinda stupid, but yeah, I just do what is needed, dont get salty or rage at peope, just try to be polite and positive, in the end it's a game so I try even if it's broken to not be an asshole about it at least.
---
Its WvW content from WvW devs...worried of course
---
Brother, if the router has to take a different route because of the way the Anets server works, then it is server-side. If other games use a more favorable route, then the reason I’m getting disconnects at the end of story missions (which was the purpose of the post in the first place), is because Anets servers don’t use favorable routes, still making it an Anet issue and not a client side issue. I would be experiencing this problem in every other game if it were the way that my router goes through, but since I am not the only one who has problems with only Anet and not other games, it’s can’t be me. This isn’t about fixing router issues, this is about holding a company accountable for keeping their product up to standards, and pulling those standards down in “defense” of them just causes shit like EA to happen. Maybe next time you should think things through before trying to act smart and talk like you know exactly what others are experiencing. 
---
Seeing as how mounts are tied to the mastery system I doubt it. I am kind of hoping its the return of a WvW season.
---
funnily enough, so did you ;P
---
Lv. 1 Invader vs Lv. 100 Diamond Legend
---
Anything that would make WvW rewards less of a ridiculous time grind is welcome. I personally really enjoy hopping into WvW but unlike in other game modes it feels like unless you invest silly hours, rewards are hard to come by, and I am mostly talking about skins here.
---
......
---
Its....
---
PERFECT!

Community: We want better optimization 
---
Anet: no
---
Alright, how long are you willing to go without content and/or other changes for this to be a reality? 
---
I liked EotM when I could level up my characters there ...
---
I really hope this happens, even if it’s against all odds.
---
Teapot is either playing or casting with Frostball.
---
Not sure what they decided on.
---
All gen 2 legendaries except for Chuka &amp; Champawat (shortbow), Astralaria (axe), H.O.P.E. (pistol), and Nevermore (Staff) are the definition of ptw. You literally buy a ton of crafting materials and sit for an hour or two to make everything you need. They were designed to be little more than sinks for tier 5 crafting materials. The only thing you have to actually do in-game to make them is explore HoT maps (or in the case of legendaries introduced after PoF was released, explore PoF maps and kill a bunch of bounties).
---
The four legendaries I named above can ONLY be unlocked by doing specific tasks in the game (in addition to needing a bunch of crafting materials). Chuka &amp; Champawat is especially well-regarded for being fun to make.
---
&gt;Community: We want better optimization while also getting new content and features at a faster pace.
---
FTFY
---
The thing is, that is not realistic. People do shout about optimization, but plenty of the same people also tend to be very vocal when there is even the slightest content drought. 
---
Fact remains that it is not realistic for them to work on this while at the same time also releasing new content and/or features so it is basically one or the other, and lets be honest: They won't earn any money on optimization. 
---
I second that. I actually don’t mind the reward system that much, it’s more that I don’t have any fun unless I’m in a group because there’s not much you can do on your own unless you’re playing one of the mentioned classes that dominate all others.
---
I always tell people my confirmation-biased observation -- doing "let me forge for clovers" in WvW when you just log in after the reset has higher odds for me. But then I can just do 1 or 2 rolls a day and leave it at that instead of "I need to mystic toilet for 77 clovers RIGHT NOW"
---
are those builds suited well to pugs, or only organized groups?
---
As a player that only came in less than a year ago I'm well aware that the rewards gained are lackluster in comparison to time/effort spent in pve...
---
but really I LOVE wvw and atleast get to mithril every week. I had an old account from launch on FA though so finding a good pugmander really isn't that hard. We may not accomplish alot some nights but getting your ass randomly kicked is just part of the game mode. 
---
If you're on a crap server cause you're new that's what's discouraging. 
---
I doubt the people who make content are the same people who do the engine optimization
---
&gt;Community &amp; Anet: We want better optimization
---
&gt;
---
&gt;~~Anet~~ NCSoft: no
---
Fixed that for you.
---
No way. Anet will release new game before optimizing the mess that is gw2.
---
I still wonder how much they could manage even with few people dedicated to performance improvements. (Even 1-2)
---
Do they even have software engineers dedicated to maintaining the engine?
---
Mounts are definetlly not the thing that wvw needs, or if they are they have to be drasicly different and not only from content point of view, but also implementation. You just can't have double the models if everyone is using a mount
---
A 400+ minion company should be able to do both. Unless their resource managment is similar to their coding skills.
---
well the money they get from people buying everything from gemstore seems a nice income from the annual reports people like to boast about in this subreddit, which doesn't explain why content and engine is so draught.
---
Aside resources on making maps people play for 2 hours and then abandon is not exactly a good way to use resources... Should just stop putting new maps over and over for each episode and instead doing more story within already present maps.
---
Guess it's another start citizen management style...
---
&gt;  they usually opt for a map with the outnumbered buff, only turn camps and hate WvW for the rest of their life.
---
Which is EXACTLY what I will do for that Gift of Battle later today.
---
&gt;Btw, what's the distro and how GW2 behaves under it?
---
Ubuntu Budgie 18.04 on a Ryzen 5 2600 + 1050Ti (390.77 driver), via Crossover 18.1 (paid support release of wine). Had to dial back settings a couple ticks below max to get to 30fps, get a tiny bit of stuttering (and also this glitch) right after load screens but otherwise very stable. This is a fairly new setup, need to play on it a while longer before deciding whether to go crazy with tweaks or just throw a bigger GPU at it. 
---
Sadistic because I find people who call everything "predictable" no matter what happens instead of just enjoying things?
---
It is a character in a story. There is nothing sadistic here, but nice try.
---
I find your attitude to be entirely projectory and I find your opinion unnecessary.
---
Also for pug carry purposes power FB can be replaced by heal fb in this composition
---
and a player for 0 revenue made dx12 support for gw2... so the point is?
---
I mean, they could probably manage a bit, but it would take a shitton of time. Especially considering the age of the engine and the fact that many of the people creating the engine in the first place probably don't even work at the company anymore. 
---
Lol foot key
---
Yeah you gotta obey the law of 3 that was in that redpost. If you trigger all 3 rules u violate.
---
I got the volatile gathering tools about a week ago don't know if they are still there but should be on the utility or upgrade section. Can be bundled together with different things that can be worth having a look at. 
---
PS: Life is better with infinite gathering tools
---
Have an pm me on here if you can or get me an in game name
---
The end of the jp is not always by the chest, if you took a portal up you may need to wonder around a little to find the end point. If you did the jp then you shuttle have got it and it may have been bugged, get up their with portal and see if you can find the end point again. 
---
Fixing a server crash?
---
You are an idiot... More pve in wvw.. lol.
---
How much gold would you say it takes to make a p2w one?
---
Healing Rene is better and sacrifices less DPS.
---
looks great, you can push ctrl+shit+H to hide the overlay so you can get a more clear picture without the skills and minimap. me and a friend made lore for our characters and had fun with it. We took off the overlay and made use of the camera movement to take pictures from a different perspective.

---
They aren't afk. When I do map comp and run past them, I usually greet them with "hello bots" and they respond
---
Can you noooooooot!?
---
You dont care what is written in the policy? so if you get suspended for something which explicitily is allowed in the freaking policy you or others should be okay with it? You cant be serious.
---
I have been suspended for offensive language 2 times, 1 of them appealed few hours later. This was a few years ago and i have not been suspended or warned about offensive language since then, beacuse i dont do it anymore, beacuse its not worth it and i know the outcome.
---
2 suspensions which has to do with multiboxing if u include this one, the one i was suspended 3 months ago was beacuse i didnt respond to a GM whispering me in halloween labyrinth. When i was moving my characters to the centre of the map. 
---
My characters was teleported that time also, i moved them away from the spot which was just on the edge of the map but did not write anything in chat or watch if anything was written in chat. I just focused on getting my characters to the centre of the map which was my destination.
---
Yes, i have said stupid shit during pvp matches, and so have others, i have said immature things, and i deserve the suspensions i got from that. But no, i dont think my 3 month suspension for simply not responding to a whisper is justifiable, especially not this one when the policy explicitly states multiboxing in custom arenas IS allowed.
---
All day, every day? Really? You're gonna try this hard to defend such an obvious farm? 
---
For who's quality of life is this? To obtain more mediocre rewards faster and complete dailies faster? Why make this more complicated?
---
They only need roller beetle.
---
ncsoft owns anet, while they might give them a free hand (you never know), they will always have the last word in anything.
---
well source is opensource differently than gw2skills and gw2efficency so you can put up your own instance.
---
One major reason i prefer it to gw2efficency aside the more clean interface.
---
I did this back some years ago and was nicely running on a raspberypi
---
no one cares what you doubt
---
I would see them regardless because I have enemy names always visible.
---
They're probably working on their usual Living World content (new maps, legendaries, fractals, raids, etc). They're likely working on the next expansion as well, but thats obviously on the distant horizon.
---
It's Z*haitan*.
---
You don't have to stop doing everything else to focus on that one long term goal. It does take 2-3 years and it does progress when you put some time on it. I ranked 330 two years ago and almost 1600 now. I only play when I enjoy it. There are weeks I hit diamond chests multiple times and those I skipped on the wood chest. Looking back I learn how to play smarter with the objectives in mind: k-train in between massive blob fights, objective defense during daily completion, etc.
---
33354 AP by the ways, I did everything you mentioned above and more. WvW still gives me that 'I'm a novice' feeling and a really long term goal to enjoy.
---
ArenaNet is terrible at managing their team anyway. A couple of hours of content every 3 months is hardly to write home about. Maybe work on the engine after the next expansion when there's finally some content to be done again.
---
That's a silly comparison. Someone doing something in their own time is different from someone doing something to satisfy shareholders.
---
Gross people are gross.
---
Its an automated ticket response like always, they dont customize each suspension notification all cases of multiboxing gives that message, i dont use any 3rd party tools other then launchbuddy which doesnt alter guildwars 2 and is greenlit by Anet. Btw this is not something i pull out of my a$$ but confirmed by their lead GM.
---
He's the resident anet whiteknight. You should just downvote him and move on as most others do. 
---
I'd personally disagree that allowing Aurene to remain dead will necessarily be a bad move narratively. And it certainly wouldn't be like the Lazarus reveal, since there's pretty well established alternative means of fulfilling the same exact role that Aurene was intended to.
---
The only issue would come if it's overall ignored, like the PC dying and coming back to life as you say. Though resurrection in GW1 did allow those who died to get back on their feet and run immediately (literally and metaphorically), when it was done for the plot in Factions, the PC had a debt to repay to the resurrectors (the Envoys) and they were constantly popping in and out to not only remind the PCs of this debt, but give advice on how to fulfill it (stopping Shiro, which they couldn't do due to the restrictions of being an Envoy).
---
Exactly! 
---
So do I but there's definitely a big difference in visibility, you can fully see people at the very bottom while regularly if you could (which I'm not sure of) it would be much harder to notice.
---
I've always been interested in working in the gaming industry but I think if I was offered a job at anet, I'd pass. There's been a load of churn for a game that's only six years old. 
---
I never beat Dhuum, but my HoM says I still completed the UW. I don't even  know if Dhumm was added to the game when I did it. Dhuum is honestly the ONLY thing I never got around to doing, but I hear he's insanely tough. I saw a video of a fight with him, and he's got insane attack speed.
---
Can we just make multiboxing illegal and actively ban violators? It is messing up the economy and perpetrators hardly even actually *play* the game.
---
I wish you weren't getting downvoted, because you're absolutely right. I still managed to start crying while watching this video. And yes, they are bragging about this, as if it's some amazing accomplishment of theirs. It wasn't imo, it feels cheap and is obviously done for shock value.
---
The devs dug this hole for themselves over the past 15 years of working on the engine.
---
No?
---
Ya, Under Water WvW Map. LOL...
---
Sure, but how many more people would leave the game if they didn't release any content? 
---
No. We just don't like people being going like "Just turn DirectX 12 on 4Head", every other day.
---
1. Close launcher.
---
2. Go in run&gt; %temp% &gt; delete all files there.
---
3. Disable firewall.
---
4. Run launcher.
---
5. Play another game with launcher in background. ( Sometimes the launcher gives ass speed unless there's something else running idk why )
---
all that was fine in gw1 when you couldnt have it all at once
---
not so much in gw2
---
I guess they can but i dont think suspending players for abiding to 
---
 their official polcicies would bode well for the players, new or potential ones.
---
Also good on you for not getting banned.
---
/s?
---
&gt; incentive 
---
Fuck YOU!
---
They should disable the whole bigger shit of an area, FUck all!
---
I was brand new to WvW just over a year ago. Nothing turned me away from the mode, so I'd rather disagree with you OP. If a person is "fit" for the mode, they'll stick around regardlessly.
---
i think you are out of the loop. there are no raiders testing with anet anymore.
---
They forced players into raids to unlock masteries to not lose experience look at the most recent wing. The numbers are abysmal. 
---
bullsackfoballs 
---
What the hell is this reply, lol? Why are people on this subreddit so angry?
---
I don't know what's going on with you but you clearly have some big unresolved issues there, buddy. Best of luck.
---
Engineer Holosmith form, Tornado form, whirlpool form and plauge swarm form transformations all can cause this bug. It's pretty nuts for engineers.
---
And that person? Hodor of Winterfel
---
Why are you so conspiracy oriented? 
---
How many dungeon runs would it take to unlock all weapon/armor skins?
---
it already has a filter panel for rarity and stats, they could just put hide unlocked as one more option in there.
---
I don't know if it's required now or not. Dhuum was added later, that's true
---
Nah, just the vocal ones on Reddit. I understand complaining after playing and disliking something, but before even knowing what it is is just extremely stupid and how you disincentivize any form of communication.
---
/r/InsanePeopleReddit 
---
For something like the first year of release you needed to complete a boss in a raid to unlock the masteries to be able to get xp again. They ended up changing it eventually but it forced a lot of players who wanted nothing to do with raids into doing them which explains sone of the super inflated numbers from the first wing.
---
your post
---
I mean majority of players ingame and on this subreddit have a "hatred" for multiboxers so i am not really surprised. But it doesnt have to be multiboxing, apply it to something else that is is in the policies and there would be an outcry.
---
There are ways around that if it’s the case.
---
To be frank though, going off the games shaky development over the past 6 years not to mention NCsoft wanting faster produced expansions and getting nowhere, them stepping in might improve things.
---
For those with mounts and gliders.  If you believe the rewards are mediocre, why not request to make it better?
---
Portals are the de facto fastest way to complete it.  Disabling features except portals is backwards thinking.
---
Do you want to do the puzzle or not?  If yes: ask to make it worthwhile.  If no: take the portal, tip your mesmer, and move on.
---
Did not try to contact customer support in my title or in any of my comments in this thread, neither did i stirr up any drama.
---
Why is this suspension not worthy to stay up with the recent policy changes and my videos and screenshots proving i was banned for something explicitily allowed in the updated policies, seems pretty relevant to me.
---
Sure, just play on a core account only.
---
Cute.
---
How have I NEVER seen this before? I don't use Elixir X much, but I'm almost always running Holosmith and toggling Photon Forge in fights. This is crazy. 
---
I think they got us plenty of content in those years. Yes the engine is not good anymore but it was and it provided with a good game so i dont criticize them for using it then. I do criticize them for not moving on with times but they could think it isnt the time yet and thats where our opinion's diverge but i atleast understand their pov.
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I don't doubt it, but you ruin the game for the actual players.
---
Or "just rework the engine"
---
That's not true.  FB+ren are both much easier to play than proper chrono, so if one of them is build as a healer, this is probably the best composition to pull off on a decent level by bad players. Especially if chrono isn't going to do anything but the most basic stuff.
---
On other hand good chrono can provide a lot of utility outside of  bossfights and, depending on daily fractals, can shave a lot of time off the fullclear. In this case decent players can also just ditch druid and get pretty much the same damage output in bossfights too. 
---
to be fair 6 years is a rather long time to be working at one place in this day and age.
---
Stop! It’s already dead... D:
---
(windows dpi scaling still sucks on my laptop...)
---
I love how people think this is like flipping a switch for Anet and they're just back there, casually smirking as they taunt us with this holy grail of performance. These things require massive engine re-writes this is not a 'flip switch' thing. Also keep in mind the budget between companies. While Anet isn't small by any stretch they arn't Blizzard when it comes to income, along side having a multi-billion dollar publisher behind them like Activision.
---
And lastly, Blizzard's engine for WoW is not even close to the same for Gw2 a 35% gain in WoW for multi-thread support could be a 5% increase in Gw2 due to engine limitations. Goodness people do some research on this stuff.
---
In closing, WoW is a sinking ship right now that Blizzard is trying to patch holes for, they're content is slow (Sometimes as slow as 6+ months before a release) while being a subscription-based game. Now imagine the dev time sacrificed to bring this to Gw2.
---
Oh good, let’s make sticking together in a giant blob even easier!
---
WoW has a bigger team and is also backed by Blizzard. No matter how much Anet wants to, they can't compete with a budget like that either
---
while warframe has certainly changed a lot since i played it, i do still believe that it's fundamentally different to GW2 in terms of optimization.  
---
(Closed-off areas with heavy frustrum culling, not as many characters on screen at the same time, and so on)  
---
i also believe that it's a smaller undertaking than what re-writing the GW2/GW1 engine would be.  
---
but yeah. a man can dream.
---
And events is the only thing added on the new maps right? 
---
The hamsters are less annoying?
---
Here's a small list of things that could be what will be coming. Some a much more unlikely than others though.
---
* Mounts
---
* 3rd BL map so there would be a special one for each team
---
* Legendary trinkets
---
* Legendary weapons only aquisition. (Obsidian weapons would fit great as precursors into a similar system as the legendary WvW armor)
---
* Yet another special event and bonus WXP week
---
Wiki says 1380 total tokens for armor skins,  6,150 for weapons. That's 7,530 total. Since you get 100 tokens per run once per day that's about 76 runs. If you run all 3 paths every day it'll take you 26 days.
---
(This doesn't count any BLC or PvP/WvW means of getting tokens, or the 300-token reward for running 8 different paths.)
---
Which is technically GW1. No?
---
am i included in "people"?  
---
even for blizzard, this is a big undertaking and a lot of money is going into it.  
---
i don't believe we as a community can estimate the performance changes it would bring, in fact i don't believe Anet themselves can get an accurate estimate.  
---
i DEFINITELY think this is related to the recent bumps in the road, with the diablo fiasco and the huge dive in stocks just days ago.
---
It sucks in group content since the burst is low on targets with huge healthpool (basically whole end game) and it requires you to stay at max range for its full potential (and in such content you need to stay close to each other, preferably in melee range).
---
It's good for open world and solo content, just like it says.
---
I really love playing Scourge against those, because they can't seem to escape the radius of my sand shades.
---
Maybe one day I would upload one, but for now Im taking a break, i need it cuz i was not having a whole lot of fun in PvP. After the patch lets see how things are.
---
Went down against the biggests shiny of all, what a lad
---
Eh, vocal ones on official forums too, tbh. And in-game from what I've seen.
---
uhhh people in WvW don't want the rewards to be any quicker to achieve than they already are. Otherwise what else do we have to grind for? 
---
Field cannons again?
---
Swiftness caps (almost) speed out of combat. Signets and similar buffs give less, but enough speed.
---
go on then, give examples where a gpu pipeline/rendering dev would be needed in creating new content.
---
Do i understand it correctly that the main reason you would run this rune over pack rune is the vigor, or am i missing something?
---
TBH, as an exclusive necro main, I have to admit that Scourge is ezmode too.
---
They're damned if they do and they're damned if they don't
---
So is WoW's, FFXIV's, and ... I dunno about ESO's engine.
---
It doesn't matter. I used this number to highlight company size. Such big company should be able to multitask and they probably do - but not for gw2.
---
Close enough.
---
&gt; You can't really blame them though.
---
I can, because they are responsible for making the engine such a mess. It shows lack of foresight and long term plans which tells a lot about their higher management.
---
This is exactly how I feel about it. Several years is completely reasonable for the most exclusive reward.
---
ANet clearly has great people working on the server backend, and great artists.
---
But when it comes to the client and performance optimization, it doesn't seem they have as much talent working there. 
---
So the servers work great and the game looks great, but even with a monster machine getting over 30fps, let alone over 60fps, is but a pipe dream.
---
I fear that even if they hired  some optimization virtuoso to fix that, the improvements would not be that great because of how maps are designed to favor looks over performance. You keep seeing things like lots of unused assets no one will see unless they map break, but that won't be filtered out by Umbra's occlusion culling because of how they are placed. I still have slowdowns some times when I approach Silverwastes keeps as the stuff underground gets loaded all at the same time too soon. 
---
just as a sign of disrespect 
---
ESO's engine is capped at 100 fps. 
---
definitely not needed, they're getting enough money from the BLTC.  
---
the problem is most likely that investing in that rework won't bring any revenue, and crowdfunding would be shitty PR at best.
---
There is also opportunity cost. How much revenue would they get from optimizing the engine? How much revenue would they lose from making slower content releases due to devs pulled off to work on the engine?
---
I'm sorry to hear you can't play the game, but there's absolutely a team of financial analysts at ANet who've worked over this issue and determined they would lose more revenue if they spent time optimizing the engine over pushing out content releases.
---
So if they make PvE shit you know like in WoW right now and they keep on adding shit noone ask for and keep on doing it for years and people are upset about it and people complain about it and keep on getting this stuff in PvE anyway. Is it the PvE players fault or is it the devs making things noone asks for and don't give what asked for? Or is it the devs not giving us what us the dedicated wvw players ask for? And should we shut up and be happy even though it break WvW further?
---
You can swap builds for free though, there's no reason to cripple yourself by something thats mediocre everywhere when you can play different builds in different content. Gear is the same anyway, you just need to swap one weapon set and maybe a few traits.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9ntaqg/gw2_graphics_engine/  - 
---
It requires extensive application rework to get any performance improvements in GW2.
---
World of Warcraft (WoW) - Patch 8.1 is expected to utilise DirectX 12 MT and a 15% performance FPS improvement is anticipated in current BETA / Public test server testing:
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=287727/new-multithread-optimizations-coming-in-patch-8-1-tides-of-vengeance
---
WoWs initial conversion from DX11 to DX12 gained NO performance improvements!
---
Its an iterative development process which is required, a bit of a journey.. glad to see it was now +35% perf imp instead of +15%
---
keeping assets out of bounds is not a waste, since this will ensure that it's loaded into memory whenever an instance of it is needed.  
---
it may slow you down overall, but it's better than having a huge performancehit whenever that mob spawns in front of you and your PC suddenly has to load it.
---
If they really don't have plans to release a GW3 in the rather near future (say like 2-3 years) then this would really enhance the longevity of GW2 and improve the overall feel of the game a ton. 
---
Please make it happen Anet!
---
There's also sound effect for circles and yellow border on the edge of your screen when you step on them.
---
Circles are also dark blue/purple, while mesmer stuff is usually light and pink.
---
So you're argument is that its complete coincidence? Riiiight
---
Guild Wars 76!
---
You also get a guaranteed tokens chest every 10
---
When playing on my 2880x1800 MacBook Pro in Windows 10, the best settings are to render with subsampling enabled, DPI scaling enabled, and the UI set to medium. The GUI renders at 2880x1800, with super sharp text, and the game renders at 1440x900. If you drop the entire thing to 1/2 resolution, your putting the GUI and 3D elements through the crappy bilinear upscaling, which will make the text blurry. 
---
Oh i won't need that anymore, crafted ad infinitum two days ago
---
yeah you're right about that. get the cafeteria people to code the new engine in between their regular shift, it's not witchcraft after all
---
Enjoy your report honey
---
a weekend event
---
Today's daily jp (griffonrock) has a nice feature as well with the bomb on a timer. Forces you completely to run through the puzzle without being hit, making this one a nice challenge.
---
It says a lot about what their higher management was like pre-2012 which is completely irrelevant today. And honestly, if you've worked in a place where game devs are crunching for a release deadline, you would understand why corners would get cut.
---
What's the discussion? You've proposed implementing a more complicated solution to a problem that doesn't exist. Puzzles have never been focused on rewards.
---
Like you said, there already exists the fastest way to skip puzzles. My impression is youd like a faster way to get your daily done without a mesmer.
---
This helps nobody.
---
What rank are you at? I know yours is between 50-59, but I wonder how 500 plays can reach what rank.
---
Tonics can cause it too, happens to my ele all the time in WvW when I'm spamming the candy corn gobbler for the exp booster.
---
I don't think anet are as much of optimization gods as Blizzard are. Say what you want about WoW, but that game runs crisp despite how old it is and how many graphical updates there have been. If anything we'll just need to hope gw3 runs on an engine capable of optimization, because, at least the impression i'm getting, gw2's doesn't have any room for optimization unfortunately.
---
35% from what? Did it go from 10 to 13.5?
---
To everyone pointing out GW2 runs on a modified GW1 engine.  I am pretty sure WoW originally ran on a modified Warcraft 3 engine.  No idea if it still does, but its important to point out.
---
They have a lot of time for expac 3, so maybe then... 
---
Calling WoW's engine bad? Now I know you're just pulling shit out of your ass, it's an amazing engine and the fact they can optimize it so much proves so. FFXIV's too, I personally barely drop FPS even in massive gatherings of people which can't be said for GW2 most certainly.
---
If you go by their record you are concerned until proven otherwise.
---
You're going to have a rough career in software if this is the way you think about existing code.
---
I've been doing fine, thanks.
---
Omg... please kill Kenny... please kill all of those kiiiidz... put them out of their misery.
---
Also, Chef is amazing.
---
It's part of [this event](https://youtu.be/Hc5tQQ-8r6o), but it looks like the effect didn't despawn properly.
---
Opened 270 envelope with sw+other buffs. If you want gold its better just to simply sell them. (rng seems to be worse than last year) 
---
I don't know if i'm in the majority, but if they made the game run better i would definitely play way way more. I have abysmal performance compared to other games, and because of that i very frequently take breaks because the lag or the low fps annoys the crap out of me. I love the game, definitely my favorite mmo, but i just can't play it for long periods of time because of this.
---
Ahh. Never saw that event. Thanks!
---
Boon duration + 25% movement speed and you get 6 stacks of might. (Instead of 5). And vigor is nice ... i dont need more swiftness .. 
---
Thanks for the link. I did wonder what the point of that area was as nothing seemed to happen there.
---
&gt; The random monster we kill to return from the dead felt pretty random imo.
---
It was actually a bit of a callback to GW1 having a lot of demons who devoured souls, and killing them would release said souls. The notion that the power of the released souls being enough to do an impromptu resurrection spell from ye olde days.
---
Random if you don't recall / never played GW1, but part of established lore.
---
Which version of gw2hook are you running? 
---
Just wish Anet had more foresight when creating GW2.
---
I only needed one block of exp to finish my GoB on my alt acct, so I thought hey lets actually play on a different server, how much different could it be? Answer was very. I normally play on Gandara and have never seen a stream of hatred and profanity from a comm to his followers like this guy on a different server. It made it so unfun I just repaired walls in SM until I finished and immediately left.
---
"Kenny" isn't dead. Inaccurate!
---
The latest, seems to be 1.2.1 atm https://04348.github.io/Gw2Hook/
---
Yep. There are just some fundamental limitations that each game engine has, and GW2 is probably pushing the limits of what its engine can handle. After a point, it just makes more sense to start a new engine from scratch than try to rebuild in place the engine currently being used. 
---
That said, its possible to build a new engine from scratch, then schedule a maintenance where they switch GW2 to the new engine, so we get the benefits of a modern engine without needing a new game. But, if they're putting that much work into it, it almost always makes more sense to release a new game, where they don't have to worry about breaking the current one.
---
Yep! Though, a more recent example of a source game would be Dota 2 or Portal 2
---
Wvw will be discontinued announcement incoming 
---
Let's not forget the spoon, the chisel(I think), and another butter knife, and what I think is a clamp? And so many wrappers I'm surprised we don't see a roach too.
---
One heck of a desk.
---
There's also no real tutorial about it. You just get dumped in there and your first foray is either getting ganked by cheese builds or stampeded by a blob.
---
Holy god, I can see!!!
---
They don't like any criticism of the game. Despite criticism implying that you're a fan wanting to see the game grow better
---
I just want a removal of the limits since it makes no sense.  I agree, it's not a problem in the sense that it doesn't break anything.  I'd say it's also not a problem if no one complains because it's not being done proper.
---
I'm not the only one doing puzzles with mounts or gliding.  By saying "this helps nobody" only discounts that population, as much as putting down your view of doing puzzles for fun.  Removing these limits lets those to enjoy the game with what they've unlocked and how to enjoy it.
---
&gt;  I get the feeling you want more rewards for people who actually do the content, and trivial rewards for those who trivialize it
---
That is **literally** what I'm saying.  It is a compromise for anyone that would argue over it.  Even if ANet doesn't, I just want the limits to be removed because that is what I don't enjoy.
---
Well, even [the commandos themselves](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Unknown_\(NPC\))

Also quite shame that the Asuras stopped being such megalomaniac. In GW 1 they were egomaniac seeing bookahs (when was last time we heard Asura use this term? It was their trademark in first game) as assistants/helpers at most and not much more.
---
On the other hand we have characters like Phlunt being old school Asura and, universally hated bookah.
---
The initial announcement said "several months".
---
Please let it be in the Eternal Alchemy that we get something **substantial**. I've been playing since beta weekend and WvW is what keeps me in Tyria. Yes, I always come back for the new story chapter and new zone, but once that's done then that's it. WvW is what keeps the game social for me. I really hope something big happens for the WvW community.
---
**It's time for WvW to get some love**
---
Plz add more grand master shards in the reward track  , you need 4 seasons of wvw just to buy a single fucking grandmaster mark. 
---
Compare it to pvp each season you can get 3 marks and buy a ascended gear 
---
Ive been dabbling in PvP since Im close to mystic clovers on a few tracks. I honestly dont understand how mirages are considered fine in that game mode. Ok, lets overlook the whole 4 target thing that lacking AoE means youre SoL, at least group play can maybe kind of deal with that. Ok, lets overlook the whole burst you dead in 2-3 seconds, that seems to be a common thing most classes can do in current PvP. But how the hell do they have something like 5-8 seconds of total evasion? Just the other night I managed to survive the burst and got into a duel with a mirage and he managed to evade nonstop for several seconds...all the while nonstop dps'ing me down. I keep reading about how rigged necros are with shroud in PvP, but this point gets almost no attention and is totally fine.
---
I'm sorry, I should've clarified that I think it's being ANNOUNCED now due to these events 
---
6 hour games of invis deadeyes shooting untargetable mirages
---
Then I would agree with you :)
---
It's every 8 path btw, not 10.
---
great vid as always \o/
---
Er what about the alliance system.
---
jesus christ
---
It's 1380 per armor set but you have 3 armor weight so it's 4140 for all armors so 10,290 per dungeon.
---
My only advice on thief, focus mainly on decapping far, hardcapping home (only if needed), and +1ing fights if both are done.
---
WvW players have a right to be cynical and expect the worst. And this is essentially an announcement of an announcement, doing that leads to speculation. Just fucking announce it.
---
It should be noted for those that didn't watch the video that they specifically state that it is not about alliances.
---
One could say it's an out of season April fools joke. 
---
The bomb is actually optional to get the daily.  It's only needed to open the chest at the very end.
---
But, yes, this is a good example of giving folks that want the challenge and those that just want it done.
---
No they will introduce option 6 that we never asked for and then never go back and fix it. 
---
They can not keep on delaying it as they have and then telling us it is for making better and faster content and then this never happen but we wait even longer. 4 episodes last year. That is not way to much waiting time. It was said 2 or at the most 3 months between....
---
Multiple teams reported to be bugged out of the tournament, stuck forever looking for an opponent.
---
Well, no. The egg first appeared in Season 2, easily the first instance that Aurene's importance, as Glint's scion, began. They've been building on it ever since. So yes, 5 years Aurene, even as an egg, has been around.
---
MMORPGs are by definition social and community-based.
---
im so sad that this will probably be it. Its like ANET telling us since a year that they got this "better technology" and next episode is gonna be quicker.. yet EVERY episode is delayed due to some sort of event or whatsoever. I dont even want to touch SAB, i hate it. Time to bridge the time with something else :c
---
You realize the current level pip system is based on title, at 150 you enter bronze, at 620 silver. These have been in place since the wvw rank system was introduced, and the current system just used it as a base. 
---
That said I think you're off base on whether this would actually resolve new player retention. It might affect a small selection of new players but it's unlikely to be the magic button everyone's been looking for. 
---
Or just pick the legendary chest at the log in reward and do PvP or WvW and collect those clovers over the years until you have enough to make 10 legendaries and more piling up for every week.
---
Because they sold smoke instead of what was really going on.
---
Projects are set on stone months in advance, they know what's coming.
---
Right, Anet didn't say anything because people really aren't complaining that they were 5 gold each. They were complaining when they were more than 10 gold each. They've come down in price.
---
It's reasonable for an end game goal at this point. There is a recipe for them, but it's more expensive to craft them than it is to buy them off the TP, so there's little reason to do so. Partly because you need 2 symbols of control for each one and partly because you need 10 ectos and 10 elaborate totems.
---
In my opinion the price is fine for that collection. If you want it, 5 gold is in line with many other end game collection type things.
---
Hahah the sigil price was 15g 3 month ago xd
---
You need 10,290 token for each dungeon: 4,140 for all armor pieces on alll 3 weights and 6,150 for weapon (see [AC dungeon vendor page](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dungeon_Armor_and_Weapons/Ascalonian_Catacombs) as example).
---
That's 82,320 tokens in total. You also get [1 bonus chest of 150 token of your choice](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chest_of_Dungeoneering) every 8 paths (little advice take them into account when you calculate stuff but only open them at the very end).
---
Assuming you start from 0 tokens and 0 skin unlocked and you only do paths that are worth it (ie. you haven't done them in the current repetition of the [Chest of Dungeoneering](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chest_of_Dungeoneering), the tokens you will earn will not be wasted because you already have enough tokens for this dungeon and you haven't done that path today): 8 explorable paths = 800 + 150 = 950 tokens --&gt; 86,65 repetitions of 8 paths (so count 87-88 because even if you get random bonus tokens the Chest of Dungeneering are not granular and will only give you tokens by 150 chunks so they may no match the exact amount needed). So to round it up assume roughly 700 explorable dungeon paths. Daily achiv for doing a dungeon path or random token drops will of course lower that number.
---
If you wanna play with it please find my Dungeneering spreadsheet (with random data for the wallet tokens) [here in Excel format](https://framadrop.org/r/Nh7mLZcqxf#Y38vLnGLIN+LEr/A/gjRHP1GQN4CM1ArmDGiVzrOfos=) or [here in LibreOffice open format](https://framadrop.org/r/z_ho-v7TkM#EhpV9hCuKpgr4ZbC4uLTgupPZt7OpX/8wqJFXnQlYEM=). To use it fill the big collored table of skins you already have (or not) with 1s and 0s (0 = I don't have the skin | 1 I have the skin), fill the yellow line below this big table with the token you already have in you wallet. Add the number of chest of dungeoneering you have on the yeallow cell on the right of the big table and read the number of token you have available, thet you will need and the number of 8-paths runs it corresponds to in green below!

Hope it made sense and it was useful! Good luck on this task!

Feels like a good place to mention that the new map is the worst performing map in the entire game.  It is the *only* map out of the 54 or so that count for world completion where I have to change settings from autodetect to low.  On a quad i5 with a 6gb GTX 1060, SSD, and 16 gigs of RAM.  And even then I can barely get 30fps out of it.
---
Sure, "they won't earn any money on optimization" but if they bloat the product into something that just doesn't run worth a damn regardless of settings then eventually they won't earn any money, regardless.
---
nah; throw it in camps and it will truly kill roaming :p
---
Gw 1 remake?
---
I had no idea how to even play wvw when I went there. I don't think it has to do with rewards, at least initially. Once a player knows how to wvw, THEN I think you are correct about rewards not being the best.
---
&gt;I don\`t think people realize how old most game engines are.
---
Almost as old as Gamebryo feels
---
I'm dead serious. What makes you think their coding skills are below standards?
---
&gt; but in theory this is not forbidden.
---
"In theory" this is totally forbidden. Blocking a key is unattended play and has already been confirmed as such. It's not better than doing the same with software. Your hope to escape detection doesn't make something "not forbidden" be it in theory is practice ... nonsense logic.
---
Which oddly enough is actually one of the newer engine lineages.
---
Both artists did a good job!
---
That sure wasn’t one of “the” tattoo artists of the city.
---
Does it still count though, if we're looking at triple-modified engines? 
---
There should be a line drawn somewhere, otherwise people could start saying stuff as "the MOBA genre started in 1994 because that's when Warcraft came out, which got "modified" into W3, which then got modded into DOTA, which then became its own independent thing."
---
Not sure how to add more photos :S
---
So sad but true
---
well there are map specified reward tracks (they are shown when you hower over a map name.  they are not the same as pvp and wvw and wont reward clovers, but still they are there
---
&gt;The living stories or whatever they are called, I believe once they were done, you could not revisit them for the achievements and such, is this still the case that you cannot go back and redo old content? I've not played in a few years so missed out on a lot.
---
It's a bit of a mix.
---
LW Season 1 finished years ago, and can't be redone. You can only watch a video if it in-game. There is a very good series of videos on YouTube that summarise it. It'll never come back in its original form; if it ever does, which is unlikely, it'd probably be in the form of new instances that re-create the story of S1. This is to do with how it worked; it involved timed events in the open world.
---
After S1, we had S2, and onwards - and these worked a bit differently.
---
While each chapter of seasons S2-S4 were live, you could log in and you would get free access to that chapter. However, if you didn't log in during these times, you instead have to buy the chapter for gems from the in-game store (right now the final chapter of S4 is active).
---
For reference, also, the game goes...
---
Vanilla game personal story &gt; S1 &gt; S2 &gt; Heart of Thorns story &gt; S3 &gt; Path of Fire story &gt; S4 &gt; (believed to be S5)
---
They are still working on the alliance system -&gt; the last [update](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/61986/world-restructuring-update-2)
---
No goals? Now you are prepared for the "real" endgame content. 
---
Max out the masteries, learn your class rotation(git gud^^). Start doing raids + CMs, fractals + CMs.
---
Legendary armors? There u go, long term goal. 
---
Basically, the reason the complaints died down is because the big sigil update came. Now every rune and sigil has a recipe so they're no longer dependent on exotic drops. So now they're pricey, but a reasonable market price based on their crafting costs. 
---
&gt;Performance tanked hard when mounts came out and got even worse when blinged out mount skins showed up.
---
Well, I didn't really noticed, but... If you sa...
---
&gt;get worse FPS in Mistlock than I do in Lion's Arch
---
Oh, in only popular place that have mounts completely disabled. Oh. Okay. Move along.
---
Is that still around? I know they had a hunger games mode at the end of the open beta.
---
The Living World episodes (I assume this is what you are referring to) are free if you logged into your account while they were the current active episode (the period after it's release, before the next episode release, ~2-4 months). If you were not online during that period, you have to buy the episodes for gems.
---
If you DID get the episode (whether purchase or logged in while it was the current one) then you can return to it as much as you'd like for achievements, map currency, or even just for fun. Season 3 and 4 episodes each coincide with a new map too, so you get story content as well as new maps! They are quite a lot of fun. BTW, the portal scrolls from these regions are really helpful if you have multiple characters you use for farming.
---
no, hod for over 5 years, now fc.
---
They insist on sticking to their claim of "every 2-3 months" despite the fact they barely even manage to hit the 3 month mark...
---
Nice cherry pick, cutting off the bit about infusions.  Which are just as big of a resource hit as glowing mount skins.
---
Great, thank you for the reply. I believe I had a lot of gems on my account (about 20,000 if that is enough to buy them?) I'm downloading the game now and just purchased the expansions to dive in.
---
I'd delete the game. Not just my copy. Everyone's copy.
---
...need more info...that pic does nothing to tell us what you got...
---
Programming real-time graphics, shaders and so on, is a very specialized skill set in software development.
---
It's highly likely that arenanet have some people dedicated on building the graphics pipeline, and completely different people are building the game logic.
---
You sum up my wvw experience. I really want to like it as i already failed to like spvp (actually only conquest but THERE IS NOTHING BUT CONQUEST!!!!) but if you are not a roamer and missed commis 20min tour to victory you are just not even getting started.
---
It was 13 gold at one point.
---
The thing is, different people always pay different prices for stuff that's new and then older. I paid more for my legendary to get it faster for example.
---
A new legendary comes out, elder wood prices soar. You need a ton of elder wood logs and bam...you're paying 100 gold or more for that legendary to get it faster.  People who wait pay less. 
---
Same with a lot of things both in game and out. People pay the most to see movies in the theater. I can see the same movie free if I wait long enough.
---
You want it fast, you pay more. You wait, you pay less.  It's always been that way in games.  Even Guild Wars 1 was like that.
---
What a god-tier drop! How much magic find did you have to get this bad boy??? Such an exotic item, please share!
---
I've gone ahead and edited the first bit. You didn't refute anything, you just spouted more bullshit and tried to make it sound like multiboxers don't circumvent anything. If a task is timegated to be performed once per day, a multiboxer (yes by definition has multiple accounts) will be doing said timegated daily activity multiple times.
---
Keep trying to justify it. I hope you get shut down.
---
&gt; Does code 'go bad'?
---
I'm not exactly a programmer myself and it was more of a rhetorical question, but I guess the worst that could happen is that code can become too inefficient because someone popularised a better method of approaching things.
---
You're probably right though, it's almost definitely not worth the effort of reworking it all if it only means that a game's twilight ends up more glorious, assuming the devs are creative enough to pull a decent return out of the new possibilities. 
---
And don't worry, I'm all for reusing existing foundations that have consistently proven themselves in the past. If I'd want almost all features of the Unreal engine but also some new things for my game, it's better to modify it than to try making an "Unreal clone" from scratch and hoping it doesn't perform worse.
---
oh
---
I got that the other day also, [new shoulder skin](https://i.imgur.com/qJB0zt6.jpg) :p

I was opening at around 700% MF but it never happened before I wonder what are the odds of that happening..
---
BR mode in GW2 would be a tiny bit interesting.
---
If she fits, she sits.
---
Depends how "heavily modified".  In the source engines case, they definitely still aren't stuck on DX9 rendering with very little multi threading like GW2 is.   
---
Anyone with multiple accounts can do that though. Your pulling multiboxing into an argument that has nothing to do with it. It’s a strawman argument. 
---
What exactly are we circumventing? The only unique thing LB does is remove the mutex, something that can be removed in plenty of ways, is not against the TOS, and is literally a convenience thing for 99.9% of players. 
---
There is a big WvW patch coming out Tuesday, perhaps this might be it?!

Chak Egg Sac doesn't drop from unid gear or any bag tho

Playing multiple accounts and funneling funds into one account should also be bannable, thank you for agreeing with me there.

Simply put, you are enabling them. You are just as bad if not worse by enabling, even if you're not personally abusing. Goodbye.
