The layoffs were not up to Areananet. It came from the top so he was let go and his rehiring likely came with some stipulations.

I'd love to hear more how Cameron was able to come back but it is all speculation at this point.
---
---
---
Bummer, exactly what I wanted to do.
---
Not to burst you bubble but even if Josh comes back and I'd love that his jumping puzzles rocked. That doesn't necessarily mean SAB will get new worlds or we will get more jumping puzzle don't get me wrong I hope everyone who left comes back.
---
You can actually skip the tutorial, but I was hoping for a solo method instead of TTF.

Welcome back agent, it has been a while! Did you remember to bring the apple cider?

Ot never relied on the meta as much as it has since PoF. You could still run different builds with great success and a 15 man group could take on a 40 man group much more easily. Now it's  whomever has more PewPew BoomBoom with sustain.

Josh took voluntary severance how can he come back.

Josh took voluntary severance

Most WvW zerg groups are going to run builds close to the ones on [Vabbi](http://builds.vabbi.org/) (you can check with your commander or server to see if they have variants that they prefer. 
---
All your characters were given a WvW [sample reset](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sample_Ability_Reset_Guide) to buy for 0 shards (additional resets are only 25) so you can reset any character. I'd also suggest looking at a skill guide like the [one on metabattle](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guide:WvW_Mastery_Points) to see what you should be focusing on (I'd suggest getting the first 4 ranks in warclaw but not the 5th or 6th until much later). Metabattle also goes into [more detail on non-zerg builds](https://metabattle.com/wiki/WvW) if you want to look at other options.
---
At least on the server's I've been on there isn't any consistency in tag colors besides commanders trying not to have the same and picking what they like.
---
Oh no...Well i'm gladd he already found work at least
---
A core class, at least 1 per party.
---
 Why would there be new elite specs? Unless your planning on waiting 2 or 3 years 
---
I know Ben took voluntary severance, but where you saw that Josh too it too ?

My biggest issue is when posts say the game is dying, then give some complaints and criticisms, are still downvoted to hell. Can we not discuss?

I don't think you really need to grow up, so much as figure out a way to carve your own safe place (and I don't say this ironically) in the world. You sound like a very empathetic person, and some folks find this more difficult than others. 
---
Overcoming the inertia is a real bitch, though waiting for the strength to do so is backwards; you just kind of have to take a few steps anyway even if it all feels like pointless bullshit.
---
I like your mentions of boxing and martial arts and think you should get back into them, as they are separate from all of the world's problems right now. If you can't control the world, you can at least control your body, your breathing, and your own strength.
---
I enjoy WvW and the game doesn't feel dead. It's pretty quiet at some hours early in the morning, but it always has been between expansions and etc-- that's also been the case on WoW, AION, GW1, etc.
---
Nothing wrong with spending time in both worlds. I’m not gonna tell you what to think, but if you find nothing but sadness in your current outlook it might help to sprinkle in some positivity.
---
Making money doesn’t have to be evil. It’s a necessity. It’s how you’re able to play video games with a roof above your head. The alternative is to be homeless and starving, and trust me, that’s worse than feeling like a soulless cog in a machine.
---
Strive for a better life in any way you can and know that not everything is bleak and hopeless. You do have to make an effort in changing the way you think, and I know that’s hard. Find people to talk to. Use the energy gained by video games in striving for a better future. 
---
It was my first big zerg boss fight in gendarran fields and i remember just doing a heart tending the farm outside of the entrance of LA. This massive blob just running and i was awestruck. Hopped on the zerg and killed the boss. 2 days later i purchased HoT.
---
I'm happy if Cameron is happy.
---
But I really worry this might signal Anet is open to "seasonal layoffs" in NCSoft's eyes. I can't imagine negotiating severance and a rehire package was that much cheaper than just renegotiating pay and keeping Cameron for those ~10 days.
---
They're really difficult to match with other things, though; people use no-effort gemstone skins because they look great.
---
Really I'm asking for more of the armor sets you got out of HoT (bladed looks cool) and PoF (warbeast looks very cool, and I often get asked what that set is when I wear it, get compliments etc), along with the upgradable set they released (I don't like the cloth version but got the basic set anyway). The griffon quest (sans gold) was a good way to get a new mount, what about similar stuff for skins? Maybe do more world bosses that drop really nice mount or weapon skins?
---
There's a lot of way that games have implemented good carrots. 
---
I wish you all the best and hope you find a Kidney soon.
---
Has to happen eventually, no? Unless the game gets shut down.
---
Your point made it sound like it's never happening.
---
I guarantee you that you are the only one who cares about your code enough to steal it - ergo, no one will "steal" it. But, you do you. Good to hear you'll eventually open it up.
---
Wow, really. I'm dumbo, ty.
---
No, not yet, completely new. I've just been getting annoyed that I can't use certain features, mostly the TP and character slots since I want to explore more professions without having to delete the character each time. 
---
Thank you ~
---
Well, I suppose that if you drop exotics now and then from the chests and such that they pay themselves off a bit quicker, but the basic nodes are definitely something you can do to help your friends. :)
---
is there a limit to how much rank points you can farm from custom arena win trading daily rooms? (trying to get to rank 100 so i can buy those fancy mistforged glorious armor as soon as possible)
---
If you wait for a 50% off sale you can buy both!
---
Yeah that's what I meant by daily log ins. I thought I might as well buy the expansion pack now rather than after getting level 80 so it can start gathering up. Especially since I'm slow. 
---
I don't think I'm going to go into the expansion content any time soon so I'm purely buying the packs to unlock some features. My question is, can I get a mount before reaching level 80 if I choose to buy PoF? 
---
If you're on a US server, I can help you get a mount. You either have to do the level 80 story or join someone else that has already done it. I have a character called New Player Helper and I help new and returning players get stuff like mounts early. You'll have a basic raptor...it's pretty cool. Doesn't take long. Hit me up here or in game if you want some help getting it, without using your level 80 boost.
---

---
I mean, you say that but there's been incidents in the past where my code and/or ideas were stolen or reused and advertised as their own.
---
what an excellent idea...THANKS!!!
---
Dude thats fuckin awesome bro. Thanks for sharing!
---
It really is strange that you're born into a world where you have no choice but to run the hamster wheel to make enough money to survive, and there's really just no other option; but that is what it is.

[this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Rune_of_the_Holosmith) might be worth looking into if you're into frontlining, assuming its identical to the holosmith skill (which im doubtful of, but also dont know for sure) then thats a potential 12x5 tags
---
I activated the skills in the order in the title, I think. I kept taking screenshots and this came out. [Here are some other results.](https://imgur.com/gallery/1yt5F8H) I lightly edited the colors and the exposure in this picture, because in-game I have the Gamma a bit higher to see properly. The only effect I added to the picture is the game logo, everything else is in-game skill effects.  
---
Now I'm thinking about how my other characters would look. For example my Elementalist standing in a Meteor Shower right above a Lava Font throwing a Fireball. Or my Scourge walking towards the camera from the clouds of Sand Shades with the effects of the Desert Shroud in maybe a Dry Top Sandstorm.
---
It wouldn't change. Being able to move faster doesn't change the distance between locations; the human story will *still* be more densely packed than the others. We can just do them all a little faster now.
---
Mhhh, wonder what he will do there. What did he do exactly? Because in my head I always read his flair as a level designer (which doesn't really seem applicable to a game like minecraft)
---
Well I completely understand people being concerned if the program is malicous or anything, but there's no other way but they either blindly trust some random person on the internet, or the program is open-source, I reckon.
---
I want to build upon this program and improve it. I am not a software engineer, I am someone who taught himself programming and wanted to improve his experience with the game.
---
Releasing the sourcecode and possibly having people make copies of this program is not my goal, my goal is to make the best out of this as possible and support as much wishes the people have. For example multiboxing.
---
I am aware that there's some other programs out there, but none really meets my expectations. This is not launchbuddy, or some other tool. This is Guild Lounge.
---
The same way anyone gets a new job -- by applying and getting hired.
---
Taking voluntary severance doesn't somehow magically bar you from ever working for the company again.
---
That being said, as I said. I will take the "risk" of people stealing my code. And eventually release it open-source.
---
When, you ask? Some time soon, as I said I am not a professional, therefore I'd much rather clean this "mess" up as far as possible, so we can improve it together, if people like to help me and other people can use this safely without any concerns.
---
I'm at work atm, what are the instabilities?
---
Also, Guild Lounge doesn't have access to your credentials either, it probably has exactly as much access as launchbuddy does, if I understand how it works. I actually never really looked into it.

Oh God no, that sounds like an absolute nightmare for something that's insta-kill if you fall. I know some people find that sort of thing fun and that's cool, but maybe that's not what's fun to OP. It doesn't necessarily mean there's a lack of creativity or a need to think outside the box, etc.
---
Compare that to Character slots which gives you TWO spaces for crafting licenses, at least 5 more bag slots, an additional farming character, and another birthday reward. Honestly, there's just no reason to get Crafting Licenses. Anet should have put the licenses on sale before character slots if they wanted to sell any significant amount. 
---
Say it with me: D E L E T E  D E E P S T O N E
---
Really, these home instances nodes is just an additional way to say "I'm rich, you know" and invite friends in to gather. Granted, I respect people who do that because it brings people together to chat but I digress. 
---
I genuinely like Deepstone, it's the closest we've gotten to an old-school dungeon. Two-way branching paths which you can approach differently, and an interesting mechanic that isn't just another AOE to dodge. This video is more an issue with Slippery Slope than with the fractal itself. 
---
Yea but the last panel also strikes alot of resemblance to All or Nothing's ending.
---
At high level open world becomes unrestricted PVP, meaning no matter what you'll be slain by people who has BDO as a full time job or work only to play this game.
---
Have you tried getting neetbux?
---
Also, arcdps especially, is known that it accesses the RAM, it could do something illegal and then your account is permanently banned, instead of stolen which apparently is your concern. (which can be retrieved, and might not even get stolen in the first place because of 2-factor and also because of new IP login)
---
There are definitely more fights now, even on the desert border lands, its quite fun. 
---
Long and tedious is more or less what defines the dungeon experience and finding ways to shortening that time with a coordinated team. 
---
- then a long room with no ability to speed it up.
---
You're wrong here. If you want a faster run, you can split the two among the two paths. For the center path, you can use perma alacrity to decrease the recharge of the Special Action key and if you coordinate what order press the special action key, it goes by *really* fast. 
---
The elevator is simply pull mobs then burst them. The last boss is like all other bosses, dps faster but it teleports.
---
The only thing I can agree with you is the Keep away phase with the last boss.
---
I think being able to use the special action in the air would solve that issue.
---
The problem with WvW is that it's not 24/7 and the outcome never matters.
---
Also if devs put in more content like new structures, siege machines, new buildings etc. would make things more spicy and interesting in the long run. 
---
No, I'd say it's the opposite.
---
Most of us are very aware that the game has flaws. There are tons of posts on this subreddit about them all the time. We discuss them here all the time, even though a select group of folks act like we don't. Many of the front page posts are criticisms on any given day.
---
The problem is there's a difference between "discussing flaws" and just straight-up negativity. These things *can* be balanced, and absolutely *should* be balanced, because excessive negativity does nothing except hasten the death of the game we love. I have plenty of time to talk about flaws and what should/could be done about them... I have no time to talk about how terrible, awful, etc. this game is, or how it's "dying". That kind of talk does nothing. It's the difference between constructive criticism and just being a dick.
---
And, in this case, I definitely am not interested in coddling someone who 1. wants us to restate the obvious (that is, that there's no new exciting news, which he has no excuse not to know because he's looking at the same subreddit that we are) and 2. isn't capable of figuring out what he wants to play based on his own criteria and wants us to somehow make a personal decision for him. It's especially grating here because OP has clearly already made their decision -- they've already stated that liking the game isn't enough to make them want to play, and they won't stay without something new happening. Why even ask us when the answer is glaringly obvious... unless they just really enjoy slapping GW2 in the face on their way out the door?
---
I hope everyone plays whatever they enjoy -- whether that be GW2 or something else -- but I'm not going to do someone's basic thinking *for* them.
---
Don't feel bad. I had to zoom in to tell that this wasn't artwork, but an actual screenshot. 
---
Did it take many tries to get the timing and angle down?
---
They will start talking sooner or later. 
---
....this is anet MO you are talking about right????
---
This fsme might have 2 or 3 or even 13 more years ahead, it's really not something that we have knowledge to foresee. For most Gw2 players there's only one game that can kill Gw2, and that's gw3 if it will ever come (not soon). 
---
how so? i think it's fine where it needs to be but of course it can always be better. can you elaborate what part of glamour you don't like?
---
I don't have answers but I have a point to add, 
---

---
If you can afford it, I’d recommend going for both, as you’re likely to grab them eventually, and can save some money getting them together. If you’re a story completion it’s, I’d strongly recommend setting some money aside for all of the Living World episodes as well (seasons 2 &amp; 3 both offer discounted bundles). Really major story beats happen during them, and they aren’t really summed up well in the expansions. 
---
how do people know what wvw rank you are? the other day i was playing wvw, in squad chat i was making scarcastic comments trying to sound like a new wvw player. this other guy made a reply "you are at rank 729 and still don't know these basic stuff?" How did he know what my rank is?
---
I think Human commoner has the quickest skips. If you're lucky you can totally skip the tutorial, run right up to Ted, run straight to Jake, you can kill some bandits in the orphanage before it opens and run to the hospital before the dialogue is finished, and the last mission is a walk to a single fight.
---
[Here’s the full list of all bags you’ll want to open on your lv 49-53 char](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Champion_bag)

---
I dunno - I can't see it with all the glare.
---
Hmm seriously though, Anet removing perma Stability pulsing from elite spirit hurts fractals so much. There's an excessive amount of daze going on that keeps cancelling rotations, esp in the dredge fractals. So not fun. 
---
That being said, today's Mai Trin might not be so bad with reflects and pulls. Just gotta cleave the mobs ASAP. I'd imagine Epidemic will work wonders too, plus necros can bring Poison Cloud to destroy fire projectiles occasionally. 
---
I mean, yeah. I'd rather work the hamster wheel earning money for a living than have to wander around homeless having to forage and scavenge for food. That was kind of my point.
---
I don't see why a working for a paycheck isn't productive and doesn't provide you with the feeling of providing for you and yours.

I'm the type of person who's pretty straightforward, I get easily bored doing a lot of pointless busywork. I think it's fair for people who are better able to handle officework or retail or whatever, and are happy with that, to say that they should definitely stick with it. 
---
I mean you could say that art is pointless busywork but I like doing it, so it's ok for me, especially since now I'm disabled and a lot of regular jobs would be a challenge (I can't sit up for too long because I broke my spine in three places years ago). My sweetie is also a freelance artist (also disabled) and a 9 to 5 job never suited him either, we're kind of used to a more freewheeling up and down existence.

Those are bind on equip, not craft.

Adventures are a pretty good idea.

Sorry for my ignorance.. what are adventures? Is it just the story journal?

i whoud put some interesting boss into this room,instead of retarded  *puzzle* which was borring by the 3rd time.
---
Yep, I get people their mount all the time. Just have someone else enter the story, while you're in LA with them. Then make sure you get a bit of credit on the heart in the story. Talk to the heart NPC and you can buy the mount for 0 karma.

Can't DPS blast it in 5 minutes. Thats the general complaint. I personally miss the Dungeons and how they used to melt your face off
---
It's more about having the most skips in the story.
---
Eg. in the tutorial you can cut across the farm straight to the earth elemental boss, skipping the walk to the garrison and the whole centaur killing step.
---
In the inn you can blink/shadowstep up to the 2nd floor.
---
In the cave to grab the medicine you can skip everything except Twitchy Jake and his bodyguard.
---
Human commoner can be done in 12 minutes, so I'll have to try this one to see if it's actually any better.
---
Mo-ther-fu-$\*$&amp;! I hate that green halo effect with a passion. I have thousands of screen shots from over the years of various random crap. I would adjust my positioning so I wouldn't have something/someone in the center of the screen because of it. Now you tell me this wonder piece of news which I love you for and hate you for at the same time. Now I can take non-outlined shots which I love you for. I hate you because now I have to go back and redo some of my shots. Granted, I am redoing my screenshots now that I have a GTX 1060 and a 4K screen. Not the best but way nicer than my old Full HD GTX 950 shots. Seriously, thank you!
---
I will repeat what I said because you are really confused about ganking in GW2. If you die in a zerg, start running back and find a roamer that is not a 'gank' even if you don't want to fight that 1v1. If you start running away then you are at fault, still not ganking. If you die because you suck or weren't running right build it STILL isn't ganking. Amazingly enough roaming isn't just telling the tag a zerg is at bay because you were nearby and taking camps, you actually want to kill people and if you see people you kill them. Ganking on the other hand is simply put as running around in a group of 5 and killing one dude or 4 or even just coming into a 1v1 and killing the other dude. Also you talk about 'denying players the game' when mounts literally do that to solo roamers omegalul. You may have had an idea about what a ganker was but just because people are better than you or better geared than you blah blah blah it doesn't mean they are a ganker, gankers are dicks.
---
You could also find a code for the base game online for relatively cheap, if your goal is just to remove the restrictions.
---
&gt; Monthlies were a driving factor for the game's overall social experience, and nothing replaced that once they were gone.
---
I mean I guess they could come back, but you wouldn't get the rewards from them besides AP at the most.
---
&gt; Remember how the Custom Arena was a gem store item before it became a gold item?
---
Yeah and it was worse like that.  At least at 2g per day it was better than getting them through keys.
---
&gt; If you're in WvW for the achievements alone, the faster you're done and leave the better.
---
Yet the longer they stay the higher the population in WvW.  So again why make achievements easier to get?
---
&gt; Just remove it altogether instead of looking for specific conditions, which will eventually lead to more problems anyway.
---
The moment the mail restrictions would get removed is the moment you get spam mailed from gold sellers.  Having a minor requirement of having 2 people adding each other to friends to bypass the mail limit is reasonable.  Having the 2 mail limit by default for people not friends with one another is acceptable.
---
Perhaps it is the game. I just started playing gw2 after a long time and had this problem before so I have no idea what causes it.
---
Yeah but they only lasts a few seconds and have long cd. It's not that fractals are nice enough to reduce cd accordingly. 
---
In the past few days my experience went like this: "I'm about to start my burst! Eat thiii... Dazed into cd, ok." "Ok CC phase incoming, gonna break this son of a... Nope, interrupted." Bloody stinks. 
---
Maybe everyone should just play Guardian and rotate casting "Stand Your Ground" &gt;_&gt;
---
No sir no more gamblerino, i have learned My lesson the hard way, it sucks after grinding for that long and do something that stupid.
---
I remember seeing this a few months back.. but everyone on the map could see it as well.. so not sure what went on there.  I think WvW was shut down a few mins later and servers got an update lol

I'd wait for a 50% off instead and get both for $25. But if you really need to buy one now I'd say HoT. PoF mostly is for the mounts with content that has bad replayability.

Reddit and arm chair psychologists, name a more iconic duo
---
There is a Mod that makes GW2 use DirectX12 instead of 9. Judging by the users, you can get a plus of 15 to 20 FPS using that.
---
Yeah. I think you described it very succinctly there.
---
In terms of quality and thematic content, it feels like its targeted towards young adults. And I think that young adult fiction isn't necessarily bad. It can be pretty interesting, deep, and involved.
---
It just happens that GW2 isn't. And again, I don't think this is the fault of the writers so much as it is the medium and the approach they've taken with the story.
---
It's much easier to write a single rich narrative and keep a high level of quality than it is to write multiple narratives with less depth.
---
Well..cool story but I think any kind of "begging" is forbidden here. Check subreddit rules here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules

Ok, here another teaching of Ventari. Gold is like a River, it will flow into your Pockets at a steady rate, but if you try to push it, it will feel like you don't make any at all.

Is it so hard to do the mechanics?

&gt;Rush? I started off with the basic install and tweaked it then. Didn't see actual performance change in any cases other than crashing the GPU driver. Both suffered like it was loading the textures directly from the ssd, hell, with that speed it might as well be an hdd. Tried clean install and it was the same. DX12, other than pretty shiny, is mostly about letting games use more threads correct? Yet it feels like its not. The GPU is hardly getting any work and most of the CPU cores are idling. I would record it with riva stats to examine it more but for some reason the recording software just wont capture the game in this mode either.
---
Its really shocking to me how many players you meet in t4 fractals that have no clue how to counter the new instabilities. Like RP walk for difficult passages and as few movement skill pressing as possible on slippery. Reflect for firebleed instab, cleave for birds.
---
Sorry, thats kinda off-topic, but you can raid in exotic gear. Only on condition builds its really inconvenient, because getting exotic viper pieces is already quite expensive. But support and power dps? Its quite okay to slowly gear those with drops you then get from raids. For support you can buy harrier weapons for what... 2g each? Then use water runes with magi or cleric or givers exotic armor (givers only for tank variants), whatever healing stat trinkets with platinum doubloons. For power dps just go for berserker with spellbreaker runes. Ive been raiding with that on my alt-accounts for ages, it works perfectly fine.
---
So, if your friends arent getting their gear fast enough for your taste, just ig mail it to them ;) 
---
And to those downvoting a perfectly relevant post:
---
Reddit isnt facebook, stop treating the downvote function like a dislike button. Or do you have ICD?

---
Excuse me but... what is the purpose of your post exactly ?
---
You like the game  but you have no reason to play it because no future announcements ? Well, I'm a wow player since the beginning, and I can tell you that, even with the certitude of future patches and futures xpac, the game is not interesting enough right now to play it imo.
---
Your whole post looks like a hidden "the game has 0 future, it's doomed". If you were really liking it no question asked, you would not even post something here.

I spent a lot of time in real life. But I found it was pay to win, and it was very grindy.  Three wlves, multiple jobs later, I'm retired. Funny thing is, I've lived what many would consider a full life, but I've spent way too much time working and not enough time enjoying. I don't think anyone has ever gone to the grave wishing they'd spend more time at the office.
---
Funny bit is, I count my real life friends not very differently from my online friends.
---
I met some of my friend who are now real life friends online. I might my wife online. Online isn't not real life. It's another means to connect with people I might never have connected with otherwise.
---
I grew up at a time when being a nerd wasn't an advantage. It was looked down upon. You were the weirdo, not the hero. And in order to find other nerds, I had to roam further afield. 
---
Because what is real life besides someone else's checklist of what real life should be?  Is having a relationship real life? I don't know. I think some single people are quite happy. Is having a good job real life? I don't know, I know a lot of people with good jobs who are miserable? Is having lots of friends real life? No idea. I have quite a few friends, but only a few I really feel I can depend on in a lurch.
---
At the end of the day, I've done my time, I'm retired now, but I wouldn't say that you're wasting your time playing games, any more than I'd say I wasted my time working my ass off. They're both valid experiences, as long as you learn from them.
---
This philosophical break has been brought to you by too much coffee. Thank you.
---
Fractals are back on the menu in full swing bois **\\\[T\]/**
---
But first, let's get that new raid out 
---
If you would've learned your lesson you woulnd't be here begging for gold. I seriously hope you don't get a single mail but sadly I'm sure there are people stupid enough to send you money.
---
What change made medic engi so good? What do they do well? Teach me senpai
---
Thanks it's not easy to find music without copyright I like it .
---
I had a lot of fun making the video.
---
Its m'y first time with sab decorations.
---
I've already done a maze and skimmer race in the guild hall. 
---
Off course but not today 🙃 
---
Send me a message and we'll arrange it.
---
Thank you I've only been making videos for 3 months and I love it.
---
there are 4 meta things . I will not be talking about meta events so that drops. There is a meta builds wich we all know . Meta ability wich is ever changing thing. You can see it especialy after a patch when they will change a class somehow. Then beta builds might change. This change or adaptation is the meta ability. And then there are meta players. You can have meta build on you but that doesnt make you a meta player . These players might or might not use meta builds, thats up to them. But you can tell them apart from the rest by this meta ability change and adapt. If your team needs a class then they will change for it. Your team needs a healer then they can change into healer and heal you. They have always open mind. Me as meta player ? No .. no way. Im not able to play condi builds so I can never be meta player. Im meta healer maybe because I focus my attention into healing others but meta player ? Sadly not =( 
---
If that helps, I have 5k hours into this game, I too have done everything possible. The biggest problem for me in gw2 has always been the lack of endgame gear progression. I get the idea of having ascended gear as the cap to make the game more suited for casual players and I kinda approve it, but then you need other things to keep players active
---
I don't do fractals but my guess is: you take an exam and someone keeps on throwing stuff at your back and makes animal noises. Just because he is annoying and you cannot concentrate doesn't mean the exam itself is difficult.
---
I hate that unblockable attack with a vengeance
---
I had this similar idea where they just break down like that. It's a no brainer at this point that something will remain broken after everything is done. Either the commander or the world, or if you're sadistic, everything.
---
lvl 2
---
https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers/
---
Anet designers confused challenging with annoying. Instabilities should be fractal/boss exclusive, not global. Global instabilities end up being a mess where some instabs and their combinations can be cancer in some fractals, while irrelevant in other. This is design opposite to fun.
---
&gt; I had to zoom in to tell that this wasn't artwork, but an actual screenshot. 
---
Well, many effects use flat semi-transparent colour/texture splashes rotated towards the "camera", or low-res 3D models, so no wonder.
---
So basically this so called "meta ability" is just the willingness to adapt to new stuff.
---
That paragraph is a huge bundle of nonsense. 
---
Yet you need to complete the exam or quit. By yelling and crying on that person behind you will change nothing. 
---
He seemed more neutral happy in gw1.
---
You can visit that? Last time I saw that I was with Zhed Shadowhoof the centaur.
---
You have problems with them ? Take a range weapon and slide around. Keep shooting and you will make it. The only reason why you are upset is that you have meta build with only close combat weapons ? But its just my guess. 
---
before and after plastic surgery
---
Huh. I don't think that you were defending the lord, so why are you complaining?
---
 &gt; willingness to adapt to new stuff.
---
Not exactly but you were close. This alibity is always there. When patch will come out and meta builds will change. They are using and always will be using this meta ability. For you as player you can have the ability or not. If you will decide not to adapt then you simply dont have the ability in that moment. 
---
With a laptop any high graphical intensity games throttle your system performance output to limit battery usage.
---
For example you will either get 10 fps on default mode for 4 hours, or 40 fps on performance mode for an hour...
---
Yeah, the battery drains like a motherfucker if you let a high end gaming laptop perform at maximum output on battery.
---
You really need to plug it in to a wall socket if you want to play a game like GW2 which has shit optimisation. 
---
Daying over and over in raids before we fould a way to kill the boss also wasnt fun. Training your class so you would be playing well also wasnt fun. We are not talking about the whole game but only part of it. If you want to have fun and not be dealing with it then simply dont go there. Stop playing Fotm and enjoy the game. Nobody is forcing you to do Fotm at all. Its your decision and yours alone. 
---
This feature already exists in the newer episodes. Sadly, it is still a problem for the older ones and I don't think that they will go back to fix them.
---
A player ritualist not using signet of spirits is a rare sight indeed. 
---
My question is... why we can't have simply bosses with more/better mechanics instead of annoying instabilities...
---
But wheres the difference between having to bring a chrono and druid before, and now bringing chrono+healfb? I really dont get it. GW2 is already flexible in terms of comps for endcontent. The fact that you have 3 open dps slots and one semi open slot in a 5 man group... thats not bad. And it has been like that for years now.
---
Pugs, imo, should go for most convenient comps - always. Currently, Id say thats chrono+healfb or chrono+healalacrigade. Both bring might, regen and protection, healing. Firebrand brings additionally aegis+stability and more fury, another pull and more condi clear. Alacrigade brings kalla elite life leech, some additional vulnerability, aoe daze for trash mobs, big cc and okay condi clear.
---
If you want convenient and easy fractals you need a certain "toolkit". CC, condi clear, a pull, boonrip every 20(?) seconds , some stability, some aegis, 25 might, about 40% fury, 100% protection, 1 healer, maybe someone with port for skips.
---
New instabs only added some reflect on fire instab, and I wouldnt say thats necessary with healer, only very convenient.
---
Thing is, new instabs got introduced with a massive nerf to chaos chrono. Chaos chrono before was able to take care of 8 out of those 11 things. Druid only added 25 might, fury and healing to that.
---
In short: instabs arent the reason for the increased difficulty and less efficiency of druid in t4 fractals. Chaos chrono nerf is the reason. However, anet made that design decision, so now we have to adapt *shrug*. I enjoyed playing chaos chrono, but if anet doesnt want a high-utility buffer spec and instead want it more spread out... thats fine. Its their game, I just play it now and then ;)
---
As for dazes, I can only really agree with chaos boss being excessive. Mai trin aoes dont daze you, I think you mean her teleport shot, Im a bit confused about what you could mean with dazes on Mai Trin fight. Aetherblades you can interrupt the daze, so I dont really see them as a problem at all, but sure, without a pull and shield5 directly after... or daze summons from alacrigade they can be a pest. Dredges same. Sirens Reef you can sidestep the cone attack, it has a quite long windup animation AND aoe indicator.
---
You dont need perma stability. Its just convenient for players that cant or wont time their skills correctly, sorry to say.
---
\~10 seconds...
---
Thats a nice assumption to make... I let it sit for a while, getting food, emptying washing machine. Didnt time it but since every second object just flickers even after loading properly its really not easy to tell if its actually loaded.
---
It looks like they're in the "find the path" room. You respawn in it by being dropped from relatively small height onto "lit" part of the platform near the glowy ball.
---
Unfortunately geniuses from development apply slippery slope to that area and _any_ movement that is not immediately followed by a dodge would result in sliding. Platform is tiny, you get dropped basically one square away from falling over. Immediately slide to the side (you have some momentum at this point), slip off, fall to death. Repeat.
---
It's like fractal devs on principle can't think beyond plain T1 fractal about "what will happen when your freshly invented bullshit instability will be applied to your newly added fractals". (see birds + siren's reef+squishy pugs, social awkwardness in some places were you literally end up with not enough space for all people etc)
---
May all of their real life walkways be 100% slippery. Because their life is certainly boring and has not enough bullshit variety.

---
Missing the dll... Thanks
---
You can see all mastery points in achievement menu.
---
By newer do you mean the living story episodes after PoF?
---
Monster hunter is easy game. You will get everything so easily. Game for few weeks max. Gw2 takes so much longer. My first legendary took me 2 years. It takes time and skills. It will take time and skills for you to adapt as well. Yes it might not be immediately and fun but I do belive that one day you will be able to overcome it
---
For some yes. For me its challange to heal my friends and it doesnt mater where or what they are doing. Instabilites are not challange in my oppinion because I still need to watch out only for my team. Another item on my list I need to watch out for. 
---
Well yeah, because they don't care about balancing them or even testing before implementation.
---
And some maps do have one extra mastery if you get bronze in all of the adventures of that specific map.
---
Yeaj I mean, I get it, but that way of thinking is what is throwing MMOs to the trash. People forget that it's a game and you are supposed to look for fun no to win even with boring tactics. I miss the ages when people would duel for hours in MMOs just for fun.
---
It's not a progression. It's old content, it won't change just because you slap an ogre farting in your face while you fight same boss you've killed hundreds times already. Is farting ogre a challenge? Hardly. Is it annoying? Definitely.
---
[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Rank_farming](yeah)
---
You don't get it.
---
I currently play Gw1 again.
---
Im super lazy and let my Heros kill everything while i stay back and heal.
---
If you want a bugged toon, okay
---
Tybalt, recap!
---
Yes, commander.
---
Welcome back Agent. While you have been gone the Order has been keeping note of [things you should know](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/wiki/returningplayers). They are also having questioning sessions every [Saturday at 1pm UTC](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1pm+UTC+Saturday)
---
If you would like to catch up on the adventures the Order library has you covered: 
---
* [Season one](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Living_World_Season_1)
---
* [Season two](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Living_World_Season_2)
---
* [Season three](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Living_World_Season_3)
---
I got my last few from adventures (usually worth one or two each), strongboxes and a bit of raiding.
---
i am not entertain
---
Imagine GW2 having a system akin to FF14. That entails, that: 
---
* you would have to go to your home instance and interact with a glamour station every time you want to change templates
---
* you may only swap between the templats you already have set up
---
* you have to pay a transmutation charge every time you want to unlock a skin (even if you are not going to use it)
---
* you are only alowed to save a fraction of your skins
---
* you will have to remove skins from your wardrobe if you want them replaced (wasted transmutation charge and time)
---
* you can't really change your looks on the fly and alter it as you are limited to the templates
---
* you may only save a certain number of templates
---
How is this fine?
---
I checked out the malchors leap elder wood nodes and there is only 4 where everyone leaves their characters. I got 16 elder wood... Is this rally worth the time and effort? I have a ton of alts I keep at jp and tomb. Am I missing something? Is part of the farm at another wp? Doesn't seem worth it. 
---
That it is still very, very similar to how the nerfing of Icecrown Citadel in WoW was handled and because there wasn't a power reset afterwards, it led to complaints regarding the change in player power in Ruby Sanctum. It is worth checking how much the general raiding playerbase dislikes things such as this.
---
It is why nerfs to content in WoW, particularly towards the end of an expansion, are now done to the mobs and bosses themselves and not through increasing player power artificially.
---
Oh okay, will it affect me if im not from europe
---
I didn't say it wouldn't make sense. I said it will probably never happen, because they don't revisit old content very often and there is a ton of instances to fix.
---
I think the community prides itself on how newbie-friendly it is, but there is quite a lot of assumed knowledge that people talk about without explaining, like recommending viper's or harrier's gear without mentioning that they are both very time-consuming to obtain. I think us 'veteran' players forget how impenetrable the game can be if you don't know what you're doing. 
---
I really recommend looking for an active guild - r/guildrecruitment is very decent. Having a friendly, active guild adds so much to the game. 
---
I'd start the Heart of Thorns story just to open the maps up (be aware they are harder than the main game, but if you're okay in the Silverwastes you should be fine).
---
The Heart of Thorns maps are still among the most popular due to the well-designed events and relatively high rewards. The four HoT zones will almost always be busy, but can be a pain to navigate until you've opened up the waypoints. Verdant Brink has a focus on helping outposts then a bossfight run at the end. Auric Basin has a series of (12?) event chains that ends in a coordinated assault in the middle after a little minigame break. Tangled Depths is like a combination of the two with local events and then a push down several paths. Dragon's Stand has the best meta in the game, in my opinion, with three lanes of players making a coordinated assault and one of the most unique final stages in the game. 
---
It's often overlooked online, but I find that the Orr maps are always fairly active and have some of the best meta events of the base game. For medium-sized activities, look for a commander or mentor tag in Orr and follow along.
---
The LFG often advertises World Boss trains/taxis as well as the HoT meta events. Verdant Brink is sort of the exception as often only the final bosses are advertised due to how spread out it is (sort of like Silverwastes but each outpost has its own narrative). They often advertise which 'lane' they are *e.g. "Chak", "north" or "mid") but follow the mass of dots on your map and you'll get to the right place.
---
You have those open at the same time? That 1 CPU core both of these games use must be in agony
---
It's not about challenging which in my opinion only 99 CM and 100 CM are. Its about doing the same fractals for years (in my case since release) but now wasting more of time because of retarded instabilities that are annoying like birds, SS, etc. I do everyday the full run Cm's + T4 + Recs and even if I have no problem doing it and instabilities don't affect me that hard like other people, they are just annoyance to the same fractal that I have done for all the years, which means that is the same but as I said wasting more time. 
---
This is my point, but well I don't get bother by it so much because I usually play with *"skilled"* people, but I have and alt account where I do fractals sometimes in the usual "T4 dailies" and the cancer you can get doing some fractals with a bad combo of instabilities with people that are not that smart its really annoying. 
---
The nodes reset every 2h (AFAIK) so farming them multiple times a day is more profitable than JPs
---
Am I the only one looking at the meny buttons in the bottom left corner of the GW1 picture and feel an itch to get them alligned? :D
---
Keys are not region locked.
---
I sincerely hope you don't go outside mass killing animals because something a video game made you angry
---
If you believe making a legendary takes skill I feel like our perception of difficulty is a lot different.
---
I wouldnt mind at all, all content josh is working on is awesome, hes just a really talented guy.
---
uhmmmm Social Akwardness????
---
I'll do it anyway. And state it for what it is, an annoyance, like any player that can provide feedback. Seems like this point of view is pretty standard by now. And no, we're not all lazy asses that want everything handed. I'll do challenge motes any day. Not with slippery slope though.
---
what a beautiful cape. 
---
So you're going to a gym to do a barbell bench press exercise. You want to challenge yourself so you're trying to push up an increased weight or increasing the amount of repeats. But instead they challenge you by oiling your barbell, someones also tickling your toes and doing everything to ruin your training. Basically this is what arenanet is doing with fractals, we get annoying bullshit instead of difficult to perform but cool mechanics.
---
This sounds like my worst nightmare. Being forever locked in a perfect skill rotation so to get that crit on just the right skill, all while keeping track of at least 3 different charges.
---
Sorry, but Id rather do animation cancelling on dragonhunter than this. And I hate dragonhunter AND animation cancelling with a passion.
---
I tried to take a shot at the Meme "Press [F] to pay respect", but I think I failed.
---
Ty~! I wasn't going for this result when I started taking the screenshots, but then I realized that all effects combined would look interesting and a few tries later here it was. [Here are other attempts.](http://imgur.com/gallery/1yt5F8H)
---
Mini-meatoberfast sounds like a meatoberfest dedicated to mini versions of regular meats likke mini sausage or mini steaks and mini hamburgers.
---
There are also lots of people who take heroin and it doesn't make heroin good thing. Just because flies gather around a pile of guano also doesn't make it a nice thing.
---
I can see there are people who don't mind new instabilities but I can't believe there are people who like them or play fractals just for them. There is no way. You can be indifferent about those instabilities, okay, but saying you like them? Nah, no way.
---
Those ideas sound awesome! This screenshot is beautiful, well done.
---
My favorite! Awesome news.
---
Ty!
---
Thank you ~ I'll see about those ideas sometime
---
Don't get me wrong, but why would you want to go there on a such low lvl? Won't you die in a single mob hit?
---
"Getting filled with hate after seeing, hearing or experiencing something you can't stand." that's slang, that's correct. strong feelings =/= vitriol. i'm not wrong.
---
Some people switch to auto once they get used to something that hasn't changed much for a long time, and when you change it, they can't cope with the changes. 
---
I know its a joke but companies do this all the time, lay off people and then secretly bring others back so they can change contracts or get rid of lots of people who would likely complain about being singled out. 
---
My dad got fired that way and got taken back on the next day.
---
the thing is though, i have over 1 k hours in ESO and i am not even close to finishing all the things i want to do in that game, as Yillena said, they need to keep players interested otherwise they are going to go out of business. the fact that some veterans are still interested does not mean the game will survive, i am by no means in the minority here, many people are getting tired with the game and the lack of content, other games can keep up the content releases, there is no reason anet should not be able to when they have proven that they *can* do it when they want to. if gw2 cannot keep up content releases, they will just fall by the wayside and another game will take their place, which is already happening. 
---
Wait...where is this tomb in GW2? I dont think Ive seen it..
---
I'm not gonna waste my time reading all your bullcrap, you could have used your time in a more productive way
---
I hate it too. Polishing the game is important. Most new players start by playing old content anyway.
---
I think they got discouraged after desert and how on most matches, whoever owns desert holds it 99%.
---
They added jump pads, lava portals, more verticality, different guards, shrine buffs, some weird items like lava hound (don't use it pls).
---
Still people prefer alpine way too hard.
---
Im currently on #1 match at EU supposedly and while others BLs have coms, queue and fights, desert is just that - deserted. even EOTM has coms and "fights" if karma train clash.
---
Yes desert has issues. Yes it can be boring. But it's also catch 22. Most coms hate desert, so no one goes desert because there's no com. And no com goes to desert because people aren't there.
---
Hell, most people still don't know what is air keep and fire keep. Some call it fire bay, air hills. Or desert hills.
---
WvW just seems to be high enough popped to have action, but same time low enough to fill all **4 maps**.

i'm not talking about myself, i have a set of ascended for each armour weight, my friends are the ones taking ages. i'm mainly talking about ascended trinkets here as they've all decided they need them, aside from that we are still waiting on the one who hasn't transferred yet ( we will be undermanned even when he joins, he will be our 8th man )

Www.wut.com.uk.evenmoreWUT lol
---
&gt;It's hilarious watching all this delusional anet fanboys getting triggered over simple matter just cause they can't handle the fact their game failed
---
Here's a tip : if yu wanna troll, don't tell us yur goal. 
---
Well... That's a lot of bs. 
---
Calling it dying is an exaggeration. It's hard to be hyped about gw2 as a veteran these days but it's still the best mmo deal for new players. Game is alive, group content is playable and new patches are coming. For at least 2 years we are safe. I am more concerned about what's coming after season 5.
---
That's the spot in Jahai I think, where you do the achieve to cc the fake Joko.
---
How is this even related to GW2?
---
sorry to burst your bubble, but if you do this boss with a proper group you just kill him in melee instead of running around like headless chickens being useless af.
---
I only care if the staircases are fixed, and there are no angry ghosts on every landing.
---
Shattered!
---
Sorry you got ganked in WvW and lost a PvP match.
---
Maybe put the game down for the rest of the night and try again after school tomorrow, good luck!
---
I extremely hate dcing in HoT's story instance for this very reason.
---
More tips:
---
* use some paragraphs so people actually read your stuff
---
* don't start with the part that antagonizes the audience
---
* don't post controversial stuff from a 1 month old account
---
* don't use the word "toxic" in the name of your freshly created account
---
 "Ah, my very own clone. Now neither of us will be virgins!"
---
They started adding more checkpoints sometime in the middle of S3, and in PoF they added dynamically changing instances that connect with each other seamlessly, so you can keep going without loading maps, or leave there and continue later. 
---
Unfortunately, without a 'refurbishing team' reworking old content, they are features that won't be added to older instances.
---
They didn't have time with so much focus switched to their other two projects.
---
Hopefully with their focus on GW2 again, they may look into it and check if they have time and resources to improve older content. 
---
Hopefully.
---
While I agree prospects for the game aren't good because there's pretty much zero excitement at the moment, and even with story releases the excitement isn't exactly massive; I do have to say your post is absolutely atrocious. Textbook bitching and moaning. 
---
From what you've said, it seems to me like you are suffering badly from the effects of stress (as well as sinus problems). Excessive sleeping can be a sign of depression or "checking out" from the world. As you identified, sleeping *lots* isn't the same as sleeping *well*. 
---
See if there is a local mental health group that can recommend you to some ways of supporting yourself stress-wise. I went to a free evening class about managing stress levels and there were about 40 people there, so it it definitely a problem that people are struggling with. 
---
If you're in a position to do so, maybe think about speaking to a doctor about how stressed you are and how exhausted you are. They'll probably refer you to a counsellor, but it can also give you the clout to go back to your employer and say what your doing is unsustainable in its current form, if that's the case. 
---
With your smartphone! No more screenshots pls...
---
Although the way and manner he speaks is cleary unacceptable, the core of his message is sadly true. The game wanted to rewrite the basics of the MMO genre. The beginnings were promising but in the end the project went side ways. All the question marks around what kind of content to ship (weekly, monthly living stories, expansions...) clearly indicate that the devs themselves were finding out what kind of game they would like to develop. No, the game isn't dead but it surely passed it's prime time when it could have been a real game-changer within the MMO genre.
---
Slept cause I was really sick. Now it's mildy sick but I still feel like crap. 
---
Speed runners are trying to get the best time while doing tese runs. By adding instabilities they have it harer . By that the min runing time will be increased a bit. But even then there was a min time for this to be done. They can still be speedrunning. The only thing what changed was the minimum time required to do it. I would understand that they will be mad that they cant be better then the times before, but when the subject changed (added instabilities in this situation) the time counts no more. So there is once again a min time required to complete this task wich means they can again be speedruning. So no my logic doesnt see a problem here at all. Only that hunam nature and been annoyed are the problems here, wich are not in the game, but in you or other speedrunners. 
---
FLUX BOMB.
---
Hey everyone im fairly new so i appreciate any tips on the game!
---
I've recently started playing GW2 (Still running the free version) and am currently playing a hunter. I have looked ahead at builds for Raids/Fractals etc and it seems a great build to go with would be a "Druid/Boon healer". I plan on buying the full game with all expansions and was wondering if anyone has some input on if i should use the 80 boost on this Ranger so i have a raid ready build asap or if i should grind it up.
---
I understand this might be a personal preference question but i am someone who really enjoys Guilds/Raids etc so im thinking i should boost so i can jump into that content.
---
The last question i was wondering if these guide's are accurate https://discretize.eu/builds/ranger/heal-druid , http://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Druid_-_Boon_Support_Healer#Specializations
---
Thanks in advance and again i appreciate any and all tips as i am still new to GW2
---
It's super unsafe. 
---
Savage
---
Additional tips:
---
* Rates are meassured as high or low, not as fast or slow.
---
* Don't drop prepositions and articles "... dying *at an* aproximately high rate ..."
---
* Punctuation is nice, it helps people understand your message.
---
* Back up claims with facts and references, otherwise they are just baseless accusations.
---
You mean you never tried [hanging out with your clones](https://youtu.be/WtwZdaNfCjo?t=119)?
---
It is like you dont have a boosted stamina regen from fractal potions. 
---
Birds are perfect for punishing players who just retardingly spam dodges everywhere, instead of using positioning and other sources of active defence, and can only play reactively, without thinking 5 seconds ahead.

The only thing that is bad about birds is the actual birb npc spawn. That should be removed. 
---
i don't think we have any concrete evidence Anet is only working on gw2 now. But i sure hope so
---
&gt;So no my logic doesnt see a problem here at all. Only that hunam nature and been annoyed are the problems here, wich are not in the game, but in you or other speedrunners.
---
 use your mind for once 
---
I wonder who is really triggered here....
---
Well Im calling myself casual player because I prefer to play relaxed. I dont need to be measuring my ego with anyone else. There is always something more I can learn and always will be. I know a lot about these elitist players because they were coming to me for help. Mostly for challange modes, raids and lately Migrane mission. Yes I wasnt able to keep up from the start with them because Im use to a diferent playstyle but I did everything to help them. The best exampe wich I remmeber is guild SALT.

It's not like I've diagnosed him with cancer. And I've been there where he was, so it's not hard to tell what it may be.

Oh hey that's me.

The first few were funny, but this one is... Meh...

&gt; The amount of ~~protection, resistance,~~ aegis and stability ~~along with cleanse~~ is vital to zerging

FTFY
---
&gt; just because you suck and have big chances of dying doing this doesn't mean everyone else has the same issue
---
As Cleric guard ? Sure . I Would love to dee your K/D for the time you are playing 
---
&gt; healer?
---
Thats someone who is trying to keep you alive while your job is to kill the enemy. 
---
&gt; Guess what, it still works.
---
Yeah thats why you are crying over instabilities not been able to deal with them. Thats why you want to change them. Because your strategy "works" 
---
From what I see around, actual pvp is quite rewarding is it not? Much of it in straight up gold. Reward is always part of why people compete. It is more profitable to run down other zergs, from what I've seen, than actually capping things. In my example people, they said that they were fighting for bags. So anyone who thinks monetary gain as a reward is not relevant in WvW is incorrect.
---
Having some sort of additional reward for the people who put in hard work to come out on top at the end of a match would incentivise more players.
---
There's a thing as having too much support, you still need damage.
---
Well, funny that you say this. In my guild there is this one french guy called Spell. He has over 38k AP or something idk. I am in the same boat as you since we used to play together all the time before I took a major break. Now that I am back to the game I have tried hitting him up but he is always busy with crab toss or WvW achievements. It's sad how ap can ruin friendships like this. 
---
I agree with top comment that it's good riddance, and if you are looking for a new friend to play with add MrTJpwnz.4710 ingame :) 
---
&gt; All they need to do is hire a professional to work on ptimization on game balance etc.
---
Man, why didn't we think of that before ? This is genius spark.
---
&gt;You could still run different builds with great success and a 15 man group could take on a 40
---
Yeah I'm gonna need to see some footage of 15 players playing off meta classes beating 40, thanks
---
&gt;I know a lot about these elitist players because they were coming to me  for help. Mostly for challange modes, raids and lately Migrane mission.

There's nothing gay about it in our eyes.

Between two guys.
---
clones arent really exclusive to wvw and considering OP`s comment, the focus seems to be on having sex with your clone at which point I dont see any relation between this comic and gw2 anymore.
---
Are those comics supposed to be funny...
---
Wait... wasn't this girl an engineer first? then a scourge? and now a mesmer?? Lunacy.
---
Or maybe it's a different asura everytime? hmmm
---
It was a lot better than GW2 at its peak IMO. GW2 lost a bit of the originals magic
---
All MMOs are going downhill, that's the principle of the genre. And they only counter that with new releases, features and content. There is so much you can/are willing to do in current state of any game before you want more or something else.
---
It's then up to the company to provide said content, to hype, to increase the value and the balance of the game. On this point, yes, Anet has progress to make.
---
just a reference to one of the best posts in the old [pvp forums](https://forum-en.gw2archive.eu/forum/game/pvp/gf-left-me-coz-of-ladderboard).
---
All is vain.
---
It's for the easy mode though, which would have worse rewards than normal mode.
---
Why didn't you defend him?
---
For open world i would go for minion necro or core warrior/ spellbreaker. You would have lot of health and defences. 
---
Amy, too. 
---
Important tip regarding MMO mouse: try to let auto-attack work for you instead of spamming 1 with your thumb. I know that's usually the #1 cause of my wrist strain when playing for a long time
---
I have alot to add to this conversation, sadly nothing your brain is capable of understanding. How about you stop trying to "chat" about something you don't understand. Proudly admitting multiaccounting on your "wiki homepage" and saying you will never be able to raid. Guess what, if you're never gonna able to raid you're also not able to do fractals properly. So noone cares about your opinion. Go back into your home instance and ERP with your mounts and cats, at least that's something you might have expertise in.
---
Thank you \^\^
---
Lol I have 87
---
Asura? Clones? Automaton? There are also a lot more Brainless jokes in GW2.
---
Quality Armor. 
---
Thanks
---
If you get offended by talking/joking about weird thoughts you should probably do something about it.
---
I had to smile when I read the 3% bubble. And again about the not my type one.
---
Yep I was the warrior in this. Was indeed a classic GW2 here.
---
I think if you did it more like
---
&gt;Press ~~[F]~~ [V] to ~~pay respect~~ dodge
---
That might have been more clear. 
---
I'm a pleb in Reddit text editing :S
---
But why, just stick to your main class and keep practicing
---
Power reaper maybe? I used to play that when my wrists would act up, but that was a few patches ago. For open world etc. Id just switch in minions and for raids/fractals below 50% set autoattack on GS2.
---
Otherwise... d/wh tempest. The overloads have nice long casttimes to rest between clicking, and you can get away with autoattacking a lot.
---
I can only talk about fractals (which is discretize.eu for). In case you don't know the difference between fractals yet: raids are 10man content with usually 3 big boss fights where fractals are 5 man content with one boss at the end. Druid has a been meta for both for a long time until the last patch. Druid is now still meta for raids but not anymore for fractals. For fractals it's now a Heal Firebrand (Guardian Pof elite) or a Heal renegade (Pof revenant elite).
---
My suggestion would be to boost a Guardian to level 80 to play fractals. As Guardian you can am play every role with the correct gear. Heal firebrand, boon firebrand (quickbrand) and dragonhunter as dps. Fractals are daily content and give more gold than raiding. They are also a great preparation for raiding as raiding for beginners can be quite difficult. From what I can tell are raids slowly shifting away from Druid and chrono as well. Snowcrows.com has also raid meta builds. They recently uploaded a speed clear with a boon firebrand and a heal renegade. 
---
Full on bromo
---
This. Was looking to see if someone mentioned the grammar and dropped words cause I didn’t want to beat a dead horse, but I stopped reading after 2 sentences cause it was so bad. 
---
What is that armour i see people use that darkens their face and makes them all look the same as one another but when you click on their character it shows their portrait without the armour? 
---
I think that should have been the "real meaning" of the Living World, because let's face it, permanent changes you can't experience again suck and are a complete waste of resources.
---
With this model you could:
---
* Modify the environment and don't worry about the consequences. You fail to defend a town? Now it's razed, and will stay like that until the map resets. There's nothing you can do to have it back.
---
* Make event success and failure have a meaningful impact. Some survivors of the razed town won't be happy if you show your face. Merchants and nearby activities might disappear altogether.
---
* Provide a different experience every time you play the map, giving it more replayability. A different storyline plays out depending on event performance and the path you chose. The town is safe? There's conspirators inside, and you gotta find them. The town was destroyed? Escort the caravan of survivors to a safe haven.
---
More examples using GW2's own zones:
---
* **Southsun Cove:** Full isle invasion, from multiple fronts. Players set up the camps and build the fortifications wherever they want.
---
* **Lake Doric:** The city of Divinity's Reach would be part of the map as well, and get invaded by White Mantle forces. You can take it even further, and make a new map including part of Queensdale too. The White Mantle would attack from multiple flanks at once.
---
* **Domain of Istan:** The Sunspear rebels take and hold various Loyalist locations, instead of "leaving because some plague stuff". You win when Istan is completely yours, but you don't have finite resources and might have to stay back now and then.
---
Using this model, story instances would no longer be necessary for the game's storytelling, and all the action could be moved here instead. Ideally, every zone would have different types of events, from singe player stuff to huge 50-man squad bosses.
---
The Asura and the Automaton have nothing to do with the punch line though, which itself is based on a generic joke about cloning.
---
What made the first few comics good was that it was addressing issues specific to Guild Wars 2 - how outfits are designed for Asura / Charr and perceptions around the age and maturity of Asura characters - while the more recent ones have been generic jokes about trans people, breasts or clones which just have a GW2 skin.
---
It isn't so much about being offended (probably the trans joke was about the only one that was offensive) but that these comics aren't funny, original or relevant. 
---
Let her smash :c
---
Usually, I try to recommend to level as high as you can before using a boost if it's your first time leveling a character. There are some things that aren't well stated/well taught in game that you can practice while leveling, such as combo field manipulation, reflects/projectile blocks/destroys, etc. 
---
That said, I would try to get to level 40, and see how you're doing. If you're confident and ready to push to 80, go ahead and use the boost. If not, keep leveling. If you're level 65/70, I would save the boost for a different character. 
---
Those guides are accurate, but the context of those guides are important. Discretize is a guild whose guides and builds are largely written for fractals, which are endgame dungeons. While differences in builds may be small, there are definitely traits/setups that differ between raids and fractals. Snowcrows is typically the go-to for raid builds and guides. Metabattle is also a good site, but may lack information that guild sites may provide. 
---
The important thing is to just check all the resources available to you; look at each build site and see what the similarities and differences are, and see if you can recognize *why* they're building the character that way. A big part of growing as a player is understanding how your character works, not just gearing them and equipping the skills you're told to.
---
Some reasons:  
---
1. I already have played 5 seasons with my main class and its getting boring hovering at Gold3/Plat1.  
---
2. I want to complete the Legendary PvP Backpiece and this requires playing Ranked with other class builds.  
---
3. My main class build is a DPS and highly reflex based and I wish to switch to something more chill.
---
How about you change your keybinds to you keyboard instead.
---
Im using 12345qertfyxcv^ Strg leftshift and i never get these issues, even playing the clickiest class for PvE(condi engi).
---
Might take some getting used too though.
---
And correct grammar and capitalization. 
---
#***WHERE'S THE CAKE, EGGMAN?!***
---
&gt; They come for the achievements, then they stay if they happen to like the game mode.
---
I would say make new ones, not change the old.
---
&gt; Spammers don't use paid accounts with hundreds of hours. Also, they don't use mail either, they use whispers, which have far less limitations.
---
I have seen gold sellers spamming on map chat, in whispers, and in mails.  They do use paid accounts, as they probably get them for cheap on shady 3rd party sites.  Not like they care about what happens to it.
---
I personally enjoy these threads mostly for the hilarious comments like yours and rude asura
---
I tried to test it myself, but all it wants to do is send a text message to me :P
---
Name checks out. 
---
Tell me. Is your scrapper Asura?
---
I miss the AI from the beta weekends lol.
---
Also, they should really tune down the number of attribute combinations, and leave just a handful of 6-10 to choose from. The rest are useless anyway.
---
It was quite painful disabling gw2 hook and radial menu but for situations like WvW this is quite useful! although i did crash after 1 hour and coudln't queue back in sadly...
---
Oh god I didn't see it until you pointed it out. Why did I read your comment, *WHY!?* Dear lord that mess.
---
OP is right, shield is far superior to hammer in this setup. And I'm curious what you think the wrong traits are that's he's chosen.  
---
This conversation is not only me and you. Everyone can see how you are making fool of yoruself. So if you want to add something productive for once please go ahead. Also Im not multiaccounting. Dont know where you are from but EU does have diferent rules about it then USA. EU have it a lot more complicated. There is multiaccouting, multiboxing, booting wich should be the same as USA have and many more. I would lie if I would say that I was never banned but as you can see Im still playing. 
---
Im not able to raid because of my health problems, not because I dont know what to do and thats the diference. I would love to prove you that I would be better in raids then you ever will be but sadly I cant and never will be able to. Still dont know how raids have any connection to Fotm from your staitment but alright. 
---
&gt;noone cares about your opinion. 
---
Then you wouldnt still be here trying so hard to prove me wrong ;) 
---
I've tried it but unfortunately it makes Gw2 crash due to a texture error. Shame I really wanted for it to work.
---
Anet fixing bugs lol funny joke
---
&gt; parcours ? 
---
You mean Uncategorized ? Or something else ? 
---
I couldn't help but laugh when he called the game a failure. As if years of success are irrelevant because the game is going towards the end of it's life cycle. It's like saying Michael Jordan is a failure because he retired lol All games die eventually but this one still had some life left.
---
I agree mechalegs is a shit trait in this setup and the blast heal is significantly better.  The only difference i run in my build is to take kinetic stabilizer over applied force. This generally gives you stab on both shield skills and when you activate your function gyro which happens all the time. This gives you a much needed extra source of stab which is the one weakness of the build
---
I don't think psychologists diagnose people with cancer lul
---
I think it might have something to do with how the fractal rewards are structured. Especially for people who do fractals every day and are aiming for fractal god. Fractals become a chore that you try to power through as quickly as possible and any slight delays become huge annoyances to a lot of players. This makes the better fractals (e.g. Deepstone) some of the worst fractals.
---
if you have a second account and team up with that one to do the story instance that takes you there ... but that would be too slow for farming. I do SW and Drytop farming with low level toons, need two alt accounts on each map for some heropoints though

---
**Punctuation**
---
Punctuation (formerly sometimes called pointing) is the use of spacing, conventional signs and certain typographical devices as aids to the understanding and correct reading of handwritten and printed text whether read silently or aloud. Another description is, "It is the practice action or system of inserting points or other small marks into texts in order to aid interpretation; division of text into sentences, clauses, etc., by means of such marks."In written English, punctuation is vital to disambiguate the meaning of sentences. For example: "woman, without her man, is nothing" (emphasizing the importance of men), and "woman: without her, man is nothing" (emphasizing the importance of women) have very different meanings; as do "eats shoots and leaves" (which means the subject consumes plant growths) and "eats, shoots, and leaves" (which means the subject eats first, then fires a weapon, and then leaves the scene). The sharp differences in meaning are produced by the simple differences in punctuation within the example pairs, especially the latter.

**Paragraph**
---
A paragraph (from the Ancient Greek παράγραφος paragraphos, "to write beside" or "written beside") is a self-contained unit of a discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea. A paragraph consists of one or more sentences. Though not required by the syntax of any language, paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer prose.

Played 1 for many years, pretty much all the factions in 2 got a lot of their lore in 1&amp; expansions. So playing 2, everything is really familiar. 2 didn’t have the addictive pull 1 had, but still loving it.

I'm going to recommend power Herald. Set your first ability to auto-cast so you don't have to hit that attack. Toggle on an upkeep skill, sit on a target's face, then F1 and activate an upkeep after that. Your whole rotation is 2 buttons every 9 seconds. It's not the best, but it works fine in open world and is probably the absolute minimum button presses in the game.
---
Mom said it's my turn to shitpost on reddit.
---
You have no idea what you are talking about and are incredibly condensing in doing so.  You want to stay in medkit as much as possible for the additional outgoing healing effectiveness and mdf heals, switching to fumigate on cooldown.  It is actually not particularly hard to blast on your own fields in a coordinated group.  Why u are camping hammer on a minstrel build is anyone's guess.   You're stroking Angeels balls here when he himself said he plays gvg and clearly doesn't have much of an idea about zvz. Most of what he's said above is bullshit
---
He will never be able to play a story chapter
---
OP's question was clearly meant as a joke.  Whether or not you think it's a funny joke, it doesn't change the context of the  posted image, which is directly related to GW2 and well within the rules of this sub.  Saying they "started a moral discussion" is just grasping at straws.
---
I'd say you're more out of line here than OP, since trying to start fires in their posts about alleged rule-breaking for unrelated content when it's clearly GW2-related and claiming that NSFW jokes are inappropriate because  asura are "kids" sounds like a witch hunt.  You can just scroll past posts you don't like instead of crusading against the OP.
---
yeah I know . But by transfering the system you would find a problem that lvl 99 and lvl 100 does already have normal and challange mode. With those two you would need to choose wich one to keep and wich one to throw away. So you would keep those two challange modes as they are now or keeping normal lvl 99 difficulty and making those your new challange modes ? 
---
So both ranger and ritualist have the same abbreviation?

this has pobably been discussed to the point of exhaustion, but i seem to have missed it, sooo: when do you think episode 6 will come out? given that ep5 released on january 8th, the latest possible release date for hitting the 2-3 month release cadence would be april 9th. however, i guess that this week and several weeks before that will collide with the SAB event. additionally, 2 out of the 3 stories for all or nothing: requiem are still coming up, which i assume they want to release prior to the next episode. then again, i think i remember a quote from mike after episode 5 was a couple of weeks late, that they had to take the additional time to iron out some problems, but this should help them in releasing future episodes even quicker! then again, recent developments at the studio are probably an understandable reason to push the release a bit down the line... i don't really know and it's hard to guess, but i assume that the next update is going to be huge (probably a new raid with legendary ring, at least one legendary greatsword, and the grand finale for season 4), so i can't wait to get my paws on it all... so what do you guys think?
---
My ranger is an 80 with mastery 50.
---
German.   Its a Ritu/Ranger.
---
Interesting. So what is Warrior?
---
[K]rieger
---
Language differences. 
---
You still don't understand. You wouldn't be able to choose any normal T4 normal mode fractal because there wouldn't be such thing. In other words, normal mode for T4s would be challenge mode.
---
Ranger you say, aren't you just holding down left mouse button in action camera?

Joke aside, it depends on the content you do, if it's casual gameplay, maybe warrior, staff ele, or necro as you say

On a serious response, use the keyboard as someone else suggested; more than the mmo mouse. I have 2 side buttons on my mouse for dodge and a skill, the rest of my hotkeys are on the keyboard. Just seeing what an mmo mouse looks; it's like having a keyboard in your mouse lol. Consider using buttons near the "wasd" keys like q, e, r, c, and z for utility skills. If you don't mind using your pinky like I do consider combinations of keys like "shift+1" up to "shift+5" is what most my F-skills are keyed to just because I don't like reaching the top of my keyboard. Or even "Space+1" if you rebind your jump. Be flexible with the keyboard than the mouse since using 12 buttons on a mouse I can imagine strain your muscles in the thumb faster than using 5 on your keyboard. Relying mostly on your mouse when you have so many options in the keyboard is wasted potential to alleviate your mouse hand vise versa imo. gl.

&gt; I dont care about upvotes or downvotes. You shouldnt as well. You have  less Karma then me. Im here to talk about instabilities with others, to  know their oppinion thats all .

I have less karma than you? Who the fuck cares? Except you apparantly. People downvote you because you're talking nonsense, I don't really get what you think this has to do with me caring about karma.

Bingo, but I'm not going to bother if it requires a TP to friend.  Maybe every once in a while but I was hoping to rapid fire them since Fen is so damn quick to complete with mounts.
---
Super frustrated right now since I bought a slot on sale and I've been map completing with it.  Only 1 key out of 6 completed zones.
---
The comics are related to GW2, as I've explained.  Discussions within posts don't change that.  And in the post you linked, OP said, "Damned kids, always stealing my breasts," which again, was very clearly meant in jest.  "Damned kids" is a common expression and you should be well aware of that.  I'm 37 years old and my parents call my entire generation "damned kids."  I call people under 30 "kids."  You're taking OP's words out of context and being deliberately obtuse to harass them, and OP previously called you out for trying to start fires by twisting their words.  And I'm calling you out for it now.
---
I would like to see a new fractal with just a vertical slope at 45 degrees then people going "WOO SLIPPERY SLOPE IS SO FUN AND IS SUCH A GOOD INSTABILITY!"
---
Jk, Anet please don't. I'll buy more Gems, so please don't. 
---
O yeah he bound it to his mouse. That sounds really obnoxious though
---
How so ? They use meta builds and I suggested to use ranged weapons for a while so they wouldnt die and get heals from their healer. I never said that using ranged weapons would become a new meta or that its a right thing to do. Just that its a possibility they can do while having problems with instabilities. So please tell me where in this statement is a flaw ? 
---
Imagine they would pump up the PvE damage to the amount of lategame Path of Exile damage.
---
At that point players would need to invest in some sort of Defensive Gear. Compareable to agony Resistance, but without the Ability to invest in more Offensive Points. 
---
Based on a fact when they were posting about not been able to complete Fractals with specific instabilities. If you are able to do them just fine without healer then gratz. 
---
The meta was never required as much as it now is all I'm saying. If you want to get fired up about go for it, but there were at least a few viable builds per class back than compared to the 1 and done most classes have now. Pugs could compete more regularly with guild groups pre PoF, but now it's a real struggle because you need the right comps in each squad. Just my opinion. 
---
Correct.
---
Surf in GW2. Hmmm. 
---
You know now that I think about it....
---
SAB WORLD 4 BABY
---
At least you have no problems with We Bleed Fire then, right?  Corrosive Poison Cloud makes it basically a non-instability.
---
Not EVERY part of the game should be meant for casuals. There should be some hard content (raids, high fractals) for those who want the challenge. There's plenty of casual content already. Having said that, for sure some instabilities could use some rework.
---
Gotcha, thanks!
---
Just let me press F to acquire daily fractal reward ANet.
---
This game was always for casuals! Casuals also buy more gems so they are the perfect target audience for an mmorpg!!
---
Effort is not equal quality.
---
Arcdps and TacO were verified and greenlighted by ANet, so I think this answer the question to "why are they more trustworthy"
---
Omg u cant just call minion master stupid. That's really elitist. If I have fun playing  necro then its the best class and meta in the game.
---
Playing a class and role you don't enjoy because you want to pug fractals for some loot, now that would be stupid!!
---
I have some questions:
---
Do you asume Aurene died, and thus is in the mists? Or do you asume she traveled there to get help?
---
Im curious. Did you do fracs before HoT?
---
The right way to win the game is to not play at all.
---
You get more gold farming dumb events anyway.

Yeah I rarely have a brand new level 80 to do maps with, so I did the easier ones (SW, Dry Top, Bloodstone) and some HoT while getting my specialization unlocked... all transmutation charges.  I got 1 key for finishing Queensdale.
---
Even if they _just_ introduced the guild hall capture events as missions (so if your guild picked gilded hollow, the available event locations are the PoF &amp; other HoT hall)

I assume she died yes.

I'VE FOUGHT MUDCRABS MORE FEARSOME THAN YU
---
i have 5k+ hours and i never had these issues. maybe buy some special mouse pad?
---
I didn't know what this site was and thought Spain players were just losing access to the game. 
---
I made a few changes since I posted which you can look at here: [https://imgur.com/gDilYKM](https://imgur.com/gDilYKM)
---
Forget about community interaction. They fired Gaile Gray, one of the main people behind the community team. She had been there since early GW1.
---
&gt; They dont come to me for advie but to heal them. 
---
Even if waking up might hurt, I can promise you no good player wants a full clerics healing guard to heal them on raids or CM :)
---
&gt; They are better player in comperesion to me
---
You're saying that like it's something special being better than you.
---
&gt; I have everything in PVE 
---
Apparantly you don't. I know raids are a pretty recent addition for a slow thinking person, but raids are considered PvE content.
---
&gt;I have in on my wiki page so when my friends would be doing raids, they  can just simply show the commander the page to let him know.  That they are experienced players in raids just not on their own account right now 
---
If you seriously think anyone but a training group (which doesn't require anything) would accept a random wiki page with some boss icons as a validated KP of having done these bosses before, ... I don't know, lost for words. Guess Einstein was right with his famous quote.
---
Catalan! And yep, from the Latin family :) 
---
I think they are about the same amount of fun now, as before. By far the most infuriating thing in fractals is being a part of a bad team that constantly wipes. 
---
Are people who are only doing 99CM asking for essence? or maybe they were a 100CM+99CM+T4 group where 1 person left after 100CM but they kept the same req (which would be understandable). If it's really only a 99CM(+T4) group then it's a bit weird to ask for essence (like asking specifically for a KP from Sloth for VG).
---
Fortunatelyt most of the 99CM "only" groups I have seen have an "Unclean" implicit requirement (which is low I know but still).
---
Time is not difficult. Doing something mindless is also not difficult or skillful, just extremely boring.
---
Same here, I had an "oh sh-" moment before reading it was a fan site.
---
It also doesn't help. It makes the training less fun, less impactful and less useful overall. Increasing the weight will do the opposite but increase difficulty as well. 
---
How is party comp the issue here? You could be running 5 healers and still have this happen because it's a bug with the fractal itself. Glad you were able to finish it, but that's not the issue here - rather that there's a glaring bug with the fractal itself that needs to be addressed, or an option for us to respawn at a different checkpoint, since the one we spawned at just made us fall to our deaths. 
---
Glad you assumed we just rushed in by the way. :)
---
We have plenty of content for hardcore players like raids, cms, pvp esports and gvg. Why not make content for casuals?
---
wish it had a particle effect 
---
&gt;that it just sounds like a raid with a potentially higher player count
---
My bad if it's sound like a raid :(
---
Shure, there should be scaling depending on how much people enter the expedition and when I talk about mechanics I mean this bosses need jus a little bit tactic to slay them. Not just spam autoattack. This bosses will be fine if will be on par with bosses in SW under the forts and main boss will be like Scarlet Hologram fight on the Breachmaker. No need of special roles or builds like TT, just understending basics and command work.
---
&gt;This isn't even getting into skills like Feedback that would actually hurt a chronomancer's ability to do their job,
---
There is no need to use feedback. Make chrono take inspiration, trait focus skills to reflect. Voila, now you have a 5 seconds wall of reflection on 16 seconds cd. And before it expires you can also use it as a pull. Maybe chrono will also learn to share aegis, while it is on it.
---
Oh, and there are also focus phantasms.
---
Not with my team build. :)
---
Dude you crazy Sylvari are plants that woke from a dream led by a mom like figure in the pale tree while tennos.... woke from a dream.... and is led by a mother like figure.... in Lotus.... wait..... oh shit. 
---
does anet ususally do big changes like this..?
---
Only complain about slippery, like in deep stone it's trashing your team out in the one that finding the way to the other side that you need to flash the tiles. As a healer I am, it's harder than ever to aim the target area, then bunch of your teammates flying everywhere LOL. All other instabs are fine. What actually bother me besides slippery are outflanked and fire, but of course it depends on the combo of instabs, let say Slippery+birds+anything = bump into each other then slide out and most of the time you try to get to target not to slip away too much you use dodge, then bird is up and no dodge to get it off lol. Slippery + Birds + (Outflanked or Fire), or Outflanked+-30%HP+Birds
---
Just add a BLC key as a reward.
---
Rather than a bug, it's an imperfection of "screen space reflection". and the reason why raytracing is a much more realistic render solution.
---
Most Spanish-speaking players I know actually play in English and only visit sites in English. They probably have been leaking users more and more as players get better at English.
---
You are not a scrub if you do all those things. Welcome to the "good casuals exist" club. 
---
They took voluntary redundancy and they worked at the company for a long time. They probably got a huge payout.

&gt;you need to take some boon removal and press it every 20 sec.

Genius! A wholesome instabilitites that really makes you think and adapt in your strategies!

---
&gt;you need to take some projectile hate and press it every 20 sec.
---
Reee, what a cancer, fractals are aids!!11
---
Ah, that sounds a little better. I wasn't trying to disparage difficult content for guilds, but if it's content that is as difficult as a raid but gives worse rewards, you may as well just go into a raid as a guild group instead.
---
That sounds a little better, but I still think the rewards need a bit of a jump. Nothing along the lines of legendaries/ascended/huge amounts of gold, but (implying that Anet would go this route, but this is a pipe dream) something along the lines of unique skins; mount skins with a saddle/flag with your guild emblem, or novelties that display your guild in some way. 
---
It has a certain charm to it, doesn't it. I've already have a certain scenarios on it,too.
---
but raids aren't exactly rewarding D:
---
Please, please stop making these.
---
Sorry, but that's not an opinion, it's a fact. If I would put 100 hours into a painting it doesn't mean it's good. It would still be trash because I can't paint.
---
I like the_happy_hob streams, he streams from software games challenge on twitch, all 5 games back to back during one sitting with no hit taken (demon's souls, dark souls 1/2/3, bloodborn). He is also hilarious british cunt and I love it.

Thanks!

Ty dulfy for the quick preview.

What my WvW Guild goes through with mounts &amp; when it comes to fights:
---
1.) Scrappers use Stealth Gyro / Groups Blast Stealth
---
2.) Mount Warclaw (Because you're invisible)
---
3.) Rush group while invisible - Frontline uses Warclaw Jump, backline will just dismount to bomb
---
4.) We won.  
---
It's very dumb, no real thinking involved &amp; it sadly, discourages players but this is what Anet wanted, they wanted to bring mounts into WvW so WvW players will spend money.   
---
And we both were lied to by mom to "Protect" us,  we both have our edgy and angry cousins Nightmare Court and Acolyte, we both get a broken sword at the end of our bug quest Caladbolg and War, both end up killing our creators Mordremoth and Orokin. Hmmm you right, we not similar at all. 
---
Oh no...
---
it happens occasionally, especially when it's been pounded into people's heads to always bring FBs, then everyone shows up on an FB
---
No, actual skilled roamers are disagreeing with you low skilled gankers who only prey on isolated zerglings. Actual roamers looking for fights are having a good time with each other, mounts haven't changed anything. 
---
I miss GW1 so much.

looks better than legendaries lol

90% of spanish players didnt use that anyway, most of the spanish players i know just use reddit

wait this isnt MAMA XD
---
I wish this wasn't tagged NSFW so I would've known not to click on it from the thumbnail.
---
&gt;If I put 100 hours into a painting it will not turn out good. It would still be trash because I can't draw.
---
HAH way to prove my point. Just get yourself a name/contacts and you will be selling those trashy art for quite a good sum ;)
---
Yes, generally I see a lot of 99 CM + T4 (100+ essences).
---
I tend to only do CMs when they are also dailies, which is why it's frustrating.
---
What a disturbingly precise description.
---
Is it neccessary to buy expansions then if you want to enjoy game equally? ;x
---
I thought it was in game achievement skin, guess not RIP
---
What I wish Fractals were is a more pure vision of the "random" encounter. Swamp was a great example of this. Do you fight Bloomhunger OR the Mossman? You could even pull some cool shit with these sorts of random draws because you could then tune the encounters rather than the instability. Maybe the Mossman ignores critical power damage whereas Bloomhunger shrugs off conditions. I'd like to play the "Same" fractal, but have different experiences each time. Also, I have to imagine adding more potential encounters to a fractal is much less work than adding new instabilities, adding new fractals, etc.
---
fractal/raid team got laid off so all you will see is friendship campaign
---
More or less.
---
As a Spanish player I almost had a heart attack with the title
---
But doesn't surprise me either, the community over here has always been pretty much dead
---
Way to fail at making money for the company. 
---
&gt;You do think that healing others is fun ? No and yet someone needs to be doing it.
---
Huh? Are you serious? There's plenty of people that enjoy healing.
---
Are you talking about those that drop siege onto enemy corpses out in the middle of a field as a means of BM?
---
You're not going to be able to stop them from doing it, and taking away player privilege of your allies to do so will see some players joining squads less often. Yeah it seems silly, but giving the commander means to restrict their squads capabilities is not something most would go for
---
At best, just tell your squad not to use supply on that siege. Honestly anyone playing for longer than a couple days should/would hopefully know that it's just a BM measure and not waste supply.
---
&gt; Do instabilities annoy you?
---
&gt; Do they feel forced and unfun?
---
Annoying and unfun game mechanics ARE NOT GOOD!
---
Yes, you can deal with them somehow, but that does not make these good in any way. 
---
Fact is that some new instabilities make certain specs (mostly DPS ones) just a lot more annoying - they dont make it more challenging by giving you new obstacles where you have to be creative to bypass these or alike. There is no way to avoid e.g. SS; certain specs are just more annoying to play with it since they got a lot of movement abilities - worst case you loose some amount of DPS. If on the other hand you could counter it with Stability, it would become a kinda good one, but that is not the case. Birds are just an unfair disavantage for every DPS-spec which relies on single hard hitting attacks; it wont make the fight harder, just longer (mostly).
---
&gt; and everything was hitting harder, we had no healers and relied on boss tells, dodges and team comp to even finish a fractal.
---
Also allow me to correct you: Enemies are hitting harder nowadays on T4, but you have more access to Protection, Aegis and overall more healing - that part is true.
---
&gt; Comp doesn't matter, dodges don't matter, build doesn't matter, can facetank everything!
---
I am not sure how you survive ALL kind of attacks on Weaver/Thief/... at some T4/CMs without any Protection - in that case allow me to open a ticket since some are basically oneshot mechanics.
---
&gt; we get more annoyed and frustrated after 6 years of same content.
---
Instabilities did not add new content, they just changed it - not saying it was generally a bad idea.
---
Good players know which ones to build. 
---
[Well yes, but actually no.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/028/596/dsmGaKWMeHXe9QuJtq_ys30PNfTGnMsRuHuo_MUzGCg.jpg)
---
Not at the beginning, but eventually yes.
---
Ill post it as soon as I get home.
---
To try the game the free base is fine. To get competitive and play pvp or eve you need the expansions. 
---
repeatedly telling them to not do that, and that if they want to contribute with their blueprints they have the option of donating them.
---
you can also try to train your zerg to shame people for (repeatedly) throwing random siege.
---
far from perfect, but the only options available.
---
Expansions add new movement abilities (gliding, mounts) and elite specializations (new skills, weapon types and gameplay features for all classes).
---
Exclusively when you burst to help a teammate take care of someone else. Not for moving nor disengaging
---
Well it's an unwritten rule, that only the comms drop blueprints. But there are always newling which don't know about it, trolls trolling as they are meant to do, and people to greedy or just unable to learn that it's a waste of supplys and interfering with the plans of the commander. 
---
Meat plaza ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I've stopped playing fractals all together since last week. I just can't stand all those horrendus random combos anymore.
---
It isn'y a wyvern because it hasnt legs. See, Two wings, two arms, but no legs. It's just an abomination. Neither of wyvern or dragon.
---
Yes. Also, ignore your friend and focus on what YOU want to play. You have nine classes and almost all of them can take builds in flat/power damage, DoT/condi damage, and some manner of support (healing, overhealing, or boon support).
---
My personal favorite build for Mesmer is actually using the other elite spec, Mirage. Tons of condi damage and lots of evades makes it fun to mess around with.
---
So take a moment to look at some builds on Metabattle and see what you actually like. Personally, I would never suggest a person new to the game play support chrono when there are so many more classes/builds that are more fun and less annoying to play.
---
Honestly, PoF was so cathartic after the original story felt like it could have taken place in any other fantasy game setting. My husband can tell you, there were moments where I guessed something, or almost cried seeing what happened to an NPC from GW1. He has yet to play through it, but we bought him GW1 and I've been poking him to play through the story with me. It'll be amusing seeing his reactions in reverse!
---
Same but then, moving parts=not in-game reward (which tend to be of lesser quality).
---
Not those people. I mean those people who drop unnecessary siege in front of a gate or near a wall, and most of them are paper Rams and paper catas. It is so annoying. I don't want to yell at people while commanding but this has gotten out of control since the devs have added the mounts to WvW.
---
A Wyvern with arms?
---
Yes, but the issue isn't tied to rewards and was never the issue in WoW either. It is the disparity between how player power is perceived across raids. As much as possible, you don't want maximum player power output (DPS, healing, boons) to change between an easier mode and a more difficult one if progression is expected.
---
However, I can see the merit to your points and if implementing  it as an optional food buff instead of 15 people (which I still feel is better for learning mechanics) is easier then I'd rather have that route over no variable difficulties. 
---
Well it has arms, but no legs to technically is could still be considered a Wyvern 
---
Ty~! Iron Marches, above the remains of the broken wall where broken off pillars float in the air. This was the highest pillar overlooking the Shatterer area.
---
I dunno about that one
---
Just wanted to give a shoutout to /u/dulfy for tirelessly keeping us peons up to date on the game, both here and on her site.  Thank you, ma'am!
---
Those DLCs that is released between expansions are free if you log before the next release.
---
The amount of times I've seen "your comp is the issue, run more necros" in this sub makes me genuinely concerned for the level of player skill in fractals. I'm glad I have a static and only pug on days where people are busy.
---
I would welcome any new guild mission content and a revision in the ways to spend guild commendations.  
---
Does the Experience Booster and Exploding Draketail stack? Or will one overwrite the other?
---
You can see ruby streaming the game on gw2 channel from time to time. If you see this, you won't aks for seeing them doing t4s with Cms anymore.
---
No, the expansions you should get, but the quarterly dlc (living world seasons) are helpful, but not necessarily an immediate must buy
---
Heart of thorns+path of fire are the expansions you need to buy with real money
---
The other pieces can be bought with gems in game, which can be farmed with gold.
---
Also, if you're online within the three month window between each episode of living world, you unlock the current episode for free 
---
To expand on the thought, what if the killing blow only killed joko in Aurene, harry potter style...? 
---
I do really like your speculation tho! 
---
Most experience/karma boosters stack as long as they are from different sources.  These will stack. Celebration and birthday boosters dont, for example. 
---
To be needlessly pedantic because these comments are already a trainwreck - PG-13 isn't an ESRB rating, which are advisory age ranges with respect to the content flags. In this respect Guild Wars 2 is teen but not flagged for suggestive content, unlike FFXIV which has numerous references to sex.
---
What does that mean? Probably not much seeing as the subreddit was keen on these style of comics when they were more focused on the game and community rather than just unoriginal jokes about sexual matters. 
---
Thank you, that's very helpful answer &lt;3
---
At lvl 80 you will have enough points to buy all skills and traits so don't worry about picking anything now.
---
About gear there is no point (and any way) of obtaining it before so pick and use anything you want before 80.
---
Preparing and training, trying to pick skills and traits that support chrono use is bad idea. Not only you will level slowly because you will sacrifice dps/survivability for support, but also you will lack people to support anyway. 
---
Also, maybe you don't know but team builds won't work in solo pve content anyway, because they are made for a party where you receive proper boons, healing and have actual dps classes.
---
For leveling try everything because you won't be supp chrono 100% of the time. Find builds, weapons and skills that suits you.
---
After getting 80lvl then you can gear up and learn support.
---
Cheaper than most AAA titles, and with a hell lot more content to boot.
---
I understand that not everyone's economic situation is the same, but "very expensive" is hyperbole.
---
It does sound like you are slipping into a depression... Might want to follow the previous advice given here and do look for professional help. You'd be surprised how those people can change your view of the world. 
---
It's still up and running (afaik it runs on the GW2 Servers as its not that demanding) and only gets the most necessary treatment it needs to keep running. But you can still buy and play it as much as you wish, and you can still earn all the bonusses for GW2. 
---
There is an NPC at the spawns that give some information but some of these things are specific things players have decided on. Even if WvW was well maintained game mode with a full time team behind it they probably wouldn't be updating things to account for changes to player tactics.
---
I think in general if you are new to some already established thing then it is better to spend some time observing how things are done first. Ask questions if necessary and offer suggestions if you see room for improvements.
---
Ask for required reading ... how many terms of service agreements have you read through lately? :)
---
Real happy with how this area turned out in Jahai. It's pretty impossible for "Mysterious red glow coming from a statue" to not look cool, but the updated statue really turned out great.

PvP population is too low already to want to split up into more queues.

Regardless, I would like to see queues for all game modes. Conquest got stale years ago.

Been there, done that. Didn't change much.

well... we doesnt count for me; i mean yes the fact that its not BLTChest is good; but the skin seems ridiculous to me; i cant imagine what that hatchling is subjected to in the hands of a guardian

This is... fantastic news for the nostalgia nug of my brain. Now to figure out what my log in details were.
---
I have so many annual celebration presents to collect!!
---
not the worst instabilities you could have had. Still somewhat impressive, nice work
---
I'd hazard to guess that it's the main reason you (and me tbf) actually know those Spanish-speaking players. 
---
The ones that cuddle up in their own servers won't interact with you that soon, making your comment somewhat suffering from a confirmation bias.
---
That's funny. Forget i made this post. It's useless. 
---
get at least hundred machetes before doing dragon's stand, use taco to find all nodes. This way you have to this event only 3 times for 250 crystalline ore.
---
Heavily disagree, and there's a big reason why M+ was the most popular feature from legion and is continued on for future expansions.
---
Also, affixes are definitely content, and M+ versions of bosses sometimes have mechanics that normal/heroic dont.
---
Up to a point, difficulty also matters outside of "well, its harder" because it makes certain things matter more- it brings out the game's aspects more. More legitimate choices, more decisionmaking. 
---
Dont buy legendary shards for offhand weapons from laurel merchant.

You can park you character at Matriarch spawning spot (Verdant Brink meta boss) for relatively fast daily gemstone.

River in Bitterfrost contained few coral nodes with high chance of droping coral orbs. You can park another character there + grabing chests above.

Get to the map earlier before it fills. Also there’s a soft cap at first so keep trying to join before giving up. 
---
&gt;  make fractals actually challenging instead of adding random, cancerous instabilities 
---
okay how? The current approach to adding challenge (via random instabilities) is hated by a vocal part of the player base. From what I can tell the most hated instabilities are always the ones that deal damage to the player and mess with a dps rotation. So how do you add challenge with out it becoming annoying after doing it again for the 100th time.
---
So the entire area was greyed our when I tried to play yesterday. Today a waypoint finally appeared when I logged in lol. It seems like some sort of glitch. It happened to me with bitterfrost too, but luckily I was able to run through the portal for access to that area 
---
Thief requieres high reflexes if you don't want to get yeeted by literally any damage role profession so i'd say it's not what OP is looking for.

Sticking to decapping would still be possible but I think it's not really worth to play thief only for that when there are other professions you can play that can allow you to fullfill a role completely.

First thing that hit me in Skyrim VR was a fucking crab from behind, was admiring the scenery, fucker made me jump.

Talking about MMO mouse users. Learn to read

have you tried swapping instances instead of staying in a bugged one for 36 hours?
---
Alright, if we have to debate the lore of these comics, it's the exact same character in all of them, and she was established in "Flat Injustice" as being a female asura.  And that's good enough for me, because I'm not here to critique someone's art style.  On that note, I don't see you telling Monstrum their comic character's horns are way too small and therefore "The Commander And.." isn't relevant because of that.
---
&gt; So in other words, the joke has been done before?
---
So in other words, "mesmers having adult fun with their illusions" is canon.
---
Maybe they don't understand the difference between armor skins and outfits?
---
At this point I am pretty sure Anet doesn't want any mode besides conquest to become mainstream.
---
**B**ad **M**anners, think of something like teabagging in Call of Duty or \/dance when you get a kill on an enemy. It's intentionally rude or even detrimental behavior to say "haha I beat you" (in this case, wasting your siege. In terms of \/dance or teabagging, it can get you killed if you're caught off-guard).
---
Reaper is pretty easy 
---
Turns out running an MMO fan site costs money. 
---
&gt; Honestly I don't understand Joko's immortality magic. Is it the same as Livia's?
---
Definitely not. Livia used the Scepter of Orr to extend her life, and she isn't undead. Joko is undead and has never had access to the Scepter of Orr, so his version of immortality has to be different. 
---
The only other lich we know much about is [Vizier Khilbron](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Vizier_Khilbron). The [Undead Lich](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Undead_Lich) he became had the same auto-resurrecting properties unless he was killed on the Bloodstone to capture his soul and magic. 
---
Thanks for the head's up, friend! I only remember one character's name because it was so cringey that I deleted it. In my defense, I made it when I was mid-late high school.

Some guild builds use defender for improved personal sustain. It is a viable alternative to monk if that’s what you’re looking for/need, you can’t group sustain if you’re dead after all. 
---
It's not that much AND there are free hostings.
---
especially on daredevil you shouldnt have problems take invigorating precision dodge one time and heal of the birds with your next attacks
---
By my country standard it is very expensive if our average pay is - 350 euro monthly for full time job. For some it might be very cheap, for some it's an okay, I of course say it by my standard of what's expensive or not

I don't think the wings are lower limbs, they appear to be at roughly the same height as the arms.

Hmm, I have also never seen such a creature in fantasy. The closest I can think of (functional wings, one pair of functional forelimbs, no hindlimbs) is the [viper](https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/intermediary/f/31deaa70-f2f9-48a1-b2e8-3cff2f0f157f/d5xrdja-4d691f84-c355-43a6-90e5-bbd3761978e4.jpg/v1/fill/w_609,h_350,q_70,strp/zerg_viper_by_phillgonzo_d5xrdja-350t.jpg) from Starcraft II.

&gt;  I wouldnt have gone so far as to slam my desk

that desk slam was hyper aggressive and over the top, totally uncalled for!

Also if you can't wait for a sale (usually 50% off). DLGamer has a pretty consistent sale ([38% off right now on the pack](https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-heart-of-thorns-path-of-fire-us-43911))

The post is. I got rid of it. It's fine. I'll just figure this out.

Artificial difficulty is bad design.

Park however many character you have at Pagga's Waypoint wood farm in Malchor's Leap. You can gather the wood once every hour per character. Not as good as gold farming then buying the wood, but it offers an easy and brainless farm.

People doing things like making hearts out of commander tags.  Nobody saw the funny side, apart from me.

Mounts should not be able to gain stealth and they should at least add a break bar to mounts if they want to keep them immune to cc.

Who did I antagonise? I just asked who everyone hoped was in the 100 unfortunates...

A lot of people here lent their ears and support, so I’d say this post was far from useless.

DH maybe? But as others said, just dont click using the keyboard is more efficent

No, I read the other comments in this post and saw the same user raising objections to the sexual content of OP's comics and didn't feel like making a separate reply when I could debate them in a single subthread.

Kind of reminds me of the Desert Highlands heart, "Help the Pricklepatch Hollow choya, or don't"  where the usual "You helped the X" message has been replaced with "You helped the choya... for some reason."  This game can be passive aggressive at times... 😁
---
2007 was my time as well to start with gw on my first own pc.
---
Probably my favorite mmo ever. Even the festivals like the celestial festivals were much better than today's events in most mmos. Roller Beatle racing was the shit. 
---
I feel like this would have worked way better as a staff. 
---
So.. Dungeoneering from Runescape
---
I don't think so, as far as I know the guild missions have remained the same since the game released.
---
Nah I just cried to a bunch of people on the internet when I should be taking care of my own problems as incompetent as I am what happens happens
---
Damn 7 tarts wasted haha, well now i know, thank you!
---
I usually keep my eyes on the Commander, so I notice when they go into the siege throwing animation and build what they put down. I'm conservative with spending supply, but newer players might not realize the importance of it all.
---
&gt;Siren’s Landing (A part)
---
Once someone asked for wood farm spots, so I made a map of my Sirens Landing route for him. 
---
https://imgur.com/a/UAxNC7Z
---
It may look like a longer route than yours, but thanks to mounts I only need 2-3 minutes per run and get 60+ elder woods plus ancient trees and some orrian chests.
---
Well I bought both xpacs. So I'm covered there.
---
&gt; Doern Velázquez homeland.
---
this so much please ( I mean all the other ones too, and I wouldn't mind not going to a human centric area for a while )
---
but another human nation somewhere out there ? I'd love to see that
---
If you have a Steam or Xbox controller sitting around, that would probably be your quickest road to recovery.
---
Otherwise, double-check your [mousing ergonomics](https://youtu.be/1xS7EzEKScs) to minimize wear-and-tear.
---
For open-world PvE you could also try a Core-Guardian Hammer-build that stays alive just by auto-attacking, or P/P Thief with Invigorating Precision and Unload set to auto.
---
T4 fractals, raids, PvP, and WvW require active/reactive gameplay and you would probably be better off adjusting your setup instead of simplifying a build.
---
Nothing wrong with reaching out to people. You don't have to take on your problems alone.
---
A lot of things qualify as artificial difficulty, though. Excessive HP damage or OHKOs are artificial difficulty. Punishment over complication.   
---
"Challenge" should come from dealing with multiple mechanics, and that's what instabilities inject into fractals. Problem is, there's still a lack of control over what shows up where, and some instabilities are just kinda bad in relation to GW2's combat style. 
---
Should be, sure. They added a security question, you need a full name of one of your characters.
---

Honestly, what class IS SHE? Necromancer? Mesmer? What’s next, Revenant??

Does all Dailies+Recs actually give you enough pristines for 2 clovers??
---
This indeed completely debunks my theory. But I still got a feeling we will have to kill Kralk in the Mists. And Blish will return. I just hope that whatever happens with Aurene, that it will be epic. Not just an eye opening and ta-da Im alive. Cause that would ruin the last episode.
---
Then you become that guy that always needs help
---
this doesn't seem fun at alll
---
Or just park 10 alts in Malchors and make the same amount with 5% the effort.
---
Honestly what the fuck derpy, how can you complain about those instabilities but not Slippery Slope?! It's the worst instab I've ever seen, probably the worst game mechanic I've ever seen overall
---
Except people get fired (euphemism is "let go") because a company mismanaged itself and needs to cut costs. She volunteered only because it would damage her less than someone else. The ultimate distinction is in the scenario where it was truly a choice to leave the company, she would not have done so.
---
If Birds, Outflanked and Last Laugh are ever a combination for a T4 of anything, it's the only one I'll ignore. Only on rare circumstances if Last Laugh is replaced with Adrenaline Rush.
---
You could use Discord
---
That's when you put that big ole Apple on your head and power them through a few zones
---
Seems like a perfectly normal thing to do. Crab might have a side quest.
---
You will need obscene amounts of elder wood and mithril. I mean like really really really insane amounts. Start buying now. It would take years to farm it yourself. You will need 250 x (Crystalline Ingot, Amalgamated Gemstone, Mystic Coins). You will be spending a lot of money so just take your time.  Anet made sure that the gen 2 leggies are massive gold sinks. 
---
. 
---
You're a pretty bad teacher if you honestly think any of those will work, instead of having the opposite effect of making them do it more often.
---
But it's still relevant to GW2 by virtue of featuring a playable race and class.  Saying there must be something more substantial than the "suggested universe" is just moving the goalposts.  It doesn't have to be highbrow humor, and you don't have to enjoy it.  But it's still GW2 related.  The fact that you personally don't like it won't change that.  No one is forcing you to view anyone's content.  You can even block people so you won't see their posts at all.
---
"We Bleed Fire," on Mai Trin yesterday was really rough for pugs.  I think, "Dodging is a DPS loss," really needs to be addressed.  Many of the newer instabilities really tax healers, and if you over-tax your healer then you're probably going to down or die.  The sad part, at least during Mai Trin, is that whether it's the cannon shots or the WBF procs you have enough endurance regeneration to dodge about 70-80% of the blasts with Fractal pots.  Taking unnecessary hits makes healing a lot less fun and a lot more stressful.  
---
Lol
---
More or less
---
Alicia Keys
---
There should be an emote  sent to the log or chat and the siege should have an owner name attacked to it. Same thing when you pull tactics. You should have a requirement  to pull them and something sent to map chat that can be seen like damage in your logs so people can look it up. It's as simple as that. Anet rarely does anything but at least we'd know who was doing it.  
---
Which...still requires you to open Black Lion chests...
---
Revenant as a whole I think as long as they are using the ventari stance.
---
Maybe, but there are already a *ton* of really cool staffs. Let the other weapons get some neat stuff occasionally.
---
I was super pumped, worked hafor it, thought it would complete my nature themed sylvari ranger with fern hound, but the visuals were a let down, and i did do a forum thread but it barely got 2 responses, them being: “lol who cares” and “not gem store, they dont care”.
---
Exactly what has she done for community interaction in GW2 though? GW1, sure did a lot. Not much from her in GW2
---
A lot of the stuff that happened to fractals in the last year or so feels that way. Deepstone wasn't great, Siren's Reef is a lot worse and the new instabs have done a good job sucking the fun out of the other fractals, too. It's *great* fun when only the weekends are left for your little group of fractal runners and you get cancer instabs, especially in the CMs.
---
&gt; The weirdos come out
---
...and start obsessively objecting to non-prudish things posted on the Internet.
---
ventari (with ventari line) isnt perma either without substantial boon duration (because energy limitations) and only affects 5 targets; also have to run ventari as a legend; which sucks
---
That is not true. I'm not saying human story is still not the fastest BUT :
---
If the human story was the fastest overall considering travel between location and the time to do a story instance + cinematic it could still have been a story with shorter instance time but that wasn't worth doing mainly because of the travel time between location. 
---
However, with mounts now, the travel time is overall less impactfull because it represents less time now compare to the instance part.
---
Also, some mounts (like griffon and springer) could allow you to make "huge skip" .
---
So again, not saying human story is still not the fastest, but it could potentially be another story.
---
"GERT DEMMED KRABS! THEY ARE EVERYWHERE! KILLING POOR BANDITS WHI NEVER HARMED NO ONE AND UNDERCUTTING US MERCHANTS! ITS A COONSPIRACY I TELL YEE!"
---
&gt; Glad it's not a BL chest exclusive.
---
Well, that's some level of acceptance we as a community have been taught over the years. An item that's so unique that it's close to being a legendary is praised for not being specifically an *RNG* cash-shop item.
---
The best place to start is looking over all the tiers of the recipe on the wiki and see what is needed, and set reasonable increment goals depending on your play style. 
---
Nah, I'm pretty sure [Outside](/r/outside) came up with this [ages ago,](https://i.imgur.com/EFbvm.jpg) and they're the biggest franchise there is.
---
No, you are not alone.
---
Firebrigade stands for Firebrand+Renegade support, which is alternative to Druid + Chrono.
---
&gt; you can also try to train your zerg to shame people for (repeatedly) throwing random siege
---
Nobody learns from this. In fact, this is an open invitation to continue your actions.
---
backcancer on sale
---
Because you can buy the fragments from a vendor.
---
Clovers are attrociously expensive. If you don't mind playing WvW, a full track doesn't take more than a few hours. And it gives you a decent amount of materials and clovers.
---
If the legendary has a collection, the cost of the collection will normally be more expensive than the precursor. If you have the money, it might not be a bad idea to just buy a precursor.
---
An example would be Chuka and Chompawatt. The elder bow staves feel like a down right fuck you.
---
No, last week it was about the desert wind and a sand shade.
---
I think that design might work better for WoW (where you have gear treadmills), but in the case of GW2, I would rather keep all the mechanics in easy mode, and just tune down the damage.
---
So easy mode would be just like normal mode, but with margin to recover after what would be a wipe in normal mode.
---
I hadn't actually heard about that, though 'not any time soon' is quite different from 'definitely not happening'--either way, thanks for the info!
---
You'd hope the griefers get bored and leave after a while. If you're playing a team based game mode and decide to play opposite to what the team wants, what's the point of playing? Surely trolling people out of spite gets boring at some point. 
---
You have to buy the expansions if you want to do endgame content (raids,pvp,WvW). If not then base game is ok. 
---
I suggest TheMightyTeapot and BikZeSnake. Both entertaining
---
If you have any interest in WvW get the clovers this way instead.  I did WvW reward tracks to get the last maybe 40 clovers this time around and I didn't regret it.  Mystic toilet clovers are the WORST part of making a legy 
---
It is, but most of the skill casts are rather fast so it's barely a difference. 
---
I think some people play support build on herald with ventari stance. Possibly, a small number though.
---
I wonder what happened to Naga and Yeti and Tengu and... I want Cantha ok?
---
No, the last one was about a [kid stealing breasts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/b1q6w0/the_bulbous_theft/), you might have missed it because it got removed from this sub.
---
I was gonna post this! 
---
Please, please DON'T stop making these.
---
I park 25 chars there. You get around 20-25 logs per character. I swear it IS the most boring shit in the game. But i got all my wood ready for the next greatsword.
---
yes, like all the years-old wvw issues that resurfaced again due to the popularity of the mount release. it is not unreasonable to expect the latest release, that understandably holds a lot of attention, to get fixes as long as it still enjoys that privilege. *current* content not working as intended makes a worse impression than *old* content not working as intended.
---
there are issues that affect more people, or more greater impact on general gameplay, but if ANet can not even address the issues in current releases, how do you expect them to muster the resources to address older issues that in turn did not get fixed when they were the momentary hotness?
---
Oh. That's pretty bad.
---
i feel this should be front page more
---
They could also just remove the wvw location from the achievement since it's pointless. 
---
And wvw devs are related to that how?
---
i know of many issues that the game has, a simple one like this should be easy to hotfix, many issues have been going on for months and a day or so (most likely much less) to fix this would not make a dent in any time, if any, that is being used to fix the other issues.
---
yeah, it's a good thing im not filled with hate :) 
---
Jokes on you, she has multiple characters that all appear exactly the same. Why play a mesmer when you can make your own?
---
for my kudzu it took me a couple years because i went pretty slowly with it. work on map completion first, and then start doing the precursor crafting. save up your mats and do reward tracks to get clovers and obsidian
---
&gt; Most Spanish-speaking players I know actually play in English
---
Because the translation is pure garbage, and not just bad taste with the unique names, but huge constant context mistakes as well, like it was done with google translate or something like that.
---
Also, you'll always find more and better resources if you just look for something in English anyway.
---
I realise that not all art is meant for everyone, but this is a specific subreddit which should only contain relevant stuff.
---
That said, a grey pointy-eared girl with a clone of herself contemplating some hot action is only really relevant *because* it's posted in this sub.
---
If someone goes "Hi, I'm definitely in and from Tyria!" a then takes that character into whatever scenario, then yeah, that's where I draw the line. Sure there's the clone and a droid of sorts, but neither are unique for GW2. That only leaves a very small-eared Asura (do you know how much Asura care about ears?) to tie it to the game, which to me makes it look as low-key spam for lack of other interested crowds. 
---
Maybe it's just because I haven't followed OP at all, but good luck using that excuse to any new redditor that happens to only see stuff like this.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
As for blocking, no. I'm not a little bitch, if I don't want to see their content, I can just not click the thread. Maybe the next one is actually enjoyable to me, who knows! 
---
I just wanted to spark somewhere of a discussion but unfortunately I mostly get downvoters who lost their tongue. Let OP draw all they want, but I don't see this sub as a good place for everyone to start spamming the daily ponderings of their fictional Tyrian characters, comic format or not. 
---
It's probably easer just to change the area that applies No mounts to affect only the puzzle and the entrance, but not the rooms.
---
Me too!
---
Oh, looked them up on the wiki and it didn't seem like you could.  Makes sense, then.
---
Ooh, does that mean that you get higher range with slow? 
---
Surely that cannot be abused to treb objectives from far away~
---
Hm, if it's really 20-25 elder wood logs then that seems slightly more profitable than the \~15 iron ore I get from the rich node in Brisban. I might have to re-locate some character on my main account.
---
Brisban is great for alt accounts though, I don't have that many tomes of knowledge on those accounts and level 10 is enough for the iron pickaxe.
---
There's still a lot of spanish players in-game. This fan-site was just dead for a long time, so they maybe decided to close it.
---
We may not be the highest community of the game, but we're still a big part of it. We'll be on a true problem when they start to release content without translating it to Spanish.
---
Siege skills are skills that basically 'order' the siege machine to do stuff, and they are tied to the player character, not the siege machine. If your character gets alacrity alacrity, they will recharge faster. But the time it takes for the machine to 'listen' isn't always shorter than player skills, so they will sometimes feel like they are taking their sweet time to turn and do the thing.
---
As far as I can tell, flame reams have short self-recharges, so they will work well with a player with alacrity, and players taking turns to use them. 
---
Don't talk to me or my web comic ever again.
---
Thank you for your kindness :)
---
I used to play GW1 maybe like 8 or 9 years ago.  I just started up again.  I'm trying to buy tomes and lockpicks and more.  I'm making new characters too to get back into the game as I don't remember anything.  So I think I need LOTS of platinum.  And it's for lots of different things.  
---
But I'm not a brand new player in GW1 and I do have some platinum in the game already.  So I wouldn't feel right taking your platinum.  Especially when I can't give you back something in return.
---
But I wanted to write to tell you I appreciate your kindness.  Thank you :)
---
They were exterminated or forced to leave.  Cantha is a bad place for sentient non-humans.
---
Yeah, that is only for the cluster on the statue, sometimes there are 2 or 3 nodes close by and you can pick them up fast. Also, i always have the guild buff and the gathering banner, on some characters i also have the booster but it is not needed i just had like 30 or something in the bank.
---
That's what I really don't understand. The answer I get sometimes is "because the SC benchmark is low". Yes, a benchmark on a golem which doesn't move, doesn't attack and for which you don't need to know the boss mechanics.
---
It was not an LFG for a record run - I wouldn't have joined in that case.
---
Might consider them.. If they were a 3-combo.
---
HahaHAHAHA. it made me laugh. +1
---
What's the post in question?
---
&gt; Though I wouldn't call a mesmer clone "incest"
---
Me neither but thats beside the point. I just wonder why OP felt the need to start up a discussion about incest since it completely distracts from the issue the comic is illustrating (social awkwardness/self-loathing).  This post/comic would have been half-decent if it wasnt for OP`s additional comment.
---
&gt; doesn't really justify not posting it here.
---
I didnt tell OP not to post here, I asked why they only post it here and not on their deviantart profile. It would make sense to post here, if OP was interesting in discussing their art with the community but clearly, that isnt the case because their replies are slim to none. 
---
How about a firebrand build? It can also be an option for me although I don't quite know what the recommended gear is
---
What do you mean by chrono sharing aegis?
---
I should surely find a guild to raid with...
---
I like the time flexibility that the LFG gives me, but sometimes it gets this bad.

Was Lazarus actually in Orr the whole time or did he just run there?
---
I thought I remember back in the day ranked pvp seasons coincided with balance changes. What's the purpose of them now?
---
Give how you described the fractal, "with slippery slope" quite obviously you're here to back slippery slope more than the fractal itself. If it really was just the respawn problem problem then the slippery slope wasn't part of the issue was it? Glad you assumed it was slippery slope problem rather than just a respawn point bug.
---
That's fair, and I'm always thankful for other perspectives. While I didn't have the smoothest life so far, I've lived it in arguably the best region in the world, all factors considered. I try to keep reminding me of that, and hearing numbers like €350/month really helps in making me see the comparison, and that's just an EU country, if my assumption is right. It gets much much worse on our little globe.
---
In any way, I'll suggest what others probably already did: go download it, see if you like the gameplay etc. You won't be able to make as much gold or involve yourself with the community compared to a player who bought at least the core game or 1 expansion, but you'll be able to make well-informed decision whether to commit or not.
---
Also keep an eye out for discounts. If you'll be saving up for a while, just relax and take it slow. One will come eventually and the paywalls are only at certain endgame content, and whatever features/rewards are hidden behind them. You can end up with BiS gear and legendary weapons without paying Anet a single penny, although you'd be farming an ungodly amount while begging RNGesus to hear your prayers (He won't). 2nd best tier is perfectly fine for almost all content, which is easy enough to get if you craft or do dungeons (although they're not very popular these days for relative lack of rewards).
---
The tryhards among us probably won't like core players very much, although in practice, most classes can perform just fine if you know what you're doing.
---
I don't know about other things, but you can always use the installed version instead of the browser version. I think that discord is less stressful to a new user.
---
&gt;Next time I'm going to talk directly with the administrators of Reddit.com website (not this subreddit, the whole reddit.com's admins) for control this behavior, I have now two moderators in the list.
---
I dare you. Good luck.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Inspiring_Distortion
---
Gives everyone aegis when chrono uses f4 or any signet. Used to be expected, but kinda becomes a lost art at this point, with fractal chronos being lazy and having excuses for not running inspiration. 
---
&gt; the Llamacadabra and butterfly rift 
---
@mods. If you really removed a fortnite dance compilation: Thank you very much
---
You cannot put everything people may come up with in lfg. 
---
Some common knowledge and common sense is simply implied by the fact, that 250+li lfg is asking for at least semi-experienced players. 
---
it's quite possible actually in full dps gear if it weren't for that green circle mechanic. So might need to drop dps a bit.
---
I absolutely hate comments like this. Someone makes a thread about a change they would like to see, and at the bottom there is always a comment that says 'no because X is more important so X should be changed first'. 
---
I mean, this is a game discussion forum and OP cared enough to make a thread and discuss, so its important for them. Do you really have to shut it off?
---
I agree 100% - it's still not funny being attacked by people (with the first party of today they were 2-3, probably of the same guild) at the same time just because I'm playing the class I know best and I like best.
---
Fix requires map artist to do the work and proper map geometry changes, not just simple script fixes - meaning that it will require full redeploy, so it's easy to assume it will happen in next full patch (that will probably happen on next tuesday).
---
As you're invidivual you don't have that kind of power to judge my posts as bad as you don't have power to delete my posts. Its just delusion in your head that drives you insane. Word of advice Understanding content as in context is important. 
---
[no u](https://yorkesoftware.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/img_0120.gif)

Yeah, that was weeks ago and really said nothing. So I didn't miss some big communication post or something. That's quite disheartening.
---
but thank you for clearing that up for me.
---
I'm on your side, dumbass.
---
Probably has to do with chrono have piss poor dps when running inspiration. 
---
I myself run it when the group needs it. Generally for the projectile reflect, mostly. The aegis is just a side benefit.
---
I run with a DH who happens to share aegis well.l, though.
---
Tbh i ask necros to leave my squad aswell if they cant swap. 
---
i prefer either higher dps or some with more utility
---
"are you a wizard"
---
&gt; I want Cantha ok?
---
Everybody does
---
You just said there are more important things to be fixed, how is that an accurate explanation? I can make an equally accurate counterplay by saying no.
---
If you're newer to T4 Fractals you're not always going to get a Chrono or a Firebrigade composition.  Scourge and Reaper are great class options with a lot of useful utility ranging from boon-corrupt to barrier and revive potential to great cleave, might generation and solid CC.  I've seen a lot of less experienced players trying to brute force T4 Fractals with pDPS compositions without a source of boon-corrupt or strip.   
---
... which would be fine if "No Pain No Gain," or "Vengeance," weren't such common instabilities these days.  Losing 33% of your compositions DPS means that your phases will be longer and that much of that sweet, sweet burst DPS will be wasted.  Pretty much every week I run into a group without any competent boon-corrupt or boon-strip.  pReaper or cScourge have multiple strip options. 
---
pReaper has Axe 3 &amp; GS4.  cScourge has Scepter 3, Harbinger of Sorrow (new Shroud trait/barrier).  Both classes have access to corrupt boon, an ammo skill (additional source of corruption bleeds too!) which corrupts 3 boons from a target.  Often times when you're playing Chronomancer you'll have to slowly work through cover boons to get at stripping protection.  It's a nuisance.  
---
Scourge is a great starter class for T4s.  It may not be "pDPS," but you've got a ton of useful group utility:
---
* F2 - Condition =&gt; Boon Conversion / Shade + Self. 
---
* F3 - Barrier for allies / Shade + Self. 
---
* F4 - Ranged Revive/Transfusion (Blood Magic) / Shade + Self
---
* Heal = Barrier for struggling allies; bulwark for healing. 
---
* Corrupt Boon, Flesh Golem / extra boon hate + strong cc.  
---
* Decent might generation via Oppressive Collapse (Torch 5) 
---
* Epidemic + Parasitic Contagion - Cleave + Immense Sustain. 
---
pReaper really isn't horrible either.  Reddit loves to circle jerk about optimal conditions that newbies aren't going to experience for a long time.  pReaper provides its own quickness, has great cleaves, can *also* take blood magic and is simple &amp; easy to play.  It's one of the best classes for climbing because it provides a lot of its own might and quickness independent of support classes.

It probably won't make you feel any better, but people have been wrong about necro for years. It used to be the fractals squads that refused to accept the fact that necro DPS is great (and always has been), now it's raid squads.
---
Yeah, pretty much unless you have a Zerg with you
---
Imho you shouldn't be kicked for bringing reaper to wing 1 (or even scourge, although it doesn't work well).
---
There are classes that can do more dps? Sure.
---
Are you not able to clear a raid because you brought a reaper instead of a holo? Then, as someone said, you have bigger problems than class choice.
---
If someone wants to be an elitist, he/she is free to do so. But they should be more precise with their LFG message. There are many ways: "only 30k+ SC builds", "no necro", "only holo or thief", "big dps or kick" or whatever. I wouldn't have joined with a message like that.
---
unfortunately, a good portion of the "exp" players are nothing but massive leeches nowdays, so I don't get either :/
---
Peew.. I also got all worked up like..what the .. ?! I'm spaniard and I'm didn't even know about this thing? :3
---
But, I began with the beta weekends and head start, and I simply went with the usual international sites.. I guess most of us do that.
---
Haha, I guess I'm lucky to not have met that many playing WvW
---
&gt; Reapers are not meant to have massive DPS. They are a control spec meant to be tanky and to pin down enemies.
---
Too bad this role is redundant in PVE and reapers suck in WvW where this might actually be useful. 
---
It's your right to do so - but please, then put it on your LFG. 
---
What's the issue with what I said? You want to play the DPS role right? Then gear as many DPS classes as you can and learn to play them well. I personally don't know how close you can get to the benchmark on your necro so I'm not calling you out on your dps. But also consider how horrible pugs can be even the top dps classes can have shitty dps in the wrong hands and thats a gamble every one takes when the join a pug group. I know  you're angry and felt you needed to make this post but really just raid with a static if you want to play necro. Do you really want to go back to good old days of dungeons LFGs "No necros!"?
---
Hugs to you... I know the horrible feel... While I didn' try to play necro but I was on my reaper when I joined I still remember getting kicked for being necro when I finish writing "I can Chrono tank or druid" then getting invited back because they thought I was going to necro but read me after kicking me...
---
I joined, blocked the commander and the lieutenant who kick me and left... Still, it hurts quite a lot since I love playing my reaper.
---
Reaper shroud is perfectly fine. No reason why you need to copy holosmith onto reaper.  That being said, the numbers and traits dealing with shroud are the problem.   
---
1: Why is there no trait that gives shroud damage reduction. This is literally the first thing i would have made.   
---
2: Why does shroud have so much difficulty with conditions? No cleanse, no default transfer, no  mitigation. I would change the \`transfer 2 conditions on shroud 2' to be built into the skill.   
---
3: the whole 'can't heal in shroud' is bullshit. I wouldn't mind if it put half healing to health, half into shroud, but being stuck at low HP and not being able to drop out of shroud to clear condis is very, very common.   
---
After that it is just numbers.   
---
Had high ping earlier and currently the game is completely inacessible for one of my accounts (error 5:11:3:159:101), but works fine for others.
---
A bit #nobodyasked but I first visited WvW a couple of days ago. Expected to just get the warclaw and be done with it but I found myself joining again after that and I'm having a lot of fun despite dying a lot (I'm a cheapskate so I'm just using my full zerker gear from PvE)
---
I guess I just wanted to sat that if anyone's on the fence about WvW, give it a try.
---
Not with the privacy poilicy you wouldn't.
---
You can install it as described in instructions without uninstall.

https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/wiki/Reporting-crashes stick to this

This is legit af
---
Or at least give us better rewards for suffering through them
---
You're extremely wrong in several things, I recommend you go for pHolo and pReaper logs and look at the DPS graph, particularly the burst peaks and the duration of said peaks.
---
Thing is most Necro players are complete trash at playing Necro 
---
&gt; Alacrity is great, but never use quickness on:
---
Ewh... That's one nasty "feature".
---
*Screenshots
---
Yeah if I'm definitely considering changing my build, I'm just using a GS / Sword+Pistol power chrono (kinda) which works well in open world stuff (what build doesn't?) but it's really squishy with no extra vitality or toughness.
---
I've never actually used voice chat in any game (no mic and I don't play other online games anyway) but I can see it being useful. I wonder why they use TS and not Discord though.
---
 \[&amp;AulPPwEA\]  - Chat code Generators are your frands...
---
Time for crab.
---
Just need to listen. In most voice calls you will often only ever gonna hear 2 dudes, the commander and one random. Everyone else is quite listening. 
---
&gt; d you go for pHolo and pReaper logs and look at the DPS graph, particularly the burst peaks and the duration of said peaks.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Thing is most Necro players are complete trash at playing Necro
---
Calling the generic players of a class 'trash' is complete nonsense. You aren't better just because you play a different class. 
---
The difference in average DPS is a bit over 4k from snowcrow for power vs power. Now, that number seems close, but when you start dropping boons from non-optimal situations, holo really starts pulling ahead. In open world, holo has a much better ability to generate its own boons and Forge's full reset being much faster than reaper's shroud generation really pushes it a lot further than simple benchmarking. 
---
Full ascended trinkets, yes. But these are easy to get. Exotic armor is more than enough. 
---
&gt;If Napoleon was an immortal lich
---
Men only want one thing and it's fucking disgusting
---
Nothing wrong about what you said, I just see it differently. As long as you have certain classes for certain roles in your party, you have enough CC, your dps type (pdps or condi) is right for the boss and you’re experienced enough, you shouldn’t be forced to change DPS class in my opinion, 
---
Yes, at this point I would prefer a “no necros “ LFG than to be kicked. At least I would know that I am not wanted and I would avoid elitist parties :).
---
I don't!
---
haHAA
---
ahoy they fellow sub 1% raider
---
They're like 10% apart, it's great
---
You dont need to talk, just listen. You will survive so much more because you will actually know what is going on.
---
On the TS vs Discord thing. It depends server from server, guild from guild. Some use one, some use the other. TS is actually less hw demanding so that might be one of reasons.

i rarely pve, but my best suggestions is to group up, and communicate
---
the enjoyment comes from smashing towers/keeps after strategic usage of seige and land force. 
---
its the camaraderie that makes me wanna stay alongside with all the salt that the enemy cannot hear. 
---
also, imagine running lootbags. 
---
But does this also work the other way around?
---
Start channeling to get the "normal" bar and get quickness mid-channel.
---
yeah for now i've decided to not buy either of the expansions. i've also been hearing that the game has been dying a bit
---
oh there have been sales where you can buy both for $25? do you have any idea when the next sale might be? 
---
this is a good idea, i'll look into this. thanks!
---
I think its just best to look at Season 3 Episode 6 as the filler beach episode of the series, where the plot doesn't matter.
---
Their sofware is an embedded browser inside a window, basically, which is why it needs the even the GPU to render stuff and it's what lowers the FPS. They should had code it in QT C++ like TeamSpeak did.
---
Nah, Xiuquatl looks way better

Some runes and amulets are locked by default. You don't need to use presets, go take a look at metabattle.com

Who cares about fun anyway.
