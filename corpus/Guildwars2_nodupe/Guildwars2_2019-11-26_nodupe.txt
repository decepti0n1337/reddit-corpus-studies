"sigh" for the hundredth time. ANET DONT HAVE PROBLEMS BECAUSE OF MONEY. Their dev team is big enough. They are still profitable. It is literally entirely due to problems with their developer cycle, not funding. The devs get paid a salary, they wont work harder with more money. They have a team equivalent to ff14. Its not down to low numbers. Stop trying to fleece players because you dont understand how game development works.

If you have access to living story season 3/4/5 there are lots of stat selectable options there. [Check the gearing guide for specifics](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character).

The waypoint unlocks will be handy for an alt. Otherwise meh, but free is free, no real complaint there.

Gorilla is a southern spirit, it isn't from shiverpeaks.

---
Gorilla, minotaur, dolyak, otter, bunny, frog, griffon, mink, wurm, ... there's lots of  'lesser' spirits that are still around.
---
&gt;I think the game encourages this mentality where "viable" replaces "optimal" for casual players. 
---
I'm not sure what you mean by that? Maybe I have different definitions for viable and optimal, but I don't have a problem with people running non-optimal yet viable builds, especially if it's training. I've run my share of raid training runs and don't ask too much besides having the right kind of gear (berserker's for power, viper's for condi, etc.) for your build and at least full exotics with some ascended. I don't care too much about minmaxing (e.g. using a few assassin's pieces to get to 100% crit chance is awesome but not required, and infusions are definitely optional) or getting ~~an alacrigade, a Chrono/quickbrand, a banner warrior, a ranger spotterslave, and spamming the rest with guardians~~ the optimal team comp, as long as the important roles are all covered and nothing's actively causing problems (like someone having more toughness than the tank, having two sets of banners, or your example of the Chrono putting wells in death pools...or just people being jerks). But I might be more patient than a decent amount of hardcore players, and I'm definitely one of the more casual hardcore players, mostly just wanting to have fun without worrying about getting optimal results out of anyone else but (sometimes) myself or getting the best gold-per-hour (plus I don't do CMs that much, so that limits my hardcoreness, I suppose).
---
&gt;Meanwhile, you have burnt out veterans that settle for competent, "good enough" gameplay vs. "optimal gameplay," that are shamed by the 01%.
---
I definitely get that, although I've also had both good and bad experiences with the 1%. I think part of the issue is that there's not much of a middle ground area (in-game) for people between completely casual and the 1% superhardcore. 
---
At least speaking from a raider's perspective, it's not exactly the most welcoming sight to look in lfg (which is where many if not most casual players will look first to start getting into raids and likely get turned off and stop there instead of looking online to find Discords and other resources) and see nothing but "must have 1000 kp, 2000 li, legendary armor, Izanagi's Burden, Recluse, Gjallarhorn, 750+ credit score, a C.V. with attached cover letter, and a partridge in a pear tree." Meanwhile, the casual players who join those anyway (because there's no other apparent way that they see to start raiding) and severely bring down hardcore players who are trying to get optimal speedruns are both giving other casual players a bad name but also coming back with bad experiences of hardcore players, which is where a lot of the stereotypes about how "casuals don't know nor care about how to play" and how "hardcore players are elitist" come from. 
---
While the strike missions are a step in the right direction (especially the new one, I actually had some really good conversations with casual players who wanted to know how to win fast enough to get the gold bonus), they could use their own dedicated spot in lfg (especially if they're going to have the public option for only the most recent strike), and the raids lfg page could be split into a page that says something like "raids," "raids - hardcore," or "raids - challenge mode," and one that says something like "raids," "raids - casual," or "raids - training." That way, there's an in-game space for casual players looking to get into raids while the 1% superhardcore players have their own space to get groups together for optimal runs without worrying about a casual player wandering in, having trouble, and bringing things down. All the while those of us between casual and superhardcore can switch between the two depending on whether we want a hardcore run or something more casual (or they could have three pages, one for training/casual runs, one for CMs/hardcore runs, and one for the rest, but I think at least splitting CM/hardcore from training/casual is a good step, everything else is just bonus).
---
Catering to the "hardcore" demographic is definitely harder than the casual one due to the inherently smaller population of a specialist vs more generalised title. 
---
With that said, I don't believe that you can't make niche/hardcore games that are successful without having to also cater to casual players. It's just a delicate balancing act with the target demographic needing to be more understanding and aware of the stakes involved.
---
Well it’s like I said. I’ve come to the sad realisation that gw2 isn’t for me. Which is why I’ve quit. But to me it has so much potential and could be so much more

[ARENA NET] [Rubi Bayer.8493 posted on 2019-11-25 23:09:16](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/1105123#Comment_1105123):
---
&gt; Hi all, I have some more news for you. Like I mentioned in [last week's post](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/1099265/#Comment_1099265 "last week's post"), we had a list of updates we felt confident we could start working on and planned to give you an update on that list early in the new year. That has changed because one of the updates to build and equipment templates will be ready earlier than expected.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt;We've been working on an update that will automatically switch your build and equipment templates when you enter or exit PvE, WvW, or PvP. The game will remember which build and equipment template tabs were last active when you return to a game mode.
---
&gt;Also, PvP equipment will be integrated into all Equipment Templates, which will bring all of your equipment management into one convenient place. Our current plan is to add a new button to the equipment menu to view the PvP equipment slots in each template. By doing this, it means you to be able to manage your PvP equipment whenever you like, even outside of PvP game modes. Because PvP equipment is very different from normal inventory items, it will not take any space away from your standard equipment.
---
&gt;This update to Build and Equipment Templates will go live on December 3. We'll still follow with another update early in the new year.
---

---
Its more than that, as well.  Fewer players doesn't just mean fewer people to make content and such, but it means ANet makes less money.  The less money ANet gets out of GW2, the less time they'll be able to put into it until it just stops being financially viable and NC closes the servers down.  Hardcores and casuals need one another, just as a software company needs both engineering *and* sales.  A little friendly ribbing and piss-taking is fine, but when you start actively resenting one another, shit starts goin downhill *real* fast.
---
&gt;I'm pretty sure the better game and actual clone (but different) has a bigger fanbase than Literallywho?
---
uh yeah. that's what I said.
---
That’s a good point. I think rewards in general are a problem in gw2
---
The smaller playerbase means less incoming money, which results in less content being produced. It's probably not theoretically impossible to get by, since you also only have to produce that hardcore content, but it's less realistic than a more general approach, since you can reuse assets between targeted playerbases (which is something ArenaNet is absolutely awful at).
---
[deleted]
---
I mean it’s not an angry rant. It’s more of a ramble but yeah you make a good point maybe it is too early to judge. Question is how long is it now between the next strike mission and how much will it improve

"I've quit but I'm sticking around to talk down the game instead of just moving on" post well I haven't seen one of these in a while but to be fair other people hide it better. You've quit good for you Anet aren't changing their model if it still makes them money they are a business and people from my understanding like the content the problem with this episodes content was too short at least most posts I've seen have complained about this. The map is awesome from Jormag whispering to you throughout the map yes the events could use some work hopefully Anet take that on board and in episode 2 when they expand the map. The meta could use some work but maybe its easy now and like with the Silverwastes meta it will expand when Drakkar releases. The strike missions are harder I've only hit gold once for it hopefully the other 2 are like the first one. The rewards needs sorting out though. The story is the best they have done so far I loved the season 4 story the sense of scale especially at the end but the lovecraftian thing they are going for in this season has impressed me so far. Now if they can do an episode every 2 months there would be more content going into the game next year.
---
Also the main point is when will we next have an expansion? When will we next have a raid? When it’s been a year since last fractal
---
This is just good news. Not gonna spin it or add a comment about what I'm still salty about. Glad to see they're pushing this out.
---
The Sale values are too low. Because this is just data and you don't have any actual production costs or stock limitations (just the development cost), you could discount by a massive margin such as exceeding 50% and try to bait consumers into a feeding frenzy of account upgrades. Most of these sale values make me think "I don't need it now, and I won't need it later."
---
Is there any way to get the Aquatic Murk for Dusk from the fractal without having to go in every day and hope that I get lucky with the path? Currently it's supposed to swap every day but it's still the same as before reset and it's literally the last thing I need for my legendary.
---
i love how the first response to the dev is someone asking if they can turn off the thing everyone has been asking for
---
I am worse
---
Can't be worse than me.
---
By that logic, every new LS episode should be a tutorial AND a summary of the story up to now. 
---
You do realize it’s not really logical, right? At some point you gotta draw the line and give responsibilities to the player to do things in order for his own sake.
---
&gt;We're doing OK without you, wouldn't stress about it :)
---
And here we see in the wild the audience Gw2 panders to. The reason it's failing: Toxic Casuals.
---
Witness its hostile behavior, hatred to raiders, and contrarian attitude to defend every bad decision.
---
Forgive me for caring about a game I’ve put 5000 hours into and wish for it to improve and for looking for a reason to come back because I want a reason to come back. The story has improved you can tell but where is the 5 man content. Strike missions have potential but how long till they actually get there? When’s the next raid? When’s the next expansion is there even going to be a new expansion, is there even going to be another raid? The last fractal was nearly a year ago now? Story is good. Strike missions have potential but can’t replace raids dungeons and fractals all this with no answers or communication from anet
---
MOB happened. When Colin left.
---
The fact that a significant group of players sticking around and voicing their input should tell ANET something. Granted that most input these days are negative, but still they haven’t given up that maybe ANET will take things into consideration. They still have a large group of players who love this game, they ought to be doing more to build those relationships with the community than alienating them.
---
This is a good first step.
---
One of many that still need to happen for the system to be serviceable.
---
So beautifully, wonderfully, fantastically, stupidly silly. 🤣
---
The esports focus was a mistake from the beginning.
---
Well, you've got a 50% winrate on ranked, thats indeed garbage tbh🤔
---
Wouldn't Ogden have more of a staff than a hammer?
---
It doesn't help when the rares and most sought items are extremely rare drops from those annoying chests scattered though the game that spawn some enemies when you open them.
---
Not from the treasure chests, not from the metas, from the achievement chests like dwarven chest, bleached bones and whispers supplies.
---
It's nice we already have that requested change, especially one the one point where templates originally removed QoL.
---
Also I'm pretty happy to know that PvP equipment system, which we already knew were going to be merged into templates, is done in the way that is described here. It means no equipment template slot loss (which we were afraid of), and gives value to equipment templates (the 2 free ones, or the ones you may buy) : each of them now holds both a pve/wvw gear set *and* a pvp template (as long as we use same weapon choice, or change weapons manually like we used to).
---
Well at least that makes me feel better xD. I do think their matchmaking is garbage though tbh.
---
You might think he wants to hate this game, but people like him (and me) actually want to love it, they actually want to see its player base and quality increase. This is like the worst possible way to react to OP.
---
Are you playing Scourge? Reaper? Or core?
---
Its a step in the right direction and good to arrive soon but i wont spend a single gem on those "Templates" as long as my build tabs are the same in wvw/pvp/pve. Make one tab essentially 3 and i MIGHT consider buying them. Make them actually accountbound unlocks rather than characterbound nonsense and i'll most definetely spend some bucks.
---
Yeah. You're definitely not going to be a breakout (financial) success with a niche title. You're likely going to have to rely on the audience being aware that it's either what they have now or nothing at all; thusly are more willing to excuse certain actions (or lack of), and be more generous with their purchasing than they would otherwise.
---
In my assessment, ArenaNet's biggest problem is precisely the opposite: Their attempts to engage multiple audiences outside of what has become their core demographic across the game's history. Trying to chase eSports was a big waste of effort for a game with zero viewability for instance. Adding raids when they were already struggling to support the 3 distinct modes they had was again a mistake. Jack of all trades, master of none if you will.
---
&gt; It kind of makes sense for norn to cover their upper body so little, when they are so tall few things can hit them up there
---
Male Norn: "Don't cover your boobs, you're so tall no one can reach them"
---
Female Norn: "What about arrows?"
---
Male Norn: "..... Ok, pasties only"
---
&gt;Raids. Raids aren’t evil or elitest fam
---
no ty . bye-. there are so many game raid centered. find one and have fun
---
Can you make a bullet list of you points summarized? I'd like to hear your thoughts but I really don't have time to read a massive rant.
---
Or...it just works on adjusting your ranking where it thinks you should be compared to the rest of players.
---
That being said, I had similar situation in one of previous seasons, basically single time where my ranking dropped by hundred, while I just got back to my original one just after and kept there over time...So maybe it is sometimes just bad luck. Or playing at nights with bots :D
---
There's a lot of wasted potential in this game. Raids, dungeons, good metas, WvW and PvP, these are the cornerstones of group content in MMOs and Anet is letting them rot. That's the whole reason I play this genre - teamwork with other players to achieve something great. And here we are today, getting drip-fed a single player RPG with the occasional multiplayer element.
---
I want to believe it was just the mismanagement leading up to the layoffs that caused this to happen, and maybe we have yet to see the fruits of the restructuring. But I think the slow death of everything not related to the main story caused some significant damage to the game and its community and I'm worried that might be beyond repair.
---
I would say the problem with difficulty was more that you kinda needed elite specs, as they were much stronger than core back than. Furthermore the best condi stat (viper) or boon (commander and minstrel) took time for people to get. So the first thing you had to do was get a hell lot of hero points (400back then). I don't remember how many points of 10-value you had to get, but I guess almost all of them. It was HoT that introduced healers and supporters, but the lack of those beforehand meant that people had first get to them. So playing through the maps to actually play the maps. Kinda like all the masteries were. 
---
Some adjustments were certainly needed, but the difficulty was reduced to much.
---
"Do norn women wear fur thongs?"
---
&gt; Because PvP equipment is very different from normal inventory items, it will not take any space away from your standard equipment.
---
So, we are in essence getting a 3rd equipment loadout, just for PvP?
---
Yeah the weird part for me is that all season long I was doing ok. Usually won 7 out of 10 games but the last couple of days has been really bad for me. Idk. I do agree I shouldn't be in upper gold but then why place me there every season? Lol idk.
---
If I was a gambling person, I'd be willing to bet that they're the kind of a player that plays the same build in all 3 gamemodes, to their and their team's detriment.
---
Amusingly enough, the eSports push post-HoT actually more than paid for itself by their own metrics. The reason it stopped was because Grouch got poached by Amazon, and they never replaced him. His responsibilities got absorbed by a few other people or just didn't get replaced at all. Was it a huge, massive eSport? No, but it was more effective than most of the marketing shit they pull.
---
And while I agree that they irritated a lot of players by seemingly leaving them hanging in regards to content, I disagree that the attempt was wrong. The main issue stemmed from a lack of reusing assets. For example, the raid bosses don't have to be unique enemies with new areas. They literally could have just been story bosses with more mechanics. That would also make it easier to get the more casual players into raids, as the mechanics and bosses aren't totally unfamiliar. It also solves the problem people have of not wanting raids to have new lore.
---
They basically treated each game mode as a separate game, which is just bad resource management.
---
1996 was a good year for the game tho.
---
The shift I'm talking about happened way before elite specializations were added. I'm not sure you replied to the right comment.
---
Join the club. There is no way to practice without losing a bunch.
---
I agree and know exactly how you feel. I do hope it’s just the effect of the layoffs and like you said maybe we haven’t seen the fruits of the restructuring yet and for the sake of the game we’ve got more to come. Even if I never play again. I really do hope this games stays around And I find a reason to come back
---
It sounds like your 2 pve/wvw slots will also be 2 pvp slots, so 4 slots total if you are looking at it that way.
---
Colin Johanson left Anet. That was the point from which the company started going downhill.
---
Aye. It’s either basic greens and rares that you salvage or super fucking rare (but cool) item that you Have less chance of getting than winning the lottery rare and no in between
---
4 of the games are at least within ~ 100 points.  I consider that the sort of margin of error.  If you had won those 4 then you'd be at 50% for 5/10.
---
Yes! I can get more charcter slots. Now i just hope for the number of characters you can have will be raised and everything is perfect :)
---
True. But it's gotten progressively worse. So either I'm not keeping up with how good people are or I'm really just getting worse haha
---
Take my r/angryupvote you beautiful bastard.
---
Reaper. Tried core and that wasn't fun or effective for me. I always played FB, DH, and core guard as well.
---
This is how I took it but her wording is kind of confusing.  Its nice that it won't take up normal equipment place but I hope that part isn't confusing in terms of UI.
---
Some of them look too much like painted toys, but overall I quite like it, especially the shield and the mace.
---
I dunno if you’ve been following controversies surrounding blizzard for the past year, including decisions within WoW, Blizzard’s staff, and then stuff related to China... but suffice it to say, blizzard is fucking up way worse than Anet, so by all accounts, if the GW2 reddit community were ever correct about how companies should carry themselves, Blizzard should be a dead fish floating in the water by now.
---
I would seriously take the opinions made by redditors in regards to GW2 with not just a grain, but probably a whole rock of salt.
---
The way I think it'll work is that equipment loadouts will now contain both gear items and PvP gear selections (runes, sigils, amulets). In PvE and WvW they will continue to work as usual, but in PvP in addition to changing the equipped items (which, except from weapons, are basically there just for cosmetics in PvP) it will also change your PvP gear selections like you used to do manually in the current PvP Build panel. I would be surprised if the latter (panel) would now be retired. Oh wait, Stronghold hero selections are still in there! Eh, wouldn't be surprised if ANet would forget about them.
---
You're not getting worse, you're just being paired against better players. It happens
---
They said it will be hideable with a button, so I'm hooeful about the UI part.
---
The first question I ask when someone tells me they have nothing to do in this game is, "What are you *not* doing?"  followed by "How many hours are you/have you put into the game?" Generally speaking, people either ignore entire aspects of the game or they are 8+ hours/day gamers.
---
I don't understand why people have to be so toxic about it though. It's just a game.
---
Hadn't considered that. Good point.
---
All they think about is money now... English and grammar are nothing lol
---
Yeah I agree. I don't really care if I win or lose since I still get the rewards I want. It just takes longer. I wish I was just better at PvPing just so i don't feel like I'm dragging others down.
---
the power of flex tape
---
You can take the level 80 boost and try it in the silverwastes, it has a "trial stage" where you can experiment freely and change your mind before actually consuming it for good. The gear you get and everything is temporary until you fully consume it.
---
Mobs in the SW hit somewhat harder so it'll be an ok test, despite the fact that the gear itself is usually very tanky.
---
Yeah talking to people on here and in Heart of the Mists has shown me it's not just me
---
...or...people can just...you know...use the dodge key.
---
Don't want to seem rude but how did you manage this?
---
MAKE VIDS YOU CUTIES
---
nice boss. did with 2 accounts. harder than former one and much harder then first one in other zone.
---
did not get some mechanic but we did the same with gold after a wipe first time since we were too self secure looking at hp bar-
---
avarage players will find this much harder without the proper damage reduction and will take them too much if they are too defensive but gold means nothing since there is no drop but the 2 chest with materials
---
My recollection was that leveling up to cap was very fun and friendly to casual players, and as soon as you hit cap there were essentially only hardcore activities. Most of the people that fell in love with the leveling gameplay didn’t want was offered at cap. Most MMOs have this to some degree, it was just magnified for Wildstar.
---
If this were true mobile gaming wouldn't be as lucrative as it is.
---
...or maybe...instead of buying a whole bunch of equipment and build slots for each gamemode, they want to always be manually adjusting their templates according to their choice of gamemode.
---
Why? Its all about esports right now in online games. Even wow (mmorpg) does it. It's better to have some niche esport than nothing.
---
Could find some use in making some tradional norn lookout
---
Yeah, I wouldn't think they'd go lower than that already discounted price.
---
The internet in a nutshell, right there.
---
Ok, bye.
---
Anytime the game content is lacking we get quality memes. This is the way.
---
Cya o/
---
&gt;Amusingly enough, the eSports push post-HoT actually more than paid for itself by their own metrics.
---
I must admit I'm curious as to what that constitutes. From what I remember the viewership was pitiful even by minor eSports standards.
---
&gt;The main issue stemmed from a lack of reusing assets. For example, the raid bosses don't have to be unique enemies with new areas. They literally could have just been story bosses with more mechanics. That would also make it easier to get the more casual players into raids, as the mechanics and bosses aren't totally unfamiliar.
---
The problem with that approach is it places unreasonable design constraints on either mode. Either you have to shoehorn in set-piece bosses into LS instances, while also making design allowances to accommodate the 10scale version. Or, you continue as usual and end up with low quality raids. It's not a magic bullet by any means, and I'd tend to believe that art assets are generally low on the list of allocated developer time for raids to begin with.
---
&gt;It also solves the problem people have of not wanting raids to have new lore.
---
The objection was never that raids shouldn't have lore, just that if lore *was* going to be embedded in them instead of a "hey go kill this dude" setup like bounties, then a story mode should be provided.
---
The problem was when raiders lost their shit at such a suggestion, even when it was explicitly stated that such a mode could completely exclude raid rewards. Rather than voicing their support for it in solidarity.
---
&gt;They basically treated each game mode as a separate game, which is just bad resource management.
---
The problem is they basically are. At least as WvW and PvP are concerned, while raids are still ultimately an extension of PvE, the need for separate balance illustrates as much. While WvW and PvP definitely don't have the ability to stand on their own, they would absolutely benefit from not having to co-exist within the same framework.
---
&gt; You don't get to demand anything as you paid for the product as it was when you got it with no promise of it getting anything else beyond that. You are still failing to realize that if you don't sit back and let the devs do "Keep the lights on" kinds of work as well, then it makes it harder, many times impossible if it goes on long enough, to implement features that players want.
---
Here's the thing: I *get* what you're saying. I understand devs needing time and room to breathe and fix things. Believe me, I speak as a teacher and I've had my fair share of everyone in existence breathing down my neck. What I'm also saying is that no one is going to give them that time. There isn't an MMO in the market that can say "Yo guys, we won't be releasing any new content for the following year while we work on all the issues we have with the engine and whatnot" and survive that year without having some other source of revenue to keep the lights on. 
---
Also, ANet is far from being this innocent snowflake suddenly hounded by people wanting a million things while everything around them breaks down. They're the one who let this technical debt get this high. They're the ones who are completely inept at communicating with their player base before everyone and their moms is already so frustrated and angry at being completely ignored that they don't even want to listen anymore. Which, if you think about it, are the same issue served two different ways: ignoring problems that could be somewhat easy to deal with and letting them become huge snowballs.
---
I suppose that's one way to get the player base to give them the time they need: have no players left besides the truly loyal ones.
---
Gw2 esports was fine. Maybe small but still better than nothing. It failed because Anet stopped supporting it. As you can see on WoW's example that you don't have to be top1 esports game to be still successful.
---
The bear skill was very overpowered for a while in GW1 tbf...
---
I thought it was a fun mix of mechanics.  Had some downs, but overall did well.
---
I liked it switching modes to a familiar boss we had before and thought it was a nice touch, for practicing what you've learned but slightly harder.
---
Doesn't seem too bad, it'll go smoother once people have ran it a bit, we missed out on gold by like 10 seconds on our group (10 random people) on our first try.  
---
  
---
[Video Link](https://youtu.be/kaiS9Divf_E) if anyone wants to check it out.
---
One step closer to doing map completion again. Which I've been putting off for like 3 years.
---
It wasn't fine, viewership continually went down and was not high to begin with. Anet stopped it because of that.
---
*tosses it on the pile*
---
Woah!  
---
I love the style.
---
Players in this game can be really really allergic to help. I had a core player who brought the expansion came into HoT. He is complaining how he is dying nonstop. He said he is necromancer. So i told him the problem is probably on his gear and builds and offered to fix it for him. Instead he just blew up and started bitching about how he won't listen from hardcore players. 
---
Like -.- i hadn't even cleared a single raid wing and hadn't gone beyond Tier 2 in Fractals despite just having my 6th birthday on my first toon.
---
Shiverpeas has got me rolling lol. Thanks for making my day 😁
---
Oh, I'm sorry.
---
I just thought that...that was the goal of strike missions (based on ANet's description). To ease people into raids and other challenging group content...which includes self-improvement.
---
Say the game is fine financially (recent history says otherwise, but OK). Currently they are prioritizing their resources toward the cash shop because that's what makes them money. If the actual game content made them money they would put more resources toward that, and then maybe we'd actually have content worth playing for longer than an hour every few months.
---
&gt;I'm curious as to what that constitutes.
---
They have metrics to match views, click throughs, and the like to expected profit. When added up, the views and clicks generated by Pro League more than paid for itself. Grouch only told us that as a general statement, though, so I don't actually have the specifics.
---
&gt;The problem with that approach is it places unreasonable design constraints on either mode.

Design the boss with the 10 man raid in mind. Remove mechanics or reduce their penalty for a 10 man story mode, and again for the living story instance. I understand it's not so simple that a couple sentences on reddit could solve the problem, but there are a *LOT* of wasted resources in the game because you only see them once.
---
&gt;The problem was when raiders lost their shit at such a suggestion
---
It was a minority of raiders against such a suggestion to begin with, and most of the ones that were against it just thought it would make raid releases take even longer to release. I still think it would be a good idea, which is why I suggested the same, but I don't think you're being honest with yourself if you think the reason it wasn't added is because some raiders took issue with it.
---
&gt;The problem is they basically are.
---
I mean in regards to stuff like Raids/Fractals/Dungeons/etc. Major story bosses can be reused for raid bosses or fractal CMs. Stuff like that. Most of what PvP needed was just more frequent balance updates. Even if they weren't well thought out, it's better than the same meta for literal years as they slightly tweak things a couple times a year. Firebrand/Scourge/Mirage/Thief + FotM Home Node was the required meta for anything competitive for sooooo long. Another example from Pro League is the bunker Chrono that appeared in Season 1. It took literally every Pro League team asking for a balance patch for them to even put a balance patch halfway through the season. That shit should have been hotfixed. I played a lot of WvW, but spread out over the years. I don't really know the WvW community well enough to comment on how that should have been taken care of better.
---
I remember it being marketed as a raiding game, though. While it may have turned off the casual playerbase when they hit that wall, it shouldn't have affected the playerbase who actually wanted that kind of content.
---
Lookin on the bright side. I like that.
---
Okay am most of an open world casual player myself, but this is a dangerous mindset. I agree there aren't many raiders by percentage and at this point certainly, not a lot of PvPers by percentage. There aren't a lot of dungeon runners as a percentage of the population either....but...
---
When you add up raiders and dungeon runners and PvPers and WvWers, you probably do have a significant group of people. Anet has disenfranchised more than one smaller group. Together, they might represent a group that's larger than you think. They might not too, I don't know. But I wouldn't assume that they don't.
---
Really? Season 3 was the weakest GW2 has ever been in my opinion, and a lot of the problems we have stem from that time - poor communication, uninspiring living world releases etc.
---
Season 4 was much better, and that was under Mike Z's direction. While it's still an unknown, I at least like the idea of the Icebrood Saga compared to seasons 3 and 4 (time will tell if it works out).
---
And lets not forget that MO was responsible for the massive layoffs that resulted in the loss of tons of great devs.
---
I look at the quality of the cash shop items versus the items you can actually earn in the game and I'm not so sure.
---
You and Noxxi are the real reason I keep playing.
---
Nah. It's a case of a player who accepted the fact he can't be anything more than a casual but is still salty about others being able to do more stuff - "Well if i can't have it, no one should be able to !"
---
How are you receiving these updates. I would like to receive them too. Aiming for a bag slot 😁
---
Except without the launch Orr "Ranger pets draw aggro just by existing!" feature. I still have horrible memories of that...
---
Between repairs and revives... they make up the bulk of junk in my bank.
---
I think the idea is that you first try it with 10 pugs; you succeed; but then 1 of them has to go; so you do it with 9; and succeed. until you weed out the 5 casuals and are left with your usual fractal group able to clear it.
---
if 2 groups go through this process you end up with 1 full raid group; running a mirror comp.
---
ugly and bland
---
What's the current maximum number of characters?
---
i have been following them and they haven't been fucking up as bad as anet lol. the whole china thing will blow over, blizzard is more competent than anet so they will find a way to straddle the line between shitty behaviour / mechanics while still managing to actually keep their players, which they have a lot more of by far, they can afford to make a few mistakes, *especially* since the release of classic wow. i will take your opinion with a mountain of salt, do not worry.
---
&gt;I would make raids part of the main story
---
You know how I dealt with this in other MMOs that had the final boss fight behind a dungeon or raid? I didn't do the final boss fight and moved on to the next zone.
---
Raiding/ fractal/ WvW/ PvP players have consistently failed to convince non-players that spending our play time with them is worth the effort and build resources. Those modes will forever be back burner stuff until they start acting cool. Kvetching on Reddit, Twitch, YouTube, and the forums? Coming up with ways to force non-players into those game modes? Opposite of cool.
---
&gt;What I'm also saying is that no one is going to give them that time. There isn't an MMO in the market that can say "Yo guys, we won't be releasing any new content for the following year while we work on all the issues we have with the engine and whatnot" and survive that year without having some other source of revenue to keep the lights on.
---
And I get that. What I'm saying is that those players don't get to complain about bugs/issues due to technical debt while, at the same time, not wanting them to stop/slow work on features/content to fix the very bugs that they complain about. It's a simple realistic limitation.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt;Also, ANet is far from being this innocent snowflake suddenly hounded by  people wanting a million things while everything around them breaks  down. They're the one who let this technical debt get this high. They're  the ones who are completely inept at communicating with their player  base before everyone and their moms is already so frustrated and angry  at being completely ignored that they don't even want to listen anymore.  Which, if you think about it, are the same issue served two different  ways: ignoring problems that could be somewhat easy to deal with and  letting them become huge snowballs.
---
1. I never said ANet was blameless in this case, however, customer demand drives the business and the gaming business is notorious for *not* fixing technical debt because they get their payment largely upfront. The problem is the fault of both the players and the business no understanding that technical debt *needs* to be addressed.
---
2. As for technical debt getting this bad, there will *always* be technical debt. End of story. The players, business, and NCSoft need to all let the devs address it. If they don't, then *none of them* get to complain when it comes and bites them in the ass.
---
3. The type of communication the player base wants is actually very, very rare as it is. There's a reason that companies like GGG get held up for their communication - because they are among the few that do.
---
4. As far as I can tell, part of the problem overall is that GW2 was designed from the beginning with Living World in mind. The GW1 and GW2 player-base has always been an enigma of contradictions. They compare and hold GW1 dev up on a pedestal compared to GW2, but GW1 missed deadlines all the time. It's one of the reasons GW2 was created. GW2, by contrast, started out with a clear vision, but it changed when players and media clamored for expansion and someone made a decision to move away from LW, which is what GW2 was designed for, to Expansion style dev which threw the entire dev process out of whack. On top of it, HoT introduced raids, which made everyone angry for a while (just like LW S1 did). Then players got upset that Raid dev slowed and that reminisced on how "great" LW1 was. Now they go back to something akin to LW1/2 + LW3/4 and everyone finds something else to complain about. There is no making this fanbase happy. This is funny because based on the comments of recently about GW2's build system, it sounds like it had always been designed to be a faster-moving, constant release style system. NOT the system we got with HoT -&gt; LW3 -&gt; PoF -&gt; LW4.
---
&gt;i have been following them and they haven't been fucking up as bad as anet lol.
---
They fucked up bad enough that you can actually see the timeline where people jumped ship to other MMOs and as a result FFXIV and GW2 saw a big uptick in their population and profits. It’s not a coincidence that this all happened within the same timespan.
---
&gt;blizzard is more competent than anet so they will find a way to straddle the line between shitty behaviour / mechanics while still managing to actually keep their players
---
Actually, what blizzard has is multiple IPs and vast resources. WoW is their flagship MMO but it’s by no means what’s keeping them afloat.
---
&gt;i will take your opinion with a mountain of salt, do not worry.
---
Why are you so mad though?
---
I'm glad we're going back to what we had but they still need to address templates as a whole. They need to be made account wide *at minimum*. Charging us 3 times *per character* is pure insanity.
---
My email said November 28th to November 2. lol
---
Returning one of the functionalities we lost with the build templates.
---
I have so many fucking boosters, too...
---
I feel like I cheated a little, using my heal firebrand and we just stacked the entire fight. Can block, heal and stability the whole thing. Still a fun boss though.
---
They killed dungeons for fractals, way before raids came about. And that has mostly to do with dungeons being spaghetti code and the fact people only ran the short ones for gold 90% of the time.
---
&gt; HoT was successful w/o a doubt
---
If you want to only count profit for arenanet, sure, but as far as game integrity is concerned it was a fucking catastrophe and a dreadful expansion honestly
---
And this is exactly why they won't tell you that it already is in maintenance mode ;)
---
Literally UNPLAYABLE.
---
It seems to me you're on the same page as we all are.
---
Square is maye rich company and you need to pay every month to play... better compared with teso. You need to pay around 25€ for every update and it's nothing more than living story.
---
JP said that they originally thought LS4 was going to be the end of GW2 until LS5 was announced.
---
If you look at all the abandoned content ANET has left behind, it's very obvious there won't be some magic update that fixes everything.
---
At the same time, I have to wonder why ANET is releasing strike missions to "train people for raids" if the death is on the horizon? Their explicit goal implies future things for raiding.
---
&gt;Was that revenue for the organiser (ESL iirc?) or ArenaNet itself?
---
ArenaNet itself. ESL was getting paid by ANet on top of the prize money, so of course they made money lmao
---
&gt;They're trying to please everyone, and in doing so fail largely in every case.
---
I'm not really going to bother arguing the minutiae of every little aspect here, but it's definitely a fact that they dropped the ball in regards to satisfying everyone. Whether you disagree or not with each individual point isn't all that important. There are various ways to go about it, but it's pretty clear that ANet never really figured it out.
---
I'm a casual player myself, and I've never complained about HoT since it came out. Actually I found it very challenging and fun, and have the motivation to complete the content and relative achievements. It was hard at first, but it was acceptable because I knew I could always get help, and it was not that hard compared to some hardcore console games lol. And I still think HoT is the climax of GW2 for me, and I think it is the archetypal best open world content for mmorpg for players that are not quite used to hardcore raids but still want some sense of accomplishment to do some open PVE content solo-wise. So I just find it a bit difficult to understand what the above mentioned  "casual players" were thinking about when they were complaining back then, I've not witnessed the contentions at that time, but in my opinion their whining is not worth considering, nor should their complaints influence the direction of the game in any significant way. What they were expecting for is not for a mmorpg, but for some braindead mobile games xD. And it's quite a pity that GW2 have come to where it is today.
---
I haven’t played the game in several years and just came on this forum to see everyone is pissed off at the game an ANET - what’s happening ???
---
... .... ... ... ... ... ... ... .... ... .... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .... ... .... ... ... ...
---
It seems to me you have misplaced these triple/quadruple dots, so I decided to help you out and collected them here for future use! From now on, every time you need one of these, be sure to check back on this post.
---
they later clarified that and said Jormag is perceived as whatever will make the listener feel most comfortable for max manipulation (which really makes me wonder what the hell the Svanir hear).
---
also the voice actress is [Debra Wilson from Mad TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jkpbv3cWrQM) and I have been screaming on here about that since she was announced because she's *good*, honestly on Cree Summer or Kimberly Brooks' level.
---
&gt;except for Braham
---
Braham's journey has been the most interesting aspect of the game to me. 
---
The guy has obviously been working with undiagnosed depression and abandonment issues since his first introduction. Now he has lost his only connection to his mom, his BFF has left to join the Omalkahns, Rytlock has been taking some of his own issues out on him, and he has been feeling like a total shitbag for a couple of years now for abandoning his guild. The guy done fucked up, he knows it since he now has a nickname with "Vowbreaker", and since Tyria doesn't seem to have much in the way of psychiatric help for him to deal with it he is clinging to The Commander like a life raft. 
---
Honestly I'm fully expecting a downer ending with him accepting Jormag's branding because he wants that internal pain taken away.
---
Really we should be grateful norn wear clothes at all.
---
It's PURE fear mongering. Do you think Grothmar had no effort put into it? Because I think anyone with even a modicum of programming knowledge would disagree. And that was like a couple of months ago.
---
What you're really saying is they're not putting effort into the areas of the game you want them to put effort into. And that's fair enough. But it has nothing at all to do with the success of the game. It depends completely on how many people play that content as a percentage of the playerbase.
---
Ughhhh I was hoping the copper salvage o matic would go on sale
---
Dear devs, we need this in game.
---
Does it has boons ?
---
The entire separation between mammals and other warm blooded creatures and reptiles and other cold blooded creatures is that mammals maintain their temperature by generating their own body heat.... Norn being able generate more body heat isn’t and different from many other real mammals that do the same.
---
WvW folks are a lot friendlier these days. But what will *really* make us *super duper* friendly is getting into discord with your squad.   
---
If you're worried about it being a sausagefest, a lot of women play this game mode, many are commanders and lieutenants, and it's generally considered bad etiquette to creep.
---
God, I hope not. The Mists and the associated Divine Beings was the original Guild Wars: Utopia plot that GW2 replaced.
---
I'm half expecting Menzies, now that Balthazar is dead, Dhuum is down for the count, and the other gods are gone. He literally does not get talked about, and he's not dead.
---
I'd buy an expansion  , i'm not into Black Sheep gambling boxes .
---
Thanks \^.\^
---
Before installing pxy, I got approx 40fps on the Largos Twins fight at max settings, now I'm consistently at 60+

---
And of course they can always pull whatever out of their asses. Remember that’s ultimately how all the threats start, someone just makes it up
---
It is obvious that they make more money from living world than they do with expansions. If paid content was profitable enough to do instead of the free living world episodes they would be pushing more towards expansions but they are doing the exact opposite. Ditching free content entirely and only having paid content (aka expansions) would kill the game. People would leave, expansions wouldn't sell at all and the game would stop receiving any funding at all.
---
Living world content isn't amazing but it is enough to keep people entertained and it is short enough where i don't feel forced to dedicate all my free time to just this game, it has some down time that can be used playing other games and to keep up with various tv shows and movies.
---
Man I feel so fucking bad now. I hope anet allows us to be there for him :(
---
it is time to bring him back. what a legend
---
If you ever need someone to group with who isn't a toxic little shit, hit me up
---
I feel you but it’s also a matter of opinion. Many people like the less flashy and subtle weapons - I think the set is alright. There have been better LW crafting ones like dragonsblood but still
---
we should bring him back man. just seeing him deliver the expansion annoucement already brings joy to me
---
I like the more serious nature of the weapon set. I swapped over the Axes and Mace and Shield for my Warrior. Solid look. Especially the Tower Shield!
---
I already have over 500 transmutes, so 5 more is completely worthless to me.
---
&gt;ArenaNet itself. ESL was getting paid by ANet on top of the prize money, so of course they made money lmao
---
The latter part of the statement doesn't add up. I'm really not sure what you're trying to say here.
---
&gt;I'm not really going to bother arguing the minutiae of every little aspect here, but it's definitely a fact that they dropped the ball in regards to satisfying everyone.
---
They dropped the ball, but did so by trying to satisfy everyone instead of focusing their resources from the start. A legacy of poor choices and design debt from launch and earlier.
---
&gt;Whether you disagree or not with each individual point isn't all that important.
---
It absolutely is important. Proposing solutions is the easy part, but those proposals may miss the mark in terms of what actually needs to be addressed, and any consequences in terms of design elsewhere in the game.
---
&gt;There are various ways to go about it
---
Certainly, but do they actually address the real issue, rather than what the *player perception* of the issue is? Does it do so without causing yet more issues elsewhere?
---
&gt;but it's pretty clear that ANet never really figured it out.
---
I don't think they've ever really had the time to. The launch was rushed by NCSoft, while ArenaNet had been drinking way too much of their own kool-aid. LS1 was and continues to be a complete disaster for the game, LS2 was them figuring out how to do instanced story properly at a baseline, and it took HoT for them to actually get some semblance of depth to the game and nail down the core mechanics. 
---
By the time PoF comes out and it seems they've got the absolute basics and their content pipeline sorted out, Mike O'Brien decides to abscond with half of the studio. And now everyone else is paying the price. Lovely.
---
Tencent owning ggg means nothing, they only bought them in 2018. PoE was originally crowdfunded and they worked their asses off with little resources to make that game as good as it is. They also interact with thier community in balance discussions and just in general, its pretty clear the passion they have for the game and they share that passion with the community. You just don't get the same feeling from anet and the state and decline of the game rests entirely with them and thier poor communication and seeming lack of wanting to improve the game outside of living story and the gemstore.
---
Reality check. As a person who worked for publishing companies, I can't tell you how often this sort of thing gets by multiple editors. The human brain fills in what it expects to find and the sort of casual scrutiny newsletters would get would mean some mistakes were likely to get through.  This in particular is an easy thing to miss.  Hell I read that email and didn't notice it. Even though it said November, I saw December.
---
yea, i really felt left out, due to this.
---
&gt;I'm really not sure what you're trying to say here.
---
ArenaNet's metrics determined that Pro League more than paid for itself. This wouldn't make sense to say it was for ESL because ESL was getting paid to run Pro League. It more than paid for itself for them just by happening, metrics or not.
---
As to the rest of it, my point when I said "whether you disagree or not with each individual point isn't all that important" is that there's no real way for us to solve the problem ourselves on the forums. All we really know is that what ArenaNet chose to do didn't work, and even that's somewhat of an opinion. We can look at what happened and try to draw conclusions, but there's always going to be room for argument. There's no way for us to come to a conclusion about what should have happened that everybody agrees on.
---
&gt;I don't think they've ever really had the time to.
---
The game's been out for seven years. The problem of ANet "drinking way too much of their own kool-aid" still persists. They have not changed. In fact, it's gotten worse over time because they're able to work less and less with their engine. Not only do they not know what they should do, they can't do a lot of it even if they had the urge. Build templates are only the latest display of that. MO isn't the problem here. On top of that, you claim they've got their content pipeline sorted out? I have yet to see any proof of that.
---
Tbh I wouldn't be surprised if they're still trying to restructure to a functional state after such huge losses. A lot of experienced staff left/were laid off, there is likely huge knowledge gaps right now.
---
I never said you play WoW
---
I liked the Axe/Maces and bought the set to fulfill the achievement.
---
I hope we can find the mystery of the missing expansion.
---
Remember, shitposting is ok as long as it's an updoot circlejerk! :D
---
i never said i liked blizzard
---
And then it swings back to impressive when you realize that they never "removed" any features because the product that "provided" those features was an external hack.
---
It was a good question though. It should have a toggle.
---
in your defense, Firebrand may well be the most broken class in the game with how much it can do on its own.
---
If it's the same one I'm thinking about, probably it wouldn't be a good choice. Too prominent in the current organization to go along with us deeper into the Shiverpeaks, especially since the Trahearne fiasco.
---
Don't know? We have confirmed an amount of dragons and their spheres of influence. Fire lizard is asleep exactly like Jormag, she even said that she is sleeping under ice. And of course there is an unnamed water dragon.
---
We had Chronomancer in the past doing that, right now Firebrand. I wonder who will be next...
---
Sounds similar to the debuff from grothmar if you die at the effigy. Permanent immolation until you relog.
---
Bullshit. I'm honestly tired to repeat me again and again but here we go: GW2 was intended to have PvP as endgame. Just look at the combat system and it's obvious. But the whole PvP system was rushed and underdeveloped at release and as we know it didn't work out. Also they developed what they thought would be [super hard, very coordinated group style content](https://www.tentonhammer.com/articles/gw2-interview-with-colin-johanson-on-dungeons-and-underwater-content). We had to wait for HoT though until we actually got that with raids. The playerbase shifted towards a more casual audience because Anet gave their competitive and instanced PvE modes not enough attention and the non-casuals left the game. And now the narrative is that GW2 was ALWAYS a casual focused game, which just isn't true.
---
FYI I can play more than one game at a time, so I'm already playing other games that suit my taste. Still, I like Fractal CMs and Raids, have fun playing that content and want more of it. And I promise I will stop complaining about the neglect of these game modes when Anet removes them from their own informations about the game on their own website. Until then I'm led to believe that they are still an advertised and actively supported part of the game.
---
It's the Deluxe upgrade, not base Heart of Thorns.
---
It's a prerendered cutscenes. Even if they did work to try it (which given my arguably limited knowledge in video editing I'm not sure is possible), your character would look really out of place.
---
Do AMD Navi GPUs (Vega / 5700 / 5700 XT) still cause massive issues in GW2?
---
Was there any improvement with the latest drivers?
---
&gt; till the servers shut down some day.

Yeah, I’m a human who always runs hot. (I have dysautonomia due to a medical condition.) I really only need jackets/warm clothes if I’m sitting still, otherwise I overheat really fast. I will literally go for a hike in the snow wearing jeans and a short sleeved t-shirt. Norn running warm makes total sense to me.
---
except if you just obosted your char to lv80 and dont have the gera for it xd
---
It's still easy, but I liked the mechanics.
---
It's unfortunate that so many little details in the fight will go unnoticed, like how the icequake attack has this synergy with the ice storm that traps you, where if you are trapped or inside its AOE, they will combine into a shatter that deals extra damage. As it if were a combo field used by Fraenir. That was pretty cool.
---
I can only repeat this every time, this was different a long time ago and got changed because of the community.
---
When leagues started the matchmaking algorithm was actually trying to get the best teams when you queue. It looked for players that were closer to your own ranking and waited for those players to arrive. However, that lead to the situation that players who were in the higher divisions had to wait multiple 10 minutes or even up to an hour for the match to start.
---
There were a lot of complaints about this mainly "why do I have to wait an hour for a match that is over in 5-10 minutes or less because my teammates fell asleep?". Therefore ArenaNet changed it to create faster queues but that also meant to expand the selection process faster and take players that had a higher difference between their rankings.
---
none of those approaches are better than the other and bring their own problems with each other but it is much better to have faster queues than having to waste time sitting in the lobby doing nothing. And as you said, this would not be much of a problem if there were enough players to choose from.
---
???
---
I even finished the karka event... God gw2 showed such promise and potential near launch.
---
I really wish the game had been pushed back a year so they could polish it further, launch was rocky bug wise. But the original approach with Halloween, lost shores and wintersday were interesting.
---
Dungeons didn't a final nail, Anet was extremely clear they were never coming back long before raids came back and the stories of how difficult they were for Anet to work with are well established at this point.
---
Your point simply isn't coherent, having 5 people on the raid team isn't ruining this game for casuals. I don't agree this game was intended for casuals at launch either, it was designed to respect your time but that has nothing to do with making easy content. The increased focus on casuals over time is large part of why this game never took off, and why it's so niche
---
Yeah, there's still a shitload of other potential threats out there. Tyria is a fucking huge world and we've only explored maybe, what, 10% of it?
---
Off the top of my head there's:
---
-Primordus
---
-Kralk's "mother"
---
-Menzies
---
-The other gods and whatever shenanigans they're up to
---
-Cantha and everything related to it
---
-The Deep Sea Dragon
---
-The Foefire ghosts in Ascalon
---
-Malyck and his tree
---
-Whatever other eldritch horrors are chilling in the mists (they could easily revisit GW: Utopia type content)
---
-The Inquest
---
-All the previous races (Jotun, Seers, etc) that could make a comeback
---
-The other 90% of the world that extends beyond the in-game map.
---
There is far from any kind of shortage of potential threats or places to go. GW2 is known for having countless plot threads that exist but were never really developed.
---
The great benefit is how little time is consumed this way. I had no problem spending the gold, so I got from 300 to 500 in just under an hour, approximatly.
---
Get ready for the core engineer meta!
---
Literally a build template update on the 3rd of December...
---
That will be the end of gw.
---
Uh no? Separate PvE/PvP/WvW did not require anything external.
---
&gt;How/when upcoming stuff is revealed is obv important to its success; it would be irresponsible of any dev to just reveal it themselves.
---
If it's important "how" something is revealed, why did they make a live event to reveal Funko Pops? 
---
Seriously, all of his posts indicate that something is coming but that's not the problem; we all know that "something" is coming but we have no idea what that something is. What we've had so far has been a new low for the company, with build templates making the game unplayable for days, introducing bugs that still aren't fixed and adding monetisation to an essentially broken feature; the long-awaited episode 1 of the new saga is so half-assed that the character select screen is still the same from PoF as well as the "episode unlocked" notification.
---
It's clear that Tom is passionate about his job and that's honestly great but it's also sad that between the developers and players who both live the game there is a thick layer of incompetence that prevents the latter from enjoying the work of the former. Really, ArenaNet is failing its employees just as much as it's failing its customers.
---
New launcher confirmed!
---
Damn i miss those days..
---
I just want a single overarching storyline that isn't resolved with Asuran tech or Aurene being overpowered and killing the big boss. If the narrative team is able to deliver that, I'll be satisfied.
---
More flashy glowy stuff? No, thanks. Or put them in gemstore, I don't care.
---
They've done cutscenes with the commander before... I guess it is easier to pre-render but it still feels bad
---
Well, nostalgia is a key selling point of this game. 250 years have passed since GW, so I like to see how the areas and lore have developed. They hardly need to be the same, who would believe or expect that long a time. It is always a big part of world building. But judging by your remark you're apparently not interested in thinking about that.
---
Sounds like pvp equipment will just be additional slots on each template which is cool.. it means any equip tab can double as a pvp equipment tab.
---
Also, returning the auto equip is pretty cool.
---
&gt;I hope you can hold onto a tiny ray of hope.
---
Oh he knows what's up. I think they all do at the office about the state of the game/community and just aren't saying anything about it.
---
Good for them, glad there's some self-awareness being shown and I'm looking forward to see what they have in store for us.
---
Doesn't mention anything about revenant sadly...
---
Probably greatsword soulbeast, iirc it can hit about 30-50k
---
&gt; I'm looking forward to see what they have in store for us.
---
Man... It took me a bit to understand that you didn't mean "in the gem store for us"... Atleast I hope you didn't?
---
PoF is gonna be a content rich expansion guys. Trust us!
---
&gt; It’s like how as soon as you get mounts in PoF, you’re immediately confronted with gaps you have to jump across and packs of spiders you have to use raptor round up on.
---
Except mounts are usable everywhere, not just in places where there's a gap. The gaps are a tutoturial so you can use your mount everywhere. Pressing F on a statue is the full extent of what the key does.
---
I feel like I know not to put my dick on the table without ever getting it stomped on.
---
&gt;  The point of the Raven locks is not that you cannot open them, it's that they are not open by default, and players must engage with them to open them.
---
Pressing F on an unblocked, unguarded, statue next to a door to open it: Expansion Worthy Feature
---
if were going by the picture, honestly people only complaining about her outfit are being the weird ones, svanir isn't even wearing any top at all, atleast joras nipples are kinda warm.
---
&gt;we as a community need to get more players in, convince our friends to play
---
"Please play this awesome single player furry dress-up simulator with me! Once every three months we *even* get some story!"
---
Yeah but that mastery actually has a use literally everywhere and is usable wherever you want instead of just incredibly specific incredibly limited pre-determined spots on the map anet arbitrarily decided to put it.
---
The thing is, he’s not being specific.  Since he’s the narrative director does that just mean really cool things are coming story related?  My point is to take it with a grain of salt.  If something really big is coming, I feel like someone other than the narrative director would say something and it wouldn’t be on a personal Twitter account.
---
You know when there were big layoffs and people were saying, "it'll take some time before the full impact of this becomes apparent"?
---
That's where we are now.
---
Feel free to play other games. Come back when there's something that excites you.
---
I could test that with my necro sounds like a big crit
---
I just completed POF whole map with necro gs . No idea about the name of a single skill nor what they do. I just click everything in aequence spam F1 and again.
---
I just wanted to use a bit to try. It is just a classe u can play facerolling on the Keyboard
---
 
---
Mastering is hard but it is playable by a kid
---
30-50k? that is impressive and absolutely a one hit
---
You Are kind of player that makes events last longer xd upscaling mobs hp and dont bring the dps
---
You don't need much time to count in Gw2 as a hardcore play, maybe like 5-max. 10 hours a week. It just depends what you're doing in this time and your attitude towards the game since 99.9% are toxic super casuals, who almost only dedicate themselfs to stay THAT casual, at least it seems like it.
---
She's been absent for both episodes
---
Artificially bringing up difficulty of Open world when Anet is unable to do anything.
---
No need to thank me, this is my true passion.
---
I'm more surprised that the letter was addressed to the character I played the absolute least amount of time.
---
Considering the amount of people on this subreddit that claim they have quit the game I would assume people would get the information even if they were not actively playing.
---
Im sure we all had this day where nothing worked.
---
&gt;given the (apparently?) slower release &amp; content pace
---
Hm? What you on about? The current release pace is (so far) actually faster than it has been for quite a while.
---
That's why longbow ranger is even more hated as necros. guardians and warriors are at least usefull for group support.
---
I can only think of, maybe, three uses for them. 
---
1) Breaking the game.  
---
2) You died in an area you're not supposed to be in and it's a pain to get there.  
---
3) You're shit at the game and the story checkpoint is in a shitty spot.
---
My bad, rephrased that part. It's the fact that we don't have very "impactful" content, even if it's a bit faster than previously :)
---
I think that even with how braindead easy much of the game is, it's still not braindead enough to be playable on mobile - or to allow mobile players coexist with PC players, that is.
---
&gt;If it's important "how" something is revealed, why did they make a live event to reveal Funko Pops?
---
There are lots of legitimate complaints to be had about how ANet have been handling things, and the releases in general, and even the presentation.  However, the merchandising in the presentation takes LITERALLY less than three minutes of the entire thing.  There are less than 4 minutes of merchandising, from 31:25 to 35:15, after which it goes to another preview trailer for the saga.  There never have been 15 minutes of advertising for funkos, and claiming there was just makes you look like an idiot.  Complain about all the real problems, but let go of this idiocy (Especially because a vocal portion of the population has been complaining that ANet doesn't do any marketing).
---
I can agree with this. And true, i only solo on my necro, since it brings nothing except reviving allies to a group instance, which others can do equally good or better. For group instances i go on my guardian.
---
Haha sorry about my wording man.
---
Not sure if it's an unpopular opinion here, but I will say that I hope the Gem Store is not the future. I'm one of those guys that would prefer more earnable and achievable rewards through actual game play.
---
Going to watch this song. Since i have been playing necro since launch, i am sure i will have a laugh. Thanks for the in depth information
---
Warrior's hammer #2 can do some big crits too.
---
Sorry, but money talks louder than words. If these players buy significant % gems, then they can pretty much expect that the game continues to provide for them.
---
Oh the nightmares of Ursa(n) Way.
---
Hello,
---
Do you remember what are the traits you used to reach this point? For the armor/weapons, I assume that they are all berzekers.
---
Implying that kind of person even knows what a special action key is.
---
I don't see any "glimpse about the future of the game" but the communication on corporate PR language level and patting each other shoulders. Only GrubySzymek had balls to ask directly for a road map and got standard canned reply.
---
I actually believe this about the narrative director, but in my eyes that's the problem. The people who care the most about this game are the ones writing the story. Everyone likes a good story when playing a video game, but it is still a video game. Game play is paramount. I'm sure there are plenty of people who put story first, but it isn't enough for most people.
---
The days when the player base had hopes for the games future
---
&gt;the thing that looked really interesting was the targeted support for 4k @ 60 fps
---
Yeah, those are the buzzwords these days but they are only just buzzwords. Whether a game can run at 60 fps doesn't depend on the publisher's newest toy and I don't see GW2 meeting the requirements for that frame rate unless a total rework of the game engine is carried out.
---
Also, GW2 has always been "under NCSoft". ANet was already a subsidiary back with GW1.
---
https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/thief/deadeye/rifle/
---
Its a raid build, but works well enough for the overworld/fractals
---
Tiny ray of hope..,. Very encouraging words !
---
We used to make elite spec speculation posts and fanmade expansion pack maps.
---
Now, art posts and comics are the most hyped posts on the sub.
---
Its a raid build, but works well enough for PvE and fractals
---
&gt; but the hardcore are fighting tooth and nail to deny and disprove without evidence.
---
"...but downvoting those guys to -6 points on some drama post in some Internet community will definitely make that major game developer listen to *meee* and not all of their data!"
---
Might wanna credit u/thatshaman here..
---
&gt; Not sure if it's an unpopular opinion here, but I will say that I hope the Gem Store is not the future. I'm one of those guys that would prefer more earnable and achievable rewards through actual game play.
---
Literally 99% of the people here share that opinion. We all want to get actual content and rewards and have the gem store as a nice addition and not have the gem store as 90% of the content in the game. But we will see what ANet will do in the future.
---
I am pretty sure that they heard us and now it on them to act on it.
---
&gt;!If you watch the last cut scene of the latest episode Jormags says that he still sleeps too!&lt;
---
It is also worth pointing out that when JP was at the company they had moved plenty of resources into other project. The majority of those (if not all) projects have been killed off, so the information she had is probably no longer especially relevant.
---
&gt;the merchandising in the presentation takes LITERALLY less than four minutes of the entire thing
---
And the rest of the presentation only repeated things that everyone knew already. 
---
The actual reveals were the trailer and the existence of strike missions. The whole subreddit went into a spree of posting "that's it?" and it wasn't until an interview with a German magazine that we learned that other forms of content were "on the table". 
---
So yeah, a live event for announcing Funko Pops and a Google translated interview for explaining stuff about the actual game. The only idiocy I see here is the "amazing Marketing folks" not being laughed out of Washington state.
---
Unlike normal PC/console games all that mobile trash isn't that hard or expensive to make. Most of those mobile games need just a few whales at start to be very profitable. And nobody cares if they shut it down year later.
---
I don't see any "glimpse about the future of the game" but the communication on corporate PR language level and patting each other shoulders with little to no details at all. Only GrubySzymek had balls to ask directly for a road map and got standard canned reply.
---
His avatar face doesn't make whole thing better at all.
---
It actually was. They just let it die because they didn't maintain the content that worked well when everyone played it and switched it to content that's soloable / or just fixing those damn rewards. 
---
Besides that PoF and LS4 were the best thing GW2 has ever experienced.
---
god.. this Sounds even more complicated than before... i wish they would realize that their loadouts are a failure and remove them 🙄 theres nothing wrong with admitting that they have shipped shit and didnt know how to improve that
---
I constantly hear about games that I don't play. It's not hard to keep up to date. Can even watch the few Twitch streams that still exist.
---
And some people like you obviously havent yet seen whole guilds just give up on game and leave. For every person that announced they left, there is hundreds or thousand people that left without saying a word. They just stopped caring trying to voice their opinion because nobody ever listened.
---
You might think you said something edgy and smart there, but reality is the game is on autopilot and not getting better. Trend of people leaving and not coming back is almost impossible to stop and in 1 year the game will be empty.
---
So yes, OP is vital to the game, just like every other person that left the game in past XX months.
---
What kind of monster puts the task bar at the top of the screen?
---
https://i.imgur.com/CNx1mQH.jpg
---
Longbow ranger is hated cause for some reason their players like to knock away enemies...
---
Wow nice gifts /s
---
It's easy to make players feel like the game has a future... Communicate about what you are working on.
---
 I don't care when we will have a new raid or fractal or open world or elite spec. The when is not the most important. I just want to know that arena net is working on something interesting.
---
Right now, there is no info about anything besides  "there is episodes coming in the saga". This is not a clear view of the future of the game.
---
I love this game and i really hope there will be more, but without this clear view, it's not reassuring and when people are afraid for the future of a game, they might buy less stuff.
---
Sorry if i made some mistakes in english, it's not my first language
---
As if he was going to say otherwise :D
---
The bar in the picture is actually the Gmail taskbar.
---
But I still have my  windows task bar at the top it's clearly the superior way xD
---
Is it too late to get code? Would appreciate it. ❤️
---
With my setup I definitely can't, but if I switch to my cc heavy build I can sometimes break it.
---
Considering its a subreddit, it only reach a small group of dedicated players.
---
FoW ursan way was so stupid easy
---
&gt;And some people like you obviously havent yet seen whole guilds just give up on game and leave. 
---
I did, actually. It happened right after raids were released. The thing is, guilds come and go all the time. If a guild was specifically built up around a certain part of the game, then I would fully expect for that guild to dissolve if that portion of the game is no longer fully supported, but the thing is, max guild size is 500 players, which is a drop in the bucket for overall player size, so dozens of guilds could "nope" right out of the game, and not have *any* impact on the overall population. And of course people who were in those guilds but who weren't so 100% unitasking, they would just find new guilds to join, or just not be in a guild but continue to play the game. 
---
&gt;For every person that announced they left, there is hundreds or thousand people that left without saying a word. 
---
There's no evidence to support the idea that there has been a mass exodus of players. Revenues have been relatively stable over the past five years or more, which would indicate a *relatively* stable population, and I've heard no data indicating otherwise. The only "evidence" to support the idea of a mass exodus is "a bunch of people *I* know left. . ." which is not actual evidence, it's just anecdote, and if the person saying it is one of the people who played one of the fringe modes regularly, then it only stands to reason that their circle of friends in the game would mostly be people who *also* played that fringe mode.
---
&gt;Trend of people leaving and not coming back is almost impossible to stop and in 1 year the game will be empty.
---
If people said the same thing in 2014, when their revenues were roughly equal to today, then those people would have been wrong. Maybe you'll be right though, and the game will be dead in 1 year, but I doubt it.
---
&gt;Involuntary celibate? Pretty sure like 80% of this sub is involuntarily celibate.
---
FYI, incels aren't just "lonely virgins" they're misogynists who literally advocate for sexual slavery. Read some of the posts on incel subreddits if you don't believe me.
---
But your understanding of human sexuality sounds about on par for the average incel. I don't need to be "educated" by the same tired talking points incels spout constantly. 
---
What you're citing is "Bateman's Principle" which has lots of [criticism from other scientists and evidence that contradicts it.](http://theconversation.com/data-should-smash-the-biological-myth-of-promiscuous-males-and-sexually-coy-females-59665) It's not a bad *hypotheses*, per-se, but it's certainly not the absolute fact you're touting it as.
---
As I said previously, human sexuality is incredibly too complex to be simplified to an overly-simple misogynistic "lock and key" metaphor. 
---
Congratulations! Now you're educated and no longer have an excuse to pretend you know what you're talking about.
---
Could be decay as well.
---
Decay has no influence on match-making and can go up to 700.
---
I experienced matches with gold players in p2 but never silver.
---
Added them to my friend list to check real rating.
---
May I get a code for me and my wife please? Hopefully we’re not too late. Thanks in advance.
---
Been receiving them since 2012, can't remember how I subscribed to the newsletter.
---
1. Not a glimpse. "Cool things are coming" is what any business would say. It's uninformative, unless you thought there was any possibility of them saying "Nothing is coming, game's dead".
---
2. Don't forget the difference between things you think are cool, and things they think are cool. They proudly presented funko pops, and surely they think every lw episode is awesome. Did you?
---
Still doesn't change what I said, that even the newsletter has issues.
---
On both the places where dates are involved they made the same mistake.
---
Games from companies that communicates probably.  
---
The twitch channel that i never see because of the little number of viewers ? Followed channels menu doesn't show the little one.
---
The have put Really Cool Things™ on the table
---
&gt; Damn got triggered hard 
---
One. Joke.
---
We're back to prologue levels of trash. For the half of the fight - literally. 
---
Cuddle bears strike was kinda unique, had kinda nice mechanics, and could kinda teach people some stuff (like flux bomb or killing bosses simultaneously) even if it was too easy to the point of being worthless. 
---
But this is pathetic, another afk stack in the middle and hit 1111 fest. And it also made enterily of the reused stuff. gg, 2/10.
---
Now that I think about it, you're totally right. They did it in the final cutscene of Long Live the Lich. Kinda actually bums me out and makes me feel like LS5 is going to be a way bigger disappointment than I thought.
---
But we have that already! D:
---
I suppose the roadmap now is
---
* February 2020, new character select screen
---
* May 2020, new BL icon in the gem store to reflect the new icon
---
* July 2020, assorted tooltip fixes
---
* September 2020, announcement of Crecia, Jhavi and Ryland Funko Pops
---
* November 2020, update on Alliances
---
I mean it isn't THAT big of a skill-test even before the nerf. Veterans keep games and communities alive more than casuals ever will, so we should dumb it down to be THAT easy? IMO PoF isn't that less difficult, yet nobody complained about that. It was the shock from being a mega ez open world to a challenging one. But literally just dodging at the right time and not having a completely useless build got you through.   
---
At some point people DO need to be told "git gud", you can't dumb shit down forever.  
---
And even if you are having trouble this game is literally made to play with others in the OW anytime, anywhere as people DID in HoT. AI remember a lot of casuals crying they can't do events on their own anymore and have to call for help.... in an mmo.   
---
Like fam if you can play 1h a day or whatever and you prefer to play alone with a rando build, then you need to just deal with what that brings you and not dumb the game down because it's pretty assenine to say "raids for hardcore players only" or "open world for casuals only", they're not and there shouldn't be that disparity to begin with. Because what you don't understand is that content being too easy stops REMOTELY skilled players from enjoying the main body of content.   
---
You then decide which sides enjoyment is more important, the vets who actually sink money into your game, or the casuals who buy an xpac once every 3 years?  
---
The choice is pretty clear to me.
---
I just want to help with the cc T\^T
---
I doubt this would affect GW2 - L2 is still the flagship product of NCSoft and since the Bluehole Studio backslash (stolen code that was meant to be L3 and become TERA) they're trying badly to make this really aged game be attractive enough to keep the playerbase/customers flying away to the other titles. It also seems that already existing mobile client isn't successful that much and players want same gaming experience and not some prosthetic of it, thus this emulator got greenlight. This is rather L2 exclusive project - at least at the moment. 
---
It looks like they want to remaster L2 in UE4 as site reports [in other post](https://mmoculture.com/2019/11/lineage-ii-remastered-work-begins-on-unreal-engine-4-renewal-project/) - which would be really interesting since game is way more clunky with its aged engine than GW2
---
"We received your feedback and we don't agree.  Keep playing okay?"
---
I feel like a lot of people here are apologizing the artists choice of discreetly drawing borderline porn by saying norn generate body heat and are „so tall nothing can hit them up there“. This is just sad. Give the female characters some badass armor too.
---
Why make all content so easy? You dont get feeling like you done well when every thing is so goddmn easy
---
I don‘t know if you‘ve realized, but female norm tend to have a big bust. That shit‘s heavy, and going without support isn‘t just painful in itself, you back wouldn’t‘t play along for long. These nipple pasties are just as bad as going bare, imo.
---
But we're asking for a road map for... How long? Years?
---
I rather have Jessica Price tell me aboot what is wrong with my gender and why she is the best person ever.
---
That's nice that they are adding back an existing feature they removed. Now how about revenant utilities fix?
---
I missed when Aurene one shot Kralkatorrik.
---
This. I love this.
---
Guardian to obtain the same requires knowledge of the class mechanic.
---
Lb is just hated for moving away target 
---
Necros...
---
Uh look 7 veterans. Let's aggro them all and randomly kill them smashing keys.
---
As of right now, they have a studio with less than 150 people working since the layoffs, that's employees and not development staff. According to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/6f76zy/the_ffxiv_dev_team_changes_over_time/) as of March 26, 2019 FF14 has almost 300 ingame development staff and then some outsourced devs, they're nowhere near "equivalent". 
---
Financially the game has been steadily going down in revenue, which is different from profit, just because you see 16 bln Won doesn't mean they're making a huge profit out of it. Logically less revenue means less profit but we don't know the actual margin of it and then comes something called budget, it doesn't matter if the studio earns 10million dollars, there's gonna be a specific budget on everything that's being developed, and that budget is clearly going down, if you really believe this latest episode was this short and the map split into two because of feedback or new approach you're only fooling yourself.
---
Also what OP seems to forget is that they already charge for the seasons. Seasons are only free during the time its released and up to the next one being released, after that you have to buy the episodes/seasons, so changing it to charge everybody for them would not only cause devastating consequences for the game but also not increase revenue in any meaningful way.
---
They'd have to be completely stupid to not know already that a roadmap is needed. This makes me believe that the absence of a roadmap is by design.
---
You’re definitely not alone on that, I 100% agree.  The whining and complaining at the beginning of HoT was super annoying.  Too many gamers these days just barely sample the content before they start whining about it.
---
&gt; You’re very kind, and I will always endeavor to be worthy of that trust. Luckily there are a lot of people like me at ArenaNet. :-)
---
Then *talk to us*! Tell us what the plans are! They can't just expect us to keep investing in this game financially and emotionally based on the vague promise that a "tiny ray of hope" is coming some time in the future. To be blunt "Really cool things." could to a narrative director could be an "exciting" plot twist that we totally didn't all see coming a mile away.
---
Was it the oldest?
---
I agree
---
At least you try and play the game mode! 
---
I've heard a lot of player not even giving PvP a try because the are scared of losing.
---
You should be proud of yourself even with all the defeats :P
---
Looking around me, which is primarily guilds and friends that do PvE and Raids, I don't notice a whole lot different compared to 2 years ago.
---
Guilds being more empty is something I see, but that's not really a recent thing; That decline happened when they stopped bringing out more guild specific content like Guild Missions or anything Guild Hall related. People don't really need to join guilds to do the other things they want to do in the game, and that shows. I do see some people who havent played in ages pop up and check on how the game is doing, which is to be expected from a B2P game like this.
---
Raid LFGs look the same to me as they ever did, and I don't play WvW or PvP so I really can't say anything about that.
---
Trying to map the general population based on gw2efficiency has always been flawed and should be taken with a serious grain of salt, because its only a specific selection of people that have accounts there and I don't believe it accurately represents the actual population and their activity at all.
---
That being said: 
---
- I don't expect most people in general to go for the Mastery achievement, especially only a week after release, due to the variety of specific things you need to complete.
---
- Personally I care very little about things in BLC chests, and not much attention has been brought to the existance of this specific dye set. I have the cheapest dye unlocked myself but that's only because I did get a Black Lion Key from map completion. If I got the usual wardrobe junk I wouldn't have known this thing existed in the first place.
---
- For both the Strike Mission and the Boneskinner, while they were both featured in the trailer, the game doesn't really put any focus on either existing if you simply run through the story or do the meta. I certainly didn't know about the Boneskinner champ being an event until after I finished the story and ran into it by accident, and the Strike Mission location I only found after actively searching it out.
---
That all doesn't really look like signs to me that the game isn't alive, those look like signs that Anet should be working on making these specific new features or events more noticeable ingame.
---
In addition ANet started working on a mobile game sometime around or after HoT, posting job ads for it and diverting resources to it, slowing the content production rate on GW2.  Then that whole effort seems to imploded earlier this year with the layoffs of half the studio.
---
Most people have internet nowadays
---
His tweets are as useless as new masteries.
---
No, and neither the youngest.
---
Whispers in the Dank
---
Don't give them any ideas :D they will add stuff like this to the Gem Store like it's nothing, then we will uave even more crazy looking effects on characters
---
Discretize for fractals builds, Snowcrows for raid builds.
---
The reason - dT builds are calculated including 150AR + Pots + etc, where as SC builds are not.
---
Banner warrior is a decent fit, however in fractals/raids, it does tend to be a mechanics role.  Boon chrono is not preferred in high end fractal groups (CMs) and often used as the tank in chrono+firebrigade comps which are becoming more popular in EU raid LFG.
---
 I would recommend power dragonhunter or condi firebrand (which can easily be adapted to condi+quickness) if you want a single character for both raids and fractals.
---
The best tip: Use Chocolate Omnombetty Cream as food. +100 concentration and +40% MF when you have a boon.
---
They were designed for Exalted, but the Vinetooths are generally described as "elite hunter-killers" for everyone:
---
&gt; Betrayed and wounded by Faolain during the escape, Eir fell in combat with a Vinetooth, Mordremoth's elite hunter-killer.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Prisoners_of_the_Dragon#My_Story
---
&gt; Pact Commander: A vinetooth? Majestic? Those things are horrific killers.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Predator%27s_Path#Dialogue
---
Would have been better if they were all Elite ranked at the lowest, rather than Veteran. I always felt that their numerous veteran presence lowered how dangerous they felt after the first one killed Eir.
---
That's what a marketing team is for. Advertisement from mouth to mouth is something that's happening naturally when a game is blooming. I can't, in a good sense, "convince" a friend of mine to play a game when the future doesn't look good.
---
Looks like a nice back scratcher LuL
---
There’s not going to be a new IP unless it’s a mobile game.  
---
Launching something new and rebuilding a player base comparable to GW2’s on ANet’s current resources is next to impossible.  Far more optimal for them to milk GW2 as long as they can, especially if they can get back to a 2yr expansion cadence again.
---
&gt;FYI, incels aren't just "lonely virgins" they're misogynists who literally advocate for sexual slavery.
---
So, why are you not calling them misogynists if its a more apt description?
---
&gt;What you're citing is "Bateman's Principle" which has lots of criticism from other scientists and evidence that contradicts it. It's not a bad hypotheses, per-se, but it's certainly not the absolute fact you're touting it as.
---
Baby take 9 months and a massive ammount of risk, resources and protection to make while leaving the mother vunerable.
---
Cum take 10 minutes and minimal resources, risk or protection to make without leaving the father vunerable.
---
You can beat around the bush all you like, but at the end of day, these are just the facts of life.
---
&gt;Not to mention the entire thing kind of falls apart when you remember that LGBT people exist.
---
Not really though? If two women fuck its just two locks. Its just that none of them are ever going to be opened and both are genetic dead ends. I don't see how it falls appart.
---
it had a lot of stuff on the maps, but they aren't replayable. adventures not worth replaying, treasure hunting is sad, only the pinata meta is fine. bounties are worthless unless u grind for lege trinkets. it's all just badly designed in terms of replayability.
---
sorry, i can't hold onto a tiny ray of hope, i've been doing so for a long time and now it's gone :) gl hf
---
You can look at current flood of negative reviews of Google Stadia for a prominent example of how platform support of 4k/60fps doesn't really mean anything for individual game performance.
---
This is a fair point. It's one of the reasons I was against adding raids in the first place.
---
Ok but I bet the developers are some of those guys that prefer to be paid for the actual work.
---
Ooooooh boi hope we get some bank expansion discounts, could rly use some
---
&gt;Maybe this really cool thing is a line of dialogue.
---
A svanir fires an arrow at Marjory. 
---
Marjory: "ow my knee! Now I can no longer go on adventures with you DDD:"
---
No improvement.  GW2 optimization is still trash.
---
Yes, I bet you would prefer free movie tickets too.
---
No. HoT was NOT successful - in fact, looking at the earnings and player report from that time, the words that best decribed it were "Complete Disaster".
---
Far more players abandoned the game than joined. The quarterly earnings dropped to a quarter of what they were before the HoT announcement - Even the post-LS2 content drought was more profitable than any quarter after 2015.
---
PoF was an attempt to go back and re-capture what the game lost with HoT. But it seems they missed, and the people who stayed for HoT didn't like it, while those who left didn't come back.
---
Shiverpeaks
---
how? It's all hollow and vague.
---
It's better than nothing at all :)
---
Adding a 0 wouldn't make the fight more interesting, just longer.
---
Not sure how people can feel uplifted by this post. It's just one of the many hollow and vague posts. It shares nothing and gives us no insight.
---
"Things are coming" is meaningless. If they add more gemstore stuff, "things have come". If they look cool, according to ArenaNet, "really cool things happened".
---
They are "working hard on the future", with 1 hour content releases every few months.
---
How can this hollow uselessness give anyone hope?
---
Good.
---
&gt;Is making the debuff area specific really that hard?
---
Surprisingly - yes. Volume triggering effect with low delay is usually quite taxing on engine, so it's better and easier for everyone to apply trigger to said volume barrier.
---
Thank you for taking part in our alpha tests.
---
This right here. The fact that this was basically ignored tells me all I need to know. This is now a single player story game I log into once a month for that and avoid LA for the eyes bleeding gemstore whale show.
---
yeah but people in this reddit actually complained that those strike missions are too hard to kill :D
---
Again, how? He said nothing at all, there's 0 value to that post.
---
This patch is all about giving us a functionality back we had for 7 years.

While LFG in Lion's Arch Aerodrome, I had the occasion to see some "sellers" bitching about their "clients".

Man, you took the money so STFU.

I feel a lot of people like to make an issue out of it specifically missing the fact that her brothers outfit in the same image is very similar.

---
this. i would convience my friends to try a lot of games, but gw2 wouldnt be part of it.
---
Aah yeah i see. Should have been more specific.
---
&gt;"We received your feedback and we don't agree. Keep **paying** okay?"
---
Fix'd.
---
This but unironically
---
&gt; Yes, the saga isn't over yet.
---
So? Season 4 is over. The saga was supposed to replace the expansion as we were told over and over. So, where is the expansion worthy stuff we would get?
---
We're 2 episodes in and anet already said that the third episode will mostly share masteries with the second one. Where all these expansion worthy features they promised?
---
&gt;I wouldn't have bought PoF just because of the Casino coin hunt or the memory game you need to play for getting a Mastery point in Crystal Oasis, but I'm glad they included them. I wouldn't get that mastery point and start screaming "That isn't 'expansion worthy!!!!'"
---
The casino coin hunt doesn't require a mastery to play, so your example here is complete moot.
---
&gt;It's a lore thing.
---
Ok. So? Its still a shit mastery. Using lore to justify shitty mechanics doesn't change the fact that they are bad mechanics.
---
&gt; It allows you to progress through areas that "most people" can't, even if every player on the map is not "most people."
---
"Even if every player who joins the map can instantly open the doors of that map, that doesn't mean every player can open the doors."
---
I was gonna mock the cognitive dissonance but I was left in genuine awe of how insane this statement is.
---
&gt;There's no opportunity cost here, we aren't getting this ability "instead of" something better, and getting this ability is not "costing" us anything. It does not have to "compete" with any other abilities for "worthiness." It's just a tool that accomplishes a task, and handles it just fine.
---
We literally are getting this ability instead of something better. This is the mastery we get for this episode. We could have gotten a non shitty mastery for this episode instead of a shitty one.
---
&gt;It's just a tool that accomplishes a task, and handles it just fine.
---
Its a meaningless tool that accomplishes a nonexistent task.
---
So when is the next announcement of the announcement of the big announcement of the announcement?
---
They sorta said that we wont get any fractals or raids for quite a while [here](https://dd.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dyofr5/we_wont_get_any_fractals_raids_or_legendaries/) at least
---
May sound crazy, but one problen was caused by Anti-virus programs.
---
"I used to be an adventurer like you..."
---
You need a reason to continue? Cheaper 32 slots bag. Need 80 Eitrite Ingots.
---
Looks like roadmap is not on the table
---
Oh, didnt notice he has hitbox like that. But in general, there are only a few mechanics you have to more or less care about, other than that its all ignorable aoe
---
I wish more of the gem store items were earn-able in-game such as the new celestial axe skin.
---
Well... It needs a better story, too!
---
Remember when we got teasers for the trailer of the prologue?
---
We didn't even get that for LW5E1...
---
The TP prices for them are on the wiki. If you sold twilight and sunrise you would have more than enough to purchase eternity.
---
I've played PoE, it's entirely different from GW2, for one as people said it's an APRG, it's basically a solo game online with PvP, it's nothing close to an MMO.  ArenaNet has always been that way with communication, this isn't something new so I don't know why people are surprised, they've been that way since the beginning...they used to have an Alpha team that did a lot of testing and working on the inside with the new stuff, that was their link to the community.  The other point is this is their game, they have a vision for it(or at least an outline) and though the game should be made for the consumers, it's still ultimately the studio's and designers.
---
&gt; instead of just incredibly specific incredibly limited pre-determined spots on the map anet arbitrarily decided to put it.
---
You mean like bouncing mushrooms, updrafts, itzel poison lore, all exalted masteries, Rollerbeetle's barrier smash, Skysclaes rift repair and almost all LS3 masteries? 
---
Raven Bond is by far not the only one and definitely not the first mastery that is restricted to certain maps and/or certain spots on a map.
---
So why is this mastery so different from all the others?
---
Just forget about them. You can master everything in a matter of a few hours and never have to think about their mechanics again.
---
No, raids.
---
...PVP wasn’t added after HoT
---
but why? ff14 , wow , TESO all of them have a sort of road map or a well know "list" of what is coming in the future , and they are live and in good health
---
doubt
---
I think you've misunderstood what these 300 people are doing. The living world teams are split up into a cycle. So one team works on content that's due soon. Another works on the next release. And another in the release after that. When the first team.releases their content they go to the back of the queue and start developing the co tent that will bow be 3 releases away. (This is hard to type so o hope it's making sense).
---
Then there is the wvw team. The PvP team. Other teams repeated to patching and support. HR. Marketing. Management. Communications. Customer service. Infrastructure. Facilities. Legal... you don't have 300 people all banding together to work on the core content. I can guarantee that group of 25 were just a few devs with no HR or it support. Or many of the other functions you see in a more established business
---
You're talking about different casuals. You think casual can't mean dedicated. It's not true. There are a ton of people who are casual, in that they are focused on more things like immersion and flavor, rather than mechanics, and they play just as much as raiders do. In fact, there are raiders, not just here, but in many games, that get their raids done for the week and that's it.
---
I have a guild full of casuals. A lot of people in my guild work full time. They have money but not time. They spend money in the gem store for outfits, skins, they buy black lion keys. 
---
There's guys like me who play a ton of hours, spend money in the cash shop, but don't raid and tend not to to PvP much. I certainly don't really care much how much instanced content is added to the game.
---
We're not casual by hours played, we're casual because we aren't looking for the hardest content. We're looking to immerse ourselves in a fantasy world.
---
On top of that, most of us aren't game hoppers. We pick a game and stick with it because it's the only game we play. I'm not running off playing other games, because I'm here. Plenty of people in my guild have time for one game, and this is that game. They're not likely to start a new game, because they're happy here and don't want to learn a new game.
---
There are game hoppers too. They're always going to move around no matter what game they go to.  They're just not the demographic I'm talking about.
---
ahhh so there actually are people instaling taskbars. Everytime some softwere ask me to instal some taskbar I always feel bad for taskbar devs for choosing NO, FUCK OFF. Its good to know some people instal them :)
---
We don't know that they don't have money probelms. THe quarterly reports are revenue not profit. When the layoffs happened, NCsoft said with the size of the team the game was not financially sustainable. Now there are less staff, but we don't know what amount of revenue they need to be profitable.
---
Yeah but those whakes are casuals. Casual gaming is a more lucrative market.
---
&gt; they think their story is really engaging.
---
If they do they're fucking deluded. I've seen some bad writing in my day but man GW2 is just absolutely infuriating. They routinely brush past and almost touch on interesting ideas and developments, only to substitute it with cringe-inducing dialogue and an idiotic plot.
---
Don't be silly. 
---
That's clearly level 80 armor. Those are ORICHALCUM pasties!
---
i always do it clockwise for some reason and have no need to backtrack or waypoint in the route i use. I always take it easy and go with my skyscale. It could be done much faster (my clockwise route i mean) by combining griffon and beetle but i see no reason to do it in my case since i always do at least the 1st instance on all my alts (that means i start with 2 POI done).
---
* Guild Wars 2 is intended to be a game. 
---
* Guild Wars 2 *is not* intended to be a lifestyle.
---
If the new fractal/raid/pvp-map/dance-party isn't ready yet, go play a different game until your thing becomes available, then play it.
---
Reaper at game release ? Hot release you mean
---
Just look back within the years gw2 has been running and what projects ncsoft had during those time and its easy to tell.
---
Again like I said an hour and a half to complete the story and then it takes maybe a week and a half to complete the achievements and that’s being generous and casual. Then what do you do for the next three months till the next release? If it is true that you have 20,000 hours then I don’t think you represent the average casual player at all. You are an outlier, you are probably about 0.1% of casuals, I’m not pretending you don’t exist but I wouldn’t say you represent the average casual player even remotely . The average casual player does the living world and doesn’t come on for 3 months till the next one. Maybe does some a few achievements and doesn’t really touch raids or fractals because they aren’t encouraged to and don’t need to, therefor that content doesn’t get played and then anet Abandon it. And I have 5000 hours
---
I think they are just announcements *(wow new xpack and ffxiv new game+)* but either way key point is they are in good health
---
GW2 isn't
---
A roadmap has to get people excited on itself *(and offer transparency)* that's why they are released to the public. Roadmaps also need some kind of way of people knowing whats the state of completion or when it will be released. If Anet were to make one right now for 2020, it would probably have 3 items all of them being LS episodes. Otherwise they wouldn't be so silent about what to expect.
---
The thing at home is intended to be worse
---
That's the thing, it doesn't. People are just dumb
---
So it’s the friends you are playing with in your guild that keep you around and not the actual content of the game
---
It's a narrative director responding, mind you. He might as well mean that they have future stories prepared of which I have no doubt, but the main issues are anything but the story.
---
Unlocking waypoints really doesn't take much with mounts. We need a heart completer in store.
---
Why would I do the story on multiple characters if I didn't enjoy doing the story? Why would I run around the open world if I didn't enjoy dynamic events. I enjoy plenty of stuff in this game, it's just better with other people. I still play when no one else is around.  Nice try though.
---
So how the hype?
---
You can't have a map for a road that may suddenly change and take a different turn at any given time.
---
For a scripted TV show that gets recorded ahead you know what will happen for the entire season. In GW2 they don't even freaking know how things will end up until they get released.  
---
There's countless examples of inconsistencies that are result of things changing shortly before release clashing with leftovers of older designs, from Polearms to how the Spirit Essence 101 tutorial makes players think they need to gather the essences to open the chests.  
---
Under these circumstances, at most all they can do is being rather nebulous about what's coming. "A mastery about the spirits of the wild", "new story in the shiverpeaks", "new expansions-level content", "really cool things", "something to shake up the meta".  
---
I see doing that too much that as a mistake, tho. 
---
Look how communicative the Diablo IV team has been, even though they are so early in development, they are getting tons of feedback that will help them improve their designs, and most players are aware that things may change a lot from what they have shown so far, specially comparing DIII with its early designs.   
---
If ANet had given a preview of the template system early, we would have been able to point out how unfinished and unserviceable as it is now before it got released.
---
even if the merch section wasn't a third of the show, it still had very little substance in it anyway. just read through [this](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/whats-next-for-guild-wars-2/) and list the differences to the live announcement, and why those differences are suddenly worth a *huge live announcement in a rented out theatre and that gets hyped up more than any expansion announcement before it, including two distinct spam mail reminders and a 24h (or was it 48h?) live countdown.*
---
Because they don't care about that content. They don't want to sit and look up builds on a website and use the prescribed rotation.  I mean some do, obviously. I use builds from meta battle, but open world builds mostly. When we were doing the escort everyone took raid builds from the guild that was listing them before Snow Crows.  
---
My experience was, not everyone showed up every time, because you know, we're a casual guild. We don't do schedules or be there at a certain time. So every time we'd be short 3 people that had set up. Every time. So we'd take people not geared, not trained. And you know, muddle through. It was tiring. 
---
You know doing guild missions, you show if you want. No commitment. You don't really have to be there. Having a raid team, that's a bit different. Even getting 10 people in the guild who were interested in raids in the first place was a challenge. It's just not our content. Not sure why that disturbs you.
---
Some people play baseball on a professional level, some people play casual baseball and some people just play catch. Who cares?
---
I strongly recommend to make the time to at least view the first few videos in WP's series, as they go over the general mechanics and strategies for builds, and actually explain *why* you do that instead of just presenting the results out of context.
---
I do!
---
Since 2006. 
---
I prefer when I open programs and do stuff the bottom thing I see is the frame all around the screen and not the taskbar. I dont know why, feels better this way 🤷‍♀️
---
Well we know what they are "working on". Which is absolutely everything imaginable because everything is on the table. 
---
What I would like to see is a vague outline of next 3 months. A monthly blogpost showcasing some of the stuff in the next update. For example a bit of the next map with some fluff about what inspired them to make it, proper screenshot of whatever instance or a boss they are working on, a community highlight of something people posted on reddit or forums be it quaggan of their favorite color made out of sand or a speedrun of a fractal. Its not much but at least it is some way to engage and inform people without setting a deadline or spoiling entire season.
---
And both Grothmar and Bjora have the old entrance of an Eye of the North dungeon within them.
---
While in Bjora is just a sad place, in Grothmar we see a ghost pulled back towards the dungeon. Why pulling the ghost there instead dispersing her if there wasn't at least some plan to eventually have an 'inside' of the dungeon?
---
I don't just press 1 on story missions. I used more skills. So does most of my guild. I just don't follow a "rotation". I mean if I need to heal I heal. If I need to remove conditions I do that. If I have a skill that does more damage, of course I'll use it. Why wouldn't I?
---
I'm not saying you can't have both. I am saying that the more you put of one thing the more disenfranchised one side or the other games. Raiders aren't happy with the amount of content their getting, but in the 9 months after HOT launched, all we got were raids and PvP tournaments and I know for a fact that cost the game players.  Because people see that's what's out and they think the game isn't for them anymore. Pretty much what you're going through, so I can sympathize.  The thing is, you start locking rewards behind those raids and in a game that I bought were I could get pretty much everything for the first 3.5 years, suddenly I can't. The game feels less like my game. I left Rift because it channeled me into raids too. I want to play a game focused on the open world. That's what Iv'e always wanted.
---
They are also hiring to update the engine for Lineage 2 on PC (Unreal engine), so they seem to be doing lots of different things.
---
It's too late. It won't be possible to stop negativity snowball. No matter what they do it will be only worse. They already wasted their chance. They may develop many cool features right now and change Guild Wars 2 into perfect mmorpg but noone will care anyway. They will remain forgotten. Most of the people won't trust them anymore. Guild Wars 2 died in mainstream gaming media.
---
All BS! If there was any major positive news they'd scream it from the rafters considering the state of the game and community today. They don;t have anything major to announce and they know it, this is just devs doing everything they can to hold on.
---
They need to give a road map / path forward with real details or just shut the hell up, nobody cares about these stupid little hints with zero substance anymore!
---
Like the "hardcore casuals". They're not casual in terms of investment in time or effort. They're casual in terms of skill and demands of other players.
---
It's an euphemism for playing is if performance is irrelevant. Which in itself is fine. But quickly becomes toxic when they care about the performance of the groups they join, the rewards they get, balancing, ...
---
Let's not forget GW1 wasn't really an MMORPG, and there's MMORPGs running since the 1990's and still getting updates. Not 'maintenance mode' updates like GW1 with GWBeyond which only head a few new assets and reused most of the content, but actual new content. 
---
And it's not like you need a subscription to keep the game running. Even Ultima Online got a free to play option eventually, years after getting a new engine in 2007.
---
I would not mind having to pay for GW2 again if we got a "Tyria Reborn" game that is basically GW2 with an updated engine and all account unlocks carrying over like with Overwatch 2.  
---
And maybe some other improvements like merging all maps into a seamless world made by splitting each map into smaller chunks and having each chunk load around your character, like how WoW, minecraft and Bethesda games do it.
---
It’s a fair point there’s definitely room for casuals like you and what you enjoy but I don’t see how not wanting or bothering about you build is a good thing or should encouraged. What’s the point of traits. What the point of your build if it doesn’t matter. Just get rid of builds. Just get rid of anything meaningful and impactful and make everything bland and contain no meaningful content or punishments or progression and watch the game slowly die and people loose interest and leave. If you enjoy it fair enough but my point is that I don’t think it’s healthy for the game and I don’t think that’s this is the way forward to keep players interested and playing as a whole
---
They said otherwise [there](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/d1web4/full_english_translation_for_the_german_interview/) though.
---
I was instantly reminded of this:

---
&gt; When? Late 2020 or 2021
---
Why not 2022 or 2077 when you at it?
---
k
---
They remove a feature, readd the feature on request of the players and you find this impressive?
---
Sorry if you have 2 to 3 buttons and a screen you can reliably outperform 90%+ of openworld players.
---
Hell why not make it "tap screen to kill enemy". Sounds like it would cater to more casuals, aka perfect!
---
Yup, SC benchmark get 80k-90k hit when fully buff. You can get even higher with the right trigger at the right time and buff but that demand group composition and timing. Exemple: You could abuse Guardian traits Perfect  Inscriptions and Signet of Bane (that give 216 Power to 5 targets for 10 secs).

Cool story bro

No wonder there's no content in coming to this game anymore
---
Yikes....

The fractals and raids teams are gone.....this game is done

Hahaha I've had this "giant mini" glitch before but yours is pretty good https://imgur.com/rI0yHVD
---
Milking fashion hard is in line with many popular and succesful games. 
---
Wanna release some skimpy KDA skins to milk horny teenagers, weebs or casuals? Go for it.
---
I'd rather get good gameplay and them milking fashion to fund it, than what we have right now.
---
Which is very little gameplay AND milking fashion regardless.
---
The negativity has been like this since lws 1. Guess what, most people avoid the reddit bitch fest and just play the game.
---
This tickled me
---
Sadly I have to agree. 
---
It's best to release like three Story parts and then announce an expansion instead of falling for something like the WvW alliance fiasco. 
---
The people who announced it are probably not even at the company anymore. 
---
The rest may be thinking: "If we did something like that, it'd probably wreck some aspect of the game, be it people leaving because most people love to fight for a server, which noone may have bothered to check beforehand. Or take tons of resources which are currently unavailable. Or mess with monetisation, like server transfers becoming moot."
---
 No one said anything about being surprised, I'm merely stating that anets approach to the game and communication clearly isn't and hasn't been working, you can see this for yourself in how the game continues to rapidly decline. One game continues to grow and have great communication between the devs and players, the other continues to have terrible communication between devs and players and continues to decline, the games being different genres is irrelevant.
---
Few players are going to wait an entire YEAR between fractal and raid releases. They're going to find something else to play and never come back.
---
&gt;Guild Wars 2 died in mainstream gaming media.
---
The same media that claimed the Sega Dreamcast was going to win the console wars?
---
Very impressed with how fast that was fixed. I hope they can address the way Legendaries get screwed. Once they've fixed that somehow, I'll be happy enough.
---
They're in a too little too late scenario. Isnt that sad? :)
---
Witch hunter or the like would be sick.
---
Not really. If they actually put out the same again, we get significantly more Strikes, skins, gear, etc as if they were to just make one HUGE map.
---
Guardians need 2h shield to protect their allies more properly.
---
i have the taskbar hidden aswell, but it still appears at the bottom when i move the cursor there.
---
First, thank you. You're literally the first person that's not offended by this joke and actually writes something useful for people who might think the same way. 
---
Besides that I highly disagree that it doesn't need to be good in PvE. We've come to a state of the game where PvE is the only thing we seem to focus on. Which is pretty sad but that also means we should encourage the revival of the lost elite specs and classic classes.
---
lol
---
Your heal mantra gives you instant cast aegis for a block. Are you using your F2-3 tomes defensively? F2 has essentially spammable cleanse, and F3 has resistance and a few more skills with aegis.
---
Bear in mind that condi quickness FB is practically a dps build, so there's no defensive choices taken. If the mesmer you used to play was a support chrono, don't expect to feel anywhere near as tanky.
---
Also, part of it is probably due to the break as well. It takes a while to re-adjust to the game and get back to the same skill level you were at before.
---
Alternate artwork title: Beardad does not approve of daughter's wardrobe choice for party, colourized.
---
Maybe it’s a whole underwater expansion with the _current_ underwater fighting mechanics!
---
Nice... Hairs.
---
Usually people who speak and pretend it's rose tinted glasses werent there themselves, I loved hot because it gave me stuff to do, was an update to it needed? Yeah, deffinatly! The only thing it really lacked was gold rewards though, and really, as someone who had 3000g safed up at the time,I didn't care. Having a new borderland and a new pvp game mode also made Hot have more variety. Sadly alot of people will deny this and deem Path of No Content the better expansion because they could get their 100% map complete easier
---
:)
---
ah, I guess this is another account from someone who claimed it was their last post in this subreddit, because they were done with the game. well, doesn't seem like it.
---
Gorgeous screenshot! Happy cake day!
---
&gt; imagine if balthazar could only be defeated in a raid, it would be AMAZING
---

It reminds me my favourite char name - Born Noobs   ^_^ Btw what costume/outfit is this? I wanna wear my norn female warrior like this.

We have stories, we don't need more of the same, we need something that honestly isn't a story, but a feature, content, something to do for gods sake.

---
&gt;I don't have options for cleanse and block.
---
?
---
Mantra of Solace gives you block and Radiant Recovery (F2,skill2) is your cleanse or cast Stalwart Stand (F3,skill4) to get resistance. You won't go far with firebrand if you don't know what your abilities do.
---
But he assigned the project leaders, and OK'd the projects themselves. One or two failed projects you can chalk up to the individuals, but we're talking about multiple projects here.
---
If he kept putting devs on bad projects under bad management, that's absolutely his fault.
---
Ok you might be right about that last part hahahanowimasadpepo :(
---
well I did. I wrote " My restrictions were PvP lobby fighting a Golem, no food or buffs from outside sources"
---
Ik that the balancing in between gamemodes differs. Thats why I choose PvP lobby. Might be fun to find something to run in casual play for fun just one hitting unsuspected players with one big **uhmpf**
---
Are you totally without brains? That's literary the same post we've been getting this whole time, while the game is dying...
---
Does it even have a default keybind (to be hit accidentally)? I have binded mine for so long that I forgot how accessible and intuitive it is for new players.
---
Being dedicated doesnt mean you'll play no matter what.
---
Your sois belle et tais-toi attitude doesnt help the game.
---
&gt; Dwindling fractal and raid content makes things look dead. 
---
I don't know why people keep saying this as if it makes any sense. Dwindling fractal and raid content is one of the best signs this game's given in years, because it means that those resources are likely shifted towards making the *game* better.
---
I wish we could convert all the wasted energy these people spend making these posts into electricity.
---
We could probably power a small town or city for several decades.

Well in that case he should have replaced the person that was. At the end of the day he was the president, and these were not isolated events.

Everything is streamed including build preview and we have staff keeping eye on the players making sure people respect the rules

Way to make this about you and your head-in-ass politics.

Thanks. I'm trying to figure out how much is me not knowing how to play the class and how much is the different feels between the two classes
---
Way back when Southsun just landed, I recall doing about *300,000* with an Eviscerate ~~to a tropical bird~~.
---
Thanks for the advice. I just started playing firebrand this weekend and there's a lot of different things to juggle. Before I took my break I was playing support Chrono or staff Mesmer (which was a super easy build).
---
It sounds like your advice is to use the F2 and F3 tome abilities more and get comfortable with swapping in and out.
---
Then don't come back. Personally, I've been playing since before day 1 and I've left the game plenty of times, caught up on life and other games and then come back and caught up on GW2. It's a rational and pragmatic approach to life in general, not just GW2, and you would be wise to apply it to your life.
---
&gt;You mean like bouncing mushrooms, updrafts, itzel poison lore, all exalted masteries, Rollerbeetle's barrier smash, Skysclaes rift repair and almost all LS3 masteries?
---
Yes and no. I greatly dislike these masteries because they are so limited and I thought it was overwhelmingly dumb of anet to make map features into exclusive masteries. 
---
Stuff like Sigil of agony, bonds, mount abilities, gliding ect, are the kind of masteries that are impactful and feel like some sort of progress and that's the kind of stuff I'd definitely want to see more of.
---
However, despite the drawbacks that these masteries had, they actually had a few advantages over the raven bond. 
---
For one, these masteries were not handed to you from the get go, you actually had to earn them, making them meaningful.
---
Secondly, because you actually earned them, the reward they gave was far more significant, they unlocked otherwise inacesible parts of the map, massively eased exploration and (in the case of mushrooms) gave you various advantages that were quite significant.
---
Would I have prefered something more universal? Sure. But these masteries are definitely better than raven bond which could literally be removed from the game and nothing would change.
---
If you remove the updraft mastery and updrafts, suddently map exploration becomes a lot harder and a big ammount of maps lose verticallity and exploration potential. Same for mushrooms.
---
If you remove raven mastery and doors while allowing chests to be freely opened, literally nothing changes.
---
Personally, I wouldn't bother with Revive Orbs for Migraine. I'd just take some Instant Repair Canisters. In my opinion, use of Revive Orbs takes the fun out of the challenge. Besides, the Instant Repair Canisters are significantly cheaper; one can buy nine of them for about the same price as one Revive Orb.
---
&gt; Since when do we have actual templates instead of loadouts
---
Since the build template release. The build storage are the actual templates. 
---
&gt; and since when are build- and gear-loadout slots account wide unlocks?
---
I never said that?...
---
things and stuff
---
Not sure why you got downvoted. But road maps never do anything but give the community a reason to bitch. The Division 2 had a roadmap and that game got completely shredded. Same with Anthem. Road Maps are stupid because anything can fucking happen within a company. A major developer could quit. A director could quit etc.
---
"Whiteknight" is just code for a political agenda used to demean and dismiss good or well meaning people because they're not on board with your poor attitude and rude behavior.

not sure how usefull it is now that we have mounts(see beetle/griffin speed) but could be great for newer players i guess?
---
That would be a good little mix up, Throw in some good rewards too! They could make what Evers being said to be phased to your character. So when your being talked to the convo can referenced the fact that your the chosen one. Everyone else is just a mercenary or just helping you. much like when your exploring the new map and only you can see Braham talking to you.
---
You can already start packing your boxes and send them to ManaWorks instead...
---
Account bound ones are templates. Don't be a scrub.
---
Your ignoring something NCSoft makes lineage in house so they can do this.
---
Nice data, matches your agenda.
---
There's zero bullshit in my post but if you didn't like it I can only assume you must be one of those people who focuses on a tiny part of the game.
---
You referred to my post, I was referring to these two things. Your comment then reads like that for me. 
---
Long story short: I want actual templates, not loadouts. We don't have -BUILD-templates one can just load and change some things, not messing with the original template. A build isn't just skills and traits.
---
Well I'm not the one running around calling others names so..
---
IKR!!!
---
Like what did they expect? dude is fucking buying the raid...
---
Not to be racist, but he's a dwarf. Of course he's got a hammer!
---
Yup, it's 'we don't need roads' if I remember right
---
The reason to continue for inexperienced players should be improvement. This is the entire purpose of the new game mode.
---
GW2 Efficiency lists stats of how many players have certain materials and such. It's also been made pretty clear that it's harder to find active play in the PvP modes, but the open PvE modes are doing just fine. I mean, more research is needed, sure, but the available evidence seems to indicate that the modes I listed apply to mostly 10% of the players or less.
---
Woah, settle down there, Satan.
---
I honestly love it because I'm too lazy to waypoint and I don't want to be a burden by doing nothing but upscaling the mobs!
---
I've been playing constantly since launch, and haven't entered PvP or WvW in over two years (and not a ton before that). My only raiding experience is a few hours attempting Vale Guardian and Goreseval. Would I *like* to have been able to experience the rest of the raiding content? Yeah, but they have yet to release an easy mode that does not require "gitting gud" or "gitting carried." 
---
&gt;So yeah, we all play story at some point in varying degrees, that doesn't mean story is the most important aspect of the game.
---
But it is the part that most players likely care about more than PvP, WvW, Fractal, and raid.
---
Ok, and?
---
Despite the Gem Store being unpopular with some people I do like that GW2 does allow you to convert ig gold to gems so you can earn any of it through gameplay. Most games will only accept real money.
---
Again, the game is doing just fine. Their quarterly revenues are the same as after HoT. There's no reason to believe that they will decline significantly. *You*  don't like the way the game is going, that should not be confused with an objective reality.
---
People in map chat were looking for guides last week 30 minutes after the patch dropped!
---
I like the tattoos! They work well with the top.
---
Thanks for the video. Watching a clap while not being under pressure is always good. The ice prison attack gets telegraphed by the boss leaning forward and lifting his left arm. I struggled to find the telegraph mid battle.
---
Well, it depends on how it would be implemented, I suppose. If there is a purely dedicated PvP slot that can only be used for PvP, in addition to the existing slots, then I guess it would b fine to auto-switch to it. But if a "PvP slot" is taking up one of the existing slots, and the game automatically switches to it when I go into PvP, I might not want that, I might not want to use that slot for that purpose.
---
While chrono is certainly a good class to learn raids with, it's also the hardest as many mechanics fall on to the chrono and a good chrono can make a raid so much easier (Managing cc, pulls, boosting uptimes, tanking the best way). Keep that in mind, a DPS can Focus purely on the mechanics and it won't hurt the raid  as much.
---
Now, assuming you want to stick to chrono, follow some simple General things:
---
- While tanking, always Focus to dodge with sword 2 and block with shield/sword 4. The less you move the Boss the better.
---
- Also while tanking, rather take more defensive stats than offensive stats for the beginning. Don't die.
---
- Pulls are extremely important. At vg you can pull the orbs away, for gorse and sab you can pull adds into the Boss. Sloth spawns many grubs and they are one of the biggest sources of damage and put a lot of pressure on your squad if you dont clear them, Bandit trio has tons of ads and helps to make it quicker. Don't use pulls on mathias, as the phantasms block projectiles and you dont wan't that. For escort, pulls save a lot of time too and you can pull during Tower the ads out of the circle, you can help pull/push out the orb during KC, xera has many ads and it also adds a lot of pressure. Use sword only when pulls aren't needed.
---
- Don't use pull as cc when pulls are needed soon. The pull is a relatively weak cc and never worth to have ads on you
---
- Put wells properly. Seriously, place them where your subgroup is, hopefully very Close around you. 
---
- Use your Rotation when it's needed. It's important to give out quickness ASAP, alacrity is second priority. Having quickness during the opening of a Rotation is a huge difference. Also know when phases are coming, delay the wells whenever you know: The Boss will be moved and there is no way everyone is going to benefit from the wells.
---
-
---
thats my point as well, story isnt good content for the game but it sure looks great in their stats when majority of players play through it. idgaf about the story, actually havent played the new one because im gone since the "huge announcement"
---
Yes, already said it like 2 years ago, even with the perfect update for all game modes, 1000 devs doing massive content, it's too late, so just stop care, take the game as it is and play it or not, going down into negativity will only be bad for you.
---
It only implies that they are aware you are unhappy. A promise that the next stuff coming out will be good is both an opinion and an attempt to calm the customer down.
---
Unless they specifically admit it like "We know it was bad", then you're only fooling *yourself* when you assume they think the work "wasn't good enough".
---
Never played gw2, and tried different email too
---
I wish, its mostly just the same daily whine thread getting most of the hype
---
No, but a lot of possible reasons you might try. You won't find any official statement here. If that is what you are looking for contact the game's support.
---
Tell me about it.
---
I played as condi firebrand because there were 3 other healers already.
---
When the boss died the squad was 8 people, and 3 of those were dead. I remember thinking "if i was HB noone would have died".
---
&gt; I don't understand the downvotes on this post.
---
Obviously, I can't speak for why anyone has downvoted you, but you have managed to hit a trifecta.
---
* People are tired of posts on this topic that add nothing to the discussion.
---
* Your post is a violation of rule2 of this subreddit, "Please do not post image macros".
---
* Your post is a violation of rule3 of this subreddit, "Please do not post to stir up drama".
---
So, that's at least 3 unsurprising reasons why somebody might downvote you.

DON'T BELIEVE HIS WORDS GUYS HE SPECIALISES IN NARRATING
---
They know a lot more about their product than the people disparaging it (which was my original point in my first reply to you). So they're a lot less likely to assume that the vocal minority, who barely knows a small fraction of information, knows better than they.
---
"Basically, if you can't LFG and casually clear it within 15-20 minutes, they aren't interested." - that's their problem, maybe a single player game on easy mode should suit them better.
---
But let me summarize your reply - I am a problem because I want an MMORPG to be what an MMORPG should be, instead of a casual-solo-press111 simulator with no real challenge and barely any replayability value at all.
---
Aight imma head out I guess.
---
&gt;So if we completely ignore the actual sale of the expansion then yes, you're right that the quarterly revenues are the same as after HoT. The problem is that you can't ignore those sales.
---
Well, ANet is. I mean, I think it would be irrational for them to expect the sales to shoot up this quarter without actually requiring a $50 purchase of anyone, right? So them releasing Icebrood the way they are is them saying "we are fine with this, we are fine with the sales we're having at the moment." Now do they have plans to spike the revenues up somewhere? Perhaps, but we haven't seen them yet. 
---
Another thing worth keeping in mind here is, if you take the "baseline" of 2015 as being "around $17m per quarter," which seems accurate, and then shave that amount off of their HoT quarters revenues as "what an average quarter brings anyway," then the total they got off the expansion alone would be in the ballpark of a bonus $23m. That's nice and all, but if you then split that amount over the five quarters between HoT and PoF's revenue spikes, the average quarterly revenue over that period if HoT had just rolled out as a non-expansion LS update? ~$17m per quarter, same as before HoT. So there is some mathematical *indication* that they could afford to do without that spike in revenue, *if* those numbers spread out over later content. They need to add an expansion's worth of *content* every now and then but maybe a $50 box is an unnecessary part of it.
---
My only point is, *the game is not in decline.* In *decline* would mean that the "basic" quarterly revenues would be well below the standard GW2 quarter, it would indicate that there are far less people playing, far less people *paying* for staple purchases. It's not an exact science, but it's fairly safe to assume that if quarterly revenues in 2019 are roughly the same as in 2016, then roughly the same number of people, or more, are playing the game right now, and there's no indication that this will change for the worse any time soon.
---
&gt;Even the fucking dev whose tweet this post is about used the phrase "I hope you can hold onto a tiny ray of hope." ArenaNet is notoriously out of touch, and even they understand the situation more clearly than you.
---
Here's my understanding of the dev's post. He is the Narrative Director. He knows where the story is going. He can't tell *us* where the story is going, because that would be spoilers, but *he* thinks it's very cool. He has a general idea of the future plot, he has a general idea of the locations we can expect, and he probably knows something about the game mechanics and art and stuff, but who knows if that's factored into what he's talking about. All I expect is that *he* thinks the story to come is cool, *but* he can't say more than that, he can't tell us *why* he thinks it's cool because that's spoilers. 
---
Think of it like Infinity War. It was a big, shocking ending, but they couldn't tell anyone what was going on for a year. But millions of people felt that the payoff was well worth it. I hope this will be worth it too, and their Narrative Director seems to think so (not that he's comparing it to Endgame).
---
i disagree pvp builds Work well in Open world and in smallscale wvw die to the in pvp necessary stunbreaks and condi cleanses you are ready for anything the game throws at you
---
I *think* the European numbering system is different; periods are commas and commas are periods. So 17.396 = 17,396 (17 thousand :o). Although, you maybe you already knew that and were just commenting on their massive amount of emails 😛
---
Build is explained at the end of video ~6min
---
Yeah you didn't even understand the original comment in the first place, I don't expect anything else from you
---
Out for a run and I see a Jacaranda
---
Now I'm on the gound all a' dazed and a dyin'

Then from afar comes another Jacaranda

HEEEEY Jacaranda!

There have been times where I'll be standing there, minding my own business, contemplating what I'm doing next. Suddenly I get knocked down out of nowhere. I look around... Nothing...
---
The first time this happened it took me ages to realizes there was some hidden in the bushes Jack A. Randa knocking me down once every 87 minutes.
---
Am I a big fan of the build template debacle? No. Do I still enjoy and support the game as a whole? Yes. It's provided me with hours and hours of entertainment over the past 4 years with no subscription fee. I won't be buying build template slots, but I'm perfectly fine with supporting it for all of the content and reasons I do enjoy the game.
---
This has been going on since HoT. "Alas, it has been 3 years since i was spotted by a mushroom, and yet I am still in combat...."
---
The liquid gold you got for the event, which at the time was typically 4g. Considering the pugs were getting LD, loot and occasional ascended out of it at no real cost, most happily paid. We didnt write down names or track stuff so scammers did happen.
---
I had little to no issues filling up these groups through lfg after adding "SELL RIVER - 4G - FREE LD". 
---
Kick people who are too dumb to /ff after asking and continuously fuck up your solo or duo. Cant help those.
---
He's also missing the fact that when the population drops off enough, those whales that buy all the gemstore shit to show off their e-peen to the masses will stop buying when no one is there to care.
---
&gt;now it's balanced around one player
---
The other dungeons need this done to them as well. They're personal story trapped outside of the personal story and need integration.
---
Is this "Macareena" inspired?
---
Learning to use all your tomes is the biggest curve. Guardian is a squishy class due to a small health pool. Really learn your tome skills and how to use tome 2/3 defensively. Of course dodging and timing aegis can be very good too, but you should also expect to have a healer in group content, and they should be supporting you because you are DPS, and therefore you are going to be squishy. If you enjoy those tomes, maybe consider healbrand in the future. It is my preferred way to play FB.
---
It's hard to define that with numbers until after it's happened, though, so it's not really something that will change his mind right now. Not that I really think that's possible with what he thinks of the rest of the playerbase.
---
... did you even read the post? because it seems like you didn't.
---
I don't know, I completed all the story chapters available, took down Scarlet and three Elder Dragons, got map completion on all available maps, made a few Legendary weapons, I feel like I've been playing the game seriously. I just never enjoyed the PvP or instanced group content. I came ot this game to play story and open world stuff.
---
Did you forget the argument being made? Since it's not being regularly covered in gaming media it's dead.
---
What you mean is the PvP and WvW part of GW2 continues to decline since they're focusing on LW and Gem shop.  Unfortunately that's what you get when you go after the 3 billion people that play games on their mobile phones, games that you can play, leave, come back and play again.  I'd go after that market too, because if you can harness it on PC you'd have a cash cow.  I know how WvW went downhill, I played it in the beginning, but when I saw how they changed EotM(from what it had been in testing) I gradually stopped.  I've never been big on PvP, hence the rabbit level, not even in GW1, that's just not my game.
---
Ok.
---
&gt;The game isn't being tailored to me so it's shit.
---
Good point, I don't know what the fuck Abernathy was thinking telling a hardcore endgame player "cool shit is coming" if all he was talking about was more shit like Aurene's "death" (since that's what Anet thinks passes as amazing writing). If what you're implying is correct then Anet are even more out of touch than we thought.
---
"You are a good lad Tom, but idk, ppl like kitten like a specific type of content. Between your words (which are appreciated) and interviews with the company stating that such content isnt comming for a while leaves us in a very weird spot." - a reply
---
I automatically replaced "kitten" with "shit" because of the forum censors and was super confused until I realized Kitten was the name of the original commenter that Tom replied to xD
---
I couldn't give a shit about story, if there is no good endgame to back it up.
---
If we figure out what the tweets mean, do we get a new way to get two blues and a green?
---
And what data do you have? Either way, you know what *I* find funny? How people who "complain" are told to just quit the game if they don't like it, and how people who *have* quit the game are at the same time told that they have no credibility as far as voicing criticism goes. It's almost as if you want to achieve the very thing that Azozel claims the "complainers" want: an echo chamber.
---
"you got any games on your phone?"
---
What was wrong with Aurene's death?
---
This worked! Thanks a ton
---
Exactly. I can't, in good conscience, suggest to any friend of mine that they should play this game, because I'd be telling them to essentially waste their time and money on something that might not even be online in 2 years' time at this rate.
---
The tiny gw2 population is irrelevant.
---
They can pretend and roleplay all they like, they're a minority on the videogame market.
---
But even compared to other MMOs. A revenue compared to aion lol.
---
Meanwhile most players dont know the game exists or think it died soon after release. And the more they know about the game, the more likely they don't have any faith in anet... as this sub represents.
---
Keep in mind to toxic casuals everyone is always a minority except for the single map theyre on. Pvp is small. Raids are a minority. Wvw isnt worthwhile. Reddit is tiny. Forums too small. Other games ? Not a comparison! Twitch?  External content? Sorry casual game! 
---
Then you point out theres fewer and fewer players? NOOOOOOOO THAT CANT BE TRUE. GAME IS BETTER THAN EVER. Well except in EVERY metric or indicator. But those are just all not accurate or proof enough.
---
You asked proof? Revenue down down down, on par with MMOs on life support. Anet firing a third of their studio. No new xpacs or reveals coming, just more gemstore and occasional LS.
---
Which is better proof than anything you provided.
---
Personally, I have to disagree with this. I hated almost every time your camera is being forced to move a certain way. Be that in those instances or the Zoom factor being adjusted in some certain encounters or situations.
---
This is great if you have certain "panorama" shots like when you fly across Kralkatorric which was pretty damn awesome but when you are going for achievements and your camera does things you don't want it to do while you can't see where you are standing AND THEN have to avoid certain AoE effects... it gets frustrating.
---
So I think while it can help to make some situations more dramatic it shouldn't be used in any way the player can actually interact with the game or vice versa.
---
This is why gods left Tyria.
---
Silence and the invitatation (Raven Sanctum part only ofc) would have been SO MUCH BETTER in 1st person.
---
It doesnt even need to be "forced". Just set the default there and le people change it if they want. (Maybe add a tooltip recommending using that).
---
The fact they spent weeks wanking themselves over how brave and audacious it was to take the story in that direction, and how they are giving characters meaningful deaths, then revive her within 5 minutes of the very next episode?
---
Some people (like me) can't play first person view because of labyrinth. So FORCED first person view is a huge no-no from me.
---
Optional first person view? It's been added years ago. Nothing stops you from using it.
---
In combat necro minion master says hi. We constantly stay in combat because there's no way to recall minions like you can a pet.
---
&gt; Right now, there is no info about anything 
---
It's clear to me that they aren't doing new specs or they would have said something about them in the announcement event. In fact if they were going to do more raids they probably would have said that they were coming at some point in the future. Same with fractals.
---
It seems to me like they have decided to only support the playerbase that gives them the best return on investment and disregard the rest.
---
If its only 45% he still doesnt need to take recall well, SoI extension will be enough. Ren F4 is base 6s so 9s with trait. 45% bd will give 13sec of alacrity and the cd id 16s so 1 extension will be enough
---
Yup, I read it and totally hear the music.
---
That's exactly what they want. Echo until they convince themselves they're the friendliest community, lovely casuals. Basically the chosen ones anet developed this game for.
---
Need some serious echo to actually believe that in a game where communication and interaction between players are avoided as much as possible.
---
Did you expect Spider-Man was dead forever in Infinity War too?
---
And since GW2 doesn’t have a subscription, microtransactions are more important, which is why the gem store is really obnoxious sometimes.
---
As we tried around we had like 20 people with all the subs and we maybe had 2 or 3 that had it geared.
---
Only siths deal in absolutes.    
---
I think that true path for any MMO game is balance between hardcore and casual content. Hardcore and casuals are not that far away from each other - many people drift between those categories (like playing very casually during the exams or hard times at work). If the game miss something - it makes players leave the game. Why do you think good MMO's never stop making content for both casuals and hardcore players? There are people in every game that scream "only 5% players are doing that content, whats the point". Any game feels dead without casuals and hardcore together.  
---
As for mobile market's whales don't worry - governments are already moving towards regulating casino-like while-milking monetization schemes.
---
That's fine.
---
Did I enjoy the game? Yes. 
---
Do I think anet will spend any money I could give them in an efficient manner to produce content I might enjoy playing? Nope.
---
Do I think they'll spend the money to produce more shiny skrit stuff to sell in the gemstore while neglecting the dire state of content in this game? Yup.
---
Soooooo, guess I'll have more money for drugs and hookers.
---
remember original agro distance in Bloodstone Fen? I remember... Also still have triggering PTSD/panic attacks when I fly or glide there ._.
---
Don't be thick, intentionally or otherwise. Spiderman didn't come back to life within 5 minutes of Endgame. The whole movie was about their struggle and effort to bring him back (and everyone else), and his death is a powerful influence the behaviour and actions of Stark the movie.
---
I feel this in my soul. There have been many times where I have been trying to get to a mastery point and keep getting hit by their attack....but I have no idea where the heck they are. Turns out they are on the other side of the rock I was trying to Springer up and I have no idea how they saw me. 🤷
---
Thanks for your guide!
---
A suggestion: for the collection-like achievements (like the Champion killer or the chest hunting ones), you might want to add a legend next to each circle on your map, for the people who are only missing a few items.
---
That thing is here for one reason only, so whales throw thousands at gems to gold conversion. When people convert gold to gems, gem price rises, so whales get even more reason to waste money.
---
Whaaaat?! But there's a Revive Orb for free!! /s

By Ogden's hammer! What shitposts!
---
I'm glad we found a way to break the monotone and predictable fluff only months with a spicy civil war between players. Really puts the content into gw2.
---
I read Born Boobs... I want to slap myself *facepalm*
---
They're doing it on Guild's Chat
---
&gt;Don't be thick, intentionally or otherwise. Spiderman didn't come back to life within 5 minutes of Endgame starting. 
---
He didn't, but the point was, a character death is not always permanent. Some characters in GW2 have had permanent deaths. Blish's hit me harder than most character deaths in any media, largely due to Debi Derryberry's performance. Aurene's didn't hit me all that hard, but I suppose if I'd been invested in that death it might have bothered me more that they reversed it so quickly in the next patch. I don't think it would have improved much to drag it out though, and getting right into Dragonfall ASAP was probably the right call.
---
My reading of that is "i'm going to send this to the VP and remind them again of our request to publish a roadmap". We see stuff like this a lot in my office. People need executive approval so they start getting passive aggressive about stuff. I've forwarded more than a few emails to my boss that includes someone's complaints and say "we should probably address this"
---
&gt; You referred to my post, I was referring to these two things. Your comment then reads like that for me. 
---
And I still never said something about account wide loadout unlocks. o.o
---
&gt; Long story short: I want actual templates, not loadouts. We don't have -BUILD-templates one can just load and change some things, not messing with the original template.
---
That's exactly what we got with the build storage. 
---
&gt; A build isn't just skills and traits.
---
Since GW1 and GW2 always differed between "build" and "gear" in terms of templates, builds *are* just skills and traits.
---
&gt;I stated before that GW2 is a great game as it is
---
That's like people in abusive relationships telling their partner they love them after beating the ever living shit out of them.
---
&gt;it barely meets the standards of an MMO.
---
FFXIV doesn't meet them at all, there's nothing massively multiplayer about instances and open world is completely dead.
---
&gt;Enjoy your gemstore, "fanboy"!
---
Mogu suteishon ga tanoshinde kudasai, hikari no senshi.
---
No one ever does
---
I can understand part of the frustration of it: GW2 gameplay is definitely not meant to be played in first-person, this is why I was specifying for "exploratory **non-fighting** personal story phases" (as you wrote about "encounters" or "avoiding AoE effects"). That said, your comment made me think that no matter what phase of the personal story, such control-taking of the camera might not be liked by everyone, even in the least-vigilance demanding situations. Potentially, an amendment I should make to my post would be to add a toggle of some sort in settings to "allow/disallow personal story's controlled camera".
---
Have you ever stopped to think that they actually just have no fucking plans atm?
---
It does not, unfortunately.
---
Not a clue, my guess they are busy with the new episode and polishing that.
---
I'm not saying you are wrong but unless you designed the system it I don't think you can say that is the only reason it exists.
---
It's almost as if she's a force of nature, and thus incredibly powerful....
---
Or alts. Make a new character (with a new class if you don't already have it), use the item, and smile as you have access to everywhere on that character.
---
The ring of fire missions in gw1 felt like a raid tbh. It took me 3 hours to clear the last mission and my group accrued max down penalty so we were at risk of getting stuck and needing to start over. I feel like I have a good appreciation of gw2 after spending thousands of hours on gw1 and understanding the evolution of the game systems, although I know tons of people who enjoy gw2 and never played gw1.
---
Just lol. You still don't get it. Nitpicking about terms instead of focusing on the actual gameplay relevant part of the discussion. 
---
But yeah, go ahead, whatever
---
Ignore this, metabattle openworld builds are memebattle meme builds for when being special and unique is more important than being useful.
---
There are good builds, but for every half decent build there are 2+ builds that arent better than a randomly generated set of traits, weapons and utilities.
---
You dont really want to drop SoI on a boss ever because it extends other important boons like retal for the dragonhunters.
---
&gt;Aurene's didn't hit me all that hard
---
Which is surely another indictment of their writing? You literally raised Aurene from an egg - a storyline that began before HoT - have *died* trying to keep her safe, and your feeling at her "death" was relative ambivalence.
---
For some reason I read that as "my mom", and wanted to call you a liar.
---
Geezus dude, come up for some air in between boot licks.
---
He's not protected by those discs though, his bear nipples will freeze off
---
So does the concept of relativity just like, blow your damn mind by chance?
---
no way they let the current season end with this patch. it's terrible
---
Mandela effect!  
---
(yes,it's "we don't need roads")
---
Everything is on the table.
---
Nothing is on the horizon.
---
Yep. Calculators do math to figure out ahead of time what's currently "cheapest". Either way, my point is 300-500 shouldn't take multiple hours
---
And yet wow is still the king of mmos.
---
They smelled your springer. It's a delicacy for plants, you know!
---
Heh. I've only heard of people buying the dhuum instance, as opposed to River credit.
---
Major balance patches tend to be quarterly. It's been that way for a long time.
---
By the way what they would tell us? That they're slowly going into maintenance mode? Really? I guess it's better to be silent in this situation.
---
so without adressing and fixing the incredible amount of bugs, errors, crashes, balance issues, neglected game modes dying and the disaster they cause with each new release of any kind of new feature, you want to leave all of it as it is right now and bring more overpowered, dumbed down and badly designed specs?
---
first, most players who actually think before purchasing won't buy it, specially veterans who know where this game is going
---
second, if releasing stupid build templates wrecked the game for a whole week, and still bring bugs and errors, or sometimes even crashes, no one would trust anet to deliver a complete expansion without breaking the game for good
---
third, most of anet fanbase is already looking elsewhere, countless posts about a possible gw3 were made, and most downvoted to hell, plus almost every player i read on those said, they would never buy a gw3 because they fear anet will go EA's path and monetize absolutely anything giving us a product quality that sucks
---
if they try and release a third expansion it would probably break the community in half, and one half would leave instantly to another game
---
and i agree with them, i wouln't buy a mmorpg where the only content devs push is a SINGLE PLAYER STORY MODE like wtf were they thinking focusing only on that, it's like they lost all the staff except the teams behind it so it's all they can do now
---
plus i don't trust anet can provde quality content anymore, i'd bet the team behind core gw2 and classes design has already left anet a long time ago
---
It's a good game if you like PvE.
---
The story is abit of a drag though.
---
Now imagine how much energy gw2 servers waste  to keep this game alive and how much money they waste. Those money would feed a lot of poor kids.
---
I’ve been watching a video of it just now actually some lady playing the Samurai
---
Do you enter your PIN number at ATM machines... redundancy
---
Zerk fb melts trash very effectively. Burn (viper) is strong on bosses. Also when there is trash nearby to reset f1. You can swap out one or two dps utils for active defenses if you really need them. If you solo take quickness mantra so you can burst more effectively. 
---
On fb, the main part is learning that preventing damage is easier than healing it back up. Using f3 or blocks or dodges to avoid damage isnt hard.  Healing up after you eat 8k dmg to the face is. Dont be afraid to use f3, blocks, ... to buff before you engage.
---
Once you get the hang of it you wont be dying often.
---
To perhaps read into things a little too much, I think a lot of the current playerbase's attitude towards ArenaNet is because the devs' actions can be perceived as arrogant. Although I don't think they intend this to be the case, their secrecy about new key features could be interpreted as, "We know exactly what we are doing, so we do not need to solicit any feedback before we launch it." This is especially egregious in the case of build templates, where the community had a better solution before ArenaNet implemented their own, inferior product.
---
This is why people pay so much attention to how ArenaNet responds to feedback (if at all); it is a test to see if they are willing to learn from their mistakes, or if they are just going to press on regardless without appearing to listen to the community. It would seem they are doing a lot of the latter, and although they may well be listening to feedback and incorporating that into new features (or changing existing ones), we do not really know because they never communicate clearly enough to draw a line between specific pieces of feedback and any resulting change.
---
We did the same thing with like 4 ppl of our guild when first strike hit. We got 3 ppl in and 1 rly paid for it. We did it for the memes and actually someone went for it. Some ppl can't be helped.
---
Maybe I'm just a quick learner.
---
Different goals for different people. I avoid river and such with pugs like the plague. I'll happily pay 10g for dhuum instance to avoid this.
---
But many will happily pay someone to do river for them.
---
Lack of endgame became the #1 complaint as soon as october 2012, maybe even before. And the game opened in august.
---
Back then ArenaNet believed that players would be happy to roll new characters and see events they missed. So they were expanding the core maps by -stealthly- adding new events. You may have stumbled upon Modus Sceleris. It was one of these.
---
Needless to say, they changed to LWS1 quickly and abandoned the 'living, breathing world' part of their manifesto gradually afterwards, until they finally froze maps in time starting LWS2.
---
Among other 'dead game' complaints of 2012 were the Ascended power creep (who if we believe the Reddit posts has cost them half of their dedicated players) and Gem Store greed (the first Black Lion Weapon set was hard to swallow, especially since it was a very rare drop from paid loot boxes).
---
Casuals raised their voices too starting 2013, when dredge attacks in the starting maps were 'driving new players away from the game'.
---
Danger lurks on the horizon, and when the time comes, you'll know we needed Jormag. And they're waiting.
---
A maxi.
---
Tbh reddit is the first thing I'm checking when I'm trying out a new game xD
---
When you switch to the F3 tome, do you use all the pages or just a couple and switch back? How do you find the balance between defense and offense? Is it just experience?
---
I want legendary swapping fixed more than anything else right now. I didn't make all the legendaries I have to have them be an inconvenience.
---
Perhaps. But given the current situation, it may very well be that focusing on casual players gives the best expected revenue.
---
I mean it's great to hear someone respond to concerns, but it's also really frustrating that the most any employees can tell us is "things are coming."
---
"You can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink." The rewards are there for the taking. It is possible that there are players that don't understand what rewards exist from what content, but the information is readily available on the wiki and there is a function to access the wiki from inside the game. You can't hold a 9 MM to the back of someone's head and *make* them do the content. 
---
Anecdotally, I'm am currently in the stages of preparing to join the raid community. My primary character is all ascended out with optimal stats, I've been practicing my build off Snowcrow and I can achieve about 80% of expected dps on golem. I've been pushing fractals so that I can get a feel for dodging and dps windows. I have been doing everything I can do to prepare, all I need now is to find the time and read the separate boss mechanics. But that's a bit out of reach for me right now since I can only really play one day a week
---
That's why as I wroted: they'll try to release new expansion but it won't work for them.
---
Do I need harriers for healbrand or can I get away with minstrels?
---
Also, do you have a build/rotation recommendation?
---
So animals basically
---
Only if those mails were queued like a couple months ago.
---
I think the game would benefit from trying to raise general awareness of what's going on - kind of like what Blizzard do for WoW on Twitter with their "this month on Azeroth" series ([example](https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/1168509006593372160)). Punchy content which is explicit, which I can watch and instantly get what is going on and why I might want to consider playing that month.
---
In fact, when I go on WoW's Twitter I usually just find announcements of what's going on, interspersed with some general discussion topics. The focus clearly shifts over time between whatever key subjects they want to promote - lately it has been the announcement of the next expansion and then celebrating 15 years of WoW. Again, the cool stuff is clear and not buried in a two-hour stream of devs sat on a couch.
---
When I go on GW2's Twitter, I see a mélange of fan art and giveaways being retweeted, esoteric promotions ([seriously?](https://twitter.com/GuildWars2/status/1199115787480555521)), and promoting the newest Gem Store items. Aside from announcements of streams, there's not a lot to tell me about what's going on actually in the game at the moment, so I do not really feel motivated to play. Where's the 30-second overview of the new zone, or what new things have come with this patch as a pinned tweet?
---
Of course, I acknowledge that a game's Twitter feed may not be an accurate reflection of the game, but how can anyone blame people for thinking the game is dead when a key window they have into the experience is so messy? An optimist could interpret this as, at best, a sloppy social media strategy that has to be reactive to whatever topic the higher-ups want to promote that hour, but I'm sure many people just think there's not a lot of real value in what's going on in the game, because if there was, why wouldn't it be promoted on social media?
---
So why are you here still? This game is apparently dead and unpopular and you hate it so just LEAVE, it's super unhealthy to be this fixated on something you don't like.
---
To address your last point, the icons [were used in build templates](https://i.imgur.com/zC33bR6.png), for the tool-tip that appears when you hover over an equipment template tab.
---
I think in general what you say makes sense, but idk about expecting elites. To be finished for ep. 3 in just a few months, they would have had to be in development for quite some time. Surely they would have talked about them?
---
Oh, It's called content these days.
---
well necro, then reaper
---
Oh darn, well that's a shame.
---
And to be clear, when I say "my expectation is elite specs", it's not really that I think it's highly likely they're gonna put them out. It's more like if they don't put them out, it's confirmation they've given up on the game by pissing away the excellent combat system they've created.
---
Im thinking about quitting but I didn't decide yet.
---
This.
---
I run minstrels because I made it for WvW, but I'll also run it in fractals and strike missions. Havent tried it in raids, but the dps of healbrand is not relevant, would just need to watch for toughness for tanking in certain raids.
---
There isn't really a rotation in SC as far as I am aware, it is more about knowing priorities, which SC does give I believe. Basically just cycle between putting down weapon symbols and staff 4 for might. Know when to use the tomes, and use quickness stuff off cooldown.
---
GW1 is still among my favorite games of all time. Hope you continue enjoying it!
---
&gt;you know why those resources should and must be spent in those kind of game modes and not casual pve?
---
Not sure if sarcasm or ignorance. . .
---
&gt;pve in this game has no replayability, unless you enjoy having a second job with no payment farming the same maps over and over again every afternoon, most pve players just log in for the new content, finish it and log out, then they wait, playing some other games until new content is released
---
This may be true. 
---
For you.
---
Just understand that for everyone nodding their head at this, there are a thousand other players happily replaying open world PvE every day. It might not have replay value *for you,* but it has plenty of replay value for *most of the people who play this game.* Meanwhile, content like Dungeons, PvP, WvW, Fractals, and Raids have ZERO replay value to these players, since they don't even play those modes ONCE. 
---
Yes, Anet has to spend resources freshening up this content every few months, but they don't have any other option. If they don't, then those thousands of players would leave the game, and without them, the game *would* collapse in exact the same way that it would *not* if all the PvPers and Raiders left. 
---
&gt;meanwhile pvp and wvw only demand two things overall others, stability (lag wise) and class balance, if they do those correctly wvw and pvp community would log in everyday, play everyday and enjoy, leaving opportunities to monetize that community somehow
---
And yet pages of complaining that these modes do not get enough new features and content. . .
---
They've been doing balance patches constantly this entire time, and often they are done with PvP balance first, WvW balance second, raid balance second, and everyone else is a distant afterthought. Maybe they haven't done it the way you wanted them to, but you can't argue they haven't *tried.*
---
&gt;but anet said screw all the veterans that have been playing our game for 7 years, lets just focus on the new meat, completely neglecting every end game content, and ignoring class balance
---
Lol, no, the thing you aren't understanding is that they ARE catering to the veterans who have been playing the game for 7 years. They're the open world PvE casuals. The "new meat" would be the raiders, and the PvP and WvWers are just not numerous enough to account for. I don't think they have much hope of attracting new players, but they do need to retain the ones they've got. The majority of them, at least. 
---
As for the "complaints on the forums and reddit," that might be part of the reason that they are downplaying PvP and raids, because that's where most of the whining comes from. Hopefully, once enough of those players leave entirely and busy themselves in other games, the community will stabilize again.
---
&gt;thats why the game is suffering,
---
Again, there is no evidence that the game is suffering. Revenues are roughly on par with the game's past five years. Current maps are well populated. The game seems to be doing just fine.
---
&gt;and how much they want to spend after realizing the game has no end game content, or quality/polish around it
---
&gt;as a reddit user said before "if i want a single player story mode i'd be playing the witcher 3 not this"
---
And for every one of those, and there will be some of those, there are a thousand other players happily playing in Bjorn Marches right now.
---
They still haven't fixed the dates? Somebody must've just copied the template from emails without reading it... again.
---
I had this phase once. But I stopped playing for quite some time.
---
Now I do it like this. If I have 2 back-to-back losses, I stop playing for the day
---
What is your secret?
---
I think I remember this lfg message.
---
Think you're forgetting that there are still new players joining, it's balancing itself out. Some come and some go, as with any game out there
---
Not everyone is going to like every game they play, op isn't happy with it so should go find a game they are happy with, instead of rambling on reddit about it
---
I"m gonna say the Bjora Svanir are what the Bitterfrost should be. Regular mobs shouldn't be able to get even close to 1-shotting, or 2-shotting a player.
---
Coffee Stain does it just because Factorio devs put the bar too high already.
---
Then they ruined it all by basically saying "we don't believe in our game, so instead of people buying it we take corporate money and seal it off on spyware launcher". Coffee Stain is not the dev ideal you look for.
---
Less talking, more doing would also help. They've been talking about stuff like WvW alliances for quite a while, after all.
---
That's why I put my taskbar on my second screen only ! :D
---
It's awesome to have a main screen without taskbar
---
Dude.  Didn't you promise me somethign 2 days ago?
---
I can appreciate the the revisited areas from GW in gw2, the first thing that comes to mind is the memory game teleporter that is a mastery in 2, or Justicar’s ghost still being in bloodstone fen. And I can see why people want to go to Cantha, loved the little story and the actual factions, now I understand the turtle mount :p
---
Overall a pretty cool boss! I jumped in straight after reset, and got a fun group. We wiped 4 times, but got gold on the fifth try.
---
(the underscore is silent)
---
Didn't they share discount in the post yesterday? It was like 20 or 40% or something like that
---
Gw1 is amazing but way different than Gw2 whoever hasn't tried it definitely should :D
---
you still won one game that the light in the end of tunnel
---
That was gw2 deluxe editions
---
There's more than enough mastery points to get all the masteries; it's not an exact amount.
---
Discout price for complete edition is 25 $/€.
---
Well, brainless or not, I am still excited about future and enjoy playing GW2 every day!
---
How's your brain doing? Impatient? Diagnosed ADHD? Energy drink addict? Worrying too much? Stressing out? Take it slow and relax. Don't worry. There is time.
---
Worrying raises stress levels and suddenly one day you notice you got permanently raised blood pressure and heart problems. Do you want that? Really? Stop worrying. Stop overthinking.
---
That's a mild amount of mildly temperatured air coming from his mouth :/
---
Huge natural muscle mass, maybe even without exercise. Could justify it as an unnaturally fast metabolism that keeps them warm
---
I was a hard core raider in WoW and let me tell you: putting the main story inside of raids is going to lead you down a very dangerous path. Look at how raids developed post 3.0. Those raids were super hard and a very low percentage of players could manage to complete them at all. Que Burning Crusade and you have a similar problem, so they remove the raid attunements because a statistically low percentage of players could beat the final bosses in T5 content. Moving into Wrath, they make a big push to make all bosses beatable by making 10 and 25 man content, but the content is being beaten too quickly so they implement Heroic difficulty. By the time Tier 10 (ICC) rolls around, there is a very clear single tier progression line from normal 10man to heroic 25man. They also start implementing a weekly increasing buff to allow groups to eventually push through the content on stats alone. Fast forward and you have what you have now: world first heroic kills within hours of a raid opening and people burning through mythic while yawning. By putting the main story in the raids, it necessitates that the content is doable by most everyone, which means the difficulty had to be dumbed down and the feeling of accomplishment has been cheapend. It is a fact that this happened, and a fact that it will happen again if you were to implement such a policy.
---
Now, here's the cool thing: Guild Wars has so much more than one story. Season 1 showed us how this was possible. Making the raids about non-dragon factions and telling their magnum opus story through the raid is fine. That is kind of what they do already. The problem is they've destroyed a lot of the good faction ideas they've had along the way. We are now friends with the Fire Legion and the Dredge, the Netherlands pirates have been disbanded. We've beaten the White Mantle so that's done. Joko and his Morden Cresent have been purged.the Zaishen have joined ranks with the commander to take down Kralk. We are running out of enemies. Centaur, Inquest, maybe some remnant faction of Stone Summit? A militant group of Tangy perhaps? Who do we bring down next that isn't Dragon-based?
---
Next year. We get Wintersday first.
---
there is exactly 1 more, which requires doing 15 meta events, so ice-bound would be faster to get. I didn't get mine either btw, a lot of ppl didn't, anet working on solution for a week now
---
oh man, well spotted. I never noticed this when I read the mail yesterday!
---
hey
---
2 more but ye.. both would take long - the meta one and the weapons collection
---
I'm happy for them being able to secure funding for developing Satisfactory. I'm just not going to be buying it on Epic and keep hoping that it ends up on Steam or GoG eventually.
---
Poe's law man, Poe's law.
---
They need to come back
---
I remember doing monthlies in just three days.
---
You received two suggestions about how to walk around the bug. You dont care about any of them. I am simply reacting to what you post. If you know about the bug, reject solutions, why are you even here? Just to complain?
---
Who the hell cares if they "know a lot more about their product."  If you are a business and people aren't buying your product then you need to change your product no matter how proud of it or whatever you are.  If you don't, you are a pretty terrible business.  Example, say I love anchovy cake and I have a bakery that sells anchovy cake but, surprise surprise, not a lot of people are buying my cake.  Guess I'll keep making it hoping people come around?  No, I'll bake something else that people will eat so I can make a little money.
---
I second this. Really miss Monthlies.
---
Same here, either I did them within the first couple days, or procrastinated until the last few, which made it all the more stressful
---
Oh that's right! Even better.
---
Add those wolf humanoid creatures with their perma CC-lock to that list. So annoying and they typically take away 90% of my hp.
---
This post made me go look.  Apparently I played 3 games in June 2018, then before that was July of 2017.  I’m so out of touch with that game mode.
---
Right? Like, dailies are great yet if you log in daily, you should have something more than a (Laurel) Chest at the end of that 30 day cycle
---
Not to mention the whole thing needs reworked and revisited
---
Forcing first person is a big no for me. To me, my character is not me, so playing in first person actually breaks my immersion: I enjoy seeing what a character is doing in a given setting (like watching movies), but don't like to have a sense of "be there" (like having dreams) because that means the absence of my character. In this episode, I think Anet has done a great job to make a creepy, mysterious atmosphere, and to me that's enjoyable enough.
---
Maybe, who knows...  
---
Also, If you read carefully you'd see  I asked for a way to get that specific masterypoint.
---
I feel it's much more balanced now, you should give it another go soon
---
Is the damage comparable to power off chrono? I assume you ran a condi chrono because the encounter was condi favored.
---
&gt;like Kas and Jory, but I don't feel like it's really that impactful to the story. Like if Kas was a dude then the story could be exactly the same. 
---
Why wouldn't/shouldn't it be?
---
While monthlies were great I think having weeklies would be better.
---
Forgive\_me,\_O\_wise\_one.
---
Try it on a &lt;10 ranger. I always go and pick up (most of) the PoF and HoT pets straight away whenever I make a new ranger. I join a random group in Verdant Brink and Crystal Oasis whenever I see one pop up and use a TP to friend and leave the group, then make my way through the expansion maps getting the pets at anywhere between level 2 and 10. Now *that* adds a sense of danger to the world, believe me lol! The only one I can't get is the cheetah (I think?) in the cave on the east side of the third map, it's filled with veteran corsairs that are nasty to try to get by with no space.
---
They won't be missed. Just look at that. Group events, crafting, puzzles, nothing specific. Just generic stuff that can get done in one day by running around grinding.
---
If something like monthlies is ever to return, it should be quarterly or 3 times per year, and reward doing a wide variety of different things, like every fractal level, every dungeon path, every world boss, dailies in every living world map, every jumping puzzle, every fighting every raid boss and defeating at least three, winning matches in every arena, winning skirmishes in every Mist War map, defeating players of every profession and elite specialization in competitive modes...
---
Have people do different things, and give them enough time to do them.  
---
It could be a neat way to let people eat some more Mystic Coins every year, specially now that we have tiered rewards in achievements.  The completion achievement could give 1 coin and 10AP on the first achievement, 3 and 30 on the next, then 9 and so on until at least half of the achievements are done, and the daily and monthly achievement caps could be split again into 15K for daily and and 10K for monthly. 
---
Otherwise it'd be pretty much pointless as it was when it got discarded.
---
They delivered the warclaw!
---
Which is arguably worse then nothing...
---
I wish this reddit existed.
---
i guess we will have to agree to disagree then... it feels as we are playing totally different games... i guess time will tell who knows better. good afternoon sir
---
Pretty sure I got my saddle from a failed anomaly event. Just cuddle with it, when it explodes and you should get it too!
---
Yup. Dead game.
---
Wow start playing again!
---
I think I still have two
---
even back that WVW had worst rewards :DD
---
What a nice experience he must have.
---
dont yolo into a 1vX. you'll never win
---
look at the minimap and team roster. if you see that your team has lost a fight, dont go there. wait and regroup with your team when they respawn if you want to attempt another push.
---
dont fight on enemy node if you dont have to. 
---
use a build from godsofpvp.net or metabattle.com. 
---
consider the enemy teams strength against yours. if they have a lot of strong team fighters, try to separate them to fight for side nodes. this is harder to do at low level though.
---
For your own sanity, keep it that way.
---
Please add to that the large groups of freaking pocket raptors.
---
37.5% off apparently.
---
It’s just kind of tired and childish I guess.
---
with no buffs from outside it's probably soulbeast's worldy impact with a bunch of modifiers stacked like precast maul and whatnot
---
Buying it later anyways just gives the message that they don't need to care about their players at all and will still get the game sold, just later. I personally won't support such, so devs in general at least pretend that players are important for them. Feel free to do otherwise though...
---
They would get money anyways if the game would be good (which looked as quite satisfied condition....)
---
on the table^TM
---
Which makes it dull and boring.
---
I do.
---
I would rather have the old monthlies, but the goals divided by 2 or 3, and turned into weeklies instead. So you do them more often than 12 times a year.
---
The second pale tree was supposed to be in HoT but got axed because of time/resource constraints.
---
My achievement panel sure does
---
We could have monthlies with a tier reward system like they gave us in bjora marches, instead of doing the easiest to get the meta achievement reward have a way that doing all of them be more rewarding than then grinding out 3-4 of the easiest
---
A tiny uptick from one quarter to another tells us nothing; notice the uptick in quarter 3 of 2018 followed by a a drop? You have to look at the trend.
---
For that matter, earnings reports tell far from the whole story. If this is your incredible data that "reflects exactly" what you've been saying, well, I'm not impressed. It's just something that you're spinning to support your narrative, when in reality it does not. It just doesn't tell us enough about anything. You could just as easily spin it to fit the narrative that ArenaNet is focusing on the gemstore to squeeze the last bit of revenue out of the game before it dies.

Call it Exorcist.

That and our society has fundamentally changed in the last couple of decades with the advent of smartphones and how tethered we are all to them. More time taking selfies and trying to cultivate "followers" seems to trump semi real world interactions.
---
I actually started to do anomaly often recently (mystic coin and 50s is good value ) and it never failed, there were even few oneshots. Tag and map chat organisation to lure people in is a must, though.
---
Be on time, organize group in lfg if nothing else works. Events in overflow map do tend to fail all over the game.
---
Thank you - yeah, seems like damn near everyone is sending me to WPs vids, so I'll just assume that's cuz he or she know wtf they're talking about. That'll be tonight's "homework".
---
That’s... an interesting family dynamic you have there, Monsieur Oedipus.

"Thought you killed me? Well now I'm in your head. And I'm going to be here for a very VERY long time."

I remember completing them in one day sometimes... :D
---
That sounds like less "blackout drunk" and more "death by alcohol poisoning".
---
I remember doing monthlies in a few hours after reset
---
*hours
---
I have a junk email I've used over the years to subscribe and log in to several hundred places, and I get about 5000 spam mails every month. Currently sitting at over 100k unread, it's hopeless to even begin sorting it out.
---
That's all the guy knows how to do, nitpick and move goalposts so anyone who dislikes anet MUST be wrong.
---
When i said difficulty i wasn't meaning it in the same sense of a raid difficulty. You had to coordinate an entire map of people "doing their things" so the main events could be done to be able to even have a chance at the final mate-event.
---
Verdant Brink -&gt; The real reward here was reaching level 4 of the meta. There was barely enough time during the day time for unorganized maps to complete all the day events. And that meant less camps available to defend during the night. Even bosses were tricky until most part of the people learned how to deal with the mechanics. Today: You can just wait for the matriarch to spawn and kill her in a few seconds for full rewards.
---
Auric Basin -&gt; Here for once the progress in the meta didn't affect as much the final meta-event. You just needed to unlock the waypoints for convenience and the armors, well, you could work without them. But people took long time to learn how to do the mechanics, specially on south. Fortunately this metaevent was quite lenient and not killing the octovines in a syncronized time didn't punish with a game over and gave you a chance to recover. Today: Well, people has mastered this event since that multi tarir thing happened.
---
Tangled Dephths -&gt; Yes, As you say this one had real difficulty before it was nerfed. SCAR used to be particularly difficult. The bosses had a lot of life and SCAR could not take profit of the only weakness of the gerent (don't break his blue bar), and then nuhoch (how many times i saw the event failing because nuhoch could not reach level 0 before the 2nd burn phase). Grent had overall an added difficulty. If people didn't take care of the events on each camp then less resources were available for the final event. For example, in nuhoch people were having problems to reach level 0 with all the mushroom available, and you had less of them available if you didn't compelte the camp events. The nerf here was very well deserved.
---
Dragon Stand -&gt; This map is probably the only one that has not changed much besides a nerf to the foes and the great increase of rewards. The community found soon enough a working tactic to do the towers part and realized that bombing the dragon with bombs taken from the fallen chopper were the key for a fast burn on the last part.
---
Overall, many of the nerfs were needed but right now there's barely no reason to do the normal events on many of the maps unless you are going for achievement completion or something along those lines.
---
A bit more when you had JP but yeah pretty much, dont know why people think monthlies were cool.
---
What does this have to do with GW2? A BlueStacks alternative would mean it is aimed at mobile games. GW2 is not mobile game. If they wanted to make GW2 into a mobile game you would need a solution for  going in the opposite direction.
---
This would have more relevance to Guild Wars if there was/will be an announcement for GW3 since that might be how they approach it.
---
I do :(.
---
Pretty nice. The box designs are better than most GW2 bows. The sword is classy, the torch unique, the shield is large and classy looking. The staff has a really cool look. Overall I think these are very clean designs, without a lot of the "puffery" that GW2 weapons are prone to. Not a fan of the GS, only because I don't like those "axehead" tips. 
---
It's funny, because these are meant to be ancient Norn designs, and some do seem that way, like the Focus, but others, like the sword and shield, both look explicitly Roman in design.
---
I would like for them to return as well.  Kill 100 vets!
---
Yeah, no, ad revenue isn't how Pro League was ever intended to be monetized. That's like paying for a banner ad on a website and expecting to somehow get money directly from that. They use their own internal metrics on things like "how likely a f2p player is to buy the game" and "how many gems new players will spend" to assign estimated values to various metrics they can track as a way to estimate the knes that can't be directly tracked. I understand it would be easier if you could directly compare expenses and returns... but it's just not how it works.
---
How long has this been the norm in this game? (I'm new to it)  
---
I played SWTOR for years and they started beating the Cash Shop drum really early on, even before they basically did away with most raid type content.   
---
This seems to be pretty standard MO for MMO's after a certain period of time. I think WoW doesn't ush it quite as hard because they have a glut of subs at any given time, but they're the outlier.
---
I know how risky the game dev business is. I don't blame then a one bit for taking that guaranteed pay day. I have a lot of problems with Epic, but I'm not blind to how these exclusivity buyouts they're doing help reduce a LOT of risk for smaller studios.
---
I don't keep up to date with their vlog/marketing casts. All I know about the game is that I got to try it out and it was fun. I'm really just happy they managed to secure the funding to keep working on that game.
---
The weapons are supposed to be norn themed? Says who?
---
While muscles don't keep you warm in the same way fat or fur do, they actually do indirectly keep you warm. They demand significant calorie expenditure to maintain, which in turn creates heat. Granted, nowhere near enough to actually counteract freezing climates, but they're already magical animal Vikings so I'm willing to suspend my disbelief.
---
&gt; Braham is also unable to become Wolf
---
In some alternate reality, ANet actually fleshed out the norn in GW2 and made their transformations matter, so this detail would actually mean something to us and would have been noticeable throughout our time with Braham all these years.
---
But in this reality, ANet made this detail totally unimportant.
---
So having her on our side makes the story boring because she will always save us. At this point she is probably stronger than every possible antagonist. 
---
Like Jormag only gets ice powers but she gets the powers of 3 elder dragons combined and Joko  so she's functionally invincible.
---
Right now all antagonists are the underdogs. That eliminates tension from a story telling perspective.
---
mb actually there are 2 more
---
Oh yeah i do remember these. Why'd they take em off?
---
He is trying to say some specs were essentially too good in PvP. Examples, chrono, rev. If you only had the core game, there was nothing you could to compete with the power creeps introduced by HoT.
---
QD champ train made Champ kills a joke.
---
The rewards associated with the collection, the shared aesthetics with the mastery pylons that use magic from the spirits of the wild, the fact that Jhavi uses the focus, this being a Norn centric episode, etc. 
---
What I'm saying is they should be norn themed, but aren't. I don't know if Anet actually wanted them to be Norn themed, but everything points toward it and in that case they're not really fitting at all.
---
I wouldn't have enjoyed playing this episode in first person, but if you would, then you could do that. 
---
One point I do think could have used more direction though was the scene in the cave with the body. That should have either been a full cutscene, or at minimum a "camera hijack" situation.
---
I'm not dumb enough to be happy about getting back something that was taken from me, but I definitely feel better now. The removal of auto-switch between game modes was a huge stick in the wheels for me, maybe now I can start playing WvW as usual again.
---
Happy cake day! It is also my cake day. Your norn looks great!
---
Nothing.
---
Unfortunately we already have a... *shudders*.... "~~witch hunter~~dragon hunter"
---
Thrilling stuff for the gem store i suppose? Pvp is lacking, WvW is lacking, class balancing is lacking, i didn't even log in for the "new" living storys.  Not the prologue nor the recently released episode.  3 or 4 months ago i was happy in Gw2, because i enjoyed my class (chrono mesmer) and had a great roleplay community. But roleplay alone doesn't help when you dont enjoy the game anymore and wait for the next "balance" update that borks you favorite class again. Since that patch that completly destroyed it i started with wow again and didn't bother anymore with gw2.  Left my Roleplay community behind and moved on. For me this game already died, and i was on board since Guild Wars Prophecies.
---
I really hated that she revived in literally the next episode. What a cop out!
---
It's my biggest pet peeve when a narrative can't commit to a shocking twist. It feels cheap.
---
Heh that more or less implemented already with the 'Right-Click to Attack/Interact' option
---
Because they gave players something to do regardless of how long they took? You don't see people saying "why are they called dailies when they only take five minutes durr hurr" but for some reason it's an argument against monthlies.
---
&gt; No, they had an entire year of s4 to make the best s4 they could.
---
Living world exists to give them breathing room and hold us over until the next expansion is ready. It literally existed to give them time for the next expansion.
---
&gt;What would "a movie experience, but delivered as a season of televion" look like? Would it look like two one-hour episodes that are basically each half a movie, followed by a completely different story, or would it be a movie's worth of content split up over a dozen one-hour episodes, using that additional time to flesh out the characters and to pace the series differently than the runtime of a movie would allow?
---
Television episodes don't come once every 4 months. Also most of them are longer than a whisper in the dark. And better writen.
---
&gt;The literal point of it is that 1. You don't have to pay $50 more dollars to play it,
---
Pay 50$ to play what? A shittier living world? I'd rather pay money for quality content than get dogshit for free.
---
&gt;and 2. it isn't all just dumped into our laps at once.
---
Our laps have been waiting for expansion content since season 4.
---
&gt;Same as Raven Bond.
---
No, not the same at all. You immediately get it as soon as you enter the map and doesn't unlock any special rewards because everyone has it by default and the map is designed with that in mind.
---
How exactly are they the same?
---
&gt;But that was part of an expansion. This is a Saga. 
---
And sagas are meant to repalce expansions.
---
&gt;The other masteries will come, but not necessarily in the same patch. 
---
Once again, we've been waiting for expansion content since season 4.
---
&gt;Besides, even if you could all the Exalted masteries as a single bundle, there were only five of those, there were eight released this patch.
---
The masteries are joke tier. They allow you to open doors that were never closed in the first place and allow you to open chests that are literally only locked so the mastery has a reason to exist.
---
&gt;And yet the prologue didn't include one, and you insist that that "was episode 1," so if so, it violated that hard rule. And Whisper brought us eight masteries, so it also broke that rule. Clearly this project is about breaking the old rules. 
---
One of the reasons I suspect the prologue was labeled as such was to avoid having a mastery associated with it. Either way its a special case.
---
&gt;They make the masteries they want to make, no more, no less.
---
"cuz i wanna" is not a good excuse for something.
---
&gt;Or a shitty one AND a good one. Or two shitty ones. Or three shitty and a good. Or five good. Whatever.
---
&gt;Did. We do get eight masteries now.
---
The masteries of whisper in the dark are retarded, stop pretending they're even remotely up to the level of previous masteries.
---
&gt;Mostly, yeah, but otherwise we wouldn't be able to get to the other side at all, so it's a tradeoff. Most gameplay involves some sort of tradeoff.
---
So... the mastery literally introduces a barrier that it helps you overcome, and said barrier wouldn't exist without the mastery to justify itself in the first place? 
---
That's a self fufilling prophecy and categorically shit design.
---
&gt;I don't think that's an accurate characterization. I imagine some people in the company do know, if not the people at that panel. Remember that these releases are done in waves by different groups of people. I would very much hope that with the way this first set of masteries were designed, they have more long-term relevance than some s3 abilities had. Maybe I'll be disappointed, but we won't know until we see future episodes.
---
I like how not even anet counts as a source when they disagree with you.
---
Thank you. =)  Anything you think could be improved upon?
---
Last patches have not been quarterly, in fact, it has been over a year that we haven't had a quarterly balance patch cadence, probably more.
---
They can be used as time units. For example, *It'll be 2070 **when alliances go life***
---
So many period/missed period jokes in our guild chat
---
You don't have to make skimmers shaped exactly like manta rays. Look at the hummingbird one, for example.
---
I'd start with an algae-looking horsefish like the leafy seadragon as a as a base, and from there make it horizontal and extend its fins. to the sides, amking it look even more like algae.
---
I am familiar with your obnoxious whining regarding raids in official forums. I am amazed you made it some sort of basis for an argument on an unrelated subject though.
---
A little bit of a gw2 meme.
---
I particularly liked it when she swooped in, and save almora at the last second.  She would've died otherwise.
---
I belive it when I see it.
---
&gt;Yeah, no, ad revenue isn't how Pro League was ever intended to be monetized.
---
Ad revenue and sponsorships are how tournament organisers make their money. So unless they're being fully paid for, it is still very much an important metric. Not to mention it correlates to how successful the event was.
---
But it does mean that the event is a big upfront loss for ArenaNet.
---
&gt;They use their own internal metrics on things like "how likely a f2p player is to buy the game" and "how many gems new players will spend" to assign estimated values to various metrics they can track as a way to estimate the ones that can't be directly tracked.
---
Yep, but we're talking about broad metrics that do not necessarily correlate. The examples you specify for instance would likely be largely representative of PvE players given the generality, and so on.
---
What I'm trying to say is I find it incredibly hard to believe that when you take the already low viewership, take a subset as viewer-&gt;player conversion, and then factor in player attrition; there would be any meaningful gain. As I said before, seems like a face-saving "It was good marketing" excuse, rather than a successful campaign.
---
I'd like to say, using stealth as a crutch will not make you a good thief, but using stealth attacks appropriately can make you an amazing thief. 2 second knockdown on staff, 2 second immob on bow, blind on sword, massive bleed on pistol, and a nuts alpha strike on dagger or rifle. I've had a lot of success with this build:
---

---
I ran apothecary, back when they released southsun cove it was the best armor for wvw, then fell out of GW2 for a long time. I still run this build in pvp, it's great for 1v1, and +1ing fights. Good for wvw roaming too. I'll replace impairing daggers with shadow refuge if I am in a group. Not great for zergs, but you have your bow, so you can still use it for blast finishers and the poison for interrupts/spamming walls. 
---
As for which armor to use now, I have no idea. I'm still in my old apothecary, but toughness doesn't work against condi, which is a lot of what you run into these days. Used to be almost every roamer ran zerker. Basically, the most important stats are healing power and condi damage. Plague Doc would be my choice, but I think concentration is a wasted stat on this build, since you're not generating many boons.
---
I can't think of anything else than the fact that I want to see these in the game! Though silly little hats never disappoint haha
---
I always foolishly assumed it was something being set up in Switzerland and that's why it would take a while. Now that I've read your link I can't understand what is taking them so long...
---
but the dev's comment didn't really say anything even remotely substantial.
---
I don' want that particulary, I want real glimpses.
---
&gt; I see memes like these on here all the time
---
Irrelevant. The fact that the mods do a bad job of enforcing the rules doesn't change what the rules are.
---
&gt; Not only are you wrongly assuming my intentions
---
I made no mention of your intentions. I pointed out that your post adds nothing new to the conversation and could therefore be considered stirring up drama.
---
&gt; the condescending tone are just unwelcome
---
There is no *tone* to my post. You asked a question and I gave a factual answer to your question. I understand that you don't like those factual answers, but that is indicative of your mindset, not mine.
---
You seem to have decided that one or more of the examples in my post reflect my opinion of you and/or your post. On the contrary, I haven't actually expressed any opinion about your post at all. I've merely answered accurately the question of why people might be down-voting your post.
---
Oh, I think the core gameplay is great. Combat is great, mounts are amazing. And I like the increased communication on balance.  
---
But the utilization of those features in content isn't so great. There's so much they can do with it, but instead 95% of their resources are placed into these story instances and explorable style maps.
---
These are great.  My preference has always been to have mounts that tie directly into the core lore.  I would like to see 
---
-  Charr Car - A raptor mount based on models already in the game 
---
-  Fern Hound- Jackal 
---
-  Golem- Springer that we would either ride like Yoda does Luke, or we get into (I guess that latter would make it more like the haz mat suit).  It would have rocket boots for vertical jumps.
---
Probably not to pay gold because Anet cant fix bugs.
---
&gt;You argue it's an appetizer for the main course. I argue (and I believe ANet is also taking this stance), that done right, it can be the main course too.
---
Except they haven't been doing it right. We've been waiting for content since season 4 and so far all they're doing is delivering more living world with a fancier name and less content.
---
&gt;Well this is the content they're making, so either insist on paying $50 for it, or don't, I don't care.
---
The content they're making is extremely starved and fails to deliver on either expansion or living world front.
---
&gt;Not relevant to the point I was making. Try again.
---
Extremely relevant to the point you were making, it was just unintended.
---
&gt;What would "a movie experience, but delivered as a season of television" look like? 
---
Take a look at literally any serialized show that has been released in the past decade. And again, serialized show episdes do not come out once every 4 months.
---
&gt;Which is true of every locked door or chest in the history of videogames. 
---
No, its actually not true for even a single locked door or chest in any videogame other than guildwars.
---
Locked doors and chests require you to spend resources in some games or seek out a key in another. I.e. They are an obstacle between you and something and you have to overcome. Requiring you to pass some sort of challenge or test to acquire the key so you can gain entry.
---
&gt;Raven locks do not provide you with an obstacle, challenge, or test to overcome.
---
There is not a single videogame that places a locked door in your way and hands you the key upon interracting with it. 
---
Raven locks do not provide you with a test, obstacle or challenge to be overcome.
---
&gt; Everyone gets Exalted Markings too, it's not like any of these abilities are "exclusive" in any way. What difference does it make whether you get the ability for entering the map or for spending a mastery point?
---
Because if you get it upon entering the map there is never an area that its inaccessible to you. You need to unlock exalted markings before you can use them, so yes they are exclusive. I can exist in the map and own exalted markings and access an area a player without them cannot.
---
&gt;Ok? Well you'll get it when it's out, and not a moment sooner. Deal with it.
---
lmao, I like how you ran out of arguments and instead of doing the smart thing and not responding you decided to go with "Deal with it". 
---
&gt;Again, this is a Saga, it's all a special case.
---
So far the only thing special about the saga is how it fails as both living world an expansion.
---
&gt;It does enhance gameplay. Areas that I would be able to fly through without interaction, I now have to dismount, activate the gate, and remount without getting into combat (which would prevent me remounting), which in certain areas, like the ice caves, can be a fun little challenge.
---
We already have that in the core game. Its called "no mount" and "no fly" zones, and they've been around since HoT.
---
&gt;Video games!
---
To quote myself:
---
&gt;Locked doors and chests require you to spend resources in some games or seek out a key in another. I.e. They are an obstacle between you and something and you have to overcome. Requiring you to pass some sort of challenge or test to acquire the key so you can gain entry.
---
&gt;Raven locks do not provide you with an obstacle, challenge, or test to overcome. They are "Press F to pay respects" of guild wars and except press F at least had the excuse of being an interactive cinematic.
---
So, again, not applicable.
---
&gt;I'm saying that "ANet" is not disagreeing with me. You are asserting that your interpretation of what some developers said about their experience on the project.
---
They said they don't know what they're gonna do with masteries past episode 2. Doesn't take a genious to figure that out. Reach any harder and you'll break your back.
---
None of the situations are overall better but for high level players this seems like a win win. Lower match times plus easy noob stomps.
---
if you take minstrels in raids your toughness will be usually high so you'll probably cause some issues on most bosses
---
I don't think that sounds unreasonable. I think community interaction is a big deal. My assumption of a lack of transparency on their part is that a lot of what they're working with may or may not be in a nebulous state. 
---
I think they were lucky to survive the death-blow they were dealt, and that I hope they make it back on their feet fully, even if it takes time. I strongly believe they're still trying to pull themselves back from that.
---
you dont even take full Vipers on condi Fb anymore
---
See my previous Post for my alternative to a "Charr Car". I can't see Anet introducing a skin that has such a different footprint to the default skin, as it would not visually match the move set.
---
Jackal here is a fern hound. As written in the notes, to preserve the in-game lore of the jackal being able to teleport I chose against depicting it as a regular fern hound, and opted to make it partially out of water, with the water fulfilling the function of the sand on the default jackal skin, and flowers fulfilling the function of the rune stones.
---
I can't see Anet introducing a skin that we get \*into\* as IIRC; they said a few years ago (before mounts) that they didn't want mounts to obscure the player character. A Golem mount with boosters would work for springer though.
---
Thankyou. =3
---
That would be indeed a pretty nice addition too! I always enjoyed the atmosphere that Dead Space devs created.
---
What is the cap on monthly and/or daily AP?
---
Most of my characters got PvE build and WvW build, that makes two (2) builds! Now some of my characters got third (3rd) PvE-based build, thanks to templates. Only few of my characters use one (1) build in all gamemodes.
---
Just do what ff14 does and make have it implied you did it by yourself the entire time anyway
---
They really should come back, at least to give us some extra mystic coin.
---
And tbh, more population on jps and wvw would be nice.
---
&gt; Except they haven't been doing it right. We've been waiting for content since season 4 and so far all they're doing is delivering more living world with a fancier name and less content.
---
"Season 4" was six months ago, you act like it's been years. There was a longer gap waiting for the first episode of Season 3, and they've already released two episodes of this story. You want instant gratification, you want "an expansion worth of content" in a single episode, they never promised that. They promised "an expansion's worth of content" over a full Saga of releases, and with any luck they will deliver on that. Neither of us have any way of knowing whether they will or won't. You might not agree with that plan, and that's fine, but that isn't them failing, it's just you having a different opinion on what *you* would prefer they do. 
---
&gt;The content they're making is extremely starved and fails to deliver on either expansion or living world front.
---
The Prologue was at least LS-worthy. The first episode was LS-*quality,* but was certainly shorter than we're used to. Whether that length is *justified* depends on future releases. Again, if future releases are either better or faster than we're used to to a degree that makes up for this one's shortness, then it all balances out, and I genuinely prefer that to them forcing consistency between releases at the cost of making each the best it can be. I fully agree with you that we haven't seen "expansion worthy" "extras" *yet,* I just fully believe that we *will.* Maybe I'll be wrong, maybe they'll get through the entire Saga and nothing major will have been included, but I doubt that. 
---
&gt;Take a look at literally any serialized show that has been released in the past decade. And again, serialized show episdes do not come out once every 4 months.
---
They also don't dump their entire plot in the first couple episodes, they draw it out over the course of the season, which is what I expect here. TV series that shoot their load in the pilot tend to sputter out. 
---
&gt;No, its actually not true for even a single locked door or chest in any videogame other than guildwars.
---
Name one game that includes locked doors or chests in which the locks do not exist *only* for the player to be able to unlock them. 
---
That's one sort of lock, and GW2 has those, but it's not the only sort. For example, there are locked doors in Metroid that can be opened by shooting them with your gun. These function like Raven Locks, they are a sealed barrier through which you cannot pass, but from the start of the game you are given the key to open them. In this case, the gameplay mechanic is not forcing you to find a specific key elsewhere, it is merely forcing an interaction. 
---
The point of the Raven Bond is a lore one, that the Commander who existed before the first chapter of the story did not have this tool, and would have been unable to interact with these devices. The plot handed you the tool to advance, much as Zelda might hand you a sword, or Silent Hill might hand you a board with a nail in it. The Commander at the end of the first chapter has different capabilities than she had before it, and different capabilities than most beings in Tyria. The Commander has a bond with Raven that allows her to overcome these barriers that most people could not. It does not need to have any purpose beyond that. 
---
&gt;Because if you get it upon entering the map there is never an area that its inaccessible to you. You need to unlock exalted markings before you can use them, so yes they are exclusive. I can exist in the map and own exalted markings and access an area a player without them cannot.
---
Yes, but because they are relatively effortless to earn, it's a distinction without a difference. Good job guy, you can do something that someone else can't do for another ten minutes while they unlock that ability. It takes longer to gain the mastery to unlock one of those color-locked chests in the Bjora Marches than it does to unlock Exalted Mastery. 
---
&gt;lmao, I like how you ran out of arguments and instead of doing the smart thing and not responding you decided to go with "Deal with it". 
---
At some point, it's the only option available to you. /shrug. This is the way they are releasing content. You can either make peace with that, or not. There's nothing more I can do to help.
---
&gt;So far the only thing special about the saga is how it fails as both living world an expansion.
---
So far, the Saga is not over, so it's impossible to judge the full scope of it. I mean, what rating would you give The Sixth Sense at the 10 minute mark? 
---
&gt;We already have that in the core game. Its called "no mount" and "no fly" zones, and they've been around since HoT.
---
That's something different though. That actually forces you off the mount, and prevents you from getting back on. It's an aggressive act. This is one that *you* initiate, so you can plan it out to your own advantage. Timed right you are only dismounted for a split second and then can get moving again, but it still puts you at more risk than if you could just fly right through at top speed. Putting a no-fly zone in there would have a very different pacing to it. 
---
&gt;They said they don't know what they're gonna do with masteries past episode 2. 
---
[Here's the exact quote.](https://youtu.be/BAHZPRFPOZ4?t=3052) He says that episode 2 will include it, but he also *intends* to continue using them, just that they aren't *committing* to using them, because maybe players don't like these abilities and don't want to use them more. Again, Anet seems to hate publicly committing to *anything* more than one patch out, so this is no surprise. I still believe we're *likely* to see them continue to be used to some degree in future content.
---
I use nevermore on my alacrigade, and it looks fine
---
You aren't Nick?
---
Braham's Armor, Brajam's Wolfblood Outfit, and the Balthazar hounds shoulders from LS3 are the most wintry things I can think of besides Norn cultural sets.
---
let me explain you since i'm from italy food is not a joke.
---
the mexican-chinese-italian-japanese restaurant do not sell food. they sell trash.
---
specialize in something and do it well.
---
oh and by the way : pizza is not something you do from a day to another. pizza requires your restaurant to have a oven which uses wood to function. any other kind of pizza is not pizza. not to mention you should know how to do it , use the proper kind of mozzarella and not a chemical shit. there are different types of pizza - romana (pala) , trancio, napoletana and so on. 
---
you do not simply cook a èizza in a restaurant. suppose in england everything would be ok (said the place with the worse food i ever had in my life) but it's not
---
it's the same for a game and raids
---
this game started without raid. this is the main reason i left wow and came here 7 years ago.
---
every single developer which is wasting time on raiding is doing something which is against the reason i love this game.
---
raiding did only bad to this game. check lfg : there are ppl asking for raiding currency for the strike.
---
&gt;"Season 4" was six months ago, you act like it's been years. There was a longer gap waiting for the first episode of Season 3, and they've already released two episodes of this story. You want instant gratification, you want "an expansion worth of content" in a single episode, they never promised that. 
---
I want an expansion's worth of content after waiting an entire season for an expansion.
---
&gt;Neither of us have any way of knowing whether they will or won't. You might not agree with that plan, and that's fine, but that isn't them failing, it's just you having a different opinion on what you would prefer they do.
---
You should really cut out the whole "anet works in mysterious ways" shtick. The game has been around for more than half a decade, we know how anet operates by now.
---
&gt;They also don't dump their entire plot in the first couple episodes, they draw it out over the course of the season, which is what I expect here. TV series that shoot their load in the pilot tend to sputter out.
---
And once again, they draw it out, because new episodes come out weekly not once every 4 months.
---
&gt; Name one game that includes locked doors or chests in which the locks do not exist only for the player to be able to unlock them.
---
None because this isn't the argument.
---
The argument is that none of them give you the key immediately without any challenge, resources or effort, thereby invalidating them.
---
&gt;That's one sort of lock, and GW2 has those, but it's not the only sort. For example, there are locked doors in Metroid that can be opened by shooting them with your gun. These function like Raven Locks, they are a sealed barrier through which you cannot pass, but from the start of the game you are given the key to open them. In this case, the gameplay mechanic is not forcing you to find a specific key elsewhere, it is merely forcing an interaction.
---
Metroid came out 3 decades ago and had a completely different design philosophy from guild wars. 
---
Also, guild wars is not a metroid/metroidvania style game.
---
Also, in metroid the gun was not an entire mastery.
---
&gt;The point of the Raven Bond is a lore one, that the Commander who existed before the first chapter of the story did not have this tool, and would have been unable to interact with these devices.
---
Lore should exist to serve the gameplay in a gameplay based game, not the other way around. 
---
&gt;Yes, but because they are relatively effortless to earn, it's a distinction without a difference. Good job guy, you can do something that someone else can't do for another ten minutes while they unlock that ability. It takes longer to gain the mastery to unlock one of those color-locked chests in the Bjora Marches than it does to unlock Exalted Mastery.
---
Its an overwhelmingly massive difference whether or not you need to earn something and whether or not you need to be handed something.
---
&gt;At some point, it's the only option available to you. /shrug. This is the way they are releasing content. You can either make peace with that, or not. There's nothing more I can do to help.
---
There is a lot you can do to help actually, you can start by calling anet out on being lazy and delivery hacky content so they shape up instead of stroking their ego and assisting their downfall.
---
&gt;So far, the Saga is not over, so it's impossible to judge the full scope of it. I mean, what rating would you give The Sixth Sense at the 10 minute mark?
---
I don't need to wait 8 months until the rest of the sixth sense comes out and I wasn't waiting 8 months to get to those 10 minutes in the first place (again season 4)
---
&gt;That's something different though. That actually forces you off the mount, and prevents you from getting back on. It's an aggressive act. This is one that you initiate, so you can plan it out to your own advantage. Timed right you are only dismounted for a split second and then can get moving again, but it still puts you at more risk than if you could just fly right through at top speed. Putting a no-fly zone in there would have a very different pacing to it.
---
You're pulling a retarded ammount of mental gymnastics to try and pretend that "Dismount and Press F, then remound" is a legendary heroic act of epic states and vast consequences. 
---
The entire point of risk is rendered moot because open world is stupidly easy in the first place.
---
&gt;Here's the exact quote. He says that episode 2 will include it, but he also intends to continue using them, just that they aren't committing to using them, because maybe players don't like these abilities and don't want to use them more. 
---
So, not only do they have no plan, but they don't have a creative vision for what they want to do either? How does this help your point? It only confirms they still don't know what they want to do with the saga.
---
This is ingame since launch.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Box_o%27_Fun#Petrify_Mode
---
Yea but thats a box o fun thing.. having to go through all the shit that box gives.. wouldn't it be nicer to just have a toy that only does that?
---
after 7+ year , arenanet should answer with action , not asking for more hope, i think this is pretty disrespectful for us that have believe in arenanet for soo many year, with no road map , a fragile game with new bugs every release , a lot of stuff left to die (guild hall and guild content, dungeons , world bosses and other stuff, spvp esport)... but again they ask for hope...
---
Good old days.
---
after 7 year they discover that ppl want a road map... meh he is a genius
---
Its called a credit card
---
I don't think you understand the problem with legendaries.
---
Believe it or not, the way it is now, is actually OKAY...for everything expect legendary.
---
Account-wide legendary is NOT the issue with legendaries. It's just something that some people want; but, it's not an actual issue...it never was.
---
Legendaries automatically unequipping upgrades IS an actual issue.
---
How about coexistance?
---
I know the problem with legendaries, I have legendary armor in all 3 weights, I'm saying there is also a problem with ascended as well.
---
&gt; I want an expansion's worth of content after waiting an entire season for an expansion.
---
Well that's too bad then, because that's not how ANet is doing it. Talk to the Oompa Loompas, Veruca. 
---
&gt;You should really cut out the whole "anet works in mysterious ways" shtick. The game has been around for more than half a decade, we know how anet operates by now.
---
You would think, right? But then there's you, fully expecting them to behave differently. /shrug.
---
&gt;And once again, they draw it out, because new episodes come out weekly not once every 4 months.
---
Irrelevant to the example. If you're going to get hung up about that, then don't compare it to TV episodes in a season, compare it to full TV seasons, which release a year apart, or compare it to movie trilogies, where they release a year or more apart. The point is, if they set out with a long arc to tell, then they don't just dump all the good stuff into the first one and then put out a bunch of trash (aside from the Matrix movies), they instead dole out the content in portions that keep the pacing going. Again, if you're right, no "expansion worthy" content exists, and if so, there's really no conversation to be had. If I'm right, then "expansion worthy" content will come out at the time and place best suited for that content to be. Since we don't even know that form that content will take or what the shape of the story will be, it's hard to even guess when that will be, it could be next episode, it could be right near the end for all we know. 
---
Neither of us can prove out position is correct until the Saga is complete, so I'm not sure why you keep going around in circles on this point. 
---
&gt;The argument is that none of them give you the key immediately without any challenge, resources or effort, thereby invalidating them.
---
Except Metroid, of course. 
---
&gt;Metroid came out 3 decades ago and had a completely different design philosophy from guild wars. 
---
Ok?
---
&gt;Also, guild wars is not a metroid/metroidvania style game.
---
It kinda is, in a *lot* of ways. Again, you should watch Gamemaker's Toolkit, it will blow your mind.
---
&gt;Also, in metroid the gun was not an entire mastery.
---
Again, you seem *really* hung up on what is and is not "a mastery," when all a "mastery" is is just an arbitrary way for the developers to and the player new tools. It's not a big deal.
---
&gt;Lore should exist to serve the gameplay in a gameplay based game, not the other way around. 
---
Says who? Both inform each other, and you can have gameplay that is primarily about highlighting lore, or lore that exists only to serve the gameplay. The Raven Bond mastery does both.
---
&gt;Its an overwhelmingly massive difference whether or not you need to earn something and whether or not you need to be handed something.
---
Not really when the time it takes to "earn" it is relatively negligible relative to the time you spend after that. I mean, I earned the Exalted Markings mastery four years ago. I've had it for roughly 35,000 more hours than it took me to unlock it. In four years time, I'll have had the Raven's Bond mastery for 35,000 hours longer than it took me to unlock it. In the grand scheme of things, it does not matter and is not worth all this whining over.
---
&gt;you can start by calling anet out on being lazy and delivery hacky content so they shape up instead of stroking their ego and assisting their downfall.
---
But I don't believe that to be true. I don't believe they are being lazy or hacky, my belief is that they are allocating their resources as best they can, to make the big and important content as big and important as possible, and the smaller content good at that as well. Now again, maybe I'll be wrong, both of us will know the answer to that in a year or so, but neither of us can know the answer to that before then.
---
&gt;I don't need to wait 8 months until the rest of the sixth sense comes out and I wasn't waiting 8 months to get to those 10 minutes in the first place (again season 4)
---
Irrelevant. The time you need to wait between portions of the whole is not the point. The point is that you can't judge an entire story by only a portion of it. Other comparisons to make would be novels in a series that only come out every few years, for example. You can obviously judge each book as it comes out, but you cannot accurately say that the entire series is good or bad until the last book comes out.
---
&gt;You're pulling a retarded ammount of mental gymnastics to try and pretend that "Dismount and Press F, then remound" is a legendary heroic act of epic states and vast consequences. 
---
I never claimed that it *was* a "legendary heroic act of epic states and vast consequences." All *I* said was that it was an additional gameplay interaction, which it is. It has a small impact, but an impact nonetheless, and that's all it needs to be. You're the one that is insistent that every tiny detail they put in *needs* to be some "legendary heroic act of epic states and vast consequences."
---
Balance. 
---
&gt;The entire point of risk is rendered moot because open world is stupidly easy in the first place.
---
Not every risk needs to be life or death. The odds of one of those leading to my character dying are next to nil. The odds that my character will get tagged and pulled into combat, delaying the time it would take me to be able to remount and fly away, however, are significantly higher. That inconvenience, to me, is plenty of threat to keep me engaged, to *want* to "do well." To each their own though.
---
&gt;So, not only do they have no plan, but they don't have a creative vision for what they want to do either?
---
Again, that is not what they said. What they said is that they were not *publicly committing* to anything right now. If you've been paying attention, this is exactly how ANet has operated for the past seven years (likely more). I would assert that they do have plans, but that because these seasons/sagas *do* take place over long periods of time, they want to maintain flexibility. 
---
Let's explore a hypothetical. Let's say that they do have firm plans for how to use these abilities in episode 2. Let's say that they also have firm plans on how they intend to use them in episode 3. But now they are getting feedback about the powers based on episode 1. A lot of people, myself included, find them a bit clunky, want them to behave differently. That would alter what they have planned for epsiode 3. Episode 2 is already too far along to make any significant changes, so it stays as is, but for episode 3 they tweak the abilities a bit, also tweaking how they are intended to play into that episode's content. How would you describe that situation? "For episode 2, that's something we're committed to. . . post episode 2, that stuff is being designed out. . . we are keeping that in mind and wanting to bring that forward. We aren't absolutely tied to it, but we don't want to *abandon* it for any reason."
---
How could he be more definitive that they intend to use them in future, *without* absolutely locking them in to definitely using them more in the future, even if everything indicates that that would be a bad idea due to changing circumstances?
---
The sore reason I stopped playing and never returned since loadouts came into game.
---
&gt;That's just how marketing works, dude. 
---
Did I say otherwise? The point was to assess overall benefit, and this is not just pure conventional marketing in the first place.
---
&gt;Companies literally hire people specialized in those fields to find appropriate metrics so they can base decisions off of them.
---
Yeah, but we're not talking about "companies" in general, we're talking about ArenaNet specifically and a failed attempt at launching an eSports scene.
---
Do also note that during this time period, many studios attempted this same manoeuvre of me-too-esports. I don't see this particular tactic being used much if at all now, which is very telling.
---
&gt;If you honestly think your random assumptions about metrics they may or may not have used are more accurate than the ones calculated by people who do so professionally, then I don't know what to tell you.
---
Heh, we're just taking claims from ArenaNet at face value now? You attempt to cast my response as "random assumptions", but yet I think I've been quite straightforward in my reasoning. Certainly more substantial than an appeal to authority fallacy.
---
In any case, believe what you want. This previously interesting discussion is becoming increasingly churlish, so I'm done here. Thanks for the back and forth.
---
Only if “do dailies” wasn’t one of the monthlies ;)
---
Weeklies with bonus rewards for rotating dungeons, raids, meras, Jps, etc. would be great!
---
They were also a great way to get a whole array of different cancers from reading the map chat.
---
I'm kind of surprised that no one is trying to set up a champ train in Bjora. Those champs are up all the time and there's even an achievement for killing them all AND a daily achievement for killing one.
---
The rewards need some tuning but yes I don't agree they are better than raids because they aren't meant to be they are meant to teach mechanics normally used in raids.
---
Why do you think that's the majority of people? I don't see evidence of that. In fact, I see evidence of the exact opposite. The number of people who don't even know what a break bar is is staggering. 
---
A while back a dev gave out a statistic that blew my mind. He said some ridiculously high number of players have never been to the trait screen. I don't remember but it was something like 40%.  Most people don't raid or PvP in any game, and this has been known for a very long time.
---
A Lotro dev from back in the day, when he left Lotro, said that only 10% of the population ever Pvped or Raided in that game for the entire time of the game's existence. However, they accounted for 50% of forum posts. 
---
I don't believe the harder core community that wants to be challenged is as big as you believe, or, more importantly perhaps, I believe there are people being challenged by much easier content than you are. To them, they're being challenged. They're essentially soloing content, they don't join guilds, they don't go to websites.  That's my best guess.
---
I could be wrong but there's a lot of evidence supporting what I'm saying that I've gleaned from games and devs over the years. 
---
Scott Hartsman of Rift fame said early on that MMO developers ignore solo players at their own risk and despite that, early on, Rift ended up apologizing to the playerbase because people were leaving in droves because there wasn't enough solo content. The same thing happened later with Wildstar a game billed as having a robust raiding end game. The paraphrasing of the devs was that we had no idea so many people would want fun solo activities and we're going to work as hard as we can to add them. In the case of Rift it was too little too late.
---
Anet originallly nerfed Orr and later on, they had to go back and spend one of their quarterly updates to make HOT more solo friendly. They took some champs and made them vets. They took out mobs in areas to lower population density. They included those massively easy vet events all round for people who literally couldn't handle anything else. 
---
Triple threat is the least done world boss in the game, and TD had to be nerfed because it was just too hard for people. 
---
Virtually every MMO gets easier over time, and there's a reason for it.  Just my observations, but I think if you talk to industry insiders you'll find there are far more casuals who either don't know that they're not playing well or they don't care.
---
Furthermore, one of the devs said recently that a good player does 500% more damage than the average player in Guild Wars 2. 500%. He didn't say a bad player, he said an average player. Which means that probably most of this game isn't really probably looking for a challenge. Most people are probably looking to come home from work and kill some shit before bed.
---
the great combat system exist inside or outside raid.  
---
raid training exist cause community is non existent and need for more pp
---
raid static is just like pointless from the game point of view . you are in or out and most of the time is guild only. so random player won't ever do that.
---
coexistence is not possibile when raiding community ask raiding stuff outside raid . btw not a real problem anymore. strikes are the new way tx god . let's all hope they will change all raid to strikes so that ppl can join for a single one pugging .
---
You are wrong. With your logic only popular topics would have wikipedia pages. After all, whats the chance anyone will ever look up anything else... Or papers, theres papers written that at the most a handful of people ever read.
---
You make a guide because you want to share something you discovered. Nothing more, nothing less. Sometimes absolutely brilliant guides (like teapots adina video btw) get completely ignored, sometimes something really small and obvious gets watched/read thousand times. Anyone making guides/playthroughs/whatever regularly knows this. And still we keep on doing it, even if theres a good chance nobody will ever watch/read it. Because just putting it out there is enough.
---
Casual -&gt; without putting in much effort. Timewise and/or skillwise. Making a guide video -&gt; effort.
---
They were never a "huge" chunk of the community. Even fairly early on they were struggling to rope as many players as possible into doing some WvW or PvP. Remember when they added the Legendary Wings to try and strongarm players into doing PvP stuff? PvPers were a *visible* part of the community, largely because they were particularly vocal about elements that weren't going their way, but they were always a vocal minority, with a voice far outsized to their actual numbers. And of course PvPers knew plenty of other PvPers, were in guilds with other PvPers, so to them it looked like PvPers as far as the eye could see, but the reality is that most barely even dabbled in those modes.
---
It is a Sylvian Hound. Read the red text.
---
From what I recall: Greatsword is nice to have for range, but in most situations I wouldn't want to miss out on the sword phantasm (both for the damage and the might), nor the focus pull.
---
Without greatsword, Domination can't compete with dueling so I'd run Dueling-Illusions-Chronomancer instead.
---
Phantasmal Defender is also pretty useless - the skill itself is slow and the taunt never seems worth it to me. While the damage is good on paper, very few mobs will ever hit it enough to build it up so it's just weak all-round. You're much better off with Manta of Pain if you want an extra source of damage (and vuln). There are a lot of good options for utilities (I even run Well of Recall and SoI for longer fights), but Phantasmal Defender isn't one of them IMO.
---
I'm not disagreeing with you. Back in the day (I'm 57) we watched a TV episode and we had a week to think about it, before the next one came out. And there weren't that many to follow. Today you have so many entertainment options, you're so distracted that thinking about anything deeply is a lot art.
---
I saw it with my kids growing up. The first solution they came upon for any problem with the best and only solution. There was no logical thought process. No testing an idea to see if there was somthing that you could do that was better.  I taught them, and man it was painful, to think critically but believe me, it was an uphill battle. 
---
But in this case, I don't believe it's kids or cell phones. I think people playing this game are people with kids who can't necessarily devote a lot of time and energy beyond logging in and doing the easy stuff that's in their face. 
---
The age of the average gamer is in their 30s and I'm a lot older than that. Sometimes I'm just sore and tired and while I dont' mind the occasional challenge, my body isn't really up for hours of intensity or practice. Sometimes it's just that I'm going to be interupted by real life every few minutes for the next six hours and raiding under those circumstances would be impossible. 
---
Everyone has different circumstances. And some of us are much better at things other than gaming.
---
Your dispute about rule 2 is irrelevant, since he's talking about readers, not mods, reactions. Downvotes for one image macro and upvotes for another mean that rule 2 is shit and irrelevant unless enforced by mods - and it isn't.  
---
&gt; I made no mention of your intentions.   
---
You did. "Do not post to stir up drama" rule talks specifically about intention to cause drama. By talking about this rule you are implying OP wants drama.  
---
&gt; There is no tone to my post. You asked a question and I gave a factual answer to your question. I understand that you don't like those factual answers, but that is indicative of your mindset, not mine.  
---
You've set the tone of your answer when you interjected with irrelevant to factuality remarks - "but you have managed to hit a trifecta", "that's at least 3 unsurprising reasons".  
---
If you want to flaunt your factuality, you need to relay facts only. Facts being "you broke 3 rules, rule 1, rule 2, and rule 3."  
---
&gt; You seem to have decided that one or more of the examples in my post reflect my opinion of you and/or your post.   
---
You included an opinion in your answer, and it's not at all wrong of OP to think it is actually your opinion.  
---
&gt; I've merely answered **pseudo**-accurately the question of why people might be down-voting your post.
---
He's right; it's just that you see meme crap all the time because rules are hardly ever actually enforced
---
HAhahaha
---
The sub rules don't actually apply to many of the submissions that break them, apparently
---
Apparently they'll do something about it. I'm eager to see how they implement it exactly.
---
Who remembers Yearlies?
---
Why do you feel they are "much easier to get into" ?
---
I just don't understand the difference between raids and strike mission, honestly, just like I fail to see the differences between seasons and saga.
---
They striped everything from a raid expect for the boss fight: no new environment (its the Invitation boss room) or boss models, no lore books or other interactable items like we saw in raids, no unique rewards. 
---
And to be clear, I am not saying that reusing assets is a bad thing - already from W1 to W7 we have bosses that uses already existing models. 
---
If "strike missions" are to be the training wheels to then get into raids, I think they are doing a fine job: I didn't expect a tutorial on how and when to use the special action key, but we got it with this episode masteries. Hopefully they can do something about how important boons are (maybe thought a W7 pylons mechancis) and how break bar works ?
---
i would vote for CMs yes
---
1. 2-4 months imo. Really depending on how much you focus leveling vs exploring. 
---
2. A butt load. You can do almost anything in the game solo. 
---
3. imo figure out a super easy button to press. Maybe a gaming mouse with a thumb button. Try your best to learn how to dodge, it's not Dark Souls necessary but its pretty important.
---
Strike missions fits better into gw2. You can play whatever you want there. Raids takes too much time to organize group.
---
I've not played PvP since shortly after PoF launch
---
Oh this little bastards Aggro range is crazy long..
---
Because the rewards for these strikes are worse than the first strike in the prologue and if you want people to keep doing them you need the rewards to incentive them.
---
Dude those fuckin harpy’s are their god damn big dick dps is out of control
---
I think he meant the Awakened Canids, but they're both really annoying.
---
May I put in Bristlebacks? Getting almost insta-downed if you can't avoid their scale volley is really frustrating.
---
ppl doing world bosses / jumping puzzles / dungeons / etc and the reward sucks. So no proplem on this side
---
Just auto attack them once to get rid of the blind.
---
If you have at all decent burst, they aren't too bad once they stop being invulnerable (although you're often at like 40% hp by then). 
---
2 vets is hardmode though.
---
Definitely my least favorite enemies.
---
Well, here are some for you then: 
---
* Desmina and the continuation of W5
---
* Wizard's Tower
---
* Malyck's Tree
---
* Lyssa (because of her involvements in the story related to Balth)
---
* Largos
---
* The Tengu as you said
---
* Ascalon Ghosts
---
Dw tho, Never in our lifetimes will anet run out of ideas for raids, because they aren't making any :D
---
My only critic is that they are usually more detailed with floral stuff, like your jackel..Wyvern wings would be too simplistic I think.
---
"Anyone who plays differently than I agree with is wrong"  
---
I know some folks with physical disabilities who play as an escape but are literally physically incapable of following any kind of rotation.  But nope, everything has to be because people are " stuck in comfort zone too deep to interact with others" or to "git good".  To be honest, I am actually impressed at you overcoming your own disability.  It must be hard to play with your head lodged up your own ass.

I liked monthly achievements and I miss them actually, it'd be nice for them to return with more long-form goals rather than stuff that COULD take a month of very casual play but most people finished casually within a week, like myself, or super quickly like others have said in days or hours.
---
Could also properly split each game type with it's own monthlies meaning those peeps who are really into ALL game modes are extra rewarded but lets people who mostly stick to one game type still get an alright reward as well.
---
As dailies are worth 2G it wouldn't be unfair to expect 20G or more for monthlies but realistically I think (under the system I proposed) that'd be a little too much, if it was like dailies are now (as in all game modes clumped in) then I'd say 20G would be fine.

taskbar =/= dock

Charr Warclaw should just be a Charr riding on the back of another Charr.
---
Maybe then players should reorient their definition what is repeatable from "rewards" to "fun".
---
Anet should make more weekly bonus events again. The stuff they did with the world bosses worked well to at least get people into those maps again.

&gt; You only have to do it one t16 once
---
Well if it does work then count me in after the current league.
---
&gt; relocating that is what, few minutes?
---
Unfortunately not for me. I tend to always have those 2 Dex or 4 Int lacking somewhere. More like 15-20 min per character. That's why I stopped bothering.
---
I love building a character as he gains levels but all at once... ugh.
---
"Repetiton" and "Fun" don't often go hand-in-hand, unfortunetely
---
Not without a carrot on a stick, that is

I would never open 1000 mistborn chests

I give you an ascended weapon if you do it

omg omg omg omg

I also remember getting a shit ton of mystic coins from daylies. So much so that it got to the point that 1 would cost 5 copper on the trading post

Not codified but you can find examples of well done interfaces, it would be under the UI or UX category. Its not even as good as the arcdps build templates and that is fairly basic. Having said that there are some clearly understood principles of UI/UX design such as minimising button clicks and time.
---
Doesn't matter Team USA will win them all anyway.
---
I've said for years that any implementation of build templates would fail to saticfy the community simply because everyone got different ideas for what templates means.  
---
Build loadouts is one of those concepts that always came up in the conversation and clearly is what a lot of people wanted. So if you are asking if anyone requested build loadouts, the answer is yes. On paper it actually sounded quite good to those who suffers from a lack of inventory space. It also solved a lot of the technical issues for what the system should do when it can't find the right gear in your inventory.

They have meh rewards, and have no reason to do more than one time for the achievement.

&gt;I’m not going to argue with somebody who’s hell bent on being negative no matter what “lol gem shop” being the center of their argument
---
Um... that wasn't my argument. It was an example. I said you *could* spin it that way and it would "support" that argument just as much as it "supports" yours, as in, it would be equally nonsensical. The rest of your post, well... I question who of us should grow up.

People don't like deimos because you need a hk, and yes the oil. And noone wants to do those lol.
